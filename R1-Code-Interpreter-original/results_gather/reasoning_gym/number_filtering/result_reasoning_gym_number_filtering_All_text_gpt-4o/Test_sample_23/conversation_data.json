    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given list of numbers and remove any numbers that are smaller than 83.518. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input**: We have a list of strings representing numbers: `['97.6', '-70.01', '68.2', '-39.61']`.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: Since the list contains strings, we need to convert these strings to floating-point numbers to perform numerical comparisons.\n\n3. **Comparison**: We need to compare each number in the list to the threshold value of 83.518. If a number is smaller than 83.518, it should be removed from the list.\n\n4. **Create a New List**: We will create a new list that only includes numbers that are greater than or equal to 83.518.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: Once we have the filtered list of numbers, we need to convert them back to strings to match the format of the original list.\n\n6. **Return the Result**: Finally, we will return the new list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given list:\n\n- Convert each string to a float:\n  - '97.6' becomes 97.6\n  - '-70.01' becomes -70.01\n  - '68.2' becomes 68.2\n  - '-39.61' becomes -39.61\n\n- Compare each number to 83.518:\n  - 97.6 is greater than 83.518, so it remains in the list.\n  - -70.01 is less than 83.518, so it is removed.\n  - 68.2 is less than 83.518, so it is removed.\n  - -39.61 is less than 83.518, so it is removed.\n\n- The new list of numbers is [97.6].\n\n- Convert the numbers back to strings:\n  - 97.6 becomes '97.6'\n\n- The final list of strings is ['97.6'].\n\n- Return the result enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<['97.6']>>>"
