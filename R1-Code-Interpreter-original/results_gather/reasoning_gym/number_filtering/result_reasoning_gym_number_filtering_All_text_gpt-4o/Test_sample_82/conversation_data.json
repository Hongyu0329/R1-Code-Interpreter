    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the given list of numbers and keep only those that are smaller than 17.98. Let's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the List**: The list provided is `['12.54', '33.2', '25', '-69.2921', '34.95', '16.3289']`. These are string representations of numbers.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: To compare these values with 17.98, we need to convert them from strings to floating-point numbers.\n\n3. **Comparison**: We will compare each number with 17.98 and keep only those numbers that are smaller.\n\n4. **Create a New List**: We will create a new list containing only the numbers that meet the condition.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: Since the original list contains numbers as strings, we will convert the filtered numbers back to strings to maintain the same format.\n\n6. **Format the Output**: Finally, we will format the new list within triple angle brackets as requested.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- Convert each string in the list to a float:\n  - '12.54' -> 12.54\n  - '33.2' -> 33.2\n  - '25' -> 25.0\n  - '-69.2921' -> -69.2921\n  - '34.95' -> 34.95\n  - '16.3289' -> 16.3289\n\n- Compare each number with 17.98:\n  - 12.54 < 17.98 (True)\n  - 33.2 < 17.98 (False)\n  - 25.0 < 17.98 (False)\n  - -69.2921 < 17.98 (True)\n  - 34.95 < 17.98 (False)\n  - 16.3289 < 17.98 (True)\n\n- Numbers that are smaller than 17.98: 12.54, -69.2921, 16.3289\n\n- Convert these numbers back to strings:\n  - 12.54 -> '12.54'\n  - -69.2921 -> '-69.2921'\n  - 16.3289 -> '16.3289'\n\n- Create the new list: `['12.54', '-69.2921', '16.3289']`\n\n- Format the output within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<['12.54', '-69.2921', '16.3289']>>>"
