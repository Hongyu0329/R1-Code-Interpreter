    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given list of numbers and filter out those that are smaller than 37.6. Let's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the List**: The list provided is `['53.8791', '-41.6', '58.03', '-69', '-13.3034']`. These are string representations of numbers, and we need to compare their numerical values.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: To compare these values with 37.6, we need to convert them from strings to numbers (specifically, floating-point numbers).\n\n3. **Comparison**: We will compare each number to 37.6 and determine if it is smaller.\n\n4. **Filter the List**: We will create a new list containing only those numbers that are smaller than 37.6.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: Since the final list needs to be in the same format as the original, we will convert the numbers back to strings.\n\n6. **Format the Output**: The final list should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps:\n\n- Convert each string to a float:\n  - '53.8791' becomes 53.8791\n  - '-41.6' becomes -41.6\n  - '58.03' becomes 58.03\n  - '-69' becomes -69.0\n  - '-13.3034' becomes -13.3034\n\n- Compare each number to 37.6:\n  - 53.8791 is not smaller than 37.6\n  - -41.6 is smaller than 37.6\n  - 58.03 is not smaller than 37.6\n  - -69.0 is smaller than 37.6\n  - -13.3034 is smaller than 37.6\n\n- Filter the list to include only numbers smaller than 37.6:\n  - The numbers that are smaller are -41.6, -69.0, and -13.3034.\n\n- Convert these numbers back to strings:\n  - -41.6 becomes '-41.6'\n  - -69.0 becomes '-69'\n  - -13.3034 becomes '-13.3034'\n\n- Format the output list:\n  - The new list is `['-41.6', '-69', '-13.3034']`.\n\nFinally, we present the answer in the required format:\n\n<<<['-41.6', '-69', '-13.3034']>>>"
