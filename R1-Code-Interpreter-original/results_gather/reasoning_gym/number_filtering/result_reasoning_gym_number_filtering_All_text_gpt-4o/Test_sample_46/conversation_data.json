    "To solve this problem, we need to remove all numbers larger than -79.2 from the given list. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the List**: The list provided is `['-80.80', '49', '31.103', '54.4', '84.485', '-24.2341']`. These are string representations of numbers.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: To compare these values with -79.2, we need to convert them from strings to numbers. In this case, we will convert them to floating-point numbers.\n\n3. **Comparison**: We need to compare each number with -79.2. If a number is larger than -79.2, it should be removed from the list.\n\n4. **Create a New List**: We will create a new list that only includes numbers that are less than or equal to -79.2.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: Since the original list contains numbers as strings, we will convert the numbers in the new list back to strings.\n\n6. **Return the Result**: Finally, we will return the new list in the specified format.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- Convert each string in the list to a float:\n  - '-80.80' becomes -80.80\n  - '49' becomes 49.0\n  - '31.103' becomes 31.103\n  - '54.4' becomes 54.4\n  - '84.485' becomes 84.485\n  - '-24.2341' becomes -24.2341\n\n- Compare each number with -79.2:\n  - -80.80 is less than -79.2, so it remains in the list.\n  - 49.0 is greater than -79.2, so it is removed.\n  - 31.103 is greater than -79.2, so it is removed.\n  - 54.4 is greater than -79.2, so it is removed.\n  - 84.485 is greater than -79.2, so it is removed.\n  - -24.2341 is greater than -79.2, so it is removed.\n\n- The new list after filtering is `[-80.80]`.\n\n- Convert the numbers in the new list back to strings:\n  - -80.80 becomes '-80.80'\n\n- The final list in string format is `['-80.80']`.\n\nTherefore, the new list is:\n\n<<<['-80.80']>>>"
