    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the given list of numbers and keep only those numbers that are smaller than 9.3. Let's go through the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Requirement**: We need to create a new list from the given list of numbers, where each number in the new list is less than 9.3.\n\n2. **Identify the Numbers**: The given list of numbers is:\n   - '-21.212'\n   - '-26.1843'\n   - '-20'\n   - '10.018'\n   - '85.7081'\n   - '-89.1'\n   - '-66.0982'\n\n3. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: Since the numbers are given as strings, we need to convert them to floating-point numbers to perform numerical comparisons.\n\n4. **Filter the Numbers**: We will compare each number to 9.3 and keep only those that are smaller.\n\n5. **List the Numbers Smaller than 9.3**:\n   - '-21.212' (converted to -21.212) is less than 9.3.\n   - '-26.1843' (converted to -26.1843) is less than 9.3.\n   - '-20' (converted to -20.0) is less than 9.3.\n   - '10.018' (converted to 10.018) is not less than 9.3.\n   - '85.7081' (converted to 85.7081) is not less than 9.3.\n   - '-89.1' (converted to -89.1) is less than 9.3.\n   - '-66.0982' (converted to -66.0982) is less than 9.3.\n\n6. **Create the New List**: The numbers that are smaller than 9.3 are:\n   - '-21.212'\n   - '-26.1843'\n   - '-20'\n   - '-89.1'\n   - '-66.0982'\n\n7. **Format the Output**: The new list should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<['-21.212', '-26.1843', '-20', '-89.1', '-66.0982']>>>"
