    "To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the list of strings representing numbers and remove any numbers that are larger than -24. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List**: The given list is `['-31', '-35.3010', '2', '35.97']`.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: We need to convert each string in the list to a numerical value to compare them with -24. This involves:\n   - Converting each string to a float, as some numbers have decimal points.\n\n3. **Comparison with -24**: For each number, check if it is larger than -24. If it is, it should be removed from the list.\n\n4. **Filter the List**: Create a new list that only includes numbers that are not larger than -24.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: Convert the filtered numbers back to strings to match the original format.\n\n6. **Return the Result**: Format the new list within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- Convert each string to a float:\n  - '-31' becomes -31.0\n  - '-35.3010' becomes -35.3010\n  - '2' becomes 2.0\n  - '35.97' becomes 35.97\n\n- Compare each number with -24:\n  - -31.0 is not larger than -24\n  - -35.3010 is not larger than -24\n  - 2.0 is larger than -24\n  - 35.97 is larger than -24\n\n- Filter the list to include only numbers not larger than -24:\n  - The numbers -31.0 and -35.3010 remain.\n\n- Convert the filtered numbers back to strings:\n  - -31.0 becomes '-31'\n  - -35.3010 becomes '-35.3010'\n\n- Format the result within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<['-31', '-35.3010']>>>"
