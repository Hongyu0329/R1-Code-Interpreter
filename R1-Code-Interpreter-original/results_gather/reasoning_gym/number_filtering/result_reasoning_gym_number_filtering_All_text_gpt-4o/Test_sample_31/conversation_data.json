    "To solve this problem, we need to remove all numbers smaller than 42.7 from the given list of strings representing numbers. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input**: The input is a list of strings, each representing a number. The list is:\n   ```\n   ['-11.15', '-3', '-23', '-84.9', '-41.85', '68.5067', '-88.0', '-34.37', '20', '94.5472']\n   ```\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: Since the list contains strings, we need to convert these strings to numbers (floats) to perform numerical comparisons.\n\n3. **Comparison**: We need to compare each number to 42.7 and determine if it is smaller. If a number is smaller than 42.7, it should be removed from the list.\n\n4. **Create a New List**: We will create a new list that only includes numbers that are 42.7 or larger.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: Once we have the filtered list of numbers, we need to convert them back to strings to match the format of the original list.\n\n6. **Return the Result**: Finally, we will return the new list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- Convert each string in the list to a float.\n- Compare each float to 42.7.\n- Keep only those numbers that are 42.7 or larger.\n- Convert the filtered numbers back to strings.\n- Return the new list in the specified format.\n\nApplying these steps to the given list:\n\n- Convert to floats: `[-11.15, -3, -23, -84.9, -41.85, 68.5067, -88.0, -34.37, 20, 94.5472]`\n- Filter numbers: `[68.5067, 94.5472]` (only these are 42.7 or larger)\n- Convert back to strings: `['68.5067', '94.5472']`\n\nThe final list, enclosed within triple angle brackets, is:\n\n<<<['68.5067', '94.5472']>>>"
