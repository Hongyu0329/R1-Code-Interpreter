    "To solve this problem, we need to remove all numbers smaller than 93.34 from the given list. Let's break down the steps required to achieve this:\n\n1. **Understand the Input**: The input is a list of strings representing numbers: `['83', '-2.1732', '98.69', '66.622', '-0.2551', '50.86', '21.7205']`.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: Since the list contains strings, we need to convert these strings to floating-point numbers to perform numerical comparisons.\n\n3. **Comparison**: We need to compare each number to 93.34 and determine if it is smaller. If a number is smaller, it should be removed from the list.\n\n4. **Create a New List**: Construct a new list that only includes numbers that are greater than or equal to 93.34.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: Once we have the filtered list of numbers, convert them back to strings to match the format of the original list.\n\n6. **Format the Output**: The final list should be enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the new list>>>.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given list:\n\n- Convert each string to a float:\n  - '83' -> 83.0\n  - '-2.1732' -> -2.1732\n  - '98.69' -> 98.69\n  - '66.622' -> 66.622\n  - '-0.2551' -> -0.2551\n  - '50.86' -> 50.86\n  - '21.7205' -> 21.7205\n\n- Compare each number to 93.34:\n  - 83.0 < 93.34 (remove)\n  - -2.1732 < 93.34 (remove)\n  - 98.69 >= 93.34 (keep)\n  - 66.622 < 93.34 (remove)\n  - -0.2551 < 93.34 (remove)\n  - 50.86 < 93.34 (remove)\n  - 21.7205 < 93.34 (remove)\n\n- The only number that is greater than or equal to 93.34 is 98.69.\n\n- Convert the remaining number back to a string: 98.69 -> '98.69'\n\n- Format the output list: <<<['98.69']>>>\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<['98.69']>>>"
