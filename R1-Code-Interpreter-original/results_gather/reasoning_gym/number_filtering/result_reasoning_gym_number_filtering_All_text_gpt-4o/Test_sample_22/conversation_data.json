    "To solve the problem of removing all numbers smaller than 45 from the given list, we need to follow a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Input**: The input is a list of strings representing numbers. The list is: `['-12.21', '-3.396', '-23.922', '-33.986', '75.3']`.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: Since the list contains strings, we need to convert these strings to numbers (floats) to perform numerical comparisons.\n\n3. **Identify Numbers Smaller than 45**: We need to identify which numbers in the list are smaller than 45. This involves comparing each number to 45.\n\n4. **Filter the List**: Remove the numbers that are smaller than 45. Only keep numbers that are 45 or greater.\n\n5. **Convert Back to Strings**: After filtering, convert the remaining numbers back to strings to match the original format of the list.\n\n6. **Return the Result**: Format the resulting list of strings within triple angle brackets as specified.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given list:\n\n- Convert each string to a float:\n  - '-12.21' becomes -12.21\n  - '-3.396' becomes -3.396\n  - '-23.922' becomes -23.922\n  - '-33.986' becomes -33.986\n  - '75.3' becomes 75.3\n\n- Compare each number to 45:\n  - -12.21 is less than 45\n  - -3.396 is less than 45\n  - -23.922 is less than 45\n  - -33.986 is less than 45\n  - 75.3 is greater than 45\n\n- Filter the list to keep only numbers 45 or greater:\n  - The only number that meets this criterion is 75.3.\n\n- Convert the remaining number back to a string:\n  - 75.3 becomes '75.3'\n\n- Format the result within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<['75.3']>>>"
