    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the given list of numbers and keep only those that are larger than 35.6166. Let's go through the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Understand the List**: The list provided is `['-37.57', '-41', '-39', '21.5622', '93.58']`. These are string representations of numbers, and we need to compare them numerically.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: Before we can compare these values to 35.6166, we need to convert them from strings to floating-point numbers.\n\n3. **Comparison**: We will compare each number to 35.6166 and keep only those numbers that are greater than this value.\n\n4. **Create a New List**: We will create a new list that contains only the numbers that satisfy the condition.\n\n5. **Format the Output**: Finally, we will format the output list in the specified format using triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- Convert each string in the list to a float:\n  - '-37.57' becomes -37.57\n  - '-41' becomes -41.0\n  - '-39' becomes -39.0\n  - '21.5622' becomes 21.5622\n  - '93.58' becomes 93.58\n\n- Compare each number to 35.6166:\n  - -37.57 is not greater than 35.6166\n  - -41.0 is not greater than 35.6166\n  - -39.0 is not greater than 35.6166\n  - 21.5622 is not greater than 35.6166\n  - 93.58 is greater than 35.6166\n\n- The only number greater than 35.6166 is 93.58.\n\n- Create a new list with this number: `[93.58]`\n\n- Format the output: `<<<[93.58]>>>`\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[93.58]>>>"
