    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the given list of numbers and keep only those that are smaller than -34.7. Let's go through the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Identify the List**: The list provided is `['-61', '7.47', '50.8608', '98.29', '37.463', '-87.6494', '-71']`.\n\n2. **Understand the Condition**: We need to keep numbers that are smaller than -34.7.\n\n3. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: The list contains numbers as strings, so we need to convert them to floating-point numbers to perform the comparison.\n\n4. **Filter the List**: We will iterate through the list, convert each string to a float, and check if it is smaller than -34.7. If it is, we will keep it in the new list.\n\n5. **Create the New List**: After filtering, we will have a new list containing only the numbers that meet the condition.\n\n6. **Format the Output**: The final output should be in the same format as the input list, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- Convert each string in the list to a float:\n  - '-61' -> -61.0\n  - '7.47' -> 7.47\n  - '50.8608' -> 50.8608\n  - '98.29' -> 98.29\n  - '37.463' -> 37.463\n  - '-87.6494' -> -87.6494\n  - '-71' -> -71.0\n\n- Compare each number to -34.7:\n  - -61.0 < -34.7 (True)\n  - 7.47 < -34.7 (False)\n  - 50.8608 < -34.7 (False)\n  - 98.29 < -34.7 (False)\n  - 37.463 < -34.7 (False)\n  - -87.6494 < -34.7 (True)\n  - -71.0 < -34.7 (True)\n\n- Keep only the numbers that are smaller than -34.7:\n  - -61.0, -87.6494, -71.0\n\n- Convert these numbers back to strings to match the original format:\n  - '-61', '-87.6494', '-71'\n\n- Enclose the new list within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<['-61', '-87.6494', '-71']>>>"
