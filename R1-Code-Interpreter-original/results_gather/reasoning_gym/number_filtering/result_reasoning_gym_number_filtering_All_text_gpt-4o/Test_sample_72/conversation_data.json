    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given list and filter out numbers based on the condition that they must be larger than 66. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the List**: The list provided is `['74.4', '-22', '43']`. It contains three elements, all of which are strings representing numbers.\n\n2. **Convert Strings to Numbers**: To compare these values with 66, we need to convert them from strings to numbers. The elements are:\n   - `'74.4'` can be converted to the float `74.4`.\n   - `'-22'` can be converted to the integer `-22`.\n   - `'43'` can be converted to the integer `43`.\n\n3. **Apply the Condition**: We need to keep only those numbers that are larger than 66.\n   - `74.4` is larger than 66.\n   - `-22` is not larger than 66.\n   - `43` is not larger than 66.\n\n4. **Create the New List**: Based on the condition, the only number that satisfies the requirement is `74.4`.\n\n5. **Convert Back to String**: Since the original list was composed of strings, we should convert the number back to a string for consistency.\n   - `74.4` as a string is `'74.4'`.\n\n6. **Format the Output**: The final list should be enclosed within triple angle brackets as specified.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the final answer:\n\n<<<['74.4']>>>"
