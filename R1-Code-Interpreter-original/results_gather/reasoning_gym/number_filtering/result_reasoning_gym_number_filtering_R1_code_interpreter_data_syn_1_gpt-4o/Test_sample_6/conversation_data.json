    "To solve this problem, we need to filter out all numbers from the list that are larger than -71.160. The list contains string representations of numbers, so we need to convert them to floats for comparison. After filtering, we will convert the numbers back to strings to match the original format.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Convert each string in the list to a float.\n2. Filter out numbers that are larger than -71.160.\n3. Convert the remaining numbers back to strings.\n4. Return the new list in the specified format.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Original list of numbers as strings\nnumbers = ['-14', '-86.754', '-25.0137', '33.0071', '-31.09', '42.0210', '45.319', '98.0809', '-19.8521']\n\n# Convert strings to floats and filter out numbers larger than -71.160\nfiltered_numbers = [num for num in numbers if float(num) <= -71.160]\n\n# Print the filtered list\nprint(filtered_numbers)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the filtered list.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the filtered list containing only the numbers that are less than or equal to -71.160. The list is `['-86.754']`.\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<['-86.754']>>>"
