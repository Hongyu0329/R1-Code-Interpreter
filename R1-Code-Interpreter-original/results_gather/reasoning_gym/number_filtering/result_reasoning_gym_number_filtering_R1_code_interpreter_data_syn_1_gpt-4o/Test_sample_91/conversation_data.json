    "To solve this problem, we need to filter out numbers from the list that are larger than -39. The list contains strings representing numbers, so we need to convert these strings to floats, perform the comparison, and then convert the filtered numbers back to strings.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Convert each string in the list to a float.\n2. Filter out numbers that are greater than -39.\n3. Convert the filtered numbers back to strings.\n4. Return the new list in the specified format.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these steps:\n\n```python\n# Original list of strings\noriginal_list = ['-46.465', '-47', '-24.1751']\n\n# Convert strings to floats, filter, and convert back to strings\nfiltered_list = [str(num) for num in map(float, original_list) if num > -39]\n\n# Print the filtered list\nprint(filtered_list)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to get the filtered list.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the filtered list containing numbers larger than -39. The list `['-24.1751']` is the result after filtering.\n\nNow, let's format the final answer as requested:\n\n<<<['-24.1751']>>>"
