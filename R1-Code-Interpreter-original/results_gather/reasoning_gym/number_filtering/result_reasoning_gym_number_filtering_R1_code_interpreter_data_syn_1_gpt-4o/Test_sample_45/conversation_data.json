    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the list of strings representing numbers and keep only those numbers that are smaller than -65.1. The steps involved are:\n\n1. Convert each string in the list to a float.\n2. Compare each float to -65.1.\n3. Keep only those numbers that are smaller than -65.1.\n4. Convert the filtered numbers back to strings.\n5. Return the new list in the specified format.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these steps:\n\n```python\n# Original list of numbers as strings\nnumbers = ['-34.8', '-61', '-41.5350', '99.9', '-70.9057', '-99.51', '-94.330']\n\n# Convert strings to floats, filter, and convert back to strings\nfiltered_numbers = [num for num in numbers if float(num) < -65.1]\n\n# Print the filtered list\nprint(filtered_numbers)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the filtered list.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the filtered list of numbers that are smaller than -65.1. Now, I will provide the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<['-70.9057', '-99.51', '-94.330']>>>"
