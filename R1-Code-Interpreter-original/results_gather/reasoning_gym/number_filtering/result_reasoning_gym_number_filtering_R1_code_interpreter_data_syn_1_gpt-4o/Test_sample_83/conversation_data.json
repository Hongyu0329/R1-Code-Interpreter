    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the list of strings based on their numeric values. Specifically, we want to keep only those numbers that are smaller than -34.7. \n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Convert each string in the list to a float.\n2. Compare each float to -34.7.\n3. Keep only those numbers that are smaller than -34.7.\n4. Convert the filtered numbers back to strings to maintain the original format.\n5. Return the new list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these steps:\n\n```python\n# Original list of strings\nnumbers = ['-61', '7.47', '50.8608', '98.29', '37.463', '-87.6494', '-71']\n\n# Convert strings to floats, filter, and convert back to strings\nfiltered_numbers = [num for num in numbers if float(num) < -34.7]\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{filtered_numbers}>>>\")\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to get the desired output.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the filtered list of numbers that are smaller than -34.7. The output is in the correct format as requested.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<['-61', '-87.6494', '-71']>>>"
