    "To solve this problem, we need to filter out numbers from the given list that are smaller than 84. The list contains strings representing numbers, so we need to convert these strings to floats, perform the comparison, and then convert the filtered numbers back to strings to maintain the original format.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Convert each string in the list to a float.\n2. Filter out numbers that are smaller than 84.\n3. Convert the filtered numbers back to strings.\n4. Return the new list in the specified format.\n\nLet's write the Python code to achieve this:\n\n```python\n# Original list of numbers as strings\nnumbers = ['-75.18', '-40', '37.46', '90.406', '19.02']\n\n# Convert strings to floats, filter, and convert back to strings\nfiltered_numbers = [num for num in numbers if float(num) < 84]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(filtered_numbers)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the filtered list.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the filtered list of numbers that are smaller than 84. Now, I will provide the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<['-75.18', '-40', '37.46', '19.02']>>>"
