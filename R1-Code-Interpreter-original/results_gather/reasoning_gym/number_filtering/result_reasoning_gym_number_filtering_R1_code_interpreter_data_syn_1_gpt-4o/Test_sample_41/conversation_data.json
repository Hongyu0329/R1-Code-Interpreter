    "To solve this problem, we need to filter out all numbers from the given list that are smaller than -40.2034. The list contains string representations of numbers, so we need to convert these strings to floats for comparison. After filtering, we will convert the numbers back to strings to maintain the original format.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Convert each string in the list to a float.\n2. Filter out numbers that are smaller than -40.2034.\n3. Convert the remaining numbers back to strings.\n4. Return the new list in the specified format.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Original list of numbers as strings\nnumbers = ['-75.558', '12.830', '-40', '-2.5532', '0.101', '-77.92', '-18']\n\n# Threshold for filtering\nthreshold = -40.2034\n\n# Convert strings to floats, filter, and convert back to strings\nfiltered_numbers = [num for num in numbers if float(num) >= threshold]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(filtered_numbers)\n```\n\nThis code will filter the list and print the new list of numbers that are not smaller than -40.2034.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the filtered list of numbers that are not smaller than -40.2034. The numbers have been retained in their original string format.\n\nThe final answer, as requested, is:\n\n<<<['12.830', '-40', '-2.5532', '0.101', '-18']>>>"
