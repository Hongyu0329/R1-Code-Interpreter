    "To solve this problem, we need to filter out the numbers from the given list that are smaller than -30. The list contains strings, so we need to convert these strings to floats to perform the comparison. After filtering, we will convert the numbers back to strings to match the original format.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n1. Convert each string in the list to a float.\n2. Filter the numbers that are smaller than -30.\n3. Convert the filtered numbers back to strings.\n4. Return the new list in the specified format.\n\nLet's write the Python code to achieve this:\n\n```python\n# Original list of strings\noriginal_list = ['-43.3', '-46.876', '-6.56', '95', '58', '33.2', '-69']\n\n# Convert strings to floats and filter numbers smaller than -30\nfiltered_list = [str(num) for num in map(float, original_list) if num < -30]\n\n# Print the filtered list\nprint(filtered_list)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the filtered list.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the filtered list of numbers smaller than -30. The numbers were converted back to strings to match the original format.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<['-43.3', '-46.876', '-69.0']>>>"
