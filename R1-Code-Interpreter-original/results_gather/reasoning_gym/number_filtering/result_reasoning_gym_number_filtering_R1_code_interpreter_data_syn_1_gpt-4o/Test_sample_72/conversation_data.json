    "To solve this problem, we need to filter out numbers from the given list that are greater than 66. The list contains strings, so we need to convert these strings to numbers (floats or integers) to perform the comparison. After filtering, we will convert the numbers back to strings to maintain the original format.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Convert each string in the list to a float.\n2. Filter out numbers that are greater than 66.\n3. Convert the filtered numbers back to strings.\n4. Return the new list in the specified format.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Original list of strings\noriginal_list = ['74.4', '-22', '43']\n\n# Convert strings to floats and filter numbers greater than 66\nfiltered_list = [str(num) for num in map(float, original_list) if num > 66]\n\n# Print the filtered list\nprint(filtered_list)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the filtered list containing only the numbers greater than 66. The list is in the same format as the original, with numbers represented as strings.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<['74.4']>>>"
