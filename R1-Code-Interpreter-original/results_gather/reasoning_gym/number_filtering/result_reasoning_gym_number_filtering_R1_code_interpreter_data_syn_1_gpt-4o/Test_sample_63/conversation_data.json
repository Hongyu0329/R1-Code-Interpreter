    "To solve this problem, we need to filter out numbers from the list that are smaller than 26. The list contains strings, so we need to convert these strings to numbers (either integers or floats) to perform the comparison. After filtering, we will convert the numbers back to strings to maintain the original format of the list.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Convert each string in the list to a float for comparison.\n2. Filter out numbers that are smaller than 26.\n3. Convert the remaining numbers back to strings.\n4. Return the new list in the specified format.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Original list of strings\noriginal_list = ['89', '-72', '20.23', '61', '13.6020']\n\n# Convert strings to floats, filter, and convert back to strings\nfiltered_list = [str(num) for num in map(float, original_list) if num >= 26]\n\n# Print the filtered list\nprint(filtered_list)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the filtered list.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the filtered list of numbers that are greater than or equal to 26. The numbers have been converted back to strings, but they are represented as floats with a decimal point. To match the original format more closely, we can convert them to integers if they don't have a fractional part.\n\nLet's refine the code to ensure that numbers without a fractional part are represented as integers in string format:\n\n```python\n# Original list of strings\noriginal_list = ['89', '-72', '20.23', '61', '13.6020']\n\n# Convert strings to floats, filter, and convert back to strings\nfiltered_list = [str(int(num)) if num.is_integer() else str(num) for num in map(float, original_list) if num >= 26]\n\n# Print the filtered list\nprint(filtered_list)\n```\n\nLet's execute this refined code.",
    "The refined code executed successfully, and the output is the filtered list of numbers greater than or equal to 26, formatted as strings. The numbers without fractional parts are now represented as integers in string format, which matches the original list's style more closely.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<['89', '61']>>>"
