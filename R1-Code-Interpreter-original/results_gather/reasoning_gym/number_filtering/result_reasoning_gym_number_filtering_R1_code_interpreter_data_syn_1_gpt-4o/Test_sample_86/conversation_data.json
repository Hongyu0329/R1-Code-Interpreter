    "To solve this problem, we need to filter out the numbers from the given list that are greater than 35.6166. The list contains string representations of numbers, so we will need to convert these strings to floats for comparison. After filtering, we will convert the numbers back to strings to match the original format.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n1. Convert each string in the list to a float.\n2. Filter out the numbers that are greater than 35.6166.\n3. Convert the filtered numbers back to strings.\n4. Return the new list in the specified format.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Original list of numbers as strings\nnumbers = ['-37.57', '-41', '-39', '21.5622', '93.58']\n\n# Convert strings to floats and filter numbers greater than 35.6166\nfiltered_numbers = [num for num in numbers if float(num) > 35.6166]\n\n# Print the filtered list\nprint(filtered_numbers)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the filtered list.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is `['93.58']`. This means that the only number in the list that is greater than 35.6166 is `93.58`.\n\nTherefore, the new list containing only numbers larger than 35.6166 is:\n\n<<<['93.58']>>>"
