    "To solve this problem, we need to filter out the numbers from the given list that are greater than 70.1. The list contains string representations of numbers, so we will first convert these strings to floats, perform the filtering, and then convert the filtered numbers back to strings to maintain the original format.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Convert each string in the list to a float.\n2. Filter the list to keep only those numbers that are greater than 70.1.\n3. Convert the filtered numbers back to strings.\n4. Return the new list in the specified format.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Original list of numbers as strings\nnumbers = ['23.962', '-3.50', '91.391', '100', '-49.9769', '-93.05']\n\n# Convert strings to floats and filter numbers greater than 70.1\nfiltered_numbers = [num for num in numbers if float(num) > 70.1]\n\n# Print the filtered list\nprint(filtered_numbers)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the filtered list.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the filtered list of numbers that are greater than 70.1. The numbers '91.391' and '100' meet the criteria and are included in the new list.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<['91.391', '100']>>>"
