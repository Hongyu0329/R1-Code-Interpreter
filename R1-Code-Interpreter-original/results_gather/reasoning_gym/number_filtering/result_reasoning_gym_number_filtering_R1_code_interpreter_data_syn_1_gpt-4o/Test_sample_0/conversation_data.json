    "To solve this problem, we need to filter out numbers from the list that are smaller than -25. The list contains strings representing floating-point numbers, so we need to convert these strings to floats, perform the filtering, and then convert the filtered numbers back to strings.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Convert each string in the list to a float.\n2. Filter out numbers that are smaller than -25.\n3. Convert the remaining numbers back to strings.\n4. Return the new list in the specified format.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these steps:\n\n```python\n# Original list of strings\noriginal_list = ['85.3', '-39.4', '-1', '-79.9529']\n\n# Convert strings to floats and filter out numbers smaller than -25\nfiltered_list = [str(num) for num in map(float, original_list) if num >= -25]\n\n# Print the filtered list\nprint(filtered_list)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to get the filtered list.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the filtered list of numbers that are not smaller than -25. The numbers have been converted back to strings as required.\n\nThe final answer, with the new list in the specified format, is:\n\n<<<['85.3', '-1.0']>>>"
