    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the list of strings representing numbers and keep only those numbers that are smaller than -75.911. The steps involved are:\n\n1. Convert the list of string numbers to a list of floats.\n2. Filter the list to keep only the numbers that are smaller than -75.911.\n3. Convert the filtered list of floats back to strings.\n4. Return the new list in the specified format.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Original list of string numbers\nnumbers = ['-26.4496', '-96.1378', '-35.756']\n\n# Convert strings to floats and filter\nfiltered_numbers = [num for num in numbers if float(num) < -75.911]\n\n# Print the filtered list\nprint(filtered_numbers)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the filtered list.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the filtered list of numbers that are smaller than -75.911. Now, I will provide the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<['-96.1378']>>>"
