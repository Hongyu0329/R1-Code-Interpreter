    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the list of strings representing numbers and keep only those numbers that are smaller than -25.866. \n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Convert each string in the list to a float.\n2. Compare each float to -25.866.\n3. Keep only those numbers that are smaller than -25.866.\n4. Convert the filtered numbers back to strings to maintain the original format.\n5. Return the new list in the specified format.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these steps:\n\n```python\n# Original list of numbers as strings\nnumbers = ['50.11', '73.01', '-13.65', '13.3480', '50.98', '30.5795', '86', '-27.1419']\n\n# Convert strings to floats and filter based on the condition\nfiltered_numbers = [num for num in numbers if float(num) < -25.866]\n\n# Print the filtered list\nprint(filtered_numbers)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the filtered list.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the filtered list containing only the numbers smaller than -25.866. \n\nThe final answer, formatted as requested, is:\n\n<<<['-27.1419']>>>"
