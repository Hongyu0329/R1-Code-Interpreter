    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the list of strings representing numbers and keep only those numbers that are smaller than -37.8206. \n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Convert each string in the list to a float to perform numerical comparisons.\n2. Filter the list to keep only those numbers that are less than -37.8206.\n3. Convert the filtered numbers back to strings to maintain the original format.\n4. Return the new list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's write the Python code to achieve this:\n\n```python\n# Original list of numbers as strings\nnumbers = ['-7.348', '-59.99', '-89.4', '-43.674', '-2', '-33.07', '-54.5153', '-87.918']\n\n# Threshold value\nthreshold = -37.8206\n\n# Filter the list\nfiltered_numbers = [num for num in numbers if float(num) < threshold]\n\n# Print the filtered list\nprint(filtered_numbers)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to get the filtered list.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the filtered list of numbers that are smaller than -37.8206. Now, I will provide the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<['-59.99', '-89.4', '-43.674', '-54.5153', '-87.918']>>>"
