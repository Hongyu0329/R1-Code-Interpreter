    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the list and keep only the numbers that are smaller than -36. The list contains strings, so we need to convert these strings to floats to perform the comparison. After filtering, we will convert the numbers back to strings to maintain the original format.\n\nLet's write a Python script to achieve this:\n\n```python\n# Original list of numbers as strings\nnumbers = ['47.5830', '-79.56', '28.94', '76', '79']\n\n# Convert strings to floats, filter, and convert back to strings\nfiltered_numbers = [num for num in numbers if float(num) < -36]\n\n# Print the filtered list\nprint(filtered_numbers)\n```\n\nThis script will filter the list and keep only the numbers smaller than -36. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and filtered the list to include only the numbers smaller than -36. The result is a list containing the string '-79.56'.\n\nNow, I will provide the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<['-79.56']>>>"
