    "To solve this problem, we need to filter out numbers from the given list that are larger than 42.255. The list contains strings, so we need to convert these strings to floats for comparison. After filtering, we will convert the numbers back to strings to maintain the original format.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Convert each string in the list to a float.\n2. Compare each float to 42.255.\n3. Keep only those numbers that are greater than 42.255.\n4. Convert the filtered numbers back to strings.\n5. Return the new list in the specified format.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python code.\n\n```python\n# Original list of strings\noriginal_list = ['11.24', '49', '41.54']\n\n# Convert strings to floats and filter\nfiltered_list = [num for num in original_list if float(num) > 42.255]\n\n# Print the filtered list\nprint(filtered_list)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the filtered list.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the filtered list. The only number in the list that is greater than 42.255 is '49'. Therefore, the new list containing numbers larger than 42.255 is:\n\n<<<['49']>>>"
