    "To solve this problem, we need to filter out the numbers from the given list that are larger than -71.248. The list contains string representations of numbers, so we will need to convert these strings to floats for comparison. After filtering, we will convert the numbers back to strings to match the original format.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these steps:\n\n1. Convert each string in the list to a float.\n2. Filter out the numbers that are larger than -71.248.\n3. Convert the filtered numbers back to strings.\n4. Return the new list in the specified format.\n\nHere's the Python code to achieve this:\n\n```python\n# Original list of numbers as strings\nnumbers = ['-73.6217', '-39.5500', '-61.456', '-67', '-1.4', '-56.3901', '11.3127', '-69.0']\n\n# Convert strings to floats and filter numbers larger than -71.248\nfiltered_numbers = [num for num in numbers if float(num) > -71.248]\n\n# Print the filtered list\nprint(filtered_numbers)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to get the filtered list.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the filtered list of numbers that are larger than -71.248. The numbers are still in their string format, as required.\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer in the specified format:\n\n<<<['-39.5500', '-61.456', '-67', '-1.4', '-56.3901', '11.3127', '-69.0']>>>"
