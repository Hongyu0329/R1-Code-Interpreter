    "To solve this problem, we need to filter out numbers from the given list that are greater than 19.8962. The list contains strings, so we need to convert these strings to floats for comparison. After filtering, we will convert the numbers back to strings to maintain the original format.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n1. Convert each string in the list to a float.\n2. Filter out numbers that are greater than 19.8962.\n3. Convert the filtered numbers back to strings.\n4. Return the new list in the specified format.\n\nLet's write the Python code to perform these steps:\n\n```python\n# Original list of strings\noriginal_list = ['4', '-64.7', '-42.1', '-77', '-79.9640', '37.76', '38.702', '18.20', '-28.34']\n\n# Convert strings to floats and filter numbers greater than 19.8962\nfiltered_list = [str(num) for num in map(float, original_list) if num > 19.8962]\n\n# Print the filtered list\nprint(filtered_list)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the filtered list.",
    "The code executed successfully and filtered the list to include only numbers greater than 19.8962. The filtered list is `['37.76', '38.702']`.\n\nNow, I will provide the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<['37.76', '38.702']>>>"
