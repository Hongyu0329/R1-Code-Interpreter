    "To solve this problem, we need to filter out the numbers from the given list that are smaller than -10.1. The list contains strings, so we need to convert these strings to floats for comparison. After filtering, we will convert the numbers back to strings to maintain the original format.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n1. Convert each string in the list to a float.\n2. Filter the numbers that are smaller than -10.1.\n3. Convert the filtered numbers back to strings.\n4. Return the new list in the specified format.\n\nLet's write the Python code to perform these steps:\n\n```python\n# Original list of strings\noriginal_list = ['-8.1', '41.10', '-13', '7', '47.34']\n\n# Convert strings to floats and filter numbers smaller than -10.1\nfiltered_list = [str(num) for num in map(float, original_list) if num < -10.1]\n\n# Print the filtered list\nprint(filtered_list)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the filtered list.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the filtered list containing numbers smaller than -10.1. The number -13 was the only one meeting this criterion, and it was converted back to a string format.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<['-13.0']>>>"
