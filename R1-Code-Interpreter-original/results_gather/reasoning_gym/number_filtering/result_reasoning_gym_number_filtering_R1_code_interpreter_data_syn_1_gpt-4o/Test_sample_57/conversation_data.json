    "To solve this problem, we need to filter out the numbers from the list that are larger than -34.37. The list contains strings, so we need to convert them to floats for comparison. After filtering, we will convert the numbers back to strings to maintain the original format.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these steps:\n\n1. Convert each string in the list to a float.\n2. Filter out the numbers that are greater than -34.37.\n3. Convert the filtered numbers back to strings.\n4. Return the new list in the specified format.\n\nHere is the Python code to achieve this:\n\n```python\n# Original list of numbers as strings\nnumbers = ['53.57', '-72', '-70.085', '-33.1']\n\n# Convert strings to floats and filter numbers greater than -34.37\nfiltered_numbers = [num for num in numbers if float(num) > -34.37]\n\n# Print the filtered list\nprint(filtered_numbers)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the filtered list.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the filtered list of numbers that are greater than -34.37. The numbers are kept in their original string format as required.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<['53.57', '-33.1']>>>"
