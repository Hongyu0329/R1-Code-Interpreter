    "To solve this problem, we need to filter out numbers larger than 22.0 from the given list of strings. The steps involved are:\n\n1. Convert each string in the list to a float.\n2. Filter out numbers that are greater than 22.0.\n3. Convert the filtered numbers back to strings to maintain the original format.\n4. Return the new list.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these steps:\n\n```python\n# Original list of strings\noriginal_list = ['-23.8495', '-64.2', '-73', '-49.770', '6.1625', '-82.0327', '-2.145', '44.4451', '-56.66']\n\n# Convert strings to floats and filter out numbers greater than 22.0\nfiltered_list = [str(num) for num in map(float, original_list) if num <= 22.0]\n\n# Print the filtered list\nprint(filtered_list)\n```\n\nThis script will convert the strings to floats, filter out the numbers greater than 22.0, and then convert the remaining numbers back to strings. Let's execute this code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the filtered list with all numbers larger than 22.0 removed. The list is returned in the same format as the original, with each number represented as a string.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<['-23.8495', '-64.2', '-73.0', '-49.77', '6.1625', '-82.0327', '-2.145', '-56.66']>>>"
