    "To solve this problem, we need to filter out numbers from the given list that are greater than 85.2175. The list contains string representations of numbers, so we need to convert them to floats for comparison. After filtering, we will convert the numbers back to strings to match the original format.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n1. Convert each string in the list to a float.\n2. Filter out numbers that are greater than 85.2175.\n3. Convert the filtered numbers back to strings.\n4. Return the new list in the specified format.\n\nLet's write the Python code to perform these steps:\n\n```python\n# Original list of numbers as strings\nnumbers = ['-25.5101', '-82.48', '-97', '-30.3814', '93.1', '-55.5701', '36.583', '95.5']\n\n# Convert strings to floats and filter numbers greater than 85.2175\nfiltered_numbers = [num for num in numbers if float(num) > 85.2175]\n\n# Print the filtered list\nprint(filtered_numbers)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the filtered list.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the filtered list of numbers that are greater than 85.2175. Now, I will provide the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<['93.1', '95.5']>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
