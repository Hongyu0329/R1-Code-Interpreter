    "To solve this problem, we need to filter out the numbers from the given list that are larger than -18.58. The list contains strings, so we need to convert these strings to floats for comparison. After filtering, we will convert the numbers back to strings to maintain the original format.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these steps:\n\n1. Convert each string in the list to a float.\n2. Filter out the numbers that are greater than -18.58.\n3. Convert the filtered numbers back to strings.\n4. Return the new list.\n\nHere's the Python code to achieve this:\n\n```python\n# Original list of strings\noriginal_list = ['-20.0011', '17.4', '26.9', '17']\n\n# Convert strings to floats and filter\nfiltered_list = [str(num) for num in map(float, original_list) if num > -18.58]\n\n# Print the filtered list\nprint(filtered_list)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the filtered list.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the filtered list of numbers that are greater than -18.58. The numbers have been converted back to strings, and the list is in the desired format.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<['17.4', '26.9', '17.0']>>>"
