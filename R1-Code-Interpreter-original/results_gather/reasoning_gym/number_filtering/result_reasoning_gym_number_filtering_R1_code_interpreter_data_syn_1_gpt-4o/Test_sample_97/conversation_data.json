    "To solve this problem, we need to filter out all numbers from the list that are larger than 39.4. The list contains string representations of numbers, so we need to convert these strings to floats to perform the comparison. After filtering, we will convert the numbers back to strings to maintain the original format.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n1. Convert each string in the list to a float.\n2. Filter out numbers greater than 39.4.\n3. Convert the remaining numbers back to strings.\n4. Return the new list in the specified format.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Original list of strings\noriginal_list = ['-90.765', '26.17', '73.1', '-77.6256', '-69.37', '13.2', '-3.7093']\n\n# Convert strings to floats and filter out numbers greater than 39.4\nfiltered_list = [num for num in original_list if float(num) <= 39.4]\n\n# Print the filtered list\nprint(filtered_list)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the filtered list.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the filtered list with all numbers greater than 39.4 removed. The list is already in the desired format, with each number represented as a string.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<['-90.765', '26.17', '-77.6256', '-69.37', '13.2', '-3.7093']>>>"
