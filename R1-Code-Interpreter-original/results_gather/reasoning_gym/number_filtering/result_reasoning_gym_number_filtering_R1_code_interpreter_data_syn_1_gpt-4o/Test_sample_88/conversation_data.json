    "To solve this problem, we need to filter out numbers from the given list that are smaller than 9.87. The list contains strings representing numbers, so we need to convert these strings to floats for comparison. After filtering, we will convert the numbers back to strings to maintain the original format.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Convert each string in the list to a float.\n2. Filter out numbers that are smaller than 9.87.\n3. Convert the filtered numbers back to strings.\n4. Return the new list in the specified format.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Original list of strings\noriginal_list = ['-62.2704', '34.189', '-81.8', '-55.37', '44.58', '48']\n\n# Convert strings to floats and filter numbers smaller than 9.87\nfiltered_list = [num for num in original_list if float(num) < 9.87]\n\n# Print the filtered list\nprint(filtered_list)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the filtered list.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the filtered list of numbers that are smaller than 9.87. The numbers are returned in their original string format.\n\nThe final answer, as requested, is:\n\n<<<['-62.2704', '-81.8', '-55.37']>>>"
