    "To solve this problem, we need to filter out numbers from the list that are larger than -38.932. The list contains string representations of numbers, so we need to convert them to floats for comparison. After filtering, we will convert the numbers back to strings to maintain the original format.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n1. Convert each string in the list to a float.\n2. Compare each float to -38.932 and filter out those that are larger.\n3. Convert the remaining floats back to strings.\n4. Return the new list in the specified format.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Original list of numbers as strings\nnumbers = ['-56.370', '25.1', '22.8962', '-64.54']\n\n# Convert strings to floats and filter out numbers larger than -38.932\nfiltered_numbers = [num for num in numbers if float(num) <= -38.932]\n\n# Print the filtered list\nprint(filtered_numbers)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the filtered list.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the filtered list. The numbers that are less than or equal to -38.932 are retained in the list. \n\nThe final answer, with the filtered list in the required format, is:\n\n<<<['-56.370', '-64.54']>>>"
