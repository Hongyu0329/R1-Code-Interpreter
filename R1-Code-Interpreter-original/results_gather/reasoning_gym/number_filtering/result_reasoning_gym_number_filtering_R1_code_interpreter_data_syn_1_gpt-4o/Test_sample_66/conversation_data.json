    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the list of strings and keep only those numbers that are smaller than 46.60. The steps involved are:\n\n1. Convert each string in the list to a float.\n2. Compare each float to 46.60.\n3. Keep only those numbers that are smaller than 46.60.\n4. Convert the filtered numbers back to strings.\n5. Return the new list in the specified format.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these steps:\n\n```python\n# Original list of strings\noriginal_list = ['15', '-30', '94.39', '45.6363', '-87.069', '82.027', '-93.09', '-99']\n\n# Convert strings to floats and filter based on the condition\nfiltered_list = [num for num in original_list if float(num) < 46.60]\n\n# Print the filtered list\nprint(filtered_list)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the filtered list.",
    "The code executed successfully, and we have obtained the filtered list of numbers that are smaller than 46.60. The list is already in the required format, with each number as a string.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<['15', '-30', '45.6363', '-87.069', '-93.09', '-99']>>>"
