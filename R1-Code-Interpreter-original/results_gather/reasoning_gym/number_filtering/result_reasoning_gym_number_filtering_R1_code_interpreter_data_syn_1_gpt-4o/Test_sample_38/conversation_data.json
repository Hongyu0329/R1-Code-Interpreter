    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the list of strings representing numbers and keep only those numbers that are smaller than -10.831. The steps involved are:\n\n1. Convert each string in the list to a float.\n2. Compare each float to -10.831.\n3. Keep only those numbers that are smaller than -10.831.\n4. Convert the filtered numbers back to strings.\n5. Return the new list in the specified format.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these steps:\n\n```python\n# Original list of numbers as strings\nnumbers = ['-41.184', '-9.99', '99.0', '63.9635']\n\n# Convert strings to floats and filter based on the condition\nfiltered_numbers = [num for num in numbers if float(num) < -10.831]\n\n# Print the filtered list\nprint(filtered_numbers)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to get the filtered list.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the filtered list containing only the numbers smaller than -10.831. \n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<['-41.184']>>>"
