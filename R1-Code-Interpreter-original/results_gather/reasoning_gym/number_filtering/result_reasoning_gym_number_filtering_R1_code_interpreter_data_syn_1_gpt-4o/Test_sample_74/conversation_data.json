    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the list of strings representing numbers and keep only those numbers that are smaller than -45.173. The steps involved are:\n\n1. Convert each string in the list to a float.\n2. Compare each float to -45.173.\n3. Keep only those numbers that are smaller than -45.173.\n4. Convert the filtered numbers back to strings.\n5. Return the new list in the specified format.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these steps:\n\n```python\n# Original list of numbers as strings\nnumbers = ['-96.6473', '64', '90.66', '60.9', '61.943', '-27.213', '48.07', '38.041', '-44.375', '29.7']\n\n# Convert strings to floats and filter based on the condition\nfiltered_numbers = [num for num in numbers if float(num) < -45.173]\n\n# Print the filtered list\nprint(filtered_numbers)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the filtered list.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the filtered list containing only the numbers smaller than -45.173. Now, I will provide the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<['-96.6473']>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Keep all numbers smaller than -45.173 in this list: ['-96.6473', '64', '90.66', '60.9', '61.943', '-27.213', '48.07', '38.041', '-44.375', '29.7']\nReturn the new list in the same format enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the new list>>>.",
