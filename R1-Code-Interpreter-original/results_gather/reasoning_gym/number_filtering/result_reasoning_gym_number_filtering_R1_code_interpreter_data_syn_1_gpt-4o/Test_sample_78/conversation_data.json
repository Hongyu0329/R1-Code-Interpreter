    "To solve this problem, we need to filter out all numbers from the given list that are smaller than 56.3. The list contains strings representing numbers, so we need to convert these strings to floats for comparison. After filtering, we will convert the numbers back to strings to maintain the original format.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Convert each string in the list to a float.\n2. Filter out numbers that are smaller than 56.3.\n3. Convert the remaining numbers back to strings.\n4. Return the new list in the specified format.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Original list of numbers as strings\nnumbers = ['58.9297', '-50.447', '42.7027', '37.7693', '-16.65', '49', '63', '-70', '5.731']\n\n# Convert strings to floats and filter out numbers smaller than 56.3\nfiltered_numbers = [num for num in numbers if float(num) >= 56.3]\n\n# Print the filtered list\nprint(filtered_numbers)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the filtered list.",
    "The code executed successfully and filtered out the numbers smaller than 56.3. The resulting list contains only the numbers that are greater than or equal to 56.3, and they are still in string format as required.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<['58.9297', '63']>>>"
