    "To solve this problem, we need to filter out numbers from the given list that are smaller than 9.3. The list contains string representations of numbers, so we need to convert these strings to floats for comparison. After filtering, we will convert the numbers back to strings to maintain the original format.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n1. Convert each string in the list to a float.\n2. Filter out numbers that are smaller than 9.3.\n3. Convert the filtered numbers back to strings.\n4. Return the new list in the specified format.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Original list of numbers as strings\nnumbers = ['-21.212', '-26.1843', '-20', '10.018', '85.7081', '-89.1', '-66.0982']\n\n# Convert strings to floats, filter, and convert back to strings\nfiltered_numbers = [num for num in numbers if float(num) < 9.3]\n\n# Print the filtered list\nprint(filtered_numbers)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to get the filtered list.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the filtered list of numbers that are smaller than 9.3. Now, I will provide the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<['-21.212', '-26.1843', '-20', '-89.1', '-66.0982']>>>"
