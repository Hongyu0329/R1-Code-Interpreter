    "To solve this problem, we need to filter out the numbers from the given list that are greater than 34.39. The list contains strings, so we need to convert these strings to floats for comparison. After filtering, we will convert the numbers back to strings to maintain the original format.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Convert each string in the list to a float.\n2. Filter out the numbers that are greater than 34.39.\n3. Convert the filtered numbers back to strings.\n4. Return the new list in the specified format.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these steps:\n\n```python\n# Original list of strings\noriginal_list = ['2', '-47.0', '64.4', '-47.3', '2.4465', '-61', '62.5076', '-26.866']\n\n# Convert strings to floats and filter numbers greater than 34.39\nfiltered_list = [str(num) for num in map(float, original_list) if num > 34.39]\n\n# Print the filtered list\nprint(filtered_list)\n```\n\nThis script will output the filtered list of numbers as strings. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and filtered the numbers greater than 34.39 from the list. The filtered numbers are '64.4' and '62.5076', which are returned as strings in a new list.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<['64.4', '62.5076']>>>"
