    "To solve this problem, we need to filter out all numbers from the given list that are smaller than -27.451. The list contains string representations of numbers, so we need to convert these strings to floats for comparison. After filtering, we will convert the numbers back to strings to maintain the original format of the list.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n1. Convert each string in the list to a float.\n2. Filter out numbers that are smaller than -27.451.\n3. Convert the remaining numbers back to strings.\n4. Return the new list in the specified format.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Original list of numbers as strings\nnumbers = ['-45.336', '29', '-28.3276', '-32.32', '31.6609', '77', '11.7', '64', '-17.17']\n\n# Convert strings to floats and filter out numbers smaller than -27.451\nfiltered_numbers = [num for num in numbers if float(num) >= -27.451]\n\n# Print the filtered list\nprint(filtered_numbers)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to get the filtered list.",
    "The code executed successfully, and we have filtered out the numbers smaller than -27.451. The resulting list contains only the numbers that are greater than or equal to -27.451, and they are still in their original string format.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<['29', '31.6609', '77', '11.7', '64', '-17.17']>>>"
