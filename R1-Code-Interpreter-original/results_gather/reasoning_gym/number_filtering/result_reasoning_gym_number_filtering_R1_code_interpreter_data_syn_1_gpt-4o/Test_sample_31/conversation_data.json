    "To solve this problem, we need to filter out all numbers from the given list that are smaller than 42.7. The list contains string representations of numbers, so we need to convert these strings to floats for comparison. After filtering, we will convert the numbers back to strings to maintain the original format of the list.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Convert each string in the list to a float.\n2. Filter out numbers that are smaller than 42.7.\n3. Convert the remaining numbers back to strings.\n4. Return the new list in the specified format.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Original list of numbers as strings\nnumbers = ['-11.15', '-3', '-23', '-84.9', '-41.85', '68.5067', '-88.0', '-34.37', '20', '94.5472']\n\n# Convert strings to floats and filter out numbers smaller than 42.7\nfiltered_numbers = [num for num in numbers if float(num) >= 42.7]\n\n# Print the filtered list\nprint(filtered_numbers)\n```\n\nThis code will filter the list and print the new list with numbers greater than or equal to 42.7. Let's execute this code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and filtered out the numbers smaller than 42.7. The resulting list contains only the numbers that are greater than or equal to 42.7, which are '68.5067' and '94.5472'.\n\nNow, I will provide the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<['68.5067', '94.5472']>>>"
