    "To solve this problem, we need to filter out numbers from the list that are larger than -24. The list contains strings representing numbers, so we need to convert these strings to floats for comparison. After filtering, we will convert the numbers back to strings to maintain the original format.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n1. Convert each string in the list to a float.\n2. Filter out numbers that are larger than -24.\n3. Convert the remaining numbers back to strings.\n4. Return the new list in the specified format.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Original list of strings\nnumbers = ['-31', '-35.3010', '2', '35.97']\n\n# Convert strings to floats, filter, and convert back to strings\nfiltered_numbers = [num for num in numbers if float(num) <= -24]\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(filtered_numbers)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to get the filtered list.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the filtered list of numbers that are less than or equal to -24. The numbers have been converted back to strings to match the original format.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<['-31', '-35.3010']>>>"
