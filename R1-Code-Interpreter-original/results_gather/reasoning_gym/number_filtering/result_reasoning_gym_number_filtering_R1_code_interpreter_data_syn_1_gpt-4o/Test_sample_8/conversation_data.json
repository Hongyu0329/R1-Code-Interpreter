    "To solve this problem, we need to filter the list of strings representing numbers and keep only those numbers that are smaller than -63.1164. The steps involved are:\n\n1. Convert the list of string numbers to a list of floats.\n2. Filter the list to keep only those numbers that are less than -63.1164.\n3. Convert the filtered list of floats back to strings.\n4. Return the new list in the specified format.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Original list of numbers as strings\nnumbers = ['15.8975', '-93.63', '32.9', '-74.33', '-44.576', '63.7749', '79.2', '-88.1', '23.916', '70']\n\n# Convert strings to floats and filter\nfiltered_numbers = [num for num in numbers if float(num) < -63.1164]\n\n# Print the filtered list\nprint(filtered_numbers)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the filtered list.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the filtered list of numbers that are smaller than -63.1164. Now, let's format the final answer as requested.\n\n<<<['-93.63', '-74.33', '-88.1']>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
