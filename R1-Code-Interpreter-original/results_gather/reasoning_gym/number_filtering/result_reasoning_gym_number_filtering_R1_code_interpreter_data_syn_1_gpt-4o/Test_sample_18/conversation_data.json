    "To solve this problem, we need to filter out numbers from the given list that are smaller than 93.8156. The list contains string representations of numbers, so we need to convert them to floats for comparison. After filtering, we'll convert the numbers back to strings to maintain the original format.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Convert each string in the list to a float.\n2. Compare each float to 93.8156 and keep only those that are smaller.\n3. Convert the filtered floats back to strings.\n4. Return the new list in the specified format.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Original list of numbers as strings\nnumbers = ['71.14', '27.5', '38.51', '-82.96', '-55.1214', '-83.0', '-31', '95.94', '-56', '94.48']\n\n# Threshold value\nthreshold = 93.8156\n\n# Filter numbers smaller than the threshold\nfiltered_numbers = [num for num in numbers if float(num) < threshold]\n\n# Print the filtered list\nprint(filtered_numbers)\n```\n\nThis code will filter the list and print the new list of numbers that are smaller than 93.8156.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the filtered list of numbers that are smaller than 93.8156. Now, I will provide the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<['71.14', '27.5', '38.51', '-82.96', '-55.1214', '-83.0', '-31', '-56']>>>"
