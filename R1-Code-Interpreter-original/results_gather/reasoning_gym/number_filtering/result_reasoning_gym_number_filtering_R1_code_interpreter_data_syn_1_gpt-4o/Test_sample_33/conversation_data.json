    "To solve this problem, we need to filter out the numbers from the given list that are larger than -14.5. The list contains string representations of numbers, so we need to convert them to floats for comparison. After filtering, we will convert the numbers back to strings to match the original format.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n1. Convert each string in the list to a float.\n2. Filter out the numbers that are greater than -14.5.\n3. Convert the filtered numbers back to strings.\n4. Return the new list in the specified format.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Original list of numbers as strings\nnumbers = ['-42.2311', '68.942', '-8.309', '10.25', '65.178', '80', '77.083', '-47.192', '25']\n\n# Convert strings to floats and filter numbers greater than -14.5\nfiltered_numbers = [num for num in numbers if float(num) > -14.5]\n\n# Print the filtered list\nprint(filtered_numbers)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the filtered list.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the filtered list of numbers that are greater than -14.5. Now, I will provide the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<['68.942', '-8.309', '10.25', '65.178', '80', '77.083', '25']>>>"
