    "To solve this problem, we need to filter out the numbers from the given list that are smaller than 16. The list contains strings representing numbers, so we need to convert these strings to floats, perform the comparison, and then convert the filtered numbers back to strings to maintain the original format.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Convert each string in the list to a float.\n2. Check if the float is smaller than 16.\n3. If it is, keep it in the list.\n4. Convert the filtered floats back to strings.\n5. Return the new list in the specified format.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these steps:\n\n```python\n# Original list of numbers as strings\nnumbers = ['30.77', '-96.4252', '-30.430']\n\n# Filter numbers smaller than 16\nfiltered_numbers = [num for num in numbers if float(num) < 16]\n\n# Print the filtered list\nprint(filtered_numbers)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to get the filtered list.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the filtered list of numbers that are smaller than 16. The numbers were initially in string format, and after filtering, they remain in string format as required.\n\nThe final answer, with the filtered list enclosed within triple angle brackets, is:\n\n<<<['-96.4252', '-30.430']>>>"
