    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach. The idea is to treat the grid as a graph where each cell is a node. We start by enqueuing all the initially rotten oranges and perform a multi-source BFS to spread the rot to adjacent fresh oranges. We keep track of the time taken for each level of BFS, which corresponds to the minutes elapsed.\n\nHere's a step-by-step outline of the approach:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue all the initially rotten oranges with their positions and the initial time (0 minutes).\n2. Count the total number of fresh oranges.\n3. Perform BFS:\n   - For each rotten orange, check its 4-directional neighbors.\n   - If a neighbor is a fresh orange, rot it, decrease the count of fresh oranges, and enqueue it with the incremented time.\n4. Continue the process until the queue is empty.\n5. If there are no fresh oranges left, return the time taken. If there are still fresh oranges, return -1.\n\nLet's implement this approach in code.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef min_minutes_to_rot(grid):\n    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    queue = deque()\n    fresh_count = 0\n    \n    # Initialize the queue with all initially rotten oranges\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] == 2:\n                queue.append((r, c, 0))  # (row, col, time)\n            elif grid[r][c] == 1:\n                fresh_count += 1\n    \n    # Directions for 4-directional adjacency\n    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]\n    minutes_elapsed = 0\n    \n    # Perform BFS\n    while queue:\n        r, c, minutes = queue.popleft()\n        minutes_elapsed = max(minutes_elapsed, minutes)\n        \n        for dr, dc in directions:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and grid[nr][nc] == 1:\n                # Rot the fresh orange\n                grid[nr][nc] = 2\n                fresh_count -= 1\n                queue.append((nr, nc, minutes + 1))\n    \n    # If there are still fresh oranges left, return -1\n    if fresh_count > 0:\n        return -1\n    return minutes_elapsed\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1],\n    [2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 0, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2],\n    [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1],\n    [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2]\n]\n\n# Calculate the minimum number of minutes\nmin_minutes = min_minutes_to_rot(grid)\nmin_minutes\nassistant > The minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange is <<<8>>>."
