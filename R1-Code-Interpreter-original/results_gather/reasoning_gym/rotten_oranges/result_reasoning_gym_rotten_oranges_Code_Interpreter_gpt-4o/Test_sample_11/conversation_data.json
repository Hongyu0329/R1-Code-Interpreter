    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. We will start by identifying all the rotten oranges (value 2) and add them to a queue. Then, we will perform a BFS to spread the rot to adjacent fresh oranges (value 1). We will keep track of the time taken for each level of BFS, which corresponds to the number of minutes elapsed.\n\nHere's a step-by-step outline of the approach:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and add all the initial positions of rotten oranges to it.\n2. Count the number of fresh oranges.\n3. Perform a BFS from the rotten oranges:\n   - For each rotten orange, check its 4-directional neighbors.\n   - If a neighbor is a fresh orange, rot it (change its value to 2) and add it to the queue.\n   - Decrease the count of fresh oranges.\n4. Keep track of the number of minutes elapsed.\n5. If there are no fresh oranges left, return the number of minutes elapsed. If there are still fresh oranges left after the BFS completes, return -1.\n\nLet's implement this approach in code.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef min_minutes_to_rot(grid):\n    # Directions for 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right)\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n    \n    # Initialize the queue and count fresh oranges\n    queue = deque()\n    fresh_count = 0\n    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    \n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] == 2:\n                queue.append((r, c))\n            elif grid[r][c] == 1:\n                fresh_count += 1\n    \n    # If there are no fresh oranges, return 0\n    if fresh_count == 0:\n        return 0\n    \n    # Perform BFS\n    minutes = 0\n    while queue:\n        # Process all oranges that will rot in this minute\n        for _ in range(len(queue)):\n            x, y = queue.popleft()\n            for dx, dy in directions:\n                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n                if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and grid[nx][ny] == 1:\n                    grid[nx][ny] = 2\n                    queue.append((nx, ny))\n                    fresh_count -= 1\n        \n        # Increment minutes after processing each level\n        if queue:\n            minutes += 1\n    \n    # If there are still fresh oranges left, return -1\n    return minutes if fresh_count == 0 else -1\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 0],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1],\n    [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n]\n\n# Calculate the minimum number of minutes\nresult = min_minutes_to_rot(grid)\nresult\nassistant > The result is that it is impossible to rot all the fresh oranges in the given grid.
