    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. We will start by identifying all the rotten oranges (value 2) and add them to a queue. Then, we will perform a BFS to spread the rot to adjacent fresh oranges (value 1). We will keep track of the time taken for each level of BFS, which corresponds to the minutes elapsed.\n\nHere's a step-by-step outline of the approach:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and add all the initial positions of rotten oranges to it.\n2. Count the number of fresh oranges.\n3. Perform a BFS from the rotten oranges:\n   - For each rotten orange, check its 4-directional neighbors.\n   - If a neighbor is a fresh orange, rot it (change its value to 2) and add it to the queue.\n   - Decrease the count of fresh oranges.\n4. Keep track of the number of minutes elapsed.\n5. If there are no fresh oranges left, return the number of minutes elapsed. If there are still fresh oranges left after the BFS completes, return -1.\n\nLet's implement this approach in code.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef min_minutes_to_rot(grid):\n    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    queue = deque()\n    fresh_count = 0\n    \n    # Initialize the queue with all rotten oranges and count fresh oranges\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] == 2:\n                queue.append((r, c))\n            elif grid[r][c] == 1:\n                fresh_count += 1\n    \n    # Directions for 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right)\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n    minutes_elapsed = 0\n    \n    # Perform BFS\n    while queue and fresh_count > 0:\n        minutes_elapsed += 1\n        for _ in range(len(queue)):\n            x, y = queue.popleft()\n            for dx, dy in directions:\n                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n                if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and grid[nx][ny] == 1:\n                    grid[nx][ny] = 2\n                    fresh_count -= 1\n                    queue.append((nx, ny))\n    \n    # If there are still fresh oranges left, return -1\n    return minutes_elapsed if fresh_count == 0 else -1\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1],\n    [1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1],\n    [2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1],\n    [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1],\n    [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n]\n\n# Calculate the minimum number of minutes\nmin_minutes = min_minutes_to_rot(grid)\nmin_minutes\nassistant > It seems there was an issue with executing the code.

However, I can provide you with the logic and steps to implement this solution in your local environment:\n\n1. **Initialize a Queue**: Use a queue to store the positions of all initially rotten oranges.\n\n2. **Count Fresh Oranges**: Traverse the grid to count the number of fresh oranges and add the positions of rotten oranges to the queue.\n\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:\n   - For each rotten orange, check its 4-directional neighbors.\n   - If a neighbor is a fresh orange, rot it (change its value to 2) and add it to the queue.\n   - Decrease the count of fresh oranges.\n   - Keep track of the number of minutes elapsed.\n\n4. **Check Remaining Fresh Oranges**: If there are no fresh oranges left, return the number of minutes elapsed. If there are still fresh oranges left after the BFS completes, return -1.\n\nYou can implement this logic in Python using the `collections.deque` for the queue and a nested loop to traverse the grid.
