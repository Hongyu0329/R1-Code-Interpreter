    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. We will start by identifying all the rotten oranges (value 2) and add them to a queue. Then, we will perform a BFS to spread the rot to adjacent fresh oranges (value 1). We will keep track of the time taken to rot all the fresh oranges.

Let's try running the code again to determine the minimum number of minutes required.# Retry the calculation of the minimum number of minutes\nresult = orangesRotting(grid)\nresult\nassistant > It appears that the system is currently unable to process the request due to resource constraints. However, I can guide you through the logic and steps to implement this solution on your local machine:\n\n1. **Initialize the Queue**: Start by identifying all the rotten oranges (value 2) in the grid and add their positions to a queue. Also, count the number of fresh oranges (value 1).\n\n2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Use BFS to simulate the process of rotting. For each rotten orange, check its 4-directional neighbors. If a neighbor is a fresh orange, rot it (change its value to 2) and add it to the queue. Decrease the count of fresh oranges.\n\n3. **Track Time**: Keep track of the number of minutes passed during the BFS process. Each level of BFS represents one minute.\n\n4. **Check for Remaining Fresh Oranges**: After the BFS completes, check if there are any fresh oranges left. If there are, return -1, indicating it's impossible to rot all oranges. Otherwise, return the number of minutes passed.\n\nYou can implement this logic in Python using the `collections.deque` for the queue and iterating over the grid to perform the BFS.
