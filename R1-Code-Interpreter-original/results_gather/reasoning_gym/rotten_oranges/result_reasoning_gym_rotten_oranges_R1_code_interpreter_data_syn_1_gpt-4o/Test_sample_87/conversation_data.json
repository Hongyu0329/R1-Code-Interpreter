    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to model the spread of rot from initially rotten oranges to adjacent fresh oranges. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Initialize the Grid and Variables**:\n   - Parse the grid to identify the positions of all initially rotten oranges and count the number of fresh oranges.\n   - Use a queue to perform BFS, starting with all initially rotten oranges.\n\n2. **BFS Simulation**:\n   - For each minute, process all rotten oranges in the queue.\n   - For each rotten orange, attempt to rot any adjacent fresh oranges (up, down, left, right).\n   - If a fresh orange becomes rotten, decrease the count of fresh oranges and add the new rotten orange to the queue.\n\n3. **Check for Completion**:\n   - Continue the process until there are no more fresh oranges or the queue is empty.\n   - If there are still fresh oranges left after the queue is empty, it means some fresh oranges are unreachable by any rotten orange, and we return -1.\n   - Otherwise, return the number of minutes elapsed.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef orangesRotting(grid):\n    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    queue = deque()\n    fresh_count = 0\n\n    # Initialize the queue with all initially rotten oranges\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] == 2:\n                queue.append((r, c))\n            elif grid[r][c] == 1:\n                fresh_count += 1\n\n    # Directions for adjacent cells (up, down, left, right)\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n    minutes_passed = 0\n\n    # BFS to rot adjacent fresh oranges\n    while queue and fresh_count > 0:\n        minutes_passed += 1\n        for _ in range(len(queue)):\n            x, y = queue.popleft()\n            for dx, dy in directions:\n                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n                if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and grid[nx][ny] == 1:\n                    grid[nx][ny] = 2\n                    fresh_count -= 1\n                    queue.append((nx, ny))\n\n    # If there are still fresh oranges left, return -1\n    return minutes_passed if fresh_count == 0 else -1\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],\n    [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2],\n    [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1],\n    [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0],\n    [1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n]\n\n# Calculate the minimum number of minutes\nresult = orangesRotting(grid)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThe code will be executed to determine the minimum number of minutes required for all fresh oranges to rot, or if it's impossible.",
