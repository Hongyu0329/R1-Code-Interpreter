    "To solve this problem, we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach. The idea is to treat the grid as a graph where each cell is a node. We will start from all the rotten oranges (value 2) and perform a multi-source BFS to spread the rot to adjacent fresh oranges (value 1). \n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Initialize the Queue**: We will use a queue to perform BFS. Initially, we will enqueue all the positions of rotten oranges along with the time (minute) at which they are rotten, which is 0 at the start.\n\n2. **Count Fresh Oranges**: We will also count the number of fresh oranges at the start. This will help us determine if it's possible to rot all fresh oranges.\n\n3. **BFS Process**: We will process each rotten orange in the queue, and for each rotten orange, we will try to rot its adjacent fresh oranges. If a fresh orange is rotted, we will decrease the count of fresh oranges and enqueue the new rotten orange with the incremented time.\n\n4. **Check Completion**: After the BFS completes, if there are still fresh oranges left, it means not all oranges can be rotted, and we return -1. Otherwise, we return the maximum time taken to rot all oranges.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef orangesRotting(grid):\n    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    queue = deque()\n    fresh_count = 0\n    \n    # Initialize the queue with all rotten oranges and count fresh oranges\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] == 2:\n                queue.append((r, c, 0))  # (row, col, time)\n            elif grid[r][c] == 1:\n                fresh_count += 1\n    \n    # Directions for 4-directional adjacency\n    directions = [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]\n    max_time = 0\n    \n    # BFS to rot adjacent fresh oranges\n    while queue:\n        r, c, time = queue.popleft()\n        max_time = max(max_time, time)\n        \n        for dr, dc in directions:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and grid[nr][nc] == 1:\n                grid[nr][nc] = 2  # Rot the fresh orange\n                fresh_count -= 1\n                queue.append((nr, nc, time + 1))\n    \n    # If there are still fresh oranges left, return -1\n    if fresh_count > 0:\n        return -1\n    else:\n        return max_time\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1],\n    [1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0],\n    [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0],\n    [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n]\n\n# Get the result\nresult = orangesRotting(grid)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will determine the minimum number of minutes required to rot all fresh oranges or return -1 if it's impossible. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
    "The code output indicates that it's impossible to rot all fresh oranges, which means there are some fresh oranges that cannot be reached by any rotten orange. This could be due to the presence of isolated fresh oranges that are not adjacent to any rotten oranges or are blocked by empty cells (0).\n\nLet's analyze the grid to confirm this:\n\n- The grid is a 16x16 matrix.\n- We have multiple rotten oranges (2) scattered throughout the grid.\n- If any fresh orange (1) is completely surrounded by empty cells (0) or is isolated in such a way that no rotten orange can reach it, then it will remain fresh indefinitely.\n\nGiven the grid structure and the BFS approach, the code correctly identifies that not all fresh oranges can be rotted, hence returning -1.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-1>>>"
