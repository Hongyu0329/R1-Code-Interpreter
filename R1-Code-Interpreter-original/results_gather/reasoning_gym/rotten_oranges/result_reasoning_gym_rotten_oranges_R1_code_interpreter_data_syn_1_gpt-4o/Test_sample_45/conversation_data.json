    "To solve this problem, we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach. The idea is to treat the grid as a graph where each cell is a node. We will start from all the rotten oranges (value 2) and try to spread the rot to adjacent fresh oranges (value 1) in each minute. We will keep track of the time it takes for all fresh oranges to become rotten. If there are any fresh oranges left after the BFS completes, it means they cannot be reached by any rotten orange, and we should return -1.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Initialize a queue to perform BFS. Enqueue all the initial positions of rotten oranges along with the initial time (0 minutes).\n2. Count the number of fresh oranges.\n3. Perform BFS:\n   - For each rotten orange, try to rot the adjacent fresh oranges.\n   - If a fresh orange is rotted, decrease the count of fresh oranges and enqueue the new rotten orange with the incremented time.\n4. Keep track of the maximum time taken to rot all reachable fresh oranges.\n5. If there are any fresh oranges left after the BFS, return -1. Otherwise, return the maximum time.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef orangesRotting(grid):\n    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    queue = deque()\n    fresh_count = 0\n    \n    # Initialize the queue with all rotten oranges and count fresh oranges\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] == 2:\n                queue.append((r, c, 0))  # (row, col, time)\n            elif grid[r][c] == 1:\n                fresh_count += 1\n    \n    # Directions for 4-directional adjacency\n    directions = [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]\n    max_time = 0\n    \n    # BFS\n    while queue:\n        r, c, time = queue.popleft()\n        max_time = max(max_time, time)\n        \n        for dr, dc in directions:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and grid[nr][nc] == 1:\n                grid[nr][nc] = 2  # Rot the fresh orange\n                fresh_count -= 1\n                queue.append((nr, nc, time + 1))\n    \n    # If there are still fresh oranges left, return -1\n    if fresh_count > 0:\n        return -1\n    return max_time\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],\n    [2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0],\n    [2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],\n    [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0],\n    [1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],\n    [1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2],\n    [1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1],\n    [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2],\n    [1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2]\n]\n\n# Get the result\nresult = orangesRotting(grid)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the minimum number of minutes required for all fresh oranges to become rotten, or return -1 if it's impossible.",
    "The output of -1 indicates that there are fresh oranges that cannot be reached by any rotten orange, meaning it's impossible for all fresh oranges to become rotten. This is consistent with the problem's requirements and the grid configuration provided.\n\nLet's break down why this might be the case:\n\n1. **Isolated Fresh Oranges**: There might be fresh oranges that are completely surrounded by empty cells (0s) or other fresh oranges, with no path to a rotten orange. This would make it impossible for these fresh oranges to ever become rotten.\n\n2. **Disconnected Components**: The grid might have sections that are completely isolated from each other, with no rotten oranges in some sections.\n\nGiven the grid configuration and the BFS approach, the code correctly identifies that not all fresh oranges can be reached and thus returns -1.\n\nIf you have any specific questions or need further clarification on the grid or the BFS process, feel free to ask! Otherwise, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-1>>>"
