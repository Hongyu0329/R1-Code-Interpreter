    "To solve this problem, we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach. The idea is to treat the grid as a graph where each cell is a node. We will start by enqueuing all the initially rotten oranges and perform a multi-source BFS to spread the rot to adjacent fresh oranges. We will keep track of the time taken for each level of BFS, which corresponds to the minutes elapsed.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Initialize the Queue**: Start by enqueuing all the rotten oranges (value 2) along with the initial time (0 minutes).\n\n2. **Count Fresh Oranges**: Count the number of fresh oranges (value 1) in the grid. If there are no fresh oranges, return 0 immediately.\n\n3. **BFS Process**:\n   - For each rotten orange in the queue, check its 4-directional neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n   - If a neighbor is a fresh orange, rot it (change its value to 2), decrease the fresh orange count, and enqueue it with the incremented time.\n   - Keep track of the maximum time taken to rot all reachable fresh oranges.\n\n4. **Check Remaining Fresh Oranges**: After the BFS completes, if there are still fresh oranges left, return -1 as it's impossible to rot all oranges. Otherwise, return the maximum time recorded.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef orangesRotting(grid):\n    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    queue = deque()\n    fresh_count = 0\n    \n    # Initialize the queue with all rotten oranges and count fresh oranges\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] == 2:\n                queue.append((r, c, 0))  # (row, col, time)\n            elif grid[r][c] == 1:\n                fresh_count += 1\n    \n    # Directions for 4-directional adjacency\n    directions = [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]\n    max_time = 0\n    \n    # BFS\n    while queue:\n        r, c, time = queue.popleft()\n        max_time = max(max_time, time)\n        \n        for dr, dc in directions:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and grid[nr][nc] == 1:\n                grid[nr][nc] = 2  # Rot the fresh orange\n                fresh_count -= 1\n                queue.append((nr, nc, time + 1))\n    \n    # If there are still fresh oranges left, return -1\n    if fresh_count > 0:\n        return -1\n    return max_time\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 0],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1],\n    [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n]\n\n# Calculate the minimum number of minutes\nresult = orangesRotting(grid)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the minimum number of minutes required.",
    "The code output indicates that it is impossible to rot all the fresh oranges, which means there are some fresh oranges that cannot be reached by any rotten orange. This is likely due to the presence of isolated fresh oranges that are not adjacent to any rotten oranges or are blocked by empty cells (0).\n\nGiven the grid configuration, if there are any fresh oranges that are completely surrounded by empty cells or are not reachable from any rotten orange, the result will be -1, as the BFS will not be able to reach and rot those fresh oranges.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-1>>>"
