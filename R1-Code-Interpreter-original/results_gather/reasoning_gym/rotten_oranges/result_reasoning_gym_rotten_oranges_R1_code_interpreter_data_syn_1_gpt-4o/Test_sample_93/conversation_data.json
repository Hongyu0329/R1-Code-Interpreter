    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of rotting oranges over time. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to model the spread of rot from rotten oranges to adjacent fresh oranges. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Initialize the Grid**: Start by parsing the grid to identify the initial positions of rotten oranges and count the number of fresh oranges.\n\n2. **Use a Queue for BFS**: Use a queue to perform BFS. Initially, enqueue all the positions of rotten oranges along with a timestamp (minute) of 0.\n\n3. **Simulate the Rotting Process**: For each rotten orange, check its 4-directional neighbors (up, down, left, right). If a neighbor is a fresh orange, it becomes rotten, and we enqueue its position with the current timestamp + 1.\n\n4. **Track Time and Fresh Oranges**: Keep track of the maximum time taken to rot all reachable fresh oranges. Also, decrement the count of fresh oranges each time one becomes rotten.\n\n5. **Check for Remaining Fresh Oranges**: After the BFS completes, if there are still fresh oranges left, return -1. Otherwise, return the maximum time recorded.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef orangesRotting(grid):\n    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    queue = deque()\n    fresh_count = 0\n    \n    # Initialize the queue with all rotten oranges and count fresh oranges\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] == 2:\n                queue.append((r, c, 0))  # (row, col, time)\n            elif grid[r][c] == 1:\n                fresh_count += 1\n    \n    # Directions for 4-directional adjacency\n    directions = [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]\n    max_time = 0\n    \n    # BFS to rot adjacent fresh oranges\n    while queue:\n        r, c, time = queue.popleft()\n        max_time = max(max_time, time)\n        \n        for dr, dc in directions:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and grid[nr][nc] == 1:\n                grid[nr][nc] = 2  # Rot the fresh orange\n                fresh_count -= 1\n                queue.append((nr, nc, time + 1))\n    \n    # If there are still fresh oranges, return -1\n    if fresh_count > 0:\n        return -1\n    return max_time\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2],\n    [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],\n    [1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],\n    [0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1],\n    [1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2],\n    [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n    [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n    [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n]\n\n# Calculate the minimum number of minutes\nresult = orangesRotting(grid)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the minimum number of minutes required for all fresh oranges to rot, or return -1 if it's impossible.",
    "The output of -1 indicates that there are fresh oranges that cannot be reached by any rotten oranges, meaning it's impossible to rot all fresh oranges. This can happen if fresh oranges are isolated by empty cells (0s) or are not adjacent to any rotten oranges.\n\nLet's verify the logic and ensure that the BFS implementation correctly identifies unreachable fresh oranges. The code seems to be functioning as expected, given the grid configuration. If there are any fresh oranges that are completely isolated or surrounded by empty cells, they will never rot, leading to the result of -1.\n\nIf you have any specific concerns or need further clarification on the result, please let me know! Otherwise, the result of -1 is the correct answer for this grid configuration.\n\n<<<-1>>>"
