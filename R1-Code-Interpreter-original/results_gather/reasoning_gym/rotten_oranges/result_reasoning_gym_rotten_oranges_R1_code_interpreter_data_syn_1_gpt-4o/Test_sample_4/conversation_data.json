    "To solve this problem, we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach. The idea is to treat the grid as a graph where each cell is a node. We start by enqueuing all the initially rotten oranges and then perform a BFS to spread the rot to adjacent fresh oranges. We keep track of the time taken to rot all the fresh oranges. If there are any fresh oranges left after the BFS completes, it means they cannot be rotted, and we return -1.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue all the initially rotten oranges with their time (minute) as 0.\n2. Count the total number of fresh oranges.\n3. Perform BFS:\n   - Dequeue an orange and check its adjacent cells.\n   - If an adjacent cell contains a fresh orange, rot it, decrease the fresh orange count, and enqueue it with the incremented time.\n4. Keep track of the maximum time taken to rot all oranges.\n5. If there are any fresh oranges left after the BFS, return -1. Otherwise, return the maximum time.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef orangesRotting(grid):\n    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    queue = deque()\n    fresh_count = 0\n    \n    # Initialize the queue with all rotten oranges and count fresh oranges\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] == 2:\n                queue.append((r, c, 0))  # (row, col, time)\n            elif grid[r][c] == 1:\n                fresh_count += 1\n    \n    # Directions for 4-directional adjacency\n    directions = [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]\n    max_time = 0\n    \n    # BFS\n    while queue:\n        r, c, time = queue.popleft()\n        max_time = max(max_time, time)\n        \n        for dr, dc in directions:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and grid[nr][nc] == 1:\n                grid[nr][nc] = 2  # Rot the fresh orange\n                fresh_count -= 1\n                queue.append((nr, nc, time + 1))\n    \n    # If there are still fresh oranges left, return -1\n    return -1 if fresh_count > 0 else max_time\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0],\n    [1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],\n    [1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0],\n    [1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2],\n    [2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1],\n    [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 0, 0, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2],\n    [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 0, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1],\n    [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1],\n    [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2]\n]\n\n# Calculate the minimum number of minutes\nresult = orangesRotting(grid)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will determine the minimum number of minutes required to rot all fresh oranges or return -1 if it's impossible.",
    "The output of -1 indicates that there are fresh oranges that cannot be reached by any rotten oranges, meaning they cannot be rotted. This is consistent with the problem's requirement to return -1 if it's impossible to rot all fresh oranges.\n\nLet's verify the reasoning:\n\n1. We initialized the queue with all rotten oranges and counted the fresh oranges.\n2. We performed a BFS to spread the rot to adjacent fresh oranges.\n3. After the BFS, if there are any fresh oranges left, it means they are isolated and cannot be rotted.\n\nGiven the grid provided, it seems there are fresh oranges that are not adjacent to any rotten oranges, which is why the result is -1.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-1>>>"
