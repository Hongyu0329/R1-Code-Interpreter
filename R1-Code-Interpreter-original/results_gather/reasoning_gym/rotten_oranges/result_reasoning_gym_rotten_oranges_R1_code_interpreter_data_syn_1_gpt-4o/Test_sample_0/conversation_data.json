    "To solve this problem, we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach. The idea is to treat the grid as a graph where each cell is a node. We will start from all the rotten oranges (value 2) and perform a multi-source BFS to spread the rot to adjacent fresh oranges (value 1). \n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Initialize the Queue**: We will use a queue to perform BFS. Initially, we will enqueue all the positions of rotten oranges along with the time (minute) they start rotting, which is 0.\n\n2. **Track Fresh Oranges**: We need to keep track of the number of fresh oranges. If at the end of the BFS there are still fresh oranges left, it means not all oranges can be rotten, and we should return -1.\n\n3. **BFS Process**: For each rotten orange, we will check its 4-directional neighbors (up, down, left, right). If a neighbor is a fresh orange, it becomes rotten, and we enqueue this new rotten orange with the incremented time.\n\n4. **Calculate Time**: The time taken for all oranges to rot will be the maximum time value in the queue when we finish processing.\n\n5. **Check for Remaining Fresh Oranges**: If there are still fresh oranges left after the BFS, return -1. Otherwise, return the time calculated.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef orangesRotting(grid):\n    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    queue = deque()\n    fresh_oranges = 0\n\n    # Initialize the queue with all rotten oranges and count fresh oranges\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] == 2:\n                queue.append((r, c, 0))  # (row, col, time)\n            elif grid[r][c] == 1:\n                fresh_oranges += 1\n\n    # Directions for 4-directional adjacency\n    directions = [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]\n    time_elapsed = 0\n\n    # BFS\n    while queue:\n        r, c, time = queue.popleft()\n        time_elapsed = max(time_elapsed, time)\n\n        for dr, dc in directions:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and grid[nr][nc] == 1:\n                grid[nr][nc] = 2  # Mark as rotten\n                fresh_oranges -= 1\n                queue.append((nr, nc, time + 1))\n\n    # If there are still fresh oranges left, return -1\n    if fresh_oranges > 0:\n        return -1\n    else:\n        return time_elapsed\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1],\n    [2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 0, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2],\n    [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1],\n    [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2]\n]\n\n# Calculate the minimum number of minutes\nresult = orangesRotting(grid)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the minimum number of minutes required for all fresh oranges to become rotten, or return -1 if it's impossible.",
