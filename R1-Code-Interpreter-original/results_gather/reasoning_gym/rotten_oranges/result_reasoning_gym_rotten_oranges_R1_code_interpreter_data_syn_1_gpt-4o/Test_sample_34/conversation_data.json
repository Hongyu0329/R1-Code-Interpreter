    "To solve this problem, we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach. The idea is to treat the grid as a graph where each cell is a node. We will start by enqueuing all the initially rotten oranges and then perform a BFS to spread the rot to adjacent fresh oranges. Each level of BFS represents a minute passing.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue all the positions of the rotten oranges (value 2) along with the initial time (0 minutes).\n2. Count the number of fresh oranges (value 1) in the grid.\n3. Perform BFS:\n   - For each rotten orange, check its 4-directional neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n   - If a neighbor is a fresh orange, rot it (change its value to 2), decrease the count of fresh oranges, and enqueue it with the incremented time.\n4. Continue the process until the queue is empty.\n5. If there are still fresh oranges left after the BFS completes, return -1. Otherwise, return the time taken to rot all oranges.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef orangesRotting(grid):\n    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    queue = deque()\n    fresh_count = 0\n\n    # Initialize the queue with all rotten oranges and count fresh oranges\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] == 2:\n                queue.append((r, c, 0))  # (row, col, time)\n            elif grid[r][c] == 1:\n                fresh_count += 1\n\n    # Directions for 4-directional adjacency\n    directions = [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]\n    time_elapsed = 0\n\n    # BFS to rot adjacent fresh oranges\n    while queue:\n        r, c, time = queue.popleft()\n        time_elapsed = time\n\n        for dr, dc in directions:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and grid[nr][nc] == 1:\n                grid[nr][nc] = 2  # Rot the fresh orange\n                fresh_count -= 1\n                queue.append((nr, nc, time + 1))\n\n    # If there are still fresh oranges left, return -1\n    if fresh_count > 0:\n        return -1\n    else:\n        return time_elapsed\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [1, 1, 0, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2],\n    [1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],\n    [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1],\n    [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2]\n]\n\n# Get the result\nresult = orangesRotting(grid)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the minimum number of minutes required.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the output `9`, which means it takes 9 minutes for all fresh oranges to become rotten. \n\nTherefore, the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange is:\n\n<<<9>>>"
