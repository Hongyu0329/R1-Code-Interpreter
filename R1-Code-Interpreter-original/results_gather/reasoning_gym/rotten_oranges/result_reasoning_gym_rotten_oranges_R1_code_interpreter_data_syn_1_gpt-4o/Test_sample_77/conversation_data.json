    "To solve this problem, we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach. The idea is to treat the grid as a graph where each cell is a node. We will start from all the rotten oranges (value 2) and perform a multi-source BFS to spread the rot to adjacent fresh oranges (value 1). \n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Initialize the Queue**: Start by adding all the rotten oranges to a queue. This queue will help us perform the BFS. Also, keep track of the number of fresh oranges.\n\n2. **BFS Process**: For each minute, process all the rotten oranges in the queue. For each rotten orange, try to rot its adjacent fresh oranges. If a fresh orange is rotted, decrease the count of fresh oranges and add the newly rotten orange to the queue.\n\n3. **Count Minutes**: Keep a counter to track the number of minutes taken for the process. Each level of BFS represents one minute.\n\n4. **Check for Remaining Fresh Oranges**: After the BFS completes, if there are still fresh oranges left, return -1. Otherwise, return the number of minutes taken.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef orangesRotting(grid):\n    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    queue = deque()\n    fresh_oranges = 0\n    \n    # Initialize the queue with all rotten oranges and count fresh oranges\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] == 2:\n                queue.append((r, c))\n            elif grid[r][c] == 1:\n                fresh_oranges += 1\n    \n    # Directions for 4-directional adjacency\n    directions = [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]\n    minutes_passed = 0\n    \n    # BFS\n    while queue and fresh_oranges > 0:\n        minutes_passed += 1\n        for _ in range(len(queue)):\n            x, y = queue.popleft()\n            for dx, dy in directions:\n                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n                if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and grid[nx][ny] == 1:\n                    grid[nx][ny] = 2\n                    fresh_oranges -= 1\n                    queue.append((nx, ny))\n    \n    # If there are still fresh oranges left, return -1\n    return minutes_passed if fresh_oranges == 0 else -1\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1],\n    [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1],\n    [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0],\n    [0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1],\n    [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1],\n    [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0],\n    [2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1]\n]\n\n# Calculate the result\nresult = orangesRotting(grid)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will determine the minimum number of minutes required for all fresh oranges to become rotten, or return -1 if it's impossible. Let's execute the code to find the result.",
    "The output of `-1` indicates that there are fresh oranges that cannot be reached by any rotten oranges, meaning it's impossible for all fresh oranges to become rotten. This can happen if there are isolated fresh oranges that are not adjacent to any rotten oranges and are blocked by empty cells (0).\n\nGiven the grid provided, the BFS algorithm correctly identifies that not all fresh oranges can be rotted, hence the result is `-1`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-1>>>"
