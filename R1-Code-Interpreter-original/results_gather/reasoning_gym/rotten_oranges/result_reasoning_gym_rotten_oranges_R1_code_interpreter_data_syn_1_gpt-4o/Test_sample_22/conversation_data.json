    "To solve this problem, we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach. The idea is to treat the grid as a graph where each cell is a node. We start by enqueuing all the initially rotten oranges and perform a multi-source BFS to spread the rot to adjacent fresh oranges. We keep track of the time taken for each level of BFS, which corresponds to the minutes elapsed.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Initialize the Queue**: Start by enqueuing all the rotten oranges (value 2) with their positions and the initial time (0 minutes).\n\n2. **Track Fresh Oranges**: Count the number of fresh oranges (value 1) initially present in the grid.\n\n3. **BFS Process**: \n   - For each rotten orange, check its 4-directionally adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).\n   - If an adjacent cell contains a fresh orange, rot it (change its value to 2), decrease the count of fresh oranges, and enqueue it with the incremented time.\n   - Continue this process until the queue is empty.\n\n4. **Check Remaining Fresh Oranges**: After the BFS completes, if there are still fresh oranges left, return -1 as it's impossible to rot all oranges. Otherwise, return the time taken.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef orangesRotting(grid):\n    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    queue = deque()\n    fresh_count = 0\n    \n    # Initialize the queue with all rotten oranges and count fresh oranges\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] == 2:\n                queue.append((r, c, 0))  # (row, col, time)\n            elif grid[r][c] == 1:\n                fresh_count += 1\n    \n    # Directions for 4-directional adjacency\n    directions = [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]\n    minutes_elapsed = 0\n    \n    # BFS\n    while queue:\n        r, c, minutes = queue.popleft()\n        minutes_elapsed = max(minutes_elapsed, minutes)\n        \n        for dr, dc in directions:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and grid[nr][nc] == 1:\n                grid[nr][nc] = 2  # Rot the fresh orange\n                fresh_count -= 1\n                queue.append((nr, nc, minutes + 1))\n    \n    # If there are still fresh oranges left, return -1\n    if fresh_count > 0:\n        return -1\n    else:\n        return minutes_elapsed\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0],\n    [2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],\n    [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1],\n    [0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]\n]\n\n# Get the result\nresult = orangesRotting(grid)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will determine the minimum number of minutes required for all fresh oranges to rot, or return -1 if it's impossible.",
