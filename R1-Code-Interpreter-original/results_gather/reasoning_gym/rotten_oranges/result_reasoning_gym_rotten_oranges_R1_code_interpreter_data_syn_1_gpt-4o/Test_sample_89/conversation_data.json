    "To solve this problem, we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach. The idea is to treat the grid as a graph where each cell is a node. We will start by enqueuing all the initially rotten oranges and perform a multi-source BFS to spread the rot to adjacent fresh oranges. We will keep track of the time taken for each level of BFS, which corresponds to the minutes elapsed.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Initialize the Queue**: Start by enqueuing all the rotten oranges (value 2) along with the initial time (0 minutes).\n\n2. **Count Fresh Oranges**: Count the number of fresh oranges (value 1) initially present in the grid.\n\n3. **BFS Process**: Perform BFS from all rotten oranges simultaneously. For each rotten orange, try to rot its adjacent fresh oranges (up, down, left, right). If a fresh orange is rotted, decrement the count of fresh oranges and enqueue the newly rotten orange with the incremented time.\n\n4. **Check Completion**: After the BFS completes, if there are still fresh oranges left, return -1 as it's impossible to rot all oranges. Otherwise, return the time taken.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef orangesRotting(grid):\n    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    queue = deque()\n    fresh_count = 0\n    \n    # Initialize the queue with all rotten oranges and count fresh oranges\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] == 2:\n                queue.append((r, c, 0))  # (row, col, time)\n            elif grid[r][c] == 1:\n                fresh_count += 1\n    \n    # Directions for adjacent cells (up, down, left, right)\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n    time_elapsed = 0\n    \n    # BFS to rot adjacent fresh oranges\n    while queue:\n        r, c, time = queue.popleft()\n        time_elapsed = time\n        \n        for dr, dc in directions:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and grid[nr][nc] == 1:\n                grid[nr][nc] = 2  # Rot the fresh orange\n                fresh_count -= 1\n                queue.append((nr, nc, time + 1))\n    \n    # If there are still fresh oranges left, return -1\n    if fresh_count > 0:\n        return -1\n    else:\n        return time_elapsed\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2],\n    [1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1],\n    [2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2],\n    [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n]\n\n# Get the result\nresult = orangesRotting(grid)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the minimum number of minutes required.",
