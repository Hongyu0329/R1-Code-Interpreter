    "To solve this problem, we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach. The idea is to treat the grid as a graph where each cell is a node. We will start from all the rotten oranges (value 2) and perform a multi-source BFS to spread the rot to adjacent fresh oranges (value 1). \n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Initialize a Queue**: We will use a queue to perform BFS. Initially, we will enqueue all the positions of rotten oranges along with the time (minute) they start rotting, which is 0.\n\n2. **Track Fresh Oranges**: We need to keep track of the number of fresh oranges. If at the end of the BFS there are still fresh oranges left, it means not all oranges can be rotten, and we should return -1.\n\n3. **BFS Process**: For each rotten orange, we will check its 4-directional neighbors (up, down, left, right). If a neighbor is a fresh orange, it becomes rotten, and we enqueue this new rotten orange with the incremented time.\n\n4. **Time Calculation**: The time taken for all oranges to rot will be the maximum time value in the queue when it becomes empty.\n\n5. **Edge Cases**: If there are no fresh oranges initially, the answer is 0. If there are no rotten oranges and there are fresh oranges, the answer is -1.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef orangesRotting(grid):\n    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    queue = deque()\n    fresh_oranges = 0\n\n    # Initialize the queue with all rotten oranges and count fresh oranges\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] == 2:\n                queue.append((r, c, 0))  # (row, col, time)\n            elif grid[r][c] == 1:\n                fresh_oranges += 1\n\n    # Directions for 4-directional adjacency\n    directions = [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]\n    time_elapsed = 0\n\n    # BFS\n    while queue:\n        r, c, time = queue.popleft()\n        time_elapsed = max(time_elapsed, time)\n\n        for dr, dc in directions:\n            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and grid[nr][nc] == 1:\n                grid[nr][nc] = 2  # Mark as rotten\n                fresh_oranges -= 1\n                queue.append((nr, nc, time + 1))\n\n    # If there are still fresh oranges left, return -1\n    if fresh_oranges > 0:\n        return -1\n    return time_elapsed\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1],\n    [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1],\n    [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0],\n    [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1],\n    [1, 0, 2, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],\n    [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0],\n    [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2],\n    [0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2]\n]\n\n# Get the result\nresult = orangesRotting(grid)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the minimum number of minutes required.",
