    "To solve this problem, we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach. The idea is to treat the grid as a graph where each cell is a node. We will start from all the rotten oranges (value 2) and perform a multi-source BFS to spread the rot to adjacent fresh oranges (value 1). \n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Initialize the Queue**: Start by adding all the rotten oranges to a queue. This queue will help us perform the BFS. Also, keep track of the number of fresh oranges.\n\n2. **BFS Process**: For each minute, process all the rotten oranges in the queue. For each rotten orange, try to rot its adjacent fresh oranges. If a fresh orange is rotted, decrease the count of fresh oranges and add the newly rotten orange to the queue.\n\n3. **Count Minutes**: Keep a counter to track the number of minutes passed. Each level of BFS (processing all nodes in the queue) represents one minute.\n\n4. **Check for Remaining Fresh Oranges**: After the BFS completes, check if there are any fresh oranges left. If there are, return -1 as it's impossible to rot all oranges. Otherwise, return the number of minutes.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef orangesRotting(grid):\n    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    queue = deque()\n    fresh_oranges = 0\n    \n    # Initialize the queue with all rotten oranges and count fresh oranges\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] == 2:\n                queue.append((r, c))\n            elif grid[r][c] == 1:\n                fresh_oranges += 1\n    \n    # Directions for 4-directional adjacency\n    directions = [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]\n    minutes_passed = 0\n    \n    # BFS to rot adjacent fresh oranges\n    while queue and fresh_oranges > 0:\n        minutes_passed += 1\n        for _ in range(len(queue)):\n            x, y = queue.popleft()\n            for dx, dy in directions:\n                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n                if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and grid[nx][ny] == 1:\n                    grid[nx][ny] = 2\n                    fresh_oranges -= 1\n                    queue.append((nx, ny))\n    \n    # If there are still fresh oranges left, return -1\n    return minutes_passed if fresh_oranges == 0 else -1\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2],\n    [1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0],\n    [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1],\n    [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0],\n    [2, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2],\n    [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0],\n    [1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0]\n]\n\n# Calculate the result\nresult = orangesRotting(grid)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the minimum number of minutes required for all fresh oranges to rot, or return -1 if it's impossible.",
    "The code output indicates that it's impossible to rot all the fresh oranges, which means there are some fresh oranges that are not reachable by any rotten orange. This is consistent with the problem's requirement to return -1 if not all fresh oranges can be rotted.\n\nLet's verify the logic and ensure that the BFS is correctly implemented:\n\n1. **Initialization**: We start by adding all rotten oranges to the queue and counting the fresh oranges.\n\n2. **BFS Execution**: We process each rotten orange in the queue, rotting adjacent fresh oranges and adding them to the queue.\n\n3. **Check for Remaining Fresh Oranges**: After the BFS completes, if there are still fresh oranges left, it means they are isolated and cannot be rotted.\n\nGiven the grid provided, the output of -1 suggests that there are indeed isolated fresh oranges. This can happen if there are fresh oranges surrounded by empty cells (0) or if they are completely isolated from any rotten oranges.\n\nTherefore, the output of -1 is correct for the given grid, as it indicates that not all fresh oranges can be rotted. \n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<-1>>>"
