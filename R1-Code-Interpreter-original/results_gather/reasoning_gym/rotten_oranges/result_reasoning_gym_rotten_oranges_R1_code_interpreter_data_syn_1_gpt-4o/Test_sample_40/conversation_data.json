    "To solve this problem, we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach. The idea is to treat the grid as a graph where each cell is a node. We will start by identifying all the rotten oranges (value 2) and add them to a queue. Then, we will perform a BFS to spread the rot to adjacent fresh oranges (value 1). Each level of BFS represents a minute passing.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and add all the initial positions of rotten oranges to it.\n2. Count the number of fresh oranges.\n3. Perform BFS:\n   - For each rotten orange, try to rot its adjacent fresh oranges.\n   - If a fresh orange is rotted, decrease the count of fresh oranges.\n   - Keep track of the number of minutes passed.\n4. If there are no fresh oranges left, return the number of minutes. If there are still fresh oranges left after the BFS completes, return -1.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef orangesRotting(grid):\n    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    queue = deque()\n    fresh_oranges = 0\n\n    # Initialize the queue with all rotten oranges and count fresh oranges\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] == 2:\n                queue.append((r, c))\n            elif grid[r][c] == 1:\n                fresh_oranges += 1\n\n    # Directions for 4-directional adjacency\n    directions = [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]\n    minutes_passed = 0\n\n    # BFS to rot adjacent fresh oranges\n    while queue and fresh_oranges > 0:\n        minutes_passed += 1\n        for _ in range(len(queue)):\n            x, y = queue.popleft()\n            for dx, dy in directions:\n                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n                if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and grid[nx][ny] == 1:\n                    grid[nx][ny] = 2\n                    fresh_oranges -= 1\n                    queue.append((nx, ny))\n\n    # If there are still fresh oranges left, return -1\n    return minutes_passed if fresh_oranges == 0 else -1\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1],\n    [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],\n    [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1],\n    [2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1],\n    [2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n]\n\n# Calculate the minimum number of minutes\nresult = orangesRotting(grid)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the minimum number of minutes required.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the output `6`, which means it takes 6 minutes for all fresh oranges to become rotten given the initial grid configuration. \n\nTherefore, the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange is:\n\n<<<6>>>"
