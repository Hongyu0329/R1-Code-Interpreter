    "To solve this problem, we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach. The idea is to treat the grid as a graph where each cell is a node. We will start from all the rotten oranges (value 2) and perform a multi-source BFS to spread the rot to adjacent fresh oranges (value 1). \n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Initialize the Queue**: Start by adding all the rotten oranges to a queue. This queue will help us perform the BFS. Also, keep track of the number of fresh oranges.\n\n2. **BFS Process**: For each minute, process all the rotten oranges in the queue. For each rotten orange, try to rot its adjacent fresh oranges. If a fresh orange is rotted, decrease the count of fresh oranges and add the newly rotten orange to the queue.\n\n3. **Count Minutes**: Keep a counter to track the number of minutes passed. Each level of BFS corresponds to one minute.\n\n4. **Check for Remaining Fresh Oranges**: After the BFS completes, if there are still fresh oranges left, return -1. Otherwise, return the number of minutes.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef orangesRotting(grid):\n    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    queue = deque()\n    fresh_oranges = 0\n\n    # Initialize the queue with all rotten oranges and count fresh oranges\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] == 2:\n                queue.append((r, c))\n            elif grid[r][c] == 1:\n                fresh_oranges += 1\n\n    # Directions for 4-directional adjacency\n    directions = [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]\n    minutes_passed = 0\n\n    # BFS to rot adjacent fresh oranges\n    while queue and fresh_oranges > 0:\n        minutes_passed += 1\n        for _ in range(len(queue)):\n            x, y = queue.popleft()\n            for dx, dy in directions:\n                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n                if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and grid[nx][ny] == 1:\n                    grid[nx][ny] = 2\n                    fresh_oranges -= 1\n                    queue.append((nx, ny))\n\n    # If there are still fresh oranges left, return -1\n    return minutes_passed if fresh_oranges == 0 else -1\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1],\n    [1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1],\n    [2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1],\n    [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1],\n    [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n]\n\n# Get the result\nresult = orangesRotting(grid)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the minimum number of minutes required for all fresh oranges to rot, or return -1 if it's impossible.",
