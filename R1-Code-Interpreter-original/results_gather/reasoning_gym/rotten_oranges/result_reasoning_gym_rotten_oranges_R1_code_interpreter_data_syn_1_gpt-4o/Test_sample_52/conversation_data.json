    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of rotting oranges over time. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, where we start from all initially rotten oranges and spread the rot to adjacent fresh oranges minute by minute.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Initialize the Queue**: Start by identifying all the rotten oranges (value 2) and add their positions to a queue. This queue will help us perform the BFS.\n\n2. **Count Fresh Oranges**: Count the number of fresh oranges (value 1) in the grid. If there are no fresh oranges, the answer is 0 because no time is needed to rot them.\n\n3. **BFS Process**: For each minute, process all the rotten oranges in the queue. For each rotten orange, check its 4-directionally adjacent cells (up, down, left, right). If an adjacent cell contains a fresh orange, rot it (change its value to 2) and add its position to the queue. Decrease the count of fresh oranges.\n\n4. **Track Time**: Keep track of the number of minutes passed during the BFS process.\n\n5. **Check Completion**: If the queue is empty and there are still fresh oranges left, it means not all oranges can be rotted, and we return -1. Otherwise, return the number of minutes passed.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef orangesRotting(grid):\n    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    queue = deque()\n    fresh_count = 0\n\n    # Initialize the queue with all rotten oranges and count fresh oranges\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] == 2:\n                queue.append((r, c))\n            elif grid[r][c] == 1:\n                fresh_count += 1\n\n    # Directions for 4-directional adjacency\n    directions = [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]\n    minutes_passed = 0\n\n    # BFS process\n    while queue and fresh_count > 0:\n        minutes_passed += 1\n        for _ in range(len(queue)):\n            x, y = queue.popleft()\n            for dx, dy in directions:\n                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n                if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and grid[nx][ny] == 1:\n                    grid[nx][ny] = 2\n                    fresh_count -= 1\n                    queue.append((nx, ny))\n\n    # If there are still fresh oranges left, return -1\n    return minutes_passed if fresh_count == 0 else -1\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [0, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],\n    [1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1],\n    [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 2],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n]\n\n# Get the result\nresult = orangesRotting(grid)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will determine the minimum number of minutes required for all fresh oranges to rot, or return -1 if it's impossible.",
    "The output of `-1` indicates that there are fresh oranges that cannot be reached by any rotten oranges, meaning it's impossible to rot all the fresh oranges in the grid. This is likely due to the presence of isolated fresh oranges that are not adjacent to any rotten oranges and are surrounded by empty cells or other fresh oranges.\n\nGiven the grid configuration, the BFS approach correctly identifies that not all fresh oranges can be rotted, hence the result is `-1`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-1>>>"
