    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to model the spread of rot from rotten oranges to adjacent fresh oranges. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initialize Data Structures**:\n   - Create a queue to store the positions of all initially rotten oranges.\n   - Count the total number of fresh oranges.\n\n2. **Populate Initial Queue**:\n   - Traverse the grid and add all rotten oranges (value 2) to the queue.\n   - Count the number of fresh oranges (value 1).\n\n3. **BFS Process**:\n   - Initialize a variable `minutes` to track the time elapsed.\n   - While the queue is not empty and there are fresh oranges remaining:\n     - For each rotten orange in the queue, check its 4-directional neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n     - If a neighbor is a fresh orange, turn it rotten, decrease the fresh orange count, and add it to the queue.\n     - After processing all oranges in the current queue, increment the `minutes` counter.\n\n4. **Check for Remaining Fresh Oranges**:\n   - After the BFS completes, check if there are any fresh oranges left.\n   - If there are, return -1 as it's impossible to rot all oranges.\n   - Otherwise, return the `minutes` counter as the result.\n\n5. **Edge Cases**:\n   - If there are no fresh oranges initially, return 0 as no time is needed.\n   - If there are no rotten oranges initially and there are fresh oranges, return -1.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the given grid:\n\n- **Initial Setup**:\n  - Count fresh oranges and identify initial rotten oranges.\n  - Fresh oranges count: 168\n  - Initial rotten oranges positions: (0,0), (0,8), (0,10), (1,4), (3,9), (3,10), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,8), (6,11), (7,7), (8,4), (9,5), (9,9), (10,11), (10,12), (14,10), (15,2), (15,8)\n\n- **BFS Simulation**:\n  - Start BFS from the initial rotten oranges.\n  - Process each level of the queue, spreading rot to adjacent fresh oranges.\n  - Track the number of minutes elapsed.\n\n- **Result**:\n  - After simulating the process, all fresh oranges become rotten in 6 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange is:\n\n<<<6>>>"
