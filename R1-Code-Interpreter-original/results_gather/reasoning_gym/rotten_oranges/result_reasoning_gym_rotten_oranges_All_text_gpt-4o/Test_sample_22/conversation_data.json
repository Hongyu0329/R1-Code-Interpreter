    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to model the spread of rot from rotten oranges to adjacent fresh oranges. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initialize Data Structures:**\n   - Create a queue to keep track of rotten oranges and the time it takes for them to rot adjacent fresh oranges.\n   - Count the total number of fresh oranges initially present in the grid.\n\n2. **Populate Initial Queue:**\n   - Traverse the grid and add all initially rotten oranges (value 2) to the queue with a time of 0 minutes.\n   - Keep track of the number of fresh oranges (value 1) in the grid.\n\n3. **BFS Process:**\n   - While the queue is not empty, perform the following:\n     - Dequeue an element from the queue, which contains the position of a rotten orange and the time elapsed.\n     - For each of the four possible directions (up, down, left, right), check if there is a fresh orange adjacent to the current rotten orange.\n     - If a fresh orange is found, it becomes rotten, and we add it to the queue with the time incremented by 1 minute.\n     - Decrease the count of fresh oranges by 1 each time a fresh orange becomes rotten.\n\n4. **Check for Remaining Fresh Oranges:**\n   - After the BFS completes, check if there are any fresh oranges left in the grid.\n   - If there are fresh oranges remaining, it means not all fresh oranges can be reached by the rot, and we return -1.\n   - If no fresh oranges remain, the time recorded in the last processed element of the queue is the minimum time required for all oranges to rot.\n\n5. **Edge Cases:**\n   - If there are no fresh oranges initially, the answer is 0 because no time is needed for all oranges to rot.\n   - If there are no rotten oranges initially and there are fresh oranges, the answer is -1 because the fresh oranges can never rot.\n\nNow, applying this process to the given grid:\n\n- Start by identifying all the initial rotten oranges and their positions.\n- Use BFS to spread the rot to adjacent fresh oranges, keeping track of the time.\n- After processing all possible rotten oranges, check if any fresh oranges remain.\n\nAfter performing these steps on the provided grid, we find that all fresh oranges can be rotted in 5 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
