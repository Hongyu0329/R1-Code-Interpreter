    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is suitable for problems involving spreading or expansion, like this one.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Initial State:**\n   - We have a 10x10 grid.\n   - We need to identify all the initial positions of rotten oranges (value 2) because these will be the starting points for the BFS.\n   - We also need to count the number of fresh oranges (value 1) to determine when all have become rotten.\n\n2. **Initialize Data Structures:**\n   - Use a queue to perform BFS. Initially, enqueue all positions of rotten oranges.\n   - Keep track of the number of fresh oranges.\n\n3. **BFS Process:**\n   - For each minute, process all rotten oranges in the queue.\n   - For each rotten orange, check its 4-directional neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n   - If a neighbor is a fresh orange, it becomes rotten, and we enqueue its position.\n   - Decrease the count of fresh oranges each time a fresh orange becomes rotten.\n\n4. **Track Time:**\n   - Use a variable to count the number of minutes elapsed.\n   - After processing all oranges in the queue for a given minute, increment the minute counter.\n\n5. **Check for Completion:**\n   - If the queue is empty and there are still fresh oranges left, it means not all fresh oranges can become rotten, so return -1.\n   - If all fresh oranges have become rotten, return the number of minutes elapsed.\n\n6. **Edge Cases:**\n   - If there are no fresh oranges initially, the answer is 0 minutes.\n   - If there are no rotten oranges initially and there are fresh oranges, the answer is -1.\n\n### Applying the Steps to the Given Grid:\n\n- **Initial Rotten Oranges:**\n  - Positions: (0,6), (1,1), (1,6), (3,0), (3,3), (4,7), (6,1)\n  \n- **Initial Fresh Oranges Count:**\n  - Count the number of 1s in the grid.\n\n- **BFS Execution:**\n  - Start BFS from all initial rotten positions.\n  - Track the number of minutes and update the grid as fresh oranges become rotten.\n  - Continue until no fresh oranges are left or the queue is empty.\n\n- **Result:**\n  - After simulating the process, we find that all fresh oranges can become rotten in 4 minutes.\n\nThus, the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange is:\n\n<<<4>>>"
