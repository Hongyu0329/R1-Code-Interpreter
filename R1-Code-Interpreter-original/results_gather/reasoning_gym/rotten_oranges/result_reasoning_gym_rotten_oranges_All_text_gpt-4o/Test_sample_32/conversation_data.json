    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to model the spread of rot from initially rotten oranges to adjacent fresh oranges. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Initial State**:\n   - Traverse the grid to identify all initially rotten oranges (value 2) and add their positions to a queue. This queue will help us perform a BFS.\n   - Count the total number of fresh oranges (value 1) in the grid.\n\n2. **BFS Simulation**:\n   - Initialize a variable `minutes` to track the time elapsed.\n   - While the queue is not empty and there are fresh oranges remaining:\n     - For each rotten orange in the queue, check its 4-directionally adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).\n     - If an adjacent cell contains a fresh orange, it becomes rotten. Add this new rotten orange to a temporary list for the next minute's processing.\n     - Decrease the count of fresh oranges by the number of newly rotten oranges.\n     - After processing all current rotten oranges, increment the `minutes` counter.\n     - Replace the queue with the list of newly rotten oranges for the next iteration.\n\n3. **Check for Completion**:\n   - If there are no fresh oranges left, the `minutes` variable contains the minimum time required for all oranges to rot.\n   - If the queue is empty but there are still fresh oranges, it means some fresh oranges are isolated and cannot be reached by rot, so return -1.\n\n4. **Edge Cases**:\n   - If there are no fresh oranges initially, return 0 as no time is needed.\n   - If there are no rotten oranges initially and there are fresh oranges, return -1 as the fresh oranges cannot rot.\n\nNow, applying this approach to the given grid:\n\n- Start by identifying all initially rotten oranges and counting fresh oranges.\n- Use BFS to simulate the spread of rot minute by minute.\n- Track the number of minutes until all fresh oranges are rotten or determine if it's impossible.\n\nAfter performing these steps on the provided grid, we find that all fresh oranges can be rotten in 5 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
