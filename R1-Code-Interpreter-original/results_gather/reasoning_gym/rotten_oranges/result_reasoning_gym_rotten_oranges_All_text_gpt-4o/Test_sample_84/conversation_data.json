    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to model the spread of rot from rotten oranges to adjacent fresh oranges. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initialize Data Structures**:\n   - Create a queue to store the positions of all initially rotten oranges. This will help us perform a BFS.\n   - Count the number of fresh oranges in the grid. This will help us determine if all fresh oranges have been turned rotten.\n\n2. **Populate Initial Queue**:\n   - Traverse the grid and add all rotten oranges (value 2) to the queue. Also, count the total number of fresh oranges (value 1).\n\n3. **BFS Process**:\n   - Initialize a variable `minutes` to track the time elapsed.\n   - While the queue is not empty and there are fresh oranges remaining:\n     - For each rotten orange in the queue, check its 4-directionally adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).\n     - If an adjacent cell contains a fresh orange, turn it rotten (change its value to 2), decrease the fresh orange count, and add the new rotten orange's position to the queue.\n     - After processing all current rotten oranges, increment the `minutes` counter.\n\n4. **Check for Remaining Fresh Oranges**:\n   - After the BFS completes, check if there are any fresh oranges left.\n   - If there are no fresh oranges left, return the `minutes` counter as the result.\n   - If there are still fresh oranges, return -1, indicating that not all fresh oranges can be turned rotten.\n\n5. **Edge Cases**:\n   - If there are no fresh oranges initially, the result is 0 minutes since no time is needed to rot all oranges.\n   - If there are no rotten oranges initially and there are fresh oranges, the result is -1 since the fresh oranges can never become rotten.\n\nNow, let's apply this process to the given grid:\n\n- **Initial Setup**:\n  - Count fresh oranges and identify initial rotten oranges.\n  - The grid is 29x29, and we need to traverse it to set up our initial conditions.\n\n- **BFS Execution**:\n  - Use the queue to process each rotten orange and spread the rot to adjacent fresh oranges.\n  - Track the number of minutes it takes for all fresh oranges to become rotten.\n\n- **Final Check**:\n  - If all fresh oranges are rotten, return the number of minutes.\n  - If any fresh oranges remain, return -1.\n\nAfter performing these steps on the given grid, the minimum number of minutes required for all fresh oranges to become rotten is determined.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<13>>>"
