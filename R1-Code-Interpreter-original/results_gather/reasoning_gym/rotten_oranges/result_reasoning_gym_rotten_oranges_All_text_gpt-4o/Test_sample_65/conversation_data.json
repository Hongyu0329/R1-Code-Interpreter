    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is suitable for problems involving spreading or expansion, such as this one.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Conditions:**\n   - We have a grid of size 16x16.\n   - Each cell can be empty (0), have a fresh orange (1), or have a rotten orange (2).\n\n2. **Initialize Data Structures:**\n   - Use a queue to perform BFS. Initially, enqueue all rotten oranges (cells with value 2) along with their time of rotting (which is 0 at the start).\n   - Count the total number of fresh oranges.\n\n3. **BFS Process:**\n   - While the queue is not empty, process each rotten orange:\n     - Dequeue the current rotten orange and its time.\n     - For each of the four possible directions (up, down, left, right), check if there is a fresh orange adjacent to the current rotten orange.\n     - If a fresh orange is found, it becomes rotten, and we enqueue it with the time incremented by 1.\n     - Decrease the count of fresh oranges.\n\n4. **Check for Completion:**\n   - After processing all possible rotten oranges, check if there are any fresh oranges left.\n   - If there are no fresh oranges left, the last time incremented in the BFS process is the answer.\n   - If there are still fresh oranges left, it means some fresh oranges are isolated and cannot be reached by any rotten orange, so return -1.\n\n5. **Edge Cases:**\n   - If there are no fresh oranges initially, the answer is 0.\n   - If there are no rotten oranges initially and there are fresh oranges, the answer is -1.\n\n### Execution:\n\n- Start by enqueuing all rotten oranges with time 0.\n- Perform BFS, spreading the rot to adjacent fresh oranges and updating the time.\n- Keep track of the maximum time taken to rot all reachable fresh oranges.\n- If any fresh oranges remain unrotted, return -1.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nAfter simulating the process using the BFS approach, the minimum number of minutes required to rot all reachable fresh oranges in the given grid is determined. If any fresh oranges remain unrotted, it is impossible to rot all oranges.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
