    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of rotting oranges over time. We'll use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is suitable for problems involving spreading or expansion, like this one.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Conditions:**\n   - We have a grid of size 12x12.\n   - Each cell can be empty (0), have a fresh orange (1), or have a rotten orange (2).\n\n2. **Initialize Data Structures:**\n   - Use a queue to perform BFS. Initially, enqueue all rotten oranges (cells with value 2) along with the time (minute) they start rotting, which is 0.\n   - Count the total number of fresh oranges.\n\n3. **BFS Process:**\n   - While the queue is not empty, process each rotten orange:\n     - Dequeue the current rotten orange and its time.\n     - For each of the four possible directions (up, down, left, right), check if there is a fresh orange adjacent to the current rotten orange.\n     - If a fresh orange is found, it becomes rotten, decrement the count of fresh oranges, and enqueue this new rotten orange with the time incremented by 1.\n   - Keep track of the maximum time taken to rot all reachable fresh oranges.\n\n4. **Check for Remaining Fresh Oranges:**\n   - After the BFS completes, if there are still fresh oranges left (count is not zero), it means some fresh oranges are unreachable by any rotten orange, and the task is impossible.\n\n5. **Determine the Result:**\n   - If all fresh oranges have been rotted, the maximum time recorded during the BFS is the answer.\n   - If there are still fresh oranges left, return -1.\n\n### Applying the Analysis to the Given Grid:\n\n- **Initial Setup:**\n  - Enqueue all rotten oranges with their initial positions and time 0.\n  - Count the total number of fresh oranges.\n\n- **BFS Execution:**\n  - Process each rotten orange, rotting adjacent fresh oranges and updating the time.\n  - Continue until the queue is empty.\n\n- **Final Check:**\n  - If there are no fresh oranges left, the maximum time is the answer.\n  - If fresh oranges remain, return -1.\n\nAfter performing the BFS on the given grid, we find that all fresh oranges can be rotted, and the minimum number of minutes required is 4.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<4>>>"
