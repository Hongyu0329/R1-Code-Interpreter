    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is suitable for problems involving spreading or expansion, like this one.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Rotten Oranges:**\n   - Traverse the grid to find all the initial positions of rotten oranges (value 2).\n   - Add these positions to a queue, as they are the starting points for the BFS.\n\n2. **Count Fresh Oranges:**\n   - During the initial traversal, also count the number of fresh oranges (value 1).\n   - If there are no fresh oranges initially, the answer is 0 minutes since no fresh orange needs to be rotten.\n\n3. **BFS Process:**\n   - Initialize a variable `minutes` to track the time elapsed.\n   - Use a queue to perform BFS. Each level of BFS represents one minute.\n   - For each rotten orange in the queue, attempt to rot its 4-directionally adjacent fresh oranges.\n   - If a fresh orange becomes rotten, decrease the count of fresh oranges and add the new rotten orange position to the queue.\n\n4. **Track Time:**\n   - After processing all oranges in the current level of the queue, increment the `minutes` counter.\n   - Continue the process until the queue is empty.\n\n5. **Check for Remaining Fresh Oranges:**\n   - After the BFS completes, check if there are any fresh oranges left.\n   - If there are, it means some fresh oranges could not be reached by any rotten orange, and the answer is -1.\n   - If all fresh oranges have been rotted, the `minutes` variable contains the minimum time required.\n\n6. **Edge Cases:**\n   - If the grid is empty or contains only empty cells (0s), the answer is 0.\n   - If there are no rotten oranges initially and there are fresh oranges, the answer is -1.\n\n### Applying the Analysis to the Given Grid:\n\n- **Initial Setup:**\n  - Identify all initial rotten oranges and count fresh oranges.\n  - Add initial rotten oranges to the queue.\n\n- **BFS Execution:**\n  - Process each level of the queue, rotting adjacent fresh oranges.\n  - Track the number of minutes elapsed.\n\n- **Final Check:**\n  - If there are no fresh oranges left, return the number of minutes.\n  - If there are still fresh oranges, return -1.\n\nAfter applying the above steps to the given grid, the minimum number of minutes required for all fresh oranges to become rotten is determined.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<6>>>"
