    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to model the spread of rot from rotten oranges to adjacent fresh oranges. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initialize Data Structures**:\n   - Create a queue to store the positions of all initially rotten oranges.\n   - Count the total number of fresh oranges in the grid.\n\n2. **Enqueue Initial Rotten Oranges**:\n   - Traverse the grid and enqueue all cells containing a rotten orange (value 2).\n   - Keep track of the number of fresh oranges (value 1).\n\n3. **BFS to Spread Rot**:\n   - Use a BFS approach to simulate the spread of rot. For each rotten orange, check its 4-directionally adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).\n   - If an adjacent cell contains a fresh orange, it becomes rotten, and we enqueue this new rotten orange.\n   - Decrease the count of fresh oranges each time a fresh orange becomes rotten.\n\n4. **Track Time**:\n   - Use a variable to track the number of minutes (or levels in BFS) it takes for all fresh oranges to become rotten.\n   - Each level of BFS represents one minute passing.\n\n5. **Check for Remaining Fresh Oranges**:\n   - After the BFS completes, check if there are any fresh oranges left.\n   - If there are fresh oranges remaining, it means not all fresh oranges can become rotten, and we should return -1.\n\n6. **Return the Result**:\n   - If all fresh oranges have become rotten, return the number of minutes tracked.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the given grid:\n\n- **Initial Setup**:\n  - Enqueue all rotten oranges and count fresh oranges.\n  - Initial rotten oranges are at positions: (0,2), (0,7), (1,9), (1,14), (1,16), (2,1), (3,7), (3,14), (6,13), (7,7), (7,12), (8,7), (9,0), (9,7), (11,3), (11,15), (12,10), (12,14), (14,9), (15,7), (15,12), (15,14), (16,7).\n  - Total fresh oranges initially: 192.\n\n- **BFS Process**:\n  - Start BFS from all initial rotten oranges.\n  - Track the number of minutes as levels in BFS.\n  - Spread rot to adjacent fresh oranges and update the queue and fresh orange count.\n\n- **Result**:\n  - After simulating the process, all fresh oranges become rotten in 8 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange is:\n\n<<<8>>>"
