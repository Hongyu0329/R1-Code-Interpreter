    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is suitable for problems involving spreading or expansion, like this one.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Conditions:**\n   - We have a grid of size 11x11.\n   - Each cell can be empty (0), have a fresh orange (1), or have a rotten orange (2).\n\n2. **Initialize Data Structures:**\n   - Use a queue to keep track of all initially rotten oranges. This will help us perform the BFS.\n   - Count the number of fresh oranges at the start.\n\n3. **Populate Initial Queue:**\n   - Traverse the grid and add all rotten oranges (value 2) to the queue with their coordinates and the initial time (minute 0).\n   - Count the total number of fresh oranges.\n\n4. **BFS Process:**\n   - While the queue is not empty, process each rotten orange:\n     - For each rotten orange, check its 4-directional neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n     - If a neighbor is a fresh orange (value 1), it becomes rotten, and we add it to the queue with the incremented time.\n     - Decrease the count of fresh oranges each time a fresh orange becomes rotten.\n\n5. **Track Time:**\n   - Keep track of the time taken for each orange to become rotten. The time of the last orange to become rotten will be the answer.\n\n6. **Check for Remaining Fresh Oranges:**\n   - After processing all possible rotten oranges, check if there are any fresh oranges left.\n   - If there are, it means not all oranges can become rotten, and we return -1.\n\n7. **Return the Result:**\n   - If all fresh oranges have become rotten, return the time taken for the last orange to become rotten.\n\n### Execution:\n\n- Start with the initial rotten oranges:\n  - (0, 9), (1, 5), (1, 10), (2, 7), (3, 10), (4, 5), (5, 0), (5, 8), (7, 4), (9, 1)\n- Perform BFS from these positions, spreading the rot to adjacent fresh oranges.\n- Track the time taken for each spread.\n- After processing, check if any fresh oranges remain.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nAfter simulating the process, we find that all fresh oranges can be turned rotten in 5 minutes. Therefore, the minimum number of minutes required is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
