    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to model the spread of rot from initially rotten oranges to adjacent fresh oranges. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Initial State**:\n   - Traverse the grid to identify all initially rotten oranges (value 2) and count the number of fresh oranges (value 1).\n   - Store the positions of all rotten oranges in a queue, as these are the starting points for the BFS.\n\n2. **BFS Initialization**:\n   - Initialize a queue with the positions of all initially rotten oranges.\n   - Initialize a variable `minutes` to track the time elapsed.\n   - Initialize a variable `fresh_count` to track the number of fresh oranges.\n\n3. **BFS Process**:\n   - While the queue is not empty and there are fresh oranges remaining:\n     - For each rotten orange in the queue, check its 4-directionally adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).\n     - If an adjacent cell contains a fresh orange, turn it rotten, decrease the `fresh_count` by 1, and add the position of this newly rotten orange to the queue.\n     - After processing all oranges in the current level of the queue, increment the `minutes` by 1.\n\n4. **Check for Remaining Fresh Oranges**:\n   - After the BFS completes, check if there are any fresh oranges left (`fresh_count > 0`).\n   - If there are fresh oranges remaining, it means not all fresh oranges can be reached by the rot, so return -1.\n   - Otherwise, return the `minutes` as the total time taken for all oranges to become rotten.\n\n5. **Edge Cases**:\n   - If there are no fresh oranges initially, return 0 as no time is needed.\n   - If there are no rotten oranges initially and there are fresh oranges, return -1 as the fresh oranges can never become rotten.\n\nNow, applying this process to the given grid:\n\n- Start by identifying all initially rotten oranges and counting fresh oranges.\n- Use BFS to simulate the spread of rot, updating the grid and counting minutes.\n- After BFS, check if any fresh oranges remain.\n\nAfter performing these steps on the provided grid, we find that all fresh oranges can be turned rotten in 5 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
