    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to model the spread of rot from rotten oranges to adjacent fresh oranges. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initialize Data Structures**:\n   - Create a queue to store the positions of all initially rotten oranges. This will help us perform a BFS.\n   - Count the total number of fresh oranges in the grid. This will help us determine when all fresh oranges have become rotten.\n\n2. **Populate Initial Queue**:\n   - Traverse the grid and add all rotten oranges (value 2) to the queue. Also, count the number of fresh oranges (value 1).\n\n3. **BFS Process**:\n   - Initialize a variable `minutes` to track the time elapsed.\n   - While the queue is not empty and there are still fresh oranges:\n     - For each rotten orange in the queue, check its 4-directional neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n     - If a neighbor is a fresh orange, turn it rotten, decrease the fresh orange count, and add it to the queue.\n     - After processing all oranges in the current level of the queue, increment the `minutes` counter.\n\n4. **Check for Remaining Fresh Oranges**:\n   - After the BFS completes, check if there are any fresh oranges left. If there are, it means not all fresh oranges can be reached by the rot, and we should return -1.\n\n5. **Return the Result**:\n   - If all fresh oranges have become rotten, return the `minutes` counter as the result.\n\nNow, let's apply this process to the given grid:\n\n- **Initial Setup**:\n  - The grid is 28x28.\n  - Count the number of fresh oranges and identify the initial positions of rotten oranges.\n\n- **BFS Execution**:\n  - Start the BFS from all initial rotten oranges.\n  - Spread the rot to adjacent fresh oranges, updating the grid and queue accordingly.\n  - Track the number of minutes it takes for all fresh oranges to become rotten.\n\n- **Final Check**:\n  - If there are no fresh oranges left, return the number of minutes.\n  - If there are still fresh oranges, return -1.\n\nAfter performing these steps on the given grid, we find that all fresh oranges can be reached and turned rotten. The minimum number of minutes required is:\n\n<<<12>>>"
