    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to model the spread of rot from rotten oranges to adjacent fresh oranges. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Rotten Oranges**: \n   - Traverse the grid to find all the initial positions of rotten oranges (value 2). These will be our starting points for the BFS.\n\n2. **Count Fresh Oranges**:\n   - Count the total number of fresh oranges (value 1) in the grid. This will help us determine if all fresh oranges have been turned rotten by the end of the process.\n\n3. **BFS Initialization**:\n   - Use a queue to perform BFS. Initialize the queue with all the positions of the initial rotten oranges.\n   - Keep track of the time (in minutes) it takes for all fresh oranges to become rotten. Initialize this time to 0.\n\n4. **BFS Process**:\n   - While the queue is not empty, process each rotten orange in the queue:\n     - For each rotten orange, check its 4-directionally adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).\n     - If an adjacent cell contains a fresh orange, turn it rotten (change its value to 2), and add its position to the queue.\n     - Decrease the count of fresh oranges by 1 for each fresh orange that becomes rotten.\n   - After processing all oranges in the queue for a given minute, increment the time by 1.\n\n5. **Check Completion**:\n   - After the BFS completes, check if there are any fresh oranges left (i.e., if the count of fresh oranges is greater than 0).\n   - If there are no fresh oranges left, the time recorded is the minimum number of minutes required.\n   - If there are still fresh oranges left, it means some fresh oranges could not be reached by the rot, and the task is impossible.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - If all fresh oranges have become rotten, output the time taken.\n   - If not all fresh oranges can be turned rotten, output -1.\n\nApplying this process to the given grid, we find that all fresh oranges can be turned rotten, and the minimum number of minutes required is:\n\n<<<6>>>"
