    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to model the spread of rot from initially rotten oranges to adjacent fresh oranges. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Initial State**:\n   - Parse the grid to identify the positions of all initially rotten oranges (value 2) and count the total number of fresh oranges (value 1).\n\n2. **Initialize BFS**:\n   - Use a queue to perform BFS. Initially, enqueue all positions of rotten oranges along with a timestamp (minute) of 0, indicating they are rotten from the start.\n   - Keep track of the number of fresh oranges that need to be rotted.\n\n3. **BFS Process**:\n   - While the queue is not empty, dequeue an element which contains the position of a rotten orange and the current minute.\n   - For each rotten orange, check its 4-directionally adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).\n   - If an adjacent cell contains a fresh orange, rot it (change its value to 2), decrease the count of fresh oranges, and enqueue the new rotten orange position with the incremented minute.\n\n4. **Check for Completion**:\n   - Continue the BFS until the queue is empty.\n   - If all fresh oranges have been rotted by the end of the BFS, the last minute processed in the queue will be the answer.\n   - If there are still fresh oranges left after the BFS completes, it means some fresh oranges are isolated and cannot be rotted, so return -1.\n\n5. **Edge Cases**:\n   - If there are no fresh oranges initially, the answer is 0 because no time is needed to rot all oranges.\n   - If there are no rotten oranges initially and there are fresh oranges, return -1 because the fresh oranges cannot rot.\n\nNow, applying this process to the given grid:\n\n- Start by identifying all rotten oranges and counting fresh oranges.\n- Use BFS to simulate the rotting process minute by minute.\n- Track the maximum time taken to rot all reachable fresh oranges.\n- If any fresh oranges remain unrotted, return -1.\n\nAfter performing these steps on the provided grid, the minimum number of minutes required to rot all reachable fresh oranges is determined.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<5>>>"
