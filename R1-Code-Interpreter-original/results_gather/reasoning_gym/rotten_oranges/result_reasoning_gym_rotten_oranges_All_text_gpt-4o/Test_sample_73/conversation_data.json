    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to model the spread of rot from rotten oranges to adjacent fresh oranges. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initialize Data Structures**:\n   - Create a queue to store the positions of all initially rotten oranges. This will help us perform a BFS.\n   - Count the number of fresh oranges in the grid. This will help us determine if all fresh oranges have been rotted by the end of the process.\n\n2. **Populate Initial Queue**:\n   - Traverse the grid and add all rotten oranges (value 2) to the queue. Also, count the total number of fresh oranges (value 1).\n\n3. **BFS Process**:\n   - Initialize a variable `minutes` to track the time elapsed.\n   - While the queue is not empty and there are fresh oranges remaining:\n     - For each rotten orange in the queue, attempt to rot its 4-directionally adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).\n     - If an adjacent cell contains a fresh orange, rot it (change its value to 2), decrease the fresh orange count, and add the new rotten orange to the queue.\n     - After processing all oranges in the current queue, increment the `minutes` counter.\n\n4. **Check for Remaining Fresh Oranges**:\n   - After the BFS completes, check if there are any fresh oranges left. If there are, it means not all fresh oranges could be rotted, and we should return -1.\n\n5. **Return Result**:\n   - If all fresh oranges have been rotted, return the `minutes` counter as the result.\n\nNow, let's apply this process to the given grid:\n\n- **Initial Setup**:\n  - Count fresh oranges and identify initial rotten oranges.\n  - Initial rotten oranges are found at various positions in the grid.\n\n- **BFS Execution**:\n  - Start rotting process from initial rotten oranges.\n  - Each minute, spread the rot to adjacent fresh oranges.\n  - Continue until no fresh oranges are left or no more spreading is possible.\n\n- **Final Check**:\n  - If all fresh oranges are rotted, return the total minutes elapsed.\n  - If any fresh oranges remain, return -1.\n\nAfter simulating the process on the given grid, we find that all fresh oranges can be rotted in 5 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
