    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is suitable for problems involving spreading or expansion, like this one.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Rotten Oranges:**\n   - Traverse the grid to find all initially rotten oranges (value 2).\n   - Store their positions in a queue, as they will be the starting points for the BFS.\n\n2. **Count Fresh Oranges:**\n   - During the initial traversal, also count the number of fresh oranges (value 1).\n   - If there are no fresh oranges initially, the answer is 0 minutes since no fresh orange needs to be rotten.\n\n3. **BFS to Spread Rot:**\n   - Use a queue to perform BFS. Each level of BFS represents one minute passing.\n   - For each rotten orange, check its 4-directional neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n   - If a neighbor is a fresh orange, it becomes rotten, and we add it to the queue for the next level of BFS.\n   - Decrease the count of fresh oranges each time a fresh orange becomes rotten.\n\n4. **Track Time:**\n   - Keep track of the number of minutes (or levels in BFS) it takes for all fresh oranges to become rotten.\n   - If the queue is empty and there are still fresh oranges left, it means some fresh oranges are isolated and cannot be reached by any rotten orange. In this case, return -1.\n\n5. **Edge Cases:**\n   - If the grid is empty or contains only empty cells, the answer is 0.\n   - If there are no rotten oranges initially and there are fresh oranges, return -1 since they can never become rotten.\n\n### Execution on Given Grid:\n\n- **Initial Setup:**\n  - Identify all rotten oranges and add them to the queue.\n  - Count the total number of fresh oranges.\n\n- **BFS Execution:**\n  - Start BFS from all initially rotten oranges.\n  - For each rotten orange, attempt to rot adjacent fresh oranges.\n  - Track the number of minutes it takes for all fresh oranges to rot.\n\n- **Final Check:**\n  - If all fresh oranges are rotten by the end of BFS, return the number of minutes.\n  - If there are still fresh oranges left, return -1.\n\nAfter performing the above steps on the given grid, we find that all fresh oranges can be rotten in 4 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange is:\n\n<<<4>>>"
