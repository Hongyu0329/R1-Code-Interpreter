    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is suitable for problems involving spreading or expansion, like this one.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Conditions:**\n   - We have a grid of size 14x14.\n   - Each cell can be empty (0), have a fresh orange (1), or have a rotten orange (2).\n\n2. **Initialize Data Structures:**\n   - Use a queue to perform BFS. Initially, enqueue all the positions of rotten oranges (value 2) because they are the starting points for the spread of rot.\n   - Keep track of the number of fresh oranges.\n\n3. **BFS Process:**\n   - For each minute, process all the rotten oranges in the queue.\n   - For each rotten orange, check its 4-directional neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n   - If a neighbor is a fresh orange (value 1), it becomes rotten (change to 2), and we enqueue its position.\n   - Decrease the count of fresh oranges each time a fresh orange becomes rotten.\n\n4. **Count Minutes:**\n   - Each level of BFS represents one minute passing.\n   - Continue the process until there are no more fresh oranges or the queue is empty.\n\n5. **Check for Remaining Fresh Oranges:**\n   - If there are still fresh oranges left after the BFS completes, it means some fresh oranges are isolated and cannot be reached by any rotten orange. In this case, return -1.\n   - Otherwise, return the number of minutes elapsed.\n\n6. **Edge Cases:**\n   - If there are no fresh oranges initially, return 0.\n   - If there are no rotten oranges initially and there are fresh oranges, return -1.\n\n### Applying the Steps to the Given Grid:\n\n- **Initial Setup:**\n  - Enqueue all rotten oranges:\n    - Positions: (0, 11), (1, 4), (1, 10), (2, 0), (2, 2), (2, 5), (4, 3), (5, 12), (6, 5), (6, 9), (6, 10), (7, 6), (7, 11), (9, 9), (10, 12), (13, 0), (13, 5)\n  - Count fresh oranges: 128\n\n- **BFS Execution:**\n  - Minute 1: Process all initial rotten oranges, spread to adjacent fresh oranges, and update the queue.\n  - Continue this process, incrementing the minute count each time a full level of BFS is processed.\n\n- **Final Check:**\n  - After processing, check if any fresh oranges remain.\n  - If none remain, the last minute count is the answer.\n  - If any remain, return -1.\n\nAfter simulating the process, we find that all fresh oranges can be reached and turned rotten in 8 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange is:\n\n<<<8>>>"
