    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to model the spread of rot from rotten oranges to adjacent fresh oranges. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initialize Data Structures**:\n   - Create a queue to keep track of rotten oranges and the time it takes for them to rot adjacent fresh oranges.\n   - Count the number of fresh oranges initially present in the grid.\n\n2. **Populate Initial Queue**:\n   - Traverse the grid and add all initially rotten oranges (value 2) to the queue with a time of 0 minutes.\n   - Count the total number of fresh oranges (value 1) in the grid.\n\n3. **BFS Process**:\n   - Use a BFS approach to process each rotten orange in the queue.\n   - For each rotten orange, check its 4-directionally adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).\n   - If an adjacent cell contains a fresh orange, rot it (change its value to 2), decrease the fresh orange count, and add it to the queue with an incremented time.\n\n4. **Track Time**:\n   - Keep track of the maximum time taken to rot all reachable fresh oranges.\n\n5. **Check for Remaining Fresh Oranges**:\n   - After processing all rotten oranges in the queue, check if there are any fresh oranges left.\n   - If there are fresh oranges that could not be reached by any rotten orange, return -1 as it is impossible to rot all oranges.\n   - Otherwise, return the maximum time recorded.\n\n6. **Edge Cases**:\n   - If there are no fresh oranges initially, return 0 as no time is needed.\n   - If there are no rotten oranges initially and there are fresh oranges, return -1 as they cannot rot.\n\nNow, applying this process to the given grid:\n\n- Start by identifying all initial rotten oranges and their positions.\n- Use BFS to spread the rot to adjacent fresh oranges, keeping track of the time.\n- Continue the process until no more fresh oranges can be rotted.\n- Check if any fresh oranges remain unrotted.\n\nAfter performing these steps on the provided grid, the minimum number of minutes required to rot all fresh oranges is determined.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<4>>>."
