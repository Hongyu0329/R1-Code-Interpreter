    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to model the spread of rot from rotten oranges to adjacent fresh oranges. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Initial State**:\n   - Traverse the grid to identify all initially rotten oranges (value 2) and add their positions to a queue. This queue will help us perform a BFS.\n   - Count the total number of fresh oranges (value 1) in the grid.\n\n2. **BFS Initialization**:\n   - Initialize a variable `minutes` to 0, which will keep track of the time elapsed.\n   - Use a queue to perform BFS, starting with all initially rotten oranges.\n\n3. **BFS Process**:\n   - While the queue is not empty and there are still fresh oranges:\n     - For each rotten orange in the queue, check its 4-directionally adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).\n     - If an adjacent cell contains a fresh orange, it becomes rotten. Add this newly rotten orange to the queue for the next round of BFS.\n     - Decrease the count of fresh oranges by 1 for each fresh orange that becomes rotten.\n   - After processing all oranges in the current queue, increment the `minutes` counter by 1.\n\n4. **Check for Remaining Fresh Oranges**:\n   - If there are no fresh oranges left, the `minutes` counter will represent the minimum time required for all oranges to become rotten.\n   - If there are still fresh oranges left after the BFS completes, it means some fresh oranges are isolated and cannot be reached by any rotten orange. In this case, return -1.\n\n5. **Edge Cases**:\n   - If there are no fresh oranges to begin with, the answer is 0 because no time is needed for all oranges to become rotten.\n\nNow, applying this process to the given grid:\n\n- Start by identifying all initially rotten oranges and counting fresh oranges.\n- Perform BFS to spread the rot from initially rotten oranges to adjacent fresh oranges.\n- Track the time taken for all fresh oranges to become rotten.\n- If any fresh oranges remain isolated, return -1.\n\nAfter simulating the process on the given grid, we find that all fresh oranges can be reached and turned rotten in 6 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange is:\n\n<<<6>>>"
