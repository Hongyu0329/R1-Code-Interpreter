    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is suitable for problems involving spreading or expansion, like this one.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Rotten Oranges:**\n   - Traverse the grid to find all the initial positions of rotten oranges (value 2).\n   - Add these positions to a queue, as they will be the starting points for the BFS.\n\n2. **Count Fresh Oranges:**\n   - During the initial traversal, also count the number of fresh oranges (value 1).\n   - If there are no fresh oranges initially, the answer is 0 minutes since no fresh orange needs to rot.\n\n3. **BFS Initialization:**\n   - Initialize a variable `minutes` to 0 to keep track of the time elapsed.\n   - Use a queue to perform BFS, starting with all initially rotten oranges.\n\n4. **BFS Process:**\n   - While the queue is not empty and there are fresh oranges remaining:\n     - For each rotten orange in the queue, check its 4-directional neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n     - If a neighbor is a fresh orange, it becomes rotten, and we add it to the queue.\n     - Decrease the count of fresh oranges by 1 for each newly rotten orange.\n   - After processing all oranges in the current level of the queue, increment the `minutes` counter.\n\n5. **Check for Remaining Fresh Oranges:**\n   - After the BFS completes, check if there are any fresh oranges left.\n   - If there are, it means some fresh oranges could not be reached by any rotten orange, so return -1.\n   - Otherwise, return the `minutes` counter as the result.\n\n6. **Edge Cases:**\n   - If the grid is empty or contains only empty cells, the answer is 0.\n   - If there are no rotten oranges initially and there are fresh oranges, return -1.\n\n### Applying the Analysis to the Given Grid:\n\n- **Initial Rotten Oranges:**\n  - Identify all positions with value 2 and add them to the queue.\n  - For the given grid, the initial rotten oranges are at positions: (0,4), (0,9), (2,8), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (4,9), (6,10), (7,2), (8,6), (9,9), (10,10).\n\n- **Count Fresh Oranges:**\n  - Count all positions with value 1.\n\n- **BFS Execution:**\n  - Start BFS from all initial rotten oranges.\n  - Spread the rot to adjacent fresh oranges, updating the queue and decrementing the fresh orange count.\n  - Increment the `minutes` counter after each level of BFS.\n\n- **Final Check:**\n  - After BFS, check if any fresh oranges remain.\n  - If none remain, the `minutes` counter gives the answer.\n\nAfter performing the BFS on the given grid, the minimum number of minutes required for all fresh oranges to rot is determined.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<4>>>."
