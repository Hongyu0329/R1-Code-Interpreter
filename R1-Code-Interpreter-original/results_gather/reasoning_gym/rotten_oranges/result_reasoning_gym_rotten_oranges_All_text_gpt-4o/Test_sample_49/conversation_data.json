    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to model the spread of rot from rotten oranges to adjacent fresh oranges. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initialize Data Structures**:\n   - Create a queue to store the positions of all initially rotten oranges. This will help us perform a BFS.\n   - Count the number of fresh oranges in the grid. This will help us determine if all fresh oranges have been rotted by the end of the process.\n\n2. **Populate Initial Queue**:\n   - Traverse the grid and add all rotten oranges (value 2) to the queue along with an initial time of 0 minutes.\n   - Count all fresh oranges (value 1) during this traversal.\n\n3. **BFS to Spread Rot**:\n   - Use a BFS to simulate the spread of rot. For each rotten orange, check its 4-directional neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n   - If a neighbor is a fresh orange, it becomes rotten, and we add it to the queue with the time incremented by 1 minute.\n   - Decrease the count of fresh oranges each time a fresh orange becomes rotten.\n\n4. **Track Time**:\n   - Keep track of the maximum time taken to rot all reachable fresh oranges. This will be the answer if all fresh oranges can be rotted.\n\n5. **Check for Remaining Fresh Oranges**:\n   - After the BFS completes, check if there are any fresh oranges left. If there are, it means some fresh oranges are unreachable by any rotten orange, and the answer is -1.\n\n6. **Return the Result**:\n   - If all fresh oranges have been rotted, return the maximum time recorded during the BFS.\n   - If not all fresh oranges can be rotted, return -1.\n\nNow, applying this process to the given grid:\n\n- We start by identifying all the initial rotten oranges and counting the fresh ones.\n- We perform a BFS from each rotten orange, spreading the rot to adjacent fresh oranges and updating the time.\n- We continue this process until no more fresh oranges can be rotted.\n- Finally, we check if any fresh oranges remain. If they do, the answer is -1. Otherwise, the answer is the maximum time recorded.\n\nAfter performing these steps on the provided grid, the minimum number of minutes required to rot all reachable fresh oranges is determined.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<6>>>"
