    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to model the spread of rot from initially rotten oranges to adjacent fresh oranges. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Initial State**:\n   - Traverse the grid to identify all initially rotten oranges (value 2) and add their positions to a queue. This queue will help us perform a BFS.\n   - Count the number of fresh oranges (value 1) in the grid. If there are no fresh oranges, the answer is 0 minutes since all oranges are already rotten.\n\n2. **BFS Simulation**:\n   - Initialize a variable `minutes` to 0 to keep track of the time elapsed.\n   - While the queue is not empty and there are fresh oranges remaining:\n     - For each rotten orange in the queue, check its 4-directional neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n     - If a neighbor is a fresh orange, it becomes rotten, and we add its position to a temporary queue for the next minute.\n     - Decrease the count of fresh oranges each time a fresh orange becomes rotten.\n   - After processing all rotten oranges for the current minute, increment the `minutes` counter and replace the main queue with the temporary queue.\n\n3. **Check for Remaining Fresh Oranges**:\n   - After the BFS completes, check if there are any fresh oranges left. If there are, it means not all fresh oranges can be reached by the rot, and the answer is -1.\n   - If there are no fresh oranges left, the `minutes` variable contains the minimum number of minutes required for all oranges to become rotten.\n\n4. **Edge Cases**:\n   - If the grid is empty or contains only empty cells (value 0), the answer is 0.\n   - If there are no initially rotten oranges and there are fresh oranges, the answer is -1 since the fresh oranges can never become rotten.\n\nNow, applying this approach to the given grid:\n\n- Start by identifying all initially rotten oranges and counting fresh oranges.\n- Perform BFS to simulate the spread of rot.\n- Track the number of minutes and check if all fresh oranges can be reached.\n\nAfter performing these steps on the provided grid, we find that the minimum number of minutes required for all fresh oranges to become rotten is 5.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
