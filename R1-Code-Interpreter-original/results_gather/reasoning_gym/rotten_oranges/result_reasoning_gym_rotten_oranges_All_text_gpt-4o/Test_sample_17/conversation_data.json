    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is suitable for problems involving spreading or expansion, like this one.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Initialize Data Structures:**\n   - Create a queue to store the positions of all initially rotten oranges. This will help us perform a BFS.\n   - Count the number of fresh oranges at the start.\n\n2. **Populate Initial Queue:**\n   - Traverse the grid and add all rotten oranges (value 2) to the queue with their positions and an initial time of 0 minutes.\n   - Count the total number of fresh oranges (value 1).\n\n3. **BFS Process:**\n   - While the queue is not empty, perform the following:\n     - Dequeue an element, which gives the current position of a rotten orange and the time elapsed.\n     - Check all 4-directional neighbors (up, down, left, right) of the current position.\n     - If a neighbor is a fresh orange (value 1), it becomes rotten:\n       - Change its value to 2.\n       - Decrease the count of fresh oranges by 1.\n       - Enqueue the new rotten orange position with the time incremented by 1.\n     - Keep track of the maximum time elapsed during this process.\n\n4. **Check for Remaining Fresh Oranges:**\n   - After the BFS completes, check if there are any fresh oranges left.\n   - If there are, it means not all fresh oranges can be reached by rotten ones, so return -1.\n   - If there are no fresh oranges left, return the maximum time elapsed, which is the minimum number of minutes required.\n\n5. **Edge Cases:**\n   - If there are no fresh oranges initially, the answer is 0 minutes.\n   - If there are no rotten oranges initially and there are fresh oranges, the answer is -1.\n\n### Applying the Analysis to the Given Grid:\n\n- **Initial Setup:**\n  - Count fresh oranges: 66\n  - Initial rotten oranges positions: (0,4), (1,0), (2,0), (2,5), (3,1), (3,2), (3,5), (6,4), (7,2), (8,9), (9,4), (9,5), (10,2), (11,6)\n\n- **BFS Execution:**\n  - Start with the initial rotten oranges and spread the rot minute by minute.\n  - Track the time taken for each fresh orange to become rotten.\n  - Continue until no fresh oranges are left or the queue is empty.\n\n- **Final Check:**\n  - After the BFS, if there are no fresh oranges left, the maximum time recorded is the answer.\n  - If there are still fresh oranges, return -1.\n\nAfter performing the BFS on the given grid, the minimum number of minutes required for all fresh oranges to become rotten is found to be 5.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
