    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to model the spread of rot from initially rotten oranges to adjacent fresh oranges. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Initial State:**\n   - Traverse the grid to identify all initially rotten oranges (value 2) and add their positions to a queue. This queue will help us perform a BFS.\n   - Count the total number of fresh oranges (value 1) in the grid.\n\n2. **BFS Simulation:**\n   - Initialize a variable `minutes` to track the time elapsed.\n   - While the queue is not empty and there are fresh oranges remaining:\n     - For each rotten orange in the queue, check its 4-directionally adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).\n     - If an adjacent cell contains a fresh orange, it becomes rotten. Add this new rotten orange to the queue and decrease the count of fresh oranges.\n     - After processing all oranges in the current queue, increment the `minutes` counter.\n\n3. **Check for Remaining Fresh Oranges:**\n   - If there are no fresh oranges left, the `minutes` variable will represent the minimum time required for all oranges to become rotten.\n   - If there are still fresh oranges remaining after the queue is empty, it means some fresh oranges are isolated and cannot be reached by any rotten orange. In this case, return -1.\n\n4. **Edge Cases:**\n   - If there are no fresh oranges initially, the answer is 0 because no time is needed for all oranges to become rotten.\n   - If there are no rotten oranges initially and there are fresh oranges, the answer is -1 because the fresh oranges can never become rotten.\n\nNow, applying this approach to the given grid:\n\n- Start by identifying all initially rotten oranges and counting fresh oranges.\n- Perform BFS to simulate the spread of rot.\n- Track the number of minutes and check if all fresh oranges can be turned rotten.\n\nAfter performing these steps on the provided grid, the minimum number of minutes required for all fresh oranges to become rotten is determined.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<4>>>"
