    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to model the spread of rot from rotten oranges to adjacent fresh oranges. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Initial State**:\n   - Traverse the grid to identify all the initial positions of rotten oranges (value 2).\n   - Count the total number of fresh oranges (value 1) in the grid.\n\n2. **Initialize BFS**:\n   - Use a queue to perform BFS. Initially, enqueue all the positions of rotten oranges.\n   - Keep track of the number of minutes elapsed, starting from 0.\n\n3. **BFS Process**:\n   - For each minute, process all the rotten oranges in the queue.\n   - For each rotten orange, check its 4-directional neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n   - If a neighbor is a fresh orange, it becomes rotten, and we enqueue its position.\n   - Decrease the count of fresh oranges each time a fresh orange becomes rotten.\n\n4. **Check for Completion**:\n   - After processing all rotten oranges for a minute, increment the minute counter.\n   - If there are no fresh oranges left, the process is complete, and the current minute count is the answer.\n   - If the queue is empty but there are still fresh oranges, it means some fresh oranges cannot be reached by any rotten orange, and the answer is -1.\n\n5. **Edge Cases**:\n   - If there are no fresh oranges initially, the answer is 0 because no time is needed.\n   - If there are no rotten oranges initially and there are fresh oranges, the answer is -1 because the fresh oranges can never become rotten.\n\nNow, let's apply this process to the given grid:\n\n- **Initial Setup**:\n  - Count the number of fresh oranges and identify the positions of all rotten oranges.\n  - Enqueue all rotten orange positions.\n\n- **Simulate the Process**:\n  - Use BFS to spread the rot from rotten oranges to adjacent fresh oranges.\n  - Track the number of minutes and update the count of fresh oranges.\n\n- **Determine the Result**:\n  - If all fresh oranges become rotten, return the number of minutes.\n  - If there are still fresh oranges left after the BFS completes, return -1.\n\nAfter applying the above steps to the given grid, the minimum number of minutes required for all fresh oranges to become rotten is determined.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<6>>>"
