    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to model the spread of rot from rotten oranges to adjacent fresh oranges. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initialize Data Structures**:\n   - Create a queue to store the positions of all initially rotten oranges. This will help us perform a BFS.\n   - Count the number of fresh oranges in the grid. This will help us determine if all fresh oranges have become rotten.\n\n2. **Enqueue Initial Rotten Oranges**:\n   - Traverse the grid and enqueue all positions of rotten oranges (value 2) into the queue.\n   - Count the total number of fresh oranges (value 1) in the grid.\n\n3. **BFS to Spread Rot**:\n   - Initialize a variable `minutes` to track the time elapsed.\n   - While the queue is not empty and there are fresh oranges remaining:\n     - For each rotten orange in the queue, check its 4-directionally adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).\n     - If an adjacent cell contains a fresh orange, turn it rotten (change its value to 2), decrease the fresh orange count, and enqueue its position.\n     - After processing all rotten oranges at the current minute, increment the `minutes` counter.\n\n4. **Check for Remaining Fresh Oranges**:\n   - After the BFS completes, check if there are any fresh oranges left.\n   - If there are no fresh oranges left, return the `minutes` counter as the result.\n   - If there are still fresh oranges, return -1, indicating that not all fresh oranges can become rotten.\n\n5. **Edge Cases**:\n   - If there are no fresh oranges initially, the answer is 0 because no time is needed for all oranges to become rotten.\n   - If there are no rotten oranges initially and there are fresh oranges, the answer is -1 because the fresh oranges can never become rotten.\n\nNow, applying this approach to the given grid:\n\n- We start by identifying all the initial rotten oranges and counting the fresh oranges.\n- We perform a BFS to simulate the spread of rot, updating the grid and counting the minutes.\n- After the BFS, we check if any fresh oranges remain.\n\nAfter performing these steps on the provided grid, we find that all fresh oranges can become rotten in 5 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
