    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to model the spread of rot from initially rotten oranges to adjacent fresh oranges. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Initial State:**\n   - Traverse the grid to identify all initially rotten oranges (value 2) and count the total number of fresh oranges (value 1).\n   - Store the positions of all rotten oranges in a queue, as they will be the starting points for the BFS.\n\n2. **BFS Simulation:**\n   - Initialize a variable `minutes` to track the time elapsed.\n   - While there are rotten oranges in the queue and fresh oranges remaining:\n     - For each rotten orange in the queue, check its 4-directional neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n     - If a neighbor is a fresh orange, it becomes rotten, and we add its position to the queue for the next minute's processing.\n     - Decrease the count of fresh oranges each time a fresh orange becomes rotten.\n     - After processing all rotten oranges for the current minute, increment the `minutes` counter.\n\n3. **Check for Remaining Fresh Oranges:**\n   - If there are no fresh oranges left, the `minutes` counter will give the minimum time required for all oranges to rot.\n   - If there are still fresh oranges left after the BFS completes, it means some fresh oranges are isolated and cannot be reached by any rotten orange, so return -1.\n\n4. **Edge Cases:**\n   - If there are no fresh oranges initially, the answer is 0 minutes.\n   - If there are no rotten oranges initially and there are fresh oranges, the answer is -1.\n\nNow, applying this approach to the given grid:\n\n- Start by identifying all rotten oranges and counting fresh oranges.\n- Use BFS to simulate the spread of rot minute by minute.\n- After processing, check if any fresh oranges remain.\n\nAfter performing these steps on the provided grid, the minimum number of minutes required for all fresh oranges to rot is determined to be:\n\n<<<13>>>"
