    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to model the spread of rot from initially rotten oranges to adjacent fresh oranges. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Initial State**:\n   - Traverse the grid to identify all initially rotten oranges (value 2) and add their positions to a queue. This queue will help us perform a BFS.\n   - Count the total number of fresh oranges (value 1) in the grid.\n\n2. **BFS Simulation**:\n   - Initialize a variable `minutes` to track the time elapsed.\n   - While the queue is not empty and there are fresh oranges remaining:\n     - For each rotten orange in the queue, check its 4-directional neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n     - If a neighbor is a fresh orange, it becomes rotten, and we add its position to a temporary queue for the next minute's processing.\n     - Decrease the count of fresh oranges each time a fresh orange becomes rotten.\n     - After processing all oranges in the current queue, increment the `minutes` counter and replace the queue with the temporary queue.\n\n3. **Check for Remaining Fresh Oranges**:\n   - After the BFS completes, check if there are any fresh oranges left.\n   - If there are fresh oranges remaining, it means not all fresh oranges can be reached by the rot, and we return -1.\n   - If no fresh oranges remain, return the `minutes` counter as the result.\n\n4. **Edge Cases**:\n   - If there are no fresh oranges initially, the answer is 0 because no time is needed for all oranges to become rotten.\n   - If there are no rotten oranges initially and there are fresh oranges, the answer is -1 because the fresh oranges can never become rotten.\n\nNow, applying this approach to the given grid:\n\n- We start by identifying all initially rotten oranges and counting fresh oranges.\n- We perform BFS to simulate the spread of rot, updating the grid and counting minutes.\n- After the BFS, we check if any fresh oranges remain.\n\nAfter performing these steps on the provided grid, we find that all fresh oranges can be reached and become rotten in 6 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange is:\n\n<<<6>>>"
