    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to model the spread of rot from rotten oranges to adjacent fresh oranges. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Conditions:**\n   - We have a grid of size 22x22.\n   - Each cell can be empty (0), have a fresh orange (1), or have a rotten orange (2).\n\n2. **Initialize Data Structures:**\n   - Use a queue to keep track of all initially rotten oranges. Each entry in the queue will be a tuple containing the coordinates of the rotten orange and the time (in minutes) since it became rotten.\n   - Count the total number of fresh oranges at the start.\n\n3. **BFS Setup:**\n   - Enqueue all initially rotten oranges with a time of 0 minutes.\n   - Keep track of the maximum time taken to rot all reachable fresh oranges.\n\n4. **BFS Execution:**\n   - While the queue is not empty, dequeue an element which gives the current position of a rotten orange and the time.\n   - For each rotten orange, check its 4-directionally adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).\n   - If an adjacent cell contains a fresh orange, rot it (change its value to 2), decrease the count of fresh oranges, and enqueue the new rotten orange with the incremented time.\n   - Update the maximum time taken to rot oranges.\n\n5. **Check for Remaining Fresh Oranges:**\n   - After the BFS completes, check if there are any fresh oranges left.\n   - If there are, it means some fresh oranges are unreachable by any rotten orange, so return -1.\n   - Otherwise, return the maximum time recorded during the BFS as the minimum number of minutes required.\n\n6. **Edge Cases:**\n   - If there are no fresh oranges initially, the answer is 0 minutes.\n   - If there are no rotten oranges initially and there are fresh oranges, the answer is -1.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the minimum number of minutes required for all fresh oranges to become rotten, or determine if it's impossible.\n\nAfter applying this approach to the given grid, the minimum number of minutes required is:\n\n<<<6>>>"
