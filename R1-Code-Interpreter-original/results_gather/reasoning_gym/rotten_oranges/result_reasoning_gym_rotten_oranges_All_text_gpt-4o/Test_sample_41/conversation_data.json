    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of rotting oranges over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to model the spread of rot from rotten oranges to adjacent fresh oranges. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Initial State**: \n   - Traverse the grid to identify all the initial positions of rotten oranges (value 2) and count the number of fresh oranges (value 1).\n   - Store the positions of rotten oranges in a queue to facilitate the BFS process.\n\n2. **BFS Process**:\n   - Initialize a variable `minutes` to track the time elapsed.\n   - While the queue is not empty and there are fresh oranges remaining:\n     - For each rotten orange in the queue, check its 4-directional neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n     - If a neighbor is a fresh orange, it becomes rotten, and we add its position to the queue.\n     - Decrease the count of fresh oranges each time a fresh orange becomes rotten.\n     - After processing all rotten oranges in the queue for the current minute, increment the `minutes` counter.\n\n3. **Check for Remaining Fresh Oranges**:\n   - After the BFS completes, check if there are any fresh oranges left.\n   - If there are fresh oranges remaining, it means not all oranges can be rotten, and we should return -1.\n\n4. **Return the Result**:\n   - If all fresh oranges have become rotten, return the `minutes` counter as the result.\n\nNow, let's apply this process to the given grid:\n\n- **Initial Setup**:\n  - Count the number of fresh oranges and identify the initial positions of rotten oranges.\n  - There are multiple rotten oranges scattered throughout the grid.\n\n- **BFS Execution**:\n  - Start the BFS from all initial rotten oranges simultaneously.\n  - Spread the rot to adjacent fresh oranges minute by minute.\n  - Track the number of minutes it takes for all fresh oranges to become rotten.\n\n- **Final Check**:\n  - After the BFS completes, check if there are any fresh oranges left.\n  - If no fresh oranges remain, the `minutes` counter gives the minimum time required.\n\nAfter simulating the process on the given grid, we find that all fresh oranges can be rotten in 5 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
