    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to model the spread of rot from rotten oranges to adjacent fresh oranges. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initialize Data Structures**:\n   - Create a queue to store the positions of all initially rotten oranges. This will help us perform a BFS.\n   - Count the total number of fresh oranges in the grid.\n\n2. **BFS Setup**:\n   - For each rotten orange, add its position to the queue along with an initial time of 0 minutes.\n   - Define the possible directions for spreading the rot: up, down, left, and right.\n\n3. **BFS Execution**:\n   - While the queue is not empty, perform the following:\n     - Dequeue an element, which gives the current position of a rotten orange and the time elapsed.\n     - For each of the four possible directions, calculate the new position.\n     - Check if the new position is within the grid bounds and contains a fresh orange.\n     - If it does, turn the fresh orange into a rotten one, decrease the count of fresh oranges, and enqueue the new position with the time incremented by 1.\n     - Keep track of the maximum time taken to rot all reachable fresh oranges.\n\n4. **Check for Remaining Fresh Oranges**:\n   - After the BFS completes, check if there are any fresh oranges left.\n   - If there are, it means some fresh oranges are unreachable by any rotten orange, and the task is impossible. Return -1.\n   - If there are no fresh oranges left, return the maximum time recorded during the BFS as the minimum number of minutes required.\n\n5. **Edge Cases**:\n   - If there are no fresh oranges initially, return 0 as no time is needed.\n   - If there are no rotten oranges initially and there are fresh oranges, return -1 as the fresh oranges can never rot.\n\nNow, applying this approach to the given grid:\n\n- Initialize the queue with all rotten oranges and count the fresh oranges.\n- Perform BFS to spread the rot and track the time.\n- After BFS, check if any fresh oranges remain.\n\nAfter executing these steps on the provided grid, we find that all fresh oranges can be rotted in 5 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
