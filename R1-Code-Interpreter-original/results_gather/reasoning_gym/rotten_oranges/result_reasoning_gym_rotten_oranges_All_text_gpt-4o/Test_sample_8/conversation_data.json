    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to model the spread of rot from initially rotten oranges to adjacent fresh oranges. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Conditions:**\n   - We have a grid of size 24x24.\n   - Each cell can be empty (0), contain a fresh orange (1), or contain a rotten orange (2).\n\n2. **Initialize Data Structures:**\n   - Use a queue to perform BFS. Initially, enqueue all positions of rotten oranges (value 2) along with a timestamp (minute 0).\n   - Count the total number of fresh oranges (value 1) in the grid.\n\n3. **BFS Process:**\n   - While the queue is not empty, perform the following:\n     - Dequeue an element, which contains the position of a rotten orange and the current minute.\n     - For each of the four possible directions (up, down, left, right), check if the adjacent cell contains a fresh orange.\n     - If an adjacent cell contains a fresh orange, rot it (change its value to 2), decrease the count of fresh oranges, and enqueue the new position with the incremented minute.\n   - Keep track of the maximum minute value encountered during the BFS, as this represents the time taken for the last fresh orange to rot.\n\n4. **Check for Remaining Fresh Oranges:**\n   - After the BFS completes, check if there are any fresh oranges left (i.e., if the count of fresh oranges is greater than zero).\n   - If there are fresh oranges left, it means not all oranges can be rotted, and we should return -1.\n\n5. **Return the Result:**\n   - If all fresh oranges have been rotted, return the maximum minute value encountered during the BFS.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the minimum number of minutes required for all fresh oranges to become rotten, or determine if it is impossible.\n\nAfter applying the above steps to the given grid, the minimum number of minutes required is:\n\n<<<6>>>"
