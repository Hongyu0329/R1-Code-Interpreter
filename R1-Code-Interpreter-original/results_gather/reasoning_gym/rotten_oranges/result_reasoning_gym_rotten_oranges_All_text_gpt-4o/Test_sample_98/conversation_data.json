    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to model the spread of rot from initially rotten oranges to adjacent fresh oranges. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Conditions:**\n   - We have a grid of size 26x26.\n   - Each cell can be empty (0), contain a fresh orange (1), or contain a rotten orange (2).\n\n2. **Initialize Data Structures:**\n   - Use a queue to perform BFS. Initially, enqueue all positions of rotten oranges (value 2) along with a timestamp (minute 0).\n   - Count the total number of fresh oranges (value 1) in the grid.\n\n3. **BFS Simulation:**\n   - While the queue is not empty, process each rotten orange:\n     - Dequeue the current position and time.\n     - For each of the four possible directions (up, down, left, right), check if the adjacent cell contains a fresh orange.\n     - If a fresh orange is found, it becomes rotten, decrement the count of fresh oranges, and enqueue the new rotten orange position with the incremented time.\n   - Keep track of the maximum time taken to rot all reachable fresh oranges.\n\n4. **Determine the Result:**\n   - If there are no fresh oranges left after the BFS completes, the maximum time recorded is the answer.\n   - If there are still fresh oranges remaining, it means some fresh oranges are unreachable by any rotten orange, and the answer is -1.\n\n5. **Edge Cases:**\n   - If there are no fresh oranges initially, the answer is 0.\n   - If there are no rotten oranges initially and there are fresh oranges, the answer is -1.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the minimum number of minutes required for all fresh oranges to become rotten or conclude that it's impossible.\n\nAfter applying this approach to the given grid, the final answer is:\n\n<<<6>>>"
