    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to model the spread of rot from initially rotten oranges to adjacent fresh oranges. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Initial State**:\n   - We need to identify all the initially rotten oranges (value 2) and add their positions to a queue. This queue will help us perform a BFS to spread the rot.\n   - We also need to count the number of fresh oranges (value 1) at the start.\n\n2. **BFS Initialization**:\n   - Initialize a queue with all the positions of the rotten oranges.\n   - Initialize a variable `minutes` to keep track of the time elapsed.\n   - Initialize a variable `fresh_count` to keep track of the number of fresh oranges.\n\n3. **BFS Process**:\n   - While the queue is not empty and there are fresh oranges remaining:\n     - For each rotten orange in the queue, check its 4-directional neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n     - If a neighbor is a fresh orange, it becomes rotten, and we add its position to the queue.\n     - Decrease the `fresh_count` by 1 for each fresh orange that becomes rotten.\n     - After processing all oranges in the current level of the queue, increment the `minutes` by 1.\n\n4. **Check for Remaining Fresh Oranges**:\n   - After the BFS completes, check if there are any fresh oranges left (`fresh_count > 0`).\n   - If there are fresh oranges left, it means not all fresh oranges can become rotten, and we should return -1.\n   - If all fresh oranges have become rotten, return the `minutes` as the result.\n\n5. **Edge Cases**:\n   - If there are no fresh oranges initially, the result is 0 minutes.\n   - If there are no rotten oranges initially and there are fresh oranges, the result is -1.\n\nNow, let's apply this process to the given grid:\n\n- **Initial Setup**:\n  - Count the number of fresh oranges and identify the positions of all rotten oranges.\n  - Initialize the queue with the positions of rotten oranges.\n\n- **BFS Execution**:\n  - Process each level of the queue, spreading the rot to adjacent fresh oranges.\n  - Track the number of minutes and update the fresh orange count.\n\n- **Final Check**:\n  - If there are no fresh oranges left, return the number of minutes.\n  - If there are still fresh oranges, return -1.\n\nAfter applying this process to the given grid, we find that all fresh oranges can become rotten in 5 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
