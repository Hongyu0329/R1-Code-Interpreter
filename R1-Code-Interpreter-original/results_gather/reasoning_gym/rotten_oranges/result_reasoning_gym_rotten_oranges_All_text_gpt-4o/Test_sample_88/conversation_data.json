    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to model the spread of rot from rotten oranges to adjacent fresh oranges. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initialize Data Structures**:\n   - Create a queue to store the positions of all initially rotten oranges. This will help us perform a BFS.\n   - Count the number of fresh oranges in the grid. This will help us determine if all fresh oranges have been rotted by the end of the process.\n\n2. **Populate Initial Queue**:\n   - Traverse the grid and add all rotten oranges (value 2) to the queue with their positions and an initial time of 0 minutes.\n   - Count the total number of fresh oranges (value 1).\n\n3. **BFS Process**:\n   - Initialize a variable `minutes` to track the time elapsed.\n   - While the queue is not empty, process each rotten orange in the queue:\n     - Dequeue an orange and get its position and the time it took to rot.\n     - For each of the four possible directions (up, down, left, right), check if there is a fresh orange adjacent to the current rotten orange.\n     - If a fresh orange is found, rot it (change its value to 2), decrease the count of fresh oranges, and enqueue it with the incremented time.\n     - Update the `minutes` variable to the maximum time encountered during the BFS.\n\n4. **Check for Remaining Fresh Oranges**:\n   - After the BFS completes, check if there are any fresh oranges left (i.e., if the count of fresh oranges is greater than zero).\n   - If there are fresh oranges left, it means not all oranges can be rotted, and we should return -1.\n\n5. **Return the Result**:\n   - If all fresh oranges have been rotted, return the `minutes` variable, which contains the minimum number of minutes required to rot all oranges.\n\nNow, applying this process to the given grid:\n\n- We start by identifying all the initial rotten oranges and counting the fresh ones.\n- We perform a BFS to simulate the rotting process minute by minute.\n- After the BFS, we check if any fresh oranges remain.\n\nAfter performing these steps on the provided grid, we find that all fresh oranges can be rotted in 4 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange is:\n\n<<<4>>>"
