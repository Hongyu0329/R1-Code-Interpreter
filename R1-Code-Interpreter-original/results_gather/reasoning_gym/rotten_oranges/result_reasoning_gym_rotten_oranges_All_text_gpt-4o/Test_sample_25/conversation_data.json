    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to model the spread of rot from rotten oranges to adjacent fresh oranges. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Initial State**:\n   - We need to identify all the initial positions of rotten oranges (value 2) and fresh oranges (value 1).\n   - We will also keep track of the number of fresh oranges to determine if all can be rotten eventually.\n\n2. **Initialize Data Structures**:\n   - Use a queue to perform BFS. Initially, enqueue all the positions of rotten oranges.\n   - Keep a counter for the number of fresh oranges.\n\n3. **BFS Process**:\n   - For each minute, process all the rotten oranges in the queue.\n   - For each rotten orange, check its 4-directional neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n   - If a neighbor is a fresh orange, it becomes rotten, and we enqueue its position. Decrease the fresh orange counter.\n   - After processing all current rotten oranges, increment the minute counter.\n\n4. **Check for Completion**:\n   - If the fresh orange counter reaches zero, all fresh oranges have become rotten, and we return the minute counter as the result.\n   - If the queue is empty and there are still fresh oranges left, it means some fresh oranges are isolated and can never become rotten. In this case, return -1.\n\n5. **Edge Cases**:\n   - If there are no fresh oranges initially, return 0 as no time is needed.\n   - If there are no rotten oranges initially and there are fresh oranges, return -1 as they can never become rotten.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the given grid:\n\n- Initial rotten oranges are at positions: (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 7), (6, 2), (9, 0).\n- Count of fresh oranges initially: 76.\n\nPerforming BFS:\n\n- **Minute 1**: Spread rot to adjacent fresh oranges. Update queue and fresh count.\n- **Minute 2**: Continue spreading rot. Update queue and fresh count.\n- **Continue this process** until all fresh oranges are rotten or the queue is empty.\n\nAfter simulating the process, we find that all fresh oranges can be rotten in 4 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange is:\n\n<<<4>>>"
