    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is suitable for problems involving spreading or expansion, such as this one.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Conditions:**\n   - We have a grid of size 13x13.\n   - Each cell can be empty (0), have a fresh orange (1), or have a rotten orange (2).\n\n2. **Initialize Data Structures:**\n   - Use a queue to perform BFS. Initially, enqueue all the positions of rotten oranges (value 2) because they are the starting points for the spread of rot.\n   - Keep track of the number of fresh oranges (value 1) to determine when all have become rotten.\n\n3. **BFS Process:**\n   - For each rotten orange, check its 4-directional neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n   - If a neighbor is a fresh orange, it becomes rotten, and we enqueue its position.\n   - Decrease the count of fresh oranges each time a fresh orange becomes rotten.\n   - Track the number of minutes (or levels in BFS) it takes for all fresh oranges to become rotten.\n\n4. **Edge Cases:**\n   - If there are no fresh oranges initially, the answer is 0 minutes.\n   - If there are fresh oranges that cannot be reached by any rotten orange, the answer is -1.\n\n5. **Simulate the Process:**\n   - Start with all initially rotten oranges in the queue.\n   - For each minute, process all rotten oranges in the queue, spreading the rot to adjacent fresh oranges.\n   - Increment the minute counter after processing each level of BFS.\n   - Stop when there are no more fresh oranges or when the queue is empty.\n\n6. **Determine the Result:**\n   - If all fresh oranges have become rotten, return the number of minutes.\n   - If there are still fresh oranges left after the queue is empty, return -1.\n\n### Execution:\n\n- Start with the initial grid and identify all rotten oranges.\n- Count the total number of fresh oranges.\n- Use BFS to spread the rot, updating the grid and fresh orange count.\n- Track the time taken for all fresh oranges to rot.\n\nAfter simulating the process on the given grid, we find that all fresh oranges can be reached and turned rotten.\n\nThe minimum number of minutes required for all fresh oranges to become rotten is:\n\n<<<6>>>"
