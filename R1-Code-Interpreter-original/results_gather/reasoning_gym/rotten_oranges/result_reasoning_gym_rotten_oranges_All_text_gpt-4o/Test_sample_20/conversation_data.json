    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is suitable for problems involving spreading or expansion, like this one.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Initialize Data Structures:**\n   - Create a queue to keep track of all initially rotten oranges. Each entry in the queue will store the position of a rotten orange and the time (in minutes) since it became rotten.\n   - Count the total number of fresh oranges.\n\n2. **Populate Initial Queue:**\n   - Traverse the grid to find all rotten oranges (value 2) and add them to the queue with a time of 0 minutes.\n   - Count the number of fresh oranges (value 1).\n\n3. **BFS Process:**\n   - While the queue is not empty, perform the following:\n     - Dequeue an element from the queue. This element contains the position of a rotten orange and the time since it became rotten.\n     - For each of the four possible directions (up, down, left, right), check if there is a fresh orange adjacent to the current rotten orange.\n     - If a fresh orange is found, it becomes rotten, and we add it to the queue with the time incremented by 1 minute.\n     - Decrease the count of fresh oranges by 1 for each fresh orange that becomes rotten.\n\n4. **Check for Remaining Fresh Oranges:**\n   - After the BFS completes, check if there are any fresh oranges left.\n   - If there are fresh oranges remaining, it means not all fresh oranges can be reached by rotten ones, so return -1.\n   - If no fresh oranges remain, the time of the last rotten orange processed in the queue is the answer.\n\n5. **Edge Cases:**\n   - If there are no fresh oranges initially, the answer is 0 because no time is needed for all oranges to become rotten.\n   - If there are no rotten oranges initially and there are fresh oranges, the answer is -1 because fresh oranges cannot become rotten.\n\n### Applying the Analysis to the Given Grid:\n\n- **Initial Setup:**\n  - Traverse the grid to find all rotten oranges and add them to the queue.\n  - Count the total number of fresh oranges.\n\n- **BFS Execution:**\n  - Process each rotten orange in the queue, spreading the rot to adjacent fresh oranges.\n  - Keep track of the time taken for each orange to become rotten.\n\n- **Final Check:**\n  - If there are no fresh oranges left, return the time taken for the last orange to become rotten.\n  - If there are still fresh oranges, return -1.\n\nAfter applying the above steps to the given grid, we determine the minimum number of minutes required for all fresh oranges to become rotten.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<4>>>"
