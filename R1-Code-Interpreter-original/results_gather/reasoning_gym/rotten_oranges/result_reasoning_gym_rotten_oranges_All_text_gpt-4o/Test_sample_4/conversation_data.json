    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is suitable for problems involving spreading or expansion, like this one.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Initialize Data Structures:**\n   - Use a queue to keep track of all initially rotten oranges. Each element in the queue will be a tuple containing the coordinates of the rotten orange and the time (in minutes) since it became rotten.\n   - Count the number of fresh oranges at the start.\n\n2. **Populate Initial Queue:**\n   - Traverse the grid and add all rotten oranges (value 2) to the queue with a time of 0 minutes.\n   - Count the total number of fresh oranges (value 1).\n\n3. **BFS Process:**\n   - Initialize a variable `minutes_passed` to track the time taken for all oranges to rot.\n   - While the queue is not empty, perform the following:\n     - Dequeue an element from the queue. This element contains the coordinates of a rotten orange and the time since it became rotten.\n     - For each of the four possible directions (up, down, left, right), check if there is a fresh orange adjacent to the current rotten orange.\n     - If a fresh orange is found, it becomes rotten. Add this new rotten orange to the queue with the time incremented by 1 minute.\n     - Decrease the count of fresh oranges by 1.\n     - Update `minutes_passed` to the maximum time encountered in the queue.\n\n4. **Check for Remaining Fresh Oranges:**\n   - After the BFS completes, check if there are any fresh oranges left.\n   - If there are fresh oranges remaining, it means not all oranges can become rotten, and we should return -1.\n   - If no fresh oranges remain, return the `minutes_passed` as the result.\n\n5. **Edge Cases:**\n   - If there are no fresh oranges to begin with, the answer is 0 minutes.\n   - If there are no rotten oranges initially and there are fresh oranges, the answer is -1.\n\n### Applying the Analysis to the Given Grid:\n\n- Start by identifying all rotten oranges and their positions.\n- Count the initial number of fresh oranges.\n- Use BFS to simulate the rotting process minute by minute.\n- Track the time taken for the last fresh orange to rot.\n- If any fresh oranges remain after the BFS, return -1.\n\nAfter applying the above steps to the given grid, the minimum number of minutes required for all fresh oranges to become rotten is determined.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<13>>>"
