    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to model the spread of rot from rotten oranges to adjacent fresh oranges. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Initial State**:\n   - Traverse the grid to identify all initial positions of rotten oranges (value 2) and fresh oranges (value 1).\n   - Count the total number of fresh oranges.\n   - Use a queue to store the positions of all initially rotten oranges, as these will be the starting points for the BFS.\n\n2. **BFS Initialization**:\n   - Initialize a queue with the positions of all rotten oranges.\n   - Initialize a variable `minutes` to track the time elapsed, starting at 0.\n\n3. **BFS Process**:\n   - While the queue is not empty and there are still fresh oranges:\n     - For each rotten orange in the queue, check its 4-directionally adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).\n     - If an adjacent cell contains a fresh orange, it becomes rotten. Add this new rotten orange to the queue.\n     - Decrease the count of fresh oranges by 1 for each fresh orange that becomes rotten.\n   - After processing all oranges in the current queue, increment the `minutes` counter by 1.\n\n4. **Check for Remaining Fresh Oranges**:\n   - After the BFS completes, check if there are any fresh oranges left.\n   - If there are no fresh oranges left, the `minutes` variable contains the minimum time required for all oranges to rot.\n   - If there are still fresh oranges, it means some fresh oranges are isolated and cannot be reached by any rotten orange, so return -1.\n\n5. **Edge Cases**:\n   - If there are no fresh oranges initially, return 0 as no time is needed.\n   - If there are no rotten oranges initially and there are fresh oranges, return -1 as the fresh oranges can never rot.\n\nNow, applying this process to the given grid:\n\n- Initial rotten oranges are at positions: (1, 9), (2, 2), (2, 8), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 8), (5, 1), (5, 5), (6, 0), (6, 11), (9, 9), (10, 4), (10, 12), (12, 2), (12, 6), (12, 12), (12, 13), (13, 9), (13, 11), (13, 13).\n- Total fresh oranges initially: 108.\n\nFollowing the BFS process, we simulate the spread of rot minute by minute. After simulating, we find that all fresh oranges can be reached and turned rotten in 6 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange is:\n\n<<<6>>>"
