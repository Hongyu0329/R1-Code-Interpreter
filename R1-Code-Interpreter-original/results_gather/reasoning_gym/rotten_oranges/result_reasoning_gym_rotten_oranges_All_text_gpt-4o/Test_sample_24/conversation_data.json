    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to model the spread of rot from rotten oranges to adjacent fresh oranges. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Initial State:**\n   - Traverse the grid to identify all initially rotten oranges (value 2) and add their positions to a queue. This queue will help us perform a BFS.\n   - Count the number of fresh oranges (value 1) in the grid. If there are no fresh oranges, the answer is 0 minutes since no fresh orange needs to rot.\n\n2. **BFS Simulation:**\n   - Initialize a variable `minutes` to track the time elapsed.\n   - While the queue is not empty and there are fresh oranges remaining:\n     - For each rotten orange in the queue, check its 4-directionally adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).\n     - If an adjacent cell contains a fresh orange, it becomes rotten. Add this new rotten orange to the queue and decrease the count of fresh oranges.\n     - After processing all oranges in the current queue, increment the `minutes` counter.\n\n3. **Check for Remaining Fresh Oranges:**\n   - After the BFS completes, check if there are any fresh oranges left. If there are, it means some fresh oranges could not be reached by the rot, and the answer is -1.\n   - If all fresh oranges have become rotten, the `minutes` counter will give the minimum time required.\n\n4. **Edge Cases:**\n   - If the grid is empty or contains only empty cells, the answer is 0.\n   - If there are no initially rotten oranges and there are fresh oranges, the answer is -1.\n\nNow, applying this logic to the given grid:\n\n- Start by identifying all initially rotten oranges and count the fresh oranges.\n- Perform BFS to simulate the spread of rot.\n- Track the time taken for all fresh oranges to become rotten.\n\nAfter performing these steps on the provided grid, the minimum number of minutes required for all fresh oranges to become rotten is determined.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<6>>>"
