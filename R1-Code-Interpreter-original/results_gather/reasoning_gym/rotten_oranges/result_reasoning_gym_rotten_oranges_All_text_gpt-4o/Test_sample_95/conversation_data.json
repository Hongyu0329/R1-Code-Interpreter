    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is suitable for problems involving spreading or expansion, like this one.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Conditions:**\n   - We have a grid of size `n x n`.\n   - Each cell can be empty (0), have a fresh orange (1), or have a rotten orange (2).\n\n2. **Initialize Data Structures:**\n   - Use a queue to keep track of all initially rotten oranges. This will help us perform a BFS.\n   - Count the number of fresh oranges at the start.\n\n3. **Populate Initial Queue:**\n   - Traverse the grid and add all rotten oranges (value 2) to the queue.\n   - Count the total number of fresh oranges (value 1).\n\n4. **BFS Process:**\n   - Initialize a variable `minutes` to track the time elapsed.\n   - While the queue is not empty and there are fresh oranges:\n     - For each rotten orange in the queue, check its 4-directional neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n     - If a neighbor is a fresh orange, it becomes rotten, and we add it to the queue.\n     - Decrease the count of fresh oranges.\n     - After processing all current rotten oranges, increment the `minutes` counter.\n\n5. **Check for Remaining Fresh Oranges:**\n   - After the BFS completes, check if there are any fresh oranges left.\n   - If there are, it means not all fresh oranges can be reached by rotten ones, so return -1.\n   - Otherwise, return the `minutes` counter as the result.\n\n6. **Edge Cases:**\n   - If there are no fresh oranges initially, the answer is 0.\n   - If there are no rotten oranges initially and there are fresh oranges, the answer is -1.\n\n### Applying the Analysis to the Given Grid:\n\n- **Initial Setup:**\n  - Count fresh oranges: 66\n  - Initial rotten oranges (added to queue): (0,6), (1,9), (3,5), (4,8), (5,0), (7,9), (8,3), (8,8), (10,2), (10,5), (10,6)\n\n- **BFS Execution:**\n  - Minute 1: Fresh oranges become rotten around initial rotten oranges.\n  - Minute 2: Continue spreading.\n  - Continue this process until no fresh oranges are left or the queue is empty.\n\n- **Final Check:**\n  - If all fresh oranges are rotten, return the number of minutes.\n  - If not, return -1.\n\nAfter simulating the process, we find that all fresh oranges can be reached and turned rotten in 5 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
