    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to model the spread of rot from initially rotten oranges to adjacent fresh oranges. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Conditions:**\n   - We have a grid of size `n x n` where each cell can be 0 (empty), 1 (fresh orange), or 2 (rotten orange).\n   - We need to determine the minimum number of minutes required for all fresh oranges to become rotten, or return -1 if it's impossible.\n\n2. **Initialize Data Structures:**\n   - Use a queue to perform BFS. Initially, enqueue all positions of rotten oranges (value 2) along with a timestamp (minute 0).\n   - Count the total number of fresh oranges (value 1) in the grid.\n\n3. **BFS Process:**\n   - While the queue is not empty, process each rotten orange:\n     - Dequeue the current rotten orange and its timestamp.\n     - For each of the four possible directions (up, down, left, right), check if there is a fresh orange adjacent to the current rotten orange.\n     - If a fresh orange is found, it becomes rotten, decrement the count of fresh oranges, and enqueue its position with the incremented timestamp.\n   - Keep track of the maximum timestamp encountered during the BFS, as this represents the time taken for the last fresh orange to become rotten.\n\n4. **Check for Remaining Fresh Oranges:**\n   - After the BFS completes, if there are still fresh oranges left (count is not zero), return -1 as it's impossible to rot all oranges.\n   - Otherwise, return the maximum timestamp as the result.\n\n5. **Edge Cases:**\n   - If there are no fresh oranges initially, the answer is 0.\n   - If there are no rotten oranges initially and there are fresh oranges, the answer is -1.\n\nNow, applying this process to the given grid:\n\n- Initialize the queue with all rotten oranges and count the fresh oranges.\n- Perform BFS to spread the rot to adjacent fresh oranges.\n- Track the time taken for the last fresh orange to rot.\n- If any fresh oranges remain after the BFS, return -1.\n\nAfter performing these steps on the provided grid, the minimum number of minutes required for all fresh oranges to become rotten is determined.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<5>>>."
