    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is suitable for problems involving spreading or expansion, such as this one.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Conditions:**\n   - We have a grid of size 12x12.\n   - Each cell can be empty (0), have a fresh orange (1), or have a rotten orange (2).\n\n2. **Initialize Data Structures:**\n   - Use a queue to perform BFS. Initially, enqueue all rotten oranges (cells with value 2) along with the time (minute) they start rotting, which is 0.\n   - Count the total number of fresh oranges.\n\n3. **BFS Process:**\n   - While the queue is not empty, process each rotten orange:\n     - Dequeue the current rotten orange and its time.\n     - For each of the four possible directions (up, down, left, right), check if there is a fresh orange adjacent to the current rotten orange.\n     - If a fresh orange is found, it becomes rotten, and we enqueue it with the time incremented by 1.\n     - Decrease the count of fresh oranges.\n\n4. **Check for Completion:**\n   - If the queue is empty and there are still fresh oranges left, it means not all fresh oranges can become rotten, so return -1.\n   - Otherwise, the last time value processed in the queue will be the minimum number of minutes required for all oranges to become rotten.\n\n5. **Edge Cases:**\n   - If there are no fresh oranges initially, the answer is 0.\n   - If there are no rotten oranges initially and there are fresh oranges, the answer is -1.\n\n### Applying the Analysis to the Given Grid:\n\n- **Initial Setup:**\n  - Enqueue all rotten oranges with their initial time (0).\n  - Count the total number of fresh oranges.\n\n- **BFS Execution:**\n  - Process each rotten orange, spreading the rot to adjacent fresh oranges.\n  - Keep track of the time taken for each spread.\n\n- **Final Check:**\n  - If all fresh oranges are rotten by the end of the BFS, return the last time value.\n  - If any fresh oranges remain, return -1.\n\nAfter applying the BFS to the given grid, we find that all fresh oranges can be turned rotten in 5 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
