    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to model the spread of rot from rotten oranges to adjacent fresh oranges. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Initial State**:\n   - We need to identify all the initial positions of rotten oranges (value 2) and fresh oranges (value 1).\n   - We will use a queue to keep track of the positions of rotten oranges, as they will be the starting points for the BFS.\n\n2. **Initialize the Queue**:\n   - Enqueue all the initial positions of rotten oranges along with a timestamp (minute) of 0, indicating the starting point of the spread.\n\n3. **Count Fresh Oranges**:\n   - Count the total number of fresh oranges at the start. This will help us determine if all fresh oranges have been rotted by the end of the process.\n\n4. **BFS Process**:\n   - While the queue is not empty, perform the following:\n     - Dequeue an element from the queue, which gives us the current position of a rotten orange and the current minute.\n     - For each of the four possible directions (up, down, left, right), check if there is a fresh orange adjacent to the current rotten orange.\n     - If a fresh orange is found, it becomes rotten, and we enqueue its position with the current minute incremented by 1.\n     - Decrease the count of fresh oranges by 1 for each fresh orange that becomes rotten.\n\n5. **Check Completion**:\n   - After the BFS completes, check if there are any fresh oranges left.\n   - If there are no fresh oranges left, the last minute processed in the BFS is the answer.\n   - If there are still fresh oranges left, it means some fresh oranges could not be reached by any rotten orange, and the answer is -1.\n\n6. **Edge Cases**:\n   - If there are no fresh oranges at the start, the answer is 0 because no time is needed to rot all oranges.\n   - If there are no rotten oranges at the start and there are fresh oranges, the answer is -1 because the fresh oranges can never become rotten.\n\nNow, let's apply this process to the given grid:\n\n- Initial rotten oranges are at positions: (0,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,8), (2,4), (3,2), (5,1), (5,8), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2).\n- Initial fresh orange count: 71.\n\nPerforming the BFS, we find that all fresh oranges can be rotted in 5 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
