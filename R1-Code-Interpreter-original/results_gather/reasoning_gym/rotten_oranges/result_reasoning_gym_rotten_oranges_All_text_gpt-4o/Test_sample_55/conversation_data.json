    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is suitable for problems involving spreading or expansion, like this one.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Initial State:**\n   - We have a grid of size 14x14.\n   - Each cell can be empty (0), have a fresh orange (1), or have a rotten orange (2).\n\n2. **Initialize Data Structures:**\n   - Use a queue to perform BFS. Initially, enqueue all the positions of rotten oranges (value 2) because they are the starting points for the spread of rot.\n   - Keep track of the number of fresh oranges (value 1) to determine when all have become rotten.\n\n3. **BFS Process:**\n   - For each minute, process all the rotten oranges in the queue.\n   - For each rotten orange, check its 4-directional neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n   - If a neighbor is a fresh orange, it becomes rotten, and we enqueue its position.\n   - Decrease the count of fresh oranges each time one becomes rotten.\n\n4. **Count Minutes:**\n   - Keep a counter for the number of minutes elapsed.\n   - After processing all rotten oranges for a minute, increment the minute counter.\n\n5. **Check for Completion:**\n   - If the queue is empty and there are still fresh oranges left, it means not all fresh oranges can become rotten, so return -1.\n   - If all fresh oranges have become rotten, return the number of minutes elapsed.\n\n6. **Edge Cases:**\n   - If there are no fresh oranges initially, the answer is 0 minutes.\n   - If there are no rotten oranges initially and there are fresh oranges, the answer is -1.\n\n### Applying the Steps to the Given Grid:\n\n- **Initial Setup:**\n  - Enqueue all rotten oranges: (1, 6), (1, 9), (6, 2), (6, 5), (6, 9), (7, 11), (9, 13), (10, 5), (10, 6), (10, 7), (12, 2), (13, 0), (13, 2), (13, 11).\n  - Count fresh oranges: 128.\n\n- **BFS Execution:**\n  - Minute 1: Process all initial rotten oranges, spread to adjacent fresh oranges, and update the queue.\n  - Continue this process, incrementing the minute counter each time all current rotten oranges are processed.\n\n- **Completion Check:**\n  - Continue until all fresh oranges are rotten or the queue is empty.\n  - In this case, all fresh oranges become rotten after 6 minutes.\n\nThus, the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange is:\n\n<<<6>>>"
