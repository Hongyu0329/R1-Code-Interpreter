    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to model the spread of rot from rotten oranges to adjacent fresh oranges. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initialize Data Structures**:\n   - Create a queue to store the positions of all initially rotten oranges. This will help us perform a BFS.\n   - Count the number of fresh oranges in the grid. This will help us determine if all fresh oranges have become rotten.\n\n2. **Populate Initial Queue**:\n   - Traverse the grid and add all rotten oranges (value 2) to the queue. Also, count the total number of fresh oranges (value 1).\n\n3. **BFS Process**:\n   - Initialize a variable `minutes` to track the time elapsed.\n   - While the queue is not empty and there are fresh oranges remaining:\n     - For each rotten orange in the queue, check its 4-directional neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n     - If a neighbor is a fresh orange, turn it rotten, decrease the fresh orange count, and add it to the queue.\n     - After processing all oranges in the current level of the queue, increment the `minutes` counter.\n\n4. **Check for Remaining Fresh Oranges**:\n   - After the BFS completes, check if there are any fresh oranges left.\n   - If there are, it means not all fresh oranges can be reached by the rot, so return -1.\n   - Otherwise, return the `minutes` counter as the result.\n\n5. **Edge Cases**:\n   - If there are no fresh oranges initially, return 0 as no time is needed.\n   - If there are no rotten oranges initially and there are fresh oranges, return -1 as the fresh oranges can never rot.\n\nNow, let's apply this process to the given grid:\n\n- **Initial Setup**:\n  - Count fresh oranges and identify initial rotten oranges.\n  - Fresh oranges count: 425\n  - Initial rotten oranges positions: (0,6), (0,11), (0,15), (1,14), (1,19), (1,20), (1,21), (2,3), (2,7), (2,20), (3,10), (3,13), (5,22), (6,9), (6,19), (7,11), (7,17), (7,18), (7,19), (8,2), (8,5), (8,21), (9,2), (9,11), (9,17), (10,0), (10,7), (10,17), (11,3), (11,5), (11,8), (11,12), (11,21), (12,8), (13,14), (13,15), (13,18), (13,20), (14,13), (14,14), (14,18), (14,20), (15,10), (15,11), (16,3), (16,10), (16,20), (17,10), (18,9), (18,20), (19,4), (19,20), (20,4), (20,15), (21,11), (21,21), (22,8), (22,9), (23,2), (23,5), (23,8), (23,17), (24,6).\n\n- **BFS Simulation**:\n  - Perform BFS from the initial rotten oranges, spreading the rot to adjacent fresh oranges.\n  - Track the number of minutes elapsed until all reachable fresh oranges are rotten.\n\n- **Final Check**:\n  - After BFS, check if any fresh oranges remain. If not, return the number of minutes elapsed.\n\nAfter simulating the process, the minimum number of minutes required for all reachable fresh oranges to become rotten is 8.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<8>>>"
