    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to model the spread of rot from rotten oranges to adjacent fresh oranges. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Initial State**:\n   - Traverse the grid to identify all the initial positions of rotten oranges (value 2).\n   - Count the total number of fresh oranges (value 1) in the grid.\n\n2. **Initialize BFS**:\n   - Use a queue to perform BFS. Initially, enqueue all the positions of rotten oranges along with a timestamp (minute) of 0.\n   - Keep track of the number of fresh oranges that have turned rotten.\n\n3. **BFS Process**:\n   - While the queue is not empty, perform the following:\n     - Dequeue an element which contains the position of a rotten orange and the current minute.\n     - For each of the four possible directions (up, down, left, right), check if there is a fresh orange adjacent to the current rotten orange.\n     - If a fresh orange is found, turn it rotten, enqueue its position with the current minute + 1, and increment the count of rotten oranges.\n     - Continue this process until the queue is empty.\n\n4. **Determine the Result**:\n   - If the number of fresh oranges that have turned rotten equals the initial count of fresh oranges, then all fresh oranges have been rotted, and the last minute processed in the BFS is the answer.\n   - If there are still fresh oranges left after the BFS completes, it means some fresh oranges are isolated and cannot be rotted, so return -1.\n\n5. **Edge Cases**:\n   - If there are no fresh oranges initially, the answer is 0 because no time is needed to rot all oranges.\n   - If there are no rotten oranges initially and there are fresh oranges, the answer is -1 because the fresh oranges cannot rot.\n\nNow, applying this process to the given grid:\n\n- After initializing the BFS with all initial rotten oranges and counting fresh oranges, we perform the BFS.\n- The BFS will spread the rot minute by minute, and we keep track of the time taken.\n- After the BFS completes, we check if all fresh oranges have been rotted.\n\nAfter performing these steps on the given grid, the minimum number of minutes required to rot all fresh oranges is determined to be:\n\n<<<6>>>"
