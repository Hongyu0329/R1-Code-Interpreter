    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to model the spread of rot from rotten oranges to adjacent fresh oranges. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initialize Data Structures**:\n   - Use a queue to keep track of all initially rotten oranges. Each element in the queue will be a tuple containing the coordinates of the rotten orange and the time (in minutes) at which it became rotten.\n   - Count the total number of fresh oranges at the start.\n\n2. **Populate Initial Queue**:\n   - Traverse the grid and add all rotten oranges (value 2) to the queue with a time of 0 minutes.\n   - Count the number of fresh oranges (value 1).\n\n3. **BFS to Spread Rot**:\n   - Use BFS to process each rotten orange in the queue. For each rotten orange, check its 4-directional neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n   - If a neighbor is a fresh orange, it becomes rotten, and we add it to the queue with the current time + 1 minute.\n   - Decrease the count of fresh oranges each time a fresh orange becomes rotten.\n\n4. **Track Time**:\n   - Keep track of the maximum time taken for the last fresh orange to become rotten.\n\n5. **Check for Remaining Fresh Oranges**:\n   - After processing all oranges in the queue, check if there are any fresh oranges left.\n   - If there are fresh oranges remaining, it means they cannot be reached by any rotten orange, and the task is impossible.\n\n6. **Return Result**:\n   - If all fresh oranges have become rotten, return the maximum time recorded.\n   - If there are still fresh oranges, return -1.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the given grid:\n\n- Start by identifying all rotten oranges and their positions.\n- Count the initial number of fresh oranges.\n- Use BFS to simulate the spread of rot, updating the time and fresh orange count.\n- After BFS completes, check if any fresh oranges remain.\n\nAfter performing these steps on the provided grid, we find that all fresh oranges can be reached and turned rotten. The maximum time taken for the last fresh orange to become rotten is 6 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange is:\n\n<<<6>>>"
