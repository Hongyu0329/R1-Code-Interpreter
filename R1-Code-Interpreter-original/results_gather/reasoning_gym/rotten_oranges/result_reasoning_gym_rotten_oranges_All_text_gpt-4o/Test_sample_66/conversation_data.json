    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to model the spread of rot from rotten oranges to adjacent fresh oranges. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Rotten Oranges**: \n   - Traverse the grid to find all the initial positions of rotten oranges (value 2). These will be our starting points for the BFS.\n\n2. **Track Fresh Oranges**:\n   - Count the number of fresh oranges (value 1) in the grid. If there are no fresh oranges initially, the answer is 0 minutes.\n\n3. **BFS Initialization**:\n   - Use a queue to perform BFS. Initialize the queue with all the positions of the initial rotten oranges.\n   - Keep track of the time (in minutes) it takes for all fresh oranges to become rotten.\n\n4. **BFS Execution**:\n   - For each minute, process all the rotten oranges in the queue.\n   - For each rotten orange, check its 4-directionally adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).\n   - If an adjacent cell contains a fresh orange, it becomes rotten, and we add its position to the queue.\n   - Decrease the count of fresh oranges each time a fresh orange becomes rotten.\n\n5. **Check for Completion**:\n   - Continue the BFS until there are no more fresh oranges or the queue is empty.\n   - If there are still fresh oranges left after the queue is empty, it means some fresh oranges are unreachable by any rotten orange, and the answer is -1.\n\n6. **Calculate the Result**:\n   - If all fresh oranges have become rotten, the time taken is the number of BFS levels (or minutes) processed.\n   - If there are unreachable fresh oranges, return -1.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the given grid:\n\n- Start by identifying all initial rotten oranges and count the fresh oranges.\n- Use BFS to spread the rot from the initial rotten oranges.\n- Track the time taken for all fresh oranges to become rotten.\n- If any fresh oranges remain after the BFS completes, return -1.\n\nAfter performing these steps on the provided grid, the minimum number of minutes required for all fresh oranges to become rotten is calculated.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<13>>>"
