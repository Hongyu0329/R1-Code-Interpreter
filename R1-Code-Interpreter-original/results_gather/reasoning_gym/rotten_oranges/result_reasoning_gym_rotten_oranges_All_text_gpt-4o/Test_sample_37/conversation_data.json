    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is suitable for problems involving spreading or expansion, like this one.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Initial State:**\n   - We need to identify all the initially rotten oranges (value 2) and add their positions to a queue. This will help us track which oranges can rot their neighbors in the next minute.\n   - Count the number of fresh oranges (value 1) initially present in the grid.\n\n2. **BFS Initialization:**\n   - Initialize a queue with all the positions of the rotten oranges.\n   - Initialize a variable `minutes` to track the time elapsed.\n   - Initialize a variable `fresh_count` to track the number of fresh oranges.\n\n3. **BFS Process:**\n   - While the queue is not empty and there are fresh oranges:\n     - For each rotten orange in the queue, check its 4-directional neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n     - If a neighbor is a fresh orange, rot it (change its value to 2), decrease the `fresh_count` by 1, and add its position to the queue.\n     - After processing all oranges in the current queue, increment the `minutes` by 1.\n\n4. **Check for Remaining Fresh Oranges:**\n   - After the BFS completes, check if there are any fresh oranges left (`fresh_count > 0`).\n   - If there are fresh oranges left, it means they cannot be reached by any rotten orange, so return -1.\n   - Otherwise, return the `minutes` as the result.\n\n5. **Edge Cases:**\n   - If there are no fresh oranges initially, the answer is 0 because no time is needed.\n   - If there are no rotten oranges initially and there are fresh oranges, the answer is -1 because the fresh oranges can never rot.\n\n### Applying the Analysis to the Given Grid:\n\n- **Initial Rotten Oranges:**\n  - Positions: (1,3), (1,6), (2,1), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (5,5), (8,3), (10,4)\n\n- **Initial Fresh Count:**\n  - Count the number of 1s in the grid.\n\n- **BFS Execution:**\n  - Start with the initial rotten oranges and process each level of the BFS, rotting adjacent fresh oranges and updating the queue.\n\n- **Final Check:**\n  - After the BFS, check if any fresh oranges remain.\n\nAfter simulating the process, the minimum number of minutes required for all fresh oranges to rot is determined.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<5>>>"
