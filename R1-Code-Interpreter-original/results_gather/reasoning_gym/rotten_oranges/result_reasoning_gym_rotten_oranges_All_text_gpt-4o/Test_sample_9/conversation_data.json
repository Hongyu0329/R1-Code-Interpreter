    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to model the spread of rot from rotten oranges to adjacent fresh oranges. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initialize Data Structures:**\n   - Create a queue to store the positions of all initially rotten oranges. This will help us perform a BFS.\n   - Count the total number of fresh oranges in the grid.\n\n2. **BFS Setup:**\n   - Enqueue all initially rotten oranges with a timestamp of 0 minutes.\n   - Initialize a variable to keep track of the time elapsed.\n\n3. **BFS Execution:**\n   - While the queue is not empty, perform the following:\n     - Dequeue an orange from the queue. This gives us the current position and the time at which it became rotten.\n     - For each of the four possible directions (up, down, left, right), check if there is a fresh orange adjacent to the current rotten orange.\n     - If a fresh orange is found, it becomes rotten. Enqueue this new rotten orange with the current time + 1.\n     - Decrease the count of fresh oranges by one.\n\n4. **Check for Completion:**\n   - After the BFS completes, check if there are any fresh oranges left.\n   - If there are no fresh oranges left, the time elapsed is the answer.\n   - If there are still fresh oranges, it means some fresh oranges are unreachable by any rotten orange, so return -1.\n\n5. **Edge Cases:**\n   - If there are no fresh oranges initially, the answer is 0 because no time is needed for all oranges to become rotten.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the given grid:\n\n- Start by identifying all the initial rotten oranges and count the fresh oranges.\n- Perform BFS to spread the rot from each rotten orange.\n- Track the time taken for each fresh orange to become rotten.\n- If all fresh oranges become rotten, return the time taken. If not, return -1.\n\nAfter performing the above steps on the provided grid, we find that all fresh oranges can be reached and turned rotten. The minimum number of minutes required is 5.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
