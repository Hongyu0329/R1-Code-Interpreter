    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to model the spread of rot from rotten oranges to adjacent fresh oranges. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Conditions:**\n   - We need to identify all the initial positions of rotten oranges (value 2) in the grid.\n   - We also need to count the total number of fresh oranges (value 1) in the grid.\n\n2. **Initialize Data Structures:**\n   - Use a queue to perform BFS. Initially, enqueue all the positions of rotten oranges.\n   - Keep track of the number of fresh oranges that have not yet rotted.\n\n3. **BFS Process:**\n   - For each minute, process all the rotten oranges in the queue.\n   - For each rotten orange, check its 4-directionally adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).\n   - If an adjacent cell contains a fresh orange, it becomes rotten, and we enqueue its position.\n   - Decrease the count of fresh oranges each time a fresh orange becomes rotten.\n\n4. **Track Time:**\n   - Keep a counter to track the number of minutes elapsed.\n   - After processing all rotten oranges for a given minute, increment the minute counter.\n\n5. **Check for Completion:**\n   - If the queue is empty and there are still fresh oranges left, it means not all fresh oranges can become rotten, so return -1.\n   - If all fresh oranges have become rotten, return the number of minutes elapsed.\n\n6. **Edge Cases:**\n   - If there are no fresh oranges initially, return 0 as no time is needed.\n   - If there are no rotten oranges initially and there are fresh oranges, return -1 as they can never become rotten.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the given grid:\n\n- **Initial Setup:**\n  - Identify all rotten oranges and enqueue their positions.\n  - Count the total number of fresh oranges.\n\n- **Simulate the Process:**\n  - Use BFS to spread the rot from rotten oranges to adjacent fresh oranges.\n  - Track the number of minutes and the number of fresh oranges that become rotten.\n\n- **Determine the Result:**\n  - If all fresh oranges become rotten, return the number of minutes.\n  - If not all fresh oranges can become rotten, return -1.\n\nAfter applying the above steps to the given grid, the minimum number of minutes required for all fresh oranges to become rotten is determined.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<4>>>"
