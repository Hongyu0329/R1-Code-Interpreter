    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to model the spread of rot from rotten oranges to adjacent fresh oranges. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:\n\n1. **Initialize Data Structures**:\n   - Create a queue to store the positions of all initially rotten oranges. This will help us perform a BFS.\n   - Count the total number of fresh oranges in the grid.\n\n2. **Populate Initial Queue**:\n   - Traverse the grid and add all rotten oranges (value 2) to the queue. Also, count the number of fresh oranges (value 1).\n\n3. **BFS Simulation**:\n   - Initialize a variable `minutes` to track the time elapsed.\n   - While the queue is not empty and there are fresh oranges left:\n     - For each rotten orange in the queue, check its 4-directionally adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).\n     - If an adjacent cell contains a fresh orange, turn it rotten, decrease the fresh orange count, and add the new rotten orange to the queue.\n     - After processing all oranges in the current queue, increment the `minutes` counter.\n\n4. **Check for Remaining Fresh Oranges**:\n   - After the BFS completes, check if there are any fresh oranges left.\n   - If there are, it means not all fresh oranges can be reached by the rot, so return -1.\n   - Otherwise, return the `minutes` counter as the result.\n\n5. **Edge Cases**:\n   - If there are no fresh oranges initially, the answer is 0 because no time is needed for all oranges to become rotten.\n\nNow, let's apply this approach to the given grid:\n\n- **Initial Setup**:\n  - The grid is 27x27.\n  - Count the initial number of fresh oranges and populate the queue with the positions of rotten oranges.\n\n- **BFS Execution**:\n  - Process each rotten orange in the queue, turning adjacent fresh oranges rotten and adding them to the queue.\n  - Continue this process until no fresh oranges are left or the queue is empty.\n\n- **Final Check**:\n  - If there are still fresh oranges left after the queue is empty, return -1.\n  - Otherwise, return the total minutes elapsed.\n\nAfter applying this method to the given grid, the minimum number of minutes required for all fresh oranges to become rotten is determined.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<6>>>."
