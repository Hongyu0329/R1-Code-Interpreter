    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to model the spread of rot from initially rotten oranges to adjacent fresh oranges. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Initial State:**\n   - Traverse the grid to identify all initially rotten oranges (value 2) and add their positions to a queue. This queue will help us perform a BFS.\n   - Count the total number of fresh oranges (value 1) in the grid.\n\n2. **BFS Simulation:**\n   - Initialize a variable `minutes` to track the time elapsed.\n   - While the queue is not empty and there are fresh oranges remaining:\n     - For each rotten orange in the queue, check its 4-directional neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n     - If a neighbor is a fresh orange, it becomes rotten, and we add its position to a temporary queue for the next minute.\n     - Decrease the count of fresh oranges each time a fresh orange becomes rotten.\n     - After processing all oranges in the current queue, increment the `minutes` counter and replace the queue with the temporary queue.\n\n3. **Check for Remaining Fresh Oranges:**\n   - After the BFS completes, check if there are any fresh oranges left.\n   - If there are, it means not all fresh oranges can be reached by the rot, so return -1.\n   - Otherwise, return the `minutes` counter as the result.\n\n4. **Edge Cases:**\n   - If there are no fresh oranges initially, the answer is 0 because no time is needed.\n   - If there are no rotten oranges initially and there are fresh oranges, the answer is -1 because the fresh oranges can never become rotten.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the given grid:\n\n- **Initial Setup:**\n  - Count the fresh oranges and identify the initial rotten oranges.\n  - Add the positions of rotten oranges to the queue.\n\n- **BFS Execution:**\n  - Process each level of the queue, marking adjacent fresh oranges as rotten and adding them to the next level's queue.\n  - Increment the `minutes` counter after processing each level.\n\n- **Final Check:**\n  - If there are no fresh oranges left, return the `minutes` counter.\n  - If there are still fresh oranges, return -1.\n\nAfter simulating the process on the given grid, the minimum number of minutes required for all fresh oranges to become rotten is determined.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<13>>>."
