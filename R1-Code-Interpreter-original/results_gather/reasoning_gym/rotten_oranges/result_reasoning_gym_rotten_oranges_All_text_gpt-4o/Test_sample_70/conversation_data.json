    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to model the spread of rot from rotten oranges to adjacent fresh oranges. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Rotten Oranges**: \n   - Traverse the grid to find all the initial positions of rotten oranges (value 2). These will be our starting points for the BFS.\n   - Also, count the total number of fresh oranges (value 1) in the grid.\n\n2. **BFS Initialization**:\n   - Use a queue to perform BFS. Initialize the queue with all the positions of the initial rotten oranges.\n   - Keep track of the number of minutes elapsed, starting from 0.\n\n3. **BFS Process**:\n   - While the queue is not empty, process each level of the BFS (each minute):\n     - For each rotten orange in the queue, check its 4-directionally adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).\n     - If an adjacent cell contains a fresh orange, it becomes rotten. Add this new rotten orange to the queue for the next minute's processing.\n     - Decrease the count of fresh oranges by 1 for each fresh orange that becomes rotten.\n   - Increment the minute counter after processing all oranges in the current level of the queue.\n\n4. **Check for Remaining Fresh Oranges**:\n   - After the BFS completes, check if there are any fresh oranges left (i.e., if the count of fresh oranges is greater than 0).\n   - If there are no fresh oranges left, the number of minutes elapsed is the answer.\n   - If there are still fresh oranges left, it means some fresh oranges are isolated and cannot be reached by any rotten orange, so return -1.\n\n5. **Edge Cases**:\n   - If there are no fresh oranges to begin with, the answer is 0 minutes.\n   - If there are no rotten oranges initially and there are fresh oranges, the answer is -1 since the fresh oranges can never rot.\n\nNow, applying this process to the given grid:\n\n- Initial rotten oranges are located at positions: (0,8), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (5,9), (6,13), (7,10), (8,9), (10,0), (10,7), (12,2), (12,13), (13,5), (13,7).\n- Count of fresh oranges initially is 112.\n\nBy simulating the BFS process, we find that all fresh oranges can be rotted in 7 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange is:\n\n<<<7>>>"
