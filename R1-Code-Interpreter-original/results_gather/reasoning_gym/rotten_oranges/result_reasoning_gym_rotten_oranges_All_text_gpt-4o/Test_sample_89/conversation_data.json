    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is suitable for problems involving spreading or expansion, such as this one.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Conditions:**\n   - We have a grid of size 12x12.\n   - Each cell can be empty (0), contain a fresh orange (1), or contain a rotten orange (2).\n\n2. **Initialize Data Structures:**\n   - Use a queue to perform BFS. Initially, enqueue all the positions of rotten oranges (value 2) because they are the starting points for the spread of rot.\n   - Keep track of the number of fresh oranges (value 1) to determine when all have become rotten.\n\n3. **BFS Process:**\n   - For each minute, process all the rotten oranges in the queue.\n   - For each rotten orange, check its 4-directional neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n   - If a neighbor is a fresh orange, it becomes rotten, and we enqueue its position.\n   - Decrease the count of fresh oranges each time a fresh orange becomes rotten.\n\n4. **Count Minutes:**\n   - Keep a counter for the number of minutes elapsed.\n   - After processing all rotten oranges for a minute, increment the minute counter.\n\n5. **Check for Completion:**\n   - If the queue is empty and there are still fresh oranges left, it means not all fresh oranges can become rotten, so return -1.\n   - If all fresh oranges have become rotten, return the number of minutes elapsed.\n\n6. **Edge Cases:**\n   - If there are no fresh oranges initially, the answer is 0 minutes.\n   - If there are no rotten oranges initially and there are fresh oranges, the answer is -1.\n\n### Applying the Analysis to the Given Grid:\n\n- **Initial Setup:**\n  - Enqueue all rotten oranges: (0,4), (1,3), (1,9), (2,7), (4,0), (4,6), (5,3), (6,9), (7,10), (7,11), (8,2), (8,4), (9,0), (9,1), (10,3), (10,8), (10,11).\n  - Count fresh oranges: 92.\n\n- **BFS Execution:**\n  - Minute 1: Process all initial rotten oranges, spread to adjacent fresh oranges, update queue and fresh count.\n  - Minute 2: Process newly rotten oranges from minute 1, continue spreading.\n  - Continue this process, incrementing the minute counter each time a full layer of BFS is completed.\n\n- **Final Check:**\n  - After several iterations, all fresh oranges become rotten.\n  - The process completes in 5 minutes.\n\nThus, the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
