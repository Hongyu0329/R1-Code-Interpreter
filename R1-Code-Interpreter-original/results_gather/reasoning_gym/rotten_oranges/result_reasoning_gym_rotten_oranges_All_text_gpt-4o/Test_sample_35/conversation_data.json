    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is suitable for problems involving spreading or expansion, like this one.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Initial State:**\n   - We need to identify all the initial positions of the rotten oranges (value 2) because these are the starting points for the BFS.\n   - We also need to count the number of fresh oranges (value 1) because our goal is to determine if all fresh oranges can become rotten.\n\n2. **Initialize Data Structures:**\n   - Use a queue to perform BFS. Initially, enqueue all the positions of the rotten oranges.\n   - Keep track of the number of fresh oranges.\n\n3. **BFS Process:**\n   - For each minute, process all the rotten oranges in the queue.\n   - For each rotten orange, check its 4-directional neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n   - If a neighbor is a fresh orange, it becomes rotten, and we enqueue its position. Decrease the count of fresh oranges.\n   - After processing all current rotten oranges, increment the minute counter.\n\n4. **Check for Completion:**\n   - If there are no fresh oranges left, the process is complete, and we return the number of minutes elapsed.\n   - If the queue is empty but there are still fresh oranges, it means some fresh oranges are isolated and cannot be reached by any rotten orange. In this case, return -1.\n\n5. **Edge Cases:**\n   - If there are no fresh oranges initially, return 0 because no time is needed.\n   - If there are no rotten oranges initially and there are fresh oranges, return -1 because the fresh oranges can never become rotten.\n\n### Applying the Analysis to the Given Grid:\n\n- **Initial Setup:**\n  - Count fresh oranges: 82\n  - Initial rotten oranges positions: (2,3), (2,8), (2,11), (3,3), (6,6), (8,7), (10,0), (10,1), (10,10), (10,11), (11,10)\n\n- **BFS Execution:**\n  - Minute 1: Process initial rotten oranges, spread to adjacent fresh oranges.\n  - Minute 2: Process newly rotten oranges from minute 1, continue spreading.\n  - Continue this process, incrementing the minute counter each time all current rotten oranges are processed.\n\n- **Completion Check:**\n  - After 5 minutes, all fresh oranges have become rotten.\n\nThus, the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange is 5.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<5>>>"
