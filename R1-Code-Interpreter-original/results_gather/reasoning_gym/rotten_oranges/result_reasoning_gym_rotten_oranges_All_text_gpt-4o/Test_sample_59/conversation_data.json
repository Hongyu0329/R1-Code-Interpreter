    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is suitable for problems involving spreading or expansion, like this one.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Conditions:**\n   - We have a grid of size 12x12.\n   - Each cell can be empty (0), have a fresh orange (1), or have a rotten orange (2).\n\n2. **Initialize Data Structures:**\n   - Use a queue to perform BFS. Initially, enqueue all the positions of rotten oranges (value 2) because they are the starting points for the spread of rot.\n   - Keep track of the number of fresh oranges.\n\n3. **BFS Process:**\n   - For each minute, process all the rotten oranges in the queue.\n   - For each rotten orange, check its 4-directional neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n   - If a neighbor is a fresh orange (value 1), it becomes rotten (change its value to 2) and is added to the queue.\n   - Decrease the count of fresh oranges each time a fresh orange becomes rotten.\n\n4. **Count Minutes:**\n   - Each level of BFS represents one minute passing.\n   - Keep a counter to track the number of minutes.\n\n5. **Check for Completion:**\n   - If the queue is empty and there are still fresh oranges left, it means not all fresh oranges can become rotten, so return -1.\n   - If all fresh oranges have become rotten, return the number of minutes counted.\n\n6. **Edge Cases:**\n   - If there are no fresh oranges initially, return 0 because no time is needed.\n   - If there are no rotten oranges initially and there are fresh oranges, return -1 because the fresh oranges can never become rotten.\n\n### Execution:\n\n- Start by enqueuing all rotten oranges and counting fresh oranges.\n- Perform BFS, spreading the rot to adjacent fresh oranges.\n- Track the time taken for all fresh oranges to become rotten.\n- If any fresh oranges remain after the BFS completes, return -1.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nAfter simulating the process on the given grid, the minimum number of minutes required for all fresh oranges to become rotten is determined.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<4>>>"
