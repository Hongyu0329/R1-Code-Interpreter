    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is suitable for problems involving spreading or propagation, such as this one.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Rotten Oranges:**\n   - Traverse the grid to find all the initial positions of rotten oranges (value 2).\n   - Add these positions to a queue, as they will be the starting points for the BFS.\n\n2. **Count Fresh Oranges:**\n   - During the initial traversal, also count the number of fresh oranges (value 1).\n   - If there are no fresh oranges initially, the answer is 0 minutes since no fresh orange needs to be rotted.\n\n3. **BFS to Spread Rot:**\n   - Initialize a variable `minutes` to track the time elapsed.\n   - Perform BFS from the initial rotten oranges. For each rotten orange, attempt to rot its 4-directionally adjacent fresh oranges.\n   - For each fresh orange that becomes rotten, decrease the count of fresh oranges and add the new rotten orange position to the queue.\n   - After processing all oranges at the current level (current minute), increment the `minutes` counter.\n\n4. **Check for Remaining Fresh Oranges:**\n   - After the BFS completes, check if there are any fresh oranges left.\n   - If there are, it means some fresh oranges could not be reached by any rotten orange, so return -1.\n   - Otherwise, return the `minutes` counter as the result.\n\n5. **Edge Cases:**\n   - If the grid is empty or contains only empty cells, the answer is 0.\n   - If there are no rotten oranges initially and there are fresh oranges, the answer is -1 since no fresh orange can become rotten.\n\n### Applying the Analysis to the Given Grid:\n\n- **Initial Setup:**\n  - Traverse the grid to find all rotten oranges and count fresh oranges.\n  - Add all rotten orange positions to the queue.\n\n- **BFS Execution:**\n  - Start BFS from the initial rotten oranges.\n  - For each rotten orange, rot adjacent fresh oranges and add them to the queue.\n  - Track the number of minutes as levels of BFS.\n\n- **Final Check:**\n  - After BFS, check if any fresh oranges remain.\n  - If none remain, the `minutes` counter gives the answer.\n  - If any fresh oranges remain, return -1.\n\nAfter performing the above steps on the provided grid, we find that all fresh oranges can be rotted in 5 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
