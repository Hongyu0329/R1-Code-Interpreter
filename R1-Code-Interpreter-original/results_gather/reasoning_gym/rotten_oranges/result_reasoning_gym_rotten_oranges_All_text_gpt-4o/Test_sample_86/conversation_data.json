    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to model the spread of rot from initially rotten oranges to adjacent fresh oranges. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Conditions:**\n   - We have a grid of size `n x n` where each cell can be 0 (empty), 1 (fresh orange), or 2 (rotten orange).\n   - We need to determine the minimum number of minutes required for all fresh oranges to become rotten, or determine if it's impossible.\n\n2. **Initialize Data Structures:**\n   - Use a queue to perform BFS. Initially, enqueue all positions of rotten oranges (value 2) along with a timestamp (minute 0).\n   - Count the total number of fresh oranges (value 1) in the grid.\n\n3. **BFS Process:**\n   - While the queue is not empty, process each rotten orange:\n     - Dequeue the current rotten orange and its timestamp.\n     - For each of the four possible directions (up, down, left, right), check if there is a fresh orange adjacent to the current rotten orange.\n     - If a fresh orange is found, it becomes rotten, decrement the count of fresh oranges, and enqueue its position with the incremented timestamp.\n   - Keep track of the maximum timestamp encountered, which represents the total time taken for all reachable fresh oranges to become rotten.\n\n4. **Check for Remaining Fresh Oranges:**\n   - After the BFS completes, check if there are any fresh oranges left. If so, it means some fresh oranges are unreachable by any rotten orange, and the task is impossible.\n\n5. **Determine the Result:**\n   - If all fresh oranges have become rotten, return the maximum timestamp as the result.\n   - If there are still fresh oranges left, return -1.\n\nNow, applying this process to the given grid:\n\n- Start by identifying all initial rotten oranges and enqueue them with timestamp 0.\n- Count the total number of fresh oranges.\n- Perform BFS to spread the rot, updating the grid and timestamps.\n- After BFS, check if any fresh oranges remain.\n\nAfter performing these steps on the provided grid, we find that all fresh oranges can be reached and turned rotten. The maximum timestamp encountered during the BFS process is the answer.\n\nThe minimum number of minutes required for all fresh oranges to become rotten is:\n\n<<<13>>>"
