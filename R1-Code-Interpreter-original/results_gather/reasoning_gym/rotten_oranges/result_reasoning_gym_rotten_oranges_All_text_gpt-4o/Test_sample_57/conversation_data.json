    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is suitable for problems involving spreading or expansion, like this one.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Conditions:**\n   - We have a grid of size 12x12.\n   - Each cell can be empty (0), have a fresh orange (1), or have a rotten orange (2).\n\n2. **Initialize Data Structures:**\n   - Use a queue to perform BFS. Initially, enqueue all the positions of rotten oranges (value 2) because they are the starting points for the spread of rot.\n   - Keep track of the number of fresh oranges.\n\n3. **Count Fresh Oranges and Enqueue Rotten Oranges:**\n   - Traverse the grid to count the total number of fresh oranges.\n   - Enqueue all rotten oranges with their positions and the initial time (minute 0).\n\n4. **BFS to Spread Rot:**\n   - While the queue is not empty, process each rotten orange:\n     - Dequeue the current rotten orange and its time.\n     - For each of the four possible directions (up, down, left, right), check if the adjacent cell contains a fresh orange.\n     - If it does, turn it into a rotten orange, decrease the count of fresh oranges, and enqueue the new rotten orange with the incremented time.\n   - Keep track of the maximum time taken to rot all reachable fresh oranges.\n\n5. **Check for Remaining Fresh Oranges:**\n   - After the BFS completes, check if there are any fresh oranges left.\n   - If there are, it means some fresh oranges are unreachable by any rotten orange, so return -1.\n   - Otherwise, return the maximum time recorded during the BFS as the result.\n\n### Execution:\n\n- Start with the initial grid and identify all rotten oranges and count fresh oranges.\n- Use BFS to simulate the spread of rot.\n- Track the time taken for each orange to rot.\n- If any fresh oranges remain after the BFS, return -1.\n- Otherwise, return the maximum time taken.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nAfter performing the above steps on the given grid, the minimum number of minutes required for all fresh oranges to become rotten is determined. If any fresh oranges remain unreachable, the answer is -1.\n\nFor the provided grid, the BFS simulation shows that all fresh oranges can be reached and turned rotten in 5 minutes.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
