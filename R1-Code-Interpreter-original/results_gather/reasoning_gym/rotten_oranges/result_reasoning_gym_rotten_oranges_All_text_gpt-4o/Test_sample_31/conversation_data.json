    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to model the spread of rot from rotten oranges to adjacent fresh oranges. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initialize Data Structures**:\n   - Create a queue to store the positions of all initially rotten oranges. This will help us perform a BFS.\n   - Count the number of fresh oranges in the grid. This will help us determine if all fresh oranges have been rotted by the end of the process.\n\n2. **Populate Initial Queue**:\n   - Traverse the grid and add all rotten oranges (value 2) to the queue. Also, count the total number of fresh oranges (value 1).\n\n3. **BFS Process**:\n   - Initialize a variable `minutes` to track the time elapsed.\n   - While the queue is not empty and there are fresh oranges remaining:\n     - For each rotten orange in the queue, check its 4-directional neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n     - If a neighbor is a fresh orange, turn it rotten, decrease the fresh orange count, and add it to the queue.\n     - After processing all current rotten oranges, increment the `minutes` counter.\n\n4. **Check for Remaining Fresh Oranges**:\n   - After the BFS completes, check if there are any fresh oranges left.\n   - If there are fresh oranges remaining, it means not all fresh oranges can be rotted, so return -1.\n   - Otherwise, return the `minutes` counter as the result.\n\n5. **Edge Cases**:\n   - If there are no fresh oranges initially, return 0 as no time is needed.\n   - If there are no rotten oranges initially and there are fresh oranges, return -1 as it's impossible to rot any fresh orange.\n\nNow, applying this process to the given grid:\n\n- We start by identifying all the rotten oranges and counting the fresh ones.\n- We perform BFS from all rotten oranges simultaneously, rotting adjacent fresh oranges and counting the minutes.\n- After the BFS completes, we check if any fresh oranges remain.\n\nAfter performing these steps on the provided grid, we find that all fresh oranges can be rotted in 5 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
