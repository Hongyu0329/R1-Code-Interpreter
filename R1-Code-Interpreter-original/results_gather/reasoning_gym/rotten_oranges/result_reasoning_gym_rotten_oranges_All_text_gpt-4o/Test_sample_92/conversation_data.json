    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of rotting oranges over time. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to model the spread of rot from rotten oranges to adjacent fresh oranges. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Initial State**: \n   - We need to identify all the initial positions of rotten oranges (value 2) and fresh oranges (value 1).\n   - We will use a queue to keep track of the positions of rotten oranges, as they will be the starting points for the BFS.\n\n2. **Initialize the Queue**:\n   - Enqueue all the initial positions of rotten oranges along with a timestamp (minute) of 0, indicating the starting point of the rotting process.\n\n3. **Count Fresh Oranges**:\n   - Count the total number of fresh oranges at the start. This will help us determine if all fresh oranges have been rotted by the end of the process.\n\n4. **BFS Process**:\n   - While the queue is not empty, perform the following:\n     - Dequeue an element from the queue. This element contains the position of a rotten orange and the current minute.\n     - For each of the four possible directions (up, down, left, right), check if there is a fresh orange adjacent to the current rotten orange.\n     - If a fresh orange is found, it becomes rotten, and we enqueue its position with the incremented minute value.\n     - Decrease the count of fresh oranges by one each time a fresh orange becomes rotten.\n\n5. **Check Completion**:\n   - After the BFS completes, check if there are any fresh oranges left. If there are, it means not all fresh oranges could be rotted, and we return -1.\n   - If all fresh oranges have been rotted, the last minute value processed in the BFS will be the answer.\n\n6. **Edge Cases**:\n   - If there are no fresh oranges at the start, the answer is 0 because no time is needed to rot oranges.\n   - If there are no rotten oranges at the start and there are fresh oranges, the answer is -1 because the fresh oranges can never rot.\n\nNow, let's apply this process to the given grid:\n\n- **Initial Setup**:\n  - Identify all rotten oranges and enqueue them with minute 0.\n  - Count the total number of fresh oranges.\n\n- **BFS Execution**:\n  - Process each rotten orange in the queue, rotting adjacent fresh oranges and updating the queue with new rotten positions and incremented minute values.\n\n- **Final Check**:\n  - If all fresh oranges are rotted, return the last minute value.\n  - If any fresh oranges remain, return -1.\n\nAfter applying the above steps to the given grid, we find that all fresh oranges can be rotted in 6 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange is:\n\n<<<6>>>"
