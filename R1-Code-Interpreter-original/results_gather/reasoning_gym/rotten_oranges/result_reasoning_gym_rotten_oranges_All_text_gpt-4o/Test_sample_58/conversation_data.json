    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to model the spread of rot from rotten oranges to adjacent fresh oranges. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Initial State**: \n   - Traverse the grid to identify all the initial positions of rotten oranges (value 2) and count the number of fresh oranges (value 1).\n   - Store the positions of rotten oranges in a queue, as they will be the starting points for the BFS.\n\n2. **BFS Initialization**:\n   - Initialize a queue with all the initial rotten oranges.\n   - Initialize a variable `minutes` to track the time elapsed, starting at 0.\n   - Keep track of the number of fresh oranges.\n\n3. **BFS Process**:\n   - While the queue is not empty and there are fresh oranges remaining:\n     - For each rotten orange in the queue, check its 4-directionally adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).\n     - If an adjacent cell contains a fresh orange, it becomes rotten. Add this new rotten orange to the queue.\n     - Decrease the count of fresh oranges by 1 for each fresh orange that becomes rotten.\n   - After processing all oranges in the current queue, increment the `minutes` counter.\n\n4. **Check for Completion**:\n   - If there are no fresh oranges left, the process is complete, and the `minutes` variable contains the minimum time required.\n   - If the queue is empty but there are still fresh oranges, it means some fresh oranges are isolated and cannot be reached by any rotten orange. In this case, return -1.\n\n5. **Edge Cases**:\n   - If there are no fresh oranges initially, return 0 as no time is needed.\n   - If there are no rotten oranges initially and there are fresh oranges, return -1 as the fresh oranges can never become rotten.\n\nNow, applying this process to the given grid:\n\n- Start by identifying all initial rotten oranges and counting fresh oranges.\n- Use BFS to simulate the spread of rot, updating the grid and counting minutes.\n- Check if all fresh oranges have become rotten or if some remain unreachable.\n\nAfter performing these steps on the provided grid, we find that all fresh oranges can be reached and become rotten in 5 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
