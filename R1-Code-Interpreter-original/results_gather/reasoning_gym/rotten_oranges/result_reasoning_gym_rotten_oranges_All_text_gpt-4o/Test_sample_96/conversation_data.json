    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process of fresh oranges becoming rotten over time. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to model the spread of rot from rotten oranges to adjacent fresh oranges. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Initial State**: \n   - Traverse the grid to identify all the initial positions of rotten oranges (value 2) and fresh oranges (value 1).\n   - Count the total number of fresh oranges.\n\n2. **Initialize BFS Queue**:\n   - Use a queue to perform BFS. Initially, enqueue all the positions of rotten oranges along with a timestamp (minute) of 0, indicating the starting point of the spread.\n\n3. **BFS Process**:\n   - While the queue is not empty, perform the following:\n     - Dequeue an element from the queue, which gives the current position of a rotten orange and the current minute.\n     - Check all 4-directionally adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) to the current position.\n     - If an adjacent cell contains a fresh orange, it becomes rotten. Enqueue this new rotten orange position with the minute incremented by 1.\n     - Decrease the count of fresh oranges by 1 for each fresh orange that becomes rotten.\n\n4. **Check for Completion**:\n   - If the queue is empty and there are still fresh oranges left, it means not all fresh oranges can become rotten, so return -1.\n   - If all fresh oranges have become rotten, the last minute value processed in the BFS will be the answer.\n\n5. **Edge Cases**:\n   - If there are no fresh oranges initially, the answer is 0 because no time is needed for all oranges to become rotten.\n\nNow, let's apply this process to the given grid:\n\n- **Initial Setup**:\n  - Count fresh oranges and identify initial rotten oranges.\n  - Enqueue all rotten oranges with minute 0.\n\n- **BFS Execution**:\n  - Process each rotten orange, spreading the rot to adjacent fresh oranges.\n  - Track the time taken for each spread.\n\n- **Final Check**:\n  - If all fresh oranges are rotten, return the last minute value.\n  - If any fresh oranges remain, return -1.\n\nAfter performing these steps on the given grid, the minimum number of minutes required for all fresh oranges to become rotten is determined.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<4>>>"
