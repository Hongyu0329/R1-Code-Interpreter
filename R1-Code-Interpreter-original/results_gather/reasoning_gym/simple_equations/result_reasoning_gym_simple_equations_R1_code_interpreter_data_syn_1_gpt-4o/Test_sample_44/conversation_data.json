    "To solve for \\( l \\) in the equation \\( 1404l + 39 = 136227 \\), we need to isolate \\( l \\) on one side of the equation. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Subtract 39 from both sides of the equation to get:\n   \\[\n   1404l = 136227 - 39\n   \\]\n\n2. Simplify the right side:\n   \\[\n   1404l = 136188\n   \\]\n\n3. Divide both sides by 1404 to solve for \\( l \\):\n   \\[\n   l = \\frac{136188}{1404}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's compute the value of \\( l \\) using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of l\nl = (136227 - 39) / 1404\nprint(l)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the value of \\( l \\).",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the value of \\( l \\) as 97.0. This means that the solution to the equation \\( 1404l + 39 = 136227 \\) is \\( l = 97 \\).\n\n<<<97>>>"
