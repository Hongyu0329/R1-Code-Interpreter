    "To solve the equation \\(31a + 119 = 646\\), we need to isolate the variable \\(a\\). Here are the steps to solve for \\(a\\):\n\n1. Subtract 119 from both sides of the equation to get:\n   \\[\n   31a = 646 - 119\n   \\]\n\n2. Divide both sides by 31 to solve for \\(a\\):\n   \\[\n   a = \\frac{646 - 119}{31}\n   \\]\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of a\na = (646 - 119) / 31\nprint(a)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the value of \\(a\\).",
    "The code execution output indicates that the value of \\(a\\) is 17.0. Since \\(a\\) is an integer in the context of this equation, we can conclude that \\(a = 17\\).\n\n<<<17>>>"
