    "To solve the equation \\(78x - 161 = 2491\\), we need to isolate \\(x\\). Here is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Add 161 to both sides**: This will help eliminate the constant term on the left side of the equation.\n   \\[\n   78x - 161 + 161 = 2491 + 161\n   \\]\n   Simplifying gives:\n   \\[\n   78x = 2652\n   \\]\n\n2. **Divide both sides by 78**: This will solve for \\(x\\).\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{2652}{78}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of \\(x\\) using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of x\nx = 2652 / 78\nprint(x)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the value of \\(x\\).",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the value of \\(x\\) as 34.0. Therefore, the value of \\(x\\) that satisfies the equation \\(78x - 161 = 2491\\) is:\n\n<<<34>>>"
