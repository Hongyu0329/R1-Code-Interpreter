    "To solve the equation \\(3343 - 2520 \\times g = -69737\\), we need to isolate the variable \\(g\\).\n\n### Steps to solve the equation:\n\n1. **Move the constant term to the other side**: \n   \\[\n   3343 - 2520 \\times g = -69737 \\implies -2520 \\times g = -69737 - 3343\n   \\]\n\n2. **Simplify the right side**:\n   \\[\n   -2520 \\times g = -69737 - 3343\n   \\]\n\n3. **Divide both sides by -2520 to solve for \\(g\\)**:\n   \\[\n   g = \\frac{-69737 - 3343}{-2520}\n   \\]\n\nLet's compute this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the constants\nconstant_term = 3343\ncoefficient_of_g = 2520\nright_side = -69737\n\n# Calculate g\ng = (right_side - constant_term) / -coefficient_of_g\nprint(g)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the value of \\(g\\).",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the value of \\(g\\) as 29.0. This means that when \\(g = 29.0\\), the equation \\(3343 - 2520 \\times g = -69737\\) holds true.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<29.0>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
