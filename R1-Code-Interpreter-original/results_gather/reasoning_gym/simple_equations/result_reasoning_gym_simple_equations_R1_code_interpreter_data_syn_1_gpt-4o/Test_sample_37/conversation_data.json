    "To solve the equation \\(78v + 22 = 5560\\), we need to isolate the variable \\(v\\). Here are the steps:\n\n1. Subtract 22 from both sides of the equation to get rid of the constant term on the left side.\n2. Divide the result by 78 to solve for \\(v\\).\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Given equation: 78*v + 22 = 5560\n\n# Step 1: Subtract 22 from both sides\nleft_side = 5560 - 22\n\n# Step 2: Divide by 78 to solve for v\nv = left_side / 78\n\n# Output the result\nprint(v)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the value of \\(v\\).",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is 71.0. This means that the value of \\(v\\) that satisfies the equation \\(78v + 22 = 5560\\) is 71. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<71>>>"
