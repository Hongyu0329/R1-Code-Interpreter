    "To solve the equation \\(51a + 99 = 4791\\), we need to isolate the variable \\(a\\). Here are the steps to solve for \\(a\\):\n\n1. Subtract 99 from both sides of the equation to get rid of the constant term on the left side.\n2. Divide the result by 51 to solve for \\(a\\).\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Given equation: 51*a + 99 = 4791\n\n# Step 1: Subtract 99 from both sides\nresult_after_subtraction = 4791 - 99\n\n# Step 2: Divide the result by 51 to solve for a\na = result_after_subtraction / 51\n\n# Output the value of a\nprint(a)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the value of \\(a\\).",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the value of \\(a\\) as 92.0. Since \\(a\\) is an integer in this context, we can conclude that the value of \\(a\\) is 92.\n\n<<<92>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Find the value of a in the equation: 51*a + 99 = 4791\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",
