    "To find the value of \\( c \\) in the equation \\( 82c - 152 = 258 \\), we need to solve for \\( c \\). \n\nFirst, we can isolate the term with \\( c \\) on one side of the equation. We do this by adding 152 to both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ 82c - 152 + 152 = 258 + 152 \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 82c = 410 \\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( c \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 82:\n\n\\[ c = \\frac{410}{82} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of \\( c \\) using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of c\nc = 410 / 82\nprint(c)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the value of \\( c \\).",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the value of \\( c \\) as 5.0. Therefore, the solution to the equation \\( 82c - 152 = 258 \\) is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
