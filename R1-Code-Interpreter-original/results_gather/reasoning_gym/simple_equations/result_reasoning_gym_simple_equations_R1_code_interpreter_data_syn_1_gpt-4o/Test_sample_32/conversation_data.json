  "response_list": [
    "To find the value of \\( p \\) in the equation \\( 5589 \\times p = 16767 \\), we need to isolate \\( p \\). This can be done by dividing both sides of the equation by 5589.\n\nThe equation becomes:\n\n\\[ p = \\frac{16767}{5589} \\]\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of p\np = 16767 / 5589\nprint(p)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the value of \\( p \\).",
    "The code execution has provided the value of \\( p \\) as 3.0. This means that when you multiply 5589 by 3, you get 16767, confirming that the solution is correct.\n\n<<<3.0>>>"
