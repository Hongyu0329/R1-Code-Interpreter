    "To find the value of \\( c \\) in the equation \\( 20 - 11c = -409 \\), we need to solve for \\( c \\). \n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with the equation: \n   \\[\n   20 - 11c = -409\n   \\]\n\n2. Subtract 20 from both sides to isolate the term with \\( c \\):\n   \\[\n   -11c = -409 - 20\n   \\]\n\n3. Simplify the right side:\n   \\[\n   -11c = -429\n   \\]\n\n4. Divide both sides by -11 to solve for \\( c \\):\n   \\[\n   c = \\frac{-429}{-11}\n   \\]\n\n5. Simplify the division to find the value of \\( c \\).\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of c\nc = -429 / -11\nprint(c)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the value of \\( c \\).",
    "The calculation confirms that the value of \\( c \\) is 39.0. Since \\( c \\) is typically an integer in such equations, we can conclude that \\( c = 39 \\).\n\n<<<39>>>"
