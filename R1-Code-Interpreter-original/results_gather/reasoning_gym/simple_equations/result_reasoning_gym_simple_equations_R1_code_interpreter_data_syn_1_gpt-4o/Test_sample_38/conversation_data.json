    "To solve the equation \\(2478 \\cdot d + 58 = 215644\\), we need to isolate \\(d\\). \n\nFirst, subtract 58 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[2478 \\cdot d = 215644 - 58\\]\n\nNext, divide both sides by 2478 to solve for \\(d\\):\n\n\\[d = \\frac{215644 - 58}{2478}\\]\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of d\nd = (215644 - 58) / 2478\nprint(d)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, we will have the value of \\(d\\).",
    "The calculation has been completed successfully, and the value of \\(d\\) is 87.0. Since \\(d\\) is an integer, we can conclude that the solution to the equation is:\n\n<<<87>>>"
