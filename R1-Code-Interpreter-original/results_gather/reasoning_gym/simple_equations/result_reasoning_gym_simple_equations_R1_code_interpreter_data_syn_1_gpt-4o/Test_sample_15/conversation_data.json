    "To solve the equation \\(74l + 56 = 4940\\) for \\(l\\), we need to isolate \\(l\\) on one side of the equation. Here is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Subtract 56 from both sides of the equation to get rid of the constant term on the left side:\n   \\[\n   74l = 4940 - 56\n   \\]\n\n2. Simplify the right side:\n   \\[\n   74l = 4884\n   \\]\n\n3. Divide both sides by 74 to solve for \\(l\\):\n   \\[\n   l = \\frac{4884}{74}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of \\(l\\) using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of l\nl = (4940 - 56) / 74\nprint(l)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the value of \\(l\\).",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the value of \\( l \\) as 66.0. This means that the solution to the equation \\( 74l + 56 = 4940 \\) is \\( l = 66 \\).\n\n<<<66>>>"
