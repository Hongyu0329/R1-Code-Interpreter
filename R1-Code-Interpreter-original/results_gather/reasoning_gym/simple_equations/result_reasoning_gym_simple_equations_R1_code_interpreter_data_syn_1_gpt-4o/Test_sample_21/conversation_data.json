    "To solve the equation \\(59 - 92t = -8589\\), we need to isolate the variable \\(t\\). Here is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with the equation:  \n   \\(59 - 92t = -8589\\)\n\n2. Subtract 59 from both sides to isolate the term with \\(t\\):  \n   \\(-92t = -8589 - 59\\)\n\n3. Simplify the right side:  \n   \\(-92t = -8648\\)\n\n4. Divide both sides by -92 to solve for \\(t\\):  \n   \\(t = \\frac{-8648}{-92}\\)\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of \\(t\\) using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of t\nt = -8648 / -92\nprint(t)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the value of \\(t\\).",
    "The code execution has provided the value of \\(t\\) as 94.0. This means that the solution to the equation \\(59 - 92t = -8589\\) is \\(t = 94\\).\n\n<<<94>>>"
