    "To find the value of \\( y \\) in the equation \\( 4y + 231 = 375 \\), we need to isolate \\( y \\) on one side of the equation. Here are the steps to solve for \\( y \\):\n\n1. Subtract 231 from both sides of the equation to get rid of the constant term on the left side:\n   \\[\n   4y + 231 - 231 = 375 - 231\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this gives:\n   \\[\n   4y = 144\n   \\]\n\n2. Divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for \\( y \\):\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{144}{4}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of \\( y \\) using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of y\ny = (375 - 231) / 4\nprint(y)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the value of \\( y \\).",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the value of \\( y \\) as 36.0. Since we are dealing with a simple linear equation, the result is a whole number, and the decimal point indicates that the division was performed. \n\nTherefore, the value of \\( y \\) is:\n\n<<<36>>>"
