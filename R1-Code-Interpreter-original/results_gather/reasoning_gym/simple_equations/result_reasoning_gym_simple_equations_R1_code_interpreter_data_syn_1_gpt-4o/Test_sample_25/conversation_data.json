    "To solve the equation \\(66b + 75 = 3771\\), we need to isolate the variable \\(b\\).\n\n### Steps to solve the equation:\n\n1. **Subtract 75 from both sides**: This will help in isolating the term with \\(b\\).\n   \\[\n   66b + 75 - 75 = 3771 - 75\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   66b = 3696\n   \\]\n\n2. **Divide both sides by 66**: This will give us the value of \\(b\\).\n   \\[\n   b = \\frac{3696}{66}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of \\(b\\) using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of b\nb = (3771 - 75) / 66\nprint(b)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the value of \\(b\\).",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the value of \\(b\\) as 56.0. Therefore, the value of \\(b\\) that satisfies the equation \\(66b + 75 = 3771\\) is 56.\n\n<<<56>>>"
