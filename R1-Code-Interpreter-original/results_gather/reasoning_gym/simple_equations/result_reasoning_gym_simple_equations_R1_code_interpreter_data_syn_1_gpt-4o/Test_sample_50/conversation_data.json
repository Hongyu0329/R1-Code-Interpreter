    "To solve the equation \\(88e + 15 = 455\\), we need to isolate the variable \\(e\\). Here is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Subtract 15 from both sides of the equation to get rid of the constant term on the left side:\n   \\[\n   88e + 15 - 15 = 455 - 15\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this gives:\n   \\[\n   88e = 440\n   \\]\n\n2. Divide both sides by 88 to solve for \\(e\\):\n   \\[\n   e = \\frac{440}{88}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of \\(e\\) using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of e\ne = 440 / 88\nprint(e)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the value of \\(e\\).",
    "The code execution output indicates that the value of \\(e\\) is 5.0. This means that when you solve the equation \\(88e + 15 = 455\\), the value of \\(e\\) is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
