    "To solve the equation \\( 2555b - 9 = 219721 \\), we need to isolate the variable \\( b \\).\n\n### Steps to solve the equation:\n\n1. **Add 9 to both sides**: This will eliminate the -9 on the left side of the equation.\n   \\[\n   2555b = 219721 + 9\n   \\]\n\n2. **Simplify the right side**: Calculate the sum on the right side.\n   \\[\n   2555b = 219730\n   \\]\n\n3. **Divide both sides by 2555**: This will solve for \\( b \\).\n   \\[\n   b = \\frac{219730}{2555}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of \\( b \\) using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of b\nb = (219721 + 9) / 2555\nprint(b)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the value of \\( b \\).",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the value of \\( b \\) as 86.0. This means that the solution to the equation \\( 2555b - 9 = 219721 \\) is \\( b = 86 \\).\n\n<<<86>>>"
