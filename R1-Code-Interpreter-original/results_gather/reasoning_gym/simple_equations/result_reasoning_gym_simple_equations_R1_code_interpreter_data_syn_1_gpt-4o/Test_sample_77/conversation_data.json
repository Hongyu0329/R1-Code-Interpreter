    "To solve the equation \\(13i + 58 = 890\\), we need to isolate the variable \\(i\\). We can do this by following these steps:\n\n1. Subtract 58 from both sides of the equation to get rid of the constant term on the left side.\n2. Divide the result by 13 to solve for \\(i\\).\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the constants\na = 13\nb = 58\nc = 890\n\n# Calculate the value of i\ni = (c - b) / a\n\n# Print the result\nprint(i)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the value of \\(i\\).",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the value of \\(i\\) as 64.0. This means that the solution to the equation \\(13i + 58 = 890\\) is \\(i = 64\\).\n\n<<<64>>>"
