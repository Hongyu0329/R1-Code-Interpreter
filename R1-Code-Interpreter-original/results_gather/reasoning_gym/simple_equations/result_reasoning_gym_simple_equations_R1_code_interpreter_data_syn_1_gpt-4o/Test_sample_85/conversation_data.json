    "To find the value of \\( h \\) in the equation \\( 22 - 21h = -1868 \\), we need to isolate \\( h \\) on one side of the equation. Here are the steps to solve for \\( h \\):\n\n1. Subtract 22 from both sides of the equation to get rid of the constant term on the left side:\n   \\[\n   22 - 21h - 22 = -1868 - 22\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this gives:\n   \\[\n   -21h = -1890\n   \\]\n\n2. Divide both sides by -21 to solve for \\( h \\):\n   \\[\n   h = \\frac{-1890}{-21}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of \\( h \\) using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of h\nh = -1890 / -21\nprint(h)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the value of \\( h \\).",
    "The code execution has provided the value of \\( h \\) as 90.0. This means that the solution to the equation \\( 22 - 21h = -1868 \\) is \\( h = 90 \\).\n\n<<<90>>>"
