    "To solve the equation \\(264h + 18 = 18498\\), we need to isolate the variable \\(h\\). Here are the steps to solve for \\(h\\):\n\n1. Subtract 18 from both sides of the equation to get rid of the constant term on the left side.\n2. Divide both sides by 264 to solve for \\(h\\).\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Subtract 18 from both sides\nleft_side = 264\nright_side = 18498 - 18\n\n# Step 2: Divide both sides by 264 to solve for h\nh = right_side / left_side\n\n# Output the result\nprint(h)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the value of \\(h\\).",
    "The code execution has provided the value of \\( h \\) as 70.0. This means that when you solve the equation \\( 264h + 18 = 18498 \\), the value of \\( h \\) is 70.\n\n<<<70>>>"
