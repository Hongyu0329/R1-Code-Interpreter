    "To find the value of \\( q \\) in the equation \\( 12q + 25 = 361 \\), we need to isolate \\( q \\) on one side of the equation. Here are the steps to solve for \\( q \\):\n\n1. Subtract 25 from both sides of the equation to get rid of the constant term on the left side:\n   \\[\n   12q + 25 - 25 = 361 - 25\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this gives:\n   \\[\n   12q = 336\n   \\]\n\n2. Divide both sides of the equation by 12 to solve for \\( q \\):\n   \\[\n   q = \\frac{336}{12}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of \\( q \\) using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of q\nq = (361 - 25) / 12\nprint(q)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the value of \\( q \\).",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the value of \\( q \\) as 28.0. Since \\( q \\) is an integer in this context, we can express the final answer as an integer.\n\n<<<28>>>"
