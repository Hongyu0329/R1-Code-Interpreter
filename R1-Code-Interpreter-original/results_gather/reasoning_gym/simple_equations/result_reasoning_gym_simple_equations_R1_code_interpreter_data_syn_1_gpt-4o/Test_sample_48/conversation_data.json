    "To solve the equation \\(124 - 47i = -3213\\), we need to isolate the variable \\(i\\). \n\nFirst, let's move the constant term (124) to the right side of the equation by subtracting 124 from both sides:\n\n\\[ -47i = -3213 - 124 \\]\n\nNext, we simplify the right side of the equation:\n\n\\[ -47i = -3337 \\]\n\nNow, to solve for \\(i\\), we divide both sides by -47:\n\n\\[ i = \\frac{-3337}{-47} \\]\n\nLet's calculate the value of \\(i\\) using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of i\ni = -3337 / -47\nprint(i)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the value of \\(i\\).",
    "The code execution output indicates that the value of \\(i\\) is 71.0. This means that when you solve the equation \\(124 - 47i = -3213\\), the value of \\(i\\) is 71.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<71>>>"
