    "To solve the equation \\(12o + 71 = 1091\\), we need to isolate the variable \\(o\\). Here is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Subtract 71 from both sides of the equation to get rid of the constant term on the left side:\n   \\[\n   12o + 71 - 71 = 1091 - 71\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this gives:\n   \\[\n   12o = 1020\n   \\]\n\n2. Divide both sides by 12 to solve for \\(o\\):\n   \\[\n   o = \\frac{1020}{12}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of \\(o\\) using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of o\no = (1091 - 71) / 12\nprint(o)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the value of \\(o\\).",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the value of \\(o\\) as 85.0. Since \\(o\\) is an integer in the context of this equation, we can conclude that the value of \\(o\\) is 85.\n\n<<<85>>>"
