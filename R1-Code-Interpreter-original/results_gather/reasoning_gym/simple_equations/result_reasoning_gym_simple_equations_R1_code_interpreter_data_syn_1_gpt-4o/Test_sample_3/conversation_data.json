    "To find the value of \\( r \\) in the equation \\( 1920r + 9312 = 149472 \\), we need to isolate \\( r \\). We can do this by following these steps:\n\n1. Subtract 9312 from both sides of the equation to get:\n   \\[\n   1920r = 149472 - 9312\n   \\]\n\n2. Divide both sides by 1920 to solve for \\( r \\):\n   \\[\n   r = \\frac{149472 - 9312}{1920}\n   \\]\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the constants\na = 1920\nb = 9312\nc = 149472\n\n# Calculate the value of r\nr = (c - b) / a\n\n# Print the result\nprint(r)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the value of \\( r \\).",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the value of \\( r \\) as 73.0. This means that when you solve the equation \\( 1920r + 9312 = 149472 \\), the value of \\( r \\) is 73.\n\n<<<73>>>"
