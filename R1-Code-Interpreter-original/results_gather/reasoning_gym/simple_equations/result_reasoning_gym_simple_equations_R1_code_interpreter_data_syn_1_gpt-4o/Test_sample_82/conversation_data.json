    "To find the value of \\( h \\) in the equation \\( 20h - 162 = 1338 \\), we need to solve for \\( h \\). \n\nFirst, let's isolate the term with \\( h \\) on one side of the equation:\n\n1. Add 162 to both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant term on the left side:\n   \\[\n   20h - 162 + 162 = 1338 + 162\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this gives:\n   \\[\n   20h = 1500\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, divide both sides by 20 to solve for \\( h \\):\n   \\[\n   h = \\frac{1500}{20}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of \\( h \\) using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of h\nh = (1338 + 162) / 20\nprint(h)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the value of \\( h \\).",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the value of \\( h \\) as 75.0. Therefore, the solution to the equation \\( 20h - 162 = 1338 \\) is:\n\n<<<75>>>"
