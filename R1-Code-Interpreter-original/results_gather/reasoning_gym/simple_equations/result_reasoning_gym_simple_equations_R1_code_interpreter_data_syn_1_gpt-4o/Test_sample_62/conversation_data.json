  "response_list": [
    "To solve for \\( r \\) in the equation \\( 896 \\times r = 78848 \\), we need to isolate \\( r \\). This can be done by dividing both sides of the equation by 896. The equation becomes:\n\n\\[ r = \\frac{78848}{896} \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( r \\), we can perform this division. Let's calculate it using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of r\nr = 78848 / 896\nprint(r)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the value of \\( r \\).",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the value of \\( r \\) as 88.0. Therefore, the solution to the equation \\( 896 \\times r = 78848 \\) is:\n\n<<<88>>>"
