    "To solve the equation \\(74 - 32s = -1878\\), we need to isolate the variable \\(s\\). Here are the steps to solve for \\(s\\):\n\n1. Subtract 74 from both sides of the equation to get:\n   \\(-32s = -1878 - 74\\)\n\n2. Simplify the right side:\n   \\(-32s = -1952\\)\n\n3. Divide both sides by -32 to solve for \\(s\\):\n   \\(s = \\frac{-1952}{-32}\\)\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of \\(s\\) using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of s\ns = -1952 / -32\nprint(s)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the value of \\(s\\).",
    "The code execution has provided the value of \\(s\\) as 61.0. Therefore, the solution to the equation \\(74 - 32s = -1878\\) is:\n\n<<<61>>>"
