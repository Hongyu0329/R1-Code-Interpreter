    "To find the value of \\( w \\) in the equation \\( 24w + 68 = 284 \\), we need to isolate \\( w \\) on one side of the equation. Here is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with the equation:  \n   \\( 24w + 68 = 284 \\)\n\n2. Subtract 68 from both sides to isolate the term with \\( w \\):  \n   \\( 24w = 284 - 68 \\)\n\n3. Simplify the right side:  \n   \\( 24w = 216 \\)\n\n4. Divide both sides by 24 to solve for \\( w \\):  \n   \\( w = \\frac{216}{24} \\)\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of \\( w \\) using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of w\nw = (284 - 68) / 24\nprint(w)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the value of \\( w \\).",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the value of \\( w \\) as 9.0. This means that the solution to the equation \\( 24w + 68 = 284 \\) is \\( w = 9 \\).\n\n<<<9>>>"
