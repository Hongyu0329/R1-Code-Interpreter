    "To solve the equation \\(-62h - 2256 = -6596\\), we need to isolate the variable \\(h\\). Here are the steps to solve for \\(h\\):\n\n1. Add 2256 to both sides of the equation to move the constant term on the left side to the right side.\n2. Divide both sides by -62 to solve for \\(h\\).\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Given equation: -62*h - 2256 = -6596\n\n# Step 1: Move the constant term to the right side\nright_side = -6596 + 2256\n\n# Step 2: Divide by the coefficient of h\nh = right_side / -62\n\n# Output the value of h\nprint(h)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the value of \\(h\\).",
    "The code executed successfully, and the value of \\( h \\) was calculated to be 70.0. Therefore, the solution to the equation \\(-62h - 2256 = -6596\\) is:\n\n<<<70>>>"
