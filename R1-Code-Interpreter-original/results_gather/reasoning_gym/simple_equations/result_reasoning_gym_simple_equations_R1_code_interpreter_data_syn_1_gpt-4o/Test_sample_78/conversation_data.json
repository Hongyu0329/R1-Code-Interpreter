    "To solve the equation \\(82m - 113 = 3249\\), we need to isolate the variable \\(m\\). Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Start with the equation: \n   \\[\n   82m - 113 = 3249\n   \\]\n\n2. Add 113 to both sides to eliminate the constant term on the left:\n   \\[\n   82m = 3249 + 113\n   \\]\n\n3. Simplify the right side:\n   \\[\n   82m = 3362\n   \\]\n\n4. Divide both sides by 82 to solve for \\(m\\):\n   \\[\n   m = \\frac{3362}{82}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of \\(m\\) using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of m\nm = (3249 + 113) / 82\nprint(m)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the value of \\(m\\).",
    "The code execution output indicates that the value of \\( m \\) is 41.0. This means that the integer value of \\( m \\) that satisfies the equation \\( 82m - 113 = 3249 \\) is 41.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<41>>>"
