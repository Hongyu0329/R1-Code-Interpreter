    "To solve the equation \\(50e - 14 = 4636\\), we need to isolate the variable \\(e\\). We can do this by following these steps:\n\n1. Add 14 to both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant term on the left side.\n2. Divide both sides by 50 to solve for \\(e\\).\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Given equation: 50*e - 14 = 4636\n\n# Step 1: Add 14 to both sides\nright_side = 4636 + 14\n\n# Step 2: Divide by 50 to solve for e\ne = right_side / 50\n\n# Output the result\nprint(e)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the value of \\(e\\).",
