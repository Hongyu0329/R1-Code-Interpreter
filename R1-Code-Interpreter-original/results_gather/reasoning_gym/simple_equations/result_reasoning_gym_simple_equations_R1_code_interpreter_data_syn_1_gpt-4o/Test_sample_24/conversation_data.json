    "To solve the equation \\(61 - 99r = -5285\\), we need to isolate the variable \\(r\\). Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Start by moving the constant term (61) to the other side of the equation by subtracting 61 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   -99r = -5285 - 61\n   \\]\n\n2. Simplify the right side of the equation:\n   \\[\n   -99r = -5346\n   \\]\n\n3. To solve for \\(r\\), divide both sides by -99:\n   \\[\n   r = \\frac{-5346}{-99}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of \\(r\\) using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of r\nr = -5346 / -99\nprint(r)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the value of \\(r\\).",
    "The code execution has provided the value of \\( r \\) as 54.0. This means that the value of \\( r \\) that satisfies the equation \\( 61 - 99r = -5285 \\) is 54.\n\n<<<54>>>"
