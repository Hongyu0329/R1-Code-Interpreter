    "To solve the equation \\(9u + 4 = 58\\), we need to isolate the variable \\(u\\). Here are the steps:\n\n1. Subtract 4 from both sides of the equation to get rid of the constant term on the left side.\n2. Divide both sides by 9 to solve for \\(u\\).\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the equation parameters\na = 9\nb = 4\nc = 58\n\n# Calculate the value of u\nu = (c - b) / a\n\n# Print the result\nprint(u)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the value of \\(u\\).",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the value of \\(u\\) as 6.0. This means that the value of \\(u\\) that satisfies the equation \\(9u + 4 = 58\\) is 6.\n\n<<<6>>>"
