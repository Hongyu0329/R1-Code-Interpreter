    "To solve the equation \\(61008 \\cdot g - 74 = 2440246\\), we need to isolate \\(g\\). Here are the steps:\n\n1. Add 74 to both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant term on the left side:\n   \\[\n   61008 \\cdot g = 2440246 + 74\n   \\]\n\n2. Simplify the right side:\n   \\[\n   61008 \\cdot g = 2440320\n   \\]\n\n3. Divide both sides by 61008 to solve for \\(g\\):\n   \\[\n   g = \\frac{2440320}{61008}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's compute the value of \\(g\\) using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of g\ng = (2440246 + 74) / 61008\nprint(g)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the value of \\(g\\).",
    "The code execution has provided the value of \\(g\\) as 40.0. This means that when you solve the equation \\(61008 \\cdot g - 74 = 2440246\\), the value of \\(g\\) is 40.\n\n<<<40>>>"
