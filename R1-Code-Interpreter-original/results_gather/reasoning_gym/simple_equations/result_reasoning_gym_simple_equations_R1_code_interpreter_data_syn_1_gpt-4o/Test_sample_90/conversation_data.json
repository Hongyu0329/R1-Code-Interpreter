    "To solve the equation \\(94q + 39 = 2765\\), we need to isolate the variable \\(q\\). Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Subtract 39 from both sides**: This will help in isolating the term with \\(q\\).\n   \\[\n   94q + 39 - 39 = 2765 - 39\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this gives:\n   \\[\n   94q = 2726\n   \\]\n\n2. **Divide both sides by 94**: This will solve for \\(q\\).\n   \\[\n   q = \\frac{2726}{94}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's compute the value of \\(q\\) using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of q\nq = (2765 - 39) / 94\nprint(q)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the value of \\(q\\).",
    "The code execution output indicates that the value of \\( q \\) is 29.0. This means that the solution to the equation \\( 94q + 39 = 2765 \\) is \\( q = 29 \\).\n\n<<<29>>>"
