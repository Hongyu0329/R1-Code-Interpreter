    "To solve the equation \\( 89m + 52 = 8418 \\), we need to isolate the variable \\( m \\).\n\n### Steps to solve the equation:\n\n1. **Subtract 52 from both sides**: This will help in isolating the term with \\( m \\).\n   \\[\n   89m = 8418 - 52\n   \\]\n\n2. **Divide both sides by 89**: This will give us the value of \\( m \\).\n   \\[\n   m = \\frac{8418 - 52}{89}\n   \\]\n\nLet's calculate the value of \\( m \\) using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of m\nm = (8418 - 52) / 89\nprint(m)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the value of \\( m \\).",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the value of \\( m \\) as 94.0. Since \\( m \\) is an integer in the context of this equation, we can conclude that the value of \\( m \\) is 94.\n\n<<<94>>>"
