    "To find the value of \\( u \\) in the equation \\( 32u + 4 = 3044 \\), we need to isolate \\( u \\) on one side of the equation. Here are the steps to solve for \\( u \\):\n\n1. Subtract 4 from both sides of the equation to get rid of the constant term on the left side.\n2. Divide both sides by 32 to solve for \\( u \\).\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Given equation: 32*u + 4 = 3044\n\n# Step 1: Subtract 4 from both sides\nleft_side = 3044 - 4\n\n# Step 2: Divide by 32 to solve for u\nu = left_side / 32\n\n# Output the result\nprint(u)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the value of \\( u \\).",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the value of \\( u \\) as 95.0. This means that the solution to the equation \\( 32u + 4 = 3044 \\) is \\( u = 95 \\).\n\n<<<95>>>"
