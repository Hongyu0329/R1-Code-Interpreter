    "To solve the equation \\(99z + 41 = 6476\\), we need to isolate \\(z\\). We can do this by following these steps:\n\n1. Subtract 41 from both sides of the equation to get:\n   \\[\n   99z = 6476 - 41\n   \\]\n\n2. Divide both sides by 99 to solve for \\(z\\):\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{6476 - 41}{99}\n   \\]\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of z\nz = (6476 - 41) / 99\nprint(z)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, we will have the value of \\(z\\).",
    "The code execution has provided the value of \\(z\\) as 65.0. Since \\(z\\) is an integer in this context, we can conclude that the solution to the equation \\(99z + 41 = 6476\\) is:\n\n<<<65>>>"
