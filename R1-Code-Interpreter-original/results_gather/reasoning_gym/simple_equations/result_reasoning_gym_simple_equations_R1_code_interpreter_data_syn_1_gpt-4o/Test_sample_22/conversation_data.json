    "To solve the equation \\(49e + 134 = 4740\\), we need to isolate the variable \\(e\\). We can do this by following these steps:\n\n1. Subtract 134 from both sides of the equation to get rid of the constant term on the left side.\n2. Divide the result by 49 to solve for \\(e\\).\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Given equation: 49*e + 134 = 4740\n\n# Step 1: Subtract 134 from both sides\nleft_side = 4740 - 134\n\n# Step 2: Divide the result by 49 to solve for e\ne = left_side / 49\n\n# Output the result\nprint(e)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the value of \\(e\\).",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the value of \\(e\\) as 94.0. This means that when you solve the equation \\(49e + 134 = 4740\\), the value of \\(e\\) is 94.\n\n<<<94>>>"
