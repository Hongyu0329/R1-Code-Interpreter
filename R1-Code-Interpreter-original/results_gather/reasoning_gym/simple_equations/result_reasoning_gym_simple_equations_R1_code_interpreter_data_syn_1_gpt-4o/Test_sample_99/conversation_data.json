    "To solve the equation \\(37k + 87 = 679\\), we need to isolate the variable \\(k\\). Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Subtract 87 from both sides of the equation to get:\n   \\[\n   37k = 679 - 87\n   \\]\n\n2. Simplify the right side:\n   \\[\n   37k = 592\n   \\]\n\n3. Divide both sides by 37 to solve for \\(k\\):\n   \\[\n   k = \\frac{592}{37}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's compute the value of \\(k\\) using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of k\nk = (679 - 87) / 37\nprint(k)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the value of \\(k\\).",
    "The code execution output indicates that the value of \\(k\\) is 16.0. This means that when you solve the equation \\(37k + 87 = 679\\), the value of \\(k\\) is 16.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<16>>>"
