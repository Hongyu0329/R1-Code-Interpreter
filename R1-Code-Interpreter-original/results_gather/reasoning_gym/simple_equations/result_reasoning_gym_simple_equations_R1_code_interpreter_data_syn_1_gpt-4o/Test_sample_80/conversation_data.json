    "To find the value of \\( p \\) in the equation \\( 54p + 34 = 3220 \\), we need to isolate \\( p \\) on one side of the equation. Here are the steps to solve for \\( p \\):\n\n1. Subtract 34 from both sides of the equation to get rid of the constant term on the left side.\n2. Divide the result by 54 to solve for \\( p \\).\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Given equation: 54*p + 34 = 3220\n\n# Step 1: Subtract 34 from both sides\nleft_side = 3220 - 34\n\n# Step 2: Divide by 54 to solve for p\np = left_side / 54\n\n# Output the value of p\nprint(p)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the value of \\( p \\).",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output indicates that the value of \\( p \\) is 59.0. This means that when you solve the equation \\( 54p + 34 = 3220 \\), the value of \\( p \\) is 59.\n\n<<<59>>>"
