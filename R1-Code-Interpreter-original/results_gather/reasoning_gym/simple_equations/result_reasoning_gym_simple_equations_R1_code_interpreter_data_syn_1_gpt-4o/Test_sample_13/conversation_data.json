    "To solve the equation \\(44i + 52 = 712\\), we need to isolate the variable \\(i\\). We can do this by following these steps:\n\n1. Subtract 52 from both sides of the equation to get rid of the constant term on the left side.\n2. Divide the resulting equation by 44 to solve for \\(i\\).\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Given equation: 44*i + 52 = 712\n\n# Step 1: Subtract 52 from both sides\nleft_side = 712 - 52\n\n# Step 2: Divide by 44 to solve for i\ni = left_side / 44\n\n# Output the result\nprint(i)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the value of \\(i\\).",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the value of \\(i\\) as 15.0. This means that the solution to the equation \\(44i + 52 = 712\\) is \\(i = 15\\).\n\n<<<15>>>"
