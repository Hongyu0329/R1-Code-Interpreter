    "To solve the equation \\(39 - 96g = -441\\), we need to isolate the variable \\(g\\). Here is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with the equation: \n   \\[\n   39 - 96g = -441\n   \\]\n\n2. Subtract 39 from both sides to move the constant term to the right side:\n   \\[\n   -96g = -441 - 39\n   \\]\n\n3. Simplify the right side:\n   \\[\n   -96g = -480\n   \\]\n\n4. Divide both sides by -96 to solve for \\(g\\):\n   \\[\n   g = \\frac{-480}{-96}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of \\(g\\) using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of g\ng = -480 / -96\nprint(g)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the value of \\(g\\).",
    "The calculation has been completed successfully, and the value of \\( g \\) is 5.0. Therefore, the solution to the equation \\( 39 - 96g = -441 \\) is:\n\n<<<5.0>>>"
