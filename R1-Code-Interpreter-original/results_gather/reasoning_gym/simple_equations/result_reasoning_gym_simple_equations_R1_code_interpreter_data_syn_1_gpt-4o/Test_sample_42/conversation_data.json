    "To solve the equation \\(28t - 41 = 967\\), we need to isolate the variable \\(t\\). Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Start with the equation: \\(28t - 41 = 967\\).\n2. Add 41 to both sides to eliminate the constant term on the left side:\n   \\[\n   28t = 967 + 41\n   \\]\n3. Simplify the right side:\n   \\[\n   28t = 1008\n   \\]\n4. Divide both sides by 28 to solve for \\(t\\):\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{1008}{28}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of \\(t\\) using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of t\nt = 1008 / 28\nprint(t)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the value of \\(t\\).",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the value of \\( t \\). Based on the calculation, the solution to the equation \\( 28t - 41 = 967 \\) is:\n\n<<<36>>>"
