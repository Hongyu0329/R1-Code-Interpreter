    "To solve the equation \\( 89w - 5 = 1419 \\), we need to isolate the variable \\( w \\).\n\n1. Start by adding 5 to both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant term on the left side:\n   \\[\n   89w - 5 + 5 = 1419 + 5\n   \\]\n   Simplifying gives:\n   \\[\n   89w = 1424\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, divide both sides by 89 to solve for \\( w \\):\n   \\[\n   w = \\frac{1424}{89}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of \\( w \\) using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of w\nw = 1424 / 89\nprint(w)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the value of \\( w \\).",
    "The code execution has provided the value of \\( w \\) as 16.0. This means that the solution to the equation \\( 89w - 5 = 1419 \\) is \\( w = 16 \\).\n\n<<<16>>>"
