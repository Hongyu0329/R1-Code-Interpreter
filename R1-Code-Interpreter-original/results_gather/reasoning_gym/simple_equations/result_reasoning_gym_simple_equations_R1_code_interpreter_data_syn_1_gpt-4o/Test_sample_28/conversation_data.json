    "To find the value of \\( j \\) in the equation \\( 62j + 14 = 386 \\), we need to isolate \\( j \\) on one side of the equation. Here are the steps to solve for \\( j \\):\n\n1. Subtract 14 from both sides of the equation to get rid of the constant term on the left side:\n   \\[\n   62j + 14 - 14 = 386 - 14\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this gives:\n   \\[\n   62j = 372\n   \\]\n\n2. Divide both sides of the equation by 62 to solve for \\( j \\):\n   \\[\n   j = \\frac{372}{62}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of \\( j \\) using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of j\nj = 372 / 62\nprint(j)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the value of \\( j \\).",
    "The code execution output indicates that the value of \\( j \\) is 6.0. This means that when you solve the equation \\( 62j + 14 = 386 \\), the value of \\( j \\) is 6. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<6>>>"
