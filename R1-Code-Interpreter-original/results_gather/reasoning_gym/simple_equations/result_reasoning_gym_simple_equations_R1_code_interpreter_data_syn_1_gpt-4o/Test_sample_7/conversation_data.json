    "To solve the equation \\(51g + 21 = 1704\\), we need to isolate the variable \\(g\\).\n\n1. Start by subtracting 21 from both sides of the equation to get:\n   \\[\n   51g = 1704 - 21\n   \\]\n\n2. Simplify the right side:\n   \\[\n   51g = 1683\n   \\]\n\n3. Divide both sides by 51 to solve for \\(g\\):\n   \\[\n   g = \\frac{1683}{51}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of \\(g\\) using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of g\ng = (1704 - 21) / 51\nprint(g)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the value of \\(g\\).",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the value of \\(g\\) as 33.0. Since \\(g\\) is an integer in this context, we can conclude that the value of \\(g\\) is 33.\n\n<<<33>>>"
