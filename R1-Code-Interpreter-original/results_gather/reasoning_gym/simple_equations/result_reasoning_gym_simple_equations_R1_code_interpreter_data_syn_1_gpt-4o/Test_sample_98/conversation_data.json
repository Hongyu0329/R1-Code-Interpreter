    "To solve the equation \\(120 - 83q = -6105\\), we need to isolate the variable \\(q\\). Here is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start by moving the constant term (120) to the right side of the equation by subtracting 120 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   -83q = -6105 - 120\n   \\]\n\n2. Simplify the right side:\n   \\[\n   -83q = -6225\n   \\]\n\n3. To solve for \\(q\\), divide both sides by -83:\n   \\[\n   q = \\frac{-6225}{-83}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of \\(q\\) using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of q\nq = -6225 / -83\nprint(q)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the value of \\(q\\).",
    "The code execution has provided the value of \\( q \\) as 75.0. This means that the solution to the equation \\( 120 - 83q = -6105 \\) is \\( q = 75 \\).\n\n<<<75>>>"
