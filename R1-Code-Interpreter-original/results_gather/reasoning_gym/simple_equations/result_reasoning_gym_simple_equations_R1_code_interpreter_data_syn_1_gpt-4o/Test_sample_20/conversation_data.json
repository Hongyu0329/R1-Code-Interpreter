    "To solve the equation \\(93 - 48i = -771\\), we need to isolate the variable \\(i\\). Here are the steps to solve for \\(i\\):\n\n1. Subtract 93 from both sides of the equation to get:\n   \\[\n   -48i = -771 - 93\n   \\]\n\n2. Simplify the right side:\n   \\[\n   -48i = -864\n   \\]\n\n3. Divide both sides by -48 to solve for \\(i\\):\n   \\[\n   i = \\frac{-864}{-48}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of \\(i\\) using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of i\ni = -864 / -48\nprint(i)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the value of \\(i\\).",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the value of \\(i\\) as 18.0. Therefore, the solution to the equation \\(93 - 48i = -771\\) is:\n\n<<<18>>>"
