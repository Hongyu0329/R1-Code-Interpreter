    "To find the value of \\( p \\) in the equation \\( 38p + 72 = 3454 \\), we need to isolate \\( p \\) on one side of the equation. Here are the steps to solve for \\( p \\):\n\n1. Subtract 72 from both sides of the equation to get rid of the constant term on the left side:\n   \\[\n   38p + 72 - 72 = 3454 - 72\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this gives:\n   \\[\n   38p = 3382\n   \\]\n\n2. Divide both sides of the equation by 38 to solve for \\( p \\):\n   \\[\n   p = \\frac{3382}{38}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of \\( p \\) using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of p\np = (3454 - 72) / 38\nprint(p)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the value of \\( p \\).",
    "The code execution has provided the value of \\( p \\) as 89.0. This means that the solution to the equation \\( 38p + 72 = 3454 \\) is \\( p = 89 \\).\n\n<<<89>>>"
