    "To solve the equation \\( 795 - 66c = -5673 \\), we need to isolate the variable \\( c \\).\n\n1. Start by moving the constant term on the left side to the right side of the equation:\n   \\[\n   795 - 66c = -5673 \\implies -66c = -5673 - 795\n   \\]\n\n2. Calculate the right side:\n   \\[\n   -5673 - 795 = -6468\n   \\]\n\n3. Now, the equation is:\n   \\[\n   -66c = -6468\n   \\]\n\n4. Divide both sides by -66 to solve for \\( c \\):\n   \\[\n   c = \\frac{-6468}{-66}\n   \\]\n\nLet's compute this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of c\nc = -6468 / -66\nprint(c)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, we will have the value of \\( c \\).",
    "The calculation shows that the value of \\( c \\) is 98.0. Therefore, the value of \\( c \\) that satisfies the equation \\( 795 - 66c = -5673 \\) is:\n\n<<<98>>>"
