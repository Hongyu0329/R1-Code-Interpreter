  "response_list": [
    "To find the value of \\( h \\) in the equation \\( 1062 \\times h = 97704 \\), we need to isolate \\( h \\). This can be done by dividing both sides of the equation by 1062.\n\nThe equation becomes:\n\n\\[ h = \\frac{97704}{1062} \\]\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of h\nh = 97704 / 1062\nprint(h)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the value of \\( h \\).",
    "The calculation has been successfully executed, and the value of \\( h \\) is 92.0. \n\nTherefore, the solution to the equation \\( 1062 \\times h = 97704 \\) is:\n\n<<<92>>>"
