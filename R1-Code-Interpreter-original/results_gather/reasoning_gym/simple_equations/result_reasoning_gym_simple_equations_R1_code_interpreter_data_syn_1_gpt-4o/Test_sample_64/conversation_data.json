    "To solve the equation \\(44l - 78 = 54\\), we need to isolate the variable \\(l\\). Here are the steps to solve for \\(l\\):\n\n1. Add 78 to both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant term on the left side:\n   \\[\n   44l - 78 + 78 = 54 + 78\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this gives:\n   \\[\n   44l = 132\n   \\]\n\n2. Divide both sides by 44 to solve for \\(l\\):\n   \\[\n   l = \\frac{132}{44}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's compute the value of \\(l\\) using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of l\nl = 132 / 44\nprint(l)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the value of \\(l\\).",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the value of \\( l \\) as 3.0. Therefore, the solution to the equation \\( 44l - 78 = 54 \\) is:\n\n<<<3>>>"
