    "To solve for \\( g \\) in the equation \\( 72g + 67 = 6979 \\), we need to isolate \\( g \\). Here are the steps:\n\n1. Subtract 67 from both sides of the equation to get:\n   \\[\n   72g = 6979 - 67\n   \\]\n\n2. Simplify the right side:\n   \\[\n   72g = 6912\n   \\]\n\n3. Divide both sides by 72 to solve for \\( g \\):\n   \\[\n   g = \\frac{6912}{72}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of \\( g \\) using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of g\ng = (6979 - 67) / 72\nprint(g)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the value of \\( g \\).",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the value of \\( g \\) as 96.0. Therefore, the solution to the equation \\( 72g + 67 = 6979 \\) is:\n\n<<<96>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Solve for g: 72*g + 67 = 6979\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",
