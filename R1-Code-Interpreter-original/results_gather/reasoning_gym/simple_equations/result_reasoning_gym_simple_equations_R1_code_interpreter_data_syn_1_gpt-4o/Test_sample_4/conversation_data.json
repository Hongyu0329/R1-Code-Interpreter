    "To find the value of \\( k \\) in the equation \\( k - 37 = -14 \\), we need to isolate \\( k \\) on one side of the equation. We can do this by adding 37 to both sides of the equation. This will cancel out the -37 on the left side and give us the value of \\( k \\).\n\nLet's perform the calculation:\n\n1. Start with the equation: \\( k - 37 = -14 \\).\n2. Add 37 to both sides: \\( k - 37 + 37 = -14 + 37 \\).\n3. Simplify both sides: \\( k = 23 \\).\n\nNow, let's verify this calculation using a simple Python script to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the equation\nk_minus_37 = -14\n\n# Add 37 to both sides to solve for k\nk = k_minus_37 + 37\n\n# Print the result\nprint(k)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the value of \\( k \\).",
    "The code execution confirms that the value of \\( k \\) is indeed 23. Therefore, the solution to the equation \\( k - 37 = -14 \\) is:\n\n<<<23>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Find the value of k in the equation: k - 37 = -14\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",
