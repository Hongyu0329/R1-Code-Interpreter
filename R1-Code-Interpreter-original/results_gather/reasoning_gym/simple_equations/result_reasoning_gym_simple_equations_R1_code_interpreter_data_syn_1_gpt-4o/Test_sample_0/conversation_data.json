    "To find the value of \\( c \\) in the equation \\( 64c + 39 = 359 \\), we need to isolate \\( c \\) on one side of the equation. We can do this by following these steps:\n\n1. Subtract 39 from both sides of the equation to get rid of the constant term on the left side.\n2. Divide the result by 64 to solve for \\( c \\).\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Given equation: 64*c + 39 = 359\n\n# Step 1: Subtract 39 from both sides\nleft_side = 359 - 39\n\n# Step 2: Divide by 64 to solve for c\nc = left_side / 64\n\n# Output the value of c\nprint(c)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the value of \\( c \\).",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the value of \\( c \\) as 5.0. This means that the solution to the equation \\( 64c + 39 = 359 \\) is \\( c = 5 \\).\n\n<<<5>>>"
