    "To solve the equation \\(119p + 49 = 2786\\), we need to isolate the variable \\(p\\). Here are the steps to solve for \\(p\\):\n\n1. Subtract 49 from both sides of the equation to get rid of the constant term on the left side.\n2. Divide both sides by 119 to solve for \\(p\\).\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the constants\na = 119\nb = 49\nc = 2786\n\n# Calculate p\np = (c - b) / a\n\n# Print the result\nprint(p)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the value of \\(p\\).",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the value of \\(p\\) as 23.0. This means that the solution to the equation \\(119p + 49 = 2786\\) is \\(p = 23\\).\n\n<<<23>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Solve for p: 119*p + 49 = 2786\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",
