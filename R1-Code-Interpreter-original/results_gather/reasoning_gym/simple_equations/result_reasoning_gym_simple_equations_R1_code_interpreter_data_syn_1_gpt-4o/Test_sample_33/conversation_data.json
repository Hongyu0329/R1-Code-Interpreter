    "To solve the equation \\(8 - 59n = -2588\\), we need to isolate \\(n\\). Here are the steps to solve for \\(n\\):\n\n1. Subtract 8 from both sides of the equation to get rid of the constant term on the left side:\n   \\[\n   -59n = -2588 - 8\n   \\]\n\n2. Simplify the right side:\n   \\[\n   -59n = -2596\n   \\]\n\n3. Divide both sides by -59 to solve for \\(n\\):\n   \\[\n   n = \\frac{-2596}{-59}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of \\(n\\) using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of n\nn = -2596 / -59\nprint(n)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the value of \\(n\\).",
    "The code execution output indicates that the value of \\(n\\) is 44.0. Since \\(n\\) is typically an integer in such equations, we can conclude that \\(n = 44\\).\n\n<<<44>>>"
