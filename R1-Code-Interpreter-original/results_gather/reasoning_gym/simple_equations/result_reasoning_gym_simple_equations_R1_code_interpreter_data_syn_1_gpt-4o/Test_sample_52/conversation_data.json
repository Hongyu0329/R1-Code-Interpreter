    "To solve the equation \\(335x + 63 = 8773\\), we need to isolate \\(x\\). We can do this by following these steps:\n\n1. Subtract 63 from both sides of the equation to get rid of the constant term on the left side.\n2. Divide the result by 335 to solve for \\(x\\).\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Given equation: 335*x + 63 = 8773\n\n# Step 1: Subtract 63 from both sides\nresult_after_subtraction = 8773 - 63\n\n# Step 2: Divide the result by 335 to solve for x\nx = result_after_subtraction / 335\n\n# Output the value of x\nprint(x)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the value of \\(x\\).",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output indicates that the value of \\(x\\) is 26.0. This means that when you substitute \\(x = 26\\) back into the original equation, it satisfies the equation \\(335x + 63 = 8773\\).\n\nTherefore, the solution to the equation is:\n\n<<<26>>>"
