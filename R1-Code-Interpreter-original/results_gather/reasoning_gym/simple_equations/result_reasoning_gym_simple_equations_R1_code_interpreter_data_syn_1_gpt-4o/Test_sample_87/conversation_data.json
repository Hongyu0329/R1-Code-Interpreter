    "To solve the equation \\(14j + 95 = 865\\), we need to isolate the variable \\(j\\). Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Subtract 95 from both sides of the equation to get rid of the constant term on the left side:\n   \\[\n   14j + 95 - 95 = 865 - 95\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this gives:\n   \\[\n   14j = 770\n   \\]\n\n2. Divide both sides by 14 to solve for \\(j\\):\n   \\[\n   j = \\frac{770}{14}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of \\(j\\) using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of j\nj = (865 - 95) / 14\nprint(j)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the value of \\(j\\).",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the value of \\( j \\). The calculation shows that \\( j = 55.0 \\). Since \\( j \\) is an integer in the context of this equation, we can conclude that \\( j = 55 \\).\n\n<<<55>>>"
