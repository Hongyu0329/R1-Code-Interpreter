    "To solve the equation \\(19p + 151 = 246\\), we need to isolate the variable \\(p\\).\n\n1. Start by subtracting 151 from both sides of the equation to get:\n   \\[\n   19p = 246 - 151\n   \\]\n\n2. Simplify the right side:\n   \\[\n   19p = 95\n   \\]\n\n3. Divide both sides by 19 to solve for \\(p\\):\n   \\[\n   p = \\frac{95}{19}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of \\(p\\) using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of p\np = (246 - 151) / 19\nprint(p)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the value of \\(p\\).",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the value of \\( p \\) as 5.0. This means that the value of \\( p \\) that satisfies the equation \\( 19p + 151 = 246 \\) is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
