    "To solve the equation \\(70 - 7s = -126\\), we need to isolate the variable \\(s\\). Let's go through the steps:\n\n1. Start with the equation: \\(70 - 7s = -126\\).\n2. Subtract 70 from both sides to get: \\(-7s = -126 - 70\\).\n3. Simplify the right side: \\(-7s = -196\\).\n4. Divide both sides by -7 to solve for \\(s\\): \\(s = \\frac{-196}{-7}\\).\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of \\(s\\) using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of s\ns = -196 / -7\nprint(s)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the value of \\(s\\).",
