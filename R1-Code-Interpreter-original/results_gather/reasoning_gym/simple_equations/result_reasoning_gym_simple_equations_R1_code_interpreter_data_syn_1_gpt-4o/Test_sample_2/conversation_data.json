    "To solve the equation \\(1500q + 120 = 82620\\), we need to isolate the variable \\(q\\). Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Subtract 120 from both sides**: This will help in getting rid of the constant term on the left side of the equation.\n   \\[\n   1500q + 120 - 120 = 82620 - 120\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this gives:\n   \\[\n   1500q = 82500\n   \\]\n\n2. **Divide both sides by 1500**: This will isolate \\(q\\) on the left side.\n   \\[\n   q = \\frac{82500}{1500}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of \\(q\\) using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of q\nq = (82620 - 120) / 1500\nprint(q)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the value of \\(q\\).",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the value of \\( q \\) as 55.0. This means that when you solve the equation \\( 1500q + 120 = 82620 \\), the value of \\( q \\) is 55.\n\n<<<55>>>"
