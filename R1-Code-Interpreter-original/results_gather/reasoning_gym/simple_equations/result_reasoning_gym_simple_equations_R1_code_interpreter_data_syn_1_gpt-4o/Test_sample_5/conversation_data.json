    "To solve the equation \\(6480v - 182 = 570058\\), we need to isolate the variable \\(v\\). Here is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Add 182 to both sides**: This will help eliminate the constant term on the left side of the equation.\n   \\[\n   6480v = 570058 + 182\n   \\]\n\n2. **Simplify the right side**: Calculate the sum of 570058 and 182.\n   \\[\n   6480v = 570240\n   \\]\n\n3. **Divide both sides by 6480**: This will solve for \\(v\\).\n   \\[\n   v = \\frac{570240}{6480}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's compute the value of \\(v\\) using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of v\nv = (570058 + 182) / 6480\nprint(v)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the value of \\(v\\).",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the value of \\(v\\) as 88.0. This means that when you solve the equation \\(6480v - 182 = 570058\\), the value of \\(v\\) is 88.\n\n<<<88>>>"
