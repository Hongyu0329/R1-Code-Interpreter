    "\nassistant > To find the value of \\( s \\) that satisfies the equation \\( 70 - 7s = -126 \\), we can solve for \\( s \\) as follows:\n\n1. Subtract 70 from both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   -7s = -126 - 70\n   \\]\n\n2. Simplify the right side:\n   \\[\n   -7s = -196\n   \\]\n\n3. Divide both sides by -7 to solve for \\( s \\):\n   \\[\n   s = \\frac{-196}{-7}\n   \\]\n\nLet's calculate the value of \\( s \\).\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Calculate the value of s\ns = -196 / -7\ns\nassistant > The value of \\( s \\) that satisfies the equation is <<<28>>>."
