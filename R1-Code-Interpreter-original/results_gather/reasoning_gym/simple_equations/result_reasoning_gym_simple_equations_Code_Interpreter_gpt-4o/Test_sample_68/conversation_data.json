    "\nassistant > To find the value of \\( e \\) that satisfies the equation \\(-51e - 40 = -805\\), we can solve for \\( e \\) as follows:\n\n1. Add 40 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \\( e \\) on one side:\n   \\[\n   -51e = -805 + 40\n   \\]\n\n2. Simplify the right side:\n   \\[\n   -51e = -765\n   \\]\n\n3.
