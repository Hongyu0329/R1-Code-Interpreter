    "\nassistant > To find the value of \\( o \\) that satisfies the equation \\( 63 - 17o = -5 \\), we can solve for \\( o \\) as follows:\n\n1. Subtract 63 from both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   -17o = -5 - 63\n   \\]\n\n2. Simplify the right side:\n   \\[\n   -17o = -68\n   \\]\n\n3. Divide both sides by -17 to solve for \\( o \\):\n   \\[\n   o = \\frac{-68}{-17}\n   \\]\n\nLet's calculate the value of \\( o \\).\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Calculate the value of o\no = -68 / -17\no\nassistant > The value of \\( o \\) that satisfies the equation is <<<4.0>>>."
