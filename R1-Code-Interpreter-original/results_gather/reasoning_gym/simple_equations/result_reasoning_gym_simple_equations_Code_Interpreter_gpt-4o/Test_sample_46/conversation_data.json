    "\nassistant > To find the value of \\( g \\) that satisfies the equation \\( 39 - 96g = -441 \\), we can solve for \\( g \\) as follows:\n\n1. Subtract 39 from both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   -96g = -441 - 39\n   \\]\n\n2. Simplify the right side:\n   \\[\n   -96g = -480\n   \\]\n\n3. Divide both sides by -96 to solve for \\( g \\):\n   \\[\n   g = \\frac{-480}{-96}\n   \\]\n\nLet's calculate the value of \\( g \\).\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Calculate the value of g\ng = -480 / -96\ng\nassistant > The value of \\( g \\) that satisfies the equation is <<<5.0>>>."
