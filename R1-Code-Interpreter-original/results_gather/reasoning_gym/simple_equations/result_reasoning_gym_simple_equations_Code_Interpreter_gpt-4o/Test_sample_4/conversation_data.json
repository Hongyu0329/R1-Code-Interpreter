    "\nassistant > To find the value of \\( k \\) in the equation \\( k - 37 = -14 \\), we need to isolate \\( k \\) on one side of the equation. We can do this by adding 37 to both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[\nk - 37 + 37 = -14 + 37\n\\]\n\nSimplifying both sides, we get:\n\n\\[\nk = 23\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of \\( k \\) is 23. \n\nThe final answer is <<<23>>>."
