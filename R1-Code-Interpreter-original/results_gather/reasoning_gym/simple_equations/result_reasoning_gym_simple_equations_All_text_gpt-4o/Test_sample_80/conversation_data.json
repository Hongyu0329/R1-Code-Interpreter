    "To find the value of \\( p \\) in the equation \\( 54p + 34 = 3220 \\), we will solve the equation step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation given is \\( 54p + 34 = 3220 \\). Our goal is to isolate \\( p \\) on one side of the equation.\n\n2. **Subtract 34 from Both Sides**: \n   - We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation. \n   - Subtract 34 from both sides:\n     \\[\n     54p + 34 - 34 = 3220 - 34\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying both sides gives:\n     \\[\n     54p = 3186\n     \\]\n\n3. **Divide Both Sides by 54**:\n   - To solve for \\( p \\), divide both sides of the equation by 54:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{54p}{54} = \\frac{3186}{54}\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying the left side gives:\n     \\[\n     p = \\frac{3186}{54}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Division**:\n   - Perform the division to find the value of \\( p \\):\n     \\[\n     p = 59\n     \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - Substitute \\( p = 59 \\) back into the original equation to verify:\n     \\[\n     54 \\times 59 + 34 = 3220\n     \\]\n   - Calculate \\( 54 \\times 59 \\):\n     \\[\n     54 \\times 59 = 3186\n     \\]\n   - Add 34 to 3186:\n     \\[\n     3186 + 34 = 3220\n     \\]\n   - Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution is verified.\n\nThe value of \\( p \\) is correct.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<59>>>."
