    "To solve the equation \\(43j - 15 = 3038\\) for \\(j\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation is a linear equation in one variable, \\(j\\). Our goal is to isolate \\(j\\) on one side of the equation.\n\n2. **Add 15 to Both Sides**: To eliminate the constant term on the left side, add 15 to both sides of the equation.\n   \\[\n   43j - 15 + 15 = 3038 + 15\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   43j = 3053\n   \\]\n\n3. **Divide Both Sides by 43**: To solve for \\(j\\), divide both sides of the equation by 43.\n   \\[\n   j = \\frac{3053}{43}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Division**: Perform the division to find the value of \\(j\\).\n   \\[\n   j = 71\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**: Substitute \\(j = 71\\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.\n   \\[\n   43 \\times 71 - 15 = 3038\n   \\]\n   Calculate \\(43 \\times 71\\):\n   \\[\n   43 \\times 71 = 3053\n   \\]\n   Then subtract 15:\n   \\[\n   3053 - 15 = 3038\n   \\]\n   The left side equals the right side, confirming that \\(j = 71\\) is correct.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<71>>>"
