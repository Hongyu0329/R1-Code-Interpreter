    "To solve the equation \\(28t - 41 = 967\\) for \\(t\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation is a linear equation in one variable, \\(t\\). Our goal is to isolate \\(t\\) on one side of the equation.\n\n2. **Add 41 to Both Sides**: To eliminate the \\(-41\\) on the left side, add 41 to both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   28t - 41 + 41 = 967 + 41\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   28t = 1008\n   \\]\n\n3. **Divide Both Sides by 28**: To solve for \\(t\\), divide both sides of the equation by 28:\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{1008}{28}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Division**: Perform the division to find the value of \\(t\\):\n   \\[\n   t = 36\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**: Substitute \\(t = 36\\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:\n   \\[\n   28 \\times 36 - 41 = 967\n   \\]\n   Calculate \\(28 \\times 36\\):\n   \\[\n   28 \\times 36 = 1008\n   \\]\n   Then subtract 41:\n   \\[\n   1008 - 41 = 967\n   \\]\n   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution is verified.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<36>>>"
