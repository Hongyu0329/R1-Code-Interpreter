    "To determine the value of \\( c \\) that satisfies the equation \\( 795 - 66c = -5673 \\), we will solve the equation step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation:**\n   - We have the equation \\( 795 - 66c = -5673 \\).\n   - Our goal is to isolate \\( c \\) on one side of the equation to find its value.\n\n2. **Isolate the Term with \\( c \\):**\n   - To isolate the term with \\( c \\), we need to eliminate the constant term on the left side of the equation.\n   - Subtract 795 from both sides of the equation:\n     \\[\n     795 - 66c - 795 = -5673 - 795\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying both sides gives:\n     \\[\n     -66c = -6468\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( c \\):**\n   - Now, we need to solve for \\( c \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by -66:\n     \\[\n     c = \\frac{-6468}{-66}\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying the division:\n     \\[\n     c = 98\n     \\]\n\n4. **Verify the Solution:**\n   - Substitute \\( c = 98 \\) back into the original equation to verify:\n     \\[\n     795 - 66 \\times 98 = 795 - 6468 = -5673\n     \\]\n   - The left side equals the right side, confirming that \\( c = 98 \\) is correct.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe value of \\( c \\) that satisfies the equation is \\( 98 \\).\n\n<<<98>>>"
