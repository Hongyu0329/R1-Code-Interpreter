    "To determine the value of \\( j \\) that satisfies the equation \\( 14j + 95 = 865 \\), we will solve the equation step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: \n   - The equation given is \\( 14j + 95 = 865 \\).\n   - We need to isolate \\( j \\) on one side of the equation to find its value.\n\n2. **Subtract 95 from Both Sides**:\n   - To isolate the term with \\( j \\), subtract 95 from both sides of the equation.\n   - This gives: \n     \\[\n     14j + 95 - 95 = 865 - 95\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying both sides, we get:\n     \\[\n     14j = 770\n     \\]\n\n3. **Divide Both Sides by 14**:\n   - Now, divide both sides of the equation by 14 to solve for \\( j \\).\n   - This gives:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{14j}{14} = \\frac{770}{14}\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying, we find:\n     \\[\n     j = 55\n     \\]\n\n4. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - Substitute \\( j = 55 \\) back into the original equation to verify:\n     \\[\n     14 \\times 55 + 95 = 865\n     \\]\n   - Calculate \\( 14 \\times 55 \\):\n     \\[\n     14 \\times 55 = 770\n     \\]\n   - Add 95 to 770:\n     \\[\n     770 + 95 = 865\n     \\]\n   - Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution \\( j = 55 \\) is verified.\n\nTherefore, the value of \\( j \\) that satisfies the equation is \\( 55 \\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<55>>>."
