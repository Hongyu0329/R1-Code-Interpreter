    "To determine the value of \\( c \\) that satisfies the equation \\( 680c + 63 = 60583 \\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation given is a linear equation in the form \\( ax + b = c \\), where \\( a = 680 \\), \\( b = 63 \\), and \\( c = 60583 \\). We need to solve for \\( x \\), which is represented by \\( c \\) in this context.\n\n2. **Isolate the Variable**: To solve for \\( c \\), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by subtracting 63 from both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant term on the left side.\n\n   \\[\n   680c + 63 - 63 = 60583 - 63\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying both sides, we get:\n\n   \\[\n   680c = 60520\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( c \\)**: Now, we need to solve for \\( c \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 680.\n\n   \\[\n   c = \\frac{60520}{680}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Perform the Division**: Calculate the division to find the value of \\( c \\).\n\n   \\[\n   c = 89\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**: To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \\( c = 89 \\) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.\n\n   \\[\n   680 \\times 89 + 63 = 60583\n   \\]\n\n   Calculate the left side:\n\n   \\[\n   680 \\times 89 = 60520\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   60520 + 63 = 60583\n   \\]\n\n   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution is verified.\n\nThe value of \\( c \\) that satisfies the equation is:\n\n<<<89>>>"
