    "To solve the equation \\(93 - 48i = -771\\) for \\(i\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Isolate the term with \\(i\\):**  \n   Start by moving the constant term on the left side of the equation to the right side. This can be done by subtracting 93 from both sides of the equation.\n\n   \\[\n   93 - 48i - 93 = -771 - 93\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n\n   \\[\n   -48i = -864\n   \\]\n\n2. **Solve for \\(i\\):**  \n   To solve for \\(i\\), divide both sides of the equation by \\(-48\\).\n\n   \\[\n   i = \\frac{-864}{-48}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the division:**  \n   Calculate the division:\n\n   \\[\n   i = 18\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of \\(i\\) is 18.\n\nFinal answer: <<<18>>>"
