    "To determine the value of \\( x \\) that satisfies the equation \\( 78x - 161 = 2491 \\), we will solve the equation step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The given equation is a linear equation in the form \\( ax + b = c \\), where \\( a = 78 \\), \\( b = -161 \\), and \\( c = 2491 \\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Term with \\( x \\)**: To isolate the term with \\( x \\), we need to eliminate the constant term on the left side of the equation. We do this by adding 161 to both sides of the equation:\n\n   \\[\n   78x - 161 + 161 = 2491 + 161\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n\n   \\[\n   78x = 2652\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( x \\)**: Now that we have isolated the term with \\( x \\), we need to solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 78:\n\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{2652}{78}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Perform the Division**: Calculate the division to find the value of \\( x \\):\n\n   \\[\n   x = 34\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**: To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \\( x = 34 \\) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal:\n\n   \\[\n   78 \\times 34 - 161 = 2491\n   \\]\n\n   Calculate the left side:\n\n   \\[\n   78 \\times 34 = 2652\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   2652 - 161 = 2491\n   \\]\n\n   Since both sides are equal, the solution is verified.\n\nThe value of \\( x \\) that satisfies the equation is \\( 34 \\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<34>>>"
