    "To determine the value of \\( n \\) that satisfies the equation \\( 8 - 59n = -2588 \\), we will solve the equation step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Equation\nThe given equation is:\n\\[ 8 - 59n = -2588 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Isolate the Term with \\( n \\)\nTo isolate the term with \\( n \\), we need to eliminate the constant term on the left side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 8 from both sides:\n\\[ 8 - 59n - 8 = -2588 - 8 \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ -59n = -2596 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Solve for \\( n \\)\nNow, we need to solve for \\( n \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by -59:\n\\[ n = \\frac{-2596}{-59} \\]\n\n### Step 4: Simplify the Division\nPerform the division:\n\\[ n = \\frac{2596}{59} \\]\n\nTo simplify, we perform the division:\n- 2596 divided by 59 equals 44.\n\nThus, the value of \\( n \\) is 44.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe value of \\( n \\) that satisfies the equation is 44.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<44>>>"
