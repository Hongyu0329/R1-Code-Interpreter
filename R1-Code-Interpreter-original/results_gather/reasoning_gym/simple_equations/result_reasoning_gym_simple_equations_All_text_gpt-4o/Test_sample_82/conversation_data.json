    "To find the value of \\( h \\) in the equation \\( 20h - 162 = 1338 \\), we will solve the equation step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the equation**: The equation given is \\( 20h - 162 = 1338 \\). Our goal is to isolate \\( h \\) on one side of the equation.\n\n2. **Add 162 to both sides**: To eliminate the \\(-162\\) on the left side, add 162 to both sides of the equation.\n   \\[\n   20h - 162 + 162 = 1338 + 162\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   20h = 1500\n   \\]\n\n3. **Divide both sides by 20**: To solve for \\( h \\), divide both sides of the equation by 20.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{20h}{20} = \\frac{1500}{20}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying gives:\n   \\[\n   h = 75\n   \\]\n\n4. **Verify the solution**: Substitute \\( h = 75 \\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.\n   \\[\n   20(75) - 162 = 1338\n   \\]\n   Calculate:\n   \\[\n   1500 - 162 = 1338\n   \\]\n   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution is verified.\n\nThe value of \\( h \\) is \\( 75 \\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<75>>>"
