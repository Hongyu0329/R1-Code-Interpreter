    "To determine the value of \\( z \\) that satisfies the equation \\( 99z + 41 = 6476 \\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation given is a linear equation in the form of \\( 99z + 41 = 6476 \\). Our goal is to solve for \\( z \\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Term with \\( z \\)**: To isolate the term with \\( z \\), we need to eliminate the constant term on the left side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 41 from both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   99z + 41 - 41 = 6476 - 41\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   99z = 6435\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( z \\)**: Now that we have isolated the term with \\( z \\), we need to solve for \\( z \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 99:\n   \\[\n   z = \\frac{6435}{99}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Perform the Division**: To find the value of \\( z \\), perform the division:\n   \\[\n   z = 65\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**: To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \\( z = 65 \\) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal:\n   \\[\n   99 \\times 65 + 41 = 6476\n   \\]\n   Calculate \\( 99 \\times 65 \\):\n   \\[\n   99 \\times 65 = 6435\n   \\]\n   Add 41 to 6435:\n   \\[\n   6435 + 41 = 6476\n   \\]\n   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution \\( z = 65 \\) is verified.\n\nThe value of \\( z \\) that satisfies the equation is \\( 65 \\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<65>>>."
