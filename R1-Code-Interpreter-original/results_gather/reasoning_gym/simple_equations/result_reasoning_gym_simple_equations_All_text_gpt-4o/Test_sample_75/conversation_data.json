    "To find the value of \\( h \\) in the equation \\(-62h - 2256 = -6596\\), we will solve the equation step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The given equation is \\(-62h - 2256 = -6596\\). Our goal is to isolate \\( h \\) on one side of the equation.\n\n2. **Isolate the Term with \\( h \\)**: \n   - Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation. We do this by adding 2256 to both sides of the equation:\n     \\[\n     -62h - 2256 + 2256 = -6596 + 2256\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying both sides gives:\n     \\[\n     -62h = -4340\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( h \\)**:\n   - Now, we need to isolate \\( h \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by \\(-62\\):\n     \\[\n     h = \\frac{-4340}{-62}\n     \\]\n   - Simplify the division:\n     \\[\n     h = 70\n     \\]\n\n4. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - Substitute \\( h = 70 \\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:\n     \\[\n     -62(70) - 2256 = -6596\n     \\]\n   - Calculate \\(-62 \\times 70\\):\n     \\[\n     -4340\n     \\]\n   - Substitute back:\n     \\[\n     -4340 - 2256 = -6596\n     \\]\n   - Simplify the left side:\n     \\[\n     -6596 = -6596\n     \\]\n   - The left side equals the right side, confirming that \\( h = 70 \\) is correct.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<70>>>"
