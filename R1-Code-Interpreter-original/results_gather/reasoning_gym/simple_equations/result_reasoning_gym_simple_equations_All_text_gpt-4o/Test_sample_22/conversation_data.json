    "To solve the equation \\(49e + 134 = 4740\\) for \\(e\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation is a linear equation in the form of \\(ax + b = c\\), where \\(a = 49\\), \\(b = 134\\), and \\(c = 4740\\). We need to solve for \\(e\\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Term with \\(e\\)**: \n   - Subtract 134 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \\(e\\).\n   \\[\n   49e + 134 - 134 = 4740 - 134\n   \\]\n   - Simplifying both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   49e = 4606\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(e\\)**:\n   - Divide both sides of the equation by 49 to solve for \\(e\\).\n   \\[\n   e = \\frac{4606}{49}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Division**:\n   - Perform the division to find the value of \\(e\\).\n   \\[\n   e = 94\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - Substitute \\(e = 94\\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.\n   \\[\n   49 \\times 94 + 134 = 4740\n   \\]\n   - Calculate \\(49 \\times 94\\):\n   \\[\n   49 \\times 94 = 4606\n   \\]\n   - Add 134 to 4606:\n   \\[\n   4606 + 134 = 4740\n   \\]\n   - Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution is verified.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<94>>>"
