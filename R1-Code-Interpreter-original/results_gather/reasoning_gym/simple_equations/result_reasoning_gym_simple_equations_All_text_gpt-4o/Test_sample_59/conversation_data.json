    "To find the value of \\( c \\) in the equation \\( 1937 - 59c = -10 \\), we will solve the equation step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The given equation is \\( 1937 - 59c = -10 \\). We need to isolate \\( c \\) on one side of the equation to find its value.\n\n2. **Move Constant Term**: Start by moving the constant term on the left side of the equation to the right side. This is done by subtracting 1937 from both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   1937 - 59c - 1937 = -10 - 1937\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   -59c = -1947\n   \\]\n\n3. **Isolate \\( c \\)**: To isolate \\( c \\), divide both sides of the equation by -59:\n   \\[\n   c = \\frac{-1947}{-59}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the Division**: Calculate the division:\n   \\[\n   c = 33\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**: Substitute \\( c = 33 \\) back into the original equation to verify:\n   \\[\n   1937 - 59 \\times 33 = 1937 - 1947 = -10\n   \\]\n   The left side equals the right side, confirming that the solution is correct.\n\nThe value of \\( c \\) is 33.\n\nFinal answer: <<<33>>>"
