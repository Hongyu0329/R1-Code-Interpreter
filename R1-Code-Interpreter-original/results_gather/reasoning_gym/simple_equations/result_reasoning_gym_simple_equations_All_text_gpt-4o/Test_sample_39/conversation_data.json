    "To find the value of \\( k \\) in the equation \\( 34k + 26 = 2236 \\), we will solve the equation step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation given is \\( 34k + 26 = 2236 \\). We need to isolate \\( k \\) on one side of the equation to find its value.\n\n2. **Subtract 26 from Both Sides**: \n   - Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation. \n   - Subtract 26 from both sides:\n     \\[\n     34k + 26 - 26 = 2236 - 26\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying both sides gives:\n     \\[\n     34k = 2210\n     \\]\n\n3. **Divide Both Sides by 34**:\n   - To solve for \\( k \\), divide both sides of the equation by 34:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{34k}{34} = \\frac{2210}{34}\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying the left side gives:\n     \\[\n     k = \\frac{2210}{34}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Division**:\n   - Perform the division \\( 2210 \\div 34 \\):\n     - 34 goes into 2210 approximately 65 times (since \\( 34 \\times 65 = 2210 \\)).\n   - Therefore, \\( k = 65 \\).\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - Substitute \\( k = 65 \\) back into the original equation to verify:\n     \\[\n     34 \\times 65 + 26 = 2236\n     \\]\n   - Calculate \\( 34 \\times 65 = 2210 \\).\n   - Add 26 to 2210 to get 2236, which matches the right side of the original equation.\n\nThe solution is verified, and the value of \\( k \\) is correct.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<65>>>."
