    "To determine the value of \\( c \\) that satisfies the equation \\( 1848c - 58 = 23966 \\), we will solve the equation step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: \n   - The equation given is \\( 1848c - 58 = 23966 \\).\n   - Our goal is to solve for \\( c \\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Term with \\( c \\)**:\n   - To isolate the term with \\( c \\), we need to eliminate the constant term on the left side of the equation.\n   - Add 58 to both sides of the equation to move the constant term to the right side:\n     \\[\n     1848c - 58 + 58 = 23966 + 58\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying both sides gives:\n     \\[\n     1848c = 24024\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( c \\)**:\n   - Now, we need to solve for \\( c \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 1848:\n     \\[\n     c = \\frac{24024}{1848}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Perform the Division**:\n   - Calculate the division:\n     \\[\n     c = 13\n     \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - Substitute \\( c = 13 \\) back into the original equation to verify:\n     \\[\n     1848 \\times 13 - 58 = 23966\n     \\]\n   - Calculate \\( 1848 \\times 13 \\):\n     \\[\n     1848 \\times 13 = 24024\n     \\]\n   - Subtract 58 from 24024:\n     \\[\n     24024 - 58 = 23966\n     \\]\n   - The left side equals the right side, confirming that \\( c = 13 \\) is correct.\n\nThe value of \\( c \\) that satisfies the equation is \\( 13 \\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<13>>>"
