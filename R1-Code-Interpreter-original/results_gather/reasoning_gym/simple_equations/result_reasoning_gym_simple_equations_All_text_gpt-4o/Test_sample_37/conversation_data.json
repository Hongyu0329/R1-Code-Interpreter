    "To solve the equation \\(78v + 22 = 5560\\) for \\(v\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation is a linear equation in the form of \\(ax + b = c\\), where \\(a = 78\\), \\(b = 22\\), and \\(c = 5560\\). We need to solve for \\(v\\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Term with \\(v\\)**: \n   - Subtract 22 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \\(v\\).\n   - This gives us: \n     \\[\n     78v + 22 - 22 = 5560 - 22\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying both sides, we get:\n     \\[\n     78v = 5538\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(v\\)**:\n   - Divide both sides of the equation by 78 to solve for \\(v\\).\n   - This gives us:\n     \\[\n     v = \\frac{5538}{78}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Perform the Division**:\n   - Calculate \\(\\frac{5538}{78}\\).\n   - Performing the division, we find:\n     \\[\n     v = 71\n     \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - Substitute \\(v = 71\\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.\n   - Calculate \\(78 \\times 71 + 22\\):\n     \\[\n     78 \\times 71 = 5538\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     5538 + 22 = 5560\n     \\]\n   - The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming that \\(v = 71\\) is correct.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<71>>>."
