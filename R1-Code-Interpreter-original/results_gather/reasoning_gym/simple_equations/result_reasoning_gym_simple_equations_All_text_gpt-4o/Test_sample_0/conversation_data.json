    "To find the value of \\( c \\) in the equation \\( 64c + 39 = 359 \\), we will solve the equation step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation given is \\( 64c + 39 = 359 \\). We need to isolate \\( c \\) on one side of the equation to find its value.\n\n2. **Subtract 39 from Both Sides**: To begin isolating \\( c \\), subtract 39 from both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant term on the left side.\n   \\[\n   64c + 39 - 39 = 359 - 39\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   64c = 320\n   \\]\n\n3. **Divide Both Sides by 64**: Now, divide both sides of the equation by 64 to solve for \\( c \\).\n   \\[\n   \\frac{64c}{64} = \\frac{320}{64}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the right side gives:\n   \\[\n   c = 5\n   \\]\n\n4. **Verify the Solution**: To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \\( c = 5 \\) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.\n   \\[\n   64 \\times 5 + 39 = 320 + 39 = 359\n   \\]\n   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution is verified.\n\nThe value of \\( c \\) is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
