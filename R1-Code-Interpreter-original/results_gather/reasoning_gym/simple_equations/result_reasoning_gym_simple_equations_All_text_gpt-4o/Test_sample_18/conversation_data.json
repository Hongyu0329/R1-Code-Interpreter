    "To solve the equation \\(61p - 35 = 4174\\) for \\(p\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation is a linear equation in the form of \\(ax + b = c\\), where \\(a = 61\\), \\(b = -35\\), and \\(c = 4174\\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Term with \\(p\\)**: To isolate the term with \\(p\\), we need to eliminate the constant term on the left side of the equation. We do this by adding 35 to both sides of the equation:\n\n   \\[\n   61p - 35 + 35 = 4174 + 35\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying both sides, we get:\n\n   \\[\n   61p = 4209\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(p\\)**: Now that we have isolated the term with \\(p\\), we need to solve for \\(p\\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 61:\n\n   \\[\n   p = \\frac{4209}{61}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Perform the Division**: Calculate the division to find the value of \\(p\\):\n\n   \\[\n   p = 69\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**: To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \\(p = 69\\) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal:\n\n   \\[\n   61 \\times 69 - 35 = 4174\n   \\]\n\n   Calculate \\(61 \\times 69\\):\n\n   \\[\n   61 \\times 69 = 4209\n   \\]\n\n   Subtract 35 from 4209:\n\n   \\[\n   4209 - 35 = 4174\n   \\]\n\n   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution is verified.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<69>>>"
