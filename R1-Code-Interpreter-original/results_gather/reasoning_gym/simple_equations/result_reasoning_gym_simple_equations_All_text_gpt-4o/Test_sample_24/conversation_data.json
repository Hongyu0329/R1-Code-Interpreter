    "To determine the value of \\( r \\) that satisfies the equation \\( 61 - 99r = -5285 \\), we will solve the equation step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Equation\nThe given equation is:\n\\[ 61 - 99r = -5285 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Isolate the Term with \\( r \\)\nTo isolate the term with \\( r \\), we need to move the constant term (61) to the other side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 61 from both sides:\n\\[ 61 - 99r - 61 = -5285 - 61 \\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ -99r = -5346 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Solve for \\( r \\)\nNow, we need to solve for \\( r \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by -99:\n\\[ r = \\frac{-5346}{-99} \\]\n\n### Step 4: Simplify the Division\nPerform the division:\n\\[ r = \\frac{5346}{99} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Division\nTo find the value of \\( r \\), divide 5346 by 99:\n\\[ r = 54 \\]\n\n### Conclusion\nThe value of \\( r \\) that satisfies the equation is 54.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<54>>>"
