    "To solve the equation \\(6480v - 182 = 570058\\) for \\(v\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation is a linear equation in the form of \\(ax + b = c\\), where \\(a = 6480\\), \\(b = -182\\), and \\(c = 570058\\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Variable**: We need to solve for \\(v\\), so we should isolate \\(v\\) on one side of the equation. We can do this by first eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.\n\n3. **Add 182 to Both Sides**: To eliminate \\(-182\\) from the left side, add 182 to both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   6480v - 182 + 182 = 570058 + 182\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   6480v = 570240\n   \\]\n\n4. **Divide by the Coefficient of \\(v\\)**: Now, divide both sides of the equation by 6480 to solve for \\(v\\):\n   \\[\n   v = \\frac{570240}{6480}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the Division**: Perform the division to find the value of \\(v\\):\n   \\[\n   v = 88\n   \\]\n\n6. **Verify the Solution**: To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \\(v = 88\\) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal:\n   \\[\n   6480 \\times 88 - 182 = 570058\n   \\]\n   Calculate the left side:\n   \\[\n   6480 \\times 88 = 570240\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   570240 - 182 = 570058\n   \\]\n   Since both sides are equal, the solution is verified.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<88>>>"
