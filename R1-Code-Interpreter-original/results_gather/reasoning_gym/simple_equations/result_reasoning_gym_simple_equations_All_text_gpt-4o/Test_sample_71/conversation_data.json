    "To determine the value of \\( w \\) that satisfies the equation \\( 89w - 5 = 1419 \\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation given is \\( 89w - 5 = 1419 \\). This is a linear equation in one variable, \\( w \\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Variable**: To solve for \\( w \\), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.\n\n3. **Add 5 to Both Sides**: To remove the \\(-5\\) from the left side, add 5 to both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   89w - 5 + 5 = 1419 + 5\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   89w = 1424\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( w \\)**: Now, we need to solve for \\( w \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 89:\n   \\[\n   w = \\frac{1424}{89}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Perform the Division**: Calculate the division to find the value of \\( w \\):\n   \\[\n   w = 16\n   \\]\n\n6. **Verify the Solution**: To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \\( w = 16 \\) back into the original equation:\n   \\[\n   89 \\times 16 - 5 = 1419\n   \\]\n   Calculate the left side:\n   \\[\n   1424 - 5 = 1419\n   \\]\n   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution is verified.\n\nThe value of \\( w \\) that satisfies the equation is \\( 16 \\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<16>>>"
