    "To find the value of \\( o \\) in the equation \\( 12o + 71 = 1091 \\), we will solve the equation step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation given is \\( 12o + 71 = 1091 \\). Our goal is to isolate \\( o \\) on one side of the equation.\n\n2. **Subtract 71 from Both Sides**: To begin isolating \\( o \\), subtract 71 from both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant term on the left side.\n   \\[\n   12o + 71 - 71 = 1091 - 71\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   12o = 1020\n   \\]\n\n3. **Divide Both Sides by 12**: Now, divide both sides of the equation by 12 to solve for \\( o \\).\n   \\[\n   \\frac{12o}{12} = \\frac{1020}{12}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   o = 85\n   \\]\n\n4. **Verify the Solution**: To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \\( o = 85 \\) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.\n   \\[\n   12 \\times 85 + 71 = 1091\n   \\]\n   Calculate the left side:\n   \\[\n   1020 + 71 = 1091\n   \\]\n   Since both sides are equal, the solution is verified.\n\nThe value of \\( o \\) is \\( 85 \\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<85>>>"
