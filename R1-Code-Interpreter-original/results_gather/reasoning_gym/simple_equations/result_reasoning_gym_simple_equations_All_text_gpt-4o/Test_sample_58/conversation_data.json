    "To solve the equation \\( 61008g - 74 = 2440246 \\) for \\( g \\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation is a linear equation in the form \\( ax + b = c \\), where \\( a = 61008 \\), \\( b = -74 \\), and \\( c = 2440246 \\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Term with \\( g \\)**: To isolate the term with \\( g \\), we need to eliminate the constant term on the left side of the equation. We do this by adding 74 to both sides of the equation:\n\n   \\[\n   61008g - 74 + 74 = 2440246 + 74\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n\n   \\[\n   61008g = 2440320\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( g \\)**: Now that we have isolated the term with \\( g \\), we can solve for \\( g \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 61008:\n\n   \\[\n   g = \\frac{2440320}{61008}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Perform the Division**: Calculate the division to find the value of \\( g \\):\n\n   \\[\n   g = 40\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**: To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \\( g = 40 \\) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal:\n\n   \\[\n   61008 \\times 40 - 74 = 2440246\n   \\]\n\n   Calculate the left side:\n\n   \\[\n   2440320 - 74 = 2440246\n   \\]\n\n   Since both sides are equal, the solution is verified.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<40>>>"
