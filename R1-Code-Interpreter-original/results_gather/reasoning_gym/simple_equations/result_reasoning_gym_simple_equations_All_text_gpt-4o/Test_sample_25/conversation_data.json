    "To determine the value of \\( b \\) that satisfies the equation \\( 66b + 75 = 3771 \\), we will solve the equation step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: \n   - We have the equation \\( 66b + 75 = 3771 \\).\n   - Our goal is to isolate \\( b \\) on one side of the equation to find its value.\n\n2. **Isolate the Term with \\( b \\)**:\n   - Subtract 75 from both sides of the equation to remove the constant term on the left side.\n   - This gives us: \n     \\[\n     66b + 75 - 75 = 3771 - 75\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying both sides, we get:\n     \\[\n     66b = 3696\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( b \\)**:\n   - Now, divide both sides of the equation by 66 to solve for \\( b \\).\n   - This gives us:\n     \\[\n     b = \\frac{3696}{66}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Perform the Division**:\n   - Calculate \\( \\frac{3696}{66} \\).\n   - Performing the division, we find:\n     \\[\n     b = 56\n     \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - Substitute \\( b = 56 \\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.\n   - Calculate \\( 66 \\times 56 + 75 \\):\n     \\[\n     66 \\times 56 = 3696\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     3696 + 75 = 3771\n     \\]\n   - The left side equals the right side, confirming that \\( b = 56 \\) is correct.\n\nThe value of \\( b \\) that satisfies the equation is \\( 56 \\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<56>>>"
