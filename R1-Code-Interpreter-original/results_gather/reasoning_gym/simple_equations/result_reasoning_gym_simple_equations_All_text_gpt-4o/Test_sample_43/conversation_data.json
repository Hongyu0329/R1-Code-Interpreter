    "To determine the value of \\( o \\) that satisfies the equation \\(-1566 \\times o = -20358\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation given is \\(-1566 \\times o = -20358\\). This is a simple linear equation where we need to solve for the variable \\( o \\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Variable**: To find the value of \\( o \\), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. This can be done by dividing both sides of the equation by \\(-1566\\).\n\n3. **Perform the Division**: \n   \\[\n   o = \\frac{-20358}{-1566}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the Division**: Since both the numerator and the denominator are negative, the result will be positive. We need to perform the division:\n   \\[\n   o = \\frac{20358}{1566}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the Division**: Perform the division to find the value of \\( o \\):\n   - Divide 20358 by 1566.\n   - 20358 divided by 1566 equals 13.\n\n6. **Verify the Calculation**: To ensure the calculation is correct, multiply the result back by \\(-1566\\) to see if it equals \\(-20358\\):\n   \\[\n   13 \\times -1566 = -20358\n   \\]\n   The calculation is correct.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: The value of \\( o \\) that satisfies the equation is 13.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<13>>>"
