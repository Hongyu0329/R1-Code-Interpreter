    "To solve the equation \\(896 \\times r = 78848\\) for \\(r\\), we need to isolate \\(r\\) on one side of the equation. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation given is \\(896 \\times r = 78848\\). This is a simple linear equation where \\(r\\) is multiplied by 896.\n\n2. **Objective**: Our goal is to solve for \\(r\\), which means we need to find the value of \\(r\\) that makes the equation true.\n\n3. **Isolate \\(r\\)**: To isolate \\(r\\), we need to divide both sides of the equation by 896. This is because \\(r\\) is currently being multiplied by 896, and division is the inverse operation of multiplication.\n\n4. **Perform the Division**: \n   \\[\n   r = \\frac{78848}{896}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the Division**: \n   - First, check if 78848 is divisible by 896 without a remainder. \n   - Perform the division: \\(78848 \\div 896\\).\n\n6. **Verify the Calculation**: \n   - After performing the division, ensure that the result is a whole number, confirming that 78848 is exactly divisible by 896.\n\n7. **Result**: The division yields \\(r = 88\\).\n\n8. **Verification**: \n   - Multiply 896 by 88 to check if it equals 78848.\n   - \\(896 \\times 88 = 78848\\), confirming the solution is correct.\n\nBy following these steps, we have determined the value of \\(r\\).\n\nThe final answer is: <<<88>>>."
