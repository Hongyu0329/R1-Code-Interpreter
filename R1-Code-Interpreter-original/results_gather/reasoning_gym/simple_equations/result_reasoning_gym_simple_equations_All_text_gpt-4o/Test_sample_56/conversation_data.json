    "To solve the equation \\(68m - 24 = 112\\) for \\(m\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation is a linear equation in the form of \\(ax + b = c\\), where \\(a = 68\\), \\(b = -24\\), and \\(c = 112\\). We need to solve for \\(m\\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Term with \\(m\\)**: \n   - Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation. To do this, add 24 to both sides of the equation to cancel out the \\(-24\\).\n   \\[\n   68m - 24 + 24 = 112 + 24\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   68m = 136\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(m\\)**:\n   - Now, divide both sides of the equation by 68 to solve for \\(m\\).\n   \\[\n   m = \\frac{136}{68}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the Fraction**:\n   - Simplify \\(\\frac{136}{68}\\) by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 136 and 68. The GCD is 68.\n   - Divide both the numerator and the denominator by 68:\n   \\[\n   m = \\frac{136 \\div 68}{68 \\div 68} = \\frac{2}{1} = 2\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - Substitute \\(m = 2\\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:\n   \\[\n   68 \\times 2 - 24 = 136 - 24 = 112\n   \\]\n   - The left side equals the right side, confirming that \\(m = 2\\) is the correct solution.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<2>>>"
