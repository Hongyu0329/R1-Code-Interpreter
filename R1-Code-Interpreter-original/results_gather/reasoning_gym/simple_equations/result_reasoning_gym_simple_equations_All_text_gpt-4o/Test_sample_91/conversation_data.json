    "To determine the value of \\( b \\) that satisfies the equation \\( 8904 \\times b = 436296 \\), we need to solve for \\( b \\). Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation given is \\( 8904 \\times b = 436296 \\). This is a simple linear equation where \\( b \\) is the unknown variable we need to solve for.\n\n2. **Isolate the Variable**: To find \\( b \\), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. This can be done by dividing both sides of the equation by 8904.\n\n3. **Perform the Division**: \n   \\[\n   b = \\frac{436296}{8904}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Division**: Perform the division to find the value of \\( b \\).\n\n   - First, check if 436296 is divisible by 8904 without a remainder. This can be done by performing the division:\n   \\[\n   436296 \\div 8904 = 49\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Calculation**: To ensure the division is correct, multiply the result by 8904 to see if it equals 436296:\n   \\[\n   8904 \\times 49 = 436296\n   \\]\n   Since the multiplication gives the original number, the division was performed correctly.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The value of \\( b \\) that satisfies the equation is 49.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<49>>>"
