    "To solve the equation \\(44l - 78 = 54\\) for \\(l\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \\(l\\). Our goal is to isolate \\(l\\) on one side of the equation to find its value.\n\n2. **Add 78 to Both Sides**: To eliminate the constant term \\(-78\\) on the left side, add 78 to both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   44l - 78 + 78 = 54 + 78\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   44l = 132\n   \\]\n\n3. **Divide Both Sides by 44**: To solve for \\(l\\), divide both sides of the equation by 44:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{44l}{44} = \\frac{132}{44}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the right side gives:\n   \\[\n   l = 3\n   \\]\n\n4. **Verify the Solution**: Substitute \\(l = 3\\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:\n   \\[\n   44 \\times 3 - 78 = 54\n   \\]\n   Calculate the left side:\n   \\[\n   132 - 78 = 54\n   \\]\n   Since both sides are equal, the solution \\(l = 3\\) is verified.\n\nTherefore, the value of \\(l\\) is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).\n\nThe final answer is: <<<3>>>."
