    "To find the value of \\( c \\) in the equation \\( 20 - 11c = -409 \\), we will solve the equation step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the equation**: The equation given is \\( 20 - 11c = -409 \\). Our goal is to isolate \\( c \\) on one side of the equation.\n\n2. **Move the constant term to the other side**: \n   - We have \\( 20 \\) on the left side of the equation. To isolate the term with \\( c \\), subtract \\( 20 \\) from both sides of the equation.\n   - This gives us: \n     \\[\n     20 - 11c - 20 = -409 - 20\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying both sides, we get:\n     \\[\n     -11c = -429\n     \\]\n\n3. **Isolate \\( c \\)**:\n   - Now, we need to solve for \\( c \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by \\(-11\\).\n   - This gives us:\n     \\[\n     c = \\frac{-429}{-11}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the division**:\n   - Perform the division:\n     \\[\n     c = 39\n     \\]\n\n5. **Verify the solution**:\n   - Substitute \\( c = 39 \\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:\n     \\[\n     20 - 11 \\times 39 = 20 - 429 = -409\n     \\]\n   - The left side equals the right side, confirming that our solution is correct.\n\nThe value of \\( c \\) is \\( 39 \\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<39>>>"
