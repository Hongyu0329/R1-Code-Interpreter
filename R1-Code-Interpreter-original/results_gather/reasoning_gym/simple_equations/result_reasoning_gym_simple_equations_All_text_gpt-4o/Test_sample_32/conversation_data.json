    "To find the value of \\( p \\) in the equation \\( 5589 \\times p = 16767 \\), we need to solve for \\( p \\). Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation given is \\( 5589 \\times p = 16767 \\). This is a simple linear equation where \\( p \\) is multiplied by 5589 to give 16767.\n\n2. **Isolate \\( p \\)**: To find the value of \\( p \\), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. This can be done by dividing both sides of the equation by 5589.\n\n3. **Perform the Division**: \n   \\[\n   p = \\frac{16767}{5589}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Division**: \n   - First, check if 16767 is divisible by 5589 without a remainder. \n   - Perform the division: \\( 16767 \\div 5589 \\).\n\n5. **Simplify the Result**: \n   - If the division results in a whole number, that is the value of \\( p \\).\n   - If not, the division might need to be expressed as a fraction or decimal.\n\n6. **Verify the Calculation**: \n   - Multiply the result by 5589 to ensure it equals 16767, confirming the correctness of the division.\n\nNow, let's perform the division:\n\n- \\( 16767 \\div 5589 = 3 \\).\n\nThis division results in a whole number, indicating that \\( p = 3 \\).\n\n7. **Verification**: \n   - Multiply 5589 by 3 to check: \\( 5589 \\times 3 = 16767 \\).\n   - The multiplication confirms the division was correct.\n\nTherefore, the value of \\( p \\) is 3.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<3>>>."
