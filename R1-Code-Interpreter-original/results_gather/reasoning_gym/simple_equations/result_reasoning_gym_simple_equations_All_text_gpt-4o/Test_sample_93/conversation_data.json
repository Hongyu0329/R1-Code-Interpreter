    "To determine the value of \\( h \\) that satisfies the equation \\( 45h + 39 = 1839 \\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation given is a linear equation in the form of \\( ax + b = c \\), where \\( a = 45 \\), \\( b = 39 \\), and \\( c = 1839 \\). Our goal is to solve for \\( h \\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Term with \\( h \\)**: To isolate the term with \\( h \\), we need to eliminate the constant term on the left side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 39 from both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   45h + 39 - 39 = 1839 - 39\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both sides, we get:\n   \\[\n   45h = 1800\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( h \\)**: Now that we have isolated the term with \\( h \\), we can solve for \\( h \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 45:\n   \\[\n   h = \\frac{1800}{45}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Perform the Division**: Calculate the division to find the value of \\( h \\):\n   \\[\n   h = 40\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**: To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \\( h = 40 \\) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal:\n   \\[\n   45 \\times 40 + 39 = 1839\n   \\]\n   Calculate the left side:\n   \\[\n   1800 + 39 = 1839\n   \\]\n   Since both sides are equal, the solution is verified.\n\nThe value of \\( h \\) that satisfies the equation is \\( 40 \\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<40>>>."
