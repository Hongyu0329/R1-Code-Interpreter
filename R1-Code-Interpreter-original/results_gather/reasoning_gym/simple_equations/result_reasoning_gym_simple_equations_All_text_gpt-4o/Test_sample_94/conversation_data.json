    "To solve the equation \\(74 - 32s = -1878\\) for \\(s\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Isolate the term with \\(s\\):**  \n   Start by moving the constant term on the left side of the equation to the right side. This can be done by subtracting 74 from both sides of the equation.\n\n   \\[\n   74 - 32s - 74 = -1878 - 74\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n\n   \\[\n   -32s = -1952\n   \\]\n\n2. **Solve for \\(s\\):**  \n   Now, we need to isolate \\(s\\) by dividing both sides of the equation by \\(-32\\).\n\n   \\[\n   s = \\frac{-1952}{-32}\n   \\]\n\n   Since dividing two negative numbers results in a positive number, we simplify the division:\n\n   \\[\n   s = \\frac{1952}{32}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the fraction:**  \n   To simplify \\(\\frac{1952}{32}\\), we can perform the division:\n\n   \\[\n   1952 \\div 32 = 61\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, \\(s = 61\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<61>>>"
