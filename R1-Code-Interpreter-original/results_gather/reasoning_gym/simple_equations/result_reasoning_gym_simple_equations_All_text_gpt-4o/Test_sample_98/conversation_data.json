    "To solve the equation \\(120 - 83q = -6105\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation is a linear equation in the form of \\(ax + b = c\\), where \\(a = -83\\), \\(b = 120\\), and \\(c = -6105\\). We need to solve for \\(q\\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Term with \\(q\\)**: To isolate the term with \\(q\\), we need to move the constant term (120) to the other side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 120 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   120 - 83q - 120 = -6105 - 120\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   -83q = -6225\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(q\\)**: Now, we need to solve for \\(q\\) by dividing both sides of the equation by \\(-83\\):\n   \\[\n   q = \\frac{-6225}{-83}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Division**: Perform the division to find the value of \\(q\\):\n   \\[\n   q = 75\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**: To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \\(q = 75\\) back into the original equation:\n   \\[\n   120 - 83 \\times 75 = 120 - 6225 = -6105\n   \\]\n   The left side equals the right side, confirming that the solution is correct.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<75>>>"
