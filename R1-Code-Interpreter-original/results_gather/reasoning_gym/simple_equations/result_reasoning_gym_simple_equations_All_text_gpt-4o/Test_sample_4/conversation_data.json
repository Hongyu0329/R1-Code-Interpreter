    "To find the value of \\( k \\) in the equation \\( k - 37 = -14 \\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation given is \\( k - 37 = -14 \\). This is a simple linear equation where we need to solve for the variable \\( k \\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Variable**: To find the value of \\( k \\), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Currently, \\( k \\) is on the left side, but it is being subtracted by 37.\n\n3. **Add 37 to Both Sides**: To cancel out the \\(-37\\) on the left side, we add 37 to both sides of the equation. This step is crucial to maintain the equality:\n\n   \\[\n   k - 37 + 37 = -14 + 37\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify Both Sides**: Simplifying both sides of the equation gives:\n\n   \\[\n   k = 23\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**: To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \\( k = 23 \\) back into the original equation:\n\n   \\[\n   23 - 37 = -14\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying the left side:\n\n   \\[\n   -14 = -14\n   \\]\n\n   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution is verified.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The value of \\( k \\) that satisfies the equation is 23.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<23>>>"
