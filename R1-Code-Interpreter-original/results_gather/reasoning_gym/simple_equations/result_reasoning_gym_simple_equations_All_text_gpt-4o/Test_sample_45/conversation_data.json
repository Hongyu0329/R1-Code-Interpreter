    "To find the value of \\( z \\) in the equation \\( 465z + 806 = 37541 \\), we will solve the equation step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: \n   - The equation given is \\( 465z + 806 = 37541 \\).\n   - Our goal is to isolate \\( z \\) on one side of the equation.\n\n2. **Isolate the Term with \\( z \\)**:\n   - Subtract 806 from both sides of the equation to remove the constant term on the left side.\n   - This gives us: \n     \\[\n     465z = 37541 - 806\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Right Side**:\n   - Perform the subtraction:\n     \\[\n     37541 - 806 = 36735\n     \\]\n   - Now the equation is:\n     \\[\n     465z = 36735\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( z \\)**:\n   - Divide both sides of the equation by 465 to solve for \\( z \\).\n   - This gives us:\n     \\[\n     z = \\frac{36735}{465}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Perform the Division**:\n   - Calculate the division:\n     \\[\n     z = 79\n     \\]\n\n6. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - Substitute \\( z = 79 \\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:\n     \\[\n     465 \\times 79 + 806 = 37541\n     \\]\n   - Calculate \\( 465 \\times 79 \\):\n     \\[\n     465 \\times 79 = 36735\n     \\]\n   - Add 806 to 36735:\n     \\[\n     36735 + 806 = 37541\n     \\]\n   - The left side equals the right side, confirming that \\( z = 79 \\) is correct.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<79>>>"
