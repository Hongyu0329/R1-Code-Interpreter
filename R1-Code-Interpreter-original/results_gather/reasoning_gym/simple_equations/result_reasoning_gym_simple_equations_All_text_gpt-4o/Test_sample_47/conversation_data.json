    "To solve the equation \\(32e - 98 = 190\\) for \\(e\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation is a linear equation in the form of \\(ax + b = c\\), where \\(a = 32\\), \\(b = -98\\), and \\(c = 190\\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Variable**: The goal is to solve for \\(e\\). To do this, we need to isolate \\(e\\) on one side of the equation.\n\n3. **Add 98 to Both Sides**: To eliminate the \\(-98\\) on the left side, add 98 to both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   32e - 98 + 98 = 190 + 98\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   32e = 288\n   \\]\n\n4. **Divide by 32**: To solve for \\(e\\), divide both sides of the equation by 32:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{32e}{32} = \\frac{288}{32}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the right side gives:\n   \\[\n   e = 9\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**: Substitute \\(e = 9\\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:\n   \\[\n   32 \\times 9 - 98 = 190\n   \\]\n   Calculate \\(32 \\times 9\\):\n   \\[\n   288 - 98 = 190\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the left side gives:\n   \\[\n   190 = 190\n   \\]\n   Since both sides are equal, the solution is verified.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<9>>>"
