    "To solve the equation \\(3420w - 1440 = 265320\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation is a linear equation in the form of \\(ax + b = c\\), where \\(a = 3420\\), \\(b = -1440\\), and \\(c = 265320\\). We need to solve for \\(w\\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Term with the Variable**: \n   - Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation. Add 1440 to both sides to move the constant term to the right side:\n     \\[\n     3420w - 1440 + 1440 = 265320 + 1440\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying both sides gives:\n     \\[\n     3420w = 266760\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve for the Variable**:\n   - Now, divide both sides of the equation by 3420 to solve for \\(w\\):\n     \\[\n     w = \\frac{266760}{3420}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Perform the Division**:\n   - Calculate the division:\n     \\[\n     w = 78\n     \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - Substitute \\(w = 78\\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:\n     \\[\n     3420 \\times 78 - 1440 = 265320\n     \\]\n   - Calculate \\(3420 \\times 78\\):\n     \\[\n     3420 \\times 78 = 266760\n     \\]\n   - Subtract 1440 from 266760:\n     \\[\n     266760 - 1440 = 265320\n     \\]\n   - The left side equals the right side, confirming that \\(w = 78\\) is correct.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<78>>>"
