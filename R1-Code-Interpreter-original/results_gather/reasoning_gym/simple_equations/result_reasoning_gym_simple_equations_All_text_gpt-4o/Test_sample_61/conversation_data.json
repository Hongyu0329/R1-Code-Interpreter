    "To determine the value of \\( p \\) that satisfies the equation \\( 19p + 151 = 246 \\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation given is a linear equation in the form of \\( ax + b = c \\), where \\( a = 19 \\), \\( b = 151 \\), and \\( c = 246 \\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Variable**: We need to solve for \\( p \\). To do this, we first need to isolate the term containing \\( p \\) on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 151 from both sides of the equation:\n\n   \\[\n   19p + 151 - 151 = 246 - 151\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying both sides, we get:\n\n   \\[\n   19p = 95\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( p \\)**: Now that we have isolated the term with \\( p \\), we can solve for \\( p \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 19:\n\n   \\[\n   p = \\frac{95}{19}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the Fraction**: Calculate the division to find the value of \\( p \\):\n\n   \\[\n   p = 5\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**: To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \\( p = 5 \\) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal:\n\n   \\[\n   19 \\times 5 + 151 = 95 + 151 = 246\n   \\]\n\n   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution is verified.\n\nThe value of \\( p \\) that satisfies the equation is \\( 5 \\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<5>>>"
