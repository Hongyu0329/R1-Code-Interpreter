    "To determine the value of \\( e \\) that satisfies the equation \\( 50e - 14 = 4636 \\), we will solve the equation step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The given equation is \\( 50e - 14 = 4636 \\). Our goal is to solve for \\( e \\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Term with \\( e \\)**: \n   - To isolate the term with \\( e \\), we need to get rid of the constant term on the left side of the equation. \n   - Add 14 to both sides of the equation to eliminate the \\(-14\\) on the left side:\n     \\[\n     50e - 14 + 14 = 4636 + 14\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying both sides gives:\n     \\[\n     50e = 4650\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( e \\)**:\n   - Now, we need to solve for \\( e \\) by isolating it. Since \\( e \\) is multiplied by 50, we will divide both sides of the equation by 50:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{50e}{50} = \\frac{4650}{50}\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying the right side gives:\n     \\[\n     e = 93\n     \\]\n\n4. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \\( e = 93 \\) back into the original equation:\n     \\[\n     50 \\times 93 - 14 = 4636\n     \\]\n   - Calculate \\( 50 \\times 93 \\):\n     \\[\n     50 \\times 93 = 4650\n     \\]\n   - Subtract 14 from 4650:\n     \\[\n     4650 - 14 = 4636\n     \\]\n   - Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution \\( e = 93 \\) is verified.\n\nThe value of \\( e \\) that satisfies the equation is \\(\\boxed{93}\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<93>>>"
