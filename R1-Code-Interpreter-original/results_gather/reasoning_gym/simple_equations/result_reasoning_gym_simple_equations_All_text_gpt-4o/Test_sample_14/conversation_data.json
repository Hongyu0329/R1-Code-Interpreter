    "To find the value of \\( c \\) in the equation \\( 82c - 152 = 258 \\), we will solve the equation step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The given equation is \\( 82c - 152 = 258 \\). Our goal is to isolate \\( c \\) on one side of the equation.\n\n2. **Eliminate the Constant Term**: \n   - The equation has a constant term \\(-152\\) on the left side. To eliminate this, we add 152 to both sides of the equation.\n   - This gives us: \n     \\[\n     82c - 152 + 152 = 258 + 152\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying both sides, we get:\n     \\[\n     82c = 410\n     \\]\n\n3. **Isolate the Variable**:\n   - Now, we need to solve for \\( c \\) by isolating it. Since \\( c \\) is multiplied by 82, we divide both sides of the equation by 82 to solve for \\( c \\).\n   - This gives us:\n     \\[\n     c = \\frac{410}{82}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the Fraction**:\n   - To simplify \\(\\frac{410}{82}\\), we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 410 and 82.\n   - The GCD of 410 and 82 is 2.\n   - Divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2:\n     \\[\n     c = \\frac{410 \\div 2}{82 \\div 2} = \\frac{205}{41}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Check for Further Simplification**:\n   - Check if \\(\\frac{205}{41}\\) can be simplified further. Since 205 and 41 have no common factors other than 1, the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\n6. **Final Answer**:\n   - The value of \\( c \\) is \\(\\frac{205}{41}\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\\(\\frac{205}{41}\\)>>>"
