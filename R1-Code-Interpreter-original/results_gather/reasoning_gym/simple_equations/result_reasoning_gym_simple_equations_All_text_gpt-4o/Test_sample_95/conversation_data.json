    "To solve the equation \\( 2555b - 9 = 219721 \\) for \\( b \\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation is a linear equation in the form of \\( ax + b = c \\), where \\( a = 2555 \\), \\( b = -9 \\), and \\( c = 219721 \\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Term with \\( b \\)**: To isolate the term with \\( b \\), we need to eliminate the constant term on the left side of the equation. We do this by adding 9 to both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   2555b - 9 + 9 = 219721 + 9\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both sides, we get:\n   \\[\n   2555b = 219730\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( b \\)**: Now that we have isolated the term with \\( b \\), we can solve for \\( b \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2555:\n   \\[\n   b = \\frac{219730}{2555}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Perform the Division**: Calculate the division to find the value of \\( b \\):\n   \\[\n   b = 86\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**: To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \\( b = 86 \\) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal:\n   \\[\n   2555 \\times 86 - 9 = 219721\n   \\]\n   Calculate the left side:\n   \\[\n   2555 \\times 86 = 219730\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   219730 - 9 = 219721\n   \\]\n   Since both sides are equal, the solution is verified.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<86>>>"
