    "To solve the equation \\(6s + 95 = 407\\) for \\(s\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation is a linear equation in one variable, \\(s\\). Our goal is to isolate \\(s\\) on one side of the equation.\n\n2. **Subtract 95 from Both Sides**: To begin isolating \\(s\\), we need to eliminate the constant term on the left side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 95 from both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   6s + 95 - 95 = 407 - 95\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   6s = 312\n   \\]\n\n3. **Divide Both Sides by 6**: Now that we have \\(6s = 312\\), we need to solve for \\(s\\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 6:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{6s}{6} = \\frac{312}{6}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   s = 52\n   \\]\n\n4. **Verify the Solution**: To ensure our solution is correct, we can substitute \\(s = 52\\) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal:\n   \\[\n   6(52) + 95 = 407\n   \\]\n   Calculating the left side:\n   \\[\n   312 + 95 = 407\n   \\]\n   Since both sides are equal, our solution is verified.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<52>>>"
