    "To determine the value of \\( m \\) that satisfies the equation \\( 89m + 52 = 8418 \\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation given is a linear equation in the form of \\( ax + b = c \\), where \\( a = 89 \\), \\( b = 52 \\), and \\( c = 8418 \\). We need to solve for \\( m \\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Term with \\( m \\)**: To isolate the term with \\( m \\), subtract 52 from both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   89m + 52 - 52 = 8418 - 52\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   89m = 8366\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( m \\)**: Now, divide both sides of the equation by 89 to solve for \\( m \\):\n   \\[\n   m = \\frac{8366}{89}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Perform the Division**: Calculate the division to find the value of \\( m \\):\n   - Divide 8366 by 89.\n   - Perform the division step by step:\n     - 89 goes into 8366 approximately 94 times (since \\( 89 \\times 94 = 8366 \\)).\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**: To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \\( m = 94 \\) back into the original equation:\n   \\[\n   89 \\times 94 + 52 = 8418\n   \\]\n   - Calculate \\( 89 \\times 94 = 8366 \\).\n   - Add 52 to 8366, which results in 8418.\n   - Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution is verified.\n\nTherefore, the value of \\( m \\) that satisfies the equation is 94.\n\nFinal answer: <<<94>>>."
