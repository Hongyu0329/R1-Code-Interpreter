    "To solve the equation \\(37l - 94 = 2274\\) for \\(l\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation is a linear equation in one variable, \\(l\\). Our goal is to isolate \\(l\\) on one side of the equation.\n\n2. **Add 94 to Both Sides**: To eliminate the constant term on the left side, add 94 to both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   37l - 94 + 94 = 2274 + 94\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   37l = 2368\n   \\]\n\n3. **Divide Both Sides by 37**: To solve for \\(l\\), divide both sides of the equation by 37:\n   \\[\n   l = \\frac{2368}{37}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Division**: Perform the division to find the value of \\(l\\):\n   \\[\n   l = 64\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**: Substitute \\(l = 64\\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:\n   \\[\n   37 \\times 64 - 94 = 2274\n   \\]\n   Calculate \\(37 \\times 64\\):\n   \\[\n   37 \\times 64 = 2368\n   \\]\n   Then subtract 94:\n   \\[\n   2368 - 94 = 2274\n   \\]\n   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution is verified.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<64>>>"
