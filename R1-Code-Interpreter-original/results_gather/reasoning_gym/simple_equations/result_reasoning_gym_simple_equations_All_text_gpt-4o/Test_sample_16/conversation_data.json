    "To solve the equation \\(-39r - 55 = -3643\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Isolate the term with the variable**: \n   - Start by getting rid of the constant term on the left side of the equation. To do this, add 55 to both sides of the equation:\n     \\[\n     -39r - 55 + 55 = -3643 + 55\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying both sides gives:\n     \\[\n     -39r = -3588\n     \\]\n\n2. **Solve for the variable**:\n   - Now, we need to isolate \\(r\\) by dividing both sides of the equation by \\(-39\\):\n     \\[\n     r = \\frac{-3588}{-39}\n     \\]\n   - Since both the numerator and the denominator are negative, the result will be positive. Perform the division:\n     \\[\n     r = 92\n     \\]\n\n3. **Verify the solution**:\n   - Substitute \\(r = 92\\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:\n     \\[\n     -39(92) - 55 = -3643\n     \\]\n   - Calculate \\(-39 \\times 92\\):\n     \\[\n     -39 \\times 92 = -3588\n     \\]\n   - Substitute back:\n     \\[\n     -3588 - 55 = -3643\n     \\]\n   - Simplify the left side:\n     \\[\n     -3643 = -3643\n     \\]\n   - The left side equals the right side, confirming that \\(r = 92\\) is indeed the correct solution.\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{92}\\).\n\n<<<92>>>"
