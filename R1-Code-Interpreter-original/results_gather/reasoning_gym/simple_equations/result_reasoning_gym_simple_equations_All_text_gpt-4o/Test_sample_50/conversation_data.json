    "To solve the equation \\(88e + 15 = 455\\) for \\(e\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation is a linear equation in the form of \\(ax + b = c\\), where \\(a = 88\\), \\(b = 15\\), and \\(c = 455\\). We need to isolate \\(e\\) on one side of the equation.\n\n2. **Subtract 15 from Both Sides**: To begin isolating \\(e\\), subtract 15 from both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant term on the left side.\n   \\[\n   88e + 15 - 15 = 455 - 15\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   88e = 440\n   \\]\n\n3. **Divide Both Sides by 88**: Now, divide both sides of the equation by 88 to solve for \\(e\\).\n   \\[\n   \\frac{88e}{88} = \\frac{440}{88}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the right side gives:\n   \\[\n   e = 5\n   \\]\n\n4. **Verify the Solution**: Substitute \\(e = 5\\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.\n   \\[\n   88 \\times 5 + 15 = 440 + 15 = 455\n   \\]\n   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution is verified.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<5>>>"
