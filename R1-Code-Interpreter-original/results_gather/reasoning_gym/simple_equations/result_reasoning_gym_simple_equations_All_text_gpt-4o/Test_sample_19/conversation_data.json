    "To determine the value of \\( h \\) that satisfies the equation \\( 20 - 51h = -3448 \\), we will solve the equation step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation:**\n   - The given equation is \\( 20 - 51h = -3448 \\).\n   - We need to isolate \\( h \\) on one side of the equation to find its value.\n\n2. **Isolate the Term with \\( h \\):**\n   - Start by moving the constant term (20) to the other side of the equation.\n   - Subtract 20 from both sides:\n     \\[\n     20 - 51h - 20 = -3448 - 20\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying both sides gives:\n     \\[\n     -51h = -3468\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( h \\):**\n   - Now, divide both sides by -51 to solve for \\( h \\):\n     \\[\n     h = \\frac{-3468}{-51}\n     \\]\n   - Simplify the division:\n     \\[\n     h = 68\n     \\]\n\n4. **Verify the Solution:**\n   - Substitute \\( h = 68 \\) back into the original equation to verify:\n     \\[\n     20 - 51 \\times 68 = -3448\n     \\]\n   - Calculate \\( 51 \\times 68 \\):\n     \\[\n     51 \\times 68 = 3468\n     \\]\n   - Substitute back:\n     \\[\n     20 - 3468 = -3448\n     \\]\n   - Simplify:\n     \\[\n     -3448 = -3448\n     \\]\n   - The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming that \\( h = 68 \\) is correct.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe value of \\( h \\) that satisfies the equation is \\(\\boxed{68}\\).\n\n<<<68>>>"
