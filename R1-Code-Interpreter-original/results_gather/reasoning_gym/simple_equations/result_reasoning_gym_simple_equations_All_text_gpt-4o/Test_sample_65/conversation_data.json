    "To solve the equation \\(72g + 67 = 6979\\) for \\(g\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation is a linear equation in the form of \\(ax + b = c\\), where \\(a = 72\\), \\(b = 67\\), and \\(c = 6979\\). We need to solve for \\(g\\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Term with \\(g\\)**: \n   - Subtract 67 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \\(g\\).\n   - This gives us: \n     \\[\n     72g + 67 - 67 = 6979 - 67\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying both sides, we have:\n     \\[\n     72g = 6912\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(g\\)**:\n   - Divide both sides of the equation by 72 to solve for \\(g\\).\n   - This gives us:\n     \\[\n     g = \\frac{6912}{72}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Perform the Division**:\n   - Calculate \\(\\frac{6912}{72}\\).\n   - Performing the division, we find:\n     \\[\n     g = 96\n     \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - Substitute \\(g = 96\\) back into the original equation to verify:\n     \\[\n     72 \\times 96 + 67 = 6912 + 67 = 6979\n     \\]\n   - The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming that \\(g = 96\\) is correct.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the equation is:\n\n<<<96>>>"
