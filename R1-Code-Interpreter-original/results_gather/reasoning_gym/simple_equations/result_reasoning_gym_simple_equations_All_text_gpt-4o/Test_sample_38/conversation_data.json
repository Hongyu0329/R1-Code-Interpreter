    "To determine the value of \\( d \\) that satisfies the equation \\( 2478d + 58 = 215644 \\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation given is a linear equation in the form of \\( ax + b = c \\), where \\( a = 2478 \\), \\( b = 58 \\), and \\( c = 215644 \\). We need to solve for \\( d \\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Variable**: To find \\( d \\), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by first subtracting 58 from both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant term on the left side.\n\n   \\[\n   2478d + 58 - 58 = 215644 - 58\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n\n   \\[\n   2478d = 215586\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( d \\)**: Now that we have \\( 2478d = 215586 \\), we can solve for \\( d \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2478.\n\n   \\[\n   d = \\frac{215586}{2478}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Perform the Division**: Calculate the division to find the value of \\( d \\).\n\n   \\[\n   d = 87\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**: To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \\( d = 87 \\) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.\n\n   \\[\n   2478 \\times 87 + 58 = 215644\n   \\]\n\n   Calculate \\( 2478 \\times 87 \\):\n\n   \\[\n   2478 \\times 87 = 215586\n   \\]\n\n   Add 58 to the result:\n\n   \\[\n   215586 + 58 = 215644\n   \\]\n\n   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution is verified.\n\nThe value of \\( d \\) that satisfies the equation is:\n\n<<<87>>>"
