    "To find the value of \\( n \\) in the equation \\( 87n - 74 = 1753 \\), we will solve the equation step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the equation**: The equation given is \\( 87n - 74 = 1753 \\). Our goal is to isolate \\( n \\) on one side of the equation.\n\n2. **Add 74 to both sides**: To eliminate the \\(-74\\) on the left side, add 74 to both sides of the equation.\n   \\[\n   87n - 74 + 74 = 1753 + 74\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   87n = 1827\n   \\]\n\n3. **Divide both sides by 87**: To solve for \\( n \\), divide both sides of the equation by 87.\n   \\[\n   n = \\frac{1827}{87}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Perform the division**: Calculate the division to find the value of \\( n \\).\n   \\[\n   n = 21\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify the solution**: Substitute \\( n = 21 \\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.\n   \\[\n   87 \\times 21 - 74 = 1753\n   \\]\n   Calculate \\( 87 \\times 21 \\):\n   \\[\n   87 \\times 21 = 1827\n   \\]\n   Then subtract 74:\n   \\[\n   1827 - 74 = 1753\n   \\]\n   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution is verified.\n\nThe value of \\( n \\) is correct.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<21>>>."
