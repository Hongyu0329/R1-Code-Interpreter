    "To solve the equation \\(76 - 68s = -1352\\) for \\(s\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Isolate the term with \\(s\\):**  \n   We start by moving the constant term (76) to the right side of the equation. This is done by subtracting 76 from both sides of the equation.\n\n   \\[\n   76 - 68s - 76 = -1352 - 76\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n\n   \\[\n   -68s = -1428\n   \\]\n\n2. **Solve for \\(s\\):**  \n   Now, we need to isolate \\(s\\) by dividing both sides of the equation by \\(-68\\).\n\n   \\[\n   s = \\frac{-1428}{-68}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the division:**  \n   Calculate the division to find the value of \\(s\\).\n\n   \\[\n   s = \\frac{1428}{68}\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying the fraction:\n\n   - First, find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1428 and 68. The GCD is 4.\n   - Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD.\n\n   \\[\n   s = \\frac{1428 \\div 4}{68 \\div 4} = \\frac{357}{17}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Final calculation:**  \n   Perform the division to get the final value of \\(s\\).\n\n   \\[\n   s = 21\n   \\]\n\nThus, the solution to the equation is:\n\n<<<21>>>"
