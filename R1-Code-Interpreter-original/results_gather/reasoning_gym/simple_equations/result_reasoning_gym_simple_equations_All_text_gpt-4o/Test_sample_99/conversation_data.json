    "To solve the equation \\(37k + 87 = 679\\) for \\(k\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation is a linear equation in the form of \\(ax + b = c\\), where \\(a = 37\\), \\(b = 87\\), and \\(c = 679\\). We need to solve for \\(k\\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Variable Term**: To isolate the term with \\(k\\), subtract 87 from both sides of the equation. This will help us eliminate the constant term on the left side.\n\n   \\[\n   37k + 87 - 87 = 679 - 87\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n\n   \\[\n   37k = 592\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(k\\)**: Now that we have isolated the term with \\(k\\), divide both sides of the equation by 37 to solve for \\(k\\).\n\n   \\[\n   k = \\frac{592}{37}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Perform the Division**: Calculate the division to find the value of \\(k\\).\n\n   \\[\n   k = 16\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**: To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \\(k = 16\\) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.\n\n   \\[\n   37 \\times 16 + 87 = 679\n   \\]\n\n   Calculate the left side:\n\n   \\[\n   592 + 87 = 679\n   \\]\n\n   Since both sides are equal, the solution is verified.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<16>>>"
