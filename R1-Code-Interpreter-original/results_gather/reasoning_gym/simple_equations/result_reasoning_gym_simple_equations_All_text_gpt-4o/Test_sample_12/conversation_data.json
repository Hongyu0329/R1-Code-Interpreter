    "To find the value of \\( n \\) in the equation \\( 175 - 29n = -202 \\), we will solve the equation step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation given is \\( 175 - 29n = -202 \\). Our goal is to isolate \\( n \\) on one side of the equation.\n\n2. **Isolate the Term with \\( n \\)**: \n   - Start by moving the constant term on the left side (175) to the right side of the equation. This can be done by subtracting 175 from both sides.\n   - The equation becomes: \n     \\[\n     175 - 29n - 175 = -202 - 175\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying both sides gives:\n     \\[\n     -29n = -377\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( n \\)**:\n   - Now, we need to solve for \\( n \\) by isolating it. Since \\( n \\) is multiplied by -29, we can divide both sides of the equation by -29 to solve for \\( n \\).\n   - The equation becomes:\n     \\[\n     n = \\frac{-377}{-29}\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying the division:\n     \\[\n     n = 13\n     \\]\n\n4. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - Substitute \\( n = 13 \\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:\n     \\[\n     175 - 29 \\times 13 = 175 - 377 = -202\n     \\]\n   - The left side equals the right side, confirming that \\( n = 13 \\) is indeed the correct solution.\n\nTherefore, the value of \\( n \\) is \\(\\boxed{13}\\).\n\nThe final answer is <<<13>>>."
