    "To find the value of \\( h \\) in the equation \\( 22 - 21h = -1868 \\), we will solve the equation step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the equation**: The equation given is \\( 22 - 21h = -1868 \\). Our goal is to isolate \\( h \\) on one side of the equation.\n\n2. **Isolate the term with \\( h \\)**: \n   - Subtract 22 from both sides of the equation to move the constant term to the right side.\n   \\[\n   22 - 21h - 22 = -1868 - 22\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   -21h = -1890\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( h \\)**:\n   - Divide both sides of the equation by -21 to solve for \\( h \\).\n   \\[\n   h = \\frac{-1890}{-21}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the division:\n   \\[\n   h = 90\n   \\]\n\n4. **Verify the solution**:\n   - Substitute \\( h = 90 \\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.\n   \\[\n   22 - 21 \\times 90 = 22 - 1890 = -1868\n   \\]\n   The left side equals the right side, confirming that \\( h = 90 \\) is correct.\n\nTherefore, the value of \\( h \\) is \\( 90 \\).\n\nThe final answer is: <<<90>>>."
