    "To solve the equation \\(74l + 56 = 4940\\) for \\(l\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation is a linear equation in the form of \\(ax + b = c\\), where \\(a = 74\\), \\(b = 56\\), and \\(c = 4940\\). We need to solve for \\(l\\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Term with \\(l\\)**: \n   - Subtract 56 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \\(l\\).\n   \\[\n   74l + 56 - 56 = 4940 - 56\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   74l = 4884\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(l\\)**:\n   - Divide both sides of the equation by 74 to solve for \\(l\\).\n   \\[\n   l = \\frac{4884}{74}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Perform the Division**:\n   - Calculate \\(\\frac{4884}{74}\\).\n   - Perform the division: 4884 divided by 74 equals 66.\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - Substitute \\(l = 66\\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.\n   \\[\n   74 \\times 66 + 56 = 4940\n   \\]\n   - Calculate \\(74 \\times 66 = 4884\\).\n   - Add 56 to 4884: \\(4884 + 56 = 4940\\).\n   - Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution is verified.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<66>>>"
