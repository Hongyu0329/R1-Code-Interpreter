    "To find the value of \\( w \\) in the equation \\( 24w + 68 = 284 \\), we will solve the equation step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The given equation is \\( 24w + 68 = 284 \\). Our goal is to isolate \\( w \\) on one side of the equation.\n\n2. **Subtract 68 from Both Sides**: To begin isolating \\( w \\), subtract 68 from both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant term on the left side.\n   \\[\n   24w + 68 - 68 = 284 - 68\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   24w = 216\n   \\]\n\n3. **Divide Both Sides by 24**: Now, divide both sides of the equation by 24 to solve for \\( w \\).\n   \\[\n   \\frac{24w}{24} = \\frac{216}{24}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the right side gives:\n   \\[\n   w = 9\n   \\]\n\n4. **Verify the Solution**: To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \\( w = 9 \\) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.\n   \\[\n   24(9) + 68 = 284\n   \\]\n   Calculate the left side:\n   \\[\n   216 + 68 = 284\n   \\]\n   Since both sides are equal, the solution \\( w = 9 \\) is verified.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<9>>>"
