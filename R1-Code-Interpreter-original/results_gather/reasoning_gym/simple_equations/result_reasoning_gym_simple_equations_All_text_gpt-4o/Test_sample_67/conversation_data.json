    "To solve the equation \\(32m + 100 = 3108\\) for \\(m\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation is a linear equation in the form of \\(ax + b = c\\), where \\(a = 32\\), \\(b = 100\\), and \\(c = 3108\\). We need to solve for \\(m\\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Term with \\(m\\)**: \n   - Subtract 100 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \\(m\\).\n   \\[\n   32m + 100 - 100 = 3108 - 100\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   32m = 3008\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(m\\)**:\n   - Divide both sides of the equation by 32 to solve for \\(m\\).\n   \\[\n   m = \\frac{3008}{32}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Perform the Division**:\n   - Calculate \\(\\frac{3008}{32}\\).\n   - Divide 3008 by 32 to find the value of \\(m\\).\n   - Performing the division gives:\n   \\[\n   m = 94\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - Substitute \\(m = 94\\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.\n   \\[\n   32 \\times 94 + 100 = 3108\n   \\]\n   - Calculate \\(32 \\times 94 = 3008\\).\n   - Add 100 to 3008 to get 3108, which matches the right side of the original equation.\n\nThe solution satisfies the original equation, confirming that the value of \\(m\\) is correct.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<94>>>."
