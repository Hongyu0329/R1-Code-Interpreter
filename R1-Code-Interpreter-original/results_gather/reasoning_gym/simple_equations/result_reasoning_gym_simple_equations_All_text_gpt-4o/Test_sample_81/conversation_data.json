    "To determine the value of \\( a \\) that satisfies the equation \\( 31a + 119 = 646 \\), we will solve the equation step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: \n   - The equation given is \\( 31a + 119 = 646 \\).\n   - We need to isolate \\( a \\) on one side of the equation to find its value.\n\n2. **Subtract 119 from Both Sides**:\n   - To isolate the term with \\( a \\), subtract 119 from both sides of the equation.\n   - This gives: \n     \\[\n     31a + 119 - 119 = 646 - 119\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying both sides, we get:\n     \\[\n     31a = 527\n     \\]\n\n3. **Divide Both Sides by 31**:\n   - To solve for \\( a \\), divide both sides of the equation by 31.\n   - This gives:\n     \\[\n     a = \\frac{527}{31}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Division**:\n   - Perform the division to find the value of \\( a \\).\n   - \\( 527 \\div 31 = 17 \\).\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - Substitute \\( a = 17 \\) back into the original equation to verify:\n     \\[\n     31 \\times 17 + 119 = 646\n     \\]\n   - Calculate \\( 31 \\times 17 = 527 \\).\n   - Add 119 to 527: \\( 527 + 119 = 646 \\).\n   - Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution is verified.\n\nThe value of \\( a \\) that satisfies the equation is 17.\n\nFinal answer: <<<17>>>."
