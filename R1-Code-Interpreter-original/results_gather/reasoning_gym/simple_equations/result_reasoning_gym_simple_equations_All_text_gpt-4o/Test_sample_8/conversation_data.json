    "To determine the value of \\( o \\) that satisfies the equation \\( 63 - 17o = -5 \\), we will solve the equation step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation given is \\( 63 - 17o = -5 \\). Our goal is to find the value of \\( o \\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Term with \\( o \\)**: \n   - To isolate the term with \\( o \\), we need to move the constant term (63) to the other side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 63 from both sides of the equation:\n     \\[\n     63 - 17o - 63 = -5 - 63\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying both sides gives:\n     \\[\n     -17o = -68\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( o \\)**:\n   - Now, we need to solve for \\( o \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by -17:\n     \\[\n     o = \\frac{-68}{-17}\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying the right side, we find:\n     \\[\n     o = 4\n     \\]\n\n4. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - Substitute \\( o = 4 \\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:\n     \\[\n     63 - 17 \\times 4 = 63 - 68 = -5\n     \\]\n   - The left side equals the right side, confirming that our solution is correct.\n\nTherefore, the value of \\( o \\) that satisfies the equation is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
