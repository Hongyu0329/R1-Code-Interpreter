    "To find the value of \\( j \\) in the equation \\( 62j + 14 = 386 \\), we will solve the equation step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The given equation is \\( 62j + 14 = 386 \\). Our goal is to isolate \\( j \\) on one side of the equation.\n\n2. **Subtract 14 from Both Sides**: \n   - Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation. \n   - Subtract 14 from both sides to maintain the equality.\n   \\[\n   62j + 14 - 14 = 386 - 14\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   62j = 372\n   \\]\n\n3. **Divide Both Sides by 62**: \n   - Now, to solve for \\( j \\), divide both sides of the equation by 62.\n   \\[\n   \\frac{62j}{62} = \\frac{372}{62}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the left side gives:\n   \\[\n   j = \\frac{372}{62}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Division**: \n   - Perform the division to find the value of \\( j \\).\n   \\[\n   j = 6\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**: \n   - Substitute \\( j = 6 \\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.\n   \\[\n   62 \\times 6 + 14 = 386\n   \\]\n   Calculate the left side:\n   \\[\n   372 + 14 = 386\n   \\]\n   Since both sides are equal, the solution is verified.\n\nThe value of \\( j \\) is \\( 6 \\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<6>>>"
