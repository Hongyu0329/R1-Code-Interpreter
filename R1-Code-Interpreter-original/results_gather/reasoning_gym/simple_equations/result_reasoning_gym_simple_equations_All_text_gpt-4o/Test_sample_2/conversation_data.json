    "To solve the equation \\(1500q + 120 = 82620\\) for \\(q\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation is a linear equation in the form of \\(ax + b = c\\), where \\(a = 1500\\), \\(b = 120\\), and \\(c = 82620\\). We need to solve for \\(q\\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Term with \\(q\\)**: \n   - Subtract 120 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \\(q\\).\n   \\[\n   1500q + 120 - 120 = 82620 - 120\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   1500q = 82500\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(q\\)**:\n   - Divide both sides of the equation by 1500 to solve for \\(q\\).\n   \\[\n   q = \\frac{82500}{1500}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the Division**:\n   - Perform the division to find the value of \\(q\\).\n   \\[\n   q = 55\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - Substitute \\(q = 55\\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.\n   \\[\n   1500 \\times 55 + 120 = 82620\n   \\]\n   - Calculate \\(1500 \\times 55 = 82500\\).\n   - Add 120 to 82500 to get 82620, which matches the right side of the original equation.\n\nSince the solution satisfies the original equation, the value of \\(q\\) is correct.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<55>>>"
