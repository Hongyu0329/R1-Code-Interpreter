    "To solve the equation \\(60i + 62 = 662\\) for \\(i\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation is a linear equation in the form of \\(ax + b = c\\), where \\(a = 60\\), \\(b = 62\\), and \\(c = 662\\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Variable Term**: We need to isolate the term containing the variable \\(i\\) on one side of the equation. To do this, subtract 62 from both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   60i + 62 - 62 = 662 - 62\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   60i = 600\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for the Variable**: Now, divide both sides of the equation by 60 to solve for \\(i\\):\n   \\[\n   i = \\frac{600}{60}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the Division**: Perform the division to find the value of \\(i\\):\n   \\[\n   i = 10\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**: Substitute \\(i = 10\\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:\n   \\[\n   60(10) + 62 = 600 + 62 = 662\n   \\]\n   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution is verified.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<10>>>"
