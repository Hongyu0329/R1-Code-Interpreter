    "To solve the equation \\( 7410x + 7254 = 274014 \\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation is a linear equation in the form \\( ax + b = c \\), where \\( a = 7410 \\), \\( b = 7254 \\), and \\( c = 274014 \\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Variable Term**: To solve for \\( x \\), we need to isolate the term containing \\( x \\). We do this by subtracting 7254 from both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   7410x + 7254 - 7254 = 274014 - 7254\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both sides, we get:\n   \\[\n   7410x = 266760\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( x \\)**: Now that we have isolated the term with \\( x \\), we divide both sides by 7410 to solve for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{266760}{7410}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Perform the Division**: Calculate the division to find the value of \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x = 36\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**: To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \\( x = 36 \\) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal:\n   \\[\n   7410 \\times 36 + 7254 = 274014\n   \\]\n   Calculate the left side:\n   \\[\n   266760 + 7254 = 274014\n   \\]\n   Since both sides are equal, the solution is verified.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<36>>>"
