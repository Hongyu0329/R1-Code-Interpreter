    "To determine the value of \\( g \\) that satisfies the equation \\( 39 - 96g = -441 \\), we will solve the equation step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the equation**: The equation given is \\( 39 - 96g = -441 \\). Our goal is to isolate \\( g \\) on one side of the equation.\n\n2. **Move the constant term to the other side**: \n   - We start by subtracting 39 from both sides of the equation to move the constant term to the right side.\n   - This gives us: \n     \\[\n     39 - 96g - 39 = -441 - 39\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying both sides, we get:\n     \\[\n     -96g = -480\n     \\]\n\n3. **Isolate \\( g \\)**:\n   - To isolate \\( g \\), we need to divide both sides of the equation by -96.\n   - This gives us:\n     \\[\n     g = \\frac{-480}{-96}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the division**:\n   - Calculate the division:\n     \\[\n     g = \\frac{-480}{-96} = 5\n     \\]\n\n5. **Verify the solution**:\n   - Substitute \\( g = 5 \\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:\n     \\[\n     39 - 96 \\times 5 = 39 - 480 = -441\n     \\]\n   - The left side equals the right side, confirming that \\( g = 5 \\) is indeed the correct solution.\n\nTherefore, the value of \\( g \\) that satisfies the equation is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
