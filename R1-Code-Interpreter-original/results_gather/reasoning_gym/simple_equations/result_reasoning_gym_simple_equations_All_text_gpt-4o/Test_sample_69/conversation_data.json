    "To solve the equation \\(70 - 7s = -126\\), we need to determine the value of \\(s\\) that satisfies this equation. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation given is \\(70 - 7s = -126\\). This is a linear equation in one variable, \\(s\\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Term with \\(s\\)**: To solve for \\(s\\), we need to isolate the term that contains \\(s\\). We can do this by moving the constant term (70) to the other side of the equation. We achieve this by subtracting 70 from both sides:\n\n   \\[\n   70 - 7s - 70 = -126 - 70\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n\n   \\[\n   -7s = -196\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(s\\)**: Now, we need to solve for \\(s\\) by isolating it. Since \\(-7s\\) means \\(-7\\) times \\(s\\), we can divide both sides of the equation by \\(-7\\) to solve for \\(s\\):\n\n   \\[\n   s = \\frac{-196}{-7}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the Division**: Perform the division to find the value of \\(s\\):\n\n   \\[\n   s = 28\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**: To ensure our solution is correct, we can substitute \\(s = 28\\) back into the original equation to check:\n\n   \\[\n   70 - 7 \\times 28 = 70 - 196 = -126\n   \\]\n\n   The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming that our solution is correct.\n\nTherefore, the value of \\(s\\) that satisfies the equation is:\n\n<<<28>>>"
