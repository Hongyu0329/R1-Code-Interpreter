    "To determine the value of \\( m \\) that satisfies the equation \\( 82m - 113 = 3249 \\), we will solve the equation step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The given equation is \\( 82m - 113 = 3249 \\). Our goal is to solve for \\( m \\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Term with \\( m \\)**: \n   - To isolate the term with \\( m \\), we need to eliminate the constant term on the left side of the equation. We do this by adding 113 to both sides of the equation:\n     \\[\n     82m - 113 + 113 = 3249 + 113\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying both sides, we get:\n     \\[\n     82m = 3362\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( m \\)**:\n   - Now, we need to solve for \\( m \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 82:\n     \\[\n     m = \\frac{3362}{82}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Perform the Division**:\n   - Calculate \\( \\frac{3362}{82} \\):\n     - First, check if 3362 is divisible by 82. Perform the division:\n     - \\( 3362 \\div 82 = 41 \\)\n   - Therefore, \\( m = 41 \\).\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - Substitute \\( m = 41 \\) back into the original equation to verify:\n     \\[\n     82 \\times 41 - 113 = 3249\n     \\]\n   - Calculate \\( 82 \\times 41 \\):\n     - \\( 82 \\times 41 = 3362 \\)\n   - Subtract 113 from 3362:\n     - \\( 3362 - 113 = 3249 \\)\n   - The left side equals the right side, confirming that our solution is correct.\n\nThe value of \\( m \\) that satisfies the equation is 41.\n\nFinal answer: <<<41>>>"
