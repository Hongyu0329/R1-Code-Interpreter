    "To solve the equation \\(59 - 92t = -8589\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Isolate the term with the variable**: \n   - We want to isolate the term with \\(t\\) on one side of the equation. To do this, subtract 59 from both sides of the equation:\n     \\[\n     59 - 92t - 59 = -8589 - 59\n     \\]\n     Simplifying both sides gives:\n     \\[\n     -92t = -8648\n     \\]\n\n2. **Solve for \\(t\\)**:\n   - Now, we need to solve for \\(t\\) by dividing both sides of the equation by \\(-92\\):\n     \\[\n     t = \\frac{-8648}{-92}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the division**:\n   - Calculate the division:\n     \\[\n     t = 94\n     \\]\n\n4. **Verify the solution**:\n   - Substitute \\(t = 94\\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:\n     \\[\n     59 - 92 \\times 94 = -8589\n     \\]\n     Calculate \\(92 \\times 94\\):\n     \\[\n     92 \\times 94 = 8648\n     \\]\n     Then:\n     \\[\n     59 - 8648 = -8589\n     \\]\n     Simplifying the left side:\n     \\[\n     -8589 = -8589\n     \\]\n   - The left side equals the right side, confirming that \\(t = 94\\) is indeed the correct solution.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the equation is:\n\n<<<94>>>"
