    "To solve the equation \\(264h + 18 = 18498\\) for \\(h\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Isolate the term with \\(h\\):**  \n   We need to get the term with \\(h\\) by itself on one side of the equation. To do this, subtract 18 from both sides of the equation.\n\n   \\[\n   264h + 18 - 18 = 18498 - 18\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n\n   \\[\n   264h = 18480\n   \\]\n\n2. **Solve for \\(h\\):**  \n   Now, we need to solve for \\(h\\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 264.\n\n   \\[\n   h = \\frac{18480}{264}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Perform the division:**  \n   Calculate the division to find the value of \\(h\\).\n\n   \\[\n   h = 70\n   \\]\n\n4. **Verify the solution:**  \n   To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \\(h = 70\\) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.\n\n   \\[\n   264 \\times 70 + 18 = 18498\n   \\]\n\n   Calculate the left side:\n\n   \\[\n   264 \\times 70 = 18480\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   18480 + 18 = 18498\n   \\]\n\n   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution is verified.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<70>>>"
