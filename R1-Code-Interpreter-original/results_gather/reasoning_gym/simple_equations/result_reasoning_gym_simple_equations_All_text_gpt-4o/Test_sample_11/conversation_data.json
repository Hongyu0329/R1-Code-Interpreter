    "To determine the value of \\( b \\) that satisfies the equation \\( 71 - 48b = -2761 \\), we will solve the equation step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the equation**: The equation given is \\( 71 - 48b = -2761 \\). We need to isolate \\( b \\) on one side of the equation to find its value.\n\n2. **Isolate the term with \\( b \\)**: \n   - Start by moving the constant term (71) to the other side of the equation. This can be done by subtracting 71 from both sides:\n     \\[\n     71 - 48b - 71 = -2761 - 71\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying both sides gives:\n     \\[\n     -48b = -2832\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( b \\)**:\n   - To isolate \\( b \\), divide both sides of the equation by -48:\n     \\[\n     b = \\frac{-2832}{-48}\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying the division:\n     \\[\n     b = \\frac{2832}{48}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the fraction**:\n   - Calculate the division:\n     \\[\n     b = 59\n     \\]\n\n5. **Verify the solution**:\n   - Substitute \\( b = 59 \\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:\n     \\[\n     71 - 48 \\times 59 = 71 - 2832 = -2761\n     \\]\n   - The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming that \\( b = 59 \\) is correct.\n\nThe value of \\( b \\) that satisfies the equation is \\( 59 \\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<59>>>"
