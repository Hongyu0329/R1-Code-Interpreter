    "To find the value of \\( q \\) in the equation \\( 12q + 25 = 361 \\), we will solve the equation step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The given equation is \\( 12q + 25 = 361 \\). Our goal is to isolate \\( q \\) on one side of the equation.\n\n2. **Subtract 25 from Both Sides**: To begin isolating \\( q \\), subtract 25 from both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant term on the left side.\n   \\[\n   12q + 25 - 25 = 361 - 25\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   12q = 336\n   \\]\n\n3. **Divide Both Sides by 12**: Now, divide both sides of the equation by 12 to solve for \\( q \\).\n   \\[\n   \\frac{12q}{12} = \\frac{336}{12}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   q = 28\n   \\]\n\n4. **Verify the Solution**: To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \\( q = 28 \\) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.\n   \\[\n   12 \\times 28 + 25 = 361\n   \\]\n   Calculate \\( 12 \\times 28 \\):\n   \\[\n   12 \\times 28 = 336\n   \\]\n   Add 25 to 336:\n   \\[\n   336 + 25 = 361\n   \\]\n   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution \\( q = 28 \\) is verified.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<28>>>"
