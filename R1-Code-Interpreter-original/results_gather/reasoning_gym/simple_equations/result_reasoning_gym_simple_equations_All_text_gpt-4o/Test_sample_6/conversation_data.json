    "To determine the value of \\( u \\) that satisfies the equation \\( 9u + 4 = 58 \\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \\( u \\). The goal is to isolate \\( u \\) on one side of the equation to find its value.\n\n2. **Subtract 4 from Both Sides**: \n   - Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation. \n   - Subtract 4 from both sides of the equation to maintain equality:\n     \\[\n     9u + 4 - 4 = 58 - 4\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying both sides gives:\n     \\[\n     9u = 54\n     \\]\n\n3. **Divide Both Sides by 9**:\n   - Now, divide both sides of the equation by 9 to solve for \\( u \\):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{9u}{9} = \\frac{54}{9}\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying both sides gives:\n     \\[\n     u = 6\n     \\]\n\n4. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - Substitute \\( u = 6 \\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:\n     \\[\n     9(6) + 4 = 54 + 4 = 58\n     \\]\n   - Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution is verified.\n\nThe value of \\( u \\) that satisfies the equation is \\( 6 \\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<6>>>."
