    "To solve the equation \\(54c + 99 = 4257\\) for \\(c\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation is a linear equation in the form of \\(ax + b = c\\), where \\(a = 54\\), \\(b = 99\\), and the result is 4257. We need to isolate \\(c\\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Term with \\(c\\)**: \n   - Subtract 99 from both sides of the equation to get rid of the constant term on the left side.\n   \\[\n   54c + 99 - 99 = 4257 - 99\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   54c = 4158\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(c\\)**:\n   - Divide both sides of the equation by 54 to solve for \\(c\\).\n   \\[\n   c = \\frac{4158}{54}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Perform the Division**:\n   - Calculate \\(\\frac{4158}{54}\\).\n   - Perform the division: 4158 divided by 54 equals 77.\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - Substitute \\(c = 77\\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.\n   \\[\n   54 \\times 77 + 99 = 4158 + 99 = 4257\n   \\]\n   The left side equals the right side, confirming that the solution is correct.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{77}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the solution to the equation is:\n<<<77>>>"
