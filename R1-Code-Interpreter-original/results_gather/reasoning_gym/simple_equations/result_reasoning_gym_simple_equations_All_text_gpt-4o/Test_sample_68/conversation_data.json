    "To determine the value of \\( e \\) that satisfies the equation \\(-51e - 40 = -805\\), we can solve the equation step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: \n   The equation given is \\(-51e - 40 = -805\\). Our goal is to isolate \\( e \\) on one side of the equation.\n\n2. **Add 40 to Both Sides**:\n   To eliminate the \\(-40\\) on the left side, add 40 to both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   -51e - 40 + 40 = -805 + 40\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   -51e = -765\n   \\]\n\n3. **Divide Both Sides by -51**:\n   To solve for \\( e \\), divide both sides of the equation by \\(-51\\):\n   \\[\n   e = \\frac{-765}{-51}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the Division**:\n   Calculate the division:\n   \\[\n   e = \\frac{-765}{-51} = 15\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**:\n   Substitute \\( e = 15 \\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:\n   \\[\n   -51(15) - 40 = -805\n   \\]\n   Calculate \\(-51 \\times 15\\):\n   \\[\n   -765 - 40 = -805\n   \\]\n   \\(-805 = -805\\), which confirms that the solution is correct.\n\nThe value of \\( e \\) that satisfies the equation is 15.\n\nFinal answer: <<<15>>>."
