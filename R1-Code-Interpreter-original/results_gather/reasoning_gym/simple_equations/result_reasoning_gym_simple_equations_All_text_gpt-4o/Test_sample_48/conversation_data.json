    "To solve the equation \\(124 - 47i = -3213\\) for \\(i\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation is a linear equation in the form of \\(ax + b = c\\), where \\(a = -47\\), \\(b = 124\\), and \\(c = -3213\\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Term with \\(i\\)**: We need to isolate the term that contains \\(i\\). To do this, subtract 124 from both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   124 - 47i - 124 = -3213 - 124\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   -47i = -3337\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(i\\)**: Now, divide both sides of the equation by -47 to solve for \\(i\\):\n   \\[\n   i = \\frac{-3337}{-47}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Division**: Perform the division to find the value of \\(i\\):\n   \\[\n   i = 71\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**: Substitute \\(i = 71\\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:\n   \\[\n   124 - 47 \\times 71 = 124 - 3337 = -3213\n   \\]\n   The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming that the solution is correct.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<71>>>"
