    "To solve the equation \\(44i + 52 = 712\\) for \\(i\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation is a linear equation in the form of \\(ax + b = c\\), where \\(a = 44\\), \\(b = 52\\), and \\(c = 712\\). We need to solve for \\(i\\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Term with \\(i\\)**: \n   - Subtract 52 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \\(i\\).\n   \\[\n   44i + 52 - 52 = 712 - 52\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   44i = 660\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(i\\)**:\n   - Divide both sides of the equation by 44 to solve for \\(i\\).\n   \\[\n   i = \\frac{660}{44}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the Division**:\n   - Perform the division to find the value of \\(i\\).\n   \\[\n   i = 15\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - Substitute \\(i = 15\\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.\n   \\[\n   44 \\times 15 + 52 = 660 + 52 = 712\n   \\]\n   The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming that \\(i = 15\\) is correct.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<15>>>"
