    "To find the value of \\( h \\) in the equation \\( 1062 \\times h = 97704 \\), we need to solve for \\( h \\). Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation given is \\( 1062 \\times h = 97704 \\). This is a simple linear equation where \\( h \\) is multiplied by 1062 to give 97704.\n\n2. **Isolate the Variable**: To find the value of \\( h \\), we need to isolate \\( h \\) on one side of the equation. This can be done by dividing both sides of the equation by 1062.\n\n3. **Perform the Division**: \n   \\[\n   h = \\frac{97704}{1062}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Division**: Perform the division to find the value of \\( h \\).\n   - Divide 97704 by 1062.\n   - This can be done using long division or a calculator.\n\n5. **Verify the Calculation**: After performing the division, it is always a good practice to verify the result by multiplying the obtained value of \\( h \\) by 1062 to check if it equals 97704.\n\n6. **Conclude the Result**: Once verified, the value obtained is the solution to the equation.\n\nBy performing the division, we find:\n\\[\nh = 92\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the value of \\( h \\) is 92.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<92>>>"
