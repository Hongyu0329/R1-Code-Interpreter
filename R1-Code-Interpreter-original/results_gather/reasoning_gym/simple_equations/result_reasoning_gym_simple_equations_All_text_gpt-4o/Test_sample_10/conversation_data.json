    "To find the value of \\( u \\) in the equation \\( 32u + 4 = 3044 \\), we will solve the equation step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The given equation is \\( 32u + 4 = 3044 \\). Our goal is to isolate \\( u \\) on one side of the equation.\n\n2. **Subtract 4 from Both Sides**: To begin isolating \\( u \\), subtract 4 from both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant term on the left side.\n   \\[\n   32u + 4 - 4 = 3044 - 4\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   32u = 3040\n   \\]\n\n3. **Divide Both Sides by 32**: Now, divide both sides of the equation by 32 to solve for \\( u \\).\n   \\[\n   \\frac{32u}{32} = \\frac{3040}{32}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the left side gives:\n   \\[\n   u = \\frac{3040}{32}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Division**: Perform the division to find the value of \\( u \\).\n   \\[\n   u = 95\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**: To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \\( u = 95 \\) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.\n   \\[\n   32 \\times 95 + 4 = 3044\n   \\]\n   Calculate the left side:\n   \\[\n   3040 + 4 = 3044\n   \\]\n   Since both sides are equal, the solution is verified.\n\nThe value of \\( u \\) is \\( 95 \\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<95>>>"
