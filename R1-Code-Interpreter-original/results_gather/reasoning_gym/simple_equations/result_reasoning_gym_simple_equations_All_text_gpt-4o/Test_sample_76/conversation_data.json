    "To determine the value of \\( e \\) that satisfies the equation \\( 49e + 190 = 1464 \\), we will solve the equation step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: \n   - We have the equation \\( 49e + 190 = 1464 \\).\n   - Our goal is to isolate \\( e \\) on one side of the equation.\n\n2. **Isolate the Term with \\( e \\)**:\n   - Subtract 190 from both sides of the equation to remove the constant term on the left side.\n   - This gives us: \n     \\[\n     49e + 190 - 190 = 1464 - 190\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying both sides, we get:\n     \\[\n     49e = 1274\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( e \\)**:\n   - Now, divide both sides of the equation by 49 to solve for \\( e \\).\n   - This gives us:\n     \\[\n     e = \\frac{1274}{49}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Division**:\n   - Perform the division \\( 1274 \\div 49 \\).\n   - Calculate the quotient:\n     - 49 goes into 127 two times (since \\( 49 \\times 2 = 98 \\)).\n     - Subtract 98 from 127 to get 29.\n     - Bring down the next digit (4) to make it 294.\n     - 49 goes into 294 six times (since \\( 49 \\times 6 = 294 \\)).\n     - Subtract 294 from 294 to get 0.\n   - Therefore, \\( 1274 \\div 49 = 26 \\).\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - Substitute \\( e = 26 \\) back into the original equation to verify:\n     \\[\n     49 \\times 26 + 190 = 1464\n     \\]\n   - Calculate \\( 49 \\times 26 = 1274 \\).\n   - Add 190 to 1274 to get 1464, which matches the right side of the original equation.\n\nThus, the value of \\( e \\) that satisfies the equation is 26.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<26>>>."
