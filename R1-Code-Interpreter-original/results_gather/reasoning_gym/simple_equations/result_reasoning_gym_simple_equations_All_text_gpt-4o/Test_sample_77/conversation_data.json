    "To solve the equation \\(13i + 58 = 890\\) for \\(i\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation is a linear equation in the form of \\(ax + b = c\\), where \\(a = 13\\), \\(b = 58\\), and \\(c = 890\\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Variable**: We need to solve for \\(i\\), which means we need to isolate \\(i\\) on one side of the equation.\n\n3. **Subtract 58 from Both Sides**: To begin isolating \\(i\\), subtract 58 from both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant term on the left side.\n   \\[\n   13i + 58 - 58 = 890 - 58\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   13i = 832\n   \\]\n\n4. **Divide by 13**: Now, divide both sides of the equation by 13 to solve for \\(i\\).\n   \\[\n   i = \\frac{832}{13}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the Division**: Perform the division to find the value of \\(i\\).\n   \\[\n   i = 64\n   \\]\n\n6. **Verify the Solution**: To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \\(i = 64\\) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.\n   \\[\n   13 \\times 64 + 58 = 832 + 58 = 890\n   \\]\n   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution is verified.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<64>>>"
