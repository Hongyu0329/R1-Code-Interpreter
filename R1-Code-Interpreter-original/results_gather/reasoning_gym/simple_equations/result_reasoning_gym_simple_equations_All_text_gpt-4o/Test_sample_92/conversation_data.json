    "To find the value of \\( i \\) in the equation \\( 2538i + 1296 = 138348 \\), we will solve the equation step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: \n   - The equation given is \\( 2538i + 1296 = 138348 \\).\n   - We need to isolate \\( i \\) on one side of the equation to find its value.\n\n2. **Subtract 1296 from Both Sides**:\n   - To isolate the term with \\( i \\), subtract 1296 from both sides of the equation.\n   - This gives us: \n     \\[\n     2538i + 1296 - 1296 = 138348 - 1296\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying both sides, we get:\n     \\[\n     2538i = 137052\n     \\]\n\n3. **Divide Both Sides by 2538**:\n   - To solve for \\( i \\), divide both sides of the equation by 2538.\n   - This gives us:\n     \\[\n     i = \\frac{137052}{2538}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Division**:\n   - Perform the division to find the value of \\( i \\).\n   - Calculate \\( \\frac{137052}{2538} \\).\n\n5. **Simplify the Result**:\n   - The division results in:\n     \\[\n     i = 54\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the value of \\( i \\) is 54.\n\nFinal answer: <<<54>>>."
