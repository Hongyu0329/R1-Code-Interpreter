    "To determine the value of \\( g \\) that satisfies the equation \\( 51g + 21 = 1704 \\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation given is a linear equation in the form of \\( ax + b = c \\), where \\( a = 51 \\), \\( b = 21 \\), and \\( c = 1704 \\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Variable**: We need to solve for \\( g \\). To do this, we first isolate the term containing \\( g \\) on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 21 from both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   51g + 21 - 21 = 1704 - 21\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   51g = 1683\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( g \\)**: Now that we have \\( 51g = 1683 \\), we can solve for \\( g \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 51:\n   \\[\n   g = \\frac{1683}{51}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Perform the Division**: Calculate the division to find the value of \\( g \\):\n   \\[\n   g = 33\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**: To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \\( g = 33 \\) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal:\n   \\[\n   51 \\times 33 + 21 = 1704\n   \\]\n   Calculate \\( 51 \\times 33 \\):\n   \\[\n   51 \\times 33 = 1683\n   \\]\n   Add 21 to 1683:\n   \\[\n   1683 + 21 = 1704\n   \\]\n   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution is verified.\n\nThe value of \\( g \\) that satisfies the equation is \\( 33 \\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<33>>>."
