    "To solve the equation \\(1404l + 39 = 136227\\) for \\(l\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation is a linear equation in the form of \\(ax + b = c\\), where \\(a = 1404\\), \\(b = 39\\), and \\(c = 136227\\). We need to solve for \\(l\\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Term with \\(l\\)**: To isolate the term with \\(l\\), subtract 39 from both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   1404l + 39 - 39 = 136227 - 39\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   1404l = 136188\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(l\\)**: Now, divide both sides of the equation by 1404 to solve for \\(l\\):\n   \\[\n   l = \\frac{136188}{1404}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Perform the Division**: Calculate the division to find the value of \\(l\\):\n   \\[\n   l = 97\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**: To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \\(l = 97\\) back into the original equation and check:\n   \\[\n   1404 \\times 97 + 39 = 136227\n   \\]\n   Calculate \\(1404 \\times 97\\):\n   \\[\n   1404 \\times 97 = 136188\n   \\]\n   Add 39 to the result:\n   \\[\n   136188 + 39 = 136227\n   \\]\n   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution is verified.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<97>>>"
