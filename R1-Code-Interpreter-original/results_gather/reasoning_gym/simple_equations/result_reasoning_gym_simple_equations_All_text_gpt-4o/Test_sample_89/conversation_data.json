    "To solve the equation \\(79c - 51 = 1766\\) for \\(c\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation is a linear equation in the form of \\(ax + b = c\\), where \\(a = 79\\), \\(b = -51\\), and the right side is 1766.\n\n2. **Isolate the Term with the Variable**: We need to isolate the term that contains the variable \\(c\\). To do this, we will first eliminate the constant term on the left side of the equation by adding 51 to both sides.\n\n   \\[\n   79c - 51 + 51 = 1766 + 51\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying both sides, we get:\n\n   \\[\n   79c = 1817\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for the Variable**: Now that we have isolated the term with the variable, we need to solve for \\(c\\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 79.\n\n   \\[\n   c = \\frac{1817}{79}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Perform the Division**: Calculate the division to find the value of \\(c\\).\n\n   \\[\n   c = 23\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**: To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \\(c = 23\\) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.\n\n   \\[\n   79 \\times 23 - 51 = 1766\n   \\]\n\n   Calculate the left side:\n\n   \\[\n   79 \\times 23 = 1817\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   1817 - 51 = 1766\n   \\]\n\n   Since both sides are equal, the solution is verified.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<23>>>"
