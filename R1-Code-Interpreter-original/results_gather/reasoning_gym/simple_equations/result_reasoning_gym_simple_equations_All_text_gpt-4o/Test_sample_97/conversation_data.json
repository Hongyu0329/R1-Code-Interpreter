    "To find the value of \\( s \\) in the equation \\( 1505s + 37 = 30137 \\), we need to solve for \\( s \\) step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The given equation is \\( 1505s + 37 = 30137 \\). Our goal is to isolate \\( s \\).\n\n2. **Subtract 37 from Both Sides**: \n   - Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation. \n   - Subtract 37 from both sides to maintain equality:\n     \\[\n     1505s + 37 - 37 = 30137 - 37\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying both sides gives:\n     \\[\n     1505s = 30100\n     \\]\n\n3. **Divide Both Sides by 1505**:\n   - To solve for \\( s \\), divide both sides of the equation by 1505:\n     \\[\n     s = \\frac{30100}{1505}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Perform the Division**:\n   - Calculate the division:\n     \\[\n     s = 20\n     \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - Substitute \\( s = 20 \\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:\n     \\[\n     1505 \\times 20 + 37 = 30100 + 37 = 30137\n     \\]\n   - The left side equals the right side, confirming that \\( s = 20 \\) is correct.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<20>>>"
