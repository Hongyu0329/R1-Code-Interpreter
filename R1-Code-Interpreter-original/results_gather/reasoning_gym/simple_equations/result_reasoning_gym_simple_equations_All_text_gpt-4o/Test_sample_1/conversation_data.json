    "To determine the value of \\( s \\) that satisfies the equation \\( 81 - 62s = -4197 \\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation given is \\( 81 - 62s = -4197 \\). Our goal is to solve for \\( s \\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Term with \\( s \\)**: To isolate the term with \\( s \\), we need to move the constant term (81) to the other side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 81 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   81 - 62s - 81 = -4197 - 81\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   -62s = -4278\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( s \\)**: Now, we need to solve for \\( s \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by -62:\n   \\[\n   s = \\frac{-4278}{-62}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Division**: Perform the division to find the value of \\( s \\):\n   \\[\n   s = \\frac{4278}{62}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Simplify the Division**: Calculate the division:\n   \\[\n   s = 69\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of \\( s \\) that satisfies the equation is 69.\n\nFinal answer: <<<69>>>"
