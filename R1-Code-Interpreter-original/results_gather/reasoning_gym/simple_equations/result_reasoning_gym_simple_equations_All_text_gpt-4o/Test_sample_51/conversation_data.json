    "To solve the equation \\(119p + 49 = 2786\\) for \\(p\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation is a linear equation in the form of \\(ax + b = c\\), where \\(a = 119\\), \\(b = 49\\), and \\(c = 2786\\). We need to solve for \\(p\\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Term with \\(p\\)**: \n   - Subtract 49 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \\(p\\).\n   \\[\n   119p + 49 - 49 = 2786 - 49\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   119p = 2737\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(p\\)**:\n   - Divide both sides of the equation by 119 to solve for \\(p\\).\n   \\[\n   p = \\frac{2737}{119}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Perform the Division**:\n   - Calculate \\(\\frac{2737}{119}\\).\n   - Perform the division: 2737 divided by 119 equals 23.\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - Substitute \\(p = 23\\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.\n   \\[\n   119 \\times 23 + 49 = 2786\n   \\]\n   - Calculate \\(119 \\times 23 = 2737\\).\n   - Add 49 to 2737, which gives 2786, confirming the solution is correct.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{23}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the solution to the equation is:\n<<<23>>>"
