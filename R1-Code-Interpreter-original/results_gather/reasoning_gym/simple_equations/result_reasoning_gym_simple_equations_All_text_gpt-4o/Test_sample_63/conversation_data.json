    "To find the value of \\( y \\) in the equation \\( 4y + 231 = 375 \\), we will solve the equation step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: \n   - The given equation is \\( 4y + 231 = 375 \\).\n   - Our goal is to isolate \\( y \\) on one side of the equation.\n\n2. **Subtract 231 from Both Sides**:\n   - To isolate the term with \\( y \\), subtract 231 from both sides of the equation.\n   - This gives: \n     \\[\n     4y + 231 - 231 = 375 - 231\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying both sides, we get:\n     \\[\n     4y = 144\n     \\]\n\n3. **Divide Both Sides by 4**:\n   - To solve for \\( y \\), divide both sides of the equation by 4.\n   - This gives:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{4y}{4} = \\frac{144}{4}\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying both sides, we find:\n     \\[\n     y = 36\n     \\]\n\n4. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - Substitute \\( y = 36 \\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.\n   - Original equation: \\( 4y + 231 = 375 \\).\n   - Substitute \\( y = 36 \\):\n     \\[\n     4(36) + 231 = 144 + 231 = 375\n     \\]\n   - Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution is verified.\n\nThe value of \\( y \\) is \\( 36 \\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<36>>>."
