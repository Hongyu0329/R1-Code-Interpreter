    "To find the value of \\( r \\) in the equation \\( 1920r + 9312 = 149472 \\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation is a linear equation in the form \\( ax + b = c \\), where \\( a = 1920 \\), \\( b = 9312 \\), and \\( c = 149472 \\). We need to solve for \\( r \\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Term with \\( r \\)**: To isolate the term with \\( r \\), subtract 9312 from both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   1920r + 9312 - 9312 = 149472 - 9312\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   1920r = 140160\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( r \\)**: Now, divide both sides of the equation by 1920 to solve for \\( r \\):\n   \\[\n   r = \\frac{140160}{1920}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Perform the Division**: Calculate the division:\n   \\[\n   r = 73\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**: To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \\( r = 73 \\) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal:\n   \\[\n   1920 \\times 73 + 9312 = 149472\n   \\]\n   Calculate \\( 1920 \\times 73 \\):\n   \\[\n   1920 \\times 73 = 140160\n   \\]\n   Add 9312 to 140160:\n   \\[\n   140160 + 9312 = 149472\n   \\]\n   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution is verified.\n\nThe value of \\( r \\) is correct.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<73>>>"
