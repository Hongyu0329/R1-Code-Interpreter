    "To determine the value of \\( c \\) that satisfies the equation \\(-40c - 19 = -3619\\), we can solve the equation step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: \n   - We have the equation \\(-40c - 19 = -3619\\).\n   - Our goal is to isolate \\( c \\) on one side of the equation.\n\n2. **Isolate the Term with \\( c \\)**:\n   - Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation. \n   - Add 19 to both sides of the equation to cancel out the \\(-19\\).\n\n   \\[\n   -40c - 19 + 19 = -3619 + 19\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n\n   \\[\n   -40c = -3600\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( c \\)**:\n   - Now, divide both sides of the equation by \\(-40\\) to solve for \\( c \\).\n\n   \\[\n   c = \\frac{-3600}{-40}\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying the division:\n\n   \\[\n   c = 90\n   \\]\n\n4. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - Substitute \\( c = 90 \\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.\n\n   \\[\n   -40(90) - 19 = -3619\n   \\]\n\n   Calculate the left side:\n\n   \\[\n   -3600 - 19 = -3619\n   \\]\n\n   The left side equals the right side, confirming that our solution is correct.\n\nThe value of \\( c \\) that satisfies the equation is:\n\n<<<90>>>"
