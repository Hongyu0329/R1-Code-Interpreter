    "To solve the equation \\( 5056g - 51 = 454989 \\) for \\( g \\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation is a linear equation in the form \\( ax + b = c \\), where \\( a = 5056 \\), \\( b = -51 \\), and \\( c = 454989 \\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Term with \\( g \\)**: \n   - Add 51 to both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant term on the left side.\n   \\[\n   5056g - 51 + 51 = 454989 + 51\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   5056g = 455040\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( g \\)**:\n   - Divide both sides of the equation by 5056 to solve for \\( g \\).\n   \\[\n   g = \\frac{455040}{5056}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Perform the Division**:\n   - Calculate the division to find the value of \\( g \\).\n   \\[\n   g = 90\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - Substitute \\( g = 90 \\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.\n   \\[\n   5056 \\times 90 - 51 = 454989\n   \\]\n   - Calculate \\( 5056 \\times 90 = 455040 \\).\n   - Subtract 51 from 455040 to get 454989, which matches the right side of the original equation.\n\nSince the solution satisfies the original equation, the value of \\( g \\) is correct.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<90>>>."
