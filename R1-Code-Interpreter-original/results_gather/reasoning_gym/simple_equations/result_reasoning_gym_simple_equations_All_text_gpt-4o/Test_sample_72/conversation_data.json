    "To find the value of \\( a \\) in the equation \\( 51a + 99 = 4791 \\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation given is \\( 51a + 99 = 4791 \\). We need to solve for \\( a \\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Term with \\( a \\)**: To isolate the term with \\( a \\), subtract 99 from both sides of the equation. This will help in simplifying the equation:\n   \\[\n   51a + 99 - 99 = 4791 - 99\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   51a = 4692\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( a \\)**: Now, divide both sides of the equation by 51 to solve for \\( a \\):\n   \\[\n   a = \\frac{4692}{51}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Perform the Division**: Calculate the division to find the value of \\( a \\):\n   \\[\n   a = 92\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**: To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \\( a = 92 \\) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal:\n   \\[\n   51 \\times 92 + 99 = 4692 + 99 = 4791\n   \\]\n   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution is verified.\n\nThe value of \\( a \\) is \\( 92 \\).\n\nFinal answer: <<<92>>>"
