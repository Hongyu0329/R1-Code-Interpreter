    "To solve the equation \\( 83e - 81 = 1247 \\) for \\( e \\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation is a linear equation in the form of \\( ax + b = c \\), where \\( a = 83 \\), \\( b = -81 \\), and \\( c = 1247 \\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Term with the Variable**: We need to isolate the term that contains the variable \\( e \\). To do this, we will add 81 to both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant term on the left side.\n\n   \\[\n   83e - 81 + 81 = 1247 + 81\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying both sides, we get:\n\n   \\[\n   83e = 1328\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for the Variable**: Now that we have isolated the term with \\( e \\), we need to solve for \\( e \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 83.\n\n   \\[\n   e = \\frac{1328}{83}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Perform the Division**: Calculate the division to find the value of \\( e \\).\n\n   \\[\n   e = 16\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**: To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \\( e = 16 \\) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.\n\n   \\[\n   83 \\times 16 - 81 = 1247\n   \\]\n\n   Calculate the left side:\n\n   \\[\n   1328 - 81 = 1247\n   \\]\n\n   Since both sides are equal, the solution is verified.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<16>>>"
