    "To solve the equation \\(94q + 39 = 2765\\) for \\(q\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation is a linear equation in the form of \\(ax + b = c\\), where \\(a = 94\\), \\(b = 39\\), and \\(c = 2765\\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Variable**: We need to solve for \\(q\\), so we first need to isolate the term containing \\(q\\) on one side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 39 from both sides of the equation:\n\n   \\[\n   94q + 39 - 39 = 2765 - 39\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n\n   \\[\n   94q = 2726\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(q\\)**: Now that we have isolated the term with \\(q\\), we divide both sides of the equation by 94 to solve for \\(q\\):\n\n   \\[\n   q = \\frac{2726}{94}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Perform the Division**: Calculate the division to find the value of \\(q\\):\n\n   \\[\n   q = 29\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**: To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \\(q = 29\\) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal:\n\n   \\[\n   94 \\times 29 + 39 = 2765\n   \\]\n\n   Calculate \\(94 \\times 29\\):\n\n   \\[\n   94 \\times 29 = 2726\n   \\]\n\n   Add 39 to 2726:\n\n   \\[\n   2726 + 39 = 2765\n   \\]\n\n   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution is verified.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<29>>>"
