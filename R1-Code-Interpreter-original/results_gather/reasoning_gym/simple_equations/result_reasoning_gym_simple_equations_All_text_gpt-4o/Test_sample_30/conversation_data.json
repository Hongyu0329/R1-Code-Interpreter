    "To find the value of \\( s \\) in the equation \\( 360 \\times s = 16560 \\), we need to solve for \\( s \\). Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation given is \\( 360 \\times s = 16560 \\). This is a simple linear equation where \\( s \\) is multiplied by 360 to give 16560.\n\n2. **Isolate the Variable**: To find the value of \\( s \\), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. This can be done by dividing both sides of the equation by 360.\n\n3. **Perform the Division**: \n   \\[\n   s = \\frac{16560}{360}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the Division**: \n   - First, check if the division can be simplified by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 16560 and 360.\n   - The GCD of 16560 and 360 is 360.\n   - Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:\n     \\[\n     s = \\frac{16560 \\div 360}{360 \\div 360} = \\frac{46}{1} = 46\n     \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**: \n   - Multiply the result by 360 to ensure it equals 16560:\n     \\[\n     360 \\times 46 = 16560\n     \\]\n   - The multiplication checks out, confirming that the solution is correct.\n\nTherefore, the value of \\( s \\) is 46.\n\nFinal answer: <<<46>>>"
