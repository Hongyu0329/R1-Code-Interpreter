    "To find the value of \\( p \\) in the equation \\( 38p + 72 = 3454 \\), we will solve the equation step by step.\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The given equation is \\( 38p + 72 = 3454 \\). Our goal is to isolate \\( p \\) on one side of the equation.\n\n2. **Subtract 72 from Both Sides**: To begin isolating \\( p \\), subtract 72 from both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant term on the left side.\n   \\[\n   38p + 72 - 72 = 3454 - 72\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both sides gives:\n   \\[\n   38p = 3382\n   \\]\n\n3. **Divide Both Sides by 38**: Now, divide both sides of the equation by 38 to solve for \\( p \\).\n   \\[\n   \\frac{38p}{38} = \\frac{3382}{38}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying the left side gives:\n   \\[\n   p = \\frac{3382}{38}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Division**: Perform the division to find the value of \\( p \\).\n   \\[\n   p = 89\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**: To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \\( p = 89 \\) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.\n   \\[\n   38 \\times 89 + 72 = 3454\n   \\]\n   Calculate \\( 38 \\times 89 \\):\n   \\[\n   38 \\times 89 = 3382\n   \\]\n   Add 72 to 3382:\n   \\[\n   3382 + 72 = 3454\n   \\]\n   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution is verified.\n\nThe value of \\( p \\) is correct.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<89>>>."
