    "To solve the equation \\(335x + 63 = 8773\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation is a linear equation in the form \\(ax + b = c\\), where \\(a = 335\\), \\(b = 63\\), and \\(c = 8773\\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Variable Term**: To solve for \\(x\\), we need to isolate the term containing \\(x\\) on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 63 from both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   335x + 63 - 63 = 8773 - 63\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both sides, we get:\n   \\[\n   335x = 8710\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(x\\)**: Now that we have isolated the term with \\(x\\), we can solve for \\(x\\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 335:\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{8710}{335}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Perform the Division**: To find the value of \\(x\\), we need to perform the division:\n   \\[\n   x = 26\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**: To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \\(x = 26\\) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal:\n   \\[\n   335 \\times 26 + 63 = 8773\n   \\]\n   Calculate \\(335 \\times 26\\):\n   \\[\n   335 \\times 26 = 8710\n   \\]\n   Add 63 to 8710:\n   \\[\n   8710 + 63 = 8773\n   \\]\n   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution \\(x = 26\\) is verified.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<26>>>"
