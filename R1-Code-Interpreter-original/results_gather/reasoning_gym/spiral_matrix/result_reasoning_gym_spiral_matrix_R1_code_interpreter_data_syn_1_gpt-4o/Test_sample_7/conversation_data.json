    "To solve this problem, we need to traverse the given matrix in a spiral order. The matrix is:\n\n```\n3 1 0 6 1\n9 6 6 9 0\n0 4 5 3 6\n6 4 2 5 4\n1 5 0 8 4\n```\n\nThe spiral order traversal involves the following steps:\n1. Traverse the top row from left to right.\n2. Traverse the right column from top to bottom.\n3. Traverse the bottom row from right to left.\n4. Traverse the left column from bottom to top.\n5. Repeat the process for the inner sub-matrix.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to get the spiral order of the matrix.\n\n```python\ndef spiral_order(matrix):\n    if not matrix:\n        return []\n\n    result = []\n    while matrix:\n        # Take the first row\n        result += matrix.pop(0)\n        # Take the last element of each remaining row\n        if matrix and matrix[0]:\n            for row in matrix:\n                result.append(row.pop())\n        # Take the last row in reverse order\n        if matrix:\n            result += matrix.pop()[::-1]\n        # Take the first element of each remaining row in reverse order\n        if matrix and matrix[0]:\n            for row in matrix[::-1]:\n                result.append(row.pop(0))\n    return result\n\nmatrix = [\n    [3, 1, 0, 6, 1],\n    [9, 6, 6, 9, 0],\n    [0, 4, 5, 3, 6],\n    [6, 4, 2, 5, 4],\n    [1, 5, 0, 8, 4]\n]\n\nspiral = spiral_order(matrix)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, spiral)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will compute the spiral order of the given matrix and print it in the required format.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the spiral order of the matrix as:\n\n```\n<<<3 1 0 6 1 0 6 4 4 8 0 5 1 6 0 9 6 6 9 3 5 2 4 4 5>>>\n```\n\nThis is the correct spiral order traversal of the given matrix. The process involved iteratively removing the outer layers of the matrix and appending them to the result list in the specified order. The code handles the traversal by popping elements from the matrix and appending them to the result list in the correct sequence.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<3 1 0 6 1 0 6 4 4 8 0 5 1 6 0 9 6 6 9 3 5 2 4 4 5>>>"
