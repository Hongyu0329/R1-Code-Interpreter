    "To solve this problem, we need to traverse the given matrix in a spiral order. The matrix is:\n\n```\n2 0 3 4 9 6\n2 8 2 3 0 9\n6 1 8 7 7 8\n2 4 7 3 2 7\n8 8 8 9 1 3\n5 7 8 4 1 5\n```\n\nThe spiral order traversal involves:\n1. Moving right across the top row.\n2. Moving down the last column.\n3. Moving left across the bottom row.\n4. Moving up the first column.\n5. Repeating the process for the inner sub-matrix.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to get the spiral order of the matrix.\n\n```python\ndef spiral_order(matrix):\n    if not matrix:\n        return []\n\n    result = []\n    while matrix:\n        # Take the first row\n        result += matrix.pop(0)\n        # Take the last element of each remaining row\n        if matrix and matrix[0]:\n            for row in matrix:\n                result.append(row.pop())\n        # Take the last row in reverse order\n        if matrix:\n            result += matrix.pop()[::-1]\n        # Take the first element of each remaining row (in reverse order)\n        if matrix and matrix[0]:\n            for row in matrix[::-1]:\n                result.append(row.pop(0))\n    return result\n\nmatrix = [\n    [2, 0, 3, 4, 9, 6],\n    [2, 8, 2, 3, 0, 9],\n    [6, 1, 8, 7, 7, 8],\n    [2, 4, 7, 3, 2, 7],\n    [8, 8, 8, 9, 1, 3],\n    [5, 7, 8, 4, 1, 5]\n]\n\nspiral = spiral_order(matrix)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, spiral)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will compute the spiral order of the given matrix and print it in the required format.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the spiral order of the matrix as expected. The output is:\n\n```\n<<<2 0 3 4 9 6 9 8 7 3 5 1 4 8 7 5 8 2 6 2 8 2 3 0 7 2 1 9 8 8 4 1 8 7 3 7>>>\n```\n\nThis output represents the elements of the matrix traversed in a spiral order, starting from the top-left corner and moving clockwise. \n\nIf you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!"
