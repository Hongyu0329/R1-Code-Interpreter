    "To solve this problem, we need to traverse the given matrix in a spiral order. The matrix is a 10x10 grid, and we need to extract the elements in a specific order: starting from the top-left corner, moving right, then down, then left, and then up, repeating this process for the inner layers of the matrix.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach to achieve this:\n\n1. Initialize boundaries for the top, bottom, left, and right of the matrix.\n2. Use a loop to traverse the matrix in a spiral order:\n   - Traverse from left to right across the top boundary, then increment the top boundary.\n   - Traverse from top to bottom along the right boundary, then decrement the right boundary.\n   - Traverse from right to left across the bottom boundary, then decrement the bottom boundary.\n   - Traverse from bottom to top along the left boundary, then increment the left boundary.\n3. Continue this process until the boundaries overlap, indicating that all elements have been visited.\n4. Collect the elements in the order they are visited and return them as a space-separated list.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python code:\n\n```python\ndef spiral_order(matrix):\n    if not matrix:\n        return []\n\n    result = []\n    top, bottom = 0, len(matrix) - 1\n    left, right = 0, len(matrix[0]) - 1\n\n    while top <= bottom and left <= right:\n        # Traverse from left to right\n        for i in range(left, right + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[top][i])\n        top += 1\n\n        # Traverse from top to bottom\n        for i in range(top, bottom + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[i][right])\n        right -= 1\n\n        if top <= bottom:\n            # Traverse from right to left\n            for i in range(right, left - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[bottom][i])\n            bottom -= 1\n\n        if left <= right:\n            # Traverse from bottom to top\n            for i in range(bottom, top - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[i][left])\n            left += 1\n\n    return result\n\nmatrix = [\n    [4, 5, 9, 2, 2, 1, 0, 8, 8, 1],\n    [5, 4, 9, 6, 6, 2, 0, 1, 7, 5],\n    [6, 9, 8, 9, 5, 9, 5, 3, 1, 5],\n    [6, 3, 4, 4, 6, 5, 8, 6, 5, 6],\n    [3, 7, 2, 8, 6, 8, 9, 1, 1, 4],\n    [7, 9, 0, 4, 0, 4, 9, 4, 2, 2],\n    [4, 8, 9, 7, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2, 4],\n    [2, 1, 1, 3, 0, 6, 0, 4, 9, 2],\n    [4, 5, 7, 7, 1, 5, 2, 1, 2, 6],\n    [6, 8, 8, 1, 5, 3, 3, 3, 7, 6]\n]\n\nresult = spiral_order(matrix)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, result)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the elements of the matrix in spiral order. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the elements of the matrix in spiral order. The output is formatted as a space-separated list of integers enclosed within triple angle brackets, as required.\n\nThe output is:\n<<<4 5 9 2 2 1 0 8 8 1 5 5 6 4 2 4 2 6 6 7 3 3 3 5 1 8 8 6 4 2 4 7 3 6 6 5 4 9 6 6 2 0 1 7 1 5 1 2 2 9 2 1 2 5 1 7 7 5 1 8 9 7 3 9 8 9 5 9 5 3 6 1 4 1 4 0 6 0 3 1 9 0 2 4 4 6 5 8 9 9 4 6 3 7 4 8 6 8 4 0>>>\n\nThis is the correct spiral order traversal of the given matrix."
