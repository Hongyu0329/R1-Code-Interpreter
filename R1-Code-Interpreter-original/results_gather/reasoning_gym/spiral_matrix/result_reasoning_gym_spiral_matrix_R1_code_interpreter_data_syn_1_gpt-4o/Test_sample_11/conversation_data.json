    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from a given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach. The matrix provided is:\n\n```\n5 7\n2 4\n```\n\nThis is a 2x2 matrix. The spiral order traversal for this matrix would involve:\n\n1. Starting from the top-left corner (5), move right to the next element (7).\n2. Move down to the next row (4).\n3. Move left to the previous element in the same row (2).\n\nThe spiral order for this matrix should be: 5, 7, 4, 2.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to ensure correctness and handle any matrix size in general.\n\n```python\ndef spiral_order(matrix):\n    if not matrix:\n        return []\n    \n    result = []\n    while matrix:\n        # Add the first row\n        result += matrix.pop(0)\n        # Add the last element of each remaining row\n        if matrix and matrix[0]:\n            for row in matrix:\n                result.append(row.pop())\n        # Add the last row in reverse order\n        if matrix:\n            result += matrix.pop()[::-1]\n        # Add the first element of each remaining row (in reverse order)\n        if matrix and matrix[0]:\n            for row in matrix[::-1]:\n                result.append(row.pop(0))\n    return result\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [5, 7],\n    [2, 4]\n]\n\n# Get the spiral order\nspiral = spiral_order(matrix)\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, spiral)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will compute the spiral order of the given matrix and print it in the specified format.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the expected output for the given matrix. The spiral order of the matrix:\n\n```\n5 7\n2 4\n```\n\nis correctly computed as:\n\n<<<5 7 4 2>>>\n\nThis matches the expected spiral order traversal, starting from the top-left corner and moving in a clockwise direction."
