    "To solve this problem, we need to traverse the given matrix in a spiral order. The matrix is:\n\n```\n0 3 7 8 4 7 5 2\n8 3 2 1 8 2 8 3\n6 8 8 4 5 9 2 4\n5 3 7 3 4 6 4 3\n9 1 5 2 5 0 6 3\n1 0 5 2 7 6 8 6\n9 9 7 7 5 0 4 0\n4 6 4 2 7 8 1 2\n```\n\nThe approach to solve this problem involves:\n1. Initializing boundaries for the rows and columns.\n2. Iteratively traversing the matrix in a spiral manner by adjusting the boundaries after each complete traversal of a row or column.\n3. Collecting the elements in the order they are visited.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to get the spiral order of the matrix.\n\n```python\ndef spiral_order(matrix):\n    if not matrix:\n        return []\n\n    result = []\n    top, bottom = 0, len(matrix) - 1\n    left, right = 0, len(matrix[0]) - 1\n\n    while top <= bottom and left <= right:\n        # Traverse from left to right along the top row\n        for i in range(left, right + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[top][i])\n        top += 1\n\n        # Traverse from top to bottom along the right column\n        for i in range(top, bottom + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[i][right])\n        right -= 1\n\n        if top <= bottom:\n            # Traverse from right to left along the bottom row\n            for i in range(right, left - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[bottom][i])\n            bottom -= 1\n\n        if left <= right:\n            # Traverse from bottom to top along the left column\n            for i in range(bottom, top - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[i][left])\n            left += 1\n\n    return result\n\nmatrix = [\n    [0, 3, 7, 8, 4, 7, 5, 2],\n    [8, 3, 2, 1, 8, 2, 8, 3],\n    [6, 8, 8, 4, 5, 9, 2, 4],\n    [5, 3, 7, 3, 4, 6, 4, 3],\n    [9, 1, 5, 2, 5, 0, 6, 3],\n    [1, 0, 5, 2, 7, 6, 8, 6],\n    [9, 9, 7, 7, 5, 0, 4, 0],\n    [4, 6, 4, 2, 7, 8, 1, 2]\n]\n\nspiral = spiral_order(matrix)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, spiral)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the elements of the matrix in spiral order.
