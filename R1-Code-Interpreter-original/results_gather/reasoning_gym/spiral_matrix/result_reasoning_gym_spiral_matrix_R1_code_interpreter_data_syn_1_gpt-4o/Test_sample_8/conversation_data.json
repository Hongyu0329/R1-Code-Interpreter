    "To solve this problem, we need to traverse the given matrix in a spiral order. The matrix is a 9x9 grid, and we will start from the top-left corner and move in a clockwise spiral pattern. The steps are as follows:\n\n1. Traverse from left to right across the top row.\n2. Traverse down the rightmost column.\n3. Traverse from right to left across the bottom row.\n4. Traverse up the leftmost column.\n5. Repeat the process for the inner sub-matrix.\n\nWe will continue this process until all elements have been visited.
