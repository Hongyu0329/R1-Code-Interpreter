    "To solve this problem, we need to traverse the given matrix in a spiral order. The matrix is a 10x10 grid, and we will start from the top-left corner and move in a clockwise spiral pattern until all elements are visited.\n\nThe steps to achieve this are as follows:\n1. Initialize boundaries for the top, bottom, left, and right of the matrix.\n2. Traverse from left to right across the top boundary, then move the top boundary down.\n3. Traverse from top to bottom along the right boundary, then move the right boundary left.\n4. Traverse from right to left across the bottom boundary, then move the bottom boundary up.\n5.
