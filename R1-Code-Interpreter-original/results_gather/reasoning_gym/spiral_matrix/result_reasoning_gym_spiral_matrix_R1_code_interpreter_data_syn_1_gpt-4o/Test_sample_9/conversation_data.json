    "To solve this problem, we need to traverse the given matrix in a spiral order. The matrix is an 8x8 grid, and we need to extract the elements in a specific order: starting from the top-left corner, moving right, then down, then left, and then up, repeating this process for the inner layers of the matrix.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n1. Initialize boundaries for the top, bottom, left, and right of the matrix.\n2. Use a loop to traverse the matrix in a spiral order:\n   - Traverse from left to right across the top boundary.\n   - Traverse from top to bottom along the right boundary.\n   - Traverse from right to left across the bottom boundary, if the top and bottom boundaries haven't crossed.\n   - Traverse from bottom to top along the left boundary, if the left and right boundaries haven't crossed.\n3. After each traversal, adjust the boundaries inward.\n4. Continue the process until all elements are visited.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to get the spiral order of the matrix.\n\n```python\ndef spiral_order(matrix):\n    if not matrix:\n        return []\n\n    result = []\n    top, bottom = 0, len(matrix) - 1\n    left, right = 0, len(matrix[0]) - 1\n\n    while top <= bottom and left <= right:\n        # Traverse from left to right along the top boundary\n        for i in range(left, right + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[top][i])\n        top += 1\n\n        # Traverse from top to bottom along the right boundary\n        for i in range(top, bottom + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[i][right])\n        right -= 1\n\n        if top <= bottom:\n            # Traverse from right to left along the bottom boundary\n            for i in range(right, left - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[bottom][i])\n            bottom -= 1\n\n        if left <= right:\n            # Traverse from bottom to top along the left boundary\n            for i in range(bottom, top - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[i][left])\n            left += 1\n\n    return result\n\nmatrix = [\n    [4, 0, 1, 1, 5, 2, 0, 1],\n    [4, 9, 6, 6, 7, 1, 5, 9],\n    [4, 0, 0, 2, 4, 2, 0, 0],\n    [7, 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1],\n    [9, 1, 2, 2, 9, 6, 0, 0],\n    [4, 4, 6, 9, 8, 0, 2, 2],\n    [9, 9, 6, 3, 9, 5, 3, 5],\n    [7, 3, 2, 2, 6, 1, 3, 2]\n]\n\nspiral = spiral_order(matrix)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, spiral)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the elements of the matrix in spiral order. Let's execute it to get the result.",
