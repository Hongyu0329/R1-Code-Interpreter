    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from a given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach to traverse the matrix in a spiral pattern. The matrix provided is:\n\n```\n9 7 6\n7 6 1\n9 6 4\n```\n\nThe steps to achieve this are as follows:\n\n1. Start from the top-left corner and move right across the top row.\n2. Move down the last column.\n3. Move left across the bottom row.\n4. Move up the first column.\n5. Repeat the process for the inner sub-matrix until all elements are visited.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to generate the spiral order of the given matrix.\n\n```python\ndef spiral_order(matrix):\n    if not matrix:\n        return []\n\n    result = []\n    while matrix:\n        # Take the first row\n        result += matrix.pop(0)\n        # Take the last element of each remaining row\n        if matrix and matrix[0]:\n            for row in matrix:\n                result.append(row.pop())\n        # Take the last row in reverse order\n        if matrix:\n            result += matrix.pop()[::-1]\n        # Take the first element of each remaining row (in reverse order)\n        if matrix and matrix[0]:\n            for row in matrix[::-1]:\n                result.append(row.pop(0))\n    return result\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [9, 7, 6],\n    [7, 6, 1],\n    [9, 6, 4]\n]\n\n# Get the spiral order\nspiral = spiral_order(matrix)\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, spiral)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will compute the spiral order of the given matrix and print it in the specified format. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the spiral order of the matrix as `<<<9 7 6 1 4 6 9 7 6>>>`. This output matches the expected spiral traversal of the given matrix:\n\n1. Start from the top-left corner and move right: `9, 7, 6`\n2. Move down the last column: `1`\n3. Move left across the bottom row: `4, 6`\n4. Move up the first column: `9`\n5. Repeat for the inner sub-matrix: `7, 6`\n\nThus, the final spiral order is `9, 7, 6, 1, 4, 6, 9, 7, 6`.\n\n<<<9 7 6 1 4 6 9 7 6>>>"
