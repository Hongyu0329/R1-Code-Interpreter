    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from a given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach to traverse the matrix in a spiral pattern. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Initialize Boundaries**: We need to keep track of the boundaries of the matrix that we haven't traversed yet. These include `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.\n\n2. **Traverse the Matrix**: We will traverse the matrix in a spiral order by:\n   - Moving from left to right across the top row.\n   - Moving from top to bottom down the right column.\n   - Moving from right to left across the bottom row.\n   - Moving from bottom to top up the left column.\n\n3. **Update Boundaries**: After completing a full cycle of the spiral, we update the boundaries to move inward and repeat the process for the inner sub-matrix.\n\n4. **Stop Condition**: The process continues until the `top` boundary exceeds the `bottom` boundary or the `left` boundary exceeds the `right` boundary, indicating that all elements have been visited.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Finally, we output the elements in the order they were visited.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the spiral order for the given matrix.\n\n```python\ndef spiral_order(matrix):\n    if not matrix or not matrix[0]:\n        return []\n\n    top, bottom = 0, len(matrix) - 1\n    left, right = 0, len(matrix[0]) - 1\n    result = []\n\n    while top <= bottom and left <= right:\n        # Traverse from left to right across the top row\n        for i in range(left, right + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[top][i])\n        top += 1\n\n        # Traverse from top to bottom down the right column\n        for i in range(top, bottom + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[i][right])\n        right -= 1\n\n        if top <= bottom:\n            # Traverse from right to left across the bottom row\n            for i in range(right, left - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[bottom][i])\n            bottom -= 1\n\n        if left <= right:\n            # Traverse from bottom to top up the left column\n            for i in range(bottom, top - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[i][left])\n            left += 1\n\n    return result\n\nmatrix = [\n    [7, 2, 8, 7],\n    [2, 5, 2, 3],\n    [4, 7, 4, 0],\n    [2, 0, 1, 1]\n]\n\nspiral = spiral_order(matrix)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, spiral)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will compute the spiral order of the given matrix and print the result in the required format.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the spiral order of the given matrix. The output is:\n\n<<<7 2 8 7 3 0 1 1 0 2 4 2 5 2 4 7>>>\n\nThis is the list of elements in spiral order, starting from the top-left element and moving clockwise."
