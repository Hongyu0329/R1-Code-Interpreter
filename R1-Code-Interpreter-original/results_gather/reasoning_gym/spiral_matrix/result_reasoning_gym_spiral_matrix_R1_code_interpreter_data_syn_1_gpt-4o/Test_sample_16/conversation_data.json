    "To solve this problem, we need to traverse the given matrix in a spiral order. The matrix is a 10x10 grid, and we will start from the top-left corner and move in a clockwise spiral pattern until all elements are visited.\n\nThe steps to achieve this are:\n1. Start from the top-left corner and move right across the top row.\n2. Move down the last column.\n3. Move left across the bottom row.\n4. Move up the first column.\n5. Repeat the process for the inner sub-matrix.\n\nWe will implement this logic in Python to generate the spiral order of the matrix.\n\n```python\ndef spiral_order(matrix):\n    if not matrix:\n        return []\n\n    result = []\n    top, bottom = 0, len(matrix) - 1\n    left, right = 0, len(matrix[0]) - 1\n\n    while top <= bottom and left <= right:\n        # Traverse from left to right\n        for i in range(left, right + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[top][i])\n        top += 1\n\n        # Traverse downwards\n        for i in range(top, bottom + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[i][right])\n        right -= 1\n\n        if top <= bottom:\n            # Traverse from right to left\n            for i in range(right, left - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[bottom][i])\n            bottom -= 1\n\n        if left <= right:\n            # Traverse upwards\n            for i in range(bottom, top - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[i][left])\n            left += 1\n\n    return result\n\nmatrix = [\n    [0, 2, 7, 2, 8, 5, 1, 9, 4, 6],\n    [9, 9, 5, 5, 0, 1, 7, 1, 3, 4],\n    [2, 4, 4, 4, 2, 6, 3, 3, 5, 9],\n    [1, 9, 2, 3, 4, 6, 2, 4, 2, 0],\n    [7, 8, 8, 2, 3, 0, 3, 2, 9, 0],\n    [8, 5, 6, 5, 2, 8, 8, 3, 6, 6],\n    [4, 6, 3, 2, 8, 3, 5, 9, 6, 1],\n    [4, 6, 5, 7, 2, 2, 0, 7, 6, 7],\n    [9, 6, 1, 1, 1, 9, 9, 7, 4, 6],\n    [9, 2, 5, 8, 8, 3, 7, 8, 0, 5]\n]\n\nspiral_result = spiral_order(matrix)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, spiral_result)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the elements of the matrix in spiral order.
