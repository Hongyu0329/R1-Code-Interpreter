    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from a given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach to traverse the matrix in a spiral pattern. Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Initialize Boundaries**: We need to keep track of the boundaries of the matrix that we haven't traversed yet. These boundaries are `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.\n\n2. **Traverse the Matrix**: We will traverse the matrix in a spiral order by:\n   - Moving from left to right across the top boundary.\n   - Moving from top to bottom along the right boundary.\n   - Moving from right to left across the bottom boundary.\n   - Moving from bottom to top along the left boundary.\n\n3. **Update Boundaries**: After completing each direction, we update the respective boundary to move inward.\n\n4. **Repeat**: Continue the process until all elements are visited.\n\n5. **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where the matrix might be empty or have only one row or column.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the spiral order of the given matrix.\n\n```python\ndef spiral_order(matrix):\n    if not matrix or not matrix[0]:\n        return []\n\n    top, bottom = 0, len(matrix) - 1\n    left, right = 0, len(matrix[0]) - 1\n    result = []\n\n    while top <= bottom and left <= right:\n        # Traverse from left to right along the top row\n        for i in range(left, right + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[top][i])\n        top += 1\n\n        # Traverse from top to bottom along the right column\n        for i in range(top, bottom + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[i][right])\n        right -= 1\n\n        if top <= bottom:\n            # Traverse from right to left along the bottom row\n            for i in range(right, left - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[bottom][i])\n            bottom -= 1\n\n        if left <= right:\n            # Traverse from bottom to top along the left column\n            for i in range(bottom, top - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[i][left])\n            left += 1\n\n    return result\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [7, 8, 3, 7],\n    [8, 5, 1, 6],\n    [7, 1, 2, 6],\n    [4, 0, 5, 1]\n]\n\n# Get the spiral order\nspiral_list = spiral_order(matrix)\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, spiral_list)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will compute the spiral order of the given matrix and print it in the specified format.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the spiral order of the given matrix. The output is formatted as requested, with the elements in a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets. \n\nThe spiral order for the given matrix is:\n- Start from the top-left corner and move right: 7, 8, 3, 7\n- Move down the right column: 6, 6\n- Move left along the bottom row: 1, 5, 0, 4\n- Move up the left column: 7\n- Move right along the second row: 8, 5, 1\n- Move down the second column from the right: 2\n- Finally, the center element: 1\n\nThus, the final spiral order is: 7, 8, 3, 7, 6, 6, 1, 5, 0, 4, 7, 8, 5, 1, 2, 1.\n\n<<<7 8 3 7 6 6 1 5 0 4 7 8 5 1 2 1>>>"
