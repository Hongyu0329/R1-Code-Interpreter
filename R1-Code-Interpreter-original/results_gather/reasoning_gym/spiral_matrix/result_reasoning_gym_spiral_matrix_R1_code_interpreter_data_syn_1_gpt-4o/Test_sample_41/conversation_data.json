    "To solve this problem, we need to traverse the given matrix in a spiral order. The matrix is:\n\n```\n5 7 2 1 7 1\n8 9 6 6 8 6\n1 6 0 4 4 5\n7 9 0 7 0 9\n3 8 9 7 4 8\n2 3 8 7 1 6\n```\n\nThe dimensions of the matrix are 6 rows by 6 columns. The spiral order traversal involves moving right across the top row, then down the rightmost column, then left across the bottom row, and finally up the leftmost column. This process is repeated for the inner sub-matrix until all elements are visited.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to generate the spiral order of the matrix.\n\n```python\ndef spiral_order(matrix):\n    if not matrix:\n        return []\n\n    result = []\n    top, bottom = 0, len(matrix) - 1\n    left, right = 0, len(matrix[0]) - 1\n\n    while top <= bottom and left <= right:\n        # Traverse from left to right\n        for i in range(left, right + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[top][i])\n        top += 1\n\n        # Traverse downwards\n        for i in range(top, bottom + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[i][right])\n        right -= 1\n\n        if top <= bottom:\n            # Traverse from right to left\n            for i in range(right, left - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[bottom][i])\n            bottom -= 1\n\n        if left <= right:\n            # Traverse upwards\n            for i in range(bottom, top - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[i][left])\n            left += 1\n\n    return result\n\nmatrix = [\n    [5, 7, 2, 1, 7, 1],\n    [8, 9, 6, 6, 8, 6],\n    [1, 6, 0, 4, 4, 5],\n    [7, 9, 0, 7, 0, 9],\n    [3, 8, 9, 7, 4, 8],\n    [2, 3, 8, 7, 1, 6]\n]\n\nspiral = spiral_order(matrix)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, spiral)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the elements of the matrix in spiral order.
