    "To solve this problem, we need to traverse the given matrix in a spiral order. The matrix is:\n\n```\n7 3 3 5 8 7 6\n0 6 2 6 7 2 1\n3 2 1 1 4 4 6\n3 9 5 8 4 6 0\n7 6 9 2 7 0 8\n5 0 8 5 0 8 8\n6 4 3 4 9 2 9\n```\n\nThe dimensions of the matrix are 7 rows by 7 columns. The spiral order traversal involves:\n1. Moving right across the top row.\n2. Moving down the last column.\n3. Moving left across the bottom row.\n4. Moving up the first column.\n5. Repeating the process for the inner submatrix.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to generate the spiral order of the matrix.\n\n```python\ndef spiral_order(matrix):\n    if not matrix:\n        return []\n\n    result = []\n    top, bottom = 0, len(matrix) - 1\n    left, right = 0, len(matrix[0]) - 1\n\n    while top <= bottom and left <= right:\n        # Traverse from left to right\n        for i in range(left, right + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[top][i])\n        top += 1\n\n        # Traverse downwards\n        for i in range(top, bottom + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[i][right])\n        right -= 1\n\n        if top <= bottom:\n            # Traverse from right to left\n            for i in range(right, left - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[bottom][i])\n            bottom -= 1\n\n        if left <= right:\n            # Traverse upwards\n            for i in range(bottom, top - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[i][left])\n            left += 1\n\n    return result\n\nmatrix = [\n    [7, 3, 3, 5, 8, 7, 6],\n    [0, 6, 2, 6, 7, 2, 1],\n    [3, 2, 1, 1, 4, 4, 6],\n    [3, 9, 5, 8, 4, 6, 0],\n    [7, 6, 9, 2, 7, 0, 8],\n    [5, 0, 8, 5, 0, 8, 8],\n    [6, 4, 3, 4, 9, 2, 9]\n]\n\nspiral = spiral_order(matrix)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, spiral)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will compute the spiral order of the given matrix and print it in the required format.",
