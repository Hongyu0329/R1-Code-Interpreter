    "To solve this problem, we need to traverse the given matrix in a spiral order. The matrix is a 10x10 grid, and we need to extract the elements in a specific order: starting from the top-left corner, moving right, then down, then left, and then up, repeating this process for the inner layers of the matrix.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Initialize boundaries for the top, bottom, left, and right of the matrix.\n2. Use a loop to traverse the matrix in a spiral order:\n   - Traverse from left to right across the top boundary.\n   - Traverse from top to bottom along the right boundary.\n   - Traverse from right to left across the bottom boundary, if the top and bottom boundaries haven't crossed.\n   - Traverse from bottom to top along the left boundary, if the left and right boundaries haven't crossed.\n3. After completing a full spiral loop, adjust the boundaries inward and repeat until all elements are visited.\n4. Collect the elements in the order they are visited and print them as a space-separated list.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the spiral order of the matrix.\n\n```python\ndef spiral_order(matrix):\n    if not matrix:\n        return []\n\n    result = []\n    top, bottom = 0, len(matrix) - 1\n    left, right = 0, len(matrix[0]) - 1\n\n    while top <= bottom and left <= right:\n        # Traverse from left to right along the top row\n        for i in range(left, right + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[top][i])\n        top += 1\n\n        # Traverse from top to bottom along the right column\n        for i in range(top, bottom + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[i][right])\n        right -= 1\n\n        if top <= bottom:\n            # Traverse from right to left along the bottom row\n            for i in range(right, left - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[bottom][i])\n            bottom -= 1\n\n        if left <= right:\n            # Traverse from bottom to top along the left column\n            for i in range(bottom, top - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[i][left])\n            left += 1\n\n    return result\n\nmatrix = [\n    [0, 2, 4, 9, 7, 9, 0, 8, 9, 9],\n    [6, 3, 1, 9, 6, 5, 2, 1, 3, 8],\n    [8, 3, 0, 1, 4, 3, 5, 7, 1, 3],\n    [5, 4, 6, 6, 1, 5, 2, 4, 5, 0],\n    [5, 6, 5, 8, 3, 4, 8, 6, 5, 6],\n    [3, 4, 6, 4, 8, 2, 0, 7, 2, 7],\n    [5, 5, 3, 4, 6, 9, 8, 1, 6, 5],\n    [0, 8, 3, 7, 4, 0, 7, 2, 4, 3],\n    [1, 6, 6, 3, 8, 0, 5, 9, 1, 5],\n    [1, 9, 4, 5, 3, 2, 8, 3, 3, 3]\n]\n\nspiral = spiral_order(matrix)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, spiral)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the elements of the matrix in spiral order.
