    "To solve this problem, we need to traverse the given matrix in a spiral order. The matrix is a 9x9 grid, and we need to extract the elements in a specific order: starting from the top-left corner, moving right, then down, then left, and then up, repeating this process for the inner layers of the matrix.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach to achieve this:\n\n1. Initialize boundaries for the top, bottom, left, and right of the matrix.\n2. Use a loop to traverse the matrix while the top boundary is less than or equal to the bottom boundary and the left boundary is less than or equal to the right boundary.\n3. Traverse from left to right along the top boundary, then increment the top boundary.\n4. Traverse from top to bottom along the right boundary, then decrement the right boundary.\n5. If the top boundary is still less than or equal to the bottom boundary, traverse from right to left along the bottom boundary, then decrement the bottom boundary.\n6. If the left boundary is still less than or equal to the right boundary, traverse from bottom to top along the left boundary, then increment the left boundary.\n7. Repeat the process until all elements are visited.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to get the spiral order of the matrix.\n\n```python\ndef spiral_order(matrix):\n    if not matrix:\n        return []\n\n    result = []\n    top, bottom = 0, len(matrix) - 1\n    left, right = 0, len(matrix[0]) - 1\n\n    while top <= bottom and left <= right:\n        # Traverse from left to right\n        for i in range(left, right + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[top][i])\n        top += 1\n\n        # Traverse from top to bottom\n        for i in range(top, bottom + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[i][right])\n        right -= 1\n\n        if top <= bottom:\n            # Traverse from right to left\n            for i in range(right, left - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[bottom][i])\n            bottom -= 1\n\n        if left <= right:\n            # Traverse from bottom to top\n            for i in range(bottom, top - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[i][left])\n            left += 1\n\n    return result\n\nmatrix = [\n    [6, 7, 3, 9, 3, 7, 3, 4, 6],\n    [7, 1, 5, 6, 6, 9, 1, 6, 7],\n    [3, 2, 1, 0, 5, 5, 6, 5, 6],\n    [3, 2, 2, 8, 8, 6, 6, 4, 0],\n    [5, 9, 6, 0, 9, 9, 1, 4, 8],\n    [8, 3, 0, 8, 2, 8, 9, 7, 9],\n    [1, 1, 7, 8, 8, 7, 2, 4, 1],\n    [0, 6, 2, 0, 5, 0, 1, 9, 6],\n    [7, 0, 8, 7, 8, 6, 2, 4, 9]\n]\n\nspiral = spiral_order(matrix)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, spiral)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the elements of the matrix in spiral order.
