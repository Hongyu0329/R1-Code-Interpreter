    "To solve this problem, we need to traverse the given matrix in a spiral order. The matrix is:\n\n```\n9 4 5 9 9\n2 2 0 3 4\n9 7 4 8 2\n8 3 1 5 4\n6 3 1 2 6\n```\n\nThe spiral order traversal involves:\n1. Moving right across the top row.\n2. Moving down the last column.\n3. Moving left across the bottom row.\n4. Moving up the first column.\n5. Repeating the process for the inner sub-matrix.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this traversal and generate the list of elements in spiral order.\n\n```python\ndef spiral_order(matrix):\n    if not matrix:\n        return []\n\n    result = []\n    while matrix:\n        # Take the first row\n        result += matrix.pop(0)\n        # Take the last element of each remaining row\n        if matrix and matrix[0]:\n            for row in matrix:\n                result.append(row.pop())\n        # Take the last row in reverse order\n        if matrix:\n            result += matrix.pop()[::-1]\n        # Take the first element of each remaining row (in reverse order)\n        if matrix and matrix[0]:\n            for row in matrix[::-1]:\n                result.append(row.pop(0))\n    return result\n\nmatrix = [\n    [9, 4, 5, 9, 9],\n    [2, 2, 0, 3, 4],\n    [9, 7, 4, 8, 2],\n    [8, 3, 1, 5, 4],\n    [6, 3, 1, 2, 6]\n]\n\nspiral_list = spiral_order(matrix)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, spiral_list)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the elements of the matrix in spiral order. Let's execute it to get the result.",
