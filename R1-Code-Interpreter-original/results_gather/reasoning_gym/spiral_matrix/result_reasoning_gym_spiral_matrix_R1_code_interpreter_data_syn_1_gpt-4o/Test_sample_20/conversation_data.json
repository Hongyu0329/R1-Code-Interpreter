    "To solve this problem, we need to traverse the given matrix in a spiral order. The matrix is a 6x6 grid, and we need to extract the elements in the specified order. The steps to achieve this are as follows:\n\n1. Start from the top-left corner of the matrix.\n2. Traverse the first row from left to right.\n3. Traverse the last column from top to bottom.\n4. Traverse the last row from right to left.\n5. Traverse the first column from bottom to top.\n6. Repeat the above steps for the inner sub-matrix until all elements are visited.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to get the spiral order of the matrix.\n\n```python\ndef spiral_order(matrix):\n    if not matrix:\n        return []\n\n    result = []\n    top, bottom = 0, len(matrix) - 1\n    left, right = 0, len(matrix[0]) - 1\n\n    while top <= bottom and left <= right:\n        # Traverse from left to right along the top row\n        for i in range(left, right + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[top][i])\n        top += 1\n\n        # Traverse from top to bottom along the right column\n        for i in range(top, bottom + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[i][right])\n        right -= 1\n\n        if top <= bottom:\n            # Traverse from right to left along the bottom row\n            for i in range(right, left - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[bottom][i])\n            bottom -= 1\n\n        if left <= right:\n            # Traverse from bottom to top along the left column\n            for i in range(bottom, top - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[i][left])\n            left += 1\n\n    return result\n\nmatrix = [\n    [5, 7, 0, 8, 9, 6],\n    [6, 9, 1, 0, 8, 6],\n    [7, 0, 2, 6, 3, 2],\n    [2, 0, 1, 4, 2, 3],\n    [0, 7, 1, 0, 5, 7],\n    [5, 7, 7, 2, 6, 6]\n]\n\nspiral = spiral_order(matrix)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, spiral)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the elements of the matrix in spiral order.
