    "To solve this problem, we need to traverse the given matrix in a spiral order. The matrix is a 10x10 grid, and we will start from the top-left corner and move in a clockwise spiral pattern until all elements are visited.\n\nThe steps to achieve this are:\n1. Traverse the top row from left to right.\n2. Traverse the right column from top to bottom.\n3. Traverse the bottom row from right to left.\n4. Traverse the left column from bottom to top.\n5. Repeat the above steps for the inner sub-matrix.\n\nWe will use a loop to iterate over the matrix, adjusting the boundaries (top, bottom, left, right) as we complete each layer of the spiral.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the spiral order of the matrix.\n\n```python\ndef spiral_order(matrix):\n    if not matrix:\n        return []\n\n    result = []\n    top, bottom = 0, len(matrix) - 1\n    left, right = 0, len(matrix[0]) - 1\n\n    while top <= bottom and left <= right:\n        # Traverse from left to right along the top row\n        for i in range(left, right + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[top][i])\n        top += 1\n\n        # Traverse from top to bottom along the right column\n        for i in range(top, bottom + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[i][right])\n        right -= 1\n\n        if top <= bottom:\n            # Traverse from right to left along the bottom row\n            for i in range(right, left - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[bottom][i])\n            bottom -= 1\n\n        if left <= right:\n            # Traverse from bottom to top along the left column\n            for i in range(bottom, top - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[i][left])\n            left += 1\n\n    return result\n\nmatrix = [\n    [4, 2, 4, 8, 0, 1, 4, 7, 9, 5],\n    [5, 1, 8, 5, 6, 0, 0, 0, 3, 6],\n    [3, 9, 5, 1, 8, 0, 7, 7, 6, 8],\n    [5, 8, 6, 3, 1, 6, 4, 5, 8, 2],\n    [0, 2, 8, 0, 1, 7, 8, 6, 3, 1],\n    [5, 9, 9, 0, 1, 1, 8, 4, 7, 0],\n    [9, 2, 5, 2, 7, 8, 7, 9, 8, 0],\n    [0, 9, 2, 0, 2, 5, 4, 9, 2, 1],\n    [7, 2, 5, 5, 6, 8, 7, 9, 1, 4],\n    [9, 7, 9, 2, 6, 4, 1, 1, 7, 0]\n]\n\nspiral = spiral_order(matrix)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, spiral)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the elements of the matrix in spiral order.
