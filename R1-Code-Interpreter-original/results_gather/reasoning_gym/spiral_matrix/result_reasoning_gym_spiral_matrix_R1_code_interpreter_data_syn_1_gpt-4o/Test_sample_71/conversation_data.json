    "To solve this problem, we need to traverse the given matrix in a spiral order. The matrix is a 9x9 grid, and we will start from the top-left corner and move in a clockwise spiral pattern until all elements are visited.\n\nThe steps to achieve this are as follows:\n1. Initialize boundaries for the top, bottom, left, and right of the matrix.\n2. Traverse from left to right across the top boundary, then move the top boundary down.\n3. Traverse from top to bottom along the right boundary, then move the right boundary left.\n4. Traverse from right to left across the bottom boundary, then move the bottom boundary up.\n5. Traverse from bottom to top along the left boundary, then move the left boundary right.\n6. Repeat the above steps until the boundaries overlap, indicating that all elements have been visited.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to generate the spiral order of the matrix.\n\n```python\ndef spiral_order(matrix):\n    if not matrix:\n        return []\n\n    result = []\n    top, bottom = 0, len(matrix) - 1\n    left, right = 0, len(matrix[0]) - 1\n\n    while top <= bottom and left <= right:\n        # Traverse from left to right along the top boundary\n        for i in range(left, right + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[top][i])\n        top += 1\n\n        # Traverse from top to bottom along the right boundary\n        for i in range(top, bottom + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[i][right])\n        right -= 1\n\n        if top <= bottom:\n            # Traverse from right to left along the bottom boundary\n            for i in range(right, left - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[bottom][i])\n            bottom -= 1\n\n        if left <= right:\n            # Traverse from bottom to top along the left boundary\n            for i in range(bottom, top - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[i][left])\n            left += 1\n\n    return result\n\nmatrix = [\n    [5, 0, 6, 3, 8, 4, 3, 6, 1],\n    [0, 0, 1, 7, 1, 7, 9, 9, 7],\n    [1, 4, 4, 0, 1, 6, 7, 1, 7],\n    [1, 1, 9, 8, 0, 9, 9, 5, 6],\n    [1, 4, 2, 7, 6, 3, 7, 8, 3],\n    [8, 9, 4, 3, 9, 1, 4, 8, 3],\n    [4, 2, 5, 9, 0, 7, 6, 3, 2],\n    [7, 6, 9, 3, 8, 4, 9, 1, 2],\n    [2, 8, 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 5, 9]\n]\n\nspiral = spiral_order(matrix)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, spiral)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the elements of the matrix in spiral order.
