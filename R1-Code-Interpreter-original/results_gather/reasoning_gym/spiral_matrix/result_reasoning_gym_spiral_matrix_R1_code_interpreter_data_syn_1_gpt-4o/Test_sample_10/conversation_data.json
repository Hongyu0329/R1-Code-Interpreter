    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from a given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach to traverse the matrix in a spiral pattern. The matrix provided is:\n\n```\n3 1 3\n2 4 9\n1 0 8\n```\n\nThis matrix can be represented as:\n\n```\n[\n    [3, 1, 3],\n    [2, 4, 9],\n    [1, 0, 8]\n]\n```\n\nThe spiral order traversal involves the following steps:\n1. Traverse the first row from left to right.\n2. Traverse the last column from top to bottom.\n3. Traverse the last row from right to left.\n4. Traverse the first column from bottom to top.\n5. Repeat the process for the inner sub-matrix.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the spiral order of the given matrix.\n\n```python\ndef spiral_order(matrix):\n    if not matrix:\n        return []\n\n    result = []\n    while matrix:\n        # Add the first row\n        result += matrix.pop(0)\n        # Add the last column\n        if matrix and matrix[0]:\n            for row in matrix:\n                result.append(row.pop())\n        # Add the last row in reverse order\n        if matrix:\n            result += matrix.pop()[::-1]\n        # Add the first column in reverse order\n        if matrix and matrix[0]:\n            for row in matrix[::-1]:\n                result.append(row.pop(0))\n    return result\n\nmatrix = [\n    [3, 1, 3],\n    [2, 4, 9],\n    [1, 0, 8]\n]\n\nspiral = spiral_order(matrix)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, spiral)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will compute the spiral order of the given matrix and print it in the required format.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the spiral order of the given matrix. The output is:\n\n```\n<<<3 1 3 9 8 0 1 2 4>>>\n```\n\nThis output represents the elements of the matrix traversed in a spiral order starting from the top-left corner. \n\nThe steps followed in the code are:\n1. Start from the top-left corner and move right: `3, 1, 3`\n2. Move down the last column: `9`\n3. Move left along the bottom row: `8, 0`\n4. Move up the first column: `1`\n5. Move right along the remaining row: `2, 4`\n\nThus, the spiral order of the matrix is correctly computed as `3 1 3 9 8 0 1 2 4`.\n\n<<<3 1 3 9 8 0 1 2 4>>>"
