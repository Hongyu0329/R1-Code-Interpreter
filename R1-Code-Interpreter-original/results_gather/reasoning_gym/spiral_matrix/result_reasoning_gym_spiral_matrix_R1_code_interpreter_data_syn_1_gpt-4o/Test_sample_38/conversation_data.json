    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from a given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach to traverse the matrix in a spiral pattern. The matrix provided is:\n\n```\n5 1 9\n7 4 2\n7 3 2\n```\n\nThis matrix can be represented as a 2D list in Python:\n\n```python\nmatrix = [\n    [5, 1, 9],\n    [7, 4, 2],\n    [7, 3, 2]\n]\n```\n\nThe spiral order traversal involves:\n1. Moving right across the top row.\n2. Moving down the last column.\n3. Moving left across the bottom row.\n4. Moving up the first column.\n5. Repeating the process for the inner sub-matrix.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this traversal and print the elements in spiral order.\n\n```python\ndef spiral_order(matrix):\n    if not matrix:\n        return []\n    \n    result = []\n    while matrix:\n        # Take the first row\n        result += matrix.pop(0)\n        # Take the last element of each remaining row\n        if matrix and matrix[0]:\n            for row in matrix:\n                result.append(row.pop())\n        # Take the last row in reverse order\n        if matrix:\n            result += matrix.pop()[::-1]\n        # Take the first element of each remaining row (in reverse order)\n        if matrix and matrix[0]:\n            for row in matrix[::-1]:\n                result.append(row.pop(0))\n    return result\n\nmatrix = [\n    [5, 1, 9],\n    [7, 4, 2],\n    [7, 3, 2]\n]\n\nspiral_elements = spiral_order(matrix)\nprint(\" \".join(map(str, spiral_elements)))\n```\n\nThis code will output the elements of the matrix in spiral order. Let's execute it to get the result."
