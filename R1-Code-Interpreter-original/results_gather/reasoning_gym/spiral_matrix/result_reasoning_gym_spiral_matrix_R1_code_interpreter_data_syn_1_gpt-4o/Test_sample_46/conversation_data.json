    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from a given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach to traverse the matrix in a spiral pattern. The steps are as follows:\n\n1. Start from the top-left corner of the matrix.\n2. Traverse the first row from left to right.\n3. Traverse the last column from top to bottom.\n4. Traverse the last row from right to left.\n5. Traverse the first column from bottom to top.\n6. Repeat the above steps for the inner sub-matrix until all elements are visited.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the spiral order of the given matrix.\n\n```python\ndef spiral_order(matrix):\n    if not matrix:\n        return []\n\n    result = []\n    while matrix:\n        # Take the first row\n        result += matrix.pop(0)\n        # Take the last element of each remaining row\n        if matrix and matrix[0]:\n            for row in matrix:\n                result.append(row.pop())\n        # Take the last row in reverse order\n        if matrix:\n            result += matrix.pop()[::-1]\n        # Take the first element of each remaining row in reverse order\n        if matrix and matrix[0]:\n            for row in matrix[::-1]:\n                result.append(row.pop(0))\n    return result\n\nmatrix = [\n    [1, 5, 5, 6, 8],\n    [4, 2, 3, 6, 1],\n    [6, 2, 4, 0, 0],\n    [3, 2, 7, 5, 2],\n    [3, 6, 5, 0, 6]\n]\n\nspiral = spiral_order(matrix)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, spiral)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will compute the spiral order of the given matrix and print it in the required format.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the spiral order of the given matrix. The output is formatted as a space-separated list of integers enclosed within triple angle brackets, as required.\n\nThe spiral order of the matrix is:\n1. Start from the top-left corner and move right: 1, 5, 5, 6, 8\n2. Move down the last column: 1, 0, 2, 6\n3. Move left along the bottom row: 0, 5, 6, 3\n4. Move up the first column: 3, 6\n5. Repeat for the inner sub-matrix: 4, 2, 3, 6\n6. Continue the spiral: 0, 5, 7, 2\n7. Finally, the center: 2, 4\n\nThe final spiral order is: <<<1 5 5 6 8 1 0 2 6 0 5 6 3 3 6 4 2 3 6 0 5 7 2 2 4>>>\n\nThis matches the expected traversal of the matrix in a spiral order."
