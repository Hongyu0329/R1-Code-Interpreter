    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from a given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach. The matrix provided is:\n\n```\n3 2 4\n4 5 2\n1 1 7\n```\n\nThis matrix can be represented as:\n\n```\n[\n    [3, 2, 4],\n    [4, 5, 2],\n    [1, 1, 7]\n]\n```\n\nThe spiral order traversal involves:\n1. Traversing the top row from left to right.\n2. Traversing the right column from top to bottom.\n3. Traversing the bottom row from right to left.\n4. Traversing the left column from bottom to top.\n5. Repeating the above steps for the inner sub-matrix.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the spiral order of the given matrix.\n\n```python\ndef spiral_order(matrix):\n    if not matrix:\n        return []\n    \n    result = []\n    while matrix:\n        # Take the first row\n        result += matrix.pop(0)\n        # Take the last element of each remaining row\n        if matrix and matrix[0]:\n            for row in matrix:\n                result.append(row.pop())\n        # Take the last row in reverse order\n        if matrix:\n            result += matrix.pop()[::-1]\n        # Take the first element of each remaining row in reverse order\n        if matrix and matrix[0]:\n            for row in matrix[::-1]:\n                result.append(row.pop(0))\n    return result\n\nmatrix = [\n    [3, 2, 4],\n    [4, 5, 2],\n    [1, 1, 7]\n]\n\nspiral_list = spiral_order(matrix)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, spiral_list)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will compute the spiral order of the matrix and print it in the required format. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the spiral order of the matrix as `<<<3 2 4 2 7 1 1 4 5>>>`. This output is correct based on the spiral traversal of the given matrix:\n\n1. Start at the top-left corner and move right: `3, 2, 4`\n2. Move down the right column: `2, 7`\n3. Move left along the bottom row: `1, 1`\n4. Move up the left column: `4`\n5. Finally, move right along the remaining row: `5`\n\nThus, the spiral order of the matrix is correctly represented as `<<<3 2 4 2 7 1 1 4 5>>>`.\n\n<<<3 2 4 2 7 1 1 4 5>>>"
