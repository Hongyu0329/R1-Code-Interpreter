    "To solve this problem, we need to traverse the given matrix in a spiral order. The matrix is:\n\n```\n6 7 1 5 2 8\n6 0 0 0 3 8\n5 3 7 1 3 4\n6 6 0 9 8 4\n2 2 6 6 5 6\n2 5 8 4 3 0\n```\n\nThe spiral order traversal involves:\n1. Moving right across the top row.\n2. Moving down the last column.\n3. Moving left across the bottom row.\n4. Moving up the first column.\n5. Repeating the process for the inner sub-matrix.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to get the spiral order of the matrix.\n\n```python\ndef spiral_order(matrix):\n    if not matrix:\n        return []\n\n    result = []\n    while matrix:\n        # Take the first row\n        result += matrix.pop(0)\n        # Take the last element of each remaining row\n        if matrix and matrix[0]:\n            for row in matrix:\n                result.append(row.pop())\n        # Take the last row in reverse order\n        if matrix:\n            result += matrix.pop()[::-1]\n        # Take the first element of each remaining row in reverse order\n        if matrix and matrix[0]:\n            for row in matrix[::-1]:\n                result.append(row.pop(0))\n    return result\n\nmatrix = [\n    [6, 7, 1, 5, 2, 8],\n    [6, 0, 0, 0, 3, 8],\n    [5, 3, 7, 1, 3, 4],\n    [6, 6, 0, 9, 8, 4],\n    [2, 2, 6, 6, 5, 6],\n    [2, 5, 8, 4, 3, 0]\n]\n\nspiral = spiral_order(matrix)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, spiral)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the elements of the matrix in spiral order. Let's execute it to get the result.",
