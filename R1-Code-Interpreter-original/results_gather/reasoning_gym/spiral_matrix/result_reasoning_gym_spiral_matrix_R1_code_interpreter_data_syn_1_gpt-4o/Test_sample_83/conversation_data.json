    "To solve this problem, we need to traverse the given matrix in a spiral order. The matrix is:\n\n```\n1 2 3 8 1 4\n3 3 8 9 8 0\n3 2 5 6 5 4\n4 7 9 7 5 3\n9 8 8 0 2 2\n0 8 2 2 4 2\n```\n\nThe spiral order traversal involves:\n1. Moving right across the top row.\n2. Moving down the last column.\n3. Moving left across the bottom row.\n4. Moving up the first column.\n5. Repeating the process for the inner sub-matrix.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to get the spiral order of the matrix.\n\n```python\ndef spiral_order(matrix):\n    if not matrix:\n        return []\n\n    result = []\n    while matrix:\n        # Take the first row\n        result += matrix.pop(0)\n        # Take the last element of each remaining row\n        if matrix and matrix[0]:\n            for row in matrix:\n                result.append(row.pop())\n        # Take the last row in reverse order\n        if matrix:\n            result += matrix.pop()[::-1]\n        # Take the first element of each remaining row in reverse order\n        if matrix and matrix[0]:\n            for row in matrix[::-1]:\n                result.append(row.pop(0))\n    return result\n\nmatrix = [\n    [1, 2, 3, 8, 1, 4],\n    [3, 3, 8, 9, 8, 0],\n    [3, 2, 5, 6, 5, 4],\n    [4, 7, 9, 7, 5, 3],\n    [9, 8, 8, 0, 2, 2],\n    [0, 8, 2, 2, 4, 2]\n]\n\nspiral = spiral_order(matrix)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, spiral)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the elements of the matrix in spiral order. Let's execute it to get the result.",
