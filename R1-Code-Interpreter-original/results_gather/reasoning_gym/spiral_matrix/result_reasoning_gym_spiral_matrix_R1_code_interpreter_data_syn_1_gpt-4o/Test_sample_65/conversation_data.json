    "To solve this problem, we need to traverse the given matrix in a spiral order. The matrix is:\n\n```\n8 0 0 3 7\n1 4 5 7 5\n2 5 1 6 1\n3 4 6 9 8\n0 0 4 2 0\n```\n\nThe spiral order traversal involves:\n1. Moving right across the top row.\n2. Moving down the last column.\n3. Moving left across the bottom row.\n4. Moving up the first column.\n5. Repeating the process for the inner sub-matrix.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this traversal and generate the list of elements in spiral order.\n\n```python\ndef spiral_order(matrix):\n    if not matrix:\n        return []\n\n    result = []\n    while matrix:\n        # Take the first row\n        result += matrix.pop(0)\n        # Take the last element of each remaining row\n        if matrix and matrix[0]:\n            for row in matrix:\n                result.append(row.pop())\n        # Take the last row, if any\n        if matrix:\n            result += matrix.pop()[::-1]\n        # Take the first element of each remaining row, if any\n        if matrix and matrix[0]:\n            for row in matrix[::-1]:\n                result.append(row.pop(0))\n    return result\n\nmatrix = [\n    [8, 0, 0, 3, 7],\n    [1, 4, 5, 7, 5],\n    [2, 5, 1, 6, 1],\n    [3, 4, 6, 9, 8],\n    [0, 0, 4, 2, 0]\n]\n\nresult = spiral_order(matrix)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, result)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the elements of the matrix in spiral order. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the spiral order of the matrix. The output is:\n\n<<<8 0 0 3 7 5 1 8 0 2 4 0 0 3 2 1 4 5 7 6 9 6 4 5 1>>>\n\nThis is the list of elements in spiral order for the given matrix."
