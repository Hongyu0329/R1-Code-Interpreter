    "To solve this problem, we need to traverse the given matrix in a spiral order. The matrix is:\n\n```\n1 6 6 9 3 9\n0 0 5 5 6 8\n5 9 7 1 2 3\n8 2 2 5 5 2\n3 6 5 4 4 3\n2 0 9 8 6 8\n```\n\nThe spiral order traversal involves:\n1. Moving right across the top row.\n2. Moving down the last column.\n3. Moving left across the bottom row.\n4. Moving up the first column.\n5. Repeating the process for the inner sub-matrix.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the spiral order of the matrix.\n\n```python\ndef spiral_order(matrix):\n    if not matrix:\n        return []\n\n    result = []\n    top, bottom = 0, len(matrix) - 1\n    left, right = 0, len(matrix[0]) - 1\n\n    while top <= bottom and left <= right:\n        # Traverse from left to right\n        for i in range(left, right + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[top][i])\n        top += 1\n\n        # Traverse downwards\n        for i in range(top, bottom + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[i][right])\n        right -= 1\n\n        if top <= bottom:\n            # Traverse from right to left\n            for i in range(right, left - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[bottom][i])\n            bottom -= 1\n\n        if left <= right:\n            # Traverse upwards\n            for i in range(bottom, top - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[i][left])\n            left += 1\n\n    return result\n\nmatrix = [\n    [1, 6, 6, 9, 3, 9],\n    [0, 0, 5, 5, 6, 8],\n    [5, 9, 7, 1, 2, 3],\n    [8, 2, 2, 5, 5, 2],\n    [3, 6, 5, 4, 4, 3],\n    [2, 0, 9, 8, 6, 8]\n]\n\nspiral = spiral_order(matrix)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, spiral)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will compute the spiral order of the given matrix and print it in the required format.",
