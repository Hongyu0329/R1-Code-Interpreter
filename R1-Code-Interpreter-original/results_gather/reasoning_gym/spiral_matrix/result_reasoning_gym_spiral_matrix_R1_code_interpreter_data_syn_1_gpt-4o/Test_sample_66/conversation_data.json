    "To solve this problem, we need to traverse the given matrix in a spiral order. The matrix is:\n\n```\n0 7 9 2 8 9 2\n6 6 4 7 7 2 3\n4 4 5 3 1 0 4\n2 1 0 8 5 6 0\n8 8 1 8 6 5 0\n7 0 8 6 8 9 3\n2 3 8 2 3 5 6\n```\n\nThe approach to solve this problem involves:\n1. Initializing boundaries for the rows and columns.\n2. Iteratively traversing the matrix in a spiral manner:\n   - Traverse from left to right across the top row.\n   - Traverse downwards along the right column.\n   - Traverse from right to left across the bottom row.\n   - Traverse upwards along the left column.\n3. Adjust the boundaries after each traversal to move inward.\n4. Continue the process until all elements are visited.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to generate the spiral order of the matrix.\n\n```python\ndef spiral_order(matrix):\n    if not matrix:\n        return []\n\n    result = []\n    top, bottom = 0, len(matrix) - 1\n    left, right = 0, len(matrix[0]) - 1\n\n    while top <= bottom and left <= right:\n        # Traverse from left to right across the top row\n        for i in range(left, right + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[top][i])\n        top += 1\n\n        # Traverse downwards along the right column\n        for i in range(top, bottom + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[i][right])\n        right -= 1\n\n        if top <= bottom:\n            # Traverse from right to left across the bottom row\n            for i in range(right, left - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[bottom][i])\n            bottom -= 1\n\n        if left <= right:\n            # Traverse upwards along the left column\n            for i in range(bottom, top - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[i][left])\n            left += 1\n\n    return result\n\nmatrix = [\n    [0, 7, 9, 2, 8, 9, 2],\n    [6, 6, 4, 7, 7, 2, 3],\n    [4, 4, 5, 3, 1, 0, 4],\n    [2, 1, 0, 8, 5, 6, 0],\n    [8, 8, 1, 8, 6, 5, 0],\n    [7, 0, 8, 6, 8, 9, 3],\n    [2, 3, 8, 2, 3, 5, 6]\n]\n\nspiral = spiral_order(matrix)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, spiral)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the elements of the matrix in spiral order. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the spiral order of the matrix as:\n\n<<<0 7 9 2 8 9 2 3 4 0 0 3 6 5 3 2 8 3 2 7 8 2 4 6 6 4 7 7 2 0 6 5 9 8 6 8 0 8 1 4 5 3 1 5 6 8 1 0 8>>>\n\nThis is the correct spiral order traversal of the given matrix.
