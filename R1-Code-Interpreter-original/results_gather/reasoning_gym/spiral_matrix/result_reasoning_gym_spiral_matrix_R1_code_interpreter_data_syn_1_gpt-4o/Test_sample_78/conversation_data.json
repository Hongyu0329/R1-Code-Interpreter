    "To solve this problem, we need to traverse the given matrix in a spiral order. The matrix is:\n\n```\n7 1 8 7 3 7 5 5\n6 1 2 0 4 8 3 4\n3 0 4 5 6 3 8 1\n6 7 9 8 2 7 7 2\n4 7 8 7 8 2 6 3\n0 8 4 0 5 9 4 2\n3 8 4 9 7 3 1 5\n6 6 4 3 2 2 3 1\n```\n\nThe approach to solve this is:\n1. Start from the top-left corner and move right until the end of the row.\n2. Move down the last column.\n3. Move left on the bottom row.\n4. Move up the first column.\n5. Repeat the process for the inner sub-matrix.\n\nWe will implement this logic in Python to generate the spiral order of the matrix.\n\n```python\ndef spiral_order(matrix):\n    if not matrix:\n        return []\n\n    result = []\n    while matrix:\n        # Take the first row\n        result += matrix.pop(0)\n        # Take the last element of each remaining row\n        if matrix and matrix[0]:\n            for row in matrix:\n                result.append(row.pop())\n        # Take the last row in reverse order\n        if matrix:\n            result += matrix.pop()[::-1]\n        # Take the first element of each remaining row in reverse order\n        if matrix and matrix[0]:\n            for row in matrix[::-1]:\n                result.append(row.pop(0))\n    return result\n\nmatrix = [\n    [7, 1, 8, 7, 3, 7, 5, 5],\n    [6, 1, 2, 0, 4, 8, 3, 4],\n    [3, 0, 4, 5, 6, 3, 8, 1],\n    [6, 7, 9, 8, 2, 7, 7, 2],\n    [4, 7, 8, 7, 8, 2, 6, 3],\n    [0, 8, 4, 0, 5, 9, 4, 2],\n    [3, 8, 4, 9, 7, 3, 1, 5],\n    [6, 6, 4, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1]\n]\n\nspiral = spiral_order(matrix)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, spiral)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the elements of the matrix in spiral order. Let's execute it to get the result.",

The output is:\n\n```\n<<<7 1 8 7 3 7 5 5 4 1 2 3 2 5 1 3 2 2 3 4 6 6 3 0 4 6 3 6 1 2 0 4 8 3 8 7 6 4 1 3 7 9 4 8 8 7 7 0 4 5 6 3 7 2 9 5 0 4 8 9 8 2 8 7>>>\n```\n\nThis is the list of elements in spiral order for the given matrix.
