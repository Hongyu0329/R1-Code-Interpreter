    "To solve this problem, we need to traverse the given matrix in a spiral order. The matrix is a 10x10 grid, and we need to extract the elements in a specific order: starting from the top-left corner, moving right, then down, then left, and then up, repeating this process for the inner layers of the matrix.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Initialize boundaries for the top, bottom, left, and right of the matrix.\n2. Use a loop to traverse the matrix in a spiral order:\n   - Traverse from left to right across the top boundary.\n   - Traverse from top to bottom along the right boundary.\n   - Traverse from right to left across the bottom boundary, if the top and bottom boundaries haven't crossed.\n   - Traverse from bottom to top along the left boundary, if the left and right boundaries haven't crossed.\n3. After traversing each boundary, adjust the boundaries inward.\n4. Continue the process until all elements are visited.\n5. Collect the elements in a list and format them as a space-separated string.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the spiral order of the matrix.\n\n```python\ndef spiral_order(matrix):\n    if not matrix:\n        return []\n\n    result = []\n    top, bottom = 0, len(matrix) - 1\n    left, right = 0, len(matrix[0]) - 1\n\n    while top <= bottom and left <= right:\n        # Traverse from left to right along the top boundary\n        for i in range(left, right + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[top][i])\n        top += 1\n\n        # Traverse from top to bottom along the right boundary\n        for i in range(top, bottom + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[i][right])\n        right -= 1\n\n        if top <= bottom:\n            # Traverse from right to left along the bottom boundary\n            for i in range(right, left - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[bottom][i])\n            bottom -= 1\n\n        if left <= right:\n            # Traverse from bottom to top along the left boundary\n            for i in range(bottom, top - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[i][left])\n            left += 1\n\n    return result\n\nmatrix = [\n    [6, 7, 1, 9, 6, 1, 7, 6, 8, 6],\n    [1, 0, 5, 8, 1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 7],\n    [9, 9, 6, 5, 7, 5, 3, 3, 2, 1],\n    [2, 9, 1, 0, 9, 0, 7, 6, 7, 7],\n    [6, 3, 8, 4, 4, 6, 5, 5, 1, 2],\n    [1, 0, 5, 5, 9, 8, 4, 0, 2, 1],\n    [5, 8, 2, 3, 3, 7, 9, 7, 6, 3],\n    [9, 4, 4, 9, 5, 6, 2, 3, 5, 1],\n    [7, 2, 1, 9, 5, 9, 9, 7, 3, 6],\n    [3, 0, 7, 1, 9, 6, 4, 0, 8, 7]\n]\n\nspiral = spiral_order(matrix)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, spiral)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the elements of the matrix in spiral order. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the spiral order of the matrix. However, it seems there was an error in the output format. The spiral order should be a continuous sequence of numbers without any interruptions or errors. Let's verify the output and ensure it matches the expected spiral order.\n\nThe output is:\n```\n<<<6 7 1 9 6 1 7 6 8 6 7 1 7 2 1 3 1 6 7 8 0 4 6 9 1 7 0 3 7 9 5 1 6 2 9 1 0 5 8 1 2 4 3 5 2 7 1 2 6 5 3 7 9 9 5 9 1 2 4 8 0 3 9 9 6 5 7 5 3 3 6 5 0 7 3 2 6 5 9 4 2 5 8 1 0 9 0 7 5 4 9 7 3 3 5 4 4 6 8 9>>>\n```\n\nThis output is correct and represents the elements of the matrix in spiral order. There are no errors in the output format, and the sequence is continuous as expected.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<6 7 1 9 6 1 7 6 8 6 7 1 7 2 1 3 1 6 7 8 0 4 6 9 1 7 0 3 7 9 5 1 6 2 9 1 0 5 8 1 2 4 3 5 2 7 1 2 6 5 3 7 9 9 5 9 1 2 4 8 0 3 9 9 6 5 7 5 3 3 6 5 0 7 3 2 6 5 9 4 2 5 8 1 0 9 0 7 5 4 9 7 3 3 5 4 4 6 8 9>>>"
