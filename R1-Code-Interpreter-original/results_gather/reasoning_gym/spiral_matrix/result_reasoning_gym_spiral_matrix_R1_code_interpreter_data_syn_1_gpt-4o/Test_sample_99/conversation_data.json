  "question": "Given a matrix, your job is to generate a list of elements in spiral order, starting from the top-left element.\n\nThe spiral order is clockwise, starting from the top-left corner. More precisely:\n- Start from the top-left corner and move right.\n- Move down towards the bottom-right corner.\n- Move left towards the bottom-left corner.\n- Move up towards the top-right corner.\n- Repeat the steps for the inner elements of the matrix until every entry is visited.\n\nYour output should be a space-separated list of integers enclosed within triple angle brackets, e.g. <<<1 2 3 4 5 6>>>\n\nFor the matrix below, what is the list of elements in spiral order?\n7 7 7 6 8 6 6\n3 9 0 1 0 6 7\n1 3 2 8 1 9 3\n0 1 1 8 8 1 5\n7 3 9 5 1 1 2\n6 9 2 9 2 2 4\n2 9 0 5 5 3 4\n",

    "To solve this problem, we need to traverse the given matrix in a spiral order. The matrix is:\n\n```\n7 7 7 6 8 6 6\n3 9 0 1 0 6 7\n1 3 2 8 1 9 3\n0 1 1 8 8 1 5\n7 3 9 5 1 1 2\n6 9 2 9 2 2 4\n2 9 0 5 5 3 4\n```\n\nThe approach to solve this problem involves:\n1. Initializing boundaries for the rows and columns.\n2. Iteratively traversing the matrix in a spiral manner:\n   - Traverse from left to right across the top row.\n   - Traverse downwards along the right column.\n   - Traverse from right to left across the bottom row.\n   - Traverse upwards along the left column.\n3. Adjust the boundaries after each traversal to move inward.\n4. Continue the process until all elements are visited.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to get the spiral order of the matrix.\n\n```python\ndef spiral_order(matrix):\n    if not matrix:\n        return []\n\n    result = []\n    top, bottom = 0, len(matrix) - 1\n    left, right = 0, len(matrix[0]) - 1\n\n    while top <= bottom and left <= right:\n        # Traverse from left to right across the top row\n        for i in range(left, right + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[top][i])\n        top += 1\n\n        # Traverse downwards along the right column\n        for i in range(top, bottom + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[i][right])\n        right -= 1\n\n        if top <= bottom:\n            # Traverse from right to left across the bottom row\n            for i in range(right, left - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[bottom][i])\n            bottom -= 1\n\n        if left <= right:\n            # Traverse upwards along the left column\n            for i in range(bottom, top - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[i][left])\n            left += 1\n\n    return result\n\nmatrix = [\n    [7, 7, 7, 6, 8, 6, 6],\n    [3, 9, 0, 1, 0, 6, 7],\n    [1, 3, 2, 8, 1, 9, 3],\n    [0, 1, 1, 8, 8, 1, 5],\n    [7, 3, 9, 5, 1, 1, 2],\n    [6, 9, 2, 9, 2, 2, 4],\n    [2, 9, 0, 5, 5, 3, 4]\n]\n\nspiral = spiral_order(matrix)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, spiral)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will compute the spiral order of the matrix and print it in the required format.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the spiral order of the matrix as expected. The output is:\n\n```\n<<<7 7 7 6 8 6 6 7 3 5 2 4 4 3 5 5 0 9 2 6 7 0 1 3 9 0 1 0 6 9 1 1 2 2 9 2 9 3 1 3 2 8 1 8 1 5 9 1 8>>>\n```\n\nThis output represents the elements of the matrix traversed in a spiral order, starting from the top-left corner and moving clockwise. The code correctly implements the logic to traverse the matrix in a spiral pattern and outputs the result in the specified format. \n\nIf you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!"
