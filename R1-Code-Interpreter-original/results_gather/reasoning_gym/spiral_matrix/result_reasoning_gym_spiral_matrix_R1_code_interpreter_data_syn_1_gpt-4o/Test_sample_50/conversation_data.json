    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from a given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach to traverse the matrix in a spiral pattern. The matrix provided is:\n\n```\n3 2 2 4\n2 7 6 7\n4 8 1 4\n9 8 0 2\n```\n\nThis matrix can be represented as a 2D list in Python:\n\n```python\nmatrix = [\n    [3, 2, 2, 4],\n    [2, 7, 6, 7],\n    [4, 8, 1, 4],\n    [9, 8, 0, 2]\n]\n```\n\nThe spiral order traversal involves:\n1. Traversing the top row from left to right.\n2. Traversing the right column from top to bottom.\n3. Traversing the bottom row from right to left.\n4. Traversing the left column from bottom to top.\n5. Repeating the above steps for the inner sub-matrix.\n\nWe will implement this logic in Python to extract the elements in spiral order.\n\n```python\ndef spiral_order(matrix):\n    if not matrix:\n        return []\n\n    result = []\n    while matrix:\n        # Take the first row\n        result += matrix.pop(0)\n        # Take the right column\n        if matrix and matrix[0]:\n            for row in matrix:\n                result.append(row.pop())\n        # Take the bottom row\n        if matrix:\n            result += matrix.pop()[::-1]\n        # Take the left column\n        if matrix and matrix[0]:\n            for row in matrix[::-1]:\n                result.append(row.pop(0))\n    return result\n\nmatrix = [\n    [3, 2, 2, 4],\n    [2, 7, 6, 7],\n    [4, 8, 1, 4],\n    [9, 8, 0, 2]\n]\n\nspiral_elements = spiral_order(matrix)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, spiral_elements)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the elements of the matrix in spiral order. Let's execute it to get the result."
