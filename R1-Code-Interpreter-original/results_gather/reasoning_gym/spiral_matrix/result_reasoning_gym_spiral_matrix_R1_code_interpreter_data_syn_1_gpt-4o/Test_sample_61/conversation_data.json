    "To solve this problem, we need to traverse the given matrix in a spiral order. The matrix is a 9x9 grid, and we will start from the top-left corner and move in a clockwise spiral pattern. The steps are as follows:\n\n1. Traverse from left to right across the top row.\n2. Traverse down the rightmost column.\n3. Traverse from right to left across the bottom row.\n4. Traverse up the leftmost column.\n5. Repeat the process for the inner sub-matrix.\n\nWe will continue this process until all elements are visited. Let's implement this logic in Python to generate the spiral order of the matrix.\n\n```python\ndef spiral_order(matrix):\n    if not matrix:\n        return []\n\n    result = []\n    while matrix:\n        # Take the first row\n        result += matrix.pop(0)\n        # Take the last element of each remaining row\n        if matrix and matrix[0]:\n            for row in matrix:\n                result.append(row.pop())\n        # Take the last row in reverse order\n        if matrix:\n            result += matrix.pop()[::-1]\n        # Take the first element of each remaining row (in reverse order)\n        if matrix and matrix[0]:\n            for row in matrix[::-1]:\n                result.append(row.pop(0))\n    return result\n\nmatrix = [\n    [9, 2, 1, 7, 0, 5, 3, 2, 4],\n    [9, 1, 8, 3, 6, 1, 0, 5, 4],\n    [2, 0, 0, 4, 8, 6, 0, 9, 9],\n    [4, 9, 1, 8, 8, 6, 0, 1, 7],\n    [9, 1, 4, 1, 1, 8, 5, 6, 1],\n    [1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 8, 7, 9, 1],\n    [0, 9, 9, 8, 1, 6, 9, 1, 1],\n    [6, 3, 2, 7, 2, 8, 0, 2, 8],\n    [4, 0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 2, 5, 2]\n]\n\nspiral = spiral_order(matrix)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, spiral)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the elements of the matrix in spiral order. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the spiral order of the matrix as expected. The output is a space-separated list of integers enclosed within triple angle brackets, which matches the required format. \n\nThe spiral order traversal of the given matrix is:\n\n<<<9 2 1 7 0 5 3 2 4 4 9 7 1 1 1 8 2 5 2 9 5 3 2 0 4 6 0 1 9 4 2 9 1 8 3 6 1 0 5 9 1 6 9 1 2 0 8 2 7 2 3 9 3 1 9 0 0 4 8 6 0 0 5 7 9 6 1 8 9 5 4 1 8 8 6 8 8 2 7 1 1>>>\n\nThis is the final answer."
