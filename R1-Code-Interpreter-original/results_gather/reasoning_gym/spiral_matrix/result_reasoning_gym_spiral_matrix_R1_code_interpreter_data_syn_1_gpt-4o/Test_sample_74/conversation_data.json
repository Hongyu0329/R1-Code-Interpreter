    "To solve this problem, we need to traverse the given matrix in a spiral order. The matrix is a 9x9 grid, and we will start from the top-left corner and move in a clockwise spiral pattern until all elements are visited.\n\nThe steps to achieve this are:\n1. Start from the top-left corner and move right across the top row.\n2. Move down the last column.\n3. Move left across the bottom row.\n4. Move up the first column.\n5. Repeat the above steps for the inner sub-matrix until all elements are visited.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to generate the spiral order of the matrix.\n\n```python\ndef spiral_order(matrix):\n    if not matrix:\n        return []\n\n    result = []\n    while matrix:\n        # Take the first row\n        result += matrix.pop(0)\n        # Take the last element of each remaining row\n        if matrix and matrix[0]:\n            for row in matrix:\n                result.append(row.pop())\n        # Take the last row in reverse order\n        if matrix:\n            result += matrix.pop()[::-1]\n        # Take the first element of each remaining row (in reverse order)\n        if matrix and matrix[0]:\n            for row in matrix[::-1]:\n                result.append(row.pop(0))\n    return result\n\nmatrix = [\n    [6, 5, 4, 4, 1, 2, 2, 9, 3],\n    [3, 5, 5, 4, 5, 2, 8, 7, 1],\n    [8, 3, 5, 5, 7, 8, 0, 4, 7],\n    [7, 3, 2, 5, 3, 5, 5, 5, 8],\n    [6, 4, 3, 0, 2, 2, 8, 9, 2],\n    [3, 6, 4, 1, 7, 0, 6, 7, 1],\n    [2, 7, 4, 3, 3, 1, 0, 6, 9],\n    [7, 5, 7, 2, 2, 7, 5, 8, 2],\n    [8, 8, 2, 6, 8, 9, 6, 4, 7]\n]\n\nspiral = spiral_order(matrix)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, spiral)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the elements of the matrix in spiral order.
