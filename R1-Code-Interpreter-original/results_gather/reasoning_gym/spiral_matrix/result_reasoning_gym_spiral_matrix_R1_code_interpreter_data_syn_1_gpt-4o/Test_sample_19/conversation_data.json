    "To solve this problem, we need to traverse the given matrix in a spiral order. The matrix is:\n\n```\n5 6 8 0 8\n3 3 6 0 8\n7 4 6 2 9\n0 8 4 5 4\n7 1 8 8 8\n```\n\nThe spiral order traversal involves the following steps:\n1. Traverse the first row from left to right.\n2. Traverse the last column from top to bottom.\n3. Traverse the last row from right to left.\n4. Traverse the first column from bottom to top.\n5. Repeat the process for the inner sub-matrix.\n\nWe will implement this logic in Python to generate the spiral order of the matrix.\n\n```python\ndef spiral_order(matrix):\n    if not matrix:\n        return []\n\n    result = []\n    while matrix:\n        # Add the first row\n        result += matrix.pop(0)\n        # Add the last column\n        if matrix and matrix[0]:\n            for row in matrix:\n                result.append(row.pop())\n        # Add the last row\n        if matrix:\n            result += matrix.pop()[::-1]\n        # Add the first column\n        if matrix and matrix[0]:\n            for row in matrix[::-1]:\n                result.append(row.pop(0))\n    return result\n\nmatrix = [\n    [5, 6, 8, 0, 8],\n    [3, 3, 6, 0, 8],\n    [7, 4, 6, 2, 9],\n    [0, 8, 4, 5, 4],\n    [7, 1, 8, 8, 8]\n]\n\nspiral = spiral_order(matrix)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, spiral)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the elements of the matrix in spiral order. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the spiral order of the matrix as:\n\n<<<5 6 8 0 8 8 9 4 8 8 8 1 7 0 7 3 3 6 0 2 5 4 8 4 6>>>\n\nThis is the correct spiral order traversal of the given matrix."
