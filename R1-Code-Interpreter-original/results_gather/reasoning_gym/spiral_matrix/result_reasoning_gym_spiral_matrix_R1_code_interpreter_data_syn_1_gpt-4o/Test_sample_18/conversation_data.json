    "To solve this problem, we need to traverse the given matrix in a spiral order. The matrix is a 9x9 grid, and we need to extract the elements in a specific order: starting from the top-left corner, moving right, then down, then left, and then up, repeating this process for the inner layers of the matrix.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Initialize boundaries for the rows and columns. These boundaries will help us keep track of the current layer of the spiral.\n2. Use a loop to traverse the matrix in a spiral order:\n   - Traverse from left to right across the top row.\n   - Traverse down the rightmost column.\n   - Traverse from right to left across the bottom row.\n   - Traverse up the leftmost column.\n3. After completing a full spiral loop, adjust the boundaries inward and repeat the process for the next inner layer.\n4. Continue this process until all elements are visited.\n5. Collect the elements in the order they are visited and format them as a space-separated list.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the spiral order of the given matrix.\n\n```python\ndef spiral_order(matrix):\n    if not matrix:\n        return []\n\n    result = []\n    top, bottom = 0, len(matrix) - 1\n    left, right = 0, len(matrix[0]) - 1\n\n    while top <= bottom and left <= right:\n        # Traverse from left to right across the top row\n        for i in range(left, right + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[top][i])\n        top += 1\n\n        # Traverse down the rightmost column\n        for i in range(top, bottom + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[i][right])\n        right -= 1\n\n        if top <= bottom:\n            # Traverse from right to left across the bottom row\n            for i in range(right, left - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[bottom][i])\n            bottom -= 1\n\n        if left <= right:\n            # Traverse up the leftmost column\n            for i in range(bottom, top - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[i][left])\n            left += 1\n\n    return result\n\nmatrix = [\n    [5, 9, 9, 9, 2, 3, 5, 3, 0],\n    [8, 5, 9, 7, 1, 1, 2, 9, 8],\n    [1, 9, 6, 5, 3, 1, 5, 2, 2],\n    [1, 7, 6, 3, 8, 7, 7, 9, 5],\n    [8, 7, 0, 9, 4, 1, 8, 5, 5],\n    [6, 0, 8, 1, 4, 3, 8, 9, 3],\n    [6, 2, 9, 5, 4, 4, 4, 3, 0],\n    [3, 3, 8, 6, 5, 6, 2, 5, 7],\n    [4, 1, 1, 8, 6, 1, 5, 1, 8]\n]\n\nspiral_result = spiral_order(matrix)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, spiral_result)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will compute the spiral order of the matrix and print the result in the required format.",
