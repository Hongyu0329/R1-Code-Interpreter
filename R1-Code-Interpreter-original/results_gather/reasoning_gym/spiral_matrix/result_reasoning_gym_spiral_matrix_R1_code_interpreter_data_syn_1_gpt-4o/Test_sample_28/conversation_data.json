    "To solve this problem, we need to traverse the given matrix in a spiral order. The matrix is:\n\n```\n8 7 4 2 2 5\n9 4 1 4 2 1\n9 0 9 6 2 4\n2 6 4 9 2 9\n9 7 0 0 9 8\n0 3 3 2 3 0\n```\n\nThe dimensions of the matrix are 6 rows by 6 columns. The spiral order traversal involves:\n\n1. Moving right across the top row.\n2. Moving down the last column.\n3. Moving left across the bottom row.\n4. Moving up the first column.\n5. Repeating the process for the inner sub-matrix.\n\nWe will implement this logic in Python to generate the spiral order of the matrix.\n\n```python\ndef spiral_order(matrix):\n    if not matrix:\n        return []\n\n    result = []\n    top, bottom = 0, len(matrix) - 1\n    left, right = 0, len(matrix[0]) - 1\n\n    while top <= bottom and left <= right:\n        # Traverse from left to right\n        for i in range(left, right + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[top][i])\n        top += 1\n\n        # Traverse downwards\n        for i in range(top, bottom + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[i][right])\n        right -= 1\n\n        if top <= bottom:\n            # Traverse from right to left\n            for i in range(right, left - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[bottom][i])\n            bottom -= 1\n\n        if left <= right:\n            # Traverse upwards\n            for i in range(bottom, top - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[i][left])\n            left += 1\n\n    return result\n\nmatrix = [\n    [8, 7, 4, 2, 2, 5],\n    [9, 4, 1, 4, 2, 1],\n    [9, 0, 9, 6, 2, 4],\n    [2, 6, 4, 9, 2, 9],\n    [9, 7, 0, 0, 9, 8],\n    [0, 3, 3, 2, 3, 0]\n]\n\nspiral = spiral_order(matrix)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, spiral)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the elements of the matrix in spiral order.
