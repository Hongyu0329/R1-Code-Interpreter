    "To solve this problem, we need to traverse the given matrix in a spiral order. The matrix is provided as a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row of the matrix. The spiral order traversal involves moving right across the top row, then down the rightmost column, then left across the bottom row, and finally up the leftmost column. This process is repeated for the inner sub-matrix until all elements are visited.\n\nLet's break down the steps to achieve this:\n\n1. Initialize boundaries for the top, bottom, left, and right of the matrix.\n2. Traverse the matrix in a spiral order:\n   - Move from left to right across the top boundary and then increment the top boundary.\n   - Move from top to bottom down the right boundary and then decrement the right boundary.\n   - Move from right to left across the bottom boundary and then decrement the bottom boundary.\n   - Move from bottom to top up the left boundary and then increment the left boundary.\n3. Continue this process until the top boundary exceeds the bottom boundary or the left boundary exceeds the right boundary.\n4. Collect the elements in the order they are visited.\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in Python to compute the spiral order of the given matrix.\n\n```python\ndef spiral_order(matrix):\n    if not matrix:\n        return []\n\n    top, bottom = 0, len(matrix) - 1\n    left, right = 0, len(matrix[0]) - 1\n    result = []\n\n    while top <= bottom and left <= right:\n        # Traverse from left to right across the top row\n        for i in range(left, right + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[top][i])\n        top += 1\n\n        # Traverse from top to bottom down the right column\n        for i in range(top, bottom + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[i][right])\n        right -= 1\n\n        if top <= bottom:\n            # Traverse from right to left across the bottom row\n            for i in range(right, left - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[bottom][i])\n            bottom -= 1\n\n        if left <= right:\n            # Traverse from bottom to top up the left column\n            for i in range(bottom, top - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[i][left])\n            left += 1\n\n    return result\n\nmatrix = [\n    [9, 5, 1, 5, 9, 9, 9, 8],\n    [6, 4, 5, 4, 3, 6, 5, 6],\n    [7, 2, 6, 1, 4, 0, 2, 4],\n    [1, 6, 8, 3, 7, 2, 2, 1],\n    [1, 6, 7, 0, 4, 2, 4, 5],\n    [8, 0, 3, 2, 9, 1, 1, 8],\n    [7, 4, 8, 5, 1, 7, 2, 7],\n    [7, 4, 5, 3, 9, 6, 9, 5]\n]\n\nresult = spiral_order(matrix)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, result)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will compute the spiral order of the given matrix and print the result in the required format.",
