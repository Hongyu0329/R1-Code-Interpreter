    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from a given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach to traverse the matrix in a spiral pattern. The matrix provided is:\n\n```\n8 0\n4 7\n```\n\nThis is a 2x2 matrix. The spiral order traversal for this matrix would involve the following steps:\n\n1. Start from the top-left corner and move right across the first row.\n2. Move down the last column.\n3. Move left across the bottom row.\n4. Move up the first column.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to generate the spiral order of the given matrix.\n\n```python\ndef spiral_order(matrix):\n    if not matrix:\n        return []\n\n    result = []\n    top, bottom = 0, len(matrix) - 1\n    left, right = 0, len(matrix[0]) - 1\n\n    while top <= bottom and left <= right:\n        # Traverse from left to right across the top row\n        for i in range(left, right + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[top][i])\n        top += 1\n\n        # Traverse from top to bottom down the right column\n        for i in range(top, bottom + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[i][right])\n        right -= 1\n\n        if top <= bottom:\n            # Traverse from right to left across the bottom row\n            for i in range(right, left - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[bottom][i])\n            bottom -= 1\n\n        if left <= right:\n            # Traverse from bottom to top up the left column\n            for i in range(bottom, top - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[i][left])\n            left += 1\n\n    return result\n\nmatrix = [\n    [8, 0],\n    [4, 7]\n]\n\nspiral_result = spiral_order(matrix)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, spiral_result)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will compute the spiral order of the given matrix and print the result in the required format.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the spiral order of the given matrix as expected. The output is:\n\n```\n<<<8 0 7 4>>>\n```\n\nThis output represents the elements of the matrix traversed in a spiral order starting from the top-left corner. The steps followed were:\n\n1. Start at the top-left corner (8) and move right to (0).\n2. Move down to the bottom-right corner (7).\n3. Move left to the bottom-left corner (4).\n\nThe traversal is complete as all elements have been visited. \n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<8 0 7 4>>>"
