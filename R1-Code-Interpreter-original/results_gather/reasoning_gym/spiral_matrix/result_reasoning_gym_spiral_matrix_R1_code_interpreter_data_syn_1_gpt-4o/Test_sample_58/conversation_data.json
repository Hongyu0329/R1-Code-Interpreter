    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from a given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach to traverse the matrix in a spiral pattern. The matrix provided is:\n\n```\n5 5 9 4 4\n8 1 8 2 5\n4 8 2 6 7\n7 1 7 4 0\n9 1 9 2 7\n```\n\nThe steps to achieve the spiral order are as follows:\n\n1. Start from the top-left corner and move right across the first row.\n2. Move down the last column.\n3. Move left across the bottom row.\n4. Move up the first column.\n5. Repeat the process for the inner sub-matrix until all elements are visited.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the spiral order of the matrix.\n\n```python\ndef spiral_order(matrix):\n    if not matrix:\n        return []\n\n    result = []\n    while matrix:\n        # Take the first row\n        result += matrix.pop(0)\n        # Take the last element of each remaining row\n        if matrix and matrix[0]:\n            for row in matrix:\n                result.append(row.pop())\n        # Take the last row in reverse order\n        if matrix:\n            result += matrix.pop()[::-1]\n        # Take the first element of each remaining row in reverse order\n        if matrix and matrix[0]:\n            for row in matrix[::-1]:\n                result.append(row.pop(0))\n    return result\n\nmatrix = [\n    [5, 5, 9, 4, 4],\n    [8, 1, 8, 2, 5],\n    [4, 8, 2, 6, 7],\n    [7, 1, 7, 4, 0],\n    [9, 1, 9, 2, 7]\n]\n\nspiral = spiral_order(matrix)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, spiral)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will compute the spiral order of the given matrix and print the result in the required format.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the spiral order of the matrix as expected. The output is:\n\n<<<5 5 9 4 4 5 7 0 7 2 9 1 9 7 4 8 1 8 2 6 4 7 1 8 2>>>\n\nThis output represents the elements of the matrix traversed in a spiral order starting from the top-left corner."
