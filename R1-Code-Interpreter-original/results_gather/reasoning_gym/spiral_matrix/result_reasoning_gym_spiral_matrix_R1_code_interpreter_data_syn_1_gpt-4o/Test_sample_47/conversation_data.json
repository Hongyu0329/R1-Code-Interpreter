    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from a given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach to traverse the matrix in a spiral pattern. Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Initialize Boundaries**: We need to keep track of the boundaries of the matrix that we haven't traversed yet. These boundaries are `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.\n\n2. **Traverse the Matrix**: We will traverse the matrix in a spiral order by:\n   - Moving from left to right across the top row.\n   - Moving from top to bottom down the right column.\n   - Moving from right to left across the bottom row.\n   - Moving from bottom to top up the left column.\n   - After completing a full spiral, we will adjust the boundaries inward and repeat the process for the inner sub-matrix.\n\n3. **Stop Condition**: The process continues until the `top` boundary exceeds the `bottom` boundary or the `left` boundary exceeds the `right` boundary, indicating that all elements have been visited.\n\n4. **Output**: Collect the elements in the order they are visited and format them as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the spiral order of the given matrix.\n\n```python\ndef spiral_order(matrix):\n    if not matrix:\n        return []\n    \n    top, bottom = 0, len(matrix) - 1\n    left, right = 0, len(matrix[0]) - 1\n    result = []\n    \n    while top <= bottom and left <= right:\n        # Traverse from left to right across the top row\n        for i in range(left, right + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[top][i])\n        top += 1\n        \n        # Traverse from top to bottom down the right column\n        for i in range(top, bottom + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[i][right])\n        right -= 1\n        \n        if top <= bottom:\n            # Traverse from right to left across the bottom row\n            for i in range(right, left - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[bottom][i])\n            bottom -= 1\n        \n        if left <= right:\n            # Traverse from bottom to top up the left column\n            for i in range(bottom, top - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[i][left])\n            left += 1\n    \n    return result\n\n# Given matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [3, 4, 1, 1],\n    [7, 2, 9, 0],\n    [7, 5, 5, 3],\n    [3, 2, 2, 7]\n]\n\n# Get the spiral order\nspiral_list = spiral_order(matrix)\n\n# Format the output\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, spiral_list)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will compute the spiral order of the given matrix and format the output as required.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the spiral order of the given matrix. The output is formatted as a space-separated list of integers enclosed within triple angle brackets, as required.\n\nThe spiral order of the matrix is:\n- Start from the top-left corner and move right: 3, 4, 1, 1\n- Move down the right column: 0, 3\n- Move left across the bottom row: 7, 2\n- Move up the left column: 2, 3\n- Continue the spiral for the inner sub-matrix: 7, 7, 2, 9\n- Move down the right column: 5\n- Move left across the bottom row: 5\n\nThus, the final spiral order is: <<<3 4 1 1 0 3 7 2 2 3 7 7 2 9 5 5>>>"
