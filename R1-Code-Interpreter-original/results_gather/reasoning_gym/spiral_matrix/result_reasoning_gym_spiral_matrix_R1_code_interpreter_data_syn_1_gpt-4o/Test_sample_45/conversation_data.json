    "To solve this problem, we need to traverse the given matrix in a spiral order. The matrix is:\n\n```\n7 5 3 4 8 1\n0 1 6 7 3 3\n8 8 3 3 8 2\n5 1 9 8 2 1\n4 3 3 3 4 2\n5 0 7 1 8 3\n```\n\nThe dimensions of the matrix are 6 rows by 6 columns. The spiral order traversal involves the following steps:\n\n1. Traverse the top row from left to right.\n2. Traverse the rightmost column from top to bottom.\n3. Traverse the bottom row from right to left.\n4. Traverse the leftmost column from bottom to top.\n5. Repeat the process for the inner sub-matrix.\n\nWe will implement this logic in Python to generate the spiral order of the matrix.\n\n```python\ndef spiral_order(matrix):\n    if not matrix:\n        return []\n\n    result = []\n    top, bottom = 0, len(matrix) - 1\n    left, right = 0, len(matrix[0]) - 1\n\n    while top <= bottom and left <= right:\n        # Traverse from left to right along the top row\n        for i in range(left, right + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[top][i])\n        top += 1\n\n        # Traverse from top to bottom along the right column\n        for i in range(top, bottom + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[i][right])\n        right -= 1\n\n        if top <= bottom:\n            # Traverse from right to left along the bottom row\n            for i in range(right, left - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[bottom][i])\n            bottom -= 1\n\n        if left <= right:\n            # Traverse from bottom to top along the left column\n            for i in range(bottom, top - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[i][left])\n            left += 1\n\n    return result\n\nmatrix = [\n    [7, 5, 3, 4, 8, 1],\n    [0, 1, 6, 7, 3, 3],\n    [8, 8, 3, 3, 8, 2],\n    [5, 1, 9, 8, 2, 1],\n    [4, 3, 3, 3, 4, 2],\n    [5, 0, 7, 1, 8, 3]\n]\n\nspiral = spiral_order(matrix)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, spiral)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the elements of the matrix in spiral order.
