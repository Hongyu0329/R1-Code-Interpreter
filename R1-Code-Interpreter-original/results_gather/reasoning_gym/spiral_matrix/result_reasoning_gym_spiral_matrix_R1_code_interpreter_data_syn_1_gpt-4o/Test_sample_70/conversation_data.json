    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from a given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach to traverse the matrix in a spiral pattern. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Initialize Boundaries**: We need to keep track of the boundaries of the matrix that we haven't yet traversed. These include `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.\n\n2. **Traverse the Matrix**: We will traverse the matrix in a loop, adjusting the boundaries as we go:\n   - Traverse from left to right across the top row, then move the `top` boundary down.\n   - Traverse from top to bottom along the right column, then move the `right` boundary left.\n   - Traverse from right to left across the bottom row, then move the `bottom` boundary up.\n   - Traverse from bottom to top along the left column, then move the `left` boundary right.\n\n3. **Check for Completion**: Continue the process until the `top` boundary exceeds the `bottom` boundary or the `left` boundary exceeds the `right` boundary, indicating that all elements have been visited.\n\n4. **Output the Result**: Collect the elements in the order they are visited and output them as a space-separated list.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the spiral order of the given matrix.\n\n```python\ndef spiral_order(matrix):\n    if not matrix or not matrix[0]:\n        return []\n\n    top, bottom = 0, len(matrix) - 1\n    left, right = 0, len(matrix[0]) - 1\n    result = []\n\n    while top <= bottom and left <= right:\n        # Traverse from left to right along the top row\n        for i in range(left, right + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[top][i])\n        top += 1\n\n        # Traverse from top to bottom along the right column\n        for i in range(top, bottom + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[i][right])\n        right -= 1\n\n        if top <= bottom:\n            # Traverse from right to left along the bottom row\n            for i in range(right, left - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[bottom][i])\n            bottom -= 1\n\n        if left <= right:\n            # Traverse from bottom to top along the left column\n            for i in range(bottom, top - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[i][left])\n            left += 1\n\n    return result\n\n# Given matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [9, 9, 6, 9],\n    [8, 9, 8, 5],\n    [2, 9, 8, 4],\n    [6, 0, 9, 2]\n]\n\n# Get the spiral order\nspiral_result = spiral_order(matrix)\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, spiral_result)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will compute the spiral order of the given matrix and print it in the specified format.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the spiral order of the given matrix. The output is:\n\n<<<9 9 6 9 5 4 2 9 0 6 2 8 9 8 8 9>>>\n\nThis output represents the elements of the matrix traversed in a spiral order, starting from the top-left corner and moving clockwise."
