    "To solve this problem, we need to traverse the given matrix in a spiral order. The matrix is a 7x7 grid, and we need to extract the elements in a specific order: starting from the top-left corner, moving right, then down, then left, and then up, repeating this process for the inner layers of the matrix.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Initialize boundaries**: We need to keep track of the boundaries of the matrix that we haven't yet traversed. These boundaries are `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.\n\n2. **Traverse the matrix**: We will use a loop to traverse the matrix in a spiral order:\n   - Move from left to right across the top boundary.\n   - Move from top to bottom along the right boundary.\n   - Move from right to left across the bottom boundary.\n   - Move from bottom to top along the left boundary.\n   - After completing a full spiral, we adjust the boundaries inward and repeat the process for the next inner layer.\n\n3. **Stop condition**: The process stops when the `top` boundary exceeds the `bottom` boundary or the `left` boundary exceeds the `right` boundary, indicating that all elements have been visited.\n\n4. **Output the result**: Collect the elements in the order they are visited and output them as a space-separated list.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python code to compute the spiral order of the given matrix.\n\n```python\ndef spiral_order(matrix):\n    if not matrix:\n        return []\n\n    result = []\n    top, bottom = 0, len(matrix) - 1\n    left, right = 0, len(matrix[0]) - 1\n\n    while top <= bottom and left <= right:\n        # Traverse from left to right along the top boundary\n        for i in range(left, right + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[top][i])\n        top += 1\n\n        # Traverse from top to bottom along the right boundary\n        for i in range(top, bottom + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[i][right])\n        right -= 1\n\n        if top <= bottom:\n            # Traverse from right to left along the bottom boundary\n            for i in range(right, left - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[bottom][i])\n            bottom -= 1\n\n        if left <= right:\n            # Traverse from bottom to top along the left boundary\n            for i in range(bottom, top - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[i][left])\n            left += 1\n\n    return result\n\nmatrix = [\n    [7, 7, 3, 6, 4, 3, 9],\n    [9, 0, 3, 3, 4, 8, 5],\n    [2, 1, 0, 8, 5, 6, 1],\n    [9, 5, 3, 0, 4, 7, 6],\n    [0, 4, 8, 4, 6, 2, 7],\n    [9, 6, 1, 1, 1, 3, 6],\n    [0, 9, 7, 3, 7, 1, 0]\n]\n\nresult = spiral_order(matrix)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, result)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will compute the spiral order of the given matrix and print the result in the required format.",
