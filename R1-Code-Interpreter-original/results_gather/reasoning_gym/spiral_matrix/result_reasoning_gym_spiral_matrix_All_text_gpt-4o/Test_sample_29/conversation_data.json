    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to carefully follow the spiral traversal rules. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 9x9 matrix.\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - Start with four boundaries: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.\n   - Initially, `top = 0`, `bottom = 8`, `left = 0`, and `right = 8`.\n\n3. **Traverse the Matrix in Spiral Order**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row. After traversing, increment `top` by 1.\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column. After traversing, decrement `right` by 1.\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row. After traversing, decrement `bottom` by 1.\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column. After traversing, increment `left` by 1.\n   - Repeat the above steps until `top` exceeds `bottom` or `left` exceeds `right`.\n\n4. **Collect Elements**:\n   - As you traverse, collect the elements in the order they are visited.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Format the collected elements as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- **First Layer**:\n  - Move Right: 7, 2, 5, 5, 4, 6, 2, 3, 7\n  - Move Down: 7, 7, 7, 1, 3, 7, 9, 5\n  - Move Left: 5, 5, 6, 1, 0, 5, 4, 6\n  - Move Up: 2, 2, 6, 1, 4, 0, 6\n\n- **Second Layer**:\n  - Move Right: 2, 4, 8, 3, 9, 8, 2\n  - Move Down: 2, 5, 0, 5, 0\n  - Move Left: 5, 5, 6, 1, 5\n  - Move Up: 5, 8, 9, 5\n\n- **Third Layer**:\n  - Move Right: 8, 6, 1, 9\n  - Move Down: 2, 5\n  - Move Left: 6, 8\n  - Move Up: 9\n\n- **Innermost Element**:\n  - 6\n\nCombining all these elements, the spiral order of the matrix is:\n\n<<<7 2 5 5 4 6 2 3 7 7 7 7 1 3 7 9 5 5 5 6 1 0 5 4 6 2 2 6 1 4 0 6 2 4 8 3 9 8 2 2 5 0 5 0 5 5 6 1 5 5 8 9 5 8 6 1 9 2 5 6 8 9 6>>>"
