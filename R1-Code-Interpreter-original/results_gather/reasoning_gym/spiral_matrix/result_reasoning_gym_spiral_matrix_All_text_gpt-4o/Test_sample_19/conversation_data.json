    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 5x5 matrix:\n     ```\n     5 6 8 0 8\n     3 3 6 0 8\n     7 4 6 2 9\n     0 8 4 5 4\n     7 1 8 8 8\n     ```\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - Start with four boundaries: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.\n   - Initially, `top = 0`, `bottom = 4`, `left = 0`, `right = 4`.\n\n3. **Traverse the Matrix in Spiral Order**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row. Increment `top` after traversing.\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column. Decrement `right` after traversing.\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row. Decrement `bottom` after traversing.\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column. Increment `left` after traversing.\n   - Repeat the above steps until `top` exceeds `bottom` or `left` exceeds `right`.\n\n4. **Collect Elements**:\n   - As you traverse, collect the elements in the order they are visited.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Format the collected elements as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- **Move Right** along the top row: `5 6 8 0 8`\n- **Move Down** along the right column: `8 9 4 8`\n- **Move Left** along the bottom row: `8 8 1 7`\n- **Move Up** along the left column: `0 7 3`\n- **Move Right** along the second row from the top: `3 6 0`\n- **Move Down** along the second column from the right: `2 5`\n- **Move Left** along the second row from the bottom: `4 8`\n- **Move Up** along the second column from the left: `4`\n- **Move Right** along the third row from the top: `6`\n\nThe collected elements in spiral order are: `5 6 8 0 8 8 9 4 8 8 8 1 7 0 7 3 3 6 0 2 5 4 8 4 6`\n\nThe final output is:\n<<<5 6 8 0 8 8 9 4 8 8 8 1 7 0 7 3 3 6 0 2 5 4 8 4 6>>>"
