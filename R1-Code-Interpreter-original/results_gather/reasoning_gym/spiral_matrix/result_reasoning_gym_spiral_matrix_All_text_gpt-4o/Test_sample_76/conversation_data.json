    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to carefully follow the steps outlined for traversing the matrix in a spiral manner. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 4x4 matrix:\n     ```\n     3 3 3 1\n     1 4 8 3\n     1 6 4 5\n     1 2 6 3\n     ```\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - We need to keep track of the boundaries of the matrix as we traverse it in a spiral order.\n   - Start with `top = 0`, `bottom = 3` (last row index), `left = 0`, and `right = 3` (last column index).\n\n3. **Traverse the Matrix in Spiral Order**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from left to right along the top boundary.\n     - Elements: 3, 3, 3, 1\n     - Update `top` boundary: `top = 1`\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from top to bottom along the right boundary.\n     - Elements: 3, 5, 3\n     - Update `right` boundary: `right = 2`\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from right to left along the bottom boundary.\n     - Elements: 6, 2, 1\n     - Update `bottom` boundary: `bottom = 2`\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from bottom to top along the left boundary.\n     - Elements: 1, 1\n     - Update `left` boundary: `left = 1`\n\n4. **Repeat for Inner Matrix**:\n   - Now, the boundaries are `top = 1`, `bottom = 2`, `left = 1`, `right = 2`.\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from left to right along the new top boundary.\n     - Elements: 4, 8\n     - Update `top` boundary: `top = 2`\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from top to bottom along the new right boundary.\n     - Element: 4\n     - Update `right` boundary: `right = 1`\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from right to left along the new bottom boundary.\n     - Element: 6\n     - Update `bottom` boundary: `bottom = 1`\n\n5. **End of Traversal**:\n   - At this point, all elements have been visited, and the spiral order traversal is complete.\n\n6. **Compile the Result**:\n   - The elements collected in spiral order are: 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 5, 3, 6, 2, 1, 1, 4, 8, 4, 6.\n\n7. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final output should be a space-separated list of these elements enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<3 3 3 1 3 5 3 6 2 1 1 4 8 4 6>>>"
