    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to carefully follow the spiral traversal rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: \n   - We have a 5x5 matrix:\n     ```\n     8 0 0 3 7\n     1 4 5 7 5\n     2 5 1 6 1\n     3 4 6 9 8\n     0 0 4 2 0\n     ```\n   - Define boundaries for traversal: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.\n   - Initially, `top = 0`, `bottom = 4`, `left = 0`, `right = 4`.\n\n2. **Spiral Traversal**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row.\n     - Elements: 8, 0, 0, 3, 7\n     - Update `top` to 1.\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column.\n     - Elements: 5, 1, 8, 0\n     - Update `right` to 3.\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row.\n     - Elements: 2, 4, 0\n     - Update `bottom` to 3.\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column.\n     - Elements: 3, 2, 1\n     - Update `left` to 1.\n\n3. **Repeat the Process for Inner Layers**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row.\n     - Elements: 4, 5, 7\n     - Update `top` to 2.\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column.\n     - Elements: 6, 9\n     - Update `right` to 2.\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row.\n     - Elements: 6, 4\n     - Update `bottom` to 2.\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column.\n     - Elements: 5\n     - Update `left` to 2.\n\n4. **Final Element**:\n   - The only remaining element is in the center of the matrix.\n   - Element: 1\n\n5. **Combine All Elements**:\n   - The spiral order of elements is: 8, 0, 0, 3, 7, 5, 1, 8, 0, 2, 4, 0, 3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 7, 6, 9, 6, 4, 5, 1\n\n6. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final output should be a space-separated list of these elements enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<8 0 0 3 7 5 1 8 0 2 4 0 3 2 1 4 5 7 6 9 6 4 5 1>>>"
