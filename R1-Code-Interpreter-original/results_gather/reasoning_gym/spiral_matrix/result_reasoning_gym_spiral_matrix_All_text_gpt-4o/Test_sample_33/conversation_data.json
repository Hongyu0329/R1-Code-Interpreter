    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to carefully follow the spiral traversal rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is 8 rows by 8 columns.\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - Start with four boundaries: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.\n   - Initially, `top = 0`, `bottom = 7`, `left = 0`, and `right = 7`.\n\n3. **Traverse the Matrix in Spiral Order**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row. After traversing, increment `top` by 1.\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column. After traversing, decrement `right` by 1.\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row, if `top` <= `bottom`. After traversing, decrement `bottom` by 1.\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column, if `left` <= `right`. After traversing, increment `left` by 1.\n   - Repeat the above steps until `top` > `bottom` or `left` > `right`.\n\n4. **Collect Elements**:\n   - As you traverse, collect the elements in the order they are visited.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Format the collected elements as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- **Initial Matrix**:\n  ```\n  0 3 7 8 4 7 5 2\n  8 3 2 1 8 2 8 3\n  6 8 8 4 5 9 2 4\n  5 3 7 3 4 6 4 3\n  9 1 5 2 5 0 6 3\n  1 0 5 2 7 6 8 6\n  9 9 7 7 5 0 4 0\n  4 6 4 2 7 8 1 2\n  ```\n\n- **Spiral Order Traversal**:\n  - Move Right: `0 3 7 8 4 7 5 2`\n  - Move Down: `3 4 3 3 6 0 2`\n  - Move Left: `1 8 7 2 4 6 4 2`\n  - Move Up: `9 1 5 2 5 0 6 3`\n  - Move Right: `8 8 4 5 9 2`\n  - Move Down: `4 6 8 6`\n  - Move Left: `7 3 4 6`\n  - Move Up: `8 3 2 1`\n  - Move Right: `8 4 5`\n  - Move Down: `2 5`\n  - Move Left: `5 2`\n  - Move Up: `7 3`\n  - Move Right: `7`\n  - Move Down: `5`\n  - Move Left: `7`\n\n- **Final Spiral Order**:\n  - The elements in spiral order are: `0 3 7 8 4 7 5 2 3 4 3 3 6 0 2 1 8 7 2 4 6 4 2 9 1 5 2 5 0 6 3 8 8 4 5 9 2 4 6 8 6 7 3 4 6 8 3 2 1 8 4 5 2 5 5 2 7 3 7 5 7`\n\n- **Formatted Output**:\n  - <<<0 3 7 8 4 7 5 2 3 4 3 3 6 0 2 1 8 7 2 4 6 4 2 9 1 5 2 5 0 6 3 8 8 4 5 9 2 4 6 8 6 7 3 4 6 8 3 2 1 8 4 5 2 5 5 2 7 3 7 5 7>>>\n\n**Answer**: <<<0 3 7 8 4 7 5 2 3 4 3 3 6 0 2 1 8 7 2 4 6 4 2 9 1 5 2 5 0 6 3 8 8 4 5 9 2 4 6 8 6 7 3 4 6 8 3 2 1 8 4 5 2 5 5 2 7 3 7 5 7>>>"
