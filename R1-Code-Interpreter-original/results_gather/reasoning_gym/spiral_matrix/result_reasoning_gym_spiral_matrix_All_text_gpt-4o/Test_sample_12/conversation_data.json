    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to carefully follow the spiral traversal pattern. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initialization**: \n   - Start at the top-left corner of the matrix.\n   - Define boundaries for the traversal: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.\n   - Initially, `top` is 0, `bottom` is the last row index, `left` is 0, and `right` is the last column index.\n\n2. **Traverse the matrix in a spiral order**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row. After traversing, increment the `top` boundary.\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column. After traversing, decrement the `right` boundary.\n   - **Move Left**: If `top` is still less than or equal to `bottom`, traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row. After traversing, decrement the `bottom` boundary.\n   - **Move Up**: If `left` is still less than or equal to `right`, traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column. After traversing, increment the `left` boundary.\n   - Repeat the above steps until the `top` boundary exceeds the `bottom` boundary or the `left` boundary exceeds the `right` boundary.\n\n3. **Output the result**:\n   - Collect all the elements in the order they are visited and format them as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\nMatrix:\n```\n1 9 9 5 2 9 7 3\n1 1 5 0 7 0 4 9\n3 5 4 7 8 4 3 4\n6 5 3 3 2 7 1 9\n6 7 7 0 1 4 1 8\n8 2 5 9 0 1 4 0\n2 1 5 5 6 4 0 3\n1 6 6 0 2 8 8 5\n```\n\n- **Move Right**: 1, 9, 9, 5, 2, 9, 7, 3\n- **Move Down**: 9, 4, 9, 8, 0, 3, 5\n- **Move Left**: 8, 8, 2, 0, 6, 6, 1\n- **Move Up**: 2, 8, 5, 2, 6\n- **Move Right**: 1, 5, 0, 7, 0, 4\n- **Move Down**: 3, 1, 4, 0\n- **Move Left**: 4, 1, 7, 7\n- **Move Up**: 5, 3\n- **Move Right**: 4, 7, 8\n- **Move Down**: 2, 1\n- **Move Left**: 0, 3\n- **Move Up**: 5\n- **Move Right**: 3\n\nCombining all these elements, the spiral order of the matrix is:\n\n<<<1 9 9 5 2 9 7 3 9 4 9 8 0 3 5 8 8 2 0 6 6 1 2 8 5 2 6 1 5 0 7 0 4 3 1 4 0 4 1 7 7 5 3 4 7 8 2 1 0 3 5 3>>>"
