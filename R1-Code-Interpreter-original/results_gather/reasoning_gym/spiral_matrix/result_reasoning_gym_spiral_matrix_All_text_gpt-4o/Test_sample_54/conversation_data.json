    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     8 5\n     1 0\n     ```\n   - This is a 2x2 matrix with 2 rows and 2 columns.\n\n2. **Identify the Spiral Order Process**:\n   - Start from the top-left corner of the matrix.\n   - Move right across the top row.\n   - Move down the last column.\n   - Move left across the bottom row.\n   - Move up the first column.\n   - Continue this process for any inner layers of the matrix.\n\n3. **Apply the Spiral Order to the Given Matrix**:\n   - Start at the top-left corner: `8`.\n   - Move right across the top row: `8, 5`.\n   - Move down the last column: `8, 5, 0`.\n   - Move left across the bottom row: `8, 5, 0, 1`.\n   - Since the matrix is only 2x2, there are no more inner layers to process.\n\n4. **Compile the Result**:\n   - The elements in spiral order are: `8, 5, 0, 1`.\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final output should be a space-separated list of integers enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nTherefore, the list of elements in spiral order for the given matrix is:\n\n<<<8 5 0 1>>>"
