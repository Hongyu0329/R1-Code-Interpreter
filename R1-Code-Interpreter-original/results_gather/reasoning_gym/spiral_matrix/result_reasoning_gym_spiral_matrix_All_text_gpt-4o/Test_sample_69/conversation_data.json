    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 5x5 matrix:\n     ```\n     5 3 3 5 8\n     3 5 4 2 8\n     3 7 1 8 3\n     0 3 7 4 7\n     7 9 1 7 5\n     ```\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - Start with four boundaries: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.\n   - Initially, `top = 0`, `bottom = 4`, `left = 0`, `right = 4`.\n\n3. **Traverse the Matrix in Spiral Order**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row. Increment `top` after traversing.\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column. Decrement `right` after traversing.\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row. Decrement `bottom` after traversing.\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column. Increment `left` after traversing.\n   - Repeat the above steps until `top` exceeds `bottom` or `left` exceeds `right`.\n\n4. **Collect Elements**:\n   - As we traverse, collect the elements in the order they are visited.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Format the collected elements as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- **Move Right** along the top row (row 0): `5 3 3 5 8`\n- **Move Down** along the right column (column 4): `8 3 7 5`\n- **Move Left** along the bottom row (row 4): `7 9 1 7`\n- **Move Up** along the left column (column 0): `0 3`\n- **Move Right** along the second row (row 1): `5 4 2`\n- **Move Down** along the second last column (column 3): `8 4`\n- **Move Left** along the second last row (row 3): `7 3`\n- **Move Up** along the second column (column 1): `7`\n- **Move Right** along the third row (row 2): `1 8`\n- **Move Down** along the third column (column 2): `7`\n\nThe collected elements in spiral order are: `5 3 3 5 8 8 3 7 5 7 9 1 7 0 3 5 4 2 8 4 7 3 7 1 8`\n\nThe final output is:\n<<<5 3 3 5 8 8 3 7 5 7 9 1 7 0 3 5 4 2 8 4 7 3 7 1 8>>>"
