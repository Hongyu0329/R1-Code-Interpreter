    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 9x9 matrix.\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - We need to keep track of the boundaries of the matrix as we traverse it in a spiral order.\n   - Initialize `top` to 0, `bottom` to 8 (last row index), `left` to 0, and `right` to 8 (last column index).\n\n3. **Traverse the Matrix in Spiral Order**:\n   - We will use a loop to traverse the matrix until all elements are visited.\n   - In each iteration, we will adjust the boundaries after completing a full cycle of right, down, left, and up movements.\n\n4. **Detailed Steps**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row. After traversing, increment `top` by 1 to move to the next row.\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column. After traversing, decrement `right` by 1 to move to the previous column.\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row, if `top` <= `bottom`. After traversing, decrement `bottom` by 1 to move to the previous row.\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column, if `left` <= `right`. After traversing, increment `left` by 1 to move to the next column.\n\n5. **Repeat the Process**:\n   - Continue the process until `top` exceeds `bottom` or `left` exceeds `right`.\n\n6. **Collect the Elements**:\n   - As we traverse, collect the elements in the order they are visited.\n\n7. **Format the Output**:\n   - Once all elements are collected, format them as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start at the top-left corner and move right: 9, 5, 8, 7, 3, 0, 2, 4, 8\n- Move down the right column: 7, 2, 6, 9, 3, 1, 9, 3, 6\n- Move left along the bottom row: 0, 1, 7, 7, 5, 6, 4, 2\n- Move up the left column: 5, 8, 2, 5, 2, 7, 4\n- Move right along the second row from the top: 0, 3, 9, 9, 2, 4, 3\n- Move down the second column from the right: 0, 5, 3, 4, 7, 9\n- Move left along the second row from the bottom: 1, 3, 9, 9, 1, 8\n- Move up the second column from the left: 6, 2, 9, 4\n- Move right along the third row from the top: 4, 3, 2, 7, 9\n- Move down the third column from the right: 0, 1, 4\n- Move left along the third row from the bottom: 8, 9, 9, 1\n- Move up the third column from the left: 2, 4\n- Move right along the fourth row from the top: 2, 7\n- Move down the fourth column from the right: 5\n- Move left along the fourth row from the bottom: 8, 9\n- Move up the fourth column from the left: 2\n- Finally, move right along the center row: 3\n\nThe final spiral order of elements is:\n<<<9 5 8 7 3 0 2 4 8 7 2 6 9 3 1 9 3 6 0 1 7 7 5 6 4 2 5 8 2 5 2 7 4 0 3 9 9 2 4 3 0 5 3 4 7 9 1 3 9 9 1 8 6 2 9 4 4 3 2 7 9 0 1 4 8 9 9 1 2 4 2 7 5 8 9 2 3>>>"
