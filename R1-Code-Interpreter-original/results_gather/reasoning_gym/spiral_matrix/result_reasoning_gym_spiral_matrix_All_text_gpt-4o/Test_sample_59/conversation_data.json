    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Layout**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     7 7 9\n     2 7 2\n     7 4 6\n     ```\n   - It is a 3x3 matrix.\n\n2. **Spiral Order Traversal**:\n   - Start from the top-left corner and move right across the first row.\n   - Move down the last column.\n   - Move left across the bottom row.\n   - Move up the first column.\n   - Continue this pattern for the inner layers of the matrix.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Traversal**:\n   - **First Row (Left to Right)**: Start at the top-left corner and move right across the first row.\n     - Elements: 7, 7, 9\n   - **Last Column (Top to Bottom)**: Move down the last column.\n     - Elements: 2, 6\n   - **Bottom Row (Right to Left)**: Move left across the bottom row.\n     - Elements: 4, 7\n   - **First Column (Bottom to Top)**: Move up the first column.\n     - Element: 2\n   - **Inner Layer**: Now, we are left with the inner 1x1 matrix.\n     - Element: 7\n\n4. **Combine the Elements**:\n   - Combine all the elements in the order they were visited: 7, 7, 9, 2, 6, 4, 7, 2, 7\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final output should be a space-separated list of integers enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<7 7 9 2 6 4 7 2 7>>>"
