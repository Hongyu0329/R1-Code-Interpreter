    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 5x5 matrix:\n     ```\n     3 0 5 7 8\n     3 4 5 5 0\n     7 7 2 8 0\n     5 2 7 5 2\n     2 8 0 2 3\n     ```\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - Start with four boundaries: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.\n   - Initially, `top = 0`, `bottom = 4`, `left = 0`, `right = 4`.\n\n3. **Traverse the Matrix in Spiral Order**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row. After traversing, increment `top`.\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column. After traversing, decrement `right`.\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row, if `top` <= `bottom`. After traversing, decrement `bottom`.\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column, if `left` <= `right`. After traversing, increment `left`.\n   - Repeat the above steps until all elements are visited.\n\n4. **Collect the Elements**:\n   - As we traverse, collect the elements in the order they are visited.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Format the collected elements as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- **Move Right** along the top row: `3 0 5 7 8`\n- **Move Down** along the right column: `0 0 2 3`\n- **Move Left** along the bottom row: `2 5 7 2`\n- **Move Up** along the left column: `5 7 3`\n- **Move Right** along the second row from the top: `4 5 5`\n- **Move Down** along the second column from the right: `8 7`\n- **Move Left** along the second row from the bottom: `2 8`\n- **Move Up** along the second column from the left: `7`\n- **Move Right** along the third row from the top: `2`\n\nThe collected elements in spiral order are: `3 0 5 7 8 0 0 2 3 2 5 7 2 5 7 3 4 5 5 8 7 2 8 7 2`.\n\nTherefore, the final output is:\n\n<<<3 0 5 7 8 0 0 2 3 2 5 7 2 5 7 3 4 5 5 8 7 2 8 7 2>>>"
