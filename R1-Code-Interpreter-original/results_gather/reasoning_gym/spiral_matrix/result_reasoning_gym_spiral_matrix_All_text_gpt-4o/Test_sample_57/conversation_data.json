    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Layout**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     5 6 2\n     5 4 3\n     9 2 1\n     ```\n   - This is a 3x3 matrix.\n\n2. **Spiral Order Traversal**:\n   - Start from the top-left corner and move right across the first row.\n   - Move down the last column.\n   - Move left across the bottom row.\n   - Move up the first column.\n   - Continue this pattern for the inner layers of the matrix.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Traversal**:\n   - **First Row (Left to Right)**: Start at the top-left corner and move right across the first row.\n     - Elements: 5, 6, 2\n   - **Last Column (Top to Bottom)**: Move down the last column.\n     - Elements: 3, 1\n   - **Bottom Row (Right to Left)**: Move left across the bottom row.\n     - Elements: 2, 9\n   - **First Column (Bottom to Top)**: Move up the first column.\n     - Element: 5\n   - **Inner Layer**: Now, we have a smaller matrix to consider:\n     ```\n     4\n     ```\n     - Since it's a single element, just add it to the list.\n     - Element: 4\n\n4. **Combine the Elements**:\n   - Combine all the elements collected in the order of traversal: 5, 6, 2, 3, 1, 2, 9, 5, 4.\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final output should be a space-separated list of integers enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that every element of the matrix is visited in the correct spiral order.\n\n**Final Answer**: <<<5 6 2 3 1 2 9 5 4>>>"
