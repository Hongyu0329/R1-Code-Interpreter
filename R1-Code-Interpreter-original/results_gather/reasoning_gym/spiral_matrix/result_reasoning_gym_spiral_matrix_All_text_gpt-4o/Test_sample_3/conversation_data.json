    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to carefully follow the steps of the spiral traversal. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Initialization**: \n   - Start at the top-left corner of the matrix.\n   - Define boundaries for the traversal: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.\n   - Initially, `top` is 0, `bottom` is the last row index, `left` is 0, and `right` is the last column index.\n\n2. **Spiral Traversal**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row. After traversing, increment the `top` boundary.\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column. After traversing, decrement the `right` boundary.\n   - **Move Left**: If `top` is still less than or equal to `bottom`, traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row. After traversing, decrement the `bottom` boundary.\n   - **Move Up**: If `left` is still less than or equal to `right`, traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column. After traversing, increment the `left` boundary.\n   - Repeat the above steps until all elements are visited.\n\n3. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure that after each move, the boundaries are checked to prevent re-traversing already visited elements.\n   - Handle cases where the matrix might be a single row or column.\n\n4. **Output**:\n   - Collect the elements in the order they are visited and format them as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n```\n4 2 4 8 0 1 4 7 9 5\n5 1 8 5 6 0 0 0 3 6\n3 9 5 1 8 0 7 7 6 8\n5 8 6 3 1 6 4 5 8 2\n0 2 8 0 1 7 8 6 3 1\n5 9 9 0 1 1 8 4 7 0\n9 2 5 2 7 8 7 9 8 0\n0 9 2 0 2 5 4 9 2 1\n7 2 5 5 6 8 7 9 1 4\n9 7 9 2 6 4 1 1 7 0\n```\n\n- Start at (0,0) and move right: `4 2 4 8 0 1 4 7 9 5`\n- Move down the right column: `6 8 2 1 0 0 1 4 0`\n- Move left along the bottom row: `7 1 1 4 6 2 9 7 9`\n- Move up the left column: `9 7 0 9 5 2 9 5`\n- Continue the spiral inward following the same pattern.\n\nFollowing these steps, the complete spiral order for the matrix is:\n\n<<<4 2 4 8 0 1 4 7 9 5 6 8 2 1 0 0 1 4 0 7 1 1 4 6 2 9 7 9 9 7 0 9 5 2 9 5 3 5 8 6 3 1 8 0 2 8 6 8 7 8 0 9 2 0 2 5 4 9 2 1 8 7 8 6 4 5 7 0 1 6 1 0 9 5 1 8 0 7 7 6 3 0 0 0 6 5 8 1 5 9 3 8 5 1 6 0 0 0 3 6>>>"
