    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Layout**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     9 7 6\n     7 6 1\n     9 6 4\n     ```\n   - It is a 3x3 matrix.\n\n2. **Spiral Order Traversal**:\n   - Start from the top-left corner and move right across the first row.\n   - Move down the last column.\n   - Move left across the bottom row.\n   - Move up the first column.\n   - Continue this pattern for the inner layers of the matrix.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Traversal**:\n   - **First Row (Left to Right)**: 9, 7, 6\n   - **Last Column (Top to Bottom)**: 1, 4\n   - **Bottom Row (Right to Left)**: 6, 9 (Note: We already visited the last element of this row, so we only take the unvisited ones)\n   - **First Column (Bottom to Top)**: 7 (Note: We already visited the first element of this column, so we only take the unvisited ones)\n   - **Inner Layer**: Now, we are left with a single element in the center of the matrix, which is 6.\n\n4. **Compile the Spiral Order**:\n   - Combine all the elements in the order they were visited: 9, 7, 6, 1, 4, 6, 9, 7, 6.\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final output should be a space-separated list of these integers enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that every element of the matrix is visited in the correct spiral order.\n\n**Final Answer**: <<<9 7 6 1 4 6 9 7 6>>>"
