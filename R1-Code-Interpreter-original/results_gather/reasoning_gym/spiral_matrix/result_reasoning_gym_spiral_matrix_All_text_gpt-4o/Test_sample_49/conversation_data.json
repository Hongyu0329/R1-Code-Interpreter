    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to carefully follow the steps of traversing the matrix in a spiral pattern. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Initialization**: \n   - Start at the top-left corner of the matrix.\n   - Define boundaries for the traversal: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.\n   - Initially, `top` is 0, `bottom` is the last row index, `left` is 0, and `right` is the last column index.\n\n2. **Traverse the matrix in a spiral order**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from the `left` to the `right` boundary along the `top` row. After traversing, increment the `top` boundary to move downwards.\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from the `top` to the `bottom` boundary along the `right` column. After traversing, decrement the `right` boundary to move leftwards.\n   - **Move Left**: If `top` is still less than or equal to `bottom`, traverse from the `right` to the `left` boundary along the `bottom` row. After traversing, decrement the `bottom` boundary to move upwards.\n   - **Move Up**: If `left` is still less than or equal to `right`, traverse from the `bottom` to the `top` boundary along the `left` column. After traversing, increment the `left` boundary to move rightwards.\n   - Repeat the above steps until all elements are visited.\n\n3. **Output the result**:\n   - Collect the elements in the order they are visited and format them as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n```\n2 4 4 3 7 4 6 2 9 6\n2 0 3 0 6 3 4 7 6 8\n0 9 8 7 5 5 1 5 8 5\n4 6 0 0 0 8 6 3 5 2\n8 9 5 3 2 3 6 5 0 4\n2 9 6 5 6 1 9 5 8 1\n1 2 8 0 4 6 0 1 6 3\n0 4 4 4 3 7 7 8 4 3\n2 1 5 2 3 3 7 8 9 6\n7 9 5 9 7 0 3 2 7 1\n```\n\n- **Move Right**: 2, 4, 4, 3, 7, 4, 6, 2, 9, 6\n- **Move Down**: 8, 5, 2, 4, 1, 3, 6, 1\n- **Move Left**: 7, 2, 5, 9, 5, 9, 7, 0, 3, 2, 7\n- **Move Up**: 9, 1, 2, 0, 4, 8, 2\n- **Move Right**: 0, 3, 0, 6, 3, 4, 7, 6\n- **Move Down**: 5, 5, 8, 4, 3\n- **Move Left**: 7, 3, 2, 3, 5, 6, 5, 8\n- **Move Up**: 5, 1, 5, 1, 9, 2\n- **Move Right**: 9, 8, 7, 5, 5, 1\n- **Move Down**: 6, 0, 4, 6\n- **Move Left**: 0, 8, 9, 6\n- **Move Up**: 6, 3, 6, 0\n- **Move Right**: 0, 0, 8, 6\n- **Move Down**: 9, 5, 3\n- **Move Left**: 5, 6, 1\n- **Move Up**: 6, 0, 4\n- **Move Right**: 4, 3, 2\n- **Move Down**: 5, 6\n- **Move Left**: 5, 9\n- **Move Up**: 6, 5\n- **Move Right**: 3\n\nThe final spiral order of the matrix is:\n\n<<<2 4 4 3 7 4 6 2 9 6 8 5 2 4 1 3 6 1 7 2 5 9 5 9 7 0 3 2 7 9 1 2 0 4 8 2 0 3 0 6 3 4 7 6 5 5 8 4 3 7 3 2 3 5 6 5 8 5 1 5 1 9 2 9 8 7 5 5 1 6 0 4 6 0 8 9 6 6 3 6 0 0 0 8 6 9 5 3 5 6 1 6 0 4 4 3 2 5 6 5 9 6 5 3>>>"
