    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 6x6 matrix:\n     ```\n     5 1 5 1 5 1\n     9 2 7 1 2 4\n     0 2 5 4 2 0\n     4 0 1 6 1 4\n     0 0 4 9 1 6\n     4 1 6 3 6 7\n     ```\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - Start with four boundaries: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.\n   - Initially, `top = 0`, `bottom = 5`, `left = 0`, `right = 5`.\n\n3. **Traverse the Matrix in Spiral Order**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row, then increment `top`.\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column, then decrement `right`.\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row, then decrement `bottom`.\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column, then increment `left`.\n   - Repeat the above steps until `top` exceeds `bottom` or `left` exceeds `right`.\n\n4. **Collect Elements**:\n   - As you traverse, collect the elements in the order they are visited.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Format the collected elements as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- **First Layer**:\n  - Move Right: `5 1 5 1 5 1`\n  - Move Down: `4 0 6 7`\n  - Move Left: `6 1 9 4`\n  - Move Up: `0 4 0 9`\n\n- **Second Layer**:\n  - Move Right: `2 7 1 2`\n  - Move Down: `2 1`\n  - Move Left: `1 6`\n  - Move Up: `1 2`\n\n- **Third Layer**:\n  - Move Right: `5 4`\n  - Move Down: `1`\n  - Move Left: `4`\n\n- **Center Element**:\n  - `6`\n\nCombining all these elements, we get the spiral order of the matrix.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<5 1 5 1 5 1 4 0 6 7 6 1 9 4 0 4 0 9 2 7 1 2 2 1 1 6 1 2 5 4 1 4 6>>>"
