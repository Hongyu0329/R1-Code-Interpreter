    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to carefully follow the steps outlined for traversing the matrix in a spiral manner. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 4x4 matrix:\n     ```\n     0 9 9 8\n     9 4 5 2\n     1 0 5 5\n     7 4 8 4\n     ```\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - Start with four boundaries: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.\n   - Initially, `top = 0`, `bottom = 3`, `left = 0`, `right = 3`.\n\n3. **Traverse the Matrix in Spiral Order**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` boundary.\n     - Elements: 0, 9, 9, 8\n     - Update `top` boundary: `top = 1`\n   \n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` boundary.\n     - Elements: 2, 5, 4\n     - Update `right` boundary: `right = 2`\n   \n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` boundary.\n     - Elements: 8, 4, 7\n     - Update `bottom` boundary: `bottom = 2`\n   \n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` boundary.\n     - Elements: 1, 9\n     - Update `left` boundary: `left = 1`\n\n4. **Repeat for Inner Matrix**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` boundary.\n     - Elements: 4, 5\n     - Update `top` boundary: `top = 2`\n   \n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` boundary.\n     - Elements: 5\n     - Update `right` boundary: `right = 1`\n   \n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` boundary.\n     - Elements: 0\n     - Update `bottom` boundary: `bottom = 1`\n\n5. **End Condition**:\n   - The traversal ends when `top` exceeds `bottom` or `left` exceeds `right`.\n\n6. **Compile the Result**:\n   - Combine all the elements collected in the order they were traversed.\n\nThe final spiral order of the matrix is:\n<<<0 9 9 8 2 5 4 8 4 7 1 9 4 5 5 0>>>"
