    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to carefully follow the steps outlined for traversing the matrix in a spiral manner. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 4x4 matrix:\n     ```\n     7 7 8 4\n     4 1 4 2\n     8 9 6 7\n     3 8 5 8\n     ```\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - We need to keep track of the boundaries of the matrix as we traverse it in a spiral order.\n   - Start with `top = 0`, `bottom = 3` (last row index), `left = 0`, and `right = 3` (last column index).\n\n3. **Traverse the Matrix in Spiral Order**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row.\n     - Elements: 7, 7, 8, 4\n     - Update `top` to 1 (move the top boundary down).\n\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column.\n     - Elements: 2, 7, 8\n     - Update `right` to 2 (move the right boundary left).\n\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row.\n     - Elements: 5, 8, 3\n     - Update `bottom` to 2 (move the bottom boundary up).\n\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column.\n     - Elements: 8, 4\n     - Update `left` to 1 (move the left boundary right).\n\n   - **Repeat the Process for Inner Matrix**:\n     - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row.\n       - Elements: 1, 4\n       - Update `top` to 2.\n\n     - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column.\n       - Elements: 6\n       - Update `right` to 1.\n\n     - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row.\n       - Elements: 9\n       - Update `bottom` to 1.\n\n4. **Combine the Elements**:\n   - The elements collected in spiral order are: 7, 7, 8, 4, 2, 7, 8, 3, 8, 5, 8, 4, 1, 4, 6, 9.\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final output should be a space-separated list of these elements enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<7 7 8 4 2 7 8 3 8 5 8 4 1 4 6 9>>>"
