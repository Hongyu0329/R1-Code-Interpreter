    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to carefully follow the spiral traversal rules. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 6x6 matrix.\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - Start with four boundaries: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.\n   - Initially, `top = 0`, `bottom = 5` (last row index), `left = 0`, and `right = 5` (last column index).\n\n3. **Spiral Traversal**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row. After traversing, increment `top` by 1.\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column. After traversing, decrement `right` by 1.\n   - **Move Left**: If `top` <= `bottom`, traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row. After traversing, decrement `bottom` by 1.\n   - **Move Up**: If `left` <= `right`, traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column. After traversing, increment `left` by 1.\n   - Repeat the above steps until `top` > `bottom` or `left` > `right`.\n\n4. **Collect Elements**:\n   - As you traverse, collect the elements in the order you visit them.\n\n5. **Output Format**:\n   - The collected elements should be output as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- **Initial Matrix**:\n  ```\n  2 7 8 9 3 3\n  0 4 7 2 6 0\n  8 8 0 6 3 4\n  6 7 6 7 7 6\n  8 3 1 5 1 6\n  0 4 2 1 3 8\n  ```\n\n- **Spiral Order Traversal**:\n  1. Move Right: `2 7 8 9 3 3`\n  2. Move Down: `0 4 6 6 6`\n  3. Move Left: `8 3 1 5 1 6`\n  4. Move Up: `8 6 8 0`\n  5. Move Right: `4 7 2 6`\n  6. Move Down: `7 7`\n  7. Move Left: `7 6 3`\n  8. Move Up: `7 8`\n  9. Move Right: `0 6`\n  10. Move Down: `1`\n  11. Move Left: `2 4`\n  12. Move Up: `3`\n\n- **Final Spiral Order**:\n  - The elements in spiral order are: `2 7 8 9 3 3 0 4 6 6 6 8 3 1 5 1 6 8 6 8 0 4 7 2 6 7 7 7 6 3 7 8 0 6 1 2 4 3`\n\n- **Formatted Output**:\n  - The final output should be: <<<2 7 8 9 3 3 0 4 6 6 6 8 3 1 5 1 6 8 6 8 0 4 7 2 6 7 7 7 6 3 7 8 0 6 1 2 4 3>>>\n\nAnswer: <<<2 7 8 9 3 3 0 4 6 6 6 8 3 1 5 1 6 8 6 8 0 4 7 2 6 7 7 7 6 3 7 8 0 6 1 2 4 3>>>"
