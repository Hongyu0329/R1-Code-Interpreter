    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 10x10 matrix.\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - We need to keep track of the boundaries of the matrix as we traverse it in a spiral order.\n   - Initialize `top` to 0, `bottom` to 9 (last row index), `left` to 0, and `right` to 9 (last column index).\n\n3. **Traverse the Matrix in Spiral Order**:\n   - **Move Right**: Start from the top-left corner and move right across the topmost row from `left` to `right`. After traversing, increment `top` by 1 to move the boundary down.\n   - **Move Down**: Move down the rightmost column from `top` to `bottom`. After traversing, decrement `right` by 1 to move the boundary left.\n   - **Move Left**: If `top` is still less than or equal to `bottom`, move left across the bottommost row from `right` to `left`. After traversing, decrement `bottom` by 1 to move the boundary up.\n   - **Move Up**: If `left` is still less than or equal to `right`, move up the leftmost column from `bottom` to `top`. After traversing, increment `left` by 1 to move the boundary right.\n   - Repeat the above steps until all elements are visited.\n\n4. **Collect the Elements**:\n   - As we traverse the matrix in the above order, collect the elements in a list.\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - Convert the list of elements into a space-separated string and enclose it within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start at the top-left corner and move right: `0 8 5 6 7 0 9 4 3 7`\n- Move down the rightmost column: `7 9 9 3 9 0 9 5 9 3`\n- Move left across the bottom row: `9 2 1 0 8 4 9 3 9`\n- Move up the leftmost column: `2 8 0 0 8 5 1 7`\n- Continue the spiral inward, repeating the above steps until all elements are visited.\n\nFollowing these steps, the spiral order of the matrix is:\n\n<<<0 8 5 6 7 0 9 4 3 7 7 9 9 3 9 0 9 5 9 3 9 2 1 0 8 4 9 3 9 2 8 0 0 8 5 1 7 2 0 1 5 0 6 8 5 2 6 9 9 2 8 8 8 2 5 7 6 2 2 2 0 8 8 2 0 8 0 3 6 7 9 3 2 5 3 7 9 3 3 9 7 9 7 8 0 8 0 2 3 4 8 6 8 0 8 0 2 3 4 9>>>"
