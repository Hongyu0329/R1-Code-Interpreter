    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to carefully follow the steps of moving in a spiral pattern. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is 7 rows by 7 columns.\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - Start with four boundaries: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.\n   - Initially, `top = 0`, `bottom = 6`, `left = 0`, `right = 6`.\n\n3. **Traverse the Matrix in Spiral Order**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row. After traversing, increment `top` by 1.\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column. After traversing, decrement `right` by 1.\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row. After traversing, decrement `bottom` by 1.\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column. After traversing, increment `left` by 1.\n   - Repeat the above steps until `top` exceeds `bottom` or `left` exceeds `right`.\n\n4. **Collect Elements**:\n   - As we traverse, collect the elements in the order they are visited.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Format the collected elements as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- **Initial Matrix**:\n  ```\n  7 3 3 5 8 7 6\n  0 6 2 6 7 2 1\n  3 2 1 1 4 4 6\n  3 9 5 8 4 6 0\n  7 6 9 2 7 0 8\n  5 0 8 5 0 8 8\n  6 4 3 4 9 2 9\n  ```\n\n- **Spiral Order Traversal**:\n  1. Move Right: `7 3 3 5 8 7 6`\n  2. Move Down: `1 6 0 8 8 9`\n  3. Move Left: `2 9 4 3 4 6`\n  4. Move Up: `5 0 7 3`\n  5. Move Right: `0 6 2 6 7`\n  6. Move Down: `4 4 6`\n  7. Move Left: `8 5 9`\n  8. Move Up: `6 2`\n  9. Move Right: `1 1 4`\n  10. Move Down: `8`\n  11. Move Left: `5`\n  12. Move Up: `9`\n\n- **Final Spiral Order**:\n  - The elements collected in spiral order are: `7 3 3 5 8 7 6 1 6 0 8 8 9 2 9 4 3 4 6 5 0 7 3 0 6 2 6 7 4 4 6 8 5 9 6 2 1 1 4 8 5 9`\n\n- **Formatted Output**:\n  - The final output is: <<<7 3 3 5 8 7 6 1 6 0 8 8 9 2 9 4 3 4 6 5 0 7 3 0 6 2 6 7 4 4 6 8 5 9 6 2 1 1 4 8 5 9>>>\n\nTherefore, the list of elements in spiral order is:\n<<<7 3 3 5 8 7 6 1 6 0 8 8 9 2 9 4 3 4 6 5 0 7 3 0 6 2 6 7 4 4 6 8 5 9 6 2 1 1 4 8 5 9>>>"
