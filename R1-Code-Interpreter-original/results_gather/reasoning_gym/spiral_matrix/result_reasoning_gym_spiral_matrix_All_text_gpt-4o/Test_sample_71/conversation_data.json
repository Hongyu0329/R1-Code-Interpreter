    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to carefully follow the spiral traversal rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 9x9 matrix.\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - Start with four boundaries: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.\n   - Initially, `top = 0`, `bottom = 8`, `left = 0`, and `right = 8`.\n\n3. **Spiral Traversal**:\n   - We will traverse the matrix in a spiral order by adjusting the boundaries after each complete traversal of a side.\n   - Continue the process until `top` exceeds `bottom` or `left` exceeds `right`.\n\n4. **Traversal Steps**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row. Increment `top` by 1.\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column. Decrement `right` by 1.\n   - **Move Left**: If `top` <= `bottom`, traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row. Decrement `bottom` by 1.\n   - **Move Up**: If `left` <= `right`, traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column. Increment `left` by 1.\n\n5. **Repeat**:\n   - Repeat the above steps until the boundaries overlap, ensuring all elements are visited.\n\n6. **Output Format**:\n   - Collect the elements in the order they are visited and format them as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- **Initial Matrix**:\n  ```\n  5 0 6 3 8 4 3 6 1\n  0 0 1 7 1 7 9 9 7\n  1 4 4 0 1 6 7 1 7\n  1 1 9 8 0 9 9 5 6\n  1 4 2 7 6 3 7 8 3\n  8 9 4 3 9 1 4 8 3\n  4 2 5 9 0 7 6 3 2\n  7 6 9 3 8 4 9 1 2\n  2 8 2 1 3 4 7 5 9\n  ```\n\n- **Spiral Order Traversal**:\n  - Move Right: `5 0 6 3 8 4 3 6 1`\n  - Move Down: `7 7 7 6 3 2 9 2`\n  - Move Left: `2 1 8 7 6 9 6 7`\n  - Move Up: `4 8 1 1 0 0`\n  - Move Right: `1 4 4 0 1 6 7 9`\n  - Move Down: `9 8 3 8 3`\n  - Move Left: `8 4 9 3`\n  - Move Up: `4 9 1`\n  - Move Right: `9 8 0`\n  - Move Down: `9 7`\n  - Move Left: `6 7`\n  - Move Up: `9`\n  - Move Right: `2 7`\n  - Move Down: `3`\n  - Move Left: `5`\n  - Move Up: `4`\n\n- **Final Spiral Order**:\n  - The elements in spiral order are: `5 0 6 3 8 4 3 6 1 7 7 7 6 3 2 9 2 1 8 7 6 9 6 7 4 8 1 1 0 0 1 4 4 0 1 6 7 9 9 8 3 8 3 8 4 9 3 4 9 1 9 8 0 9 7 6 7 9 2 7 3 5 4`\n\n- **Formatted Output**:\n  - <<<5 0 6 3 8 4 3 6 1 7 7 7 6 3 2 9 2 1 8 7 6 9 6 7 4 8 1 1 0 0 1 4 4 0 1 6 7 9 9 8 3 8 3 8 4 9 3 4 9 1 9 8 0 9 7 6 7 9 2 7 3 5 4>>>\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<5 0 6 3 8 4 3 6 1 7 7 7 6 3 2 9 2 1 8 7 6 9 6 7 4 8 1 1 0 0 1 4 4 0 1 6 7 9 9 8 3 8 3 8 4 9 3 4 9 1 9 8 0 9 7 6 7 9 2 7 3 5 4>>>"
