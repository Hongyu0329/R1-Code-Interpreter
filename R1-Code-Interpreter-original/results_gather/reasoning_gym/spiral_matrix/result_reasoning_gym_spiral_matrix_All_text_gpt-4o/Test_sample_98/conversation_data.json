    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: The given matrix is a 10x10 matrix. This means there are 10 rows and 10 columns.\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**: \n   - `top` boundary starts at the first row (index 0).\n   - `bottom` boundary starts at the last row (index 9).\n   - `left` boundary starts at the first column (index 0).\n   - `right` boundary starts at the last column (index 9).\n\n3. **Spiral Traversal**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from the `left` to the `right` boundary along the `top` row. After traversing, increment the `top` boundary by 1 to move to the next row.\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from the `top` to the `bottom` boundary along the `right` column. After traversing, decrement the `right` boundary by 1 to move to the previous column.\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from the `right` to the `left` boundary along the `bottom` row, if the `top` boundary is still less than or equal to the `bottom` boundary. After traversing, decrement the `bottom` boundary by 1 to move to the previous row.\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from the `bottom` to the `top` boundary along the `left` column, if the `left` boundary is still less than or equal to the `right` boundary. After traversing, increment the `left` boundary by 1 to move to the next column.\n\n4. **Repeat**: Continue the above steps until the `top` boundary exceeds the `bottom` boundary or the `left` boundary exceeds the `right` boundary.\n\n5. **Collect Elements**: As you traverse, collect the elements in the order they are visited.\n\n6. **Output Format**: Once all elements are collected, format them as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start at the top-left corner and move right: `2 8 1 6 1 2 9 7 2 4`\n- Move down the right column: `9 0 6 8 9 4 8 5 6`\n- Move left along the bottom row: `7 9 1 5 6 6 1 2 4`\n- Move up the left column: `2 8 7 6 4 0 5 8`\n- Move right along the second row: `3 0 1 7 2 5 0 3`\n- Move down the second last column: `6 5 9 7 6 4`\n- Move left along the second last row: `5 0 5 9 8 4 6`\n- Move up the second column: `2 8 7 0 8`\n- Move right along the third row: `5 8 4 8 6`\n- Move down the third last column: `9 5 2`\n- Move left along the third last row: `3 9 5 1`\n- Move up the third column: `2 0 8`\n- Move right along the fourth row: `0 8 7`\n- Move down the fourth last column: `9 5`\n- Move left along the fourth last row: `6 7`\n- Move up the fourth column: `5 8`\n- Move right along the fifth row: `1 1`\n- Move down the fifth last column: `8`\n- Move left along the fifth last row: `3`\n- Move up the fifth column: `8`\n\nFollowing these steps, the spiral order of the matrix is:\n\n<<<2 8 1 6 1 2 9 7 2 4 9 0 6 8 9 4 8 5 6 7 9 1 5 6 6 1 2 4 2 8 7 6 4 0 5 8 3 0 1 7 2 5 0 3 6 5 9 7 6 4 5 0 5 9 8 4 6 2 8 7 0 8 5 8 4 8 6 9 5 2 3 9 5 1 2 0 8 0 8 7 9 5 6 7 5 8 1 1 8 3 8>>>\n"
