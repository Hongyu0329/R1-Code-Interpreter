    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to carefully follow the steps of traversing the matrix in a spiral pattern. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 5x5 matrix:\n     ```\n     9 3 6 3 5\n     7 1 4 6 0\n     0 0 7 9 4\n     4 1 7 5 6\n     3 7 7 8 3\n     ```\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - We need to keep track of the boundaries of the matrix as we traverse it:\n     - `top` starts at 0\n     - `bottom` starts at 4 (last row index)\n     - `left` starts at 0\n     - `right` starts at 4 (last column index)\n\n3. **Traverse the Matrix in Spiral Order**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row, then increment `top`.\n     - Elements: 9, 3, 6, 3, 5\n     - New `top`: 1\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column, then decrement `right`.\n     - Elements: 0, 4, 6, 3\n     - New `right`: 3\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row, then decrement `bottom`.\n     - Elements: 8, 7, 7, 3\n     - New `bottom`: 3\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column, then increment `left`.\n     - Elements: 4, 0, 7\n     - New `left`: 1\n\n4. **Repeat the Process for Inner Layers**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row, then increment `top`.\n     - Elements: 1, 4, 6\n     - New `top`: 2\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column, then decrement `right`.\n     - Elements: 9, 5\n     - New `right`: 2\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row, then decrement `bottom`.\n     - Elements: 7, 1\n     - New `bottom`: 2\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column, then increment `left`.\n     - Elements: 0\n     - New `left`: 2\n\n5. **Final Inner Layer**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row.\n     - Elements: 7\n\n6. **Compile the Result**:\n   - Combine all the elements collected in the order they were traversed.\n\nThe final spiral order of the matrix is:\n<<<9 3 6 3 5 0 4 6 3 8 7 7 3 4 0 7 1 4 6 9 5 7 1 0 7>>>"
