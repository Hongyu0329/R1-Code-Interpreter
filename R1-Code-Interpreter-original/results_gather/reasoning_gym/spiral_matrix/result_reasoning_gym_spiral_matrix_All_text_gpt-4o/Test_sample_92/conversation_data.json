    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 6x6 matrix.\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - Start with four boundaries: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.\n   - Initially, `top = 0`, `bottom = 5` (last row index), `left = 0`, and `right = 5` (last column index).\n\n3. **Traverse the Matrix in Spiral Order**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row. After traversing, increment the `top` boundary.\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column. After traversing, decrement the `right` boundary.\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row, if `top` <= `bottom`. After traversing, decrement the `bottom` boundary.\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column, if `left` <= `right`. After traversing, increment the `left` boundary.\n   - Repeat the above steps until the `top` boundary exceeds the `bottom` boundary or the `left` boundary exceeds the `right` boundary.\n\n4. **Collect the Elements**:\n   - As you traverse, collect the elements in the order they are visited.\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - Once all elements are collected, format them as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- **Initial Matrix**:\n  ```\n  6 7 1 5 2 8\n  6 0 0 0 3 8\n  5 3 7 1 3 4\n  6 6 0 9 8 4\n  2 2 6 6 5 6\n  2 5 8 4 3 0\n  ```\n\n- **Spiral Order Traversal**:\n  1. Move Right: `6 7 1 5 2 8`\n  2. Move Down: `8 4 4 6 0`\n  3. Move Left: `3 5 4 8 5`\n  4. Move Up: `2 6 6`\n  5. Move Right: `6 0 0 0`\n  6. Move Down: `3 3 8`\n  7. Move Left: `9 0 6`\n  8. Move Up: `6 3`\n  9. Move Right: `7 1`\n  10. Move Down: `3`\n\n- **Collected Elements**: `6 7 1 5 2 8 8 4 4 6 0 3 5 4 8 5 2 6 6 6 0 0 0 3 3 8 9 0 6 6 3 7 1 3`\n\n- **Formatted Output**: \n  - The final output should be formatted as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<6 7 1 5 2 8 8 4 4 6 0 3 5 4 8 5 2 6 6 6 0 0 0 3 3 8 9 0 6 6 3 7 1 3>>>"
