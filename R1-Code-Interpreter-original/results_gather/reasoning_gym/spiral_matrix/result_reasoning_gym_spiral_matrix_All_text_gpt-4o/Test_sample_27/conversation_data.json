    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 5x5 matrix:\n     ```\n     0 9 4 0 4\n     8 5 1 1 4\n     7 2 8 0 2\n     2 5 6 7 5\n     1 1 0 9 7\n     ```\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - We need to keep track of the boundaries of the matrix as we traverse it in a spiral order.\n   - `top` starts at 0, `bottom` starts at 4 (last row index).\n   - `left` starts at 0, `right` starts at 4 (last column index).\n\n3. **Traverse the Matrix in Spiral Order**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row, then increment `top`.\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column, then decrement `right`.\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row, then decrement `bottom`.\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column, then increment `left`.\n   - Repeat the above steps until `top` exceeds `bottom` or `left` exceeds `right`.\n\n4. **Collect the Elements**:\n   - As we traverse, collect the elements in the order they are visited.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Format the collected elements as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- **First Layer**:\n  - Move Right: `0 9 4 0 4`\n  - Move Down: `4 2 5 7`\n  - Move Left: `9 0 1`\n  - Move Up: `2 7 8`\n\n- **Second Layer**:\n  - Move Right: `5 1`\n  - Move Down: `0 6`\n  - Move Left: `5`\n\n- **Innermost Element**:\n  - `8`\n\nCombining all these elements in the order they were visited, we get the spiral order:\n\nFinal Answer: <<<0 9 4 0 4 4 2 5 7 9 0 1 2 7 8 5 1 0 6 5 8>>>"
