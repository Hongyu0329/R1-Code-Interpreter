    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to carefully follow the steps of the spiral traversal. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     3 4 1 1\n     7 2 9 0\n     7 5 5 3\n     3 2 2 7\n     ```\n   - It has 4 rows and 4 columns.\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - Start with the following boundaries:\n     - `top` = 0 (initial top row)\n     - `bottom` = 3 (initial bottom row)\n     - `left` = 0 (initial left column)\n     - `right` = 3 (initial right column)\n\n3. **Spiral Traversal**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row.\n     - Elements: 3, 4, 1, 1\n     - Update `top` to 1 (move the top boundary down)\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column.\n     - Elements: 0, 3, 7\n     - Update `right` to 2 (move the right boundary left)\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row.\n     - Elements: 2, 2, 3\n     - Update `bottom` to 2 (move the bottom boundary up)\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column.\n     - Elements: 7, 7\n     - Update `left` to 1 (move the left boundary right)\n\n4. **Repeat for Inner Matrix**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row.\n     - Elements: 2, 9\n     - Update `top` to 2\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column.\n     - Element: 5\n     - Update `right` to 1\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row.\n     - Element: 5\n     - Update `bottom` to 1\n\n5. **Final Element**:\n   - The only remaining element is at the position (1, 1), which is 2.\n\n6. **Compile the Result**:\n   - Combine all the elements collected in the order they were visited.\n\nThe final spiral order of the matrix is:\n<<<3 4 1 1 0 3 7 2 2 3 7 7 2 9 5 5 2>>>"
