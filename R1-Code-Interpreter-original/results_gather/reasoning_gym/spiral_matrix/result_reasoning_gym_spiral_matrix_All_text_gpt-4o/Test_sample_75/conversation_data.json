    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to carefully follow the spiral traversal rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 5x5 matrix:\n     ```\n     9 4 5 9 9\n     2 2 0 3 4\n     9 7 4 8 2\n     8 3 1 5 4\n     6 3 1 2 6\n     ```\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - Start with four boundaries: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.\n   - Initially, `top = 0`, `bottom = 4`, `left = 0`, `right = 4`.\n\n3. **Traverse the Matrix in Spiral Order**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row.\n     - Elements: 9, 4, 5, 9, 9\n     - Update `top` boundary: `top = 1`\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column.\n     - Elements: 4, 2, 4, 6\n     - Update `right` boundary: `right = 3`\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row.\n     - Elements: 2, 1, 3, 6\n     - Update `bottom` boundary: `bottom = 3`\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column.\n     - Elements: 8, 9, 2\n     - Update `left` boundary: `left = 1`\n\n4. **Repeat the Process for Inner Layers**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row.\n     - Elements: 2, 0, 3\n     - Update `top` boundary: `top = 2`\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column.\n     - Elements: 8, 5\n     - Update `right` boundary: `right = 2`\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row.\n     - Elements: 1, 3\n     - Update `bottom` boundary: `bottom = 2`\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column.\n     - Element: 7\n     - Update `left` boundary: `left = 2`\n\n5. **Final Inner Element**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse the remaining element in the center.\n     - Element: 4\n\n6. **Compile the Result**:\n   - Combine all the elements collected in spiral order.\n\nThe final spiral order of the matrix is:\n<<<9 4 5 9 9 4 2 4 6 2 1 3 6 8 9 2 2 0 3 8 5 1 3 7 4>>>\n\nThis is the list of elements in spiral order for the given matrix."
