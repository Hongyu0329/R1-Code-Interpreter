    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Structure**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     5 0\n     9 9\n     ```\n   - This is a 2x2 matrix with 2 rows and 2 columns.\n\n2. **Spiral Order Traversal**:\n   - Start from the top-left corner of the matrix.\n   - Move right across the top row.\n   - Move down the last column.\n   - Move left across the bottom row.\n   - Move up the first column.\n   - Continue this pattern until all elements are visited.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Traversal**:\n   - **Step 1**: Start at the top-left corner (element `5`).\n   - **Step 2**: Move right to the next element in the top row (element `0`).\n   - **Step 3**: Move down to the next element in the last column (element `9`).\n   - **Step 4**: Move left to the next element in the bottom row (element `9`).\n\n4. **Collect the Elements**:\n   - As we traverse, we collect the elements in the order we visit them: `5`, `0`, `9`, `9`.\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final list of elements in spiral order should be formatted as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the spiral order of the given matrix.\n\n**Final Answer**: <<<5 0 9 9>>>"
