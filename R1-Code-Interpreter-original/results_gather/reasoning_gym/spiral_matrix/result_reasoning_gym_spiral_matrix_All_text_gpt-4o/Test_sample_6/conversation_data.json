    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to carefully follow the spiral traversal rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Initialization**: \n   - Start at the top-left corner of the matrix.\n   - Define boundaries for the traversal: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.\n   - Initially, `top = 0`, `bottom = number of rows - 1`, `left = 0`, `right = number of columns - 1`.\n\n2. **Spiral Traversal**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row. After traversing, increment `top` to move to the next row.\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column. After traversing, decrement `right` to move to the previous column.\n   - **Move Left**: If `top` is still less than or equal to `bottom`, traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row. After traversing, decrement `bottom` to move to the previous row.\n   - **Move Up**: If `left` is still less than or equal to `right`, traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column. After traversing, increment `left` to move to the next column.\n   - Repeat the above steps until all elements are visited.\n\n3. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure that after each move, the boundaries are checked to prevent re-traversing already visited elements.\n   - Handle cases where the matrix might be a single row or column.\n\n4. **Output**:\n   - Collect all visited elements in a list and format them as a space-separated string enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n```\n9 5 1 5 9 9 9 8\n6 4 5 4 3 6 5 6\n7 2 6 1 4 0 2 4\n1 6 8 3 7 2 2 1\n1 6 7 0 4 2 4 5\n8 0 3 2 9 1 1 8\n7 4 8 5 1 7 2 7\n7 4 5 3 9 6 9 5\n```\n\n- Start at the top-left corner: `9`.\n- Move right across the top row: `9 5 1 5 9 9 9 8`.\n- Move down the right column: `6 4 1 8 7 5`.\n- Move left across the bottom row: `9 6 3 5 4 7`.\n- Move up the left column: `7 7 8 1 7 6`.\n- Continue the spiral inward, repeating the process until all elements are visited.\n\nFollowing these steps, the spiral order of the matrix is:\n\n<<<9 5 1 5 9 9 9 8 6 4 1 8 7 5 9 6 3 5 4 7 7 7 8 1 7 6 4 5 4 3 6 5 2 6 8 3 7 2 2 4 2 1 1 9 2 3 0 6 4 0 2 4>>>"
