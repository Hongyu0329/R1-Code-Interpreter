    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 6x6 matrix.\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - We need to keep track of the boundaries of the matrix as we traverse it in a spiral order.\n   - Initialize `top` to 0, `bottom` to 5 (last row index), `left` to 0, and `right` to 5 (last column index).\n\n3. **Traverse the Matrix in Spiral Order**:\n   - **Move Right**: Start from the top-left corner and move right across the topmost row from the `left` boundary to the `right` boundary. After traversing, increment the `top` boundary by 1.\n   - **Move Down**: Move down the rightmost column from the `top` boundary to the `bottom` boundary. After traversing, decrement the `right` boundary by 1.\n   - **Move Left**: If the `top` boundary is still less than or equal to the `bottom` boundary, move left across the bottommost row from the `right` boundary to the `left` boundary. After traversing, decrement the `bottom` boundary by 1.\n   - **Move Up**: If the `left` boundary is still less than or equal to the `right` boundary, move up the leftmost column from the `bottom` boundary to the `top` boundary. After traversing, increment the `left` boundary by 1.\n   - Repeat the above steps until all elements are visited.\n\n4. **Collect the Elements**:\n   - As we traverse the matrix, collect the elements in the order they are visited.\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - Once all elements are collected, format them as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start at the top-left corner and move right: 2, 0, 3, 4, 9, 6\n- Move down the rightmost column: 9, 8, 7, 3, 7, 5\n- Move left across the bottom row: 1, 4, 8, 7, 5\n- Move up the leftmost column: 8, 2, 6\n- Move right across the second row from the top: 8, 2, 3, 0\n- Move down the second column from the right: 7, 1\n- Move left across the second row from the bottom: 9, 8, 8\n- Move up the second column from the left: 4\n- Move right across the third row from the top: 8, 7\n- Move down the third column from the right: 2\n- Move left across the third row from the bottom: 9, 8\n- Finally, move up the third column from the left: 7\n\nThe spiral order of the matrix is:\n\n<<<2 0 3 4 9 6 9 8 7 3 7 5 1 4 8 7 5 6 2 8 2 3 0 7 1 9 8 8 4 8 7 2 9 8 7>>>\n\nThis is the final answer."
