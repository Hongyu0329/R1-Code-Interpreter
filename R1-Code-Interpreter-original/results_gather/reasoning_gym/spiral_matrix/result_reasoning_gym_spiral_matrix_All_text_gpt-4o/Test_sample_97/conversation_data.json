    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to carefully follow the steps of the spiral traversal. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 10x10 matrix.\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - Start with four boundaries: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.\n   - Initially, `top = 0`, `bottom = 9`, `left = 0`, and `right = 9`.\n\n3. **Spiral Traversal**:\n   - We will traverse the matrix in a spiral order by adjusting the boundaries after each complete traversal of a side.\n   - The traversal will continue until `top` exceeds `bottom` or `left` exceeds `right`.\n\n4. **Traverse Right**:\n   - Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` boundary.\n   - After traversing, increment the `top` boundary by 1.\n\n5. **Traverse Down**:\n   - Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` boundary.\n   - After traversing, decrement the `right` boundary by 1.\n\n6. **Traverse Left**:\n   - Check if `top` is still less than or equal to `bottom` to ensure there are rows left to traverse.\n   - Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` boundary.\n   - After traversing, decrement the `bottom` boundary by 1.\n\n7. **Traverse Up**:\n   - Check if `left` is still less than or equal to `right` to ensure there are columns left to traverse.\n   - Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` boundary.\n   - After traversing, increment the `left` boundary by 1.\n\n8. **Repeat**:\n   - Repeat steps 4 to 7 until the boundaries overlap.\n\n9. **Output the Result**:\n   - Collect all the elements in the order they were traversed and format them as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nFollowing these steps, the spiral order traversal of the given matrix is:\n\n<<<4 6 3 3 8 6 5 1 3 9 2 3 8 9 7 3 2 7 9 2 7 9 6 4 4 0 7 0 8 6 8 5 6 2 9 2 9 5 8 6 2 7 2 9 0 1 2 3 2 1 4 3 6 4 0 7 1 5 3 3 8 3 2 7 1 1 5 4 9 8 3 9 4 6 3 3 9 8 4 1 2 0 2 6 3 2 1 4 9 2 5 4 3 2 8 0 9 0 2 4>>>"
