    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to carefully follow the spiral traversal pattern. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix has 7 rows and 7 columns.\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - Start with four boundaries: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.\n   - Initially, `top = 0`, `bottom = 6` (last row index), `left = 0`, and `right = 6` (last column index).\n\n3. **Spiral Traversal**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row. After traversing, increment `top` by 1.\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column. After traversing, decrement `right` by 1.\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row, if `top` <= `bottom`. After traversing, decrement `bottom` by 1.\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column, if `left` <= `right`. After traversing, increment `left` by 1.\n   - Repeat the above steps until `top` > `bottom` or `left` > `right`.\n\n4. **Collect Elements**:\n   - As we traverse, collect the elements in the order they are visited.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Format the collected elements as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- **Initial Matrix**:\n  ```\n  5 3 0 1 5 5 9\n  7 8 6 9 7 5 1\n  8 9 3 5 5 8 5\n  7 0 0 9 3 6 6\n  3 8 6 6 8 9 8\n  0 8 6 3 8 8 0\n  0 9 5 1 2 4 4\n  ```\n\n- **Spiral Order Traversal**:\n  1. Move Right: `5 3 0 1 5 5 9`\n  2. Move Down: `1 5 6 6 5 4`\n  3. Move Left: `4 2 1 5 9 0`\n  4. Move Up: `0 8 3 7`\n  5. Move Right: `8 9 3 5 5`\n  6. Move Down: `8 6 8`\n  7. Move Left: `9 8 6`\n  8. Move Up: `0 0`\n  9. Move Right: `9 3`\n  10. Move Down: `9`\n  11. Move Left: `6`\n  12. Move Up: `0`\n\n- **Final Spiral Order**:\n  - The elements in spiral order are: `5 3 0 1 5 5 9 1 5 6 6 5 4 4 2 1 5 9 0 0 8 3 7 8 9 3 5 5 8 6 8 9 8 6 0 0 9 3 9 6 0`\n\n- **Formatted Output**:\n  - <<<5 3 0 1 5 5 9 1 5 6 6 5 4 4 2 1 5 9 0 0 8 3 7 8 9 3 5 5 8 6 8 9 8 6 0 0 9 3 9 6 0>>>\n\n**Answer**: <<<5 3 0 1 5 5 9 1 5 6 6 5 4 4 2 1 5 9 0 0 8 3 7 8 9 3 5 5 8 6 8 9 8 6 0 0 9 3 9 6 0>>>"
