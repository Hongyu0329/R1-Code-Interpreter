    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to carefully follow the spiral traversal rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is 6 rows by 6 columns.\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - Start with four boundaries: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.\n   - Initially, `top = 0`, `bottom = 5`, `left = 0`, and `right = 5`.\n\n3. **Traverse the Matrix in Spiral Order**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row. After traversing, increment `top` by 1.\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column. After traversing, decrement `right` by 1.\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row, if `top` <= `bottom`. After traversing, decrement `bottom` by 1.\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column, if `left` <= `right`. After traversing, increment `left` by 1.\n   - Repeat the above steps until `top` > `bottom` or `left` > `right`.\n\n4. **Collect the Elements**:\n   - As you traverse, collect the elements in the order they are visited.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Format the collected elements as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- **Initial Matrix**:\n  ```\n  1 6 6 9 3 9\n  0 0 5 5 6 8\n  5 9 7 1 2 3\n  8 2 2 5 5 2\n  3 6 5 4 4 3\n  2 0 9 8 6 8\n  ```\n\n- **Spiral Order Traversal**:\n  1. Move Right: `1 6 6 9 3 9`\n  2. Move Down: `8 3 2 2 8`\n  3. Move Left: `8 6 8 9 0`\n  4. Move Up: `3 8 5 0`\n  5. Move Right: `0 5 5 6`\n  6. Move Down: `2 5`\n  7. Move Left: `5 4 4`\n  8. Move Up: `5 7`\n  9. Move Right: `1 2`\n  10. Move Down: `5`\n  11. Move Left: `5`\n\n- **Collected Elements**: `1 6 6 9 3 9 8 3 2 2 8 8 6 8 9 0 3 8 5 0 0 5 5 6 2 5 5 4 4 5 7 1 2 5 5`\n\n- **Formatted Output**: \n  - The final spiral order list is: <<<1 6 6 9 3 9 8 3 2 2 8 8 6 8 9 0 3 8 5 0 0 5 5 6 2 5 5 4 4 5 7 1 2 5 5>>>\n\nTherefore, the list of elements in spiral order is:\n<<<1 6 6 9 3 9 8 3 2 2 8 8 6 8 9 0 3 8 5 0 0 5 5 6 2 5 5 4 4 5 7 1 2 5 5>>>"
