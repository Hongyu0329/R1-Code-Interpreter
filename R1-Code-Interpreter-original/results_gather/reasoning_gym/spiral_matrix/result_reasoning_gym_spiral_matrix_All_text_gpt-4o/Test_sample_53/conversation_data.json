    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to carefully follow the spiral traversal rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 5x5 matrix:\n     ```\n     6 7 3 1 8\n     7 9 7 6 3\n     1 6 5 9 5\n     8 3 9 3 0\n     9 9 9 8 1\n     ```\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - Start with four boundaries: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.\n   - Initially, `top = 0`, `bottom = 4`, `left = 0`, `right = 4`.\n\n3. **Spiral Traversal**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` boundary.\n     - Elements: 6, 7, 3, 1, 8\n     - Update `top` boundary: `top = 1`\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` boundary.\n     - Elements: 3, 5, 0, 1\n     - Update `right` boundary: `right = 3`\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` boundary.\n     - Elements: 8, 9, 9, 9\n     - Update `bottom` boundary: `bottom = 3`\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` boundary.\n     - Elements: 8, 1, 7\n     - Update `left` boundary: `left = 1`\n\n4. **Repeat for Inner Layers**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` boundary.\n     - Elements: 9, 7, 6\n     - Update `top` boundary: `top = 2`\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` boundary.\n     - Elements: 9, 3\n     - Update `right` boundary: `right = 2`\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` boundary.\n     - Elements: 9, 3\n     - Update `bottom` boundary: `bottom = 2`\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` boundary.\n     - Element: 6\n     - Update `left` boundary: `left = 2`\n\n5. **Final Element**:\n   - The only remaining element is at the center of the matrix.\n   - Element: 5\n\n6. **Compile the Result**:\n   - Combine all the elements collected in spiral order.\n\nThe final spiral order of the matrix is: <<<6 7 3 1 8 3 5 0 1 8 9 9 9 8 1 7 9 7 6 9 3 9 3 6 5>>>"
