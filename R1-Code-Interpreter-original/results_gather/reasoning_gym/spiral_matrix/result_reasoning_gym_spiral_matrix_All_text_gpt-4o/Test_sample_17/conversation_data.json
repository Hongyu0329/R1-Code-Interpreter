    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to carefully follow the steps outlined for traversing the matrix in a spiral manner. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Layout:**\n   The given matrix is:\n   ```\n   0 5 4\n   6 8 5\n   8 0 1\n   ```\n   This is a 3x3 matrix.\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries:**\n   - `top` starts at 0 (the first row).\n   - `bottom` starts at 2 (the last row).\n   - `left` starts at 0 (the first column).\n   - `right` starts at 2 (the last column).\n\n3. **Traverse the Matrix in Spiral Order:**\n   - **Move Right:** Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row.\n     - Elements: 0, 5, 4\n     - Update `top` to 1 (move down to the next row).\n\n   - **Move Down:** Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column.\n     - Elements: 5, 1\n     - Update `right` to 1 (move left to the previous column).\n\n   - **Move Left:** Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row.\n     - Elements: 0, 8\n     - Update `bottom` to 1 (move up to the previous row).\n\n   - **Move Up:** Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column.\n     - Elements: 6\n     - Update `left` to 1 (move right to the next column).\n\n4. **Repeat for Inner Matrix:**\n   - Now, the boundaries are `top = 1`, `bottom = 1`, `left = 1`, `right = 1`.\n   - **Move Right:** Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row.\n     - Element: 8\n\n5. **Compile the Result:**\n   - The elements collected in spiral order are: 0, 5, 4, 5, 1, 0, 8, 6, 8.\n\n6. **Format the Output:**\n   - The final output should be a space-separated list of these elements enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nTherefore, the list of elements in spiral order for the given matrix is:\n\n<<<0 5 4 5 1 0 8 6 8>>>"
