    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 7x7 matrix (7 rows and 7 columns).\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - We need to keep track of the boundaries of the matrix as we traverse it in a spiral order.\n   - Initialize `top` to 0, `bottom` to 6 (last row index), `left` to 0, and `right` to 6 (last column index).\n\n3. **Spiral Traversal**:\n   - We will traverse the matrix in a spiral order by adjusting the boundaries after each complete traversal of a row or column.\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row, then increment `top`.\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column, then decrement `right`.\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row, then decrement `bottom`.\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column, then increment `left`.\n   - Repeat the above steps until `top` exceeds `bottom` or `left` exceeds `right`.\n\n4. **Collect Elements**:\n   - As we traverse, collect the elements in the order they are visited.\n\n5. **Output Format**:\n   - The final list of elements should be output as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- **Initial Matrix**:\n  ```\n  6 9 5 3 0 3 5\n  4 6 8 5 8 1 4\n  5 7 0 6 7 3 4\n  1 2 2 5 5 5 6\n  9 2 5 7 3 4 8\n  0 5 4 0 8 8 9\n  1 8 7 1 0 1 2\n  ```\n\n- **Spiral Order Traversal**:\n  1. Move Right: 6, 9, 5, 3, 0, 3, 5\n  2. Move Down: 4, 4, 6, 8, 9\n  3. Move Left: 8, 8, 0, 4, 5, 0\n  4. Move Up: 9, 1\n  5. Move Right: 6, 8, 5, 8, 1\n  6. Move Down: 3, 4, 8\n  7. Move Left: 4, 3, 7, 5\n  8. Move Up: 2\n  9. Move Right: 0, 6, 7\n  10. Move Down: 5\n  11. Move Left: 5, 2\n  12. Move Up: 2\n\n- **Final Spiral Order**:\n  - The elements in spiral order are: 6, 9, 5, 3, 0, 3, 5, 4, 4, 6, 8, 9, 8, 8, 0, 4, 5, 0, 9, 1, 6, 8, 5, 8, 1, 3, 4, 8, 4, 3, 7, 5, 2, 0, 6, 7, 5, 5, 2, 2\n\n- **Output**:\n  - The final output in the required format is:\n  \n  <<<6 9 5 3 0 3 5 4 4 6 8 9 8 8 0 4 5 0 9 1 6 8 5 8 1 3 4 8 4 3 7 5 2 0 6 7 5 5 2 2>>>"
