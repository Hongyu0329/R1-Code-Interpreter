    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: The given matrix is a 10x10 matrix. This means there are 10 rows and 10 columns.\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**: \n   - `top` boundary starts at the first row (index 0).\n   - `bottom` boundary starts at the last row (index 9).\n   - `left` boundary starts at the first column (index 0).\n   - `right` boundary starts at the last column (index 9).\n\n3. **Spiral Traversal**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from the `left` to the `right` boundary along the `top` row. After traversing, increment the `top` boundary by 1 to move to the next row.\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from the `top` to the `bottom` boundary along the `right` column. After traversing, decrement the `right` boundary by 1 to move to the previous column.\n   - **Move Left**: If the `top` boundary is still less than or equal to the `bottom`, traverse from the `right` to the `left` boundary along the `bottom` row. After traversing, decrement the `bottom` boundary by 1 to move to the previous row.\n   - **Move Up**: If the `left` boundary is still less than or equal to the `right`, traverse from the `bottom` to the `top` boundary along the `left` column. After traversing, increment the `left` boundary by 1 to move to the next column.\n\n4. **Repeat**: Continue the above steps until the `top` boundary exceeds the `bottom` boundary or the `left` boundary exceeds the `right` boundary.\n\n5. **Output Format**: Collect all the elements in the order they are visited and format them as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start at the top-left corner and move right: `3 9 2 0 5 9 3 0 4 2`\n- Move down the right column: `9 9 2 9 3 2 1 2`\n- Move left along the bottom row: `4 4 2 9 6 8 0 6 3`\n- Move up the left column: `7 9 5 3 6 3 9 3`\n- Move right along the second row from the top: `8 7 9 9 2 8 7 2`\n- Move down the second column from the right: `5 0 1 9 5 8 8`\n- Move left along the second row from the bottom: `8 8 9 0 6 0`\n- Move up the second column from the left: `5 6 1 4 1`\n- Move right along the third row from the top: `8 9 7 3 7`\n- Move down the third column from the right: `0 5 2 8`\n- Move left along the third row from the bottom: `9 8 9 0`\n- Move up the third column from the left: `1 1 4`\n- Move right along the fourth row from the top: `8 7 0`\n- Move down the fourth column from the right: `5 3`\n- Move left along the fourth row from the bottom: `8 8`\n- Move up the fourth column from the left: `1 4`\n- Move right along the fifth row from the top: `6 4`\n- Move down the fifth column from the right: `9`\n- Move left along the fifth row from the bottom: `2 3`\n- Move up the fifth column from the left: `1`\n\nCombining all these elements, the spiral order of the matrix is:\n\n<<<3 9 2 0 5 9 3 0 4 2 9 9 2 9 3 2 1 2 4 4 2 9 6 8 0 6 3 7 9 5 3 6 3 9 3 8 7 9 9 2 8 7 2 5 0 1 9 5 8 8 8 8 9 0 6 0 5 6 1 4 1 8 9 7 3 7 0 5 2 8 9 8 9 0 1 1 4 8 7 0 5 3 8 8 1 4 6 4 9 2 3 1>>>"
