    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: The given matrix is a 9x9 matrix. This means there are 9 rows and 9 columns.\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**: \n   - `top` starts at 0 (the first row).\n   - `bottom` starts at 8 (the last row).\n   - `left` starts at 0 (the first column).\n   - `right` starts at 8 (the last column).\n\n3. **Spiral Traversal**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row. After traversing, increment `top` by 1 to move to the next row.\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column. After traversing, decrement `right` by 1 to move to the previous column.\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row. After traversing, decrement `bottom` by 1 to move to the previous row.\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column. After traversing, increment `left` by 1 to move to the next column.\n\n4. **Repeat**: Continue the above steps until `top` exceeds `bottom` or `left` exceeds `right`.\n\n5. **Collect Elements**: As you traverse, collect the elements in the order they are visited.\n\n6. **Output Format**: Once all elements are collected, format them as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start at the top-left corner and move right: 5, 9, 9, 9, 2, 3, 5, 3, 0\n- Move down the right column: 8, 2, 5, 5, 3, 0, 8\n- Move left along the bottom row: 7, 5, 2, 6, 1, 1, 4\n- Move up the left column: 3, 6, 6, 8, 1\n- Move right along the second row from the top: 8, 5, 9, 7, 1, 1, 2\n- Move down the second column from the right: 5, 7, 9, 3, 4\n- Move left along the second row from the bottom: 5, 8, 4, 4\n- Move up the second column from the left: 9, 0, 7\n- Move right along the third row from the top: 6, 5, 3, 1\n- Move down the third column from the right: 8, 4\n- Move left along the third row from the bottom: 8, 9\n- Move up the third column from the left: 9, 8\n- Move right along the fourth row from the top: 6, 3\n- Move down the fourth column from the right: 4\n- Move left along the fourth row from the bottom: 5\n- Move up the fourth column from the left: 0\n- Finally, the center element: 4\n\nThe spiral order of the matrix is:\n\n<<<5 9 9 9 2 3 5 3 0 8 2 5 5 3 0 8 7 5 2 6 1 1 4 3 6 6 8 1 8 5 9 7 1 1 2 5 7 9 3 4 5 8 4 4 9 0 7 6 5 3 1 8 4 8 9 9 8 6 3 4 5 0 4>>>"
