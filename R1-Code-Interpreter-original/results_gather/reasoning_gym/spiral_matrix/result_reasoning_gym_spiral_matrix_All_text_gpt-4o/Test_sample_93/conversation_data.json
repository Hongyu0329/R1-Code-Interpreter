    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 5x5 matrix:\n     ```\n     1 1 6 0 2\n     0 9 8 9 2\n     9 9 2 2 4\n     4 2 5 3 7\n     4 7 2 7 4\n     ```\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - Start with four boundaries: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.\n   - Initially, `top = 0`, `bottom = 4`, `left = 0`, `right = 4`.\n\n3. **Traverse the Matrix in Spiral Order**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row. Increment `top` after traversing.\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column. Decrement `right` after traversing.\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row. Decrement `bottom` after traversing.\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column. Increment `left` after traversing.\n   - Repeat the above steps until `top` exceeds `bottom` or `left` exceeds `right`.\n\n4. **Collect Elements**:\n   - As you traverse, collect the elements in the order they are visited.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Format the collected elements as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- **Move Right** along the top row (row 0): `1 1 6 0 2`\n- **Move Down** along the right column (column 4): `2 4 7 4`\n- **Move Left** along the bottom row (row 4): `7 2 7 4`\n- **Move Up** along the left column (column 0): `4 9 0`\n- **Move Right** along the second row (row 1): `9 8 9`\n- **Move Down** along the second last column (column 3): `2 3`\n- **Move Left** along the second last row (row 3): `5 2`\n- **Move Up** along the second column (column 1): `9`\n- **Move Right** along the third row (row 2): `2`\n\nThe collected elements in spiral order are: `1 1 6 0 2 2 4 7 4 7 2 7 4 9 0 9 8 9 2 3 5 2 9 2`\n\nThe final output is:\n<<<1 1 6 0 2 2 4 7 4 7 2 7 4 9 0 9 8 9 2 3 5 2 9 2>>>"
