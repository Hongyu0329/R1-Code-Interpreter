    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to carefully follow the steps outlined for traversing the matrix in a spiral manner. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 4x4 matrix:\n     ```\n     5 0 1 8\n     7 8 3 6\n     8 5 9 5\n     4 4 1 1\n     ```\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - We need to keep track of the boundaries of the matrix as we traverse it:\n     - `top` starts at 0\n     - `bottom` starts at 3 (last row index)\n     - `left` starts at 0\n     - `right` starts at 3 (last column index)\n\n3. **Traverse the Matrix in Spiral Order**:\n   - **Move Right**: Start from the top-left corner and move right across the top row.\n     - Elements: 5, 0, 1, 8\n     - Update `top` to 1 (move the top boundary down)\n\n   - **Move Down**: Move down the rightmost column.\n     - Elements: 6, 5, 1\n     - Update `right` to 2 (move the right boundary left)\n\n   - **Move Left**: Move left across the bottom row.\n     - Elements: 4, 4, 8\n     - Update `bottom` to 2 (move the bottom boundary up)\n\n   - **Move Up**: Move up the leftmost column.\n     - Elements: 7\n     - Update `left` to 1 (move the left boundary right)\n\n   - **Repeat the Process for Inner Layers**:\n     - **Move Right**: Across the new top row.\n       - Elements: 8, 3\n       - Update `top` to 2\n\n     - **Move Down**: Down the new rightmost column.\n       - Elements: 9\n       - Update `right` to 1\n\n     - **Move Left**: Across the new bottom row.\n       - Elements: 5\n       - Update `bottom` to 1\n\n     - **Move Up**: Up the new leftmost column.\n       - Elements: (No elements left to move up)\n\n4. **Compile the Result**:\n   - Combine all the elements collected in the order they were visited: 5, 0, 1, 8, 6, 5, 1, 4, 4, 8, 7, 8, 3, 9, 5\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final output should be a space-separated list of integers enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final spiral order of the matrix is:\n<<<5 0 1 8 6 5 1 4 4 8 7 8 3 9 5>>>"
