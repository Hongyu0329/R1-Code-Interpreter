    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 6x6 matrix.\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - We need to keep track of the boundaries of the matrix as we traverse it in a spiral order.\n   - Initialize `top` to 0, `bottom` to 5 (last row index), `left` to 0, and `right` to 5 (last column index).\n\n3. **Traverse the Matrix in Spiral Order**:\n   - We will use a loop to traverse the matrix until all elements are visited.\n   - In each iteration, we will adjust the boundaries after completing a direction.\n\n4. **Direction 1 - Move Right**:\n   - Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row.\n   - After traversing, increment `top` by 1 to move to the next row.\n\n5. **Direction 2 - Move Down**:\n   - Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column.\n   - After traversing, decrement `right` by 1 to move to the previous column.\n\n6. **Direction 3 - Move Left**:\n   - Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row.\n   - After traversing, decrement `bottom` by 1 to move to the previous row.\n\n7. **Direction 4 - Move Up**:\n   - Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column.\n   - After traversing, increment `left` by 1 to move to the next column.\n\n8. **Repeat**:\n   - Continue the process until `top` exceeds `bottom` or `left` exceeds `right`.\n\n9. **Output the Result**:\n   - Collect all the elements in the order they are visited and format them as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start at the top-left corner (8) and move right: 8, 7, 4, 2, 2, 5\n- Move down the right column: 1, 4, 9, 8, 0\n- Move left along the bottom row: 3, 2, 3, 3, 0\n- Move up the left column: 9, 2, 9\n- Move right along the second row from the top: 9, 0, 9, 6\n- Move down the second column from the right: 2, 9\n- Move left along the second row from the bottom: 0, 7\n- Move up the second column from the left: 6, 4\n- Move right along the third row from the top: 1, 4\n- Move down the third column from the right: 2\n- Move left along the third row from the bottom: 0\n- Finally, move up the third column from the left: 9\n\nThe spiral order of the matrix is:\n\n<<<8 7 4 2 2 5 1 4 9 8 0 3 2 3 3 0 9 2 9 9 0 9 6 2 9 0 7 6 4 1 4 2 0 9>>>"
