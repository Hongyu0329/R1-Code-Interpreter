    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 7x7 matrix (7 rows and 7 columns).\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - We need to keep track of the boundaries of the matrix as we traverse it in a spiral order.\n   - Initialize `top` to 0, `bottom` to 6 (last row index), `left` to 0, and `right` to 6 (last column index).\n\n3. **Traverse the Matrix in Spiral Order**:\n   - We will use a loop to traverse the matrix until all elements are visited. The loop will continue as long as `top <= bottom` and `left <= right`.\n\n4. **Move Right**:\n   - Traverse from the `left` boundary to the `right` boundary along the `top` row.\n   - After traversing, increment the `top` boundary by 1 to move to the next row.\n\n5. **Move Down**:\n   - Traverse from the `top` boundary to the `bottom` boundary along the `right` column.\n   - After traversing, decrement the `right` boundary by 1 to move to the previous column.\n\n6. **Move Left**:\n   - Check if `top <= bottom` to ensure there is a row to traverse.\n   - Traverse from the `right` boundary to the `left` boundary along the `bottom` row.\n   - After traversing, decrement the `bottom` boundary by 1 to move to the previous row.\n\n7. **Move Up**:\n   - Check if `left <= right` to ensure there is a column to traverse.\n   - Traverse from the `bottom` boundary to the `top` boundary along the `left` column.\n   - After traversing, increment the `left` boundary by 1 to move to the next column.\n\n8. **Repeat**:\n   - Repeat steps 4 to 7 until all elements are visited.\n\n9. **Output the Result**:\n   - Collect all the elements in the order they are visited and format them as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start at the top-left corner and move right: `4 5 3 5 1 8 9`\n- Move down the right column: `9 6 7 8 6 2`\n- Move left along the bottom row: `4 8 5 2 3 5`\n- Move up the left column: `9 5 3 2 3`\n- Move right along the second row from the top: `0 9 0 0 3`\n- Move down the second column from the right: `8 5 7`\n- Move left along the second row from the bottom: `4 5 3 0`\n- Move up the second column from the left: `0 2`\n- Move right along the third row from the top: `1 9 9`\n- Move down the third column from the right: `0 3`\n- Move left along the third row from the bottom: `8 0`\n- Move up the third column from the left: `0`\n- Move right along the fourth row from the top: `4`\n- Move down the fourth column from the right: `5`\n- Move left along the fourth row from the bottom: `8`\n\nThe final spiral order is:\n`4 5 3 5 1 8 9 9 6 7 8 6 2 4 8 5 2 3 5 9 5 3 2 3 0 9 0 0 3 8 5 7 4 5 3 0 0 2 1 9 9 0 3 8 0 0 4 5 8`\n\nTherefore, the output is:\n<<<4 5 3 5 1 8 9 9 6 7 8 6 2 4 8 5 2 3 5 9 5 3 2 3 0 9 0 0 3 8 5 7 4 5 3 0 0 2 1 9 9 0 3 8 0 0 4 5 8>>>"
