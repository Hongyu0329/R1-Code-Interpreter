    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to carefully follow the spiral traversal pattern. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initialization**: \n   - Start from the top-left corner of the matrix.\n   - Define boundaries for the traversal: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.\n   - Initially, `top` is 0, `bottom` is the last row index, `left` is 0, and `right` is the last column index.\n\n2. **Spiral Traversal**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row. After traversing, increment the `top` boundary.\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column. After traversing, decrement the `right` boundary.\n   - **Move Left**: If `top` is still less than or equal to `bottom`, traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row. After traversing, decrement the `bottom` boundary.\n   - **Move Up**: If `left` is still less than or equal to `right`, traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column. After traversing, increment the `left` boundary.\n   - Repeat the above steps until all elements are visited.\n\n3. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure that after each move, the boundaries are checked to prevent re-traversing already visited elements.\n   - Handle cases where the matrix might be a single row or column.\n\n4. **Output**:\n   - Collect the elements in the order they are visited and format them as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n```\n6 7 1 9 6 1 7 6 8 6\n1 0 5 8 1 2 4 3 5 7\n9 9 6 5 7 5 3 3 2 1\n2 9 1 0 9 0 7 6 7 7\n6 3 8 4 4 6 5 5 1 2\n1 0 5 5 9 8 4 0 2 1\n5 8 2 3 3 7 9 7 6 3\n9 4 4 9 5 6 2 3 5 1\n7 2 1 9 5 9 9 7 3 6\n3 0 7 1 9 6 4 0 8 7\n```\n\n- **Move Right**: 6, 7, 1, 9, 6, 1, 7, 6, 8, 6\n- **Move Down**: 7, 1, 7, 2, 1, 3, 6, 7, 1\n- **Move Left**: 7, 6, 8, 4, 9, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7\n- **Move Up**: 0, 9, 2, 5, 8, 1, 9, 9\n- **Move Right**: 9, 9, 6, 5, 7, 5, 3, 3\n- **Move Down**: 5, 5, 0, 7, 9, 5, 9\n- **Move Left**: 9, 4, 4, 9, 5, 6, 2\n- **Move Up**: 8, 0, 3, 9, 1\n- **Move Right**: 1, 0, 5, 8, 4, 6\n- **Move Down**: 5, 5, 9, 8, 4\n- **Move Left**: 7, 9, 3, 3\n- **Move Up**: 2, 8, 5\n- **Move Right**: 1, 0, 5, 5\n- **Move Down**: 3, 7\n- **Move Left**: 9, 0\n- **Move Up**: 1, 9\n- **Move Right**: 6\n\nThe final spiral order of the matrix is:\n\n<<<6 7 1 9 6 1 7 6 8 6 7 1 7 2 1 3 6 7 1 7 6 8 4 9 1 2 3 6 7 0 9 2 5 8 1 9 9 9 9 6 5 7 5 3 3 5 5 0 7 9 5 9 9 4 4 9 5 6 2 8 0 3 9 1 1 0 5 8 4 6 5 5 9 8 4 7 9 3 3 2 8 5 1 0 5 5 3 7 9 0 1 9 6>>>"
