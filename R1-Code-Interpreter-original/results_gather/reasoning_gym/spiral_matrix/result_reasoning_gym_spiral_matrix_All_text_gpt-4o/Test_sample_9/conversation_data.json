    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to carefully follow the spiral traversal pattern. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is 8 rows by 8 columns.\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - Start with four boundaries: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.\n   - Initially, `top = 0`, `bottom = 7` (last row index), `left = 0`, and `right = 7` (last column index).\n\n3. **Spiral Traversal**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row. After traversing, increment `top` by 1.\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column. After traversing, decrement `right` by 1.\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row, if `top` <= `bottom`. After traversing, decrement `bottom` by 1.\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column, if `left` <= `right`. After traversing, increment `left` by 1.\n   - Repeat the above steps until `top` > `bottom` or `left` > `right`.\n\n4. **Collect Elements**:\n   - As you traverse, collect the elements in the order they are visited.\n\n5. **Output Format**:\n   - The collected elements should be output as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- **Initial Matrix**:\n  ```\n  4 0 1 1 5 2 0 1\n  4 9 6 6 7 1 5 9\n  4 0 0 2 4 2 0 0\n  7 1 3 6 7 8 0 1\n  9 1 2 2 9 6 0 0\n  4 4 6 9 8 0 2 2\n  9 9 6 3 9 5 3 5\n  7 3 2 2 6 1 3 2\n  ```\n\n- **Spiral Order Traversal**:\n  - Move Right: `4 0 1 1 5 2 0 1`\n  - Move Down: `9 9 0 1 9 0 5`\n  - Move Left: `2 3 5 3 5 2 2`\n  - Move Up: `9 9 4 7`\n  - Move Right: `0 6 6 7 1 5`\n  - Move Down: `0 0 0 0`\n  - Move Left: `6 8 9 2`\n  - Move Up: `1 1 4`\n  - Move Right: `0 2 4 2`\n  - Move Down: `6 7`\n  - Move Left: `3 6`\n  - Move Up: `0`\n  - Move Right: `2 4`\n  - Move Down: `6`\n  - Move Left: `2`\n\n- **Final Spiral Order**:\n  - The elements in spiral order are: `4 0 1 1 5 2 0 1 9 9 0 1 9 0 5 2 3 5 3 5 2 2 9 9 4 7 0 6 6 7 1 5 0 0 0 0 6 8 9 2 1 1 4 0 2 4 2 6 7 3 6 0 2 4 6 2`\n\n- **Formatted Output**:\n  - The final output should be: <<<4 0 1 1 5 2 0 1 9 9 0 1 9 0 5 2 3 5 3 5 2 2 9 9 4 7 0 6 6 7 1 5 0 0 0 0 6 8 9 2 1 1 4 0 2 4 2 6 7 3 6 0 2 4 6 2>>>\n\nAnswer: <<<4 0 1 1 5 2 0 1 9 9 0 1 9 0 5 2 3 5 3 5 2 2 9 9 4 7 0 6 6 7 1 5 0 0 0 0 6 8 9 2 1 1 4 0 2 4 2 6 7 3 6 0 2 4 6 2>>>"
