    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Layout**: \n   The given matrix is:\n   ```\n   4 1 2\n   3 7 3\n   0 0 5\n   ```\n   This is a 3x3 matrix.\n\n2. **Spiral Order Traversal**:\n   - **Start at the top-left corner** and move right across the first row.\n   - **Move down** the last column.\n   - **Move left** across the bottom row.\n   - **Move up** the first column.\n   - **Repeat** the process for the inner sub-matrix.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Traversal**:\n   - **First Row (Left to Right)**: Start from the top-left corner and move right across the first row.\n     - Elements: 4, 1, 2\n   - **Last Column (Top to Bottom)**: Move down the last column.\n     - Elements: 3, 5\n   - **Bottom Row (Right to Left)**: Move left across the bottom row.\n     - Elements: 0, 0\n   - **First Column (Bottom to Top)**: Move up the first column.\n     - Element: 3\n   - **Inner Sub-Matrix**: Now, we have a single element left in the center.\n     - Element: 7\n\n4. **Combine the Elements**:\n   - Combine all the elements in the order they were visited: 4, 1, 2, 3, 5, 0, 0, 3, 7.\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final output should be a space-separated list of integers enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<4 1 2 3 5 0 0 3 7>>>"
