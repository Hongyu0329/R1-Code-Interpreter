    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to carefully follow the steps of the spiral traversal. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 10x10 matrix.\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - Start with four boundaries: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.\n   - Initially, `top = 0`, `bottom = 9`, `left = 0`, `right = 9`.\n\n3. **Spiral Traversal**:\n   - We will traverse the matrix in a spiral order by adjusting these boundaries after each pass.\n   - Continue the process until `top` exceeds `bottom` or `left` exceeds `right`.\n\n4. **Traverse from Left to Right**:\n   - Start from the `top` row and move from `left` to `right`.\n   - Append each element to the result list.\n   - After completing the row, increment the `top` boundary.\n\n5. **Traverse from Top to Bottom**:\n   - Move down the `right` column from `top` to `bottom`.\n   - Append each element to the result list.\n   - After completing the column, decrement the `right` boundary.\n\n6. **Traverse from Right to Left**:\n   - If `top` is still less than or equal to `bottom`, move from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row.\n   - Append each element to the result list.\n   - After completing the row, decrement the `bottom` boundary.\n\n7. **Traverse from Bottom to Top**:\n   - If `left` is still less than or equal to `right`, move up the `left` column from `bottom` to `top`.\n   - Append each element to the result list.\n   - After completing the column, increment the `left` boundary.\n\n8. **Repeat**:\n   - Repeat steps 4 to 7 until all elements are visited.\n\n9. **Output the Result**:\n   - The result should be a space-separated list of integers enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start at the top-left corner and move right: `4 5 9 2 2 1 0 8 8 1`\n- Move down the right column: `5 5 6 6 4 2 4 6`\n- Move left along the bottom row: `7 3 3 3 5 1 8 8 6`\n- Move up the left column: `4 2 7 3 6 4 7`\n- Continue the spiral inward until all elements are visited.\n\nFollowing these steps, the spiral order of the matrix is:\n\n<<<4 5 9 2 2 1 0 8 8 1 5 5 6 6 4 2 4 6 7 3 3 3 5 1 8 8 6 4 2 7 3 6 4 7 3 7 2 8 6 8 9 1 1 4 2 1 1 3 0 6 0 4 9 2 4 8 9 7 3 6 4 1 2 4 6 9 8 9 5 9 5 3 1 5 6 9 0 4 0 4 9 4 2 2 5 4 9 6 6 2 0 1 7 5>>>"
