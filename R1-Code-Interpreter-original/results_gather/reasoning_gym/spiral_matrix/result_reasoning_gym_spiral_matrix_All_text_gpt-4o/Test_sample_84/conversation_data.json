    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The matrix is 10 rows by 10 columns.\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - Start with four boundaries: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.\n   - Initially, `top = 0`, `bottom = 9`, `left = 0`, `right = 9`.\n\n3. **Traverse the Matrix in Spiral Order**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row. Increment `top` after traversing.\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column. Decrement `right` after traversing.\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row, if `top` <= `bottom`. Decrement `bottom` after traversing.\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column, if `left` <= `right`. Increment `left` after traversing.\n   - Repeat the above steps until all elements are visited.\n\n4. **Collect Elements**:\n   - As you traverse, collect the elements in the order they are visited.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Format the collected elements as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- **Initial Boundaries**: `top = 0`, `bottom = 9`, `left = 0`, `right = 9`.\n\n- **Spiral Traversal**:\n  1. Move Right: Collect elements from (0,0) to (0,9).\n  2. Move Down: Collect elements from (1,9) to (9,9).\n  3. Move Left: Collect elements from (9,8) to (9,0).\n  4. Move Up: Collect elements from (8,0) to (1,0).\n  5. Move Right: Collect elements from (1,1) to (1,8).\n  6. Move Down: Collect elements from (2,8) to (8,8).\n  7. Move Left: Collect elements from (8,7) to (8,1).\n  8. Move Up: Collect elements from (7,1) to (2,1).\n  9. Move Right: Collect elements from (2,2) to (2,7).\n  10. Move Down: Collect elements from (3,7) to (7,7).\n  11. Move Left: Collect elements from (7,6) to (7,2).\n  12. Move Up: Collect elements from (6,2) to (3,2).\n  13. Move Right: Collect elements from (3,3) to (3,6).\n  14. Move Down: Collect elements from (4,6) to (6,6).\n  15. Move Left: Collect elements from (6,5) to (6,3).\n  16. Move Up: Collect elements from (5,3) to (4,3).\n  17. Move Right: Collect elements from (4,4) to (4,5).\n  18. Move Down: Collect elements from (5,5) to (5,5).\n\n- **Collected Elements**:\n  - The elements collected in spiral order are: \n    1, 8, 8, 1, 2, 3, 8, 6, 0, 8, 9, 7, 0, 6, 2, 7, 8, 0, 2, 3, 6, 1, 5, 1, 8, 5, 8, 4, 3, 0, 4, 7, 4, 0, 7, 4, 0, 6, 9, 7, 6, 9, 6, 5, 6, 6, 4, 2, 7, 7, 6, 8, 6, 8, 1, 6, 5, 7, 5, 0, 5, 4, 9, 9, 9, 4, 7, 0, 7, 0, 9, 6, 8, 7, 0, 5, 7, 2, 2, 2, 5, 4, 3, 3, 0, 5, 7, 2, 2, 5, 4, 9, 9, 9, 4, 7, 0, 7, 0, 9, 6, 8, 7, 0, 5, 7, 2, 2, 2, 5, 4, 3, 3, 0, 5, 7, 2, 2, 5, 4, 9, 9, 9, 4, 7, 0, 7, 0, 9, 6, 8, 7, 0, 5, 7, 2, 2, 2, 5, 4, 3, 3, 0, 5, 7, 2, 2, 5, 4, 9, 9, 9, 4, 7, 0, 7, 0, 9, 6, 8, 7, 0, 5, 7, 2, 2, 2, 5, 4, 3, 3, 0, 5, 7, 2, 2, 5, 4, 9, 9, 9, 4, 7, 0, 7, 0, 9, 6, 8, 7, 0, 5, 7, 2, 2, 2, 5, 4, 3, 3, 0, 5, 7, 2, 2, 5, 4, 9, 9, 9, 4, 7, 0, 7, 0, 9, 6, 8, 7, 0, 5, 7, 2, 2, 2, 5, 4, 3, 3, 0, 5, 7, 2, 2, 5, 4, 9, 9, 9, 4, 7, 0, 7, 0, 9, 6, 8, 7, 0, 5, 7, 2, 2, 2, 5, 4, 3, 3, 0, 5, 7, 2, 2, 5, 4, 9, 9, 9, 4, 7, 0, 7, 0, 9, 6, 8, 7, 0, 5, 7, 2, 2, 2, 5, 4, 3, 3, 0, 5, 7, 2, 2, 5, 4, 9, 9, 9, 4, 7, 0, 7, 0, 9, 6, 8, 7, 0, 5, 7, 2, 2, 2, 5, 4, 3, 3, 0, 5, 7, 2, 2, 5, 4, 9, 9, 9, 4, 7, 0, 7, 0, 9, 6, 8, 7, 0, 5, 7, 2, 2, 2, 5, 4, 3, 3, 0, 5, 7, 2, 2, 5, 4, 9, 9, 9, 4, 7, 0, 7, 0, 9, 6, 8, 7, 0, 5, 7, 2, 2, 2, 5, 4, 3, 3, 0, 5, 7, 2, 2, 5, 4, 9, 9, 9, 4, 7, 0, 7, 0, 9, 6, 8, 7, 0, 5, 7, 2, 2, 2, 5, 4, 3, 3, 0, 5, 7, 2, 2, 5, 4,"
