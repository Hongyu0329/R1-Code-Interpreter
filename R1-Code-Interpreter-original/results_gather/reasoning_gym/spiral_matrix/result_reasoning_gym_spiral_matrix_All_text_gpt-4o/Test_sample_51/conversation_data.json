    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: The given matrix is a 9x9 matrix. This means there are 9 rows and 9 columns.\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**: \n   - `top` boundary starts at the first row (index 0).\n   - `bottom` boundary starts at the last row (index 8).\n   - `left` boundary starts at the first column (index 0).\n   - `right` boundary starts at the last column (index 8).\n\n3. **Spiral Traversal**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from the `left` boundary to the `right` boundary along the `top` boundary. After traversing, increment the `top` boundary by 1 to move to the next row.\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from the `top` boundary to the `bottom` boundary along the `right` boundary. After traversing, decrement the `right` boundary by 1 to move to the previous column.\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from the `right` boundary to the `left` boundary along the `bottom` boundary. After traversing, decrement the `bottom` boundary by 1 to move to the previous row.\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from the `bottom` boundary to the `top` boundary along the `left` boundary. After traversing, increment the `left` boundary by 1 to move to the next column.\n\n4. **Repeat**: Continue the above steps until the `top` boundary exceeds the `bottom` boundary or the `left` boundary exceeds the `right` boundary.\n\n5. **Output Format**: Collect all the elements in the order they are visited and format them as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start at the top-left corner and move right: `6 7 4 8 7 0 7 2 6`\n- Move down the right column: `4 5 5 7 1 3 9`\n- Move left along the bottom row: `5 1 5 2 2 8 2 2`\n- Move up the left column: `1 6 3 0 7 1 7`\n- Move right along the second row from the top: `8 2 5 2 2 6 9`\n- Move down the second column from the right: `7 3 0 9 9 9`\n- Move left along the second row from the bottom: `0 9 7 9 6`\n- Move up the second column from the left: `7 7 7`\n- Move right along the third row from the top: `2 0 2 3`\n- Move down the third column from the right: `5 4 4`\n- Move left along the third row from the bottom: `3 3 5`\n- Move up the third column from the left: `9 9`\n- Move right along the fourth row from the top: `9 9`\n- Move down the fourth column from the right: `2`\n- Move left along the fourth row from the bottom: `3 3`\n- Move up the fourth column from the left: `9`\n- Finally, the center element: `0`\n\nCombining all these elements, the spiral order of the matrix is:\n\n<<<6 7 4 8 7 0 7 2 6 4 5 5 7 1 3 9 5 1 5 2 2 8 2 2 1 6 3 0 7 1 7 8 2 5 2 2 6 9 7 3 0 9 9 9 0 9 7 9 6 7 7 7 2 0 2 3 5 4 4 3 3 5 9 9 9 9 2 3 3 9 0>>>"
