    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to carefully follow the spiral traversal rules. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is 7 rows by 7 columns.\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - Start with four boundaries: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.\n   - Initially, `top = 0`, `bottom = 6`, `left = 0`, `right = 6`.\n\n3. **Spiral Traversal**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row. Increment `top` by 1 after traversing.\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column. Decrement `right` by 1 after traversing.\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row. Decrement `bottom` by 1 after traversing.\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column. Increment `left` by 1 after traversing.\n   - Repeat the above steps until `top` exceeds `bottom` or `left` exceeds `right`.\n\n4. **Collect Elements**:\n   - As we traverse, collect the elements in the order they are visited.\n\n5. **Output Format**:\n   - The collected elements should be output as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- **First Layer**:\n  - Move Right: `0 7 9 2 8 9 2`\n  - Move Down: `3 4 0 6 0 5`\n  - Move Left: `6 5 8 6 8 0`\n  - Move Up: `2 7 8 2 4`\n\n- **Second Layer**:\n  - Move Right: `6 4 7 7 2`\n  - Move Down: `0 6 5`\n  - Move Left: `8 8 1`\n  - Move Up: `1 4`\n\n- **Third Layer**:\n  - Move Right: `5 3 1`\n  - Move Down: `5 8`\n  - Move Left: `8 0`\n\n- **Innermost Element**:\n  - `8`\n\nCombining all these elements in the order they were visited, we get the final spiral order list.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 7 9 2 8 9 2 3 4 0 6 0 5 6 5 8 6 8 0 2 7 8 2 4 6 4 7 7 2 0 6 5 8 8 1 1 4 5 3 1 5 8 8 0 8>>>"
