    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to carefully follow the spiral traversal rules. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 6x6 matrix:\n     ```\n     5 7 2 1 7 1\n     8 9 6 6 8 6\n     1 6 0 4 4 5\n     7 9 0 7 0 9\n     3 8 9 7 4 8\n     2 3 8 7 1 6\n     ```\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - Start with four boundaries: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.\n   - Initially, `top = 0`, `bottom = 5`, `left = 0`, `right = 5`.\n\n3. **Spiral Traversal**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row.\n     - Elements: 5, 7, 2, 1, 7, 1\n     - Increment `top` to 1.\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column.\n     - Elements: 6, 5, 9, 8, 6\n     - Decrement `right` to 4.\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row.\n     - Elements: 1, 7, 8, 3, 2\n     - Decrement `bottom` to 4.\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column.\n     - Elements: 3, 7, 1, 8\n     - Increment `left` to 1.\n\n4. **Repeat the Process for Inner Layers**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row.\n     - Elements: 9, 6, 6, 8\n     - Increment `top` to 2.\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column.\n     - Elements: 4, 0, 4\n     - Decrement `right` to 3.\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row.\n     - Elements: 7, 9, 8\n     - Decrement `bottom` to 3.\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column.\n     - Elements: 9, 6\n     - Increment `left` to 2.\n\n5. **Final Inner Layer**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row.\n     - Elements: 0, 4\n     - Increment `top` to 3.\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column.\n     - Element: 7\n     - Decrement `right` to 2.\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row.\n     - Element: 0\n     - Decrement `bottom` to 2.\n\n6. **Collect All Elements**:\n   - Combine all the elements collected in the order of traversal.\n\nThe final spiral order of the matrix is:\n<<<5 7 2 1 7 1 6 5 9 8 6 1 7 8 3 2 3 7 1 8 9 6 6 8 4 0 4 7 9 8 9 6 0 4 7 0>>>\n\nThis is the list of elements in spiral order."
