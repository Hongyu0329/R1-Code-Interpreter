    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to carefully follow the spiral traversal rules. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 6x6 matrix:\n     ```\n     1 2 3 8 1 4\n     3 3 8 9 8 0\n     3 2 5 6 5 4\n     4 7 9 7 5 3\n     9 8 8 0 2 2\n     0 8 2 2 4 2\n     ```\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - Start with four boundaries: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.\n   - Initially, `top = 0`, `bottom = 5`, `left = 0`, `right = 5`.\n\n3. **Traverse the Matrix in Spiral Order**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` boundary, then increment `top`.\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` boundary, then decrement `right`.\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` boundary, then decrement `bottom`.\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` boundary, then increment `left`.\n   - Repeat the above steps until `top` exceeds `bottom` or `left` exceeds `right`.\n\n4. **Collect Elements**:\n   - As you traverse, collect the elements in the order they are visited.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Format the collected elements as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- **Move Right** along the top row: `1 2 3 8 1 4`\n- **Move Down** along the right column: `0 4 3 2`\n- **Move Left** along the bottom row: `2 4 2 2 8`\n- **Move Up** along the left column: `0 9 4 3`\n- **Move Right** along the second row from the top: `3 8 9 8`\n- **Move Down** along the second column from the right: `5 5`\n- **Move Left** along the second row from the bottom: `0 8 8`\n- **Move Up** along the second column from the left: `7 2`\n- **Move Right** along the third row from the top: `5 6`\n- **Move Down** along the third column from the right: `7`\n- **Move Left** along the third row from the bottom: `0 8`\n- **Move Up** along the third column from the left: `9`\n- **Move Right** along the fourth row from the top: `9 7`\n- **Move Down** along the fourth column from the right: `5`\n- **Move Left** along the fourth row from the bottom: `8`\n\nThe final spiral order is:\n`1 2 3 8 1 4 0 4 3 2 2 4 2 2 8 0 9 4 3 3 8 9 8 5 5 0 8 8 7 2 5 6 7 0 8 9 9 7 5 8`\n\nTherefore, the output is:\n<<<1 2 3 8 1 4 0 4 3 2 2 4 2 2 8 0 9 4 3 3 8 9 8 5 5 0 8 8 7 2 5 6 7 0 8 9 9 7 5 8>>>"
