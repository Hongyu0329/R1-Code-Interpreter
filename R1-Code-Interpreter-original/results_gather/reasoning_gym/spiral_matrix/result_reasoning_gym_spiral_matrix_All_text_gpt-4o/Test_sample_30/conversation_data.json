    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to carefully follow the steps outlined for traversing the matrix in a spiral manner. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 4x4 matrix:\n     ```\n     7 2 8 7\n     2 5 2 3\n     4 7 4 0\n     2 0 1 1\n     ```\n\n2. **Initialize Pointers**:\n   - We need to keep track of the boundaries of the matrix as we traverse it. We will use four pointers: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.\n   - Initially, set `top = 0`, `bottom = 3` (last row index), `left = 0`, and `right = 3` (last column index).\n\n3. **Traverse the Matrix in Spiral Order**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row. After traversing, increment `top` by 1.\n     - Elements: 7, 2, 8, 7\n     - Update: `top = 1`\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column. After traversing, decrement `right` by 1.\n     - Elements: 3, 0, 1\n     - Update: `right = 2`\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row. After traversing, decrement `bottom` by 1.\n     - Elements: 1, 0, 2\n     - Update: `bottom = 2`\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column. After traversing, increment `left` by 1.\n     - Elements: 4, 2\n     - Update: `left = 1`\n\n4. **Repeat the Process for Inner Layers**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row. After traversing, increment `top` by 1.\n     - Elements: 5, 2\n     - Update: `top = 2`\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column. After traversing, decrement `right` by 1.\n     - Elements: 4\n     - Update: `right = 1`\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row. After traversing, decrement `bottom` by 1.\n     - Elements: 7\n     - Update: `bottom = 1`\n\n5. **Check for Completion**:\n   - At this point, `top` is greater than `bottom` and `left` is greater than `right`, indicating that all elements have been visited.\n\n6. **Compile the Result**:\n   - The elements collected in spiral order are: 7, 2, 8, 7, 3, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 4, 2, 5, 2, 4, 7.\n\n7. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final output should be a space-separated list of these elements enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<7 2 8 7 3 0 1 1 0 2 4 2 5 2 4 7>>>"
