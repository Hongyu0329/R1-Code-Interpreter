    "To solve this problem, we need to traverse the given matrix in a spiral order. Let's break down the steps to achieve this:\n\n1. **Initialize Boundaries**: \n   - Start with four boundaries: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.\n   - Initially, `top` is 0, `bottom` is the last row index (6 in this case), `left` is 0, and `right` is the last column index (6 in this case).\n\n2. **Traverse the Matrix**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row. After traversing, increment the `top` boundary.\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column. After traversing, decrement the `right` boundary.\n   - **Move Left**: If `top` is still less than or equal to `bottom`, traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row. After traversing, decrement the `bottom` boundary.\n   - **Move Up**: If `left` is still less than or equal to `right`, traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column. After traversing, increment the `left` boundary.\n\n3. **Repeat**: Continue the above steps until the `top` boundary exceeds the `bottom` boundary or the `left` boundary exceeds the `right` boundary.\n\n4. **Collect Elements**: As you traverse, collect the elements in the order they are visited.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Format the collected elements as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- **Initial Matrix**:\n  ```\n  7 7 3 6 4 3 9\n  9 0 3 3 4 8 5\n  2 1 0 8 5 6 1\n  9 5 3 0 4 7 6\n  0 4 8 4 6 2 7\n  9 6 1 1 1 3 6\n  0 9 7 3 7 1 0\n  ```\n\n- **Spiral Order Traversal**:\n  1. Move Right: 7, 7, 3, 6, 4, 3, 9\n  2. Move Down: 5, 1, 6, 7, 6, 0\n  3. Move Left: 1, 3, 1, 1, 6, 7\n  4. Move Up: 9, 0, 9\n  5. Move Right: 2, 1, 0, 8, 5, 6\n  6. Move Down: 7, 2\n  7. Move Left: 4, 0, 3\n  8. Move Up: 5, 9\n  9. Move Right: 3, 4, 8\n  10. Move Down: 4\n  11. Move Left: 3, 5\n  12. Move Up: 3\n\n- **Final Spiral Order**: 7, 7, 3, 6, 4, 3, 9, 5, 1, 6, 7, 6, 0, 1, 3, 1, 1, 6, 7, 9, 0, 9, 2, 1, 0, 8, 5, 6, 7, 2, 4, 0, 3, 5, 9, 3, 4, 8, 4, 3, 5, 3\n\n- **Formatted Output**: <<<7 7 3 6 4 3 9 5 1 6 7 6 0 1 3 1 1 6 7 9 0 9 2 1 0 8 5 6 7 2 4 0 3 5 9 3 4 8 4 3 5 3>>>\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<7 7 3 6 4 3 9 5 1 6 7 6 0 1 3 1 1 6 7 9 0 9 2 1 0 8 5 6 7 2 4 0 3 5 9 3 4 8 4 3 5 3>>>"
