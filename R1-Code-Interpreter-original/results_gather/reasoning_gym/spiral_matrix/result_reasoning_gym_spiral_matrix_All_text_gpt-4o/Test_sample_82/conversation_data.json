    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 5x5 matrix:\n     ```\n     1 9 5 3 2\n     8 1 0 8 5\n     9 1 1 9 8\n     4 7 5 8 5\n     6 8 9 4 1\n     ```\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - Start with four boundaries: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.\n   - Initially, `top = 0`, `bottom = 4`, `left = 0`, `right = 4`.\n\n3. **Traverse the Matrix in Spiral Order**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row. After traversing, increment `top` by 1.\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column. After traversing, decrement `right` by 1.\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row, if `top` <= `bottom`. After traversing, decrement `bottom` by 1.\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column, if `left` <= `right`. After traversing, increment `left` by 1.\n   - Repeat the above steps until `top` > `bottom` or `left` > `right`.\n\n4. **Collect the Elements**:\n   - As we traverse, collect the elements in the order they are visited.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Format the collected elements as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- **Move Right**: 1, 9, 5, 3, 2\n- **Move Down**: 5, 8, 8, 1\n- **Move Left**: 4, 9, 8, 5\n- **Move Up**: 7, 4\n- **Move Right**: 9, 1, 0\n- **Move Down**: 8, 9\n- **Move Left**: 5, 1\n- **Move Up**: 1\n- **Move Right**: 1\n\nThe spiral order of the matrix is: 1, 9, 5, 3, 2, 5, 8, 8, 1, 4, 9, 8, 5, 7, 4, 9, 1, 0, 8, 9, 5, 1, 1\n\nTherefore, the final output is:\n<<<1 9 5 3 2 5 8 8 1 4 9 8 5 7 4 9 1 0 8 9 5 1 1>>>"
