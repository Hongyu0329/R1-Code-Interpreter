    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is 7 rows by 7 columns.\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - Start with four boundaries: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.\n   - Initially, `top = 0`, `bottom = 6` (last row index), `left = 0`, and `right = 6` (last column index).\n\n3. **Traverse the Matrix in Spiral Order**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row. After traversing, increment the `top` boundary.\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column. After traversing, decrement the `right` boundary.\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row, if `top` <= `bottom`. After traversing, decrement the `bottom` boundary.\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column, if `left` <= `right`. After traversing, increment the `left` boundary.\n   - Repeat the above steps until the `top` boundary exceeds the `bottom` boundary or the `left` boundary exceeds the `right` boundary.\n\n4. **Collect the Elements**:\n   - As you traverse, collect the elements in the order they are visited.\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - Once all elements are collected, format them as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- **Initial Matrix**:\n  ```\n  8 7 9 9 8 5 6\n  2 9 4 9 8 5 4\n  2 1 4 5 5 6 9\n  2 6 0 1 3 9 5\n  6 4 5 0 7 2 4\n  6 1 8 9 7 2 8\n  1 8 4 2 9 6 9\n  ```\n\n- **Spiral Order Traversal**:\n  1. Move Right: `8 7 9 9 8 5 6`\n  2. Move Down: `4 9 5 9 5 9`\n  3. Move Left: `6 2 9 4 8 1`\n  4. Move Up: `6 6 2 2`\n  5. Move Right: `1 4 5 5 6`\n  6. Move Down: `9 3 7`\n  7. Move Left: `2 7 0`\n  8. Move Up: `5 4`\n  9. Move Right: `0 1`\n  10. Move Down: `8 9`\n  11. Move Left: `8`\n\n- **Final Spiral Order**:\n  - The elements in spiral order are: `8 7 9 9 8 5 6 4 9 5 9 5 9 6 2 9 4 8 1 6 6 2 2 1 4 5 5 6 9 3 7 2 7 0 5 4 0 1 8 9 8`\n\n- **Formatted Output**:\n  - <<<8 7 9 9 8 5 6 4 9 5 9 5 9 6 2 9 4 8 1 6 6 2 2 1 4 5 5 6 9 3 7 2 7 0 5 4 0 1 8 9 8>>>\n\nTherefore, the list of elements in spiral order is:\n<<<8 7 9 9 8 5 6 4 9 5 9 5 9 6 2 9 4 8 1 6 6 2 2 1 4 5 5 6 9 3 7 2 7 0 5 4 0 1 8 9 8>>>"
