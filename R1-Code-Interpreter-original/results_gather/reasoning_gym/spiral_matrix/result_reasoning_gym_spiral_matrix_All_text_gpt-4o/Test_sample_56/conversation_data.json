    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to carefully follow the spiral traversal rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Initialization**: \n   - Start at the top-left corner of the matrix.\n   - Define boundaries for the traversal: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.\n   - Initially, `top = 0`, `bottom = number of rows - 1`, `left = 0`, `right = number of columns - 1`.\n\n2. **Spiral Traversal**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row. After traversing, increment `top` to move to the next row.\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column. After traversing, decrement `right` to move to the previous column.\n   - **Move Left**: If `top` is still less than or equal to `bottom`, traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row. After traversing, decrement `bottom` to move to the previous row.\n   - **Move Up**: If `left` is still less than or equal to `right`, traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column. After traversing, increment `left` to move to the next column.\n   - Repeat the above steps until all elements are visited.\n\n3. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure that after each move, the boundaries are checked to prevent re-traversing already visited elements.\n   - Handle cases where the matrix might be a single row or column.\n\n4. **Output**:\n   - Collect the elements in the order they are visited and format them as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n```\n7 0 8 5 2 7 0 9\n2 3 6 0 0 5 2 3\n7 5 3 2 5 8 7 5\n6 8 3 2 2 2 6 3\n6 1 5 8 4 7 7 2\n6 6 2 2 3 1 6 8\n7 1 4 4 1 0 8 8\n6 2 0 7 2 3 1 0\n```\n\n- **Move Right**: 7, 0, 8, 5, 2, 7, 0, 9\n- **Move Down**: 3, 5, 3, 2, 3, 8, 0\n- **Move Left**: 1, 3, 2, 7, 0, 2\n- **Move Up**: 6, 7, 6, 6, 7\n- **Move Right**: 2, 3, 6, 0, 0, 5\n- **Move Down**: 8, 7, 7, 6\n- **Move Left**: 1, 4, 4, 1\n- **Move Up**: 1, 6, 6\n- **Move Right**: 5, 3, 2, 5, 8\n- **Move Down**: 2, 2\n- **Move Left**: 2, 3, 8\n- **Move Up**: 5, 8\n- **Move Right**: 3, 2\n- **Move Down**: 5\n\nThe final spiral order list is:\n<<<7 0 8 5 2 7 0 9 3 5 3 2 3 8 0 1 3 2 7 0 2 6 7 6 6 7 2 3 6 0 0 5 8 7 7 6 1 4 4 1 1 6 6 5 3 2 5 8 2 2 2 3 8 5 8 3 2 5>>>"
