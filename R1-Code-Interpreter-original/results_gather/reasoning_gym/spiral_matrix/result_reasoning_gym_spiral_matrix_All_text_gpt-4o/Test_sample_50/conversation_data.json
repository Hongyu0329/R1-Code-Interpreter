    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to carefully follow the steps outlined for traversing the matrix in a spiral manner. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 4x4 matrix:\n     ```\n     3 2 2 4\n     2 7 6 7\n     4 8 1 4\n     9 8 0 2\n     ```\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - We need to keep track of the boundaries of the matrix as we traverse it:\n     - `top` starts at 0\n     - `bottom` starts at 3 (last row index)\n     - `left` starts at 0\n     - `right` starts at 3 (last column index)\n\n3. **Traverse the Matrix in Spiral Order**:\n   - **Move Right**: Start from the top-left corner and move right across the top row.\n     - Elements: 3, 2, 2, 4\n     - Update `top` to 1 (move the top boundary down)\n   \n   - **Move Down**: Move down the rightmost column.\n     - Elements: 7, 4, 2\n     - Update `right` to 2 (move the right boundary left)\n   \n   - **Move Left**: Move left across the bottom row.\n     - Elements: 0, 8, 9\n     - Update `bottom` to 2 (move the bottom boundary up)\n   \n   - **Move Up**: Move up the leftmost column.\n     - Elements: 4, 2\n     - Update `left` to 1 (move the left boundary right)\n\n4. **Repeat for Inner Matrix**:\n   - **Move Right**: Move right across the new top row.\n     - Elements: 7, 6\n     - Update `top` to 2\n   \n   - **Move Down**: Move down the new rightmost column.\n     - Element: 1\n     - Update `right` to 1\n   \n   - **Move Left**: Move left across the new bottom row.\n     - Element: 8\n     - Update `bottom` to 1\n\n5. **Final Element**:\n   - The only remaining element is in the center of the matrix.\n     - Element: 7\n\n6. **Compile the Result**:\n   - Combine all the elements collected in the order they were visited: 3, 2, 2, 4, 7, 4, 2, 0, 8, 9, 4, 2, 7, 6, 1, 8, 7\n\n7. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final output should be a space-separated list of these elements enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<3 2 2 4 7 4 2 0 8 9 4 2 7 6 1 8 7>>>"
