    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Structure**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     8 0\n     4 7\n     ```\n   - This is a 2x2 matrix with 2 rows and 2 columns.\n\n2. **Spiral Order Traversal**:\n   - Start from the top-left corner of the matrix.\n   - Move right across the top row.\n   - Move down the last column.\n   - Move left across the bottom row.\n   - Move up the first column if there are any unvisited elements.\n   - Repeat the process for any inner sub-matrix.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Traversal**:\n   - **Step 1**: Start at the top-left corner (element `8`).\n   - **Step 2**: Move right across the top row. The elements are `8` and `0`.\n   - **Step 3**: Move down the last column. The next element is `7`.\n   - **Step 4**: Move left across the bottom row. The next element is `4`.\n   - **Step 5**: There are no more unvisited elements to move up, so the traversal is complete.\n\n4. **Compile the Result**:\n   - The elements visited in spiral order are: `8`, `0`, `7`, `4`.\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final output should be a space-separated list of these elements enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the spiral order of the given matrix.\n\n**Final Answer**: <<<8 0 7 4>>>"
