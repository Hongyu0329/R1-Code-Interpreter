    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Layout:**\n   The given matrix is:\n   ```\n   3 1 3\n   2 4 9\n   1 0 8\n   ```\n   This is a 3x3 matrix.\n\n2. **Spiral Order Traversal:**\n   We need to traverse the matrix in a spiral order, starting from the top-left corner and moving clockwise.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Traversal:**\n   - **Step 1:** Start at the top-left corner and move right across the first row.\n     - Elements: 3, 1, 3\n   - **Step 2:** Move down the last column.\n     - Elements: 9, 8\n   - **Step 3:** Move left across the bottom row.\n     - Elements: 0, 1\n   - **Step 4:** Move up the first column.\n     - Element: 2\n   - **Step 5:** Move right across the remaining middle row.\n     - Element: 4\n\n4. **Combine the Elements:**\n   Combine all the elements collected in the order they were traversed:\n   - 3, 1, 3, 9, 8, 0, 1, 2, 4\n\n5. **Format the Output:**\n   The final output should be a space-separated list of these elements enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that every element of the matrix is visited exactly once in the correct spiral order.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n<<<3 1 3 9 8 0 1 2 4>>>"
