    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to carefully follow the spiral traversal rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 9x9 matrix.\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - Start with four boundaries: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.\n   - Initially, `top = 0`, `bottom = 8`, `left = 0`, and `right = 8`.\n\n3. **Spiral Traversal**:\n   - We will traverse the matrix in a spiral order by adjusting the boundaries after each complete traversal of a row or column.\n\n4. **Traverse from Left to Right**:\n   - Start from the `top` row and move from `left` to `right`.\n   - After traversing, increment the `top` boundary by 1.\n\n5. **Traverse from Top to Bottom**:\n   - Move downwards along the `right` column from the new `top` to `bottom`.\n   - After traversing, decrement the `right` boundary by 1.\n\n6. **Traverse from Right to Left**:\n   - If `top` is still less than or equal to `bottom`, move from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row.\n   - After traversing, decrement the `bottom` boundary by 1.\n\n7. **Traverse from Bottom to Top**:\n   - If `left` is still less than or equal to `right`, move upwards along the `left` column from the new `bottom` to `top`.\n   - After traversing, increment the `left` boundary by 1.\n\n8. **Repeat**:\n   - Repeat steps 4 to 7 until all elements are visited, i.e., until `top` exceeds `bottom` or `left` exceeds `right`.\n\n9. **Output the Result**:\n   - Collect all the elements in the order they are visited and format them as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start at the top-left corner and move right: `6 7 3 9 3 7 3 4 6`\n- Move down the right column: `7 6 6 4 8 9 1 6 9`\n- Move left along the bottom row: `4 2 6 8 7 8 0`\n- Move up the left column: `7 0 1 8 5 3 3`\n- Continue the spiral inward following the same pattern.\n\nFollowing these steps, the spiral order of the matrix is:\n\n<<<6 7 3 9 3 7 3 4 6 7 6 6 4 8 9 1 6 9 4 2 6 8 7 8 0 7 0 1 8 5 3 3 2 1 5 6 5 6 4 1 9 1 0 8 2 8 9 7 2 7 8 8 7 2 6 0 5 0 1 9 6 4 2 6 5 5 6 6 8 8 0 9 9 1 4 8 9 8 0 3 2 2 1 0 5 5 6 5 6 4 0 7 0 8 7 8 6 2 4 9>>>"
