    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to carefully follow the steps outlined for traversing the matrix in a spiral manner. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 4x4 matrix:\n     ```\n     6 7 3 4\n     7 0 7 8\n     3 7 3 6\n     5 8 9 7\n     ```\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - Start with the following boundaries:\n     - `top` = 0 (initial row index)\n     - `bottom` = 3 (last row index)\n     - `left` = 0 (initial column index)\n     - `right` = 3 (last column index)\n\n3. **Traverse the Matrix in Spiral Order**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row.\n     - Elements: 6, 7, 3, 4\n     - Update `top` to 1 (move down to the next row).\n\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column.\n     - Elements: 8, 6, 7\n     - Update `right` to 2 (move left to the previous column).\n\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row.\n     - Elements: 9, 8, 5\n     - Update `bottom` to 2 (move up to the previous row).\n\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column.\n     - Elements: 3, 7\n     - Update `left` to 1 (move right to the next column).\n\n4. **Repeat for Inner Matrix**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row.\n     - Elements: 0, 7\n     - Update `top` to 2.\n\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column.\n     - Element: 3\n     - Update `right` to 1.\n\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row.\n     - Element: 7\n     - Update `bottom` to 1.\n\n5. **Final Element**:\n   - The only remaining element is at the position (1, 1), which is 7.\n\n6. **Compile the Result**:\n   - Combine all the elements collected in spiral order: 6, 7, 3, 4, 8, 6, 7, 9, 8, 5, 3, 7, 0, 7, 3, 7\n\n7. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final output should be a space-separated list of integers enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<6 7 3 4 8 6 7 9 8 5 3 7 0 7 3 7>>>"
