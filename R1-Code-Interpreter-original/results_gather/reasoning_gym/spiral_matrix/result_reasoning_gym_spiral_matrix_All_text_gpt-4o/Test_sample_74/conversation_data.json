    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 9x9 matrix, meaning it has 9 rows and 9 columns.\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - We need to keep track of the boundaries of the matrix as we traverse it in a spiral order. \n   - Initialize `top` to 0, `bottom` to 8 (last row index), `left` to 0, and `right` to 8 (last column index).\n\n3. **Traverse the Matrix in Spiral Order**:\n   - **Move Right**: Start from the top-left corner and move right across the topmost row from the `left` boundary to the `right` boundary. After traversing, increment the `top` boundary by 1.\n   - **Move Down**: Move down the rightmost column from the `top` boundary to the `bottom` boundary. After traversing, decrement the `right` boundary by 1.\n   - **Move Left**: If the `top` boundary is still less than or equal to the `bottom` boundary, move left across the bottommost row from the `right` boundary to the `left` boundary. After traversing, decrement the `bottom` boundary by 1.\n   - **Move Up**: If the `left` boundary is still less than or equal to the `right` boundary, move up the leftmost column from the `bottom` boundary to the `top` boundary. After traversing, increment the `left` boundary by 1.\n   - Repeat the above steps until all elements are visited.\n\n4. **Collect the Elements**:\n   - As we traverse the matrix in spiral order, collect the elements in a list.\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - Convert the list of elements into a space-separated string and enclose it within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start at the top-left corner and move right: 6, 5, 4, 4, 1, 2, 2, 9, 3\n- Move down the rightmost column: 1, 7, 4, 8, 2, 9, 7, 2\n- Move left across the bottom row: 4, 6, 9, 8, 8, 2, 8, 7\n- Move up the leftmost column: 7, 2, 3, 6, 3, 8, 3\n- Move right across the second row from the top: 5, 5, 4, 5, 2, 8, 7\n- Move down the second column from the right: 0, 5, 6, 0, 1, 3\n- Move left across the second row from the bottom: 3, 4, 7, 2, 2, 7\n- Move up the second column from the left: 5, 7, 6, 4\n- Move right across the third row from the top: 5, 5, 7, 8, 0\n- Move down the third column from the right: 5, 6, 1\n- Move left across the third row from the bottom: 3, 3, 1\n- Move up the third column from the left: 4, 3\n- Move right across the fourth row from the top: 5, 3, 5\n- Move down the fourth column from the right: 8\n- Move left across the fourth row from the bottom: 2, 2\n- Move up the fourth column from the left: 0\n- Finally, move right across the center: 2\n\nThe final spiral order of elements is:\n<<<6 5 4 4 1 2 2 9 3 1 7 4 8 2 9 7 2 4 6 9 8 8 2 8 7 2 3 6 3 8 3 5 5 4 5 2 8 7 0 5 6 0 1 3 3 4 7 2 2 7 5 7 6 4 5 5 7 8 0 5 6 1 3 3 1 4 3 5 3 5 8 2 2 0 2>>>\n"
