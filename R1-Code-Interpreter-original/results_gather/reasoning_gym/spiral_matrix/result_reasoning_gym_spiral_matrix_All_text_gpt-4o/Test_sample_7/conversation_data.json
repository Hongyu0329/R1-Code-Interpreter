    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 5x5 matrix:\n     ```\n     3 1 0 6 1\n     9 6 6 9 0\n     0 4 5 3 6\n     6 4 2 5 4\n     1 5 0 8 4\n     ```\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - Start with four boundaries: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.\n   - Initially, `top = 0`, `bottom = 4`, `left = 0`, `right = 4`.\n\n3. **Traverse the Matrix in Spiral Order**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row. After traversing, increment `top` by 1.\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column. After traversing, decrement `right` by 1.\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row, if `top` <= `bottom`. After traversing, decrement `bottom` by 1.\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column, if `left` <= `right`. After traversing, increment `left` by 1.\n   - Repeat the above steps until all elements are visited.\n\n4. **Collect Elements**:\n   - As we traverse, collect the elements in the order they are visited.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Format the collected elements as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- **Move Right** along the top row: `3 1 0 6 1`\n- **Move Down** along the right column: `0 6 4`\n- **Move Left** along the bottom row: `8 0 5 1`\n- **Move Up** along the left column: `6 0 9`\n- **Move Right** along the second row from the top: `6 6 9`\n- **Move Down** along the second column from the right: `3 5`\n- **Move Left** along the second row from the bottom: `2 4`\n- **Move Up** along the second column from the left: `4`\n- **Move Right** along the third row from the top: `5`\n\nThe collected elements in spiral order are: `3 1 0 6 1 0 6 4 8 0 5 1 6 0 9 6 6 9 3 5 2 4 4 5`\n\nThe final output is:\n<<<3 1 0 6 1 0 6 4 8 0 5 1 6 0 9 6 6 9 3 5 2 4 4 5>>>"
