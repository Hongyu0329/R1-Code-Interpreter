    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Layout:**\n   The given matrix is:\n   ```\n   5 9 4\n   2 9 2\n   9 8 5\n   ```\n   This is a 3x3 matrix.\n\n2. **Spiral Order Traversal:**\n   We need to traverse the matrix in a spiral order, starting from the top-left corner. The steps are as follows:\n   - Start at the top-left corner and move right across the top row.\n   - Move down the last column.\n   - Move left across the bottom row.\n   - Move up the first column.\n   - Continue this pattern for any remaining inner layers of the matrix.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Traversal:**\n   - **Top Row:** Start from the top-left corner and move right across the first row: `5, 9, 4`.\n   - **Right Column:** Move down the last column: `2, 5`.\n   - **Bottom Row:** Move left across the bottom row (only if there are unvisited elements): `8, 9`.\n   - **Left Column:** Move up the first column (only if there are unvisited elements): `2`.\n   - **Inner Layer:** Now, we are left with the center element: `9`.\n\n4. **Combine the Elements:**\n   Combine all the elements in the order they were visited: `5, 9, 4, 2, 5, 8, 9, 2, 9`.\n\n5. **Format the Output:**\n   The final output should be a space-separated list of integers enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the spiral order of the matrix.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n<<<5 9 4 2 5 8 9 2 9>>>"
