    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Structure**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     3 5\n     6 3\n     ```\n   - This is a 2x2 matrix with 2 rows and 2 columns.\n\n2. **Spiral Order Traversal**:\n   - Start from the top-left corner of the matrix.\n   - Move right across the top row.\n   - Move down the last column.\n   - Move left across the bottom row.\n   - Move up the first column.\n   - Continue this pattern until all elements are visited.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Traversal**:\n   - **Start at (0,0)**: The element is `3`.\n   - **Move right** to (0,1): The element is `5`.\n   - **Move down** to (1,1): The element is `3`.\n   - **Move left** to (1,0): The element is `6`.\n\n4. **Collect the Elements**:\n   - As we traverse, we collect the elements in the order we visit them: `3`, `5`, `3`, `6`.\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - The elements should be output as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the spiral order of the matrix.\n\n**Final Answer**: <<<3 5 3 6>>>"
