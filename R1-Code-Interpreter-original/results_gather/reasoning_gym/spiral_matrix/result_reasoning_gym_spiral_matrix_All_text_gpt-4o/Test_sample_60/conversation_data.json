    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to carefully follow the spiral traversal pattern. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: The given matrix is 8 rows by 8 columns.\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**: \n   - `top` starts at 0 (the first row).\n   - `bottom` starts at 7 (the last row).\n   - `left` starts at 0 (the first column).\n   - `right` starts at 7 (the last column).\n\n3. **Spiral Traversal**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row. After traversing, increment `top` by 1 to move to the next row.\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column. After traversing, decrement `right` by 1 to move to the previous column.\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row. After traversing, decrement `bottom` by 1 to move to the previous row.\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column. After traversing, increment `left` by 1 to move to the next column.\n\n4. **Repeat**: Continue the above steps until `top` exceeds `bottom` or `left` exceeds `right`.\n\n5. **Collect Elements**: As we traverse, collect the elements in the order they are visited.\n\n6. **Output Format**: The final list of elements should be output as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start at the top-left corner and move right: `7 4 8 2 1 4 0 2`\n- Move down the right column: `7 7 9 0 1 8 2`\n- Move left along the bottom row: `9 9 9 8 4 6 0`\n- Move up the left column: `4 6 1 9 5 8`\n- Move right on the second row from the top: `1 2 7 2 6 1`\n- Move down the second column from the right: `3 9 9 5`\n- Move left on the second row from the bottom: `5 7 6 9 4`\n- Move up the second column from the left: `9 2 1`\n- Move right on the third row from the top: `7 2 6`\n- Move down the third column from the right: `8 9`\n- Move left on the third row from the bottom: `5 0 5`\n- Move up the third column from the left: `3 0`\n- Move right on the fourth row from the top: `2 2`\n- Move down the fourth column from the right: `9`\n- Move left on the fourth row from the bottom: `6 9`\n- Finally, move up the fourth column from the left: `4`\n\nThe complete spiral order traversal of the matrix is:\n\n<<<7 4 8 2 1 4 0 2 7 7 9 0 1 8 2 9 9 9 8 4 6 0 4 6 1 9 5 8 1 2 7 2 6 1 3 9 9 5 5 7 6 9 4 9 2 1 7 2 6 8 9 5 0 5 3 0 2 2 9 6 9 4>>>"
