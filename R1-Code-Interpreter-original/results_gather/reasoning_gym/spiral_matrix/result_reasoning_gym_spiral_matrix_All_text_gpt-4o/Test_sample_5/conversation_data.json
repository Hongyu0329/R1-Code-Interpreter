    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Layout**: \n   The given matrix is:\n   ```\n   9 0 9\n   8 7 5\n   8 1 7\n   ```\n   It is a 3x3 matrix.\n\n2. **Define the Spiral Order Movement**:\n   - Start from the top-left corner and move right across the top row.\n   - Move down the last column.\n   - Move left across the bottom row.\n   - Move up the first column.\n   - Continue this pattern for the inner layers of the matrix.\n\n3. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - `top` starts at 0 (first row).\n   - `bottom` starts at 2 (last row).\n   - `left` starts at 0 (first column).\n   - `right` starts at 2 (last column).\n\n4. **Traverse the Matrix in Spiral Order**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row. Increment `top` after traversing.\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column. Decrement `right` after traversing.\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row. Decrement `bottom` after traversing.\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column. Increment `left` after traversing.\n\n5. **Repeat Until All Elements are Visited**:\n   - Continue the above steps while `top <= bottom` and `left <= right`.\n\n6. **Collect the Elements**:\n   - As we traverse, collect the elements in the order they are visited.\n\n7. **Output the Result**:\n   - Format the collected elements as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- **Move Right** across the top row: 9, 0, 9\n- **Move Down** the last column: 5, 7\n- **Move Left** across the bottom row: 1, 8\n- **Move Up** the first column: 8\n- **Move Right** across the remaining middle row: 7\n\nThe elements in spiral order are: 9, 0, 9, 5, 7, 1, 8, 8, 7\n\nTherefore, the final output is:\n<<<9 0 9 5 7 1 8 8 7>>>"
