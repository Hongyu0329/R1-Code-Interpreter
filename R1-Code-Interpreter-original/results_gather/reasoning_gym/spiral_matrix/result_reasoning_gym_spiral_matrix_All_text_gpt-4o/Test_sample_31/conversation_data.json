    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 9x9 matrix, meaning it has 9 rows and 9 columns.\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - We need to keep track of the boundaries of the matrix as we traverse it in a spiral order. \n   - Initialize `top` to 0, `bottom` to 8 (last row index), `left` to 0, and `right` to 8 (last column index).\n\n3. **Traverse the Matrix in Spiral Order**:\n   - **Move Right**: Start from the top-left corner and move right across the topmost row from the `left` boundary to the `right` boundary. After traversing, increment the `top` boundary by 1.\n   - **Move Down**: Move down the rightmost column from the `top` boundary to the `bottom` boundary. After traversing, decrement the `right` boundary by 1.\n   - **Move Left**: If the `top` boundary is still less than or equal to the `bottom` boundary, move left across the bottommost row from the `right` boundary to the `left` boundary. After traversing, decrement the `bottom` boundary by 1.\n   - **Move Up**: If the `left` boundary is still less than or equal to the `right` boundary, move up the leftmost column from the `bottom` boundary to the `top` boundary. After traversing, increment the `left` boundary by 1.\n   - Repeat the above steps until all elements are visited.\n\n4. **Collect the Elements**:\n   - As we traverse the matrix in the above order, collect the elements in a list.\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - Once all elements are collected in spiral order, format the output as a space-separated list of integers enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start at the top-left corner and move right: `3 6 3 2 3 0 4 0 7`\n- Move down the rightmost column: `9 3 6 5 6 5 2 1`\n- Move left across the bottom row: `7 7 1 0 9 0 5 0`\n- Move up the leftmost column: `6 2 1 1 2 1 5`\n- Move right across the second row from the top: `4 0 8 1 4 4 9`\n- Move down the second column from the right: `3 8 9 3 8 4`\n- Move left across the second row from the bottom: `5 4 7 0 2 9`\n- Move up the second column from the left: `9 6 1 5`\n- Move right across the third row from the top: `8 6 6 2 5`\n- Move down the third column from the right: `9 8 7`\n- Move left across the third row from the bottom: `7 0 0`\n- Move up the third column from the left: `9 2`\n- Move right across the fourth row from the top: `5 9 8`\n- Move down the fourth column from the right: `7`\n- Move left across the fourth row from the bottom: `1 0`\n- Move up the fourth column from the left: `5`\n- Finally, move right across the center: `4`\n\nThe final spiral order list is:\n`3 6 3 2 3 0 4 0 7 9 3 6 5 6 5 2 1 7 7 1 0 9 0 5 0 6 2 1 1 2 1 5 4 0 8 1 4 4 9 3 8 9 3 8 4 5 4 7 0 2 9 9 6 1 5 8 6 6 2 5 9 8 7 7 0 0 9 2 5 9 8 7 1 0 5 4`\n\nTherefore, the output is:\n<<<3 6 3 2 3 0 4 0 7 9 3 6 5 6 5 2 1 7 7 1 0 9 0 5 0 6 2 1 1 2 1 5 4 0 8 1 4 4 9 3 8 9 3 8 4 5 4 7 0 2 9 9 6 1 5 8 6 6 2 5 9 8 7 7 0 0 9 2 5 9 8 7 1 0 5 4>>>"
