    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: The given matrix is a 10x10 matrix. This means there are 10 rows and 10 columns.\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**: \n   - `top` boundary starts at 0.\n   - `bottom` boundary starts at 9 (last row index).\n   - `left` boundary starts at 0.\n   - `right` boundary starts at 9 (last column index).\n\n3. **Spiral Traversal**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from the `left` to the `right` boundary along the `top` row. After traversing, increment the `top` boundary by 1.\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from the `top` to the `bottom` boundary along the `right` column. After traversing, decrement the `right` boundary by 1.\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from the `right` to the `left` boundary along the `bottom` row, if `top` <= `bottom`. After traversing, decrement the `bottom` boundary by 1.\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from the `bottom` to the `top` boundary along the `left` column, if `left` <= `right`. After traversing, increment the `left` boundary by 1.\n   - Repeat the above steps until the `top` boundary exceeds the `bottom` boundary or the `left` boundary exceeds the `right` boundary.\n\n4. **Collect Elements**: As we traverse, we collect the elements in the order we visit them.\n\n5. **Output Format**: The collected elements should be output as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start at the top-left corner and move right: `0 2 7 2 8 5 1 9 4 6`\n- Move down the right column: `4 9 0 6 1 7 6 7 4 5`\n- Move left along the bottom row: `8 8 5 2 5 2 9 6 2`\n- Move up the left column: `9 9 4 1 8 7 4 1`\n- Move right along the second row: `9 5 5 0 1 7 1 3`\n- Move down the second-to-last column: `5 3 2 9 6 6 7 8`\n- Move left along the second-to-last row: `7 0 2 2 7 0 9 9`\n- Move up the second column: `6 6 5 8 5 6 3`\n- Move right along the third row: `4 4 2 6 3 3`\n- Move down the third-to-last column: `2 8 8 2 1`\n- Move left along the third-to-last row: `1 1 1 9 9 7`\n- Move up the third column: `1 2 9`\n- Move right along the fourth row: `3 4 6 2 4`\n- Move down the fourth-to-last column: `3 8 3`\n- Move left along the fourth-to-last row: `2 3 0 3`\n- Move up the fourth column: `2 8`\n- Move right along the fifth row: `2 3`\n- Move down the fifth-to-last column: `8`\n\nThe final spiral order list is:\n`0 2 7 2 8 5 1 9 4 6 4 9 0 6 1 7 6 7 4 5 8 8 5 2 5 2 9 6 2 9 9 4 1 8 7 4 1 9 5 5 0 1 7 1 3 5 3 2 9 6 6 7 8 7 0 2 2 7 0 9 9 6 6 5 8 5 6 3 4 4 2 6 3 3 2 8 8 2 1 1 1 1 9 9 7 1 2 9 3 4 6 2 4 3 8 3 2 3 0 3 2 8 2 3 8`\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<0 2 7 2 8 5 1 9 4 6 4 9 0 6 1 7 6 7 4 5 8 8 5 2 5 2 9 6 2 9 9 4 1 8 7 4 1 9 5 5 0 1 7 1 3 5 3 2 9 6 6 7 8 7 0 2 2 7 0 9 9 6 6 5 8 5 6 3 4 4 2 6 3 3 2 8 8 2 1 1 1 1 9 9 7 1 2 9 3 4 6 2 4 3 8 3 2 3 0 3 2 8 2 3 8>>>"
