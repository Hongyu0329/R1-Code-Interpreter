    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 5x5 matrix:\n     ```\n     5 8 0 4 6\n     5 2 7 5 7\n     2 8 1 1 5\n     6 2 8 4 1\n     8 4 7 0 9\n     ```\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - Start with four boundaries: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.\n   - Initially, `top = 0`, `bottom = 4`, `left = 0`, `right = 4`.\n\n3. **Traverse the Matrix in Spiral Order**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row, then increment `top`.\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column, then decrement `right`.\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row, then decrement `bottom`.\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column, then increment `left`.\n   - Repeat the above steps until `top` exceeds `bottom` or `left` exceeds `right`.\n\n4. **Collect the Elements**:\n   - As we traverse, collect the elements in the order they are visited.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Format the collected elements as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- **Move Right** along the top row: `5 8 0 4 6`\n- **Move Down** along the right column: `7 5 1 9`\n- **Move Left** along the bottom row: `0 7 4 8`\n- **Move Up** along the left column: `6 2`\n- **Move Right** along the second row from the top: `2 7 5`\n- **Move Down** along the second column from the right: `1 4`\n- **Move Left** along the second row from the bottom: `8 2`\n- **Move Up** along the second column from the left: `8`\n- **Move Right** along the third row from the top: `1`\n\nThe spiral order of the matrix is: `5 8 0 4 6 7 5 1 9 0 7 4 8 6 2 2 7 5 1 4 8 2 8 1`\n\nTherefore, the final output is:\n\n<<<5 8 0 4 6 7 5 1 9 0 7 4 8 6 2 2 7 5 1 4 8 2 8 1>>>"
