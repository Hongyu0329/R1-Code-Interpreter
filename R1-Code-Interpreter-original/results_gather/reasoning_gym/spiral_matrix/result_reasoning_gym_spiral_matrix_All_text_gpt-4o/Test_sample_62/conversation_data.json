    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to carefully follow the spiral traversal rules. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 10x10 matrix.\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - Start with four boundaries: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.\n   - Initially, `top = 0`, `bottom = 9`, `left = 0`, `right = 9`.\n\n3. **Spiral Traversal**:\n   - We will traverse the matrix in a spiral order by adjusting the boundaries after each complete traversal of a side.\n   - The traversal order is: right, down, left, and up.\n\n4. **Traverse Right**:\n   - Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` boundary.\n   - After traversing, increment the `top` boundary by 1.\n\n5. **Traverse Down**:\n   - Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` boundary.\n   - After traversing, decrement the `right` boundary by 1.\n\n6. **Traverse Left**:\n   - Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` boundary.\n   - After traversing, decrement the `bottom` boundary by 1.\n\n7. **Traverse Up**:\n   - Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` boundary.\n   - After traversing, increment the `left` boundary by 1.\n\n8. **Repeat**:\n   - Repeat the above steps until the `top` boundary exceeds the `bottom` boundary or the `left` boundary exceeds the `right` boundary.\n\n9. **Collect Elements**:\n   - Collect the elements in the order they are traversed and store them in a list.\n\n10. **Output the Result**:\n    - Format the list of elements as a space-separated string enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start at the top-left corner and move right: `3 5 0 6 3 9 0 8 8 6`\n- Move down the right side: `2 0 2 5 4 5 2 0`\n- Move left along the bottom: `3 2 6 6 1 3 2 5 4 5`\n- Move up the left side: `1 9 7 5 4 4 0 0`\n- Continue the spiral inward, repeating the process until all elements are visited.\n\nFollowing these steps, the spiral order of the matrix is:\n\n<<<3 5 0 6 3 9 0 8 8 6 2 0 2 5 4 5 2 0 3 2 6 6 1 3 2 5 4 5 1 9 7 5 4 4 0 0 0 6 4 6 2 7 3 7 5 0 8 9 4 9 4 8 0 5 2 9 6 0 5 2 8 4 7 7 4 3 0 9 7 3 9 2 5 2 8 7 3 6 7 6 3 9 1 4 1 4 8 2 0 8 9 4 7 3 9 2 5 8 0 7>>>\n"
