    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 10x10 matrix.\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - We need to keep track of the boundaries of the matrix as we traverse it in a spiral order.\n   - Initialize `top` to 0, `bottom` to 9 (last row index), `left` to 0, and `right` to 9 (last column index).\n\n3. **Traverse the Matrix in Spiral Order**:\n   - **Move Right**: Start from the top-left corner and move right across the topmost row from the `left` boundary to the `right` boundary. After traversing, increment the `top` boundary by 1.\n   - **Move Down**: Move down the rightmost column from the `top` boundary to the `bottom` boundary. After traversing, decrement the `right` boundary by 1.\n   - **Move Left**: If the `top` boundary is still less than or equal to the `bottom` boundary, move left across the bottommost row from the `right` boundary to the `left` boundary. After traversing, decrement the `bottom` boundary by 1.\n   - **Move Up**: If the `left` boundary is still less than or equal to the `right` boundary, move up the leftmost column from the `bottom` boundary to the `top` boundary. After traversing, increment the `left` boundary by 1.\n   - Repeat the above steps until all elements are visited.\n\n4. **Collect the Elements**:\n   - As we traverse the matrix, collect the elements in the order they are visited.\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - Once all elements are collected, format them as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start at the top-left corner and move right: 4, 3, 2, 9, 3, 0, 4, 7, 3, 8\n- Move down the rightmost column: 9, 9, 9, 4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 8\n- Move left across the bottom row: 4, 9, 4, 5, 7, 2, 8, 6, 8\n- Move up the leftmost column: 2, 1, 3, 9, 0, 3, 4, 8\n- Move right across the second row: 7, 5, 5, 1, 5, 1, 4, 6\n- Move down the second-to-last column: 2, 2, 1, 2, 5, 9, 3\n- Move left across the second-to-last row: 7, 5, 6, 5, 7, 2, 8\n- Move up the second column: 7, 7, 2, 1, 2, 7\n- Move right across the third row: 6, 7, 2, 4, 2\n- Move down the third-to-last column: 2, 6, 9\n- Move left across the third-to-last row: 9, 9, 2, 4\n- Move up the third column: 1, 0, 6\n- Move right across the fourth row: 3, 1, 2\n- Move down the fourth-to-last column: 7\n- Move left across the fourth-to-last row: 5, 2\n- Move up the fourth column: 0\n\nThe final spiral order of elements is:\n\n<<<4 3 2 9 3 0 4 7 3 8 9 9 9 4 2 0 0 0 3 8 4 9 4 5 7 2 8 6 8 2 1 3 9 0 3 4 8 7 5 5 1 5 1 4 6 2 2 1 2 5 9 3 7 5 6 5 7 2 8 7 7 2 1 2 7 6 7 2 4 2 2 6 9 9 9 2 4 1 0 6 3 1 2 7 5 2 0>>>"
