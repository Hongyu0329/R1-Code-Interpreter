    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 6x6 matrix, which means it has 6 rows and 6 columns.\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - We need to keep track of the boundaries of the matrix as we traverse it in a spiral order.\n   - Initialize `top` to 0, `bottom` to 5 (last row index), `left` to 0, and `right` to 5 (last column index).\n\n3. **Traverse the Matrix in Spiral Order**:\n   - **Move Right**: Start from the top-left corner and move right across the top row. Increment the `top` boundary after traversing.\n   - **Move Down**: Move down the last column. Decrement the `right` boundary after traversing.\n   - **Move Left**: If there are remaining rows, move left across the bottom row. Decrement the `bottom` boundary after traversing.\n   - **Move Up**: If there are remaining columns, move up the first column. Increment the `left` boundary after traversing.\n   - Repeat the above steps until all elements are visited.\n\n4. **Collect Elements**:\n   - As we traverse, collect the elements in the order they are visited.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Format the collected elements as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\nMatrix:\n```\n2 9 6 2 5 7\n8 1 4 2 6 8\n7 0 3 3 7 0\n0 3 8 7 5 0\n7 8 0 0 8 8\n4 3 5 7 9 8\n```\n\n- **Move Right** across the top row: 2, 9, 6, 2, 5, 7\n- **Move Down** the last column: 8, 0, 0, 8, 8\n- **Move Left** across the bottom row: 9, 7, 5, 3, 4\n- **Move Up** the first column: 7, 0, 8\n- **Move Right** across the second row: 1, 4, 2, 6\n- **Move Down** the second last column: 7, 5\n- **Move Left** across the second last row: 7, 8, 3\n- **Move Up** the second column: 0\n- **Move Right** across the third row: 3, 3\n- **Move Down** the third last column: 8\n\nThe spiral order of elements is: 2, 9, 6, 2, 5, 7, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 9, 7, 5, 3, 4, 7, 0, 8, 1, 4, 2, 6, 7, 5, 7, 8, 3, 0, 3, 3, 8\n\nFinal output:\n<<<2 9 6 2 5 7 8 0 0 8 8 9 7 5 3 4 7 0 8 1 4 2 6 7 5 7 8 3 0 3 3 8>>>"
