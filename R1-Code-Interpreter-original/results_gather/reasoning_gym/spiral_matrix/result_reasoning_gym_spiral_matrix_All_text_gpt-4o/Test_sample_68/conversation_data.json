    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to carefully follow the steps outlined for traversing the matrix in a spiral manner. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 4x4 matrix:\n     ```\n     7 8 3 7\n     8 5 1 6\n     7 1 2 6\n     4 0 5 1\n     ```\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - Start with the following boundaries:\n     - `top` = 0 (initial top row)\n     - `bottom` = 3 (initial bottom row)\n     - `left` = 0 (initial left column)\n     - `right` = 3 (initial right column)\n\n3. **Traverse the Matrix in Spiral Order**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row.\n     - Elements: 7, 8, 3, 7\n     - Update `top` boundary: `top` = 1\n\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column.\n     - Elements: 6, 6, 1\n     - Update `right` boundary: `right` = 2\n\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row.\n     - Elements: 5, 0, 4\n     - Update `bottom` boundary: `bottom` = 2\n\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column.\n     - Elements: 7, 8\n     - Update `left` boundary: `left` = 1\n\n   - **Repeat the Process for Inner Matrix**:\n     - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row.\n       - Elements: 5, 1\n       - Update `top` boundary: `top` = 2\n\n     - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column.\n       - Elements: 2\n       - Update `right` boundary: `right` = 1\n\n     - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row.\n       - Elements: 1\n       - Update `bottom` boundary: `bottom` = 1\n\n4. **Compile the Result**:\n   - Combine all the elements collected in the order they were traversed.\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final list of elements in spiral order is: 7, 8, 3, 7, 6, 6, 1, 5, 0, 4, 7, 8, 5, 1, 2, 1\n   - Format the output as specified: <<<7 8 3 7 6 6 1 5 0 4 7 8 5 1 2 1>>>\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<7 8 3 7 6 6 1 5 0 4 7 8 5 1 2 1>>>"
