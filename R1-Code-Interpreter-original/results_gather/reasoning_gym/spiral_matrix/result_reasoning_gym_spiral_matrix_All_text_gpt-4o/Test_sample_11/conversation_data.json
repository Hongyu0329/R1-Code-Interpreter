    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Layout**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     5 7\n     2 4\n     ```\n   - This is a 2x2 matrix with 2 rows and 2 columns.\n\n2. **Spiral Order Traversal**:\n   - Start from the top-left corner of the matrix.\n   - Move right across the top row.\n   - Move down the last column.\n   - Move left across the bottom row.\n   - Move up the first column.\n   - Continue this pattern until all elements are visited.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Traversal**:\n   - **Step 1**: Start at the top-left corner (5).\n   - **Step 2**: Move right to the next element in the top row (7).\n   - **Step 3**: Move down to the next element in the last column (4).\n   - **Step 4**: Move left to the next element in the bottom row (2).\n\n4. **Compile the Spiral Order**:\n   - The order of elements visited in the spiral order is: 5, 7, 4, 2.\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - The elements should be output as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the spiral order of the given matrix.\n\n**Final Answer**: <<<5 7 4 2>>>"
