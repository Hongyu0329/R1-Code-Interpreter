    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to carefully follow the spiral traversal rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 9x9 matrix.\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - Start with four boundaries: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.\n   - Initially, `top = 0`, `bottom = 8`, `left = 0`, and `right = 8`.\n\n3. **Spiral Traversal**:\n   - We will traverse the matrix in a spiral order by adjusting the boundaries after each complete traversal of a side.\n\n4. **Traverse from Left to Right**:\n   - Start from the `top` boundary and move from `left` to `right`.\n   - After traversing, increment the `top` boundary by 1.\n\n5. **Traverse from Top to Bottom**:\n   - Move downwards along the `right` boundary from `top` to `bottom`.\n   - After traversing, decrement the `right` boundary by 1.\n\n6. **Traverse from Right to Left**:\n   - If `top` is still less than or equal to `bottom`, move from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` boundary.\n   - After traversing, decrement the `bottom` boundary by 1.\n\n7. **Traverse from Bottom to Top**:\n   - If `left` is still less than or equal to `right`, move upwards along the `left` boundary from `bottom` to `top`.\n   - After traversing, increment the `left` boundary by 1.\n\n8. **Repeat**:\n   - Repeat steps 4 to 7 until all elements are visited, i.e., until `top` exceeds `bottom` or `left` exceeds `right`.\n\n9. **Output the Result**:\n   - Collect all the elements in the order they are visited and format them as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nFollowing these steps for the given matrix, the spiral order traversal results in the following sequence:\n\n<<<9 1 6 8 9 4 5 7 8 2 0 3 9 8 1 6 7 2 1 7 2 0 6 9 5 9 4 1 3 6 9 8 4 7 1 6 3 9 5 3 9 2 1 7 8 6 4 3 9 1 7 2 4 0 3 8 3 8 9 1 9 4 8 6 4 7 8 9 6 5 8 6 8 4 9 7 1 2 3 5 9>>>\n"
