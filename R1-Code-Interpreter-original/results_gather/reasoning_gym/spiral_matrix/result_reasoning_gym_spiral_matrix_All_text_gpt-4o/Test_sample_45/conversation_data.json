    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to carefully follow the spiral traversal rules. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 6x6 matrix.\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - Start with four boundaries: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.\n   - Initially, `top = 0`, `bottom = 5`, `left = 0`, `right = 5`.\n\n3. **Traverse the Matrix in Spiral Order**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row. After traversing, increment `top` by 1.\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column. After traversing, decrement `right` by 1.\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row. After traversing, decrement `bottom` by 1.\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column. After traversing, increment `left` by 1.\n   - Repeat the above steps until `top` exceeds `bottom` or `left` exceeds `right`.\n\n4. **Collect Elements**:\n   - As you traverse, collect the elements in the order they are visited.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Format the collected elements as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- **Initial Matrix**:\n  ```\n  7 5 3 4 8 1\n  0 1 6 7 3 3\n  8 8 3 3 8 2\n  5 1 9 8 2 1\n  4 3 3 3 4 2\n  5 0 7 1 8 3\n  ```\n\n- **Spiral Order Traversal**:\n  1. Move Right: `7 5 3 4 8 1`\n  2. Move Down: `3 2 1 3`\n  3. Move Left: `8 1 7 0 5`\n  4. Move Up: `4 5 8 0`\n  5. Move Right: `1 6 7 3`\n  6. Move Down: `8 2 4`\n  7. Move Left: `3 3 3`\n  8. Move Up: `1 8`\n  9. Move Right: `3 3`\n  10. Move Down: `9`\n  11. Move Left: `1`\n\n- **Collected Elements in Spiral Order**:\n  - `7 5 3 4 8 1 3 2 1 3 8 1 7 0 5 4 5 8 0 1 6 7 3 8 2 4 3 3 3 1 8 3 3 9 1`\n\n- **Formatted Output**:\n  - <<<7 5 3 4 8 1 3 2 1 3 8 1 7 0 5 4 5 8 0 1 6 7 3 8 2 4 3 3 3 1 8 3 3 9 1>>>\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<7 5 3 4 8 1 3 2 1 3 8 1 7 0 5 4 5 8 0 1 6 7 3 8 2 4 3 3 3 1 8 3 3 9 1>>>"
