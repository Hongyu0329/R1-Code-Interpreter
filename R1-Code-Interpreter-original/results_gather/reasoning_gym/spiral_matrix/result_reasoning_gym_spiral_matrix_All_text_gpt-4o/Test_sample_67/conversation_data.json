    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is 8 rows by 8 columns.\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - Start with four boundaries: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.\n   - Initially, `top = 0`, `bottom = 7` (last row index), `left = 0`, and `right = 7` (last column index).\n\n3. **Traverse the Matrix in Spiral Order**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row. After traversing, increment the `top` boundary by 1.\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column. After traversing, decrement the `right` boundary by 1.\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row, if `top` <= `bottom`. After traversing, decrement the `bottom` boundary by 1.\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column, if `left` <= `right`. After traversing, increment the `left` boundary by 1.\n   - Repeat the above steps until the `top` boundary exceeds the `bottom` boundary or the `left` boundary exceeds the `right` boundary.\n\n4. **Collect Elements**:\n   - As you traverse, collect the elements in the order they are visited.\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - Once all elements are collected, format them as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- **Initial Boundaries**: `top = 0`, `bottom = 7`, `left = 0`, `right = 7`.\n- **Spiral Traversal**:\n  - Move Right: 8, 5, 3, 4, 7, 2, 5, 9\n  - Move Down: 8, 6, 8, 1, 8, 6, 8\n  - Move Left: 6, 7, 6, 4, 6, 2, 1\n  - Move Up: 2, 3, 9, 9, 2, 8\n  - Move Right: 2, 1, 2, 9, 7, 7\n  - Move Down: 5, 7, 0, 9, 0\n  - Move Left: 8, 3, 5, 0\n  - Move Up: 3, 3, 9\n  - Move Right: 3, 8, 6\n  - Move Down: 9, 8\n  - Move Left: 7, 7\n  - Move Up: 1\n  - Move Right: 2, 9\n  - Move Down: 8\n  - Move Left: 9\n  - Move Up: 3\n  - Move Right: 8\n\n- **Final Spiral Order**: 8, 5, 3, 4, 7, 2, 5, 9, 8, 6, 8, 1, 8, 6, 8, 6, 7, 6, 4, 6, 2, 1, 2, 3, 9, 9, 2, 8, 2, 1, 2, 9, 7, 7, 5, 7, 0, 9, 0, 8, 3, 5, 0, 3, 3, 9, 3, 8, 6, 9, 8, 7, 7, 1, 2, 9, 8, 9, 3, 8\n\n- **Formatted Output**: <<<8 5 3 4 7 2 5 9 8 6 8 1 8 6 8 6 7 6 4 6 2 1 2 3 9 9 2 8 2 1 2 9 7 7 5 7 0 9 0 8 3 5 0 3 3 9 3 8 6 9 8 7 7 1 2 9 8 9 3 8>>>\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<8 5 3 4 7 2 5 9 8 6 8 1 8 6 8 6 7 6 4 6 2 1 2 3 9 9 2 8 2 1 2 9 7 7 5 7 0 9 0 8 3 5 0 3 3 9 3 8 6 9 8 7 7 1 2 9 8 9 3 8>>>"
