    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is:\n     ```\n     6 1\n     4 4\n     ```\n   - This is a 2x2 matrix with 2 rows and 2 columns.\n\n2. **Spiral Order Traversal**:\n   - Start from the top-left corner of the matrix.\n   - Move right across the top row.\n   - Move down the last column.\n   - Move left across the bottom row.\n   - Move up the first column.\n   - Continue this pattern for any inner layers of the matrix.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Traversal**:\n   - **Start at (0,0)**: The element is `6`.\n   - **Move Right**: From (0,0) to (0,1). The element is `1`.\n   - **Move Down**: From (0,1) to (1,1). The element is `4`.\n   - **Move Left**: From (1,1) to (1,0). The element is `4`.\n   - **Move Up**: Since we have already visited all elements, we stop here.\n\n4. **Compile the Spiral Order**:\n   - The order of elements visited in spiral order is: `6, 1, 4, 4`.\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final output should be a space-separated list of these elements enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the spiral order of the given matrix.\n\n**Final Answer**: <<<6 1 4 4>>>"
