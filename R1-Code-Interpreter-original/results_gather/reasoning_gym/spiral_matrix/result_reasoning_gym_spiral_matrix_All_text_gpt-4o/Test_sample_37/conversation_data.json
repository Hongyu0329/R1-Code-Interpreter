    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to carefully analyze the matrix and follow the spiral order rules. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Structure**:  \n   The given matrix is:\n   ```\n   1 9\n   2 1\n   ```\n   This is a 2x2 matrix with 2 rows and 2 columns.\n\n2. **Identify the Spiral Order Steps**:\n   - **Start from the top-left corner**: Begin at the element in the first row and first column.\n   - **Move right**: Traverse the first row from left to right.\n   - **Move down**: Traverse the last column from top to bottom.\n   - **Move left**: Traverse the last row from right to left.\n   - **Move up**: Traverse the first column from bottom to top.\n   - Repeat the above steps for any remaining inner sub-matrix.\n\n3. **Apply the Spiral Order to the Matrix**:\n   - **Step 1**: Start at the top-left corner, which is `1`.\n   - **Step 2**: Move right across the first row. The elements are `1` and `9`.\n   - **Step 3**: Move down the last column. The next element is `1` (from the second row, second column).\n   - **Step 4**: Move left across the last row. The next element is `2` (from the second row, first column).\n   - **Step 5**: Move up the first column. However, since all elements have been visited, this step is not needed.\n\n4. **Compile the Spiral Order List**:\n   - The elements in spiral order are: `1`, `9`, `1`, `2`.\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final output should be a space-separated list of these elements enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<1 9 1 2>>>"
