    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 4x4 matrix:\n     ```\n     9 9 6 9\n     8 9 8 5\n     2 9 8 4\n     6 0 9 2\n     ```\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - We need to keep track of the boundaries of the matrix as we traverse it in a spiral order.\n   - Initialize `top` to 0, `bottom` to 3 (last row index), `left` to 0, and `right` to 3 (last column index).\n\n3. **Traverse the Matrix in Spiral Order**:\n   - **Move Right**: Start from the top-left corner and move right across the top row. Increment `top` after traversing.\n     - Elements: 9, 9, 6, 9\n     - Update `top` to 1.\n   - **Move Down**: Move down the rightmost column. Decrement `right` after traversing.\n     - Elements: 5, 4, 2\n     - Update `right` to 2.\n   - **Move Left**: Move left across the bottom row. Decrement `bottom` after traversing.\n     - Elements: 9, 0, 6\n     - Update `bottom` to 2.\n   - **Move Up**: Move up the leftmost column. Increment `left` after traversing.\n     - Elements: 2, 8\n     - Update `left` to 1.\n\n4. **Repeat for Inner Layers**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse the next inner top row.\n     - Elements: 9, 8\n     - Update `top` to 2.\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse the next inner rightmost column.\n     - Elements: 8\n     - Update `right` to 1.\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse the next inner bottom row.\n     - Elements: 9\n     - Update `bottom` to 1.\n\n5. **End Condition**:\n   - The traversal ends when `top` exceeds `bottom` or `left` exceeds `right`.\n\n6. **Compile the Result**:\n   - Collect all the elements in the order they were visited and format them as a space-separated list enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nFollowing these steps, the spiral order of the matrix is:\n\n<<<9 9 6 9 5 4 2 6 0 9 8 9 8 8 9 2>>>"
