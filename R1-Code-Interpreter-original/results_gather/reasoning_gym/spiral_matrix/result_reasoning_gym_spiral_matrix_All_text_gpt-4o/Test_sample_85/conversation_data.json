    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to carefully follow the spiral traversal rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 5x5 matrix:\n     ```\n     6 0 5 6 2\n     8 1 2 5 9\n     2 6 3 6 6\n     7 2 1 5 2\n     2 8 6 0 6\n     ```\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - Start with four boundaries: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.\n   - Initially, `top = 0`, `bottom = 4`, `left = 0`, `right = 4`.\n\n3. **Traverse the Matrix in Spiral Order**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row.\n     - Elements: 6, 0, 5, 6, 2\n     - Update `top` boundary: `top = 1`\n   \n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column.\n     - Elements: 9, 6, 2, 6\n     - Update `right` boundary: `right = 3`\n   \n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row.\n     - Elements: 0, 6, 8, 2\n     - Update `bottom` boundary: `bottom = 3`\n   \n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column.\n     - Elements: 7, 2, 8\n     - Update `left` boundary: `left = 1`\n   \n   - **Repeat the Process for Inner Layers**:\n     - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row.\n       - Elements: 1, 2, 5\n       - Update `top` boundary: `top = 2`\n     \n     - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column.\n       - Elements: 5, 1\n       - Update `right` boundary: `right = 2`\n     \n     - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row.\n       - Elements: 6, 3\n       - Update `bottom` boundary: `bottom = 2`\n     \n     - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column.\n       - Element: 6\n       - Update `left` boundary: `left = 2`\n   \n   - **Final Element**:\n     - The only remaining element is in the center of the matrix.\n     - Element: 1\n\n4. **Compile the Result**:\n   - Combine all the elements collected in spiral order into a single list.\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final output should be a space-separated list of integers enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe spiral order of the matrix is: <<<6 0 5 6 2 9 6 2 6 0 6 8 2 7 2 8 1 2 5 5 1 6 3 6 1>>>"
