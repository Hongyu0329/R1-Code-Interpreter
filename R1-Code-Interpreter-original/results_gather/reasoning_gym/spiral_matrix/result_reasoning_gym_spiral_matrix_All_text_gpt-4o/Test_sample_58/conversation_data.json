    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to carefully follow the steps of the spiral traversal. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 5x5 matrix:\n     ```\n     5 5 9 4 4\n     8 1 8 2 5\n     4 8 2 6 7\n     7 1 7 4 0\n     9 1 9 2 7\n     ```\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - Start with the following boundaries:\n     - `top` = 0 (initial top row)\n     - `bottom` = 4 (initial bottom row)\n     - `left` = 0 (initial left column)\n     - `right` = 4 (initial right column)\n\n3. **Traverse the Matrix in Spiral Order**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row.\n     - Elements: 5, 5, 9, 4, 4\n     - Update `top` boundary: `top` = 1\n\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column.\n     - Elements: 5, 7, 0, 7\n     - Update `right` boundary: `right` = 3\n\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row.\n     - Elements: 2, 9, 1, 9\n     - Update `bottom` boundary: `bottom` = 3\n\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column.\n     - Elements: 7, 4, 8\n     - Update `left` boundary: `left` = 1\n\n   - **Repeat the Process for Inner Layers**:\n     - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row.\n       - Elements: 1, 8, 2\n       - Update `top` boundary: `top` = 2\n\n     - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column.\n       - Elements: 4, 6\n       - Update `right` boundary: `right` = 2\n\n     - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row.\n       - Elements: 2, 7\n       - Update `bottom` boundary: `bottom` = 2\n\n     - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column.\n       - Elements: 8\n       - Update `left` boundary: `left` = 2\n\n     - **Final Element**: The only remaining element is at the center of the matrix.\n       - Element: 2\n\n4. **Compile the Result**:\n   - Combine all the elements collected in spiral order into a single list.\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - The final output should be a space-separated list of integers enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe spiral order of the given matrix is:\n<<<5 5 9 4 4 5 7 0 7 2 9 1 9 7 4 8 1 8 2 4 6 2 7 8 2>>>"
