    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 9x9 matrix.\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - We need to keep track of the boundaries of the matrix as we traverse it in a spiral order.\n   - Initialize `top` to 0, `bottom` to 8 (last row index), `left` to 0, and `right` to 8 (last column index).\n\n3. **Spiral Traversal**:\n   - We will traverse the matrix in a spiral order using a loop until all elements are visited.\n   - The loop will continue as long as `top <= bottom` and `left <= right`.\n\n4. **Traverse from Left to Right**:\n   - Start from the `top` row and move from `left` to `right`.\n   - Append each element to the result list.\n   - After traversing, increment `top` by 1 to move to the next row.\n\n5. **Traverse from Top to Bottom**:\n   - Move down the `right` column from `top` to `bottom`.\n   - Append each element to the result list.\n   - After traversing, decrement `right` by 1 to move to the previous column.\n\n6. **Traverse from Right to Left**:\n   - If `top <= bottom`, traverse the `bottom` row from `right` to `left`.\n   - Append each element to the result list.\n   - After traversing, decrement `bottom` by 1 to move to the previous row.\n\n7. **Traverse from Bottom to Top**:\n   - If `left <= right`, move up the `left` column from `bottom` to `top`.\n   - Append each element to the result list.\n   - After traversing, increment `left` by 1 to move to the next column.\n\n8. **Repeat**:\n   - Repeat steps 4 to 7 until all elements are visited.\n\n9. **Format the Output**:\n   - Convert the result list into a space-separated string.\n   - Enclose the string within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given matrix:\n\n- Start at the top-left corner and move right: 5, 8, 4, 3, 8, 0, 6, 4, 8\n- Move down the right column: 9, 3, 0, 3, 1, 3, 7\n- Move left along the bottom row: 0, 2, 4, 4, 9, 3, 2\n- Move up the left column: 1, 4, 7, 5, 0\n- Continue the spiral inward: 3, 3, 7, 1, 1, 4, 6, 2\n- Move down: 2, 2, 1, 2, 6\n- Move left: 1, 6, 1, 2, 7\n- Move up: 0, 8, 9\n- Continue inward: 6, 4, 6\n- Move down: 2, 3\n- Move left: 0, 3\n- Finally, the center element: 0\n\nThe final spiral order list is:\n<<<5 8 4 3 8 0 6 4 8 9 3 0 3 1 3 7 2 4 4 9 3 2 1 4 7 5 0 3 3 7 1 1 4 6 2 2 2 1 2 6 1 6 1 2 7 0 8 9 6 4 6 2 3 0 3 0>>>"
