    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The matrix provided is:\n     ```\n     9 9\n     1 9\n     ```\n   - This is a 2x2 matrix.\n\n2. **Identify the Spiral Order Process**:\n   - Start from the top-left corner and move right.\n   - Move down towards the bottom-right corner.\n   - Move left towards the bottom-left corner.\n   - Move up towards the top-right corner.\n   - Repeat the steps for the inner elements of the matrix until every entry is visited.\n\n3. **Apply the Spiral Order to the Matrix**:\n   - Start at the top-left corner (element `9` at position (0,0)).\n   - Move right to the next element in the top row (element `9` at position (0,1)).\n   - Move down to the next element in the rightmost column (element `9` at position (1,1)).\n   - Move left to the next element in the bottom row (element `1` at position (1,0)).\n\n4. **Compile the Spiral Order List**:\n   - The order of elements visited in spiral order is: 9, 9, 9, 1.\n\n5. **Format the Output**:\n   - The output should be a space-separated list of integers enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the spiral order of the given matrix.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<9 9 9 1>>>"
