    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to carefully follow the steps of the spiral traversal. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 5x5 matrix:\n     ```\n     7 3 9 3 7\n     3 5 6 7 4\n     2 5 6 5 9\n     2 6 3 0 8\n     6 6 7 3 6\n     ```\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - Start with the following boundaries:\n     - `top` = 0 (initial top row)\n     - `bottom` = 4 (initial bottom row)\n     - `left` = 0 (initial left column)\n     - `right` = 4 (initial right column)\n\n3. **Traverse the Matrix in Spiral Order**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row.\n     - Elements: 7, 3, 9, 3, 7\n     - Update `top` to 1 (move the top boundary down)\n   \n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column.\n     - Elements: 4, 9, 8, 6\n     - Update `right` to 3 (move the right boundary left)\n   \n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row.\n     - Elements: 3, 7, 6, 6\n     - Update `bottom` to 3 (move the bottom boundary up)\n   \n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column.\n     - Elements: 2, 2, 3\n     - Update `left` to 1 (move the left boundary right)\n\n4. **Repeat the Process for Inner Layers**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row.\n     - Elements: 5, 6, 7\n     - Update `top` to 2\n   \n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column.\n     - Elements: 5, 0\n     - Update `right` to 2\n   \n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row.\n     - Elements: 3, 6\n     - Update `bottom` to 2\n   \n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column.\n     - Element: 5\n     - Update `left` to 2\n\n5. **Final Inner Element**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse the remaining element in the center.\n     - Element: 6\n\n6. **Compile the Result**:\n   - Combine all the elements collected in the order they were traversed.\n\nThe final spiral order of the matrix is:\n<<<7 3 9 3 7 4 9 8 6 6 6 7 3 2 2 3 5 6 7 5 0 3 6 5 6>>>"
