    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to carefully follow the steps of the spiral traversal. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Matrix Dimensions**: \n   - The given matrix is a 5x5 matrix:\n     ```\n     1 5 5 6 8\n     4 2 3 6 1\n     6 2 4 0 0\n     3 2 7 5 2\n     3 6 5 0 6\n     ```\n\n2. **Initialize Boundaries**:\n   - Start with the following boundaries:\n     - `top` = 0 (initial row)\n     - `bottom` = 4 (last row)\n     - `left` = 0 (initial column)\n     - `right` = 4 (last column)\n\n3. **Traverse the Matrix in Spiral Order**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row.\n     - Elements: 1, 5, 5, 6, 8\n     - Update `top` boundary: `top` = 1\n\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column.\n     - Elements: 1, 0, 2, 6\n     - Update `right` boundary: `right` = 3\n\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row.\n     - Elements: 0, 5, 7, 2\n     - Update `bottom` boundary: `bottom` = 3\n\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column.\n     - Elements: 3, 6, 4\n     - Update `left` boundary: `left` = 1\n\n4. **Repeat the Process for Inner Layers**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row.\n     - Elements: 2, 3, 6\n     - Update `top` boundary: `top` = 2\n\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column.\n     - Elements: 0, 5\n     - Update `right` boundary: `right` = 2\n\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row.\n     - Elements: 7, 2\n     - Update `bottom` boundary: `bottom` = 2\n\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column.\n     - Element: 2\n     - Update `left` boundary: `left` = 2\n\n5. **Final Element**:\n   - The only remaining element is at the center of the matrix.\n     - Element: 4\n\n6. **Compile the Result**:\n   - Combine all the elements collected in spiral order.\n\nThe final spiral order of the matrix is:\n<<<1 5 5 6 8 1 0 2 6 0 5 7 2 3 6 4 2 3 6 0 5 7 2 2 4>>>"
