    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to carefully follow the spiral traversal rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - Start at the top-left corner of the matrix.\n   - Define boundaries for the traversal: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.\n   - Initially, `top = 0`, `bottom = number of rows - 1`, `left = 0`, `right = number of columns - 1`.\n\n2. **Spiral Traversal**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row. After traversing, increment `top` to move to the next row.\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column. After traversing, decrement `right` to move to the previous column.\n   - **Move Left**: If `top` is still less than or equal to `bottom`, traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row. After traversing, decrement `bottom` to move to the previous row.\n   - **Move Up**: If `left` is still less than or equal to `right`, traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column. After traversing, increment `left` to move to the next column.\n   - Repeat the above steps until all elements are visited.\n\n3. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure that after each move, the boundaries are checked to prevent re-traversing already visited rows or columns.\n   - Handle single row or single column matrices appropriately.\n\n4. **Output**:\n   - Collect all visited elements in a list and format them as a space-separated string enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply this process to the given matrix:\n\n```\n9 2 1 7 0 5 3 2 4\n9 1 8 3 6 1 0 5 4\n2 0 0 4 8 6 0 9 9\n4 9 1 8 8 6 0 1 7\n9 1 4 1 1 8 5 6 1\n1 3 5 7 2 8 7 9 1\n0 9 9 8 1 6 9 1 1\n6 3 2 7 2 8 0 2 8\n4 0 2 3 5 9 2 5 2\n```\n\n- Start at the top-left corner (9).\n- Move right across the top row: 9, 2, 1, 7, 0, 5, 3, 2, 4.\n- Move down the right column: 4, 9, 7, 1, 1, 1, 8, 2.\n- Move left across the bottom row: 5, 2, 9, 5, 3, 2, 0, 4.\n- Move up the left column: 6, 0, 1, 9, 4, 2.\n- Continue the spiral inward, repeating the process for the inner layers.\n\nFollowing these steps, the spiral order of the matrix is:\n\n<<<9 2 1 7 0 5 3 2 4 4 9 9 7 1 1 1 8 2 5 2 9 5 3 2 0 4 6 0 1 9 4 2 0 9 9 8 1 6 9 1 8 6 8 8 4 1 3 5 7 2 8 7 0 8 2 7 2 8 6 1 0 6 5 8 6 0 0 1 8 3 6 1 0 5>>>\n\nThis is the list of elements in spiral order for the given matrix."
