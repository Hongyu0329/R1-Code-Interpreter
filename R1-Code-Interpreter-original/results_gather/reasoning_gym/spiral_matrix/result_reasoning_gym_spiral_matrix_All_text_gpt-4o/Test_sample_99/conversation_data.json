    "To solve the problem of generating a list of elements in spiral order from the given matrix, we need to carefully follow the spiral traversal rules. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: \n   - We have a 7x7 matrix.\n   - Define boundaries: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.\n   - Initially, `top = 0`, `bottom = 6`, `left = 0`, `right = 6`.\n\n2. **Spiral Traversal**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row.\n     - Elements: 7, 7, 7, 6, 8, 6, 6\n     - Update `top` to 1.\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column.\n     - Elements: 7, 3, 5, 4\n     - Update `right` to 5.\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row.\n     - Elements: 3, 5, 5, 0, 9, 2\n     - Update `bottom` to 5.\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column.\n     - Elements: 6, 7, 0, 1, 3\n     - Update `left` to 1.\n\n3. **Repeat the Process**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row.\n     - Elements: 9, 0, 1, 0, 6\n     - Update `top` to 2.\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column.\n     - Elements: 9, 1, 2\n     - Update `right` to 4.\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row.\n     - Elements: 2, 9, 2, 9\n     - Update `bottom` to 4.\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column.\n     - Elements: 9, 3\n     - Update `left` to 2.\n\n4. **Continue the Process**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row.\n     - Elements: 2, 8, 1\n     - Update `top` to 3.\n   - **Move Down**: Traverse from `top` to `bottom` along the `right` column.\n     - Elements: 1\n     - Update `right` to 3.\n   - **Move Left**: Traverse from `right` to `left` along the `bottom` row.\n     - Elements: 1, 1\n     - Update `bottom` to 3.\n   - **Move Up**: Traverse from `bottom` to `top` along the `left` column.\n     - Elements: 1\n     - Update `left` to 3.\n\n5. **Final Element**:\n   - **Move Right**: Traverse from `left` to `right` along the `top` row.\n     - Element: 8\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - Combine all the elements collected in spiral order into a single list.\n\nThe final spiral order of the matrix is:\n<<<7 7 7 6 8 6 6 7 3 5 4 3 5 5 0 9 2 6 7 0 1 3 9 0 1 0 6 9 1 2 2 9 2 9 9 3 2 8 1 1 1 1 8>>>\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n<<<7 7 7 6 8 6 6 7 3 5 4 3 5 5 0 9 2 6 7 0 1 3 9 0 1 0 6 9 1 2 2 9 2 9 9 3 2 8 1 1 1 1 8>>>"
