    "\nassistant > To generate the list of elements in spiral order for the given matrix, we can follow the steps outlined in the problem statement. Let's first represent the matrix:\n\n```\n9 7\n3 9\n```\n\nNow, let's generate the spiral order:\n\n1. Start from the top-left corner and move right: `9, 7`\n2. Move down towards the bottom-right corner: `9`\n3. Move left towards the bottom-left corner: `3`\n4. Move up towards the top-right corner: (No elements left to move up)\n\nThe spiral order for the given matrix is: `9, 7, 9, 3`\n\nLet's format this as a space-separated list of integers enclosed within triple angle brackets: `<<<9 7 9 3>>>`"
