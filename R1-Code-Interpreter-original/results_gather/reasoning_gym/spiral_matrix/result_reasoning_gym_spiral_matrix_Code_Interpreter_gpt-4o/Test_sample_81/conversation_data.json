  "question": "Given a matrix, your job is to generate a list of elements in spiral order, starting from the top-left element.\n\nThe spiral order is clockwise, starting from the top-left corner. More precisely:\n- Start from the top-left corner and move right.\n- Move down towards the bottom-right corner.\n- Move left towards the bottom-left corner.\n- Move up towards the top-right corner.\n- Repeat the steps for the inner elements of the matrix until every entry is visited.\n\nYour output should be a space-separated list of integers enclosed within triple angle brackets, e.g. <<<1 2 3 4 5 6>>>\n\nFor the matrix below, what is the list of elements in spiral order?\n8 0\n4 7\n",

    "\nassistant > To generate the spiral order of the given matrix, we will follow the steps outlined in the problem statement. Let's first represent the matrix:\n\n```\n8 0\n4 7\n```\n\nNow, let's generate the spiral order:\n\n1. Start from the top-left corner and move right: `8, 0`\n2. Move down towards the bottom-right corner: `7`\n3. Move left towards the bottom-left corner: `4`\n4. Move up towards the top-right corner: (no elements left to move up)\n\nThe spiral order of the matrix is: `8, 0, 7, 4`\n\nLet's format this as a space-separated list of integers enclosed within triple angle brackets: \n\n<<<8 0 7 4>>>"
