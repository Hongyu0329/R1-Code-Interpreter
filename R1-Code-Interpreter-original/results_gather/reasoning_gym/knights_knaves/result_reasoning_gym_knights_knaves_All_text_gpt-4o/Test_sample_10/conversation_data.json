  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by sages and fools. Sages always tell the truth, and fools always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Zoey, and Riley. Zoey commented, \"Riley is a fool\". In Riley's words: \"Zoey is a sage or Riley is a sage\". So who is a sage and who is a fool? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Zoey is a sage/fool, and Riley is a sage/fool>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Zoey and Riley, keeping in mind the characteristics of sages and fools:\n\n1. **Zoey's Statement**: \"Riley is a fool.\"\n   - If Zoey is a sage, then her statement is true, which means Riley is indeed a fool.\n   - If Zoey is a fool, then her statement is false, which means Riley is not a fool (i.e., Riley is a sage).\n\n2. **Riley's Statement**: \"Zoey is a sage or Riley is a sage.\"\n   - If Riley is a sage, then the statement must be true. This means at least one of the conditions \"Zoey is a sage\" or \"Riley is a sage\" is true.\n   - If Riley is a fool, then the statement must be false. This means neither \"Zoey is a sage\" nor \"Riley is a sage\" is true, implying both are fools.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1**: Assume Zoey is a sage.\n  - If Zoey is a sage, her statement \"Riley is a fool\" is true. Therefore, Riley is a fool.\n  - If Riley is a fool, then Riley's statement \"Zoey is a sage or Riley is a sage\" must be false. Since Riley is a fool, the statement is indeed false, which is consistent with our assumption that Zoey is a sage and Riley is a fool.\n\n- **Scenario 2**: Assume Zoey is a fool.\n  - If Zoey is a fool, her statement \"Riley is a fool\" is false. Therefore, Riley is a sage.\n  - If Riley is a sage, then Riley's statement \"Zoey is a sage or Riley is a sage\" must be true. Since Riley is a sage, the statement is true, which is consistent with our assumption that Zoey is a fool and Riley is a sage.\n\nBoth scenarios are logically consistent, but we need to determine which one is correct. Let's consider the implications:\n\n- In Scenario 1, Zoey is a sage and Riley is a fool. This scenario is consistent with both statements.\n- In Scenario 2, Zoey is a fool and Riley is a sage. This scenario is also consistent with both statements.\n\nHowever, the problem does not provide additional information to definitively choose between the two scenarios. Therefore, both scenarios are possible solutions based on the given statements.\n\nSince the problem asks for a definitive answer, we must choose the scenario that aligns with the logical consistency of the statements. Given the nature of the problem, the most straightforward interpretation is that Zoey is a sage and Riley is a fool, as this directly aligns with the initial statement made by Zoey.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<Zoey is a sage, and Riley is a fool>>>"
