  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Sebastian, and Zoey. \"Zoey is a knight or Zoey is a knave,\" Sebastian claimed. Zoey remarked, \"Sebastian is a knight\". So who is a knight and who is a knave? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Sebastian is a knight/knave, and Zoey is a knight/knave>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Sebastian and Zoey, considering the nature of knights and knaves.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - Sebastian says, \"Zoey is a knight or Zoey is a knave.\"\n   - Zoey says, \"Sebastian is a knight.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing Sebastian's Statement:**\n   - Sebastian's statement \"Zoey is a knight or Zoey is a knave\" is a tautology. This means it is always true because every inhabitant must be either a knight or a knave. Therefore, Sebastian's statement does not provide any information about his own identity. Whether he is a knight or a knave, the statement remains true.\n\n3. **Analyzing Zoey's Statement:**\n   - Zoey says, \"Sebastian is a knight.\"\n   - If Zoey is a knight, she tells the truth, so Sebastian must indeed be a knight.\n   - If Zoey is a knave, she lies, so Sebastian cannot be a knight, meaning he must be a knave.\n\n4. **Considering the Possibilities:**\n   - **Case 1:** Assume Zoey is a knight.\n     - If Zoey is a knight, her statement \"Sebastian is a knight\" is true. Therefore, Sebastian is a knight.\n     - This scenario is consistent: Zoey is a knight, and Sebastian is a knight.\n\n   - **Case 2:** Assume Zoey is a knave.\n     - If Zoey is a knave, her statement \"Sebastian is a knight\" is false. Therefore, Sebastian is a knave.\n     - This scenario is also consistent: Zoey is a knave, and Sebastian is a knave.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Both scenarios are internally consistent, but we need to determine which one is possible given the constraints.\n   - Since Sebastian's statement is always true, it does not help us distinguish between the two scenarios.\n   - The only way to resolve this is to consider the implications of Zoey's statement. If Zoey were a knight, both would be knights, which is possible. If Zoey were a knave, both would be knaves, which is also possible.\n\nHowever, the problem does not provide additional constraints to definitively choose between the two consistent scenarios. Therefore, based on the given statements, both scenarios are logically possible.\n\nGiven the nature of the problem, the most straightforward interpretation is that Zoey's statement is true, leading to the conclusion that both are knights.\n\n<<<Sebastian is a knight, and Zoey is a knight>>>"
