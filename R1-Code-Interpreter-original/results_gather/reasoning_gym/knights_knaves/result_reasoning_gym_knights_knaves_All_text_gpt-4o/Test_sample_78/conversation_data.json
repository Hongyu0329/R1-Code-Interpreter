  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by sages and fools. Sages always tell the truth, and fools always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Sebastian, and Benjamin. \"Benjamin is a fool,\" Sebastian declared. Benjamin remarked, \"Sebastian is a sage if and only if Benjamin is a sage\". So who is a sage and who is a fool? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Sebastian is a sage/fool, and Benjamin is a sage/fool>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Sebastian and Benjamin and determine who is a sage and who is a fool. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Characters:**\n   - Sages always tell the truth.\n   - Fools always lie.\n\n2. **Statements:**\n   - Sebastian says, \"Benjamin is a fool.\"\n   - Benjamin says, \"Sebastian is a sage if and only if Benjamin is a sage.\"\n\n3. **Analyzing Sebastian's Statement:**\n   - If Sebastian is a sage, then his statement is true, meaning Benjamin is a fool.\n   - If Sebastian is a fool, then his statement is false, meaning Benjamin is a sage.\n\n4. **Analyzing Benjamin's Statement:**\n   - Benjamin's statement is a biconditional: \"Sebastian is a sage if and only if Benjamin is a sage.\"\n   - This means both must be the same (either both are sages or both are fools) for the statement to be true.\n\n5. **Case Analysis:**\n\n   **Case 1: Sebastian is a sage.**\n   - If Sebastian is a sage, his statement \"Benjamin is a fool\" is true.\n   - Therefore, Benjamin must be a fool.\n   - However, if Benjamin is a fool, his statement must be false.\n   - Benjamin's statement \"Sebastian is a sage if and only if Benjamin is a sage\" would be false if Sebastian is a sage and Benjamin is a fool, which is consistent with Benjamin being a fool.\n\n   **Case 2: Sebastian is a fool.**\n   - If Sebastian is a fool, his statement \"Benjamin is a fool\" is false.\n   - Therefore, Benjamin must be a sage.\n   - If Benjamin is a sage, his statement must be true.\n   - Benjamin's statement \"Sebastian is a sage if and only if Benjamin is a sage\" would be true if both are sages or both are fools, but since Benjamin is a sage and Sebastian is a fool, this creates a contradiction.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only consistent scenario is Case 1, where Sebastian is a sage and Benjamin is a fool.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<Sebastian is a sage, and Benjamin is a fool>>>."
