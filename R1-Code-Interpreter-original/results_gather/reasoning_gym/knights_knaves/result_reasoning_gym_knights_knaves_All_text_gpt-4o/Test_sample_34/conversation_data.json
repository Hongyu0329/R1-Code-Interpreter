  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by angels and devils. Angels always tell the truth, and devils always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Luke, and Penelope. Luke was heard saying, \"Penelope is a devil\". Penelope commented, \"if Penelope is an angel then Luke is a devil\". So who is an angel and who is a devil? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Luke is a angel/devil, and Penelope is a angel/devil>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Luke and Penelope, considering the nature of angels and devils on the island.\n\n1. **Understanding the Characters:**\n   - Angels always tell the truth.\n   - Devils always lie.\n\n2. **Statements:**\n   - Luke says, \"Penelope is a devil.\"\n   - Penelope says, \"If Penelope is an angel, then Luke is a devil.\"\n\n3. **Analyzing Luke's Statement:**\n   - If Luke is an angel, his statement is true, which means Penelope is a devil.\n   - If Luke is a devil, his statement is false, which means Penelope is an angel.\n\n4. **Analyzing Penelope's Statement:**\n   - Penelope's statement is a conditional statement: \"If Penelope is an angel, then Luke is a devil.\"\n   - If Penelope is an angel, she tells the truth, so the statement \"Luke is a devil\" must be true.\n   - If Penelope is a devil, she lies, so the statement \"If Penelope is an angel, then Luke is a devil\" is false. This means that if Penelope were an angel, Luke would not be a devil, which implies Luke is an angel.\n\n5. **Combining the Analysis:**\n   - **Case 1:** Assume Luke is an angel.\n     - Then his statement \"Penelope is a devil\" is true.\n     - Penelope, being a devil, would lie, making her statement false. This is consistent because if Penelope were an angel, Luke would not be a devil (since Luke is an angel).\n\n   - **Case 2:** Assume Luke is a devil.\n     - Then his statement \"Penelope is a devil\" is false, meaning Penelope is an angel.\n     - Penelope, being an angel, tells the truth, so her statement \"If Penelope is an angel, then Luke is a devil\" must be true. This is consistent because Luke is indeed a devil.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Both cases are consistent with the nature of angels and devils. However, the only consistent scenario where both statements align with their nature is:\n     - Luke is a devil (his statement is false).\n     - Penelope is an angel (her statement is true).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: <<<Luke is a devil, and Penelope is an angel>>>."
