  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by sages and fools. Sages always tell the truth, and fools always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Daniel, and Sebastian. Daniel asserted: \"Sebastian is a sage and Daniel is a sage\". Sebastian commented, \"Daniel is a fool if and only if Daniel is a sage\". So who is a sage and who is a fool? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Daniel is a sage/fool, and Sebastian is a sage/fool>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Daniel and Sebastian, considering the nature of sages and fools on the island.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - **Daniel's Statement:** \"Sebastian is a sage and Daniel is a sage.\"\n   - **Sebastian's Statement:** \"Daniel is a fool if and only if Daniel is a sage.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing Daniel's Statement:**\n   - If Daniel is a sage, then his statement is true. This means both \"Sebastian is a sage\" and \"Daniel is a sage\" must be true.\n   - If Daniel is a fool, then his statement is false. This means at least one of \"Sebastian is a sage\" or \"Daniel is a sage\" is false.\n\n3. **Analyzing Sebastian's Statement:**\n   - The statement \"Daniel is a fool if and only if Daniel is a sage\" is a logical equivalence, which can be broken down as:\n     - If Daniel is a fool, then Daniel is a sage.\n     - If Daniel is a sage, then Daniel is a fool.\n   - This statement is a contradiction because it implies that Daniel is both a sage and a fool simultaneously, which is impossible.\n\n4. **Logical Deductions:**\n   - Since Sebastian's statement is a contradiction, it cannot be true. Therefore, Sebastian must be a fool.\n   - If Sebastian is a fool, his statement is false. This means \"Daniel is a fool if and only if Daniel is a sage\" is false, which implies Daniel is not both a sage and a fool.\n   - Since Sebastian is a fool, Daniel's statement \"Sebastian is a sage and Daniel is a sage\" must be false. Therefore, at least one part of the statement is false.\n   - We already know Sebastian is a fool, so the part \"Sebastian is a sage\" is false, which aligns with Daniel being a sage.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Daniel is a sage because his statement is consistent with the fact that Sebastian is a fool.\n   - Sebastian is a fool because his statement is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: <<<Daniel is a sage, and Sebastian is a fool>>>."
