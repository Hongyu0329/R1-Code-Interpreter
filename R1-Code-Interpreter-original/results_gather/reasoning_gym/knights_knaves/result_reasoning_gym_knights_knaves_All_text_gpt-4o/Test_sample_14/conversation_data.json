  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by altruists and egoists. Altruists always tell the truth, and egoists always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Mason, and Jack. Mason expressed that if Jack is an egoist then Mason is an altruist. In Jack's words: \"Mason is an egoist\". So who is an altruist and who is an egoist? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Mason is a altruist/egoist, and Jack is a altruist/egoist>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Mason and Jack and determine their truthfulness based on the characteristics of altruists and egoists.\n\n1. **Understanding the Characters:**\n   - Altruists always tell the truth.\n   - Egoists always lie.\n\n2. **Statements:**\n   - Mason says: \"If Jack is an egoist, then Mason is an altruist.\"\n   - Jack says: \"Mason is an egoist.\"\n\n3. **Analyzing Mason's Statement:**\n   - Mason's statement is a conditional statement: \"If Jack is an egoist, then Mason is an altruist.\"\n   - Let's consider the possibilities:\n     - If Mason is an altruist, his statement must be true. Therefore, if Jack is an egoist, Mason is indeed an altruist, which is consistent.\n     - If Mason is an egoist, his statement must be false. The statement \"If Jack is an egoist, then Mason is an altruist\" being false implies that Jack is an egoist, but Mason is not an altruist, which is consistent with Mason being an egoist.\n\n4. **Analyzing Jack's Statement:**\n   - Jack says: \"Mason is an egoist.\"\n   - Let's consider the possibilities:\n     - If Jack is an altruist, his statement must be true, meaning Mason is indeed an egoist.\n     - If Jack is an egoist, his statement must be false, meaning Mason is not an egoist, so Mason is an altruist.\n\n5. **Combining the Analysis:**\n   - If Mason is an altruist, his statement is true, which means if Jack is an egoist, Mason is an altruist. This is consistent with Jack being an egoist.\n   - If Jack is an egoist, his statement \"Mason is an egoist\" is false, meaning Mason is an altruist.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only consistent scenario is that Mason is an altruist and Jack is an egoist. This satisfies both Mason's and Jack's statements under the rules of altruists and egoists.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Mason is an altruist, and Jack is an egoist>>>"
