  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by sages and fools. Sages always tell the truth, and fools always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Ethan, and Noah. In a statement by Ethan: \"Noah is a fool and Noah is a sage\". Noah was heard saying, \"if Ethan is a sage then Ethan is a fool\". So who is a sage and who is a fool? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Ethan is a sage/fool, and Noah is a sage/fool>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Ethan and Noah, considering the nature of sages and fools on the island.\n\n1. **Understanding the Characters:**\n   - Sages always tell the truth.\n   - Fools always lie.\n\n2. **Analyzing Ethan's Statement:**\n   - Ethan says, \"Noah is a fool and Noah is a sage.\"\n   - This statement is a contradiction because one cannot be both a fool and a sage simultaneously.\n   - If Ethan were a sage, he would tell the truth, but his statement is inherently contradictory, which means Ethan cannot be a sage.\n   - Therefore, Ethan must be a fool.\n\n3. **Analyzing Noah's Statement:**\n   - Noah says, \"If Ethan is a sage then Ethan is a fool.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. Let's analyze it:\n     - If the premise \"Ethan is a sage\" is true, then the conclusion \"Ethan is a fool\" must also be true for Noah's statement to be true.\n     - However, if Ethan is a sage, he cannot be a fool, which makes the conclusion false.\n     - Therefore, the entire statement \"If Ethan is a sage then Ethan is a fool\" would be false if Ethan were a sage.\n   - Since Noah's statement would be false if Ethan were a sage, and Noah is not lying (because we are assuming he could be a sage), Ethan cannot be a sage.\n   - Since Ethan is already determined to be a fool, Noah's statement is consistent with him being a sage because the premise \"Ethan is a sage\" is false, making the conditional statement true regardless of the conclusion.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Ethan is a fool because his statement is contradictory and cannot be true.\n   - Noah is a sage because his statement is logically consistent with Ethan being a fool.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: <<<Ethan is a fool, and Noah is a sage>>>."
