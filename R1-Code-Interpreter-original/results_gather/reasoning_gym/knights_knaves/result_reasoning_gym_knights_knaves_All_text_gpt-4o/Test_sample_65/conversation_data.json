  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by sages and fools. Sages always tell the truth, and fools always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Mason, and Noah. Mason noted, \"Mason is a sage or Noah is a sage\". \"Mason is a fool if and only if Noah is a sage,\" Noah claimed. So who is a sage and who is a fool? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Mason is a sage/fool, and Noah is a sage/fool>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Mason and Noah and determine who is a sage and who is a fool. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - Mason says, \"Mason is a sage or Noah is a sage.\"\n   - Noah says, \"Mason is a fool if and only if Noah is a sage.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing Mason's Statement:**\n   - If Mason is a sage, then his statement is true. This means either Mason is a sage (which is consistent) or Noah is a sage.\n   - If Mason is a fool, then his statement is false. This means neither Mason is a sage nor Noah is a sage, which implies both are fools.\n\n3. **Analyzing Noah's Statement:**\n   - Noah's statement is a biconditional: \"Mason is a fool if and only if Noah is a sage.\"\n   - If Noah is a sage, then his statement is true. This means Mason is a fool.\n   - If Noah is a fool, then his statement is false. This means Mason is not a fool, so Mason is a sage.\n\n4. **Considering Possible Scenarios:**\n   - **Scenario 1: Mason is a sage.**\n     - Mason's statement is true, so either Mason is a sage (which is consistent) or Noah is a sage.\n     - If Mason is a sage, Noah's statement must be false (since Noah is a fool), which means Mason is not a fool, consistent with Mason being a sage.\n\n   - **Scenario 2: Mason is a fool.**\n     - Mason's statement is false, so neither Mason is a sage nor Noah is a sage, which means both are fools.\n     - If Mason is a fool, Noah's statement must be true (since Noah is a sage), which means Mason is a fool, consistent with the assumption.\n\n5. **Evaluating Consistency:**\n   - In Scenario 1, if Mason is a sage, Noah must be a fool for the statements to be consistent.\n   - In Scenario 2, if Mason is a fool, Noah must be a sage for the statements to be consistent.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Scenario 1 is consistent: Mason is a sage, and Noah is a fool.\n   - Scenario 2 is inconsistent because it leads to a contradiction in Noah's statement.\n\nTherefore, the only consistent scenario is that Mason is a sage and Noah is a fool.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n<<<Mason is a sage, and Noah is a fool>>>"
