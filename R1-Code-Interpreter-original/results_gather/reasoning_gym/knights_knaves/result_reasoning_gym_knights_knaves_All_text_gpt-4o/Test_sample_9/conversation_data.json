  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by altruists and egoists. Altruists always tell the truth, and egoists always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Benjamin, and Mason. Benjamin was heard saying, \"Benjamin is an altruist or Mason is an egoist\". As Mason put it, \"Benjamin is an egoist if and only if Benjamin is an altruist\". So who is an altruist and who is an egoist? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Benjamin is a altruist/egoist, and Mason is a altruist/egoist>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Benjamin and Mason, considering the nature of altruists and egoists.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - Benjamin says: \"Benjamin is an altruist or Mason is an egoist.\"\n   - Mason says: \"Benjamin is an egoist if and only if Benjamin is an altruist.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing Benjamin's Statement:**\n   - If Benjamin is an altruist (truth-teller), then his statement \"Benjamin is an altruist or Mason is an egoist\" must be true. This means either Benjamin is indeed an altruist, or Mason is an egoist, or both.\n   - If Benjamin is an egoist (liar), then his statement must be false. This means neither \"Benjamin is an altruist\" nor \"Mason is an egoist\" is true. Therefore, Benjamin is an egoist and Mason is an altruist.\n\n3. **Analyzing Mason's Statement:**\n   - Mason says: \"Benjamin is an egoist if and only if Benjamin is an altruist.\"\n   - This statement is a logical contradiction because it implies that Benjamin is both an egoist and an altruist simultaneously, which is impossible.\n   - If Mason is an altruist, his statement must be true, but since the statement is a contradiction, Mason cannot be an altruist.\n   - Therefore, Mason must be an egoist, meaning his statement is false.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Mason is an egoist, his statement is false, which aligns with our analysis that Mason cannot be an altruist.\n   - If Mason is an egoist, then Benjamin's statement \"Benjamin is an altruist or Mason is an egoist\" can be true if Benjamin is an altruist.\n   - Therefore, Benjamin must be an altruist.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Benjamin is an altruist, and Mason is an egoist>>>"
