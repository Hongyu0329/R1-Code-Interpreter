  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by sages and fools. Sages always tell the truth, and fools always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Zoey, and Joseph. Zoey said, \"if Joseph is a sage then Joseph is a fool.\" According to Joseph, \"Zoey is a fool and Zoey is a sage\". So who is a sage and who is a fool? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Zoey is a sage/fool, and Joseph is a sage/fool>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Zoey and Joseph, keeping in mind the characteristics of sages and fools:\n\n1. **Zoey's Statement: \"If Joseph is a sage then Joseph is a fool.\"**\n   - This is a conditional statement. Let's break it down:\n     - If Joseph is a sage, then according to Zoey, Joseph is a fool. This creates a contradiction because a person cannot be both a sage and a fool simultaneously.\n     - If Zoey is a sage (truth-teller), then her statement must be true. However, the statement itself is a contradiction if Joseph is a sage. Therefore, Joseph cannot be a sage if Zoey is telling the truth.\n     - If Zoey is a fool (liar), then her statement is false. This means that the opposite of her statement is true: \"If Joseph is a sage, then Joseph is not a fool.\" This is logically consistent because a sage cannot be a fool.\n\n2. **Joseph's Statement: \"Zoey is a fool and Zoey is a sage.\"**\n   - Joseph claims that Zoey is both a fool and a sage, which is a direct contradiction.\n   - If Joseph is a sage (truth-teller), his statement must be true. However, it is impossible for Zoey to be both a fool and a sage simultaneously. Therefore, Joseph cannot be a sage.\n   - If Joseph is a fool (liar), his statement is false. This means that Zoey is neither a fool nor a sage, which is not possible since every inhabitant is either a sage or a fool. However, the falsehood of his statement implies that Zoey is not both a fool and a sage, which is consistent with the rules.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - From Zoey's statement, if she is a sage, Joseph cannot be a sage. If she is a fool, her statement is false, which is consistent with Joseph being a sage.\n   - From Joseph's statement, he cannot be a sage because his statement is a contradiction. Therefore, Joseph must be a fool.\n   - Since Joseph is a fool, Zoey's statement \"If Joseph is a sage then Joseph is a fool\" is consistent with Joseph being a fool, which means Zoey can be a sage.\n\nTherefore, the logical conclusion is:\n<<<Zoey is a sage, and Joseph is a fool>>>"
