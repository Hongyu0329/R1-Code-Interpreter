  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by saints and sinners. Saints always tell the truth, and sinners always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Isabella, and Joseph. \"Joseph is a sinner,\" Isabella declared. In Joseph's words: \"Isabella is a saint if and only if Joseph is a saint\". So who is a saint and who is a sinner? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Isabella is a saint/sinner, and Joseph is a saint/sinner>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Isabella and Joseph and determine their truthfulness based on the characteristics of saints and sinners.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - Isabella says, \"Joseph is a sinner.\"\n   - Joseph says, \"Isabella is a saint if and only if Joseph is a saint.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing Isabella's Statement:**\n   - If Isabella is a saint, she tells the truth. Therefore, Joseph must be a sinner.\n   - If Isabella is a sinner, she lies. Therefore, Joseph must be a saint.\n\n3. **Analyzing Joseph's Statement:**\n   - Joseph's statement is a biconditional: \"Isabella is a saint if and only if Joseph is a saint.\"\n   - This means both must be saints or both must be sinners for the statement to be true.\n\n4. **Case Analysis:**\n   - **Case 1: Isabella is a saint.**\n     - If Isabella is a saint, her statement \"Joseph is a sinner\" is true. Therefore, Joseph is a sinner.\n     - However, if Joseph is a sinner, his statement \"Isabella is a saint if and only if Joseph is a saint\" would be false, because a sinner cannot make a true statement.\n     - This leads to a contradiction because Joseph's statement would be false if he were a sinner, but Isabella being a saint implies Joseph is a sinner. Therefore, this case is not possible.\n\n   - **Case 2: Isabella is a sinner.**\n     - If Isabella is a sinner, her statement \"Joseph is a sinner\" is false. Therefore, Joseph is a saint.\n     - If Joseph is a saint, his statement \"Isabella is a saint if and only if Joseph is a saint\" must be true.\n     - For Joseph's statement to be true, both parts of the biconditional must be true or both must be false. Since Joseph is a saint, the statement \"Isabella is a saint\" must be false, which is consistent with Isabella being a sinner.\n     - This case does not lead to any contradictions.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only consistent scenario is that Isabella is a sinner and Joseph is a saint.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<Isabella is a sinner, and Joseph is a saint>>>."
