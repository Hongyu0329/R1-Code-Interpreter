  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by heros and villains. Heros always tell the truth, and villains always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Abigail, and Mason. \"Mason is a villain and Mason is a hero,\" Abigail declared. \"Abigail is a hero,\" Mason mentioned. So who is a hero and who is a villain? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Abigail is a hero/villain, and Mason is a hero/villain>>>)",
  "response_list": [
    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Abigail and Mason, keeping in mind that heroes always tell the truth and villains always lie.\n\n1. **Analyze Abigail's Statement:**\n   - Abigail says, \"Mason is a villain and Mason is a hero.\"\n   - This statement is a contradiction because Mason cannot be both a villain and a hero at the same time.\n   - If Abigail were a hero (truth-teller), her statement would have to be true. However, since her statement is a contradiction, it cannot be true.\n   - Therefore, Abigail cannot be a hero. She must be a villain (liar).\n\n2. **Analyze Mason's Statement:**\n   - Mason says, \"Abigail is a hero.\"\n   - We have already determined that Abigail is a villain.\n   - If Mason were a hero (truth-teller), his statement would have to be true, which would mean Abigail is a hero. But we know Abigail is a villain, so Mason cannot be a hero.\n   - Therefore, Mason must be a villain (liar).\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Both Abigail and Mason are villains because their statements are false.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Abigail is a villain, and Mason is a villain>>>"
