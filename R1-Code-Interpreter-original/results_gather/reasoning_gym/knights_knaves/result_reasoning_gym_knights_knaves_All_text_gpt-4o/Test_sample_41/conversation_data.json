  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by altruists and egoists. Altruists always tell the truth, and egoists always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Elizabeth, and Olivia. In Elizabeth's words: \"Olivia is an egoist if and only if Olivia is an altruist\". \"Elizabeth is an altruist,\" Olivia mentioned. So who is an altruist and who is an egoist? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Elizabeth is a altruist/egoist, and Olivia is a altruist/egoist>>>)",
  "response_list": [
    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Elizabeth and Olivia and determine who is telling the truth and who is lying. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - Elizabeth says: \"Olivia is an egoist if and only if Olivia is an altruist.\"\n   - Olivia says: \"Elizabeth is an altruist.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing Elizabeth's Statement:**\n   - The statement \"Olivia is an egoist if and only if Olivia is an altruist\" is a logical contradiction. It means Olivia is an egoist if and only if she is an altruist, which is impossible because one cannot be both simultaneously.\n   - If Elizabeth is an altruist (truth-teller), she would not make a contradictory statement. Therefore, Elizabeth must be lying, which means she is an egoist.\n\n3. **Analyzing Olivia's Statement:**\n   - Olivia says: \"Elizabeth is an altruist.\"\n   - Since we have determined that Elizabeth is an egoist, Olivia's statement is false.\n   - If Olivia's statement is false, then Olivia must be an egoist as well, because altruists always tell the truth.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Both Elizabeth and Olivia are egoists because both made false statements.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: <<<Elizabeth is an egoist, and Olivia is an egoist>>>."
