  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by altruists and egoists. Altruists always tell the truth, and egoists always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Owen, and Benjamin. Owen stated, \"Benjamin is an egoist and Owen is an altruist\". \"Owen is an altruist if and only if Benjamin is an altruist,\" Benjamin mentioned. So who is an altruist and who is an egoist? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Owen is a altruist/egoist, and Benjamin is a altruist/egoist>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Owen and Benjamin and determine who is an altruist and who is an egoist.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - Owen's statement: \"Benjamin is an egoist and Owen is an altruist.\"\n   - Benjamin's statement: \"Owen is an altruist if and only if Benjamin is an altruist.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing Owen's Statement:**\n   - If Owen is an altruist (truth-teller), then his statement must be true. This means Benjamin is an egoist, and Owen is an altruist.\n   - If Owen is an egoist (liar), then his statement must be false. This means Benjamin is not an egoist (i.e., Benjamin is an altruist), and Owen is not an altruist (i.e., Owen is an egoist).\n\n3. **Analyzing Benjamin's Statement:**\n   - Benjamin's statement is a biconditional: \"Owen is an altruist if and only if Benjamin is an altruist.\"\n   - If Benjamin is an altruist (truth-teller), then the statement is true. This means both Owen and Benjamin are altruists, or both are egoists.\n   - If Benjamin is an egoist (liar), then the statement is false. This means one of them is an altruist, and the other is an egoist.\n\n4. **Combining the Analysis:**\n   - Assume Owen is an altruist:\n     - Owen's statement is true: Benjamin is an egoist, and Owen is an altruist.\n     - Benjamin's statement must be false (since Benjamin is an egoist): \"Owen is an altruist if and only if Benjamin is an altruist\" is false. This is consistent because Owen is an altruist and Benjamin is an egoist.\n   - Assume Owen is an egoist:\n     - Owen's statement is false: Benjamin is an altruist, and Owen is an egoist.\n     - Benjamin's statement must be true (since Benjamin is an altruist): \"Owen is an altruist if and only if Benjamin is an altruist\" is true. This is inconsistent because Owen is an egoist and Benjamin is an altruist.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only consistent scenario is when Owen is an altruist and Benjamin is an egoist.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<Owen is an altruist, and Benjamin is an egoist>>>."
