  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by altruists and egoists. Altruists always tell the truth, and egoists always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Riley, and Avery. In Riley's words: \"Avery is an egoist and Avery is an altruist\". \"Riley is an egoist or Avery is an altruist,\" Avery claimed. So who is an altruist and who is an egoist? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Riley is a altruist/egoist, and Avery is a altruist/egoist>>>)",
  "response_list": [
    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Riley and Avery, keeping in mind the characteristics of altruists and egoists:\n\n1. **Riley's Statement: \"Avery is an egoist and Avery is an altruist.\"**\n   - This statement is a contradiction because a person cannot be both an egoist and an altruist simultaneously.\n   - If Riley were an altruist (truth-teller), this statement would have to be true, but it cannot be true because it is self-contradictory.\n   - Therefore, Riley cannot be an altruist. Riley must be an egoist (liar).\n\n2. **Avery's Statement: \"Riley is an egoist or Avery is an altruist.\"**\n   - This is a logical \"or\" statement, which means at least one of the conditions must be true for the statement to be true.\n   - We have already determined that Riley is an egoist. Therefore, the first part of the \"or\" statement (\"Riley is an egoist\") is true.\n   - Since the first part is true, the entire \"or\" statement is true regardless of the truth value of the second part (\"Avery is an altruist\").\n   - If Avery were an egoist, they would be lying, which means the statement would be false. However, the statement is true, so Avery cannot be an egoist.\n   - Therefore, Avery must be an altruist (truth-teller).\n\nBased on this analysis, we conclude:\n- Riley is an egoist.\n- Avery is an altruist.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Riley is an egoist, and Avery is an altruist>>>."
