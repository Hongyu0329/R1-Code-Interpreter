  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by angels and devils. Angels always tell the truth, and devils always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Daniel, and Ethan. According to Daniel, \"if Ethan is an angel then Ethan is a devil\". According to Ethan, \"Daniel is an angel if and only if Daniel is a devil\". So who is an angel and who is a devil? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Daniel is a angel/devil, and Ethan is a angel/devil>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Daniel and Ethan, keeping in mind that angels always tell the truth and devils always lie.\n\n1. **Analyze Daniel's Statement:**\n   - Daniel says, \"If Ethan is an angel, then Ethan is a devil.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement: If P, then Q, where P is \"Ethan is an angel\" and Q is \"Ethan is a devil.\"\n   - If Daniel is an angel (truth-teller), then the statement must be true. However, the statement \"If Ethan is an angel, then Ethan is a devil\" is a contradiction because an individual cannot be both an angel and a devil simultaneously. Therefore, Daniel cannot be an angel.\n   - If Daniel is a devil (liar), then the statement is false. The negation of \"If Ethan is an angel, then Ethan is a devil\" is \"Ethan is an angel and Ethan is not a devil,\" which is consistent because Ethan can be an angel. Thus, Daniel being a devil is consistent with his statement being false.\n\n2. **Analyze Ethan's Statement:**\n   - Ethan says, \"Daniel is an angel if and only if Daniel is a devil.\"\n   - This is a biconditional statement: Daniel is an angel â†” Daniel is a devil.\n   - If Ethan is an angel (truth-teller), then the statement must be true. However, the statement \"Daniel is an angel if and only if Daniel is a devil\" is a contradiction because Daniel cannot be both an angel and a devil simultaneously. Therefore, Ethan cannot be an angel.\n   - If Ethan is a devil (liar), then the statement is false. The negation of \"Daniel is an angel if and only if Daniel is a devil\" is \"Daniel is an angel or Daniel is not a devil,\" which is consistent because Daniel is a devil. Thus, Ethan being a devil is consistent with his statement being false.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Both analyses show that Daniel must be a devil and Ethan must be a devil. This is consistent with both of their statements being false, as devils always lie.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<Daniel is a devil, and Ethan is a devil>>>"
