  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by angels and devils. Angels always tell the truth, and devils always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Matthew, and Logan. In a statement by Matthew: \"Matthew is an angel and Logan is a devil\". \"Matthew is an angel\" - Logan. So who is an angel and who is a devil? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Matthew is a angel/devil, and Logan is a angel/devil>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Matthew and Logan, keeping in mind the characteristics of angels and devils:\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - Matthew says: \"Matthew is an angel and Logan is a devil.\"\n   - Logan says: \"Matthew is an angel.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing Matthew's Statement:**\n   - If Matthew is an angel, then his statement is true. This would mean:\n     - Matthew is indeed an angel.\n     - Logan is a devil.\n   - If Matthew is a devil, then his statement is false. This would mean:\n     - Matthew is not an angel (i.e., Matthew is a devil).\n     - Logan is not a devil (i.e., Logan is an angel).\n\n3. **Analyzing Logan's Statement:**\n   - If Logan is an angel, then his statement is true. This would mean:\n     - Matthew is an angel.\n   - If Logan is a devil, then his statement is false. This would mean:\n     - Matthew is not an angel (i.e., Matthew is a devil).\n\n4. **Cross-Referencing Both Statements:**\n   - Assume Matthew is an angel:\n     - Matthew's statement is true: Matthew is an angel, and Logan is a devil.\n     - Logan's statement would be false if Logan is a devil, which is consistent because devils lie.\n   - Assume Matthew is a devil:\n     - Matthew's statement is false: Matthew is a devil, and Logan is an angel.\n     - Logan's statement would be true if Logan is an angel, which is consistent because angels tell the truth.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - If Matthew is an angel, then Logan must be a devil, and both statements are consistent.\n   - If Matthew is a devil, then Logan must be an angel, and both statements are consistent.\n\nHowever, the only consistent scenario where both statements align with the nature of angels and devils is:\n- Matthew is an angel (telling the truth), and Logan is a devil (lying).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<Matthew is an angel, and Logan is a devil>>>"
