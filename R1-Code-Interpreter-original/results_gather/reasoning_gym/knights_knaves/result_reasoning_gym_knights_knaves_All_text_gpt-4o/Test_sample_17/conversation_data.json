  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by altruists and egoists. Altruists always tell the truth, and egoists always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Sophia, and Oliver. Sophia said that Sophia is an altruist if and only if Oliver is an egoist. Oliver noted, \"Sophia is an egoist if and only if Oliver is an altruist\". So who is an altruist and who is an egoist? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Sophia is a altruist/egoist, and Oliver is a altruist/egoist>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Sophia and Oliver and determine their truthfulness based on the characteristics of altruists and egoists.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - Sophia's statement: \"Sophia is an altruist if and only if Oliver is an egoist.\"\n   - Oliver's statement: \"Sophia is an egoist if and only if Oliver is an altruist.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing Sophia's Statement:**\n   - If Sophia is an altruist (truth-teller), her statement must be true. Therefore, Sophia being an altruist implies Oliver is an egoist.\n   - If Sophia is an egoist (liar), her statement must be false. Therefore, Sophia being an egoist implies Oliver is an altruist.\n\n3. **Analyzing Oliver's Statement:**\n   - If Oliver is an altruist (truth-teller), his statement must be true. Therefore, Sophia being an egoist implies Oliver is an altruist.\n   - If Oliver is an egoist (liar), his statement must be false. Therefore, Sophia being an egoist implies Oliver is not an altruist, i.e., Oliver is an egoist.\n\n4. **Evaluating Possible Scenarios:**\n   - **Scenario 1:** Sophia is an altruist.\n     - According to Sophia's statement, Oliver must be an egoist.\n     - Check Oliver's statement: If Oliver is an egoist, his statement is false. Therefore, Sophia is not an egoist, which is consistent with Sophia being an altruist.\n     - This scenario is consistent.\n\n   - **Scenario 2:** Sophia is an egoist.\n     - According to Sophia's statement, Oliver must be an altruist.\n     - Check Oliver's statement: If Oliver is an altruist, his statement is true. Therefore, Sophia must be an egoist, which is consistent with the assumption.\n     - This scenario is also consistent.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Both scenarios are logically consistent, but we need to determine which one is correct. Since both scenarios are possible, we need to find a contradiction or a definitive conclusion.\n   - Re-evaluating the statements, if Sophia is an altruist, Oliver must be an egoist, and if Sophia is an egoist, Oliver must be an altruist. Both scenarios are self-consistent, but they cannot both be true simultaneously.\n   - The key lies in the mutual exclusivity of the statements: if one is true, the other must be false. Therefore, the only consistent scenario is where Sophia is an altruist and Oliver is an egoist.\n\nThus, the final answer is: <<<Sophia is an altruist, and Oliver is an egoist>>>."
