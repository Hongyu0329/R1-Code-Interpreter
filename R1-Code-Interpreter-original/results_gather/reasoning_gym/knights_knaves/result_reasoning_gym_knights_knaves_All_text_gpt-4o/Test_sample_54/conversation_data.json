  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Owen, and Charlotte. According to Owen, \"Charlotte is a knave\". Charlotte asserted: \"if Charlotte is a knight then Owen is a knave\". So who is a knight and who is a knave? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Owen is a knight/knave, and Charlotte is a knight/knave>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Owen and Charlotte, considering the nature of knights and knaves.\n\n1. **Understanding the Characters:**\n   - Knights always tell the truth.\n   - Knaves always lie.\n\n2. **Statements:**\n   - Owen says, \"Charlotte is a knave.\"\n   - Charlotte says, \"If Charlotte is a knight, then Owen is a knave.\"\n\n3. **Analyzing Owen's Statement:**\n   - If Owen is a knight, his statement is true, which means Charlotte is a knave.\n   - If Owen is a knave, his statement is false, which means Charlotte is a knight.\n\n4. **Analyzing Charlotte's Statement:**\n   - Charlotte's statement is a conditional: \"If Charlotte is a knight, then Owen is a knave.\"\n   - If Charlotte is a knight, the statement must be true. Therefore, Owen must be a knave.\n   - If Charlotte is a knave, the statement is false. For a conditional statement to be false, the antecedent (Charlotte is a knight) must be true, and the consequent (Owen is a knave) must be false. This creates a contradiction because if Charlotte is a knave, she cannot be a knight.\n\n5. **Combining the Analyses:**\n   - Assume Owen is a knight:\n     - Owen's statement \"Charlotte is a knave\" is true.\n     - Therefore, Charlotte is a knave.\n     - Charlotte's statement \"If Charlotte is a knight, then Owen is a knave\" is irrelevant because Charlotte is not a knight.\n   - Assume Owen is a knave:\n     - Owen's statement \"Charlotte is a knave\" is false.\n     - Therefore, Charlotte is a knight.\n     - Charlotte's statement \"If Charlotte is a knight, then Owen is a knave\" must be true because Charlotte is a knight. Therefore, Owen must be a knave.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Both scenarios are consistent:\n     - If Owen is a knight, Charlotte is a knave.\n     - If Owen is a knave, Charlotte is a knight.\n\nThe only consistent scenario is that Owen is a knave and Charlotte is a knight.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n<<<Owen is a knave, and Charlotte is a knight>>>"
