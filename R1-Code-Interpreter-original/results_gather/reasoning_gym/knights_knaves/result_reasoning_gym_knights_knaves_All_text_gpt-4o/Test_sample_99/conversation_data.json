    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Elizabeth and Mason and determine who is a saint and who is a sinner. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Characters:**\n   - Saints always tell the truth.\n   - Sinners always lie.\n\n2. **Statements:**\n   - Elizabeth says, \"Mason is a sinner.\"\n   - Mason says, \"Elizabeth is a sinner and Elizabeth is a saint.\"\n\n3. **Analyzing Elizabeth's Statement:**\n   - If Elizabeth is a saint (truth-teller), then her statement \"Mason is a sinner\" is true. This would mean Mason is indeed a sinner.\n   - If Elizabeth is a sinner (liar), then her statement \"Mason is a sinner\" is false. This would mean Mason is a saint.\n\n4. **Analyzing Mason's Statement:**\n   - Mason says two things: \"Elizabeth is a sinner\" and \"Elizabeth is a saint.\"\n   - If Mason is a saint (truth-teller), both parts of his statement must be true. However, it is impossible for Elizabeth to be both a sinner and a saint simultaneously. Therefore, Mason cannot be a saint.\n   - If Mason is a sinner (liar), then at least one part of his statement must be false. Since he claims both \"Elizabeth is a sinner\" and \"Elizabeth is a saint,\" and these are contradictory, it confirms that Mason is lying.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Mason cannot be a saint (as his statement is contradictory), Mason must be a sinner.\n   - If Mason is a sinner, then Elizabeth's statement \"Mason is a sinner\" is true, which means Elizabeth is a saint.\n\nTherefore, the logical conclusion is:\n\n<<<Elizabeth is a saint, and Mason is a sinner>>>"
