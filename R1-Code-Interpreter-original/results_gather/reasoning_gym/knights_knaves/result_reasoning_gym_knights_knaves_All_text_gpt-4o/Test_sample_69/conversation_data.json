  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by angels and devils. Angels always tell the truth, and devils always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Emma, and Jackson. Emma said, \"Jackson is an angel if and only if Emma is an angel.\" Jackson remarked, \"Emma is an angel\". So who is an angel and who is a devil? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Emma is a angel/devil, and Jackson is a angel/devil>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Emma and Jackson, considering the nature of angels and devils on the island.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - Emma says, \"Jackson is an angel if and only if Emma is an angel.\"\n     - This is a biconditional statement, which means both parts must be true or both must be false.\n   - Jackson says, \"Emma is an angel.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing Emma's Statement:**\n   - If Emma is an angel (truth-teller), then her statement is true. This means:\n     - Jackson is an angel if and only if Emma is an angel.\n     - Since Emma is an angel, Jackson must also be an angel for the statement to hold true.\n   - If Emma is a devil (liar), then her statement is false. This means:\n     - Jackson is not an angel if and only if Emma is an angel.\n     - Since Emma is a devil, Jackson must be a devil for the statement to be false.\n\n3. **Analyzing Jackson's Statement:**\n   - If Jackson is an angel (truth-teller), then his statement is true. This means:\n     - Emma is an angel.\n   - If Jackson is a devil (liar), then his statement is false. This means:\n     - Emma is not an angel.\n\n4. **Combining the Analysis:**\n   - **Case 1: Emma is an angel.**\n     - Emma's statement is true: Jackson is an angel if and only if Emma is an angel.\n     - Jackson's statement is true: Emma is an angel.\n     - Both statements are consistent if both Emma and Jackson are angels.\n\n   - **Case 2: Emma is a devil.**\n     - Emma's statement is false: Jackson is not an angel if and only if Emma is an angel.\n     - Jackson's statement is false: Emma is not an angel.\n     - Both statements are consistent if both Emma and Jackson are devils.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only consistent scenario where both statements align with the nature of angels and devils is when both Emma and Jackson are angels. If Emma were a devil, Jackson's statement would contradict the nature of devils, as it would be true.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n<<<Emma is an angel, and Jackson is an angel>>>"
