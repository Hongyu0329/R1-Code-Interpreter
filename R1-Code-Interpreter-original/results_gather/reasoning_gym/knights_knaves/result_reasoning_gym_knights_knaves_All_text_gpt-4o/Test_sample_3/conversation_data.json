  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Daniel, and Lily. \"Daniel is a knight,\" Daniel mentioned. Lily was heard saying, \"if Lily is a knight then Daniel is a knight\". So who is a knight and who is a knave? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Daniel is a knight/knave, and Lily is a knight/knave>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Daniel and Lily, considering the nature of knights and knaves.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - Daniel says, \"Daniel is a knight.\"\n   - Lily says, \"If Lily is a knight, then Daniel is a knight.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing Daniel's Statement:**\n   - If Daniel is a knight, then his statement is true, meaning Daniel is indeed a knight.\n   - If Daniel is a knave, then his statement is false, meaning Daniel is not a knight.\n\n3. **Analyzing Lily's Statement:**\n   - Lily's statement is a conditional statement: \"If Lily is a knight, then Daniel is a knight.\"\n   - If Lily is a knight, her statement must be true. Therefore, Daniel must be a knight.\n   - If Lily is a knave, her statement is false. The negation of \"If Lily is a knight, then Daniel is a knight\" is \"Lily is a knight and Daniel is not a knight.\"\n\n4. **Considering Possible Scenarios:**\n\n   **Scenario 1: Daniel is a knight.**\n   - If Daniel is a knight, his statement is true.\n   - Lily's statement must also be true if she is a knight. If Lily is a knight, then Daniel is a knight, which is consistent.\n   - If Lily is a knave, her statement is false. The negation would be \"Lily is a knight and Daniel is not a knight,\" which is a contradiction because Daniel is a knight.\n\n   **Scenario 2: Daniel is a knave.**\n   - If Daniel is a knave, his statement is false, meaning Daniel is not a knight.\n   - Lily's statement must be false if she is a knave. The negation would be \"Lily is a knight and Daniel is not a knight,\" which is consistent because Daniel is not a knight.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - In Scenario 1, Daniel being a knight leads to a contradiction if Lily is a knave.\n   - In Scenario 2, Daniel being a knave is consistent with Lily being a knave.\n\nTherefore, the only consistent scenario is that both Daniel and Lily are knaves.\n\n<<<Daniel is a knave, and Lily is a knave>>>"
