  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by angels and devils. Angels always tell the truth, and devils always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Victoria, and Grace. According to Victoria, \"Victoria is an angel or Grace is an angel\". Grace noted, \"Grace is an angel if and only if Victoria is a devil\". So who is an angel and who is a devil? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Victoria is a angel/devil, and Grace is a angel/devil>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Victoria and Grace, considering the nature of angels and devils on the island.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - Victoria says, \"Victoria is an angel or Grace is an angel.\"\n   - Grace says, \"Grace is an angel if and only if Victoria is a devil.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing Victoria's Statement:**\n   - If Victoria is an angel, her statement must be true. Therefore, either Victoria is an angel, or Grace is an angel, or both.\n   - If Victoria is a devil, her statement must be false. Therefore, neither Victoria is an angel nor Grace is an angel.\n\n3. **Analyzing Grace's Statement:**\n   - Grace's statement is a biconditional: \"Grace is an angel if and only if Victoria is a devil.\"\n   - If Grace is an angel, then her statement is true, which means Victoria must be a devil.\n   - If Grace is a devil, then her statement is false, which means Grace is not an angel or Victoria is not a devil.\n\n4. **Case Analysis:**\n\n   **Case 1: Victoria is an angel.**\n   - Victoria's statement is true, so either Victoria is an angel or Grace is an angel, or both.\n   - Grace's statement must be false (since she is a devil), which means Grace is not an angel or Victoria is not a devil. Since Victoria is an angel, Grace must be a devil.\n\n   **Case 2: Victoria is a devil.**\n   - Victoria's statement is false, so neither Victoria is an angel nor Grace is an angel.\n   - Grace's statement must be true (since she is an angel), which means Victoria is a devil. This is consistent with our assumption that Victoria is a devil.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - In Case 1, Victoria is an angel and Grace is a devil.\n   - In Case 2, Victoria is a devil and Grace is an angel.\n\nHowever, Case 2 leads to a contradiction because if Victoria is a devil, then Grace's statement being true would imply Grace is an angel, which contradicts Victoria's false statement that neither is an angel. Therefore, Case 2 is not possible.\n\nThus, the only consistent scenario is Case 1.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n<<<Victoria is an angel, and Grace is a devil>>>"
