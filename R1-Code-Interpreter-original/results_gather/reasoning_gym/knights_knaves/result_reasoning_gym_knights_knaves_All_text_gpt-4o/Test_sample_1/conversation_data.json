  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by saints and sinners. Saints always tell the truth, and sinners always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Elizabeth, and Ethan. \"Ethan is a sinner,\" Elizabeth declared. Ethan expressed that if Ethan is a saint then Elizabeth is a sinner. So who is a saint and who is a sinner? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Elizabeth is a saint/sinner, and Ethan is a saint/sinner>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Elizabeth and Ethan and determine their truthfulness based on the characteristics of saints and sinners.\n\n1. **Understanding the Characters:**\n   - Saints always tell the truth.\n   - Sinners always lie.\n\n2. **Statements:**\n   - Elizabeth says, \"Ethan is a sinner.\"\n   - Ethan says, \"If Ethan is a saint, then Elizabeth is a sinner.\"\n\n3. **Analyzing Elizabeth's Statement:**\n   - If Elizabeth is a saint, her statement \"Ethan is a sinner\" must be true. Therefore, Ethan would be a sinner.\n   - If Elizabeth is a sinner, her statement \"Ethan is a sinner\" must be false. Therefore, Ethan would be a saint.\n\n4. **Analyzing Ethan's Statement:**\n   - Ethan's statement is a conditional statement: \"If Ethan is a saint, then Elizabeth is a sinner.\"\n   - If Ethan is a saint, the statement must be true. Therefore, Elizabeth would indeed be a sinner.\n   - If Ethan is a sinner, the statement must be false. This means that the condition \"Ethan is a saint\" is false, which is consistent because Ethan is a sinner.\n\n5. **Combining the Analysis:**\n   - Assume Elizabeth is a saint:\n     - Her statement \"Ethan is a sinner\" is true, so Ethan is a sinner.\n     - Ethan's statement, being a sinner, is false, which is consistent because the condition \"Ethan is a saint\" is false.\n   - Assume Elizabeth is a sinner:\n     - Her statement \"Ethan is a sinner\" is false, so Ethan is a saint.\n     - Ethan's statement, being a saint, is true, which means Elizabeth is a sinner.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Both scenarios are consistent with the given statements and characteristics of saints and sinners.\n   - However, the scenario where Elizabeth is a saint and Ethan is a sinner is more straightforward and consistent with both statements.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: <<<Elizabeth is a saint, and Ethan is a sinner>>>."
