  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by altruists and egoists. Altruists always tell the truth, and egoists always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Sebastian, and Ethan. Sebastian remarked, \"if Sebastian is an altruist then Ethan is an egoist\". In Ethan's words: \"Sebastian is an egoist\". So who is an altruist and who is an egoist? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Sebastian is a altruist/egoist, and Ethan is a altruist/egoist>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Sebastian and Ethan, considering the nature of altruists and egoists on the island.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - Sebastian says: \"If Sebastian is an altruist, then Ethan is an egoist.\"\n   - Ethan says: \"Sebastian is an egoist.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing Sebastian's Statement:**\n   - If Sebastian is an altruist (truth-teller), then his statement must be true. Therefore, if Sebastian is an altruist, Ethan must be an egoist.\n   - If Sebastian is an egoist (liar), then his statement is false. This means that if Sebastian is an altruist, Ethan is not an egoist, implying Ethan is an altruist.\n\n3. **Analyzing Ethan's Statement:**\n   - If Ethan is an altruist (truth-teller), then his statement \"Sebastian is an egoist\" must be true. Therefore, Sebastian is an egoist.\n   - If Ethan is an egoist (liar), then his statement is false, meaning Sebastian is not an egoist, implying Sebastian is an altruist.\n\n4. **Combining the Analysis:**\n   - Assume Sebastian is an altruist:\n     - According to his statement, Ethan must be an egoist.\n     - Ethan, being an egoist, would lie, so his statement \"Sebastian is an egoist\" is false, which is consistent with Sebastian being an altruist.\n   - Assume Sebastian is an egoist:\n     - His statement \"If Sebastian is an altruist, then Ethan is an egoist\" is false. This means if Sebastian were an altruist, Ethan would be an altruist.\n     - Ethan's statement \"Sebastian is an egoist\" would be true if Ethan were an altruist, which contradicts the assumption that Sebastian is an egoist.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only consistent scenario is that Sebastian is an altruist and Ethan is an egoist. This satisfies both statements: Sebastian's statement is true, and Ethan's statement is false.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<Sebastian is an altruist, and Ethan is an egoist>>>."
