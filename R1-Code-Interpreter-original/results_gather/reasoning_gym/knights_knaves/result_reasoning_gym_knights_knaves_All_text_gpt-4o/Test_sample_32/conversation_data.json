  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by angels and devils. Angels always tell the truth, and devils always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Mia, and Lily. \"Lily is a devil,\" Mia mentioned. Lily told you that Mia is a devil or Mia is an angel. So who is an angel and who is a devil? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Mia is a angel/devil, and Lily is a angel/devil>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Mia and Lily, keeping in mind the characteristics of angels and devils:\n\n1. **Mia's Statement**: \"Lily is a devil.\"\n   - If Mia is an angel (truth-teller), then her statement is true, and Lily must be a devil.\n   - If Mia is a devil (liar), then her statement is false, and Lily must be an angel.\n\n2. **Lily's Statement**: \"Mia is a devil or Mia is an angel.\"\n   - This statement is logically always true because it covers all possibilities (Mia being either a devil or an angel). However, we need to consider the context of the island:\n     - If Lily is an angel (truth-teller), her statement is true, but it doesn't provide new information since it's a tautology.\n     - If Lily is a devil (liar), her statement must be false. However, since the statement is a tautology, it cannot be false, which means Lily cannot be a devil.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1**: Assume Mia is an angel.\n  - Mia's statement \"Lily is a devil\" would be true.\n  - Therefore, Lily must be a devil.\n  - However, if Lily is a devil, her statement \"Mia is a devil or Mia is an angel\" would be false, which is impossible because it's a tautology.\n  - Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\n- **Scenario 2**: Assume Mia is a devil.\n  - Mia's statement \"Lily is a devil\" would be false.\n  - Therefore, Lily must be an angel.\n  - If Lily is an angel, her statement \"Mia is a devil or Mia is an angel\" is true, which is consistent with her being an angel.\n\nSince Scenario 1 leads to a contradiction and Scenario 2 is consistent, the only possible solution is:\n\n<<<Mia is a devil, and Lily is an angel>>>"
