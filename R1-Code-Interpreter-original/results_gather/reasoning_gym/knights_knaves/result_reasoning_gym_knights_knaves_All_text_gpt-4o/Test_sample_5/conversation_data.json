  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by heros and villains. Heros always tell the truth, and villains always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Henry, and Ethan. According to Henry, \"Henry is a hero if and only if Ethan is a hero\". \"Henry is a villain,\" Ethan claimed. So who is a hero and who is a villain? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Henry is a hero/villain, and Ethan is a hero/villain>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Henry and Ethan and determine their truthfulness based on the nature of heros and villains.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - Henry says: \"Henry is a hero if and only if Ethan is a hero.\"\n   - Ethan says: \"Henry is a villain.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing Henry's Statement:**\n   - The statement \"Henry is a hero if and only if Ethan is a hero\" is a biconditional statement. This means both parts of the statement must have the same truth value for the entire statement to be true.\n   - If Henry is a hero, then his statement must be true. Therefore, Ethan must also be a hero.\n   - If Henry is a villain, then his statement must be false. Therefore, Ethan must be a villain.\n\n3. **Analyzing Ethan's Statement:**\n   - Ethan claims, \"Henry is a villain.\"\n   - If Ethan is a hero, then his statement is true, meaning Henry is indeed a villain.\n   - If Ethan is a villain, then his statement is false, meaning Henry is not a villain (i.e., Henry is a hero).\n\n4. **Considering the Possibilities:**\n   - **Case 1: Henry is a hero.**\n     - If Henry is a hero, his statement is true, so Ethan must also be a hero.\n     - However, if Ethan is a hero, his statement \"Henry is a villain\" would be false, which is a contradiction.\n     - Therefore, Henry cannot be a hero.\n\n   - **Case 2: Henry is a villain.**\n     - If Henry is a villain, his statement is false, so Ethan must be a villain.\n     - If Ethan is a villain, his statement \"Henry is a villain\" is false, meaning Henry is not a villain (i.e., Henry is a hero), which is a contradiction.\n     - Therefore, this case also seems contradictory.\n\n5. **Re-evaluating the Contradictions:**\n   - Let's re-evaluate the contradictions:\n     - If Henry is a villain, his statement is false, so Ethan must be a villain.\n     - If Ethan is a villain, his statement \"Henry is a villain\" is false, meaning Henry is not a villain (i.e., Henry is a hero).\n     - This contradiction arises because we assumed Henry is a villain, but the logic leads us back to Henry being a hero.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only consistent scenario is that Henry is a hero and Ethan is a villain.\n   - This satisfies all conditions: Henry's statement is true (both are heroes, which is not the case, so the statement is false, consistent with Henry being a hero), and Ethan's statement is false (consistent with Ethan being a villain).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: <<<Henry is a hero, and Ethan is a villain>>>."
