  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by altruists and egoists. Altruists always tell the truth, and egoists always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Riley, and Lily. Riley commented, \"Riley is an altruist if and only if Lily is an altruist\". In Lily's words: \"Riley is an egoist\". So who is an altruist and who is an egoist? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Riley is a altruist/egoist, and Lily is a altruist/egoist>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Riley and Lily, considering the nature of altruists and egoists on the island.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - Riley says: \"Riley is an altruist if and only if Lily is an altruist.\"\n   - Lily says: \"Riley is an egoist.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing Riley's Statement:**\n   - Riley's statement is a biconditional statement, which means it is true if both parts are true or both parts are false.\n   - If Riley is an altruist (truth-teller), then the statement must be true. This implies that both Riley and Lily are altruists.\n   - If Riley is an egoist (liar), then the statement must be false. This implies that one is an altruist and the other is an egoist.\n\n3. **Analyzing Lily's Statement:**\n   - If Lily is an altruist, then her statement \"Riley is an egoist\" must be true, meaning Riley is indeed an egoist.\n   - If Lily is an egoist, then her statement \"Riley is an egoist\" must be false, meaning Riley is an altruist.\n\n4. **Combining the Analysis:**\n   - Assume Riley is an altruist:\n     - Riley's statement is true, so both Riley and Lily are altruists.\n     - However, this contradicts Lily's statement that Riley is an egoist.\n   - Therefore, Riley cannot be an altruist.\n\n5. **Conclusion from Riley being an Egoist:**\n   - If Riley is an egoist, his statement is false. This means that it is not the case that both are altruists or both are egoists.\n   - Since Riley is an egoist, Lily must be an altruist to satisfy the falsehood of Riley's statement.\n   - Lily being an altruist makes her statement true, confirming that Riley is indeed an egoist.\n\nThus, the logical conclusion is that Riley is an egoist and Lily is an altruist.\n\n<<<Riley is an egoist, and Lily is an altruist>>>"
