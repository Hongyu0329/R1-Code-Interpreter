  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by heros and villains. Heros always tell the truth, and villains always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Benjamin, and Scarlett. Benjamin was heard saying, \"if Benjamin is a hero then Scarlett is a hero\". Scarlett stated, \"Scarlett is a hero or Benjamin is a hero\". So who is a hero and who is a villain? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Benjamin is a hero/villain, and Scarlett is a hero/villain>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Benjamin and Scarlett, considering the nature of heros and villains on the island.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - Benjamin says: \"If Benjamin is a hero, then Scarlett is a hero.\"\n   - Scarlett says: \"Scarlett is a hero or Benjamin is a hero.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing Benjamin's Statement:**\n   - If Benjamin is a hero, then his statement must be true. Therefore, if Benjamin is a hero, Scarlett must also be a hero.\n   - If Benjamin is a villain, then his statement is false. The statement \"If Benjamin is a hero, then Scarlett is a hero\" being false means that Benjamin is a hero and Scarlett is not a hero (i.e., Scarlett is a villain).\n\n3. **Analyzing Scarlett's Statement:**\n   - If Scarlett is a hero, then her statement must be true. Therefore, either Scarlett is a hero or Benjamin is a hero (or both).\n   - If Scarlett is a villain, then her statement is false. This means neither Scarlett is a hero nor Benjamin is a hero, implying both are villains.\n\n4. **Combining the Analysis:**\n   - Assume Benjamin is a hero:\n     - Then Scarlett must be a hero (from Benjamin's statement).\n     - Scarlett's statement \"Scarlett is a hero or Benjamin is a hero\" is true, which is consistent because Scarlett is a hero.\n   - Assume Benjamin is a villain:\n     - Then Benjamin's statement is false, meaning Benjamin is a hero and Scarlett is a villain, which is a contradiction because Benjamin cannot be both a hero and a villain.\n   - Assume Scarlett is a hero:\n     - Then her statement is true, meaning either Scarlett is a hero or Benjamin is a hero, which is consistent.\n     - From Benjamin's statement, if Benjamin is a hero, Scarlett must be a hero, which is consistent.\n   - Assume Scarlett is a villain:\n     - Then her statement is false, meaning neither Scarlett is a hero nor Benjamin is a hero, which is a contradiction because Scarlett cannot be both a hero and a villain.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only consistent scenario is when both Benjamin and Scarlett are heros. This satisfies both of their statements without contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<Benjamin is a hero, and Scarlett is a hero>>>."
