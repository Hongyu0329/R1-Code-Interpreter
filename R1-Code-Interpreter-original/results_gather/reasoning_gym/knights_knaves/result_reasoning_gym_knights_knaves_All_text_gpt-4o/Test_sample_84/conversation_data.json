  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by sages and fools. Sages always tell the truth, and fools always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Victoria, and Grace. In a statement by Victoria: \"if Victoria is a sage then Grace is a fool\". Grace remarked, \"Victoria is a sage and Grace is a sage\". So who is a sage and who is a fool? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Victoria is a sage/fool, and Grace is a sage/fool>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Victoria and Grace, considering the nature of sages and fools on the island.\n\n1. **Understanding the Characters:**\n   - Sages always tell the truth.\n   - Fools always lie.\n\n2. **Analyzing Victoria's Statement:**\n   - Victoria says, \"If Victoria is a sage, then Grace is a fool.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement: If P, then Q, where P is \"Victoria is a sage\" and Q is \"Grace is a fool.\"\n\n3. **Analyzing Grace's Statement:**\n   - Grace says, \"Victoria is a sage and Grace is a sage.\"\n   - This is a conjunction: P and Q, where P is \"Victoria is a sage\" and Q is \"Grace is a sage.\"\n\n4. **Case Analysis:**\n\n   **Case 1: Assume Victoria is a sage.**\n   - If Victoria is a sage, her statement must be true.\n   - Therefore, \"If Victoria is a sage, then Grace is a fool\" must be true.\n   - Since Victoria is a sage, the condition is satisfied, and the conclusion \"Grace is a fool\" must be true.\n   - Grace's statement \"Victoria is a sage and Grace is a sage\" would then be false because Grace is a fool.\n   - This is consistent because a fool would lie.\n\n   **Case 2: Assume Victoria is a fool.**\n   - If Victoria is a fool, her statement must be false.\n   - The statement \"If Victoria is a sage, then Grace is a fool\" being false implies that Victoria is a sage and Grace is not a fool (i.e., Grace is a sage).\n   - This creates a contradiction because if Victoria is a fool, she cannot also be a sage.\n   - Therefore, this case is not possible.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only consistent scenario is Case 1, where Victoria is a sage and Grace is a fool.\n\nThus, the answer is: <<<Victoria is a sage, and Grace is a fool>>>."
