  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by saints and sinners. Saints always tell the truth, and sinners always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Joseph, and Lily. In Joseph's words: \"if Joseph is a saint then Lily is a sinner\". Lily stated, \"Joseph is a sinner\". So who is a saint and who is a sinner? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Joseph is a saint/sinner, and Lily is a saint/sinner>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Joseph and Lily, considering the nature of saints and sinners.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - Joseph says: \"If Joseph is a saint, then Lily is a sinner.\"\n   - Lily says: \"Joseph is a sinner.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing Joseph's Statement:**\n   - Joseph's statement is a conditional statement: \"If Joseph is a saint, then Lily is a sinner.\"\n   - If Joseph is a saint, he tells the truth. Therefore, the statement \"If Joseph is a saint, then Lily is a sinner\" must be true. This implies that Lily must be a sinner.\n   - If Joseph is a sinner, he lies. Therefore, the statement \"If Joseph is a saint, then Lily is a sinner\" is false. This means that Joseph being a saint does not necessarily imply Lily is a sinner, which means Lily could be a saint.\n\n3. **Analyzing Lily's Statement:**\n   - Lily says: \"Joseph is a sinner.\"\n   - If Lily is a saint, she tells the truth. Therefore, Joseph must be a sinner.\n   - If Lily is a sinner, she lies. Therefore, Joseph must be a saint.\n\n4. **Combining Both Analyses:**\n   - Assume Joseph is a saint:\n     - Joseph's statement \"If Joseph is a saint, then Lily is a sinner\" is true, so Lily must be a sinner.\n     - Lily, being a sinner, lies when she says \"Joseph is a sinner,\" which is consistent because Joseph is actually a saint.\n   - Assume Joseph is a sinner:\n     - Joseph's statement \"If Joseph is a saint, then Lily is a sinner\" is false, so Lily could be a saint.\n     - Lily, being a saint, tells the truth when she says \"Joseph is a sinner,\" which is consistent because Joseph is actually a sinner.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Both scenarios are consistent with the statements made by Joseph and Lily. However, the scenario where Joseph is a sinner and Lily is a saint is the only one that satisfies both statements without contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: <<<Joseph is a sinner, and Lily is a saint>>>."
