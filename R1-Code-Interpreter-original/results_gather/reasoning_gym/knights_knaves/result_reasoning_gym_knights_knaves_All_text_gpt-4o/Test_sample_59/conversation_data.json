  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by heros and villains. Heros always tell the truth, and villains always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Avery, and Aiden. \"Avery is a hero,\" Avery mentioned. Aiden expressed that if Aiden is a hero then Avery is a hero. So who is a hero and who is a villain? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Avery is a hero/villain, and Aiden is a hero/villain>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Avery and Aiden, considering the nature of heros and villains on the island.\n\n1. **Avery's Statement: \"Avery is a hero.\"**\n   - If Avery is a hero, then the statement is true, meaning Avery is indeed a hero.\n   - If Avery is a villain, then the statement is false, meaning Avery is not a hero.\n\n2. **Aiden's Statement: \"If Aiden is a hero then Avery is a hero.\"**\n   - This is a conditional statement. Let's analyze it:\n     - If Aiden is a hero, then the statement must be true (since heros always tell the truth). Therefore, Avery must be a hero for the statement to hold true.\n     - If Aiden is a villain, then the statement is false (since villains always lie). For the statement \"If Aiden is a hero then Avery is a hero\" to be false, Aiden must be a hero and Avery must not be a hero. However, this creates a contradiction because if Aiden is a villain, he cannot be a hero.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1: Avery is a hero.**\n  - Avery's statement \"Avery is a hero\" is true.\n  - Aiden's statement \"If Aiden is a hero then Avery is a hero\" must also be true.\n    - If Aiden is a hero, then Avery is a hero, which is consistent.\n    - If Aiden is a villain, the statement is false, which is consistent because villains lie.\n\n- **Scenario 2: Avery is a villain.**\n  - Avery's statement \"Avery is a hero\" is false.\n  - Aiden's statement \"If Aiden is a hero then Avery is a hero\" must be false.\n    - If Aiden is a hero, then Avery must not be a hero, which is consistent.\n    - If Aiden is a villain, the statement is false, which is consistent because villains lie.\n\nFrom the analysis, Scenario 1 is consistent without contradictions. In Scenario 2, Aiden being a hero and Avery being a villain is consistent, but it contradicts the nature of Aiden's statement being false if he is a hero. Therefore, Scenario 1 is the only consistent scenario.\n\nThus, the conclusion is:\n- Avery is a hero.\n- Aiden is a villain.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Avery is a hero, and Aiden is a villain>>>"
