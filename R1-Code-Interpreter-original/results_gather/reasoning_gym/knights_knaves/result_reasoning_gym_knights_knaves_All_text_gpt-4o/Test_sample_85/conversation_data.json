  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by altruists and egoists. Altruists always tell the truth, and egoists always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Ava, and Victoria. \"Victoria is an altruist if and only if Ava is an altruist,\" Ava declared. Victoria noted, \"Ava is an egoist\". So who is an altruist and who is an egoist? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Ava is a altruist/egoist, and Victoria is a altruist/egoist>>>)",
  "response_list": [
    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Ava and Victoria, considering the nature of altruists and egoists.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - Ava says: \"Victoria is an altruist if and only if Ava is an altruist.\"\n   - Victoria says: \"Ava is an egoist.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing Ava's Statement:**\n   - Ava's statement is a biconditional statement, which means both parts must be true or both must be false.\n   - If Ava is an altruist (truth-teller), then her statement is true. This means:\n     - If Ava is an altruist, then Victoria must also be an altruist.\n     - If Ava is an egoist, then Victoria must also be an egoist.\n   - If Ava is an egoist (liar), then her statement is false. This means:\n     - If Ava is an altruist, then Victoria is not an altruist.\n     - If Ava is an egoist, then Victoria is not an egoist.\n\n3. **Analyzing Victoria's Statement:**\n   - Victoria says, \"Ava is an egoist.\"\n   - If Victoria is an altruist, then her statement is true, meaning Ava is indeed an egoist.\n   - If Victoria is an egoist, then her statement is false, meaning Ava is not an egoist (i.e., Ava is an altruist).\n\n4. **Considering the Scenarios:**\n   - **Scenario 1:** Assume Ava is an altruist.\n     - Ava's statement is true, so Victoria must also be an altruist.\n     - But if Victoria is an altruist, her statement \"Ava is an egoist\" would be false, which contradicts our assumption that Ava is an altruist.\n   - **Scenario 2:** Assume Ava is an egoist.\n     - Ava's statement is false, so the opposite of her statement is true: Victoria is not an altruist.\n     - This means Victoria is an egoist.\n     - If Victoria is an egoist, her statement \"Ava is an egoist\" is false, which means Ava is not an egoist (i.e., Ava is an altruist).\n     - This creates a contradiction because we assumed Ava is an egoist.\n\n5. **Resolving the Contradiction:**\n   - The contradiction in Scenario 2 suggests that our assumption that Ava is an egoist is incorrect.\n   - Therefore, Ava must be an altruist, and Victoria must be an egoist.\n\nThus, the final answer is: <<<Ava is an altruist, and Victoria is an egoist>>>."
