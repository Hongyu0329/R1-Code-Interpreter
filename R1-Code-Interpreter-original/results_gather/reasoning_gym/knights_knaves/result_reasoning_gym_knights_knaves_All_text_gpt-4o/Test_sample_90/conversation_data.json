  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by sages and fools. Sages always tell the truth, and fools always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Evelyn, and Mia. Evelyn expressed that Mia is a sage and Mia is a fool. \"Evelyn is a sage or Evelyn is a fool\" - Mia. So who is a sage and who is a fool? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Evelyn is a sage/fool, and Mia is a sage/fool>>>)",
  "response_list": [
    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Evelyn and Mia, considering the nature of sages and fools on the island.\n\n1. **Evelyn's Statement:**\n   - Evelyn says, \"Mia is a sage and Mia is a fool.\"\n   - This statement is a contradiction because Mia cannot be both a sage and a fool simultaneously.\n   - If Evelyn were a sage, she would always tell the truth, and her statement would not be contradictory. Therefore, Evelyn cannot be a sage.\n   - Since Evelyn's statement is contradictory, Evelyn must be a fool (because fools always lie).\n\n2. **Mia's Statement:**\n   - Mia says, \"Evelyn is a sage or Evelyn is a fool.\"\n   - This statement is a logical tautology because it covers all possibilities: either Evelyn is a sage, or Evelyn is a fool.\n   - If Mia were a fool, she would lie, but since her statement is always true, Mia cannot be a fool.\n   - Therefore, Mia must be a sage (because sages always tell the truth).\n\nBased on the analysis of their statements:\n\n- Evelyn is a fool because her statement is contradictory and false.\n- Mia is a sage because her statement is a tautology and true.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Evelyn is a fool, and Mia is a sage>>>"
