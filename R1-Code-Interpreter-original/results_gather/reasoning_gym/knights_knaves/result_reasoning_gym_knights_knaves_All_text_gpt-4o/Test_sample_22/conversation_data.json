  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by sages and fools. Sages always tell the truth, and fools always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Jacob, and Emma. Jacob noted, \"Emma is a sage if and only if Emma is a fool\". \"Jacob is a sage if and only if Jacob is a fool,\" Emma claimed. So who is a sage and who is a fool? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Jacob is a sage/fool, and Emma is a sage/fool>>>)",
  "response_list": [
    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Jacob and Emma, keeping in mind the characteristics of sages and fools:\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - Jacob says, \"Emma is a sage if and only if Emma is a fool.\"\n   - Emma says, \"Jacob is a sage if and only if Jacob is a fool.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing Jacob's Statement:**\n   - The statement \"Emma is a sage if and only if Emma is a fool\" is a contradiction because someone cannot be both a sage and a fool simultaneously. Therefore, Jacob's statement is inherently false.\n   - Since Jacob's statement is false, Jacob must be a fool (because fools always lie).\n\n3. **Analyzing Emma's Statement:**\n   - Emma says, \"Jacob is a sage if and only if Jacob is a fool.\"\n   - This statement is also a contradiction because Jacob cannot be both a sage and a fool at the same time. Therefore, Emma's statement is also false.\n   - Since Emma's statement is false, Emma must be a fool (because fools always lie).\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Both Jacob and Emma made false statements, which means both of them are fools.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: <<<Jacob is a fool, and Emma is a fool>>>."
