  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by saints and sinners. Saints always tell the truth, and sinners always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Matthew, and David. Matthew commented, \"Matthew is a saint if and only if David is a saint\". As David put it, \"if Matthew is a saint then Matthew is a sinner\". So who is a saint and who is a sinner? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Matthew is a saint/sinner, and David is a saint/sinner>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Matthew and David, considering the nature of saints and sinners on the island.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - Matthew says: \"Matthew is a saint if and only if David is a saint.\"\n     - This is a biconditional statement, which means both parts must be true or both must be false.\n   - David says: \"If Matthew is a saint then Matthew is a sinner.\"\n     - This is a conditional statement, which is logically equivalent to saying \"Matthew is not a saint.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing Matthew's Statement:**\n   - If Matthew is a saint, his statement must be true. Therefore, David must also be a saint.\n   - If Matthew is a sinner, his statement must be false. Therefore, David must be a sinner.\n\n3. **Analyzing David's Statement:**\n   - If David is a saint, his statement must be true. Therefore, Matthew cannot be a saint (since the statement \"If Matthew is a saint then Matthew is a sinner\" would be true only if Matthew is not a saint).\n   - If David is a sinner, his statement must be false. Therefore, Matthew must be a saint (since the falsehood of \"If Matthew is a saint then Matthew is a sinner\" implies Matthew is indeed a saint).\n\n4. **Combining the Analysis:**\n   - Assume Matthew is a saint:\n     - Matthew's statement is true, so David must be a saint.\n     - But if David is a saint, his statement must be true, which implies Matthew is not a saint. This is a contradiction.\n   - Therefore, Matthew cannot be a saint.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Matthew cannot be a saint, he must be a sinner.\n   - If Matthew is a sinner, his statement is false, meaning David is not a saint (David is a sinner).\n   - David's statement, being from a sinner, is false, which is consistent with Matthew being a saint, but since we already concluded Matthew is a sinner, this confirms David is also a sinner.\n\nThus, both Matthew and David are sinners.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Matthew is a sinner, and David is a sinner>>>."
