  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by heros and villains. Heros always tell the truth, and villains always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: David, and Olivia. According to David, \"Olivia is a villain\". Olivia was heard saying, \"Olivia is a hero and David is a hero\". So who is a hero and who is a villain? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<David is a hero/villain, and Olivia is a hero/villain>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by David and Olivia, keeping in mind that heroes always tell the truth and villains always lie.\n\n1. **David's Statement: \"Olivia is a villain.\"**\n   - If David is a hero, then his statement is true, which means Olivia is indeed a villain.\n   - If David is a villain, then his statement is false, which means Olivia is not a villain (i.e., Olivia is a hero).\n\n2. **Olivia's Statement: \"Olivia is a hero and David is a hero.\"**\n   - If Olivia is a hero, then her statement is true, which means both Olivia and David are heroes.\n   - If Olivia is a villain, then her statement is false. This means at least one part of her statement is false. Therefore, either Olivia is not a hero (which is true if she is a villain) or David is not a hero (which means David is a villain).\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1: David is a hero.**\n  - If David is a hero, his statement \"Olivia is a villain\" is true. Therefore, Olivia is a villain.\n  - If Olivia is a villain, her statement \"Olivia is a hero and David is a hero\" is false, which is consistent because she is lying.\n\n- **Scenario 2: David is a villain.**\n  - If David is a villain, his statement \"Olivia is a villain\" is false. Therefore, Olivia is a hero.\n  - If Olivia is a hero, her statement \"Olivia is a hero and David is a hero\" must be true. However, this creates a contradiction because David cannot be a hero if he is a villain.\n\nFrom the analysis, Scenario 2 leads to a contradiction, so it cannot be true. Therefore, Scenario 1 must be correct.\n\nThus, the conclusion is:\n- David is a hero.\n- Olivia is a villain.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<David is a hero, and Olivia is a villain>>>."
