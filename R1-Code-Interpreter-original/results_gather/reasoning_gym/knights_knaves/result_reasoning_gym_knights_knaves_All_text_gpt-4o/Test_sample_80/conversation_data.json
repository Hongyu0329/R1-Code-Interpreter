  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Jackson, and Mason. In Jackson's words: \"Jackson is a knight or Mason is a knave\". \"Jackson is a knave if and only if Jackson is a knight,\" Mason declared. So who is a knight and who is a knave? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Jackson is a knight/knave, and Mason is a knight/knave>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Jackson and Mason, considering the nature of knights and knaves.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - Jackson says: \"Jackson is a knight or Mason is a knave.\"\n   - Mason says: \"Jackson is a knave if and only if Jackson is a knight.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing Jackson's Statement:**\n   - Jackson's statement is a disjunction: \"Jackson is a knight OR Mason is a knave.\"\n   - If Jackson is a knight, his statement must be true. Therefore, either Jackson is a knight (which is true by assumption) or Mason is a knave.\n   - If Jackson is a knave, his statement must be false. Therefore, neither Jackson is a knight (which is true by assumption) nor Mason is a knave, meaning Mason must be a knight.\n\n3. **Analyzing Mason's Statement:**\n   - Mason's statement is a biconditional: \"Jackson is a knave IF AND ONLY IF Jackson is a knight.\"\n   - This statement can be broken down into two parts:\n     - If Jackson is a knave, then Jackson is a knight.\n     - If Jackson is a knight, then Jackson is a knave.\n   - Both parts of this statement cannot be true simultaneously because they create a contradiction (a person cannot be both a knight and a knave at the same time).\n\n4. **Evaluating the Scenarios:**\n   - **Scenario 1:** Assume Jackson is a knight.\n     - Jackson's statement: \"Jackson is a knight or Mason is a knave\" is true.\n     - Mason's statement: \"Jackson is a knave if and only if Jackson is a knight\" is false because it creates a contradiction.\n     - Therefore, Mason must be a knave (since he made a false statement).\n\n   - **Scenario 2:** Assume Jackson is a knave.\n     - Jackson's statement: \"Jackson is a knight or Mason is a knave\" is false.\n     - Mason's statement: \"Jackson is a knave if and only if Jackson is a knight\" is true because both parts of the biconditional are false (Jackson is a knave, but not a knight).\n     - Therefore, Mason must be a knight (since he made a true statement).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - In both scenarios, we find that Jackson is a knave and Mason is a knight.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: <<<Jackson is a knave, and Mason is a knight>>>."
