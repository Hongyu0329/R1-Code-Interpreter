  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by sages and fools. Sages always tell the truth, and fools always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: David, and Jacob. David said that Jacob is a fool if and only if Jacob is a sage. Jacob stated, \"David is a fool\". So who is a sage and who is a fool? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<David is a sage/fool, and Jacob is a sage/fool>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by David and Jacob, considering the nature of sages and fools on the island.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - **David's Statement:** \"Jacob is a fool if and only if Jacob is a sage.\"\n     - This is a logical equivalence statement, which can be broken down into two parts:\n       - If Jacob is a fool, then Jacob is a sage.\n       - If Jacob is a sage, then Jacob is a fool.\n     - This statement is a contradiction because it implies that Jacob cannot be consistently one or the other.\n\n2. **Analyzing David's Statement:**\n   - If David is a sage (tells the truth), then his statement must be true. However, the statement \"Jacob is a fool if and only if Jacob is a sage\" is inherently false because it is a contradiction. Therefore, David cannot be a sage.\n   - If David is a fool (lies), then his statement must be false. Since the statement is a contradiction, it is indeed false. Therefore, David being a fool is consistent with his statement being false.\n\n3. **Analyzing Jacob's Statement:**\n   - Jacob stated, \"David is a fool.\"\n   - If Jacob is a sage (tells the truth), then his statement must be true, meaning David is indeed a fool.\n   - If Jacob is a fool (lies), then his statement must be false, meaning David is not a fool, which contradicts our earlier conclusion that David is a fool.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only consistent scenario is that David is a fool (since his statement is a contradiction and must be false), and Jacob is a sage (since his statement that David is a fool is true).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: <<<David is a fool, and Jacob is a sage>>>."
