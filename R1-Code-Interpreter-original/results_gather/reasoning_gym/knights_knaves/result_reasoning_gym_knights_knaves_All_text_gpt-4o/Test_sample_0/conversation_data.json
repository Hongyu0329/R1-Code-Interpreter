  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by saints and sinners. Saints always tell the truth, and sinners always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Scarlett, and Victoria. Scarlett noted, \"Victoria is a sinner if and only if Scarlett is a saint\". \"Victoria is a saint or Scarlett is a sinner,\" Victoria mentioned. So who is a saint and who is a sinner? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Scarlett is a saint/sinner, and Victoria is a saint/sinner>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Scarlett and Victoria, considering the nature of saints and sinners on the island.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - Scarlett says: \"Victoria is a sinner if and only if Scarlett is a saint.\"\n   - Victoria says: \"Victoria is a saint or Scarlett is a sinner.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing Scarlett's Statement:**\n   - The statement \"Victoria is a sinner if and only if Scarlett is a saint\" can be broken down into two parts:\n     - If Scarlett is a saint, then Victoria is a sinner.\n     - If Scarlett is a sinner, then Victoria is a saint.\n   - This is a biconditional statement, meaning both parts must be true or both must be false.\n\n3. **Analyzing Victoria's Statement:**\n   - The statement \"Victoria is a saint or Scarlett is a sinner\" is a logical OR statement.\n   - This means at least one of the following must be true:\n     - Victoria is a saint.\n     - Scarlett is a sinner.\n\n4. **Case Analysis:**\n\n   **Case 1: Scarlett is a Saint**\n   - If Scarlett is a saint, her statement must be true.\n   - Therefore, \"Victoria is a sinner if and only if Scarlett is a saint\" implies Victoria is a sinner.\n   - Now, check Victoria's statement: \"Victoria is a saint or Scarlett is a sinner.\"\n     - If Victoria is a sinner, then \"Victoria is a saint\" is false.\n     - Therefore, \"Scarlett is a sinner\" must be true for Victoria's statement to hold, which contradicts our assumption that Scarlett is a saint.\n   - Thus, Scarlett cannot be a saint.\n\n   **Case 2: Scarlett is a Sinner**\n   - If Scarlett is a sinner, her statement must be false.\n   - Therefore, \"Victoria is a sinner if and only if Scarlett is a saint\" is false.\n   - This means either:\n     - Victoria is a saint and Scarlett is a sinner (which is consistent with Scarlett being a sinner).\n     - Or Scarlett is a saint and Victoria is a sinner (which contradicts Scarlett being a sinner).\n   - Now, check Victoria's statement: \"Victoria is a saint or Scarlett is a sinner.\"\n     - If Scarlett is a sinner, this statement is true regardless of Victoria's status.\n   - Therefore, if Scarlett is a sinner, Victoria must be a saint to satisfy both statements.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only consistent scenario is that Scarlett is a sinner and Victoria is a saint.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Scarlett is a sinner, and Victoria is a saint>>>."
