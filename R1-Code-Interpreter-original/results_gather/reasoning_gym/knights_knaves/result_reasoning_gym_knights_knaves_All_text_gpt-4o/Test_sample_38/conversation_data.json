  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by sages and fools. Sages always tell the truth, and fools always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Olivia, and Abigail. Olivia was heard saying, \"Abigail is a sage\". Abigail commented, \"Olivia is a sage or Olivia is a fool\". So who is a sage and who is a fool? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Olivia is a sage/fool, and Abigail is a sage/fool>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Olivia and Abigail, considering the nature of sages and fools on the island.\n\n1. **Understanding the Characters:**\n   - Sages always tell the truth.\n   - Fools always lie.\n\n2. **Statements Analysis:**\n   - **Olivia's Statement:** \"Abigail is a sage.\"\n     - If Olivia is a sage, then her statement is true, meaning Abigail is indeed a sage.\n     - If Olivia is a fool, then her statement is false, meaning Abigail is not a sage (i.e., Abigail is a fool).\n\n   - **Abigail's Statement:** \"Olivia is a sage or Olivia is a fool.\"\n     - This statement is a tautology (always true) because Olivia can only be a sage or a fool. Therefore, this statement does not provide any new information about Abigail's nature.\n\n3. **Logical Deduction:**\n   - Let's assume Olivia is a sage:\n     - If Olivia is a sage, her statement \"Abigail is a sage\" must be true. Therefore, Abigail is a sage.\n     - This scenario is consistent because both Olivia and Abigail being sages means both tell the truth.\n\n   - Let's assume Olivia is a fool:\n     - If Olivia is a fool, her statement \"Abigail is a sage\" must be false. Therefore, Abigail is a fool.\n     - This scenario is also consistent because if Olivia is a fool, she lies, and Abigail being a fool means Abigail's statement \"Olivia is a sage or Olivia is a fool\" is still true (as it is a tautology).\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Both scenarios are logically consistent, but the problem does not provide enough information to definitively determine which scenario is true. However, the tautology in Abigail's statement suggests that the only definitive conclusion we can draw is that Olivia's statement is the key to determining the truth.\n   - Since Abigail's statement does not help us distinguish between the two scenarios, we rely on Olivia's statement. If Olivia is a sage, Abigail is a sage. If Olivia is a fool, Abigail is a fool. The problem does not provide a contradiction in either scenario, so we conclude that Olivia is a sage and Abigail is a sage.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<Olivia is a sage, and Abigail is a sage>>>."
