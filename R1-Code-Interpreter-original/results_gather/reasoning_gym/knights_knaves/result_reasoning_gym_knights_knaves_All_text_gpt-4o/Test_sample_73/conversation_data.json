  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by saints and sinners. Saints always tell the truth, and sinners always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Michael, and Liam. \"Liam is a saint or Liam is a sinner,\" Michael declared. \"Michael is a sinner and Michael is a saint\" - Liam. So who is a saint and who is a sinner? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Michael is a saint/sinner, and Liam is a saint/sinner>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Michael and Liam, keeping in mind the characteristics of saints and sinners:\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - Michael says: \"Liam is a saint or Liam is a sinner.\"\n   - Liam says: \"Michael is a sinner and Michael is a saint.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing Michael's Statement:**\n   - Michael's statement \"Liam is a saint or Liam is a sinner\" is a tautology. It is always true because any person must either be a saint or a sinner. Therefore, this statement does not provide any information about Michael's truthfulness. Both saints and sinners can make this statement.\n\n3. **Analyzing Liam's Statement:**\n   - Liam's statement \"Michael is a sinner and Michael is a saint\" is a contradiction. It cannot be true because a person cannot be both a sinner and a saint at the same time.\n   - If Liam were a saint, he would tell the truth, but his statement is a contradiction, which cannot be true. Therefore, Liam cannot be a saint.\n   - Since Liam cannot be a saint, he must be a sinner. Sinners always lie, so Liam's statement being false is consistent with him being a sinner.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Liam is a sinner, his statement is false, which aligns with the fact that it is a contradiction.\n   - Michael's statement is a tautology and does not help us determine his nature directly. However, since Liam is a sinner, and his statement about Michael being both a sinner and a saint is false, it does not affect Michael's status.\n   - Therefore, Michael can be a saint because his statement is true (as a tautology), and Liam's false statement does not contradict Michael being a saint.\n\nBased on the analysis, the conclusion is:\n<<<Michael is a saint, and Liam is a sinner>>>"
