  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by heros and villains. Heros always tell the truth, and villains always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Sofia, and Isabella. Sofia said that Isabella is a hero if and only if Isabella is a villain. Isabella asserted: \"Sofia is a hero\". So who is a hero and who is a villain? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Sofia is a hero/villain, and Isabella is a hero/villain>>>)",
  "response_list": [
    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Sofia and Isabella, considering the nature of heros and villains on the island.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - Sofia says: \"Isabella is a hero if and only if Isabella is a villain.\"\n   - Isabella says: \"Sofia is a hero.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing Sofia's Statement:**\n   - The statement \"Isabella is a hero if and only if Isabella is a villain\" is a logical contradiction. It can be broken down as:\n     - If Isabella is a hero, then Isabella is a villain.\n     - If Isabella is a villain, then Isabella is a hero.\n   - This statement can never be true because a person cannot be both a hero and a villain simultaneously.\n\n3. **Determining Sofia's Nature:**\n   - Since Sofia's statement is a contradiction, it cannot be true.\n   - Therefore, Sofia must be a villain (because villains lie).\n\n4. **Analyzing Isabella's Statement:**\n   - Isabella says: \"Sofia is a hero.\"\n   - Since we have determined that Sofia is a villain, Isabella's statement is false.\n\n5. **Determining Isabella's Nature:**\n   - Since Isabella's statement is false, Isabella must be a villain (because villains lie).\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Both Sofia and Isabella are villains.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: <<<Sofia is a villain, and Isabella is a villain>>>."
