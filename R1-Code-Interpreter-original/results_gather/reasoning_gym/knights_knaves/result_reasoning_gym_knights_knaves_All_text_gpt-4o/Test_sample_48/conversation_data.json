  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by heros and villains. Heros always tell the truth, and villains always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: David, and Harper. David asserted: \"Harper is a hero and Harper is a villain\". According to Harper, \"David is a hero if and only if David is a villain\". So who is a hero and who is a villain? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<David is a hero/villain, and Harper is a hero/villain>>>)",
  "response_list": [
    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by David and Harper, considering the nature of heros and villains on the island.\n\n1. **David's Statement: \"Harper is a hero and Harper is a villain.\"**\n   - This statement is a contradiction because a person cannot be both a hero and a villain simultaneously.\n   - If David were a hero (truth-teller), his statement would have to be true. However, since the statement is inherently contradictory, David cannot be a hero.\n   - Therefore, David must be a villain (liar).\n\n2. **Harper's Statement: \"David is a hero if and only if David is a villain.\"**\n   - This is a logical biconditional statement, which means both parts must have the same truth value for the entire statement to be true.\n   - If Harper were a hero (truth-teller), the statement would be true. However, \"David is a hero if and only if David is a villain\" is a contradiction because David cannot be both a hero and a villain at the same time.\n   - Therefore, Harper cannot be a hero, as a hero would not make a contradictory statement.\n   - Thus, Harper must also be a villain (liar).\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Both David and Harper are villains because their statements are contradictory and cannot be true.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: <<<David is a villain, and Harper is a villain>>>."
