  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by heros and villains. Heros always tell the truth, and villains always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Aiden, and Matthew. Aiden said that Matthew is a villain if and only if Matthew is a hero. Matthew asserted: \"Matthew is a hero and Aiden is a hero\". So who is a hero and who is a villain? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Aiden is a hero/villain, and Matthew is a hero/villain>>>)",
  "response_list": [
    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Aiden and Matthew, considering the nature of heros and villains on the island.\n\n1. **Understanding Aiden's Statement:**\n   - Aiden said, \"Matthew is a villain if and only if Matthew is a hero.\"\n   - This statement can be broken down into two parts:\n     - If Matthew is a villain, then Matthew is a hero.\n     - If Matthew is a hero, then Matthew is a villain.\n   - This is a logical contradiction because someone cannot be both a hero and a villain simultaneously.\n\n2. **Analyzing Aiden's Nature:**\n   - If Aiden is a hero (truth-teller), his statement must be true. However, the statement is a contradiction, which cannot be true.\n   - Therefore, Aiden cannot be a hero. Aiden must be a villain (liar).\n\n3. **Understanding Matthew's Statement:**\n   - Matthew said, \"Matthew is a hero and Aiden is a hero.\"\n   - This is a conjunction of two claims:\n     - Matthew is a hero.\n     - Aiden is a hero.\n\n4. **Analyzing Matthew's Nature:**\n   - If Matthew is a hero (truth-teller), then both parts of his statement must be true. However, we have already determined that Aiden is a villain, so the statement \"Aiden is a hero\" is false.\n   - Therefore, Matthew cannot be a hero. Matthew must be a villain (liar).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Both Aiden and Matthew are villains because their statements are false.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n<<<Aiden is a villain, and Matthew is a villain>>>"
