  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by saints and sinners. Saints always tell the truth, and sinners always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Ella, and Elizabeth. Ella commented, \"Elizabeth is a sinner if and only if Elizabeth is a saint\". \"Elizabeth is a saint and Ella is a saint\" - Elizabeth. So who is a saint and who is a sinner? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Ella is a saint/sinner, and Elizabeth is a saint/sinner>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Ella and Elizabeth and determine who is a saint and who is a sinner. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - **Ella's Statement:** \"Elizabeth is a sinner if and only if Elizabeth is a saint.\"\n     - This is a logical contradiction because someone cannot be both a sinner and a saint simultaneously. Therefore, this statement is inherently false.\n   - **Elizabeth's Statement:** \"Elizabeth is a saint and Ella is a saint.\"\n     - This is a straightforward statement that can be true or false.\n\n2. **Analyzing Ella's Statement:**\n   - Since Ella's statement is a contradiction, it must be false. Therefore, Ella must be a sinner (because sinners always lie).\n\n3. **Analyzing Elizabeth's Statement:**\n   - Since Ella is a sinner, Elizabeth's statement \"Elizabeth is a saint and Ella is a saint\" cannot be true in its entirety because Ella is not a saint.\n   - Therefore, Elizabeth's statement is false, which means Elizabeth must also be a sinner (because saints always tell the truth).\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Both Ella and Elizabeth are sinners because their statements are false.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Ella is a sinner, and Elizabeth is a sinner>>>"
