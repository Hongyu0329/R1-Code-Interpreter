  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by heros and villains. Heros always tell the truth, and villains always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Victoria, and Scarlett. Victoria said that Scarlett is a hero if and only if Scarlett is a villain. Scarlett asserted: \"if Victoria is a hero then Victoria is a villain\". So who is a hero and who is a villain? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Victoria is a hero/villain, and Scarlett is a hero/villain>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Victoria and Scarlett, considering the nature of heros and villains on the island.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - Victoria's statement: \"Scarlett is a hero if and only if Scarlett is a villain.\"\n     - This is a logical contradiction because someone cannot be both a hero and a villain at the same time. Therefore, if Victoria is telling the truth, this statement cannot be true, which implies Victoria must be lying. Hence, Victoria is a villain.\n   \n2. **Analyzing Scarlett's Statement:**\n   - Scarlett's statement: \"If Victoria is a hero then Victoria is a villain.\"\n     - This is a logical contradiction as well. If Victoria were a hero, she couldn't be a villain at the same time. However, since we have already deduced that Victoria is a villain, Scarlett's statement is actually true because the premise (Victoria being a hero) is false, making the whole implication true regardless of the conclusion.\n     - Therefore, Scarlett is telling the truth, which means Scarlett is a hero.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Victoria is a villain because her statement is a contradiction and cannot be true.\n   - Scarlett is a hero because her statement is logically consistent with the fact that Victoria is a villain.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Victoria is a villain, and Scarlett is a hero>>>"
