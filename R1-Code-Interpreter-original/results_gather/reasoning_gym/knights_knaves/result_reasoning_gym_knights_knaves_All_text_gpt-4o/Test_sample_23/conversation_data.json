  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by saints and sinners. Saints always tell the truth, and sinners always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Aria, and Sofia. As Aria put it, \"Sofia is a saint\". \"Aria is a sinner or Aria is a saint,\" Sofia declared. So who is a saint and who is a sinner? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Aria is a saint/sinner, and Sofia is a saint/sinner>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Aria and Sofia, keeping in mind the characteristics of saints and sinners:\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - Aria says, \"Sofia is a saint.\"\n   - Sofia says, \"Aria is a sinner or Aria is a saint.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing Aria's Statement:**\n   - If Aria is a saint, then her statement \"Sofia is a saint\" must be true. Therefore, Sofia would also be a saint.\n   - If Aria is a sinner, then her statement \"Sofia is a saint\" must be false. Therefore, Sofia would be a sinner.\n\n3. **Analyzing Sofia's Statement:**\n   - Sofia's statement \"Aria is a sinner or Aria is a saint\" is a logical tautology. This means it is always true regardless of whether Aria is a sinner or a saint. Therefore, Sofia's statement does not provide any new information about Aria's nature.\n\n4. **Evaluating the Scenarios:**\n   - **Scenario 1:** Assume Aria is a saint.\n     - If Aria is a saint, then her statement \"Sofia is a saint\" is true. Therefore, Sofia must be a saint.\n     - This scenario is consistent because both Aria and Sofia being saints means all statements are true.\n\n   - **Scenario 2:** Assume Aria is a sinner.\n     - If Aria is a sinner, then her statement \"Sofia is a saint\" is false. Therefore, Sofia must be a sinner.\n     - This scenario is also consistent because if both Aria and Sofia are sinners, Aria's false statement and Sofia's tautology (which is always true) do not contradict their nature.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Both scenarios are logically consistent, but the problem does not provide enough information to definitively determine which scenario is true. However, the tautology in Sofia's statement suggests that the problem is designed to highlight the possibility of both being sinners, as it does not help in distinguishing between the two scenarios.\n\nTherefore, the most straightforward conclusion, given the nature of the statements and the lack of contradiction in both scenarios, is that both Aria and Sofia are sinners.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Aria is a sinner, and Sofia is a sinner>>>."
