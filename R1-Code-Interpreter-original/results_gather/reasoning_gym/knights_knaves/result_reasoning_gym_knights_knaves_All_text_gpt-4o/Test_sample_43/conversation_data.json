  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by sages and fools. Sages always tell the truth, and fools always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Henry, and Chloe. Henry was heard saying, \"Chloe is a sage\". As Chloe put it, \"if Henry is a sage then Chloe is a sage\". So who is a sage and who is a fool? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Henry is a sage/fool, and Chloe is a sage/fool>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Henry and Chloe, considering the nature of sages and fools on the island.\n\n1. **Understanding the Characters:**\n   - Sages always tell the truth.\n   - Fools always lie.\n\n2. **Statements:**\n   - Henry says, \"Chloe is a sage.\"\n   - Chloe says, \"If Henry is a sage, then Chloe is a sage.\"\n\n3. **Analyzing Henry's Statement:**\n   - If Henry is a sage, then his statement \"Chloe is a sage\" must be true. Therefore, Chloe would also be a sage.\n   - If Henry is a fool, then his statement \"Chloe is a sage\" must be false. Therefore, Chloe would be a fool.\n\n4. **Analyzing Chloe's Statement:**\n   - Chloe's statement is a conditional: \"If Henry is a sage, then Chloe is a sage.\"\n   - If Chloe is a sage, then her statement must be true. This means if Henry is a sage, then Chloe must also be a sage.\n   - If Chloe is a fool, then her statement must be false. This means that even if Henry is a sage, Chloe would not be a sage.\n\n5. **Combining the Analysis:**\n   - **Case 1: Henry is a sage.**\n     - If Henry is a sage, then his statement \"Chloe is a sage\" is true. Therefore, Chloe is a sage.\n     - If Chloe is a sage, her statement \"If Henry is a sage, then Chloe is a sage\" is true, which is consistent.\n     - This scenario is consistent: Henry is a sage, and Chloe is a sage.\n\n   - **Case 2: Henry is a fool.**\n     - If Henry is a fool, then his statement \"Chloe is a sage\" is false. Therefore, Chloe is a fool.\n     - If Chloe is a fool, her statement \"If Henry is a sage, then Chloe is a sage\" is false. This means that even if Henry were a sage, Chloe would not be a sage, which is consistent with Chloe being a fool.\n     - This scenario is also consistent: Henry is a fool, and Chloe is a fool.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Both scenarios are internally consistent, but we need to determine which one is possible given the statements.\n   - The key lies in Chloe's statement. If Chloe is a sage, her statement must be true, which aligns with Henry being a sage. If Chloe is a fool, her statement is false, which aligns with Henry being a fool.\n   - Since both scenarios are possible, we need to consider the logical implications: Chloe's statement is a tautology if she is a sage, and a contradiction if she is a fool. The only consistent scenario without contradiction is that both are sages.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: <<<Henry is a sage, and Chloe is a sage>>>."
