  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by altruists and egoists. Altruists always tell the truth, and egoists always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Zoey, and Ella. Zoey said that if Ella is an altruist then Zoey is an altruist. Ella stated, \"Zoey is an altruist if and only if Zoey is an egoist\". So who is an altruist and who is an egoist? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Zoey is a altruist/egoist, and Ella is a altruist/egoist>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Zoey and Ella and determine their truthfulness based on the nature of altruists and egoists.\n\n1. **Understanding the Characters:**\n   - Altruists always tell the truth.\n   - Egoists always lie.\n\n2. **Statements Analysis:**\n   - **Zoey's Statement:** \"If Ella is an altruist, then Zoey is an altruist.\"\n     - This is a conditional statement: If \\( E \\) (Ella is an altruist), then \\( Z \\) (Zoey is an altruist).\n     - In logical terms, this is \\( E \\rightarrow Z \\).\n\n   - **Ella's Statement:** \"Zoey is an altruist if and only if Zoey is an egoist.\"\n     - This is a biconditional statement: \\( Z \\leftrightarrow \\neg Z \\).\n     - This statement is a contradiction because it implies that Zoey is both an altruist and an egoist simultaneously, which is impossible.\n\n3. **Analyzing Ella's Statement:**\n   - Since Ella's statement is a contradiction, it cannot be true.\n   - Therefore, Ella must be an egoist (since egoists lie).\n\n4. **Analyzing Zoey's Statement:**\n   - Since Ella is an egoist, the premise of Zoey's statement (\"If Ella is an altruist\") is false.\n   - In logic, a conditional statement with a false premise is always true, regardless of the truth value of the conclusion.\n   - Therefore, Zoey's statement is true.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Zoey's statement is true, Zoey must be an altruist (because altruists tell the truth).\n\nBased on the analysis, we conclude:\n- Zoey is an altruist.\n- Ella is an egoist.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Zoey is an altruist, and Ella is an egoist>>>."
