  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Emily, and Abigail. According to Emily, \"Abigail is a knight or Emily is a knight\". Abigail said that Emily is a knave if and only if Abigail is a knight. So who is a knight and who is a knave? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Emily is a knight/knave, and Abigail is a knight/knave>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Emily and Abigail, considering the nature of knights and knaves.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - Emily says: \"Abigail is a knight or Emily is a knight.\"\n   - Abigail says: \"Emily is a knave if and only if Abigail is a knight.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing Emily's Statement:**\n   - If Emily is a knight, her statement is true. Therefore, either Abigail is a knight, or Emily is a knight (which is already true if Emily is a knight).\n   - If Emily is a knave, her statement is false. Therefore, neither Abigail is a knight nor Emily is a knight. But if Emily is a knave, this part of the statement is consistent.\n\n3. **Analyzing Abigail's Statement:**\n   - Abigail's statement is a biconditional: \"Emily is a knave if and only if Abigail is a knight.\"\n   - If Abigail is a knight, her statement is true. Therefore, Emily must be a knave.\n   - If Abigail is a knave, her statement is false. Therefore, it is not true that \"Emily is a knave if and only if Abigail is a knight.\" This means either Emily is not a knave, or Abigail is not a knight, or both.\n\n4. **Considering Possible Scenarios:**\n   - **Scenario 1:** Emily is a knight.\n     - Emily's statement is true, so \"Abigail is a knight or Emily is a knight\" is true. Since Emily is a knight, this is consistent.\n     - If Emily is a knight, Abigail's statement \"Emily is a knave if and only if Abigail is a knight\" must be false (since Emily is not a knave). Therefore, Abigail must be a knave.\n\n   - **Scenario 2:** Emily is a knave.\n     - Emily's statement is false, so \"Abigail is a knight or Emily is a knight\" is false. This means neither Abigail is a knight nor Emily is a knight. But Emily is already assumed to be a knave, so Abigail must also be a knave.\n     - If Abigail is a knave, her statement \"Emily is a knave if and only if Abigail is a knight\" is false. This is consistent because Abigail is not a knight.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - In Scenario 1, Emily is a knight and Abigail is a knave.\n   - In Scenario 2, Emily is a knave and Abigail is a knave.\n   - Scenario 1 is consistent with the rules of knights and knaves, while Scenario 2 leads to a contradiction because Abigail's statement cannot be false if both are knaves.\n\nTherefore, the only consistent scenario is that Emily is a knight and Abigail is a knave.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n<<<Emily is a knight, and Abigail is a knave>>>"
