  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by altruists and egoists. Altruists always tell the truth, and egoists always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: James, and Victoria. James remarked, \"Victoria is an altruist or James is an altruist\". Victoria was heard saying, \"James is an egoist\". So who is an altruist and who is an egoist? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<James is a altruist/egoist, and Victoria is a altruist/egoist>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by James and Victoria, considering the nature of altruists and egoists on the island.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - James says, \"Victoria is an altruist or James is an altruist.\"\n   - Victoria says, \"James is an egoist.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing James's Statement:**\n   - If James is an altruist (truth-teller), then his statement \"Victoria is an altruist or James is an altruist\" must be true. This means at least one part of the statement is true. Since James is already assumed to be an altruist, the statement holds true regardless of Victoria's nature.\n   - If James is an egoist (liar), then his statement must be false. This means neither \"Victoria is an altruist\" nor \"James is an altruist\" is true. Therefore, both James and Victoria would be egoists.\n\n3. **Analyzing Victoria's Statement:**\n   - If Victoria is an altruist, then her statement \"James is an egoist\" must be true. This means James is indeed an egoist.\n   - If Victoria is an egoist, then her statement \"James is an egoist\" must be false. This means James is an altruist.\n\n4. **Combining the Analyses:**\n   - Assume James is an altruist:\n     - His statement is true, so \"Victoria is an altruist or James is an altruist\" is true. Since James is an altruist, this holds.\n     - Victoria's statement \"James is an egoist\" would be false, which contradicts her being an altruist. Therefore, Victoria must be an egoist.\n   - Assume James is an egoist:\n     - His statement is false, so neither \"Victoria is an altruist\" nor \"James is an altruist\" is true. This means both are egoists.\n     - However, if both are egoists, Victoria's statement \"James is an egoist\" would be true, which contradicts her being an egoist (since egoists lie).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only consistent scenario is that James is an altruist and Victoria is an egoist. This satisfies all conditions: James's statement is true, and Victoria's statement is false.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<James is an altruist, and Victoria is an egoist>>>."
