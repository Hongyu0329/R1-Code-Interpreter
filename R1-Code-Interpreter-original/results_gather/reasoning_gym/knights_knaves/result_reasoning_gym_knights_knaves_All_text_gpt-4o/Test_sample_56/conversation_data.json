  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Aiden, and Sophia. \"if Aiden is a knight then Sophia is a knave,\" Aiden claimed. \"Sophia is a knight and Aiden is a knight\" - Sophia. So who is a knight and who is a knave? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Aiden is a knight/knave, and Sophia is a knight/knave>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Aiden and Sophia and determine who is a knight and who is a knave. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - Aiden says: \"If Aiden is a knight, then Sophia is a knave.\"\n   - Sophia says: \"Sophia is a knight and Aiden is a knight.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing Aiden's Statement:**\n   - Aiden's statement is a conditional statement: \"If Aiden is a knight, then Sophia is a knave.\"\n   - If Aiden is a knight, then his statement must be true. Therefore, Sophia must be a knave.\n   - If Aiden is a knave, then his statement is false. The negation of his statement is: \"Aiden is a knight and Sophia is a knight.\"\n\n3. **Analyzing Sophia's Statement:**\n   - Sophia claims: \"Sophia is a knight and Aiden is a knight.\"\n   - If Sophia is a knight, then her statement must be true, meaning both Sophia and Aiden are knights.\n   - If Sophia is a knave, then her statement is false, meaning at least one part of her statement is false.\n\n4. **Considering the Possibilities:**\n   - **Case 1: Aiden is a knight.**\n     - If Aiden is a knight, then his statement is true, which means Sophia is a knave.\n     - If Sophia is a knave, then her statement \"Sophia is a knight and Aiden is a knight\" is false. This is consistent because Sophia being a knave means her statement is false.\n\n   - **Case 2: Aiden is a knave.**\n     - If Aiden is a knave, then his statement is false. The negation of his statement is: \"Aiden is a knight and Sophia is a knight.\"\n     - This creates a contradiction because if Aiden is a knave, he cannot be a knight.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only consistent scenario is Case 1, where Aiden is a knight and Sophia is a knave. This satisfies both Aiden's truthful statement and the falsity of Sophia's statement.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: <<<Aiden is a knight, and Sophia is a knave>>>."
