  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by heros and villains. Heros always tell the truth, and villains always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Isabella, and Jack. \"Isabella is a hero and Jack is a hero,\" Isabella mentioned. As Jack put it, \"Isabella is a hero if and only if Isabella is a villain\". So who is a hero and who is a villain? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Isabella is a hero/villain, and Jack is a hero/villain>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Isabella and Jack, considering the nature of heros and villains on the island.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - Isabella says: \"Isabella is a hero and Jack is a hero.\"\n   - Jack says: \"Isabella is a hero if and only if Isabella is a villain.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing Isabella's Statement:**\n   - If Isabella is a hero, her statement must be true. Therefore, both Isabella and Jack would be heroes.\n   - If Isabella is a villain, her statement must be false. Therefore, at least one of them is not a hero.\n\n3. **Analyzing Jack's Statement:**\n   - Jack's statement is a logical contradiction: \"Isabella is a hero if and only if Isabella is a villain.\"\n   - This statement can never be true because it implies that Isabella is both a hero and a villain simultaneously, which is impossible.\n\n4. **Determining Jack's Nature:**\n   - Since Jack's statement is a contradiction and cannot be true, Jack must be a villain (because villains lie).\n\n5. **Re-evaluating Isabella's Statement with Jack as a Villain:**\n   - If Jack is a villain, Isabella's statement \"Isabella is a hero and Jack is a hero\" must be false.\n   - Therefore, Isabella cannot be a hero because her statement would then be true, which contradicts the fact that Jack is a villain.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Isabella's statement is false, Isabella must be a villain.\n   - Jack, as determined from his contradictory statement, is also a villain.\n\nThus, both Isabella and Jack are villains.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Isabella is a villain, and Jack is a villain>>>"
