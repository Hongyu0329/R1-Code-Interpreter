  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by sages and fools. Sages always tell the truth, and fools always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Lucas, and Jacob. In a statement by Lucas: \"Lucas is a sage if and only if Jacob is a sage\". Jacob remarked, \"if Jacob is a sage then Lucas is a fool\". So who is a sage and who is a fool? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Lucas is a sage/fool, and Jacob is a sage/fool>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Lucas and Jacob and determine their truthfulness based on the nature of sages and fools.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - Lucas says: \"Lucas is a sage if and only if Jacob is a sage.\"\n     - This is a biconditional statement, meaning both parts must be true or both must be false for the entire statement to be true.\n   - Jacob says: \"If Jacob is a sage then Lucas is a fool.\"\n     - This is a conditional statement, meaning if the first part (Jacob is a sage) is true, then the second part (Lucas is a fool) must also be true for the statement to be true.\n\n2. **Analyzing Lucas's Statement:**\n   - If Lucas is a sage, his statement must be true. Therefore, both Lucas and Jacob must be sages.\n   - If Lucas is a fool, his statement must be false. Therefore, one of them is a sage and the other is a fool.\n\n3. **Analyzing Jacob's Statement:**\n   - If Jacob is a sage, his statement must be true. Therefore, if Jacob is a sage, Lucas must be a fool.\n   - If Jacob is a fool, his statement must be false. Therefore, if Jacob is a sage, Lucas cannot be a fool (Lucas must be a sage).\n\n4. **Combining the Analysis:**\n   - Assume Lucas is a sage:\n     - Lucas's statement is true, so Jacob must also be a sage.\n     - However, if Jacob is a sage, Jacob's statement implies Lucas is a fool, which contradicts our assumption.\n   - Therefore, Lucas cannot be a sage.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Lucas must be a fool.\n   - Since Lucas is a fool, his statement is false, meaning one of them is a sage and the other is a fool.\n   - Jacob's statement must be false (since Jacob is a fool), meaning if Jacob is a sage, Lucas cannot be a fool. This is consistent with Jacob being a fool.\n   - Therefore, Jacob must be a sage.\n\nThus, the final answer is: <<<Lucas is a fool, and Jacob is a sage>>>."
