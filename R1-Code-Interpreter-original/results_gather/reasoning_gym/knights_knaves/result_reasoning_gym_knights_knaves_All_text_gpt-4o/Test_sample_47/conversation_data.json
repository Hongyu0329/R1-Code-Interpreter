  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by saints and sinners. Saints always tell the truth, and sinners always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Ava, and Harper. Ava was heard saying, \"Harper is a sinner or Harper is a saint\". Harper commented, \"Ava is a saint if and only if Ava is a sinner\". So who is a saint and who is a sinner? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Ava is a saint/sinner, and Harper is a saint/sinner>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Ava and Harper, considering the nature of saints and sinners on the island.\n\n1. **Understanding Ava's Statement:**\n   - Ava says, \"Harper is a sinner or Harper is a saint.\"\n   - This statement is a tautology because it covers all possibilities: Harper can only be a sinner or a saint. Therefore, this statement is always true, regardless of whether Ava is a saint or a sinner.\n\n2. **Understanding Harper's Statement:**\n   - Harper says, \"Ava is a saint if and only if Ava is a sinner.\"\n   - This statement is a contradiction because it claims that Ava can be both a saint and a sinner simultaneously, which is impossible. Therefore, this statement is always false.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Implications:**\n   - Since Ava's statement is always true, it does not provide any information about Ava's nature. Ava could be either a saint or a sinner.\n   - Harper's statement, however, is always false. Since saints always tell the truth, Harper cannot be a saint. Therefore, Harper must be a sinner.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Harper is a sinner, which means Harper's statement is false, as expected.\n   - Since Harper is a sinner, Ava's statement does not help us determine Ava's nature directly. However, since Harper's statement is false, it does not affect Ava's status. Ava's statement being a tautology means it doesn't contradict her being a saint.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis, we conclude:\n<<<Ava is a saint, and Harper is a sinner>>>"
