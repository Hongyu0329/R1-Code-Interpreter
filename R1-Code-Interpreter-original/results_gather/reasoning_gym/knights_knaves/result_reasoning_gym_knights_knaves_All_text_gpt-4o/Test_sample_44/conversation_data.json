  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Ava, and Scarlett. Ava told you that Ava is a knight if and only if Scarlett is a knave. Scarlett stated, \"if Ava is a knight then Scarlett is a knight\". So who is a knight and who is a knave? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Ava is a knight/knave, and Scarlett is a knight/knave>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Ava and Scarlett and determine their truthfulness based on the nature of knights and knaves.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - Ava says: \"Ava is a knight if and only if Scarlett is a knave.\"\n   - Scarlett says: \"If Ava is a knight, then Scarlett is a knight.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing Ava's Statement:**\n   - Ava's statement is a biconditional: \"Ava is a knight if and only if Scarlett is a knave.\"\n   - This can be broken down into two implications:\n     - If Ava is a knight, then Scarlett is a knave.\n     - If Scarlett is a knave, then Ava is a knight.\n\n3. **Analyzing Scarlett's Statement:**\n   - Scarlett's statement is a conditional: \"If Ava is a knight, then Scarlett is a knight.\"\n\n4. **Considering Possible Scenarios:**\n\n   **Scenario 1: Ava is a knight.**\n   - If Ava is a knight, her statement must be true. Therefore, Scarlett must be a knave.\n   - If Scarlett is a knave, her statement must be false. The statement \"If Ava is a knight, then Scarlett is a knight\" is false if Ava is a knight and Scarlett is not a knight.\n   - This scenario is consistent because Scarlett being a knave makes her statement false, which aligns with her nature.\n\n   **Scenario 2: Ava is a knave.**\n   - If Ava is a knave, her statement must be false. Therefore, it is not true that \"Ava is a knight if and only if Scarlett is a knave.\"\n   - This means either Ava is not a knight or Scarlett is not a knave, or both.\n   - If Scarlett is not a knave, then Scarlett is a knight, and her statement must be true. However, Scarlett's statement \"If Ava is a knight, then Scarlett is a knight\" would be vacuously true if Ava is not a knight.\n   - This scenario leads to a contradiction because if Scarlett is a knight, Ava's statement being false would imply Scarlett is a knave, which contradicts Scarlett being a knight.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only consistent scenario is Scenario 1, where Ava is a knight and Scarlett is a knave.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<Ava is a knight, and Scarlett is a knave>>>."
