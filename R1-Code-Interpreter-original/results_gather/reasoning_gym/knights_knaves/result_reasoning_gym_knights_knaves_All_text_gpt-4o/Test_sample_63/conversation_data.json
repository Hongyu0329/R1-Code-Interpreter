  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by angels and devils. Angels always tell the truth, and devils always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Aurora, and Owen. Aurora stated, \"Owen is a devil if and only if Aurora is an angel\". Owen told you that Aurora is an angel or Owen is an angel. So who is an angel and who is a devil? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Aurora is a angel/devil, and Owen is a angel/devil>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Aurora and Owen, considering the nature of angels and devils on the island.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - Aurora says, \"Owen is a devil if and only if Aurora is an angel.\"\n   - Owen says, \"Aurora is an angel or Owen is an angel.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing Aurora's Statement:**\n   - The statement \"Owen is a devil if and only if Aurora is an angel\" can be broken down into a logical equivalence:\n     - If Aurora is an angel, then Owen is a devil.\n     - If Aurora is a devil, then Owen is an angel.\n   - This is a biconditional statement, meaning both parts must be true or both must be false.\n\n3. **Analyzing Owen's Statement:**\n   - Owen's statement \"Aurora is an angel or Owen is an angel\" is a logical disjunction:\n     - At least one of them must be an angel for the statement to be true.\n\n4. **Case Analysis:**\n\n   **Case 1: Assume Aurora is an angel.**\n   - If Aurora is an angel, she tells the truth.\n   - According to her statement, \"Owen is a devil if and only if Aurora is an angel,\" Owen must be a devil.\n   - Check Owen's statement: \"Aurora is an angel or Owen is an angel.\"\n     - Since Aurora is an angel, Owen's statement is true, which contradicts him being a devil (since devils always lie).\n   - Therefore, this case leads to a contradiction.\n\n   **Case 2: Assume Aurora is a devil.**\n   - If Aurora is a devil, she lies.\n   - Her statement \"Owen is a devil if and only if Aurora is an angel\" is false.\n   - The negation of her statement is: \"Owen is an angel if and only if Aurora is a devil.\"\n   - Therefore, if Aurora is a devil, Owen must be an angel.\n   - Check Owen's statement: \"Aurora is an angel or Owen is an angel.\"\n     - Since Owen is an angel, his statement is true, which is consistent with him being an angel.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only consistent scenario is that Aurora is a devil and Owen is an angel.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<Aurora is a devil, and Owen is an angel>>>."
