  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Riley, and Grace. Riley was heard saying, \"Grace is a knight or Grace is a knave\". Grace stated, \"Riley is a knave if and only if Riley is a knight\". So who is a knight and who is a knave? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Riley is a knight/knave, and Grace is a knight/knave>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Riley and Grace, considering the nature of knights and knaves.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - Riley says, \"Grace is a knight or Grace is a knave.\"\n   - Grace says, \"Riley is a knave if and only if Riley is a knight.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing Riley's Statement:**\n   - Riley's statement \"Grace is a knight or Grace is a knave\" is a tautology. This statement is always true because every inhabitant is either a knight or a knave. Therefore, Riley's statement does not provide any new information about Riley's own nature.\n\n3. **Analyzing Grace's Statement:**\n   - Grace's statement \"Riley is a knave if and only if Riley is a knight\" is a contradiction. The statement \"if and only if\" means both conditions must be true or both must be false. However, Riley cannot be both a knight and a knave simultaneously, nor can Riley be neither. Therefore, Grace's statement is inherently false.\n\n4. **Determining the Nature of Grace:**\n   - Since Grace's statement is false, Grace must be a knave (because knaves always lie).\n\n5. **Determining the Nature of Riley:**\n   - Since Grace is a knave, Riley's statement, which is a tautology, does not affect his nature. However, since Grace is a knave and her statement about Riley is false, it implies that Riley is not a knave. Therefore, Riley must be a knight.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Riley is a knight, and Grace is a knave.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Riley is a knight, and Grace is a knave>>>"
