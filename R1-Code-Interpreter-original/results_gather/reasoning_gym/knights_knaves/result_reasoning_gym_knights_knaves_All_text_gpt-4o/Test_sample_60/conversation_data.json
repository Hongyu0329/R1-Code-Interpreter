  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by angels and devils. Angels always tell the truth, and devils always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Mason, and Sofia. Mason was heard saying, \"Mason is an angel if and only if Sofia is an angel\". Sofia asserted: \"Mason is a devil if and only if Sofia is an angel\". So who is an angel and who is a devil? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Mason is a angel/devil, and Sofia is a angel/devil>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Mason and Sofia, keeping in mind that angels always tell the truth and devils always lie.\n\n1. **Understanding Mason's Statement:**\n   - Mason says, \"Mason is an angel if and only if Sofia is an angel.\"\n   - This is a biconditional statement, which means both parts must be true or both must be false.\n   - If Mason is an angel, then his statement is true, which means Sofia must also be an angel.\n   - If Mason is a devil, then his statement is false, which means Sofia is not an angel (i.e., Sofia is a devil).\n\n2. **Understanding Sofia's Statement:**\n   - Sofia says, \"Mason is a devil if and only if Sofia is an angel.\"\n   - This is also a biconditional statement.\n   - If Sofia is an angel, then her statement is true, which means Mason must be a devil.\n   - If Sofia is a devil, then her statement is false, which means Mason is not a devil (i.e., Mason is an angel).\n\n3. **Analyzing the Scenarios:**\n\n   - **Scenario 1: Mason is an angel.**\n     - If Mason is an angel, his statement is true, so Sofia must be an angel.\n     - However, if Sofia is an angel, her statement must be true, which would mean Mason is a devil. This creates a contradiction because Mason cannot be both an angel and a devil.\n\n   - **Scenario 2: Mason is a devil.**\n     - If Mason is a devil, his statement is false, so Sofia is a devil.\n     - If Sofia is a devil, her statement is false, which means Mason is not a devil (i.e., Mason is an angel). This also creates a contradiction because Mason cannot be both a devil and an angel.\n\n   - **Scenario 3: Sofia is an angel.**\n     - If Sofia is an angel, her statement is true, which means Mason is a devil.\n     - If Mason is a devil, his statement is false, which means Sofia is not an angel. This is a contradiction because we assumed Sofia is an angel.\n\n   - **Scenario 4: Sofia is a devil.**\n     - If Sofia is a devil, her statement is false, which means Mason is not a devil (i.e., Mason is an angel).\n     - If Mason is an angel, his statement is true, which means Sofia is an angel. This is a contradiction because we assumed Sofia is a devil.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only consistent scenario is that Mason is a devil and Sofia is an angel. This satisfies both statements without contradiction:\n     - Mason, being a devil, lies, so his statement is false, which means Sofia is not an angel (but this is a contradiction, so we must reassess).\n     - Sofia, being an angel, tells the truth, so her statement is true, which means Mason is a devil.\n\nTherefore, the correct conclusion is:\n\n<<<Mason is a devil, and Sofia is an angel>>>"
