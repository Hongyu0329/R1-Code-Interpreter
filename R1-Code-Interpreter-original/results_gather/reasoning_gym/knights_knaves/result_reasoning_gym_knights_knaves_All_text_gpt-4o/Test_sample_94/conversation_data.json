  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by sages and fools. Sages always tell the truth, and fools always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Logan, and Jacob. Logan noted, \"if Jacob is a sage then Logan is a sage\". Jacob said that Logan is a sage. So who is a sage and who is a fool? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Logan is a sage/fool, and Jacob is a sage/fool>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Logan and Jacob and determine who is a sage and who is a fool. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Characters:**\n   - Sages always tell the truth.\n   - Fools always lie.\n\n2. **Statements:**\n   - Logan says, \"If Jacob is a sage, then Logan is a sage.\"\n   - Jacob says, \"Logan is a sage.\"\n\n3. **Analyzing Logan's Statement:**\n   - Logan's statement is a conditional statement: \"If Jacob is a sage, then Logan is a sage.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: If J (Jacob is a sage), then L (Logan is a sage).\n\n4. **Analyzing Jacob's Statement:**\n   - Jacob claims that Logan is a sage.\n\n5. **Case Analysis:**\n\n   **Case 1: Assume Jacob is a sage.**\n   - If Jacob is a sage, then his statement \"Logan is a sage\" must be true.\n   - Therefore, Logan must be a sage.\n   - If Logan is a sage, then his statement \"If Jacob is a sage, then Logan is a sage\" is true, which is consistent because we assumed Jacob is a sage and concluded Logan is a sage.\n   - This scenario is consistent.\n\n   **Case 2: Assume Jacob is a fool.**\n   - If Jacob is a fool, then his statement \"Logan is a sage\" must be false.\n   - Therefore, Logan must be a fool.\n   - If Logan is a fool, then his statement \"If Jacob is a sage, then Logan is a sage\" is false.\n   - For Logan's statement to be false, the condition \"Jacob is a sage\" must be true, which contradicts our assumption that Jacob is a fool.\n   - This scenario is inconsistent.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only consistent scenario is Case 1, where Jacob is a sage and Logan is a sage.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<Logan is a sage, and Jacob is a sage>>>."
