  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by heros and villains. Heros always tell the truth, and villains always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Amelia, and Jack. \"if Jack is a hero then Jack is a villain,\" Amelia mentioned. Jack told you that Amelia is a villain if and only if Amelia is a hero. So who is a hero and who is a villain? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Amelia is a hero/villain, and Jack is a hero/villain>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Amelia and Jack, considering the nature of heros and villains on the island.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - Amelia says: \"If Jack is a hero then Jack is a villain.\"\n   - Jack says: \"Amelia is a villain if and only if Amelia is a hero.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing Amelia's Statement:**\n   - Amelia's statement is a conditional statement: \"If Jack is a hero, then Jack is a villain.\"\n   - If Amelia is a hero (truth-teller), her statement must be true. However, the statement \"If Jack is a hero, then Jack is a villain\" is a contradiction because someone cannot be both a hero and a villain simultaneously. Therefore, if Amelia is a hero, her statement cannot be true, which is a contradiction. Thus, Amelia cannot be a hero.\n   - If Amelia is a villain (liar), her statement must be false. The negation of her statement is: \"Jack is a hero and Jack is not a villain,\" which is consistent because it does not create a contradiction. Therefore, Amelia being a villain makes her statement false, which is consistent with her being a liar.\n\n3. **Analyzing Jack's Statement:**\n   - Jack's statement is: \"Amelia is a villain if and only if Amelia is a hero.\"\n   - This is a biconditional statement, which means both parts must have the same truth value.\n   - If Jack is a hero (truth-teller), his statement must be true. However, the statement \"Amelia is a villain if and only if Amelia is a hero\" is a contradiction because Amelia cannot be both a villain and a hero simultaneously. Therefore, if Jack is a hero, his statement cannot be true, which is a contradiction. Thus, Jack cannot be a hero.\n   - If Jack is a villain (liar), his statement must be false. The negation of his statement is: \"Amelia is a villain or Amelia is not a hero,\" which is consistent because Amelia is indeed a villain. Therefore, Jack being a villain makes his statement false, which is consistent with him being a liar.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Both Amelia and Jack are villains. Amelia's statement is false because Jack is not a hero, and Jack's statement is false because Amelia is indeed a villain.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: <<<Amelia is a villain, and Jack is a villain>>>."
