  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Ella, and Alexander. Ella asserted: \"Ella is a knight or Alexander is a knight\". In Alexander's words: \"Ella is a knave\". So who is a knight and who is a knave? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Ella is a knight/knave, and Alexander is a knight/knave>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Ella and Alexander, considering the nature of knights and knaves.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - Ella says: \"Ella is a knight or Alexander is a knight.\"\n   - Alexander says: \"Ella is a knave.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing Ella's Statement:**\n   - If Ella is a knight, her statement must be true. Therefore, \"Ella is a knight or Alexander is a knight\" is true. This means at least one of them is a knight.\n   - If Ella is a knave, her statement must be false. Therefore, \"Ella is a knight or Alexander is a knight\" is false. This means neither Ella nor Alexander is a knight, which implies both are knaves.\n\n3. **Analyzing Alexander's Statement:**\n   - If Alexander is a knight, his statement must be true. Therefore, \"Ella is a knave\" is true, meaning Ella is indeed a knave.\n   - If Alexander is a knave, his statement must be false. Therefore, \"Ella is a knave\" is false, meaning Ella is a knight.\n\n4. **Combining the Analysis:**\n   - **Case 1:** Assume Ella is a knight.\n     - Her statement \"Ella is a knight or Alexander is a knight\" is true. This is consistent because she is a knight.\n     - Alexander's statement \"Ella is a knave\" would be false, which is consistent if Alexander is a knave.\n     - Conclusion: Ella is a knight, and Alexander is a knave.\n\n   - **Case 2:** Assume Ella is a knave.\n     - Her statement \"Ella is a knight or Alexander is a knight\" is false. This means neither is a knight, which implies both are knaves.\n     - Alexander's statement \"Ella is a knave\" would be true, which is inconsistent because a knave cannot make a true statement.\n     - Conclusion: This case leads to a contradiction.\n\n5. **Final Conclusion:**\n   - The only consistent scenario is Case 1, where Ella is a knight and Alexander is a knave.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<Ella is a knight, and Alexander is a knave>>>."
