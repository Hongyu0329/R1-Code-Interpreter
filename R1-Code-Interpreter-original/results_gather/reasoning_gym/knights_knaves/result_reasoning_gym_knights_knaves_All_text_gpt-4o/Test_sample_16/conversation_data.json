  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by saints and sinners. Saints always tell the truth, and sinners always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Alexander, and Sofia. Alexander expressed that Sofia is a saint and Sofia is a sinner. \"Alexander is a saint,\" Sofia claimed. So who is a saint and who is a sinner? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Alexander is a saint/sinner, and Sofia is a saint/sinner>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Alexander and Sofia, considering the nature of saints and sinners.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - Alexander makes two claims:\n     1. Sofia is a saint.\n     2. Sofia is a sinner.\n   - Sofia makes one claim:\n     1. Alexander is a saint.\n\n2. **Analyzing Alexander's Statements:**\n   - If Alexander is a saint (truth-teller), both of his statements must be true. However, it is impossible for Sofia to be both a saint and a sinner simultaneously. Therefore, Alexander cannot be a saint.\n   - If Alexander is a sinner (liar), at least one of his statements must be false. Since both statements cannot be true, this is consistent with him being a sinner.\n\n3. **Analyzing Sofia's Statement:**\n   - Sofia claims that Alexander is a saint.\n   - If Sofia is a saint (truth-teller), her statement must be true, which contradicts our conclusion that Alexander is a sinner. Therefore, Sofia cannot be a saint.\n   - If Sofia is a sinner (liar), her statement must be false, which is consistent with our conclusion that Alexander is a sinner.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the analysis, Alexander is a sinner because his statements are contradictory, and Sofia is a sinner because her statement is false.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: <<<Alexander is a sinner, and Sofia is a sinner>>>."
