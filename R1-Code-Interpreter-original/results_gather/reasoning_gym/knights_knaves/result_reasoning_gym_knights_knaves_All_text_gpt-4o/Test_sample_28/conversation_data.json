  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by pioneers and laggards. Pioneers always tell the truth, and laggards always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Benjamin, and Sofia. Benjamin asserted: \"Benjamin is a pioneer or Sofia is a laggard\". Sofia commented, \"Benjamin is a pioneer if and only if Benjamin is a laggard\". So who is a pioneer and who is a laggard? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Benjamin is a pioneer/laggard, and Sofia is a pioneer/laggard>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Benjamin and Sofia, considering the nature of pioneers and laggards.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - Benjamin says: \"Benjamin is a pioneer or Sofia is a laggard.\"\n   - Sofia says: \"Benjamin is a pioneer if and only if Benjamin is a laggard.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing Benjamin's Statement:**\n   - If Benjamin is a pioneer (truth-teller), then his statement must be true. This means either Benjamin is a pioneer or Sofia is a laggard (or both).\n   - If Benjamin is a laggard (liar), then his statement must be false. This means neither Benjamin is a pioneer nor Sofia is a laggard.\n\n3. **Analyzing Sofia's Statement:**\n   - Sofia's statement is a logical equivalence: \"Benjamin is a pioneer if and only if Benjamin is a laggard.\"\n   - This statement can only be true if both sides are the same, which is impossible because a person cannot be both a pioneer and a laggard simultaneously.\n   - Therefore, if Sofia is a pioneer, her statement must be false, which is a contradiction. Hence, Sofia cannot be a pioneer.\n\n4. **Conclusion from Sofia's Analysis:**\n   - Since Sofia cannot be a pioneer, she must be a laggard. This means her statement is false, which aligns with the logical impossibility of her statement being true.\n\n5. **Revisiting Benjamin's Statement with Sofia as a Laggard:**\n   - If Sofia is a laggard, then Benjamin's statement \"Benjamin is a pioneer or Sofia is a laggard\" can be true if Benjamin is a pioneer.\n   - If Benjamin is a pioneer, his statement is true because Sofia is indeed a laggard.\n\n6. **Final Conclusion:**\n   - Benjamin is a pioneer because his statement is consistent with Sofia being a laggard.\n   - Sofia is a laggard because her statement is false, as it must be for a laggard.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: <<<Benjamin is a pioneer, and Sofia is a laggard>>>."
