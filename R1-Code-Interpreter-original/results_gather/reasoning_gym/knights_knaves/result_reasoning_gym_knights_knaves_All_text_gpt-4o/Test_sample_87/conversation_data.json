  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by pioneers and laggards. Pioneers always tell the truth, and laggards always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Evelyn, and Liam. Evelyn said that if Evelyn is a pioneer then Liam is a laggard. Liam remarked, \"Evelyn is a pioneer if and only if Liam is a pioneer\". So who is a pioneer and who is a laggard? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Evelyn is a pioneer/laggard, and Liam is a pioneer/laggard>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Evelyn and Liam, considering the nature of pioneers and laggards.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - Evelyn's statement: \"If Evelyn is a pioneer, then Liam is a laggard.\"\n   - Liam's statement: \"Evelyn is a pioneer if and only if Liam is a pioneer.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing Evelyn's Statement:**\n   - If Evelyn is a pioneer (truth-teller), her statement must be true. Therefore, if Evelyn is a pioneer, Liam must be a laggard.\n   - If Evelyn is a laggard (liar), her statement is false. Therefore, if Evelyn is a laggard, Liam is not a laggard, meaning Liam is a pioneer.\n\n3. **Analyzing Liam's Statement:**\n   - If Liam is a pioneer (truth-teller), his statement must be true. Therefore, Evelyn is a pioneer if and only if Liam is a pioneer.\n   - If Liam is a laggard (liar), his statement is false. Therefore, Evelyn is a pioneer if and only if Liam is not a pioneer.\n\n4. **Considering Possible Scenarios:**\n   - **Scenario 1:** Evelyn is a pioneer.\n     - According to Evelyn's statement, if she is a pioneer, Liam must be a laggard.\n     - Check Liam's statement: If Liam is a laggard, his statement is false. Therefore, Evelyn is a pioneer if and only if Liam is not a pioneer, which is consistent because Liam is a laggard.\n     - This scenario is consistent.\n\n   - **Scenario 2:** Evelyn is a laggard.\n     - According to Evelyn's statement, if she is a laggard, Liam is a pioneer.\n     - Check Liam's statement: If Liam is a pioneer, his statement is true. Therefore, Evelyn is a pioneer if and only if Liam is a pioneer, which contradicts the assumption that Evelyn is a laggard.\n     - This scenario is inconsistent.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only consistent scenario is Scenario 1, where Evelyn is a pioneer and Liam is a laggard.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<Evelyn is a pioneer, and Liam is a laggard>>>"
