  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by pioneers and laggards. Pioneers always tell the truth, and laggards always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Matthew, and Ava. Matthew noted, \"Matthew is a pioneer if and only if Ava is a laggard\". Ava told you that if Matthew is a laggard then Matthew is a pioneer. So who is a pioneer and who is a laggard? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Matthew is a pioneer/laggard, and Ava is a pioneer/laggard>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Matthew and Ava, considering the nature of pioneers and laggards.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - Matthew says, \"Matthew is a pioneer if and only if Ava is a laggard.\"\n   - Ava says, \"If Matthew is a laggard, then Matthew is a pioneer.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing Matthew's Statement:**\n   - Matthew's statement is a biconditional statement: \"Matthew is a pioneer if and only if Ava is a laggard.\"\n   - This can be broken down into two parts:\n     - If Matthew is a pioneer, then Ava is a laggard.\n     - If Ava is a laggard, then Matthew is a pioneer.\n\n3. **Analyzing Ava's Statement:**\n   - Ava's statement is a conditional statement: \"If Matthew is a laggard, then Matthew is a pioneer.\"\n   - This statement is logically equivalent to saying \"Matthew is not a laggard,\" which implies \"Matthew is a pioneer.\"\n\n4. **Considering the Possibilities:**\n   - **Case 1: Matthew is a pioneer.**\n     - If Matthew is a pioneer, his statement must be true.\n     - Therefore, Ava must be a laggard.\n     - If Ava is a laggard, her statement is false, which is consistent because a laggard always lies.\n     - This scenario is consistent.\n\n   - **Case 2: Matthew is a laggard.**\n     - If Matthew is a laggard, his statement must be false.\n     - Therefore, it is not true that \"Matthew is a pioneer if and only if Ava is a laggard.\"\n     - This means either Matthew is not a pioneer, or Ava is not a laggard, or both.\n     - However, if Matthew is a laggard, Ava's statement \"If Matthew is a laggard, then Matthew is a pioneer\" would be true, which contradicts the fact that Ava is a laggard and should lie.\n     - This scenario is inconsistent.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only consistent scenario is Case 1, where Matthew is a pioneer and Ava is a laggard.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<Matthew is a pioneer, and Ava is a laggard>>>."
