  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Aria, and Zoey. Aria commented, \"Zoey is a knave or Zoey is a knight\". In a statement by Zoey: \"Aria is a knave and Aria is a knight\". So who is a knight and who is a knave? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Aria is a knight/knave, and Zoey is a knight/knave>>>)",
  "response_list": [
    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Aria and Zoey, considering the nature of knights and knaves.\n\n1. **Understanding Aria's Statement:**\n   - Aria says, \"Zoey is a knave or Zoey is a knight.\"\n   - This statement is a tautology because it covers all possibilities: Zoey can either be a knave or a knight. Therefore, this statement is always true regardless of Zoey's identity.\n   - Since Aria's statement is always true, Aria could be a knight (who always tells the truth) or a knave (who always lies), as this particular statement does not help us distinguish between the two.\n\n2. **Understanding Zoey's Statement:**\n   - Zoey says, \"Aria is a knave and Aria is a knight.\"\n   - This statement is a contradiction because Aria cannot be both a knave and a knight simultaneously.\n   - Since Zoey's statement is a contradiction, it is always false. Therefore, Zoey must be a knave (who always lies).\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Zoey is a knave, Aria's statement \"Zoey is a knave or Zoey is a knight\" is true, which is consistent with Aria being a knight.\n   - Therefore, Aria is a knight, and Zoey is a knave.\n\nThus, the final answer is: <<<Aria is a knight, and Zoey is a knave>>>."
