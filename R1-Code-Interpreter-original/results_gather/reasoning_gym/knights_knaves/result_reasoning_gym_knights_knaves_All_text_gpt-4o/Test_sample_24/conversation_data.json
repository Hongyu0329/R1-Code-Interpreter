  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by saints and sinners. Saints always tell the truth, and sinners always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Aria, and Jacob. \"Jacob is a saint\" - Aria. \"Aria is a sinner and Aria is a saint,\" Jacob declared. So who is a saint and who is a sinner? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Aria is a saint/sinner, and Jacob is a saint/sinner>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Aria and Jacob and determine who is a saint and who is a sinner. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Characters:**\n   - Saints always tell the truth.\n   - Sinners always lie.\n\n2. **Statements:**\n   - Aria says, \"Jacob is a saint.\"\n   - Jacob says, \"Aria is a sinner and Aria is a saint.\"\n\n3. **Analyzing Aria's Statement:**\n   - If Aria is a saint, then her statement \"Jacob is a saint\" must be true. Therefore, Jacob would also be a saint.\n   - If Aria is a sinner, then her statement \"Jacob is a saint\" must be false. Therefore, Jacob would be a sinner.\n\n4. **Analyzing Jacob's Statement:**\n   - Jacob's statement is a conjunction: \"Aria is a sinner and Aria is a saint.\"\n   - For a conjunction to be true, both parts must be true. However, \"Aria is a sinner and Aria is a saint\" is a contradiction because Aria cannot be both a sinner and a saint at the same time.\n   - Therefore, Jacob's statement is inherently false.\n\n5. **Determining Jacob's Nature:**\n   - Since Jacob's statement is false, Jacob must be a sinner (because saints always tell the truth).\n\n6. **Determining Aria's Nature:**\n   - Since Jacob is a sinner, Aria's statement \"Jacob is a saint\" is false.\n   - Therefore, Aria must be a sinner (because saints always tell the truth, and Aria's statement was false).\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - Both Aria and Jacob are sinners.\n\nThus, the final answer is: <<<Aria is a sinner, and Jacob is a sinner>>>."
