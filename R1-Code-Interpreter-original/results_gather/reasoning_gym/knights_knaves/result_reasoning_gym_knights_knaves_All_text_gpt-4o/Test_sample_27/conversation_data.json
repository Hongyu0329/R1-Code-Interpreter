  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by heros and villains. Heros always tell the truth, and villains always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: David, and Mia. David asserted: \"Mia is a hero\". In Mia's words: \"David is a hero or David is a villain\". So who is a hero and who is a villain? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<David is a hero/villain, and Mia is a hero/villain>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by David and Mia, considering the nature of heros and villains on the island.\n\n1. **David's Statement: \"Mia is a hero.\"**\n   - If David is a hero, he tells the truth. Therefore, Mia must be a hero.\n   - If David is a villain, he lies. Therefore, Mia must be a villain.\n\n2. **Mia's Statement: \"David is a hero or David is a villain.\"**\n   - This statement is a tautology because it covers all possibilities: David is either a hero or a villain. Therefore, this statement is always true regardless of Mia's nature.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1: David is a hero.**\n  - If David is a hero, his statement \"Mia is a hero\" must be true. Therefore, Mia is a hero.\n  - Mia's statement \"David is a hero or David is a villain\" is true, which is consistent because Mia is a hero and tells the truth.\n\n- **Scenario 2: David is a villain.**\n  - If David is a villain, his statement \"Mia is a hero\" must be false. Therefore, Mia is a villain.\n  - Mia's statement \"David is a hero or David is a villain\" is true, which is consistent because Mia is a villain and lies, but the statement is a tautology and always true.\n\nBoth scenarios are consistent with the nature of heros and villains. However, the key point is that Mia's statement is always true, regardless of whether she is a hero or a villain. Therefore, the determining factor is David's statement.\n\nSince both scenarios are logically consistent, we need to determine which scenario is possible given the constraints:\n\n- If David is a hero, Mia must be a hero.\n- If David is a villain, Mia must be a villain.\n\nSince both scenarios are logically consistent, we conclude that David and Mia must be of the same type. Therefore, the only consistent solution is:\n\n<<<David is a hero, and Mia is a hero>>>"
