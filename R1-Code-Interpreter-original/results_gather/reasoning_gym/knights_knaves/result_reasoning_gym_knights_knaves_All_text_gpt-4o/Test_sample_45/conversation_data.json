  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by angels and devils. Angels always tell the truth, and devils always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Benjamin, and Emma. In Benjamin's words: \"Emma is a devil if and only if Emma is an angel\". \"Benjamin is a devil,\" Emma mentioned. So who is an angel and who is a devil? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Benjamin is a angel/devil, and Emma is a angel/devil>>>)",
  "response_list": [
    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Benjamin and Emma, considering the nature of angels and devils on the island.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - Benjamin says: \"Emma is a devil if and only if Emma is an angel.\"\n   - Emma says: \"Benjamin is a devil.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing Benjamin's Statement:**\n   - The statement \"Emma is a devil if and only if Emma is an angel\" is a logical contradiction. An individual cannot be both a devil and an angel simultaneously. Therefore, this statement is inherently false.\n   - Since Benjamin's statement is false, Benjamin must be a devil (because devils always lie).\n\n3. **Analyzing Emma's Statement:**\n   - Emma says, \"Benjamin is a devil.\"\n   - Since we have determined that Benjamin is indeed a devil, Emma's statement is true.\n   - Therefore, Emma must be an angel (because angels always tell the truth).\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Benjamin is a devil because his statement is false.\n   - Emma is an angel because her statement is true.\n\nThus, the final answer is: <<<Benjamin is a devil, and Emma is an angel>>>."
