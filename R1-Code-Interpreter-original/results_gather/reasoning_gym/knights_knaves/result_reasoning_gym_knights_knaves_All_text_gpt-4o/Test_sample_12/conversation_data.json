  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by saints and sinners. Saints always tell the truth, and sinners always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Samuel, and Jacob. Samuel expressed that if Samuel is a saint then Jacob is a sinner. Jacob was heard saying, \"if Samuel is a saint then Samuel is a sinner\". So who is a saint and who is a sinner? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Samuel is a saint/sinner, and Jacob is a saint/sinner>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Samuel and Jacob, considering the nature of saints and sinners on the island.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - Samuel says: \"If Samuel is a saint, then Jacob is a sinner.\"\n   - Jacob says: \"If Samuel is a saint, then Samuel is a sinner.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing Samuel's Statement:**\n   - Samuel's statement is a conditional statement: \"If Samuel is a saint, then Jacob is a sinner.\"\n   - If Samuel is a saint (truth-teller), his statement must be true. Therefore, Jacob must be a sinner.\n   - If Samuel is a sinner (liar), his statement is false. The negation of his statement is: \"Samuel is a saint and Jacob is a saint.\"\n\n3. **Analyzing Jacob's Statement:**\n   - Jacob's statement is: \"If Samuel is a saint, then Samuel is a sinner.\"\n   - If Jacob is a saint (truth-teller), his statement must be true. However, the statement \"If Samuel is a saint, then Samuel is a sinner\" is a contradiction because a saint cannot be a sinner. Therefore, Jacob cannot be a saint.\n   - If Jacob is a sinner (liar), his statement is false. The negation of his statement is: \"Samuel is a saint and Samuel is not a sinner,\" which is consistent because a saint cannot be a sinner.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - From Jacob's analysis, we conclude that Jacob must be a sinner because his statement cannot be true.\n   - From Samuel's analysis, if Samuel is a saint, Jacob is a sinner, which is consistent with our conclusion from Jacob's analysis.\n   - Therefore, Samuel is a saint, and Jacob is a sinner.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Samuel is a saint, and Jacob is a sinner>>>."
