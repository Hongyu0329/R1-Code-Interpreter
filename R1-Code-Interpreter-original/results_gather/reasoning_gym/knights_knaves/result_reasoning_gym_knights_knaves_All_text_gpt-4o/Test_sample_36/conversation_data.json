  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by sages and fools. Sages always tell the truth, and fools always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Abigail, and David. As Abigail put it, \"David is a sage if and only if David is a fool\". David said that Abigail is a fool. So who is a sage and who is a fool? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Abigail is a sage/fool, and David is a sage/fool>>>)",
  "response_list": [
    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Abigail and David, considering the nature of sages and fools on the island.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - Abigail says: \"David is a sage if and only if David is a fool.\"\n   - David says: \"Abigail is a fool.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing Abigail's Statement:**\n   - The statement \"David is a sage if and only if David is a fool\" is a logical contradiction because someone cannot be both a sage and a fool simultaneously. Therefore, Abigail's statement is inherently false.\n   - Since sages always tell the truth and fools always lie, Abigail must be a fool because she made a false statement.\n\n3. **Analyzing David's Statement:**\n   - David says that \"Abigail is a fool.\"\n   - We have already determined that Abigail is indeed a fool.\n   - Since David's statement is true, David must be a sage because only sages tell the truth.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Abigail is a fool because her statement was false.\n   - David is a sage because his statement was true.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: <<<Abigail is a fool, and David is a sage>>>."
