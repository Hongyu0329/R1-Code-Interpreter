  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by heros and villains. Heros always tell the truth, and villains always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Lily, and Jack. As Lily put it, \"Lily is a hero or Jack is a villain\". Jack remarked, \"if Jack is a hero then Lily is a villain\". So who is a hero and who is a villain? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Lily is a hero/villain, and Jack is a hero/villain>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Lily and Jack, considering the nature of heros and villains on the island.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - Lily says: \"Lily is a hero or Jack is a villain.\"\n   - Jack says: \"If Jack is a hero then Lily is a villain.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing Lily's Statement:**\n   - Lily's statement is a logical \"or\" statement: \"Lily is a hero OR Jack is a villain.\"\n   - If Lily is a hero, her statement is true. Therefore, either Lily is a hero, or Jack is a villain, or both.\n   - If Lily is a villain, her statement is false. Therefore, neither Lily is a hero nor Jack is a villain. This means Lily is a villain and Jack is a hero.\n\n3. **Analyzing Jack's Statement:**\n   - Jack's statement is a conditional statement: \"If Jack is a hero, then Lily is a villain.\"\n   - If Jack is a hero, his statement must be true. Therefore, Lily must be a villain.\n   - If Jack is a villain, his statement is false. Therefore, Jack is a hero and Lily is not a villain, which means Lily is a hero.\n\n4. **Combining the Analysis:**\n   - Assume Lily is a hero:\n     - Lily's statement is true, so either Lily is a hero or Jack is a villain. Since we assumed Lily is a hero, this is consistent.\n     - Jack's statement must also be true if he is a hero. But if Jack is a hero, then Lily must be a villain, which contradicts our assumption that Lily is a hero.\n   - Therefore, Lily cannot be a hero.\n\n   - Assume Lily is a villain:\n     - Lily's statement is false, so neither Lily is a hero nor Jack is a villain. This means Jack is a hero.\n     - Jack's statement must be true if he is a hero. If Jack is a hero, then Lily must be a villain, which is consistent with our assumption.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only consistent scenario is that Lily is a villain and Jack is a hero.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<Lily is a villain, and Jack is a hero>>>."
