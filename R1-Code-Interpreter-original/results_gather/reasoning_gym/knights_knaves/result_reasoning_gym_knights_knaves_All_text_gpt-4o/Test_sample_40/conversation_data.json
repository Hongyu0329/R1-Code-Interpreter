  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by angels and devils. Angels always tell the truth, and devils always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Ava, and Benjamin. In Ava's words: \"if Benjamin is a devil then Benjamin is an angel\". Benjamin asserted: \"Ava is an angel and Ava is a devil\". So who is an angel and who is a devil? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Ava is a angel/devil, and Benjamin is a angel/devil>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Ava and Benjamin, keeping in mind that angels always tell the truth and devils always lie.\n\n1. **Ava's Statement: \"If Benjamin is a devil then Benjamin is an angel.\"**\n   - This is a conditional statement of the form \"If P then Q,\" where P is \"Benjamin is a devil\" and Q is \"Benjamin is an angel.\"\n   - For this statement to be true, either P must be false, or Q must be true (or both).\n   - If Ava is an angel (truth-teller), then her statement must be true. This means:\n     - If Benjamin is a devil (P is true), then Benjamin is an angel (Q is true), which is a contradiction. Therefore, P must be false, meaning Benjamin is not a devil, so Benjamin is an angel.\n   - If Ava is a devil (liar), then her statement must be false. This means:\n     - If Benjamin is a devil (P is true), then Benjamin is an angel (Q is false), which is consistent with Benjamin being a devil.\n\n2. **Benjamin's Statement: \"Ava is an angel and Ava is a devil.\"**\n   - This is a conjunction of two statements: \"Ava is an angel\" and \"Ava is a devil.\"\n   - For this statement to be true, both parts must be true simultaneously, which is impossible because Ava cannot be both an angel and a devil.\n   - If Benjamin is an angel (truth-teller), his statement must be true, but it cannot be true because it is a contradiction. Therefore, Benjamin cannot be an angel.\n   - If Benjamin is a devil (liar), his statement must be false. Since the statement is a contradiction, it is inherently false, which is consistent with Benjamin being a devil.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- From Ava's statement, if she is an angel, Benjamin must be an angel, which leads to a contradiction with Benjamin's statement.\n- From Benjamin's statement, he must be a devil because his statement is a contradiction.\n- Therefore, Ava must be an angel, as her statement being true leads to Benjamin being a devil, which is consistent.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n<<<Ava is an angel, and Benjamin is a devil>>>"
