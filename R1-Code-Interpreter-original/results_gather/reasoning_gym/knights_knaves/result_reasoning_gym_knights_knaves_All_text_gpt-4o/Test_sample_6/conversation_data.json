  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by angels and devils. Angels always tell the truth, and devils always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: James, and Liam. \"Liam is an angel or Liam is a devil\" - James. Liam remarked, \"James is an angel or James is a devil\". So who is an angel and who is a devil? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<James is a angel/devil, and Liam is a angel/devil>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by James and Liam, keeping in mind the characteristics of angels and devils:\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - James says, \"Liam is an angel or Liam is a devil.\"\n   - Liam says, \"James is an angel or James is a devil.\"\n\n2. **Characteristics of Angels and Devils:**\n   - Angels always tell the truth.\n   - Devils always lie.\n\n3. **Analyzing James's Statement:**\n   - James's statement is \"Liam is an angel or Liam is a devil.\"\n   - This statement is a tautology (always true) because it covers all possibilities for Liam's identity. Therefore, regardless of whether James is an angel or a devil, this statement is true.\n\n4. **Analyzing Liam's Statement:**\n   - Liam's statement is \"James is an angel or James is a devil.\"\n   - Similar to James's statement, this is also a tautology and is always true, covering all possibilities for James's identity.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Both statements are tautologies and are always true, regardless of who is an angel or a devil.\n   - Since both statements are true, James and Liam could both be angels, or one could be an angel and the other a devil. However, since devils always lie, and both statements are true, neither James nor Liam can be a devil.\n\n6. **Final Answer:**\n   - Both James and Liam must be angels because their statements are true, and devils cannot make true statements.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<James is an angel, and Liam is an angel>>>."
