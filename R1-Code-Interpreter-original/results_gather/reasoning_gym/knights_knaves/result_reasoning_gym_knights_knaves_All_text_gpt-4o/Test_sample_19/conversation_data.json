  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by sages and fools. Sages always tell the truth, and fools always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Abigail, and Lily. \"Lily is a sage,\" Abigail mentioned. As Lily put it, \"Abigail is a fool or Abigail is a sage\". So who is a sage and who is a fool? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Abigail is a sage/fool, and Lily is a sage/fool>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Abigail and Lily, considering the nature of sages and fools on the island.\n\n1. **Understanding the Characters:**\n   - Sages always tell the truth.\n   - Fools always lie.\n\n2. **Statements Analysis:**\n   - Abigail says, \"Lily is a sage.\"\n   - Lily says, \"Abigail is a fool or Abigail is a sage.\"\n\n3. **Analyzing Abigail's Statement:**\n   - If Abigail is a sage, then her statement \"Lily is a sage\" must be true. Therefore, Lily would also be a sage.\n   - If Abigail is a fool, then her statement \"Lily is a sage\" must be false. Therefore, Lily would be a fool.\n\n4. **Analyzing Lily's Statement:**\n   - Lily says, \"Abigail is a fool or Abigail is a sage.\"\n   - This statement is always true because it covers all possibilities (Abigail can only be a fool or a sage, there are no other options). Therefore, if Lily is a sage, she is telling the truth, and if she is a fool, she is lying, but the statement remains logically true regardless.\n\n5. **Logical Deduction:**\n   - If Lily is a sage, her statement is true, and Abigail can be either a fool or a sage. However, if Abigail is a sage, then Lily must be a sage (from Abigail's statement), which is consistent.\n   - If Lily is a fool, her statement is false, which means Abigail cannot be both a fool and a sage simultaneously. However, this doesn't help us directly because the statement is always true.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only consistent scenario is if Abigail is a sage and Lily is a sage. This satisfies both statements:\n     - Abigail's statement \"Lily is a sage\" is true.\n     - Lily's statement \"Abigail is a fool or Abigail is a sage\" is true, and since she is a sage, she tells the truth.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n<<<Abigail is a sage, and Lily is a sage>>>"
