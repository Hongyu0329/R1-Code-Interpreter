  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by altruists and egoists. Altruists always tell the truth, and egoists always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Scarlett, and Daniel. Scarlett stated, \"if Scarlett is an altruist then Daniel is an altruist\". In Daniel's words: \"Daniel is an altruist or Scarlett is an egoist\". So who is an altruist and who is an egoist? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Scarlett is a altruist/egoist, and Daniel is a altruist/egoist>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Scarlett and Daniel, considering the nature of altruists and egoists.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - Scarlett says: \"If Scarlett is an altruist, then Daniel is an altruist.\"\n   - Daniel says: \"Daniel is an altruist or Scarlett is an egoist.\"\n\n2. **Analyzing Scarlett's Statement:**\n   - If Scarlett is an altruist, she tells the truth. Therefore, her statement \"If Scarlett is an altruist, then Daniel is an altruist\" must be true. This implies that if Scarlett is an altruist, Daniel must also be an altruist.\n   - If Scarlett is an egoist, she lies. Therefore, her statement is false. The negation of her statement is: \"Scarlett is an altruist and Daniel is an egoist.\"\n\n3. **Analyzing Daniel's Statement:**\n   - If Daniel is an altruist, he tells the truth. Therefore, his statement \"Daniel is an altruist or Scarlett is an egoist\" must be true. This means either Daniel is an altruist, or Scarlett is an egoist, or both.\n   - If Daniel is an egoist, he lies. Therefore, his statement is false. The negation of his statement is: \"Daniel is an egoist and Scarlett is an altruist.\"\n\n4. **Evaluating Possible Scenarios:**\n   - **Scenario 1:** Scarlett is an altruist.\n     - Scarlett's statement is true, so Daniel must be an altruist.\n     - Daniel's statement is true because he is an altruist.\n     - This scenario is consistent.\n\n   - **Scenario 2:** Scarlett is an egoist.\n     - Scarlett's statement is false, so Scarlett is an altruist and Daniel is an egoist.\n     - Daniel's statement is false, so Daniel is an egoist and Scarlett is an altruist.\n     - This scenario is inconsistent because it leads to a contradiction.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only consistent scenario is Scenario 1, where Scarlett is an altruist and Daniel is an altruist.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<Scarlett is an altruist, and Daniel is an altruist>>>."
