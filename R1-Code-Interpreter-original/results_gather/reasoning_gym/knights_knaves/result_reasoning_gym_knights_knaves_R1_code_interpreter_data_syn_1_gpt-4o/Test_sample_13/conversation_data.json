  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by pioneers and laggards. Pioneers always tell the truth, and laggards always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Olivia, and Lily. \"Lily is a laggard and Lily is a pioneer\" - Olivia. Lily noted, \"if Olivia is a pioneer then Lily is a pioneer\". So who is a pioneer and who is a laggard? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Olivia is a pioneer/laggard, and Lily is a pioneer/laggard>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Olivia and Lily and determine who is telling the truth and who is lying.\n\n1. **Olivia's Statement**: \"Lily is a laggard and Lily is a pioneer.\"\n   - If Olivia is a pioneer (truth-teller), then her statement must be true. However, the statement \"Lily is a laggard and Lily is a pioneer\" is a contradiction because Lily cannot be both a laggard and a pioneer at the same time. Therefore, Olivia cannot be a pioneer.\n   - If Olivia is a laggard (liar), then her statement is false. This means that it is not true that \"Lily is a laggard and Lily is a pioneer.\" Since the statement is false, it implies that either \"Lily is not a laggard\" or \"Lily is not a pioneer\" or both.\n\n2. **Lily's Statement**: \"If Olivia is a pioneer then Lily is a pioneer.\"\n   - If Lily is a pioneer (truth-teller), then her statement must be true. However, we have already deduced that Olivia cannot be a pioneer, so the condition \"If Olivia is a pioneer\" is false, making the whole statement vacuously true.\n   - If Lily is a laggard (liar), then her statement is false. This means that \"If Olivia is a pioneer then Lily is a pioneer\" is false. Since Olivia cannot be a pioneer, this condition does not apply.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can conclude:\n- Olivia must be a laggard because her statement is a contradiction if she were a pioneer.\n- Lily must be a pioneer because her statement is vacuously true when Olivia is not a pioneer.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n<<<Olivia is a laggard, and Lily is a pioneer>>>"
