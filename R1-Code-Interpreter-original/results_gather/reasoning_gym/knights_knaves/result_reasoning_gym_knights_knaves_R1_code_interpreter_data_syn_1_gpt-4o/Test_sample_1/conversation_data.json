  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by saints and sinners. Saints always tell the truth, and sinners always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Elizabeth, and Ethan. \"Ethan is a sinner,\" Elizabeth declared. Ethan expressed that if Ethan is a saint then Elizabeth is a sinner. So who is a saint and who is a sinner? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Elizabeth is a saint/sinner, and Ethan is a saint/sinner>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Elizabeth and Ethan and determine their truthfulness based on the rules that saints always tell the truth and sinners always lie.\n\n1. **Elizabeth's Statement**: \"Ethan is a sinner.\"\n   - If Elizabeth is a saint, then her statement is true, and Ethan is indeed a sinner.\n   - If Elizabeth is a sinner, then her statement is false, and Ethan is a saint.\n\n2. **Ethan's Statement**: \"If Ethan is a saint, then Elizabeth is a sinner.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. Let's break it down:\n     - If Ethan is a saint, then the statement must be true (since saints always tell the truth), which means Elizabeth must be a sinner.\n     - If Ethan is a sinner, then the statement is false (since sinners always lie), which means the opposite of the statement is true: Ethan is not a saint, and Elizabeth is not a sinner, implying Elizabeth is a saint.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1**: Elizabeth is a saint.\n  - Her statement \"Ethan is a sinner\" is true.\n  - Ethan is a sinner.\n  - Ethan's statement \"If Ethan is a saint, then Elizabeth is a sinner\" is false because Ethan is not a saint.\n\n- **Scenario 2**: Elizabeth is a sinner.\n  - Her statement \"Ethan is a sinner\" is false.\n  - Ethan is a saint.\n  - Ethan's statement \"If Ethan is a saint, then Elizabeth is a sinner\" is true because Elizabeth is indeed a sinner.\n\nBoth scenarios are consistent with the rules, but we need to determine which one is correct. Let's use Python to verify the logic:\n\n```python\ndef check_statements():\n    # Scenario 1: Elizabeth is a saint\n    elizabeth_is_saint = True\n    ethan_is_sinner = True\n    ethan_statement_true = not ethan_is_sinner or not elizabeth_is_saint\n    if elizabeth_is_saint and ethan_is_sinner and not ethan_statement_true:\n        return \"Elizabeth is a saint, and Ethan is a sinner\"\n\n    # Scenario 2: Elizabeth is a sinner\n    elizabeth_is_saint = False\n    ethan_is_sinner = False\n    ethan_statement_true = not ethan_is_sinner or not elizabeth_is_saint\n    if not elizabeth_is_saint and not ethan_is_sinner and ethan_statement_true:\n        return \"Elizabeth is a sinner, and Ethan is a saint\"\n\n    return \"No consistent scenario found\"\n\nprint(check_statements())\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to determine the correct scenario.",
    "Based on the logical analysis and the code execution, the consistent scenario is that Elizabeth is a saint and Ethan is a sinner. This conclusion aligns with the rules that saints always tell the truth and sinners always lie.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Elizabeth is a saint, and Ethan is a sinner>>>"
