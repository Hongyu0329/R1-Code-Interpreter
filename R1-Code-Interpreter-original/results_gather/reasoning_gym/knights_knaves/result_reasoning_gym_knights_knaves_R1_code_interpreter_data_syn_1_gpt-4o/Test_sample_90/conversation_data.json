  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by sages and fools. Sages always tell the truth, and fools always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Evelyn, and Mia. Evelyn expressed that Mia is a sage and Mia is a fool. \"Evelyn is a sage or Evelyn is a fool\" - Mia. So who is a sage and who is a fool? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Evelyn is a sage/fool, and Mia is a sage/fool>>>)",
  "response_list": [
    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Evelyn and Mia and determine who is a sage and who is a fool.\n\n1. **Evelyn's Statement**: Evelyn says that Mia is a sage and Mia is a fool. This is a contradiction because someone cannot be both a sage and a fool at the same time. Therefore, Evelyn's statement cannot be true. Since sages always tell the truth, Evelyn must be a fool.\n\n2. **Mia's Statement**: Mia says, \"Evelyn is a sage or Evelyn is a fool.\" This statement is a tautology because it covers all possibilities. Therefore, Mia's statement is always true regardless of whether Mia is a sage or a fool. However, since Evelyn is a fool, Mia's statement being true indicates that Mia is a sage.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can conclude:\n- Evelyn is a fool.\n- Mia is a sage.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n<<<Evelyn is a fool, and Mia is a sage>>>"
