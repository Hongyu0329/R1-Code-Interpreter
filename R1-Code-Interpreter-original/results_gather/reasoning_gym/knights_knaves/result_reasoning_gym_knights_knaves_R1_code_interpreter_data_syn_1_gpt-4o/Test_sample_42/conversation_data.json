  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by saints and sinners. Saints always tell the truth, and sinners always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Joseph, and Lily. In Joseph's words: \"if Joseph is a saint then Lily is a sinner\". Lily stated, \"Joseph is a sinner\". So who is a saint and who is a sinner? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Joseph is a saint/sinner, and Lily is a saint/sinner>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Joseph and Lily and determine their truthfulness based on the rules that saints always tell the truth and sinners always lie.\n\n1. **Joseph's Statement**: \"If Joseph is a saint, then Lily is a sinner.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. In logic, a statement \"If A, then B\" is false only when A is true and B is false. In all other cases, it is true.\n\n2. **Lily's Statement**: \"Joseph is a sinner.\"\n   - This is a straightforward statement. If Lily is a saint, this statement is true. If Lily is a sinner, this statement is false.\n\nLet's analyze the possibilities:\n\n- **Case 1**: Joseph is a saint.\n  - If Joseph is a saint, his statement must be true. Therefore, \"If Joseph is a saint, then Lily is a sinner\" must be true. This implies Lily is a sinner.\n  - If Lily is a sinner, her statement \"Joseph is a sinner\" is false, which is consistent with Joseph being a saint.\n\n- **Case 2**: Joseph is a sinner.\n  - If Joseph is a sinner, his statement must be false. Therefore, \"If Joseph is a saint, then Lily is a sinner\" is false. This implies that Joseph being a saint and Lily being a sinner cannot both be true, which means Joseph is not a saint, and Lily is not a sinner.\n  - If Lily is not a sinner, she must be a saint. Therefore, her statement \"Joseph is a sinner\" is true, which is consistent with Joseph being a sinner.\n\nBoth cases are consistent with the rules of the island. However, only one scenario can be true. Let's verify this with a logical check using Python code.\n\n```python\ndef check_statements():\n    # Case 1: Assume Joseph is a saint\n    joseph_is_saint = True\n    lily_is_sinner = True  # From Joseph's statement if he is a saint\n    lily_statement = not joseph_is_saint  # Lily says Joseph is a sinner\n\n    if joseph_is_saint and lily_is_sinner and not lily_statement:\n        return \"Joseph is a saint, and Lily is a sinner\"\n\n    # Case 2: Assume Joseph is a sinner\n    joseph_is_saint = False\n    lily_is_saint = True  # From Lily's statement if she is a saint\n    joseph_statement = not (joseph_is_saint and not lily_is_saint)\n\n    if not joseph_is_saint and lily_is_saint and joseph_statement:\n        return \"Joseph is a sinner, and Lily is a saint\"\n\n    return \"No consistent solution found\"\n\nprint(check_statements())\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to determine the correct scenario.",
    "Based on the logical analysis and the code execution, the consistent scenario is that Joseph is a saint and Lily is a sinner. This conclusion aligns with the rules of the island, where saints always tell the truth and sinners always lie.\n\n<<<Joseph is a saint, and Lily is a sinner>>>"
