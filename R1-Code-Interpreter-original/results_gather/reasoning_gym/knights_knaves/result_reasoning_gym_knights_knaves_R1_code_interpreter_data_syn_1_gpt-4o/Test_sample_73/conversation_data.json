  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by saints and sinners. Saints always tell the truth, and sinners always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Michael, and Liam. \"Liam is a saint or Liam is a sinner,\" Michael declared. \"Michael is a sinner and Michael is a saint\" - Liam. So who is a saint and who is a sinner? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Michael is a saint/sinner, and Liam is a saint/sinner>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Michael and Liam.\n\n1. **Michael's Statement**: \"Liam is a saint or Liam is a sinner.\"\n   - This statement is always true because every inhabitant is either a saint or a sinner. Therefore, Michael's statement does not provide any information about his own nature. Both saints and sinners can make this statement.\n\n2. **Liam's Statement**: \"Michael is a sinner and Michael is a saint.\"\n   - This statement is a contradiction because no one can be both a sinner and a saint at the same time. Therefore, this statement is always false.\n\nSince Liam's statement is always false, Liam must be a sinner (because saints always tell the truth).\n\nNow, let's determine Michael's nature:\n- Since Liam is a sinner, his statement about Michael being both a sinner and a saint is false. This doesn't directly tell us about Michael's nature.\n- However, since Liam is a sinner, and his statement is false, it doesn't affect Michael's statement, which is always true regardless of whether Michael is a saint or a sinner.\n\nThus, Michael's nature cannot be determined solely based on the statements given, but we know for sure that Liam is a sinner.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is:\n<<<Michael's nature is undetermined, and Liam is a sinner>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    A very special island is inhabited only by saints and sinners.
