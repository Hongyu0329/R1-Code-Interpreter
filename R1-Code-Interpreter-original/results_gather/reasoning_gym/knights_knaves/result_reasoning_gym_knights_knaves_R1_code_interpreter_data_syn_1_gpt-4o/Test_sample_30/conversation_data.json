  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Aria, and Zoey. Aria commented, \"Zoey is a knave or Zoey is a knight\". In a statement by Zoey: \"Aria is a knave and Aria is a knight\". So who is a knight and who is a knave? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Aria is a knight/knave, and Zoey is a knight/knave>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Aria and Zoey and determine their truthfulness based on the rules of knights and knaves.\n\n1. **Aria's Statement**: \"Zoey is a knave or Zoey is a knight.\"\n   - This statement is a tautology because it covers all possibilities. Therefore, it is always true regardless of Zoey's identity. \n   - If Aria is a knight, she tells the truth, and her statement is true. If Aria is a knave, she lies, but her statement is still true because it is a tautology. This means Aria cannot be a knave because a knave cannot make a true statement.\n\n2. **Zoey's Statement**: \"Aria is a knave and Aria is a knight.\"\n   - This statement is a contradiction because Aria cannot be both a knave and a knight simultaneously.\n   - If Zoey is a knight, she tells the truth, but her statement is false because it is a contradiction. Therefore, Zoey cannot be a knight.\n   - If Zoey is a knave, she lies, and her statement is false, which is consistent with her being a knave.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can conclude:\n- Aria must be a knight because her statement is true.\n- Zoey must be a knave because her statement is false.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Aria is a knight, and Zoey is a knave>>>"
