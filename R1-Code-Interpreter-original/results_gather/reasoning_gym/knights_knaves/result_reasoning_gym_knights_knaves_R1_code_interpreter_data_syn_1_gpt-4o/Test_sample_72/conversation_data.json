  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by heros and villains. Heros always tell the truth, and villains always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Ethan, and Liam. As Ethan put it, \"Ethan is a hero if and only if Liam is a hero\". Liam said that if Liam is a hero then Ethan is a hero. So who is a hero and who is a villain? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Ethan is a hero/villain, and Liam is a hero/villain>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Ethan and Liam and determine their truthfulness based on the nature of heros and villains.\n\n1. **Ethan's Statement**: \"Ethan is a hero if and only if Liam is a hero.\"\n   - This is a biconditional statement, which means both Ethan and Liam are either both heros or both villains.\n\n2. **Liam's Statement**: \"If Liam is a hero then Ethan is a hero.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement, which means if Liam is a hero, then Ethan must also be a hero.\n\nLet's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1**: Ethan is a hero.\n  - If Ethan is a hero, his statement is true. Therefore, Liam must also be a hero.\n  - If Liam is a hero, his statement is also true, which is consistent with Ethan being a hero.\n\n- **Scenario 2**: Ethan is a villain.\n  - If Ethan is a villain, his statement is false. Therefore, Liam must be a hero.\n  - If Liam is a hero, his statement must be true, which contradicts Ethan being a villain.\n\nFrom the analysis, Scenario 2 leads to a contradiction. Therefore, Scenario 1 must be true, where both Ethan and Liam are heros.\n\nThus, the solution is that both Ethan and Liam are heros.\n\n<<<Ethan is a hero, and Liam is a hero>>>"
