  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by angels and devils. Angels always tell the truth, and devils always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Mason, and Sofia. Mason was heard saying, \"Mason is an angel if and only if Sofia is an angel\". Sofia asserted: \"Mason is a devil if and only if Sofia is an angel\". So who is an angel and who is a devil? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Mason is a angel/devil, and Sofia is a angel/devil>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Mason and Sofia and determine their truthfulness based on the nature of angels and devils.\n\n1. **Mason's Statement**: \"Mason is an angel if and only if Sofia is an angel.\"\n   - This is a logical biconditional statement. It means that both Mason and Sofia are either both angels or both devils.\n\n2. **Sofia's Statement**: \"Mason is a devil if and only if Sofia is an angel.\"\n   - This is another logical biconditional statement. It means that Mason is a devil if Sofia is an angel, and Mason is an angel if Sofia is a devil.\n\nLet's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1**: Mason is an angel.\n  - If Mason is an angel, his statement must be true. Therefore, Sofia must also be an angel.\n  - If Sofia is an angel, her statement must also be true. However, her statement \"Mason is a devil if and only if Sofia is an angel\" would imply Mason is a devil, which contradicts our assumption that Mason is an angel. Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\n- **Scenario 2**: Mason is a devil.\n  - If Mason is a devil, his statement must be false. Therefore, it is not true that both Mason and Sofia are either both angels or both devils. This means one is an angel and the other is a devil.\n  - If Sofia is an angel, her statement must be true. Her statement \"Mason is a devil if and only if Sofia is an angel\" is consistent with this scenario because Mason is indeed a devil.\n  - Therefore, this scenario is consistent.\n\nThus, the only consistent scenario is that Mason is a devil and Sofia is an angel.\n\n<<<Mason is a devil, and Sofia is an angel>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    A very special island is inhabited only by angels and devils.
