  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by angels and devils. Angels always tell the truth, and devils always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Emma, and Jackson. Emma said, \"Jackson is an angel if and only if Emma is an angel.\" Jackson remarked, \"Emma is an angel\". So who is an angel and who is a devil? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Emma is a angel/devil, and Jackson is a angel/devil>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Emma and Jackson and determine their truthfulness based on the nature of angels and devils.\n\n1. **Emma's Statement**: \"Jackson is an angel if and only if Emma is an angel.\"\n   - This is a biconditional statement, which means both parts must be true or both must be false.\n   - If Emma is an angel (truth-teller), then her statement is true, which implies Jackson is also an angel.\n   - If Emma is a devil (liar), then her statement is false, which implies Jackson is not an angel (i.e., Jackson is a devil).\n\n2. **Jackson's Statement**: \"Emma is an angel.\"\n   - If Jackson is an angel (truth-teller), then his statement is true, which implies Emma is an angel.\n   - If Jackson is a devil (liar), then his statement is false, which implies Emma is not an angel (i.e., Emma is a devil).\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1**: Assume Emma is an angel.\n  - Emma's statement is true, so Jackson must be an angel.\n  - Jackson's statement is true, so Emma is indeed an angel.\n  - This scenario is consistent.\n\n- **Scenario 2**: Assume Emma is a devil.\n  - Emma's statement is false, so Jackson must be a devil.\n  - Jackson's statement is false, so Emma is indeed a devil.\n  - This scenario is also consistent.\n\nBoth scenarios are logically consistent, but we need to determine which one is correct. Since both scenarios are possible, we need to check if there's any contradiction or additional information that can help us decide.\n\nLet's use Python to verify these scenarios:\n\n```python\ndef check_statements():\n    # Scenario 1: Emma is an angel\n    emma_is_angel = True\n    jackson_is_angel = emma_is_angel  # Based on Emma's statement\n    jackson_statement = emma_is_angel  # Jackson's statement\n\n    scenario_1_valid = jackson_is_angel == jackson_statement\n\n    # Scenario 2: Emma is a devil\n    emma_is_angel = False\n    jackson_is_angel = emma_is_angel  # Based on Emma's statement\n    jackson_statement = emma_is_angel  # Jackson's statement\n\n    scenario_2_valid = jackson_is_angel != jackson_statement\n\n    return scenario_1_valid, scenario_2_valid\n\nprint(check_statements())\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to see which scenario is valid.",
    "The code output indicates that Scenario 1 is valid, while Scenario 2 is not. This means that the consistent scenario is where Emma is an angel and Jackson is also an angel. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Emma is an angel, and Jackson is an angel>>>"
