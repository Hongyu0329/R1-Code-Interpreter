  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by angels and devils. Angels always tell the truth, and devils always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Ava, and Benjamin. In Ava's words: \"if Benjamin is a devil then Benjamin is an angel\". Benjamin asserted: \"Ava is an angel and Ava is a devil\". So who is an angel and who is a devil? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Ava is a angel/devil, and Benjamin is a angel/devil>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Ava and Benjamin, considering the nature of angels and devils.\n\n1. **Ava's Statement**: \"If Benjamin is a devil then Benjamin is an angel.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. For a truth-teller (angel), this statement can only be true if the premise is false or the conclusion is true. \n   - If Ava is an angel, then the statement must be true. The only way for \"If Benjamin is a devil then Benjamin is an angel\" to be true is if Benjamin is not a devil (because a devil cannot be an angel). Therefore, if Ava is an angel, Benjamin must be an angel.\n   - If Ava is a devil, then the statement is false. The statement \"If Benjamin is a devil then Benjamin is an angel\" is false if Benjamin is a devil (making the premise true) and Benjamin is not an angel (making the conclusion false). Therefore, if Ava is a devil, Benjamin must be a devil.\n\n2. **Benjamin's Statement**: \"Ava is an angel and Ava is a devil.\"\n   - This is a contradiction. An angel cannot be both an angel and a devil at the same time.\n   - If Benjamin is an angel, his statement must be true, which is impossible because it is a contradiction. Therefore, Benjamin cannot be an angel.\n   - If Benjamin is a devil, his statement is false, which is consistent with the nature of devils. Therefore, Benjamin must be a devil.\n\nFrom the analysis above:\n- If Benjamin is a devil, Ava's statement \"If Benjamin is a devil then Benjamin is an angel\" is false, which means Ava is a devil.\n- Benjamin's statement being false confirms that Benjamin is a devil.\n\nThus, both Ava and Benjamin are devils.\n\n<<<Ava is a devil, and Benjamin is a devil>>>"
