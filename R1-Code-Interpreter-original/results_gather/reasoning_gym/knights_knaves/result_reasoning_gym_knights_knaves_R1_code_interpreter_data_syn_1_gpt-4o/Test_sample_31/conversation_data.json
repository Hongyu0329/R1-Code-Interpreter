  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by angels and devils. Angels always tell the truth, and devils always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Daniel, and Ethan. According to Daniel, \"if Ethan is an angel then Ethan is a devil\". According to Ethan, \"Daniel is an angel if and only if Daniel is a devil\". So who is an angel and who is a devil? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Daniel is a angel/devil, and Ethan is a angel/devil>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Daniel and Ethan and determine their truthfulness based on the nature of angels and devils.\n\n1. **Daniel's Statement**: \"If Ethan is an angel, then Ethan is a devil.\"\n   - This is a contradiction. If Ethan is an angel, he cannot be a devil. Therefore, if Daniel is telling the truth (i.e., Daniel is an angel), then Ethan cannot be an angel. Hence, Ethan must be a devil.\n   - If Daniel is lying (i.e., Daniel is a devil), then the statement \"If Ethan is an angel, then Ethan is a devil\" is false. This means Ethan is an angel.\n\n2. **Ethan's Statement**: \"Daniel is an angel if and only if Daniel is a devil.\"\n   - This is also a contradiction. Daniel cannot be both an angel and a devil at the same time. Therefore, if Ethan is telling the truth (i.e., Ethan is an angel), then the statement is false, which is a contradiction. Hence, Ethan cannot be an angel.\n   - If Ethan is lying (i.e., Ethan is a devil), then the statement \"Daniel is an angel if and only if Daniel is a devil\" is false, which is consistent with Ethan being a devil.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can conclude:\n- If Daniel is an angel, then Ethan must be a devil (since Daniel's statement would be true only if Ethan is a devil).\n- If Ethan is a devil, then his statement is false, which is consistent with Daniel being an angel.\n\nTherefore, the only consistent scenario is that Daniel is an angel and Ethan is a devil.\n\n<<<Daniel is an angel, and Ethan is a devil>>>"
