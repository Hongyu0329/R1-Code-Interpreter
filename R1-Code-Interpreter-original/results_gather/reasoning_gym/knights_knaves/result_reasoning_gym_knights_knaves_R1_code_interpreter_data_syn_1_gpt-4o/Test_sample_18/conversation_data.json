  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by altruists and egoists. Altruists always tell the truth, and egoists always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Riley, and Lily. Riley commented, \"Riley is an altruist if and only if Lily is an altruist\". In Lily's words: \"Riley is an egoist\". So who is an altruist and who is an egoist? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Riley is a altruist/egoist, and Lily is a altruist/egoist>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Riley and Lily, considering the nature of altruists and egoists.\n\n1. **Riley's Statement**: \"Riley is an altruist if and only if Lily is an altruist.\"\n   - This is a biconditional statement, which means both parts must be true or both must be false.\n   - If Riley is an altruist (truth-teller), then the statement is true, meaning Lily must also be an altruist.\n   - If Riley is an egoist (liar), then the statement is false, meaning one of them is an altruist and the other is an egoist.\n\n2. **Lily's Statement**: \"Riley is an egoist.\"\n   - If Lily is an altruist, then her statement is true, meaning Riley is an egoist.\n   - If Lily is an egoist, then her statement is false, meaning Riley is an altruist.\n\nLet's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1**: Riley is an altruist.\n  - Riley's statement is true, so Lily must be an altruist.\n  - But if Lily is an altruist, her statement \"Riley is an egoist\" would be false, which contradicts Riley being an altruist.\n\n- **Scenario 2**: Riley is an egoist.\n  - Riley's statement is false, meaning one of them is an altruist and the other is an egoist.\n  - If Lily is an altruist, her statement \"Riley is an egoist\" is true, which is consistent with Riley being an egoist.\n\nThus, the only consistent scenario is that Riley is an egoist and Lily is an altruist.\n\n<<<Riley is an egoist, and Lily is an altruist>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    A very special island is inhabited only by altruists and egoists.
