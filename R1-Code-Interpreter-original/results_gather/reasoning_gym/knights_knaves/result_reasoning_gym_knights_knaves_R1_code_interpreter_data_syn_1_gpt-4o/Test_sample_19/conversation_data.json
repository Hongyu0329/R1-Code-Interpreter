  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by sages and fools. Sages always tell the truth, and fools always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Abigail, and Lily. \"Lily is a sage,\" Abigail mentioned. As Lily put it, \"Abigail is a fool or Abigail is a sage\". So who is a sage and who is a fool? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Abigail is a sage/fool, and Lily is a sage/fool>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Abigail and Lily, considering the nature of sages and fools.\n\n1. **Abigail's Statement**: \"Lily is a sage.\"\n   - If Abigail is a sage, then her statement is true, which means Lily is indeed a sage.\n   - If Abigail is a fool, then her statement is false, which means Lily is not a sage (i.e., Lily is a fool).\n\n2. **Lily's Statement**: \"Abigail is a fool or Abigail is a sage.\"\n   - This statement is a tautology (always true) because it covers all possibilities. Therefore, it doesn't provide direct information about Lily's nature based on the truth value of the statement itself.\n\nLet's analyze the possibilities:\n\n- **Case 1**: Assume Abigail is a sage.\n  - Then her statement \"Lily is a sage\" is true, so Lily is a sage.\n  - Lily's statement \"Abigail is a fool or Abigail is a sage\" is true (as it is always true), which is consistent with Lily being a sage.\n\n- **Case 2**: Assume Abigail is a fool.\n  - Then her statement \"Lily is a sage\" is false, so Lily is a fool.\n  - Lily's statement \"Abigail is a fool or Abigail is a sage\" is true (as it is always true), which is consistent with Lily being a fool.\n\nBoth cases are consistent with the statements made. However, the tautological nature of Lily's statement means it doesn't help us distinguish between the two cases. Therefore, we need to rely on the logical consistency of the statements:\n\n- If Abigail is a sage, then Lily must be a sage.\n- If Abigail is a fool, then Lily must be a fool.\n\nSince both scenarios are logically consistent, we can conclude that Abigail is a sage and Lily is a sage. This is because the statement \"Abigail is a fool or Abigail is a sage\" is always true, and the only way for both statements to be consistent is if both are sages.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Abigail is a sage, and Lily is a sage>>>"
