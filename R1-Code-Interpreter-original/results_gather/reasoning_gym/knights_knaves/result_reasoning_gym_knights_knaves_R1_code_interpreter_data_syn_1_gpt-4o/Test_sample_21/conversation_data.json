  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by sages and fools. Sages always tell the truth, and fools always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Ethan, and Noah. In a statement by Ethan: \"Noah is a fool and Noah is a sage\". Noah was heard saying, \"if Ethan is a sage then Ethan is a fool\". So who is a sage and who is a fool? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Ethan is a sage/fool, and Noah is a sage/fool>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Ethan and Noah and determine their truthfulness based on the characteristics of sages and fools.\n\n1. **Ethan's Statement**: \"Noah is a fool and Noah is a sage.\"\n   - This statement is a contradiction because it claims that Noah is both a fool and a sage simultaneously, which is impossible. Therefore, Ethan's statement must be false.\n\n2. **Noah's Statement**: \"If Ethan is a sage then Ethan is a fool.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. Let's analyze it:\n     - If Ethan is a sage, then the statement \"Ethan is a fool\" must be true for Noah's statement to be true. However, this creates a contradiction because a sage cannot be a fool.\n     - Therefore, if Ethan is a sage, Noah's statement is false.\n     - If Ethan is a fool, then the statement \"Ethan is a sage\" is false, making the entire conditional statement true (since a false antecedent makes the conditional true).\n\nFrom the analysis:\n- Ethan's statement is false, which means Ethan is a fool (since only fools lie).\n- Noah's statement is structured such that it is true if Ethan is a fool. Since Ethan is indeed a fool, Noah's statement is true, indicating that Noah is a sage (since only sages tell the truth).\n\nThus, the conclusion is:\n<<<Ethan is a fool, and Noah is a sage>>>"
