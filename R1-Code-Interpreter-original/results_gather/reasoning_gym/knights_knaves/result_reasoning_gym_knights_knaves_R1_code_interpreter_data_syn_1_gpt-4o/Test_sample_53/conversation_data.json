  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by angels and devils. Angels always tell the truth, and devils always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Matthew, and Logan. In a statement by Matthew: \"Matthew is an angel and Logan is a devil\". \"Matthew is an angel\" - Logan. So who is an angel and who is a devil? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Matthew is a angel/devil, and Logan is a angel/devil>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Matthew and Logan, considering the nature of angels and devils.\n\n1. **Matthew's Statement**: \"Matthew is an angel and Logan is a devil.\"\n   - If Matthew is an angel, then his statement is true. This would mean Matthew is indeed an angel, and Logan is a devil.\n   - If Matthew is a devil, then his statement is false. This would mean Matthew is not an angel, and Logan is not a devil (i.e., Logan is an angel).\n\n2. **Logan's Statement**: \"Matthew is an angel.\"\n   - If Logan is an angel, then his statement is true. This would mean Matthew is indeed an angel.\n   - If Logan is a devil, then his statement is false. This would mean Matthew is not an angel.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1**: Matthew is an angel.\n  - Matthew's statement is true: Matthew is an angel, and Logan is a devil.\n  - Logan's statement is true: Matthew is an angel.\n  - This scenario is consistent because both statements align with the nature of angels and devils.\n\n- **Scenario 2**: Matthew is a devil.\n  - Matthew's statement is false: Matthew is not an angel, and Logan is not a devil (i.e., Logan is an angel).\n  - Logan's statement is false: Matthew is not an angel.\n  - This scenario is inconsistent because if Logan is an angel, his statement should be true.\n\nFrom the analysis, only Scenario 1 is consistent. Therefore, Matthew is an angel, and Logan is a devil.\n\n<<<Matthew is an angel, and Logan is a devil>>>"
