  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Aiden, and Sophia. \"if Aiden is a knight then Sophia is a knave,\" Aiden claimed. \"Sophia is a knight and Aiden is a knight\" - Sophia. So who is a knight and who is a knave? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Aiden is a knight/knave, and Sophia is a knight/knave>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Aiden and Sophia and determine their truthfulness based on the rules of knights and knaves.\n\n1. **Aiden's Statement**: \"If Aiden is a knight, then Sophia is a knave.\"\n   - If Aiden is a knight, then his statement must be true. Therefore, Sophia must be a knave.\n   - If Aiden is a knave, then his statement is false. Therefore, the opposite must be true: if Aiden is a knight, then Sophia is a knight.\n\n2. **Sophia's Statement**: \"Sophia is a knight and Aiden is a knight.\"\n   - If Sophia is a knight, then her statement must be true. Therefore, both Sophia and Aiden are knights.\n   - If Sophia is a knave, then her statement is false. Therefore, at least one of them is not a knight.\n\nLet's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1**: Aiden is a knight.\n  - If Aiden is a knight, then according to his statement, Sophia must be a knave.\n  - However, if Sophia is a knave, her statement \"Sophia is a knight and Aiden is a knight\" is false, which is consistent because she is a knave.\n\n- **Scenario 2**: Aiden is a knave.\n  - If Aiden is a knave, then his statement is false. Therefore, if Aiden is a knight, Sophia is a knight.\n  - However, if Sophia is a knight, her statement \"Sophia is a knight and Aiden is a knight\" must be true, which contradicts the assumption that Aiden is a knave.\n\nFrom the analysis, Scenario 1 is consistent, while Scenario 2 leads to a contradiction. Therefore, Aiden is a knight, and Sophia is a knave.\n\n<<<Aiden is a knight, and Sophia is a knave>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves.
