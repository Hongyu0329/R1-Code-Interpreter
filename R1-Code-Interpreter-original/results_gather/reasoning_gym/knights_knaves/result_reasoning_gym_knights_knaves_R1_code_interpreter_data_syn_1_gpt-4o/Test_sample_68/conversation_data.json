  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by angels and devils. Angels always tell the truth, and devils always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Ethan, and Oliver. As Ethan put it, \"if Oliver is a devil then Oliver is an angel\". In Oliver's words: \"Ethan is an angel if and only if Oliver is an angel\". So who is an angel and who is a devil? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Ethan is a angel/devil, and Oliver is a angel/devil>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Ethan and Oliver, considering the nature of angels and devils.\n\n1. **Ethan's Statement**: \"If Oliver is a devil then Oliver is an angel.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. For this statement to be true, the premise (Oliver is a devil) must lead to the conclusion (Oliver is an angel). This is a contradiction because a devil cannot be an angel. Therefore, the only way for Ethan's statement to be true is if the premise is false, meaning Oliver is not a devil, i.e., Oliver is an angel. If Ethan is an angel, his statement must be true, which implies Oliver is an angel.\n\n2. **Oliver's Statement**: \"Ethan is an angel if and only if Oliver is an angel.\"\n   - This is a biconditional statement. It means both parts must be true or both must be false. If Oliver is an angel, then Ethan must be an angel for the statement to be true. If Oliver is a devil, then Ethan must be a devil for the statement to be true.\n\nLet's analyze the possibilities:\n\n- **Case 1**: Assume Ethan is an angel.\n  - Ethan's statement must be true, so Oliver is an angel.\n  - If Oliver is an angel, then Oliver's statement must be true, which means Ethan is an angel. This is consistent.\n\n- **Case 2**: Assume Ethan is a devil.\n  - Ethan's statement must be false, so Oliver is not an angel, i.e., Oliver is a devil.\n  - If Oliver is a devil, then Oliver's statement must be false. For the statement \"Ethan is an angel if and only if Oliver is an angel\" to be false, one part must be true and the other false. Since Oliver is a devil, the statement \"Oliver is an angel\" is false, so \"Ethan is an angel\" must be true. This is a contradiction because we assumed Ethan is a devil.\n\nFrom the analysis, Case 1 is consistent, and Case 2 leads to a contradiction. Therefore, Ethan is an angel, and Oliver is an angel.\n\n<<<Ethan is an angel, and Oliver is an angel>>>"
