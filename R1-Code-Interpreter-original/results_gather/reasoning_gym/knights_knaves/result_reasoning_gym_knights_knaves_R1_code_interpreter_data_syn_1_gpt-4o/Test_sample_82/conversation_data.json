  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by heros and villains. Heros always tell the truth, and villains always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Harper, and Jackson. Harper noted, \"Jackson is a hero\". According to Jackson, \"Harper is a hero or Harper is a villain\". So who is a hero and who is a villain? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Harper is a hero/villain, and Jackson is a hero/villain>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Harper and Jackson, considering the nature of heros and villains on the island.\n\n1. **Harper's Statement**: \"Jackson is a hero.\"\n   - If Harper is a hero, then Harper tells the truth, which means Jackson is indeed a hero.\n   - If Harper is a villain, then Harper lies, which means Jackson is not a hero (i.e., Jackson is a villain).\n\n2. **Jackson's Statement**: \"Harper is a hero or Harper is a villain.\"\n   - This statement is a tautology because it covers all possibilities (everyone is either a hero or a villain). Therefore, this statement is always true regardless of whether Jackson is a hero or a villain.\n\nNow, let's analyze the scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1**: Harper is a hero.\n  - If Harper is a hero, then Harper's statement \"Jackson is a hero\" is true. Therefore, Jackson must be a hero.\n  - Jackson's statement is true regardless of his nature, so it doesn't contradict anything.\n\n- **Scenario 2**: Harper is a villain.\n  - If Harper is a villain, then Harper's statement \"Jackson is a hero\" is false. Therefore, Jackson must be a villain.\n  - Jackson's statement is still true regardless of his nature, so it doesn't contradict anything.\n\nIn both scenarios, Jackson's statement does not help us determine his nature because it is always true. Therefore, the key lies in Harper's statement.\n\nLet's summarize:\n- If Harper is a hero, then Jackson is a hero.\n- If Harper is a villain, then Jackson is a villain.\n\nSince both scenarios are consistent with the rules of the island, we need to determine which scenario is logically possible. The only consistent scenario is that Harper is a hero and Jackson is a hero, because if Harper were a villain, Jackson's statement would still be true, but it wouldn't help us determine anything new.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n<<<Harper is a hero, and Jackson is a hero>>>"
