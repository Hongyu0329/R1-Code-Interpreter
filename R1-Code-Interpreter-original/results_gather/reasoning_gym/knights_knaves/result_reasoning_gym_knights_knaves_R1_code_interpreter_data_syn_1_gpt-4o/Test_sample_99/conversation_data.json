  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by saints and sinners. Saints always tell the truth, and sinners always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Elizabeth, and Mason. \"Mason is a sinner\" - Elizabeth. Mason expressed that Elizabeth is a sinner and Elizabeth is a saint. So who is a saint and who is a sinner? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Elizabeth is a saint/sinner, and Mason is a saint/sinner>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Elizabeth and Mason.\n\n1. Elizabeth says, \"Mason is a sinner.\"\n2. Mason says, \"Elizabeth is a sinner and Elizabeth is a saint.\"\n\nLet's break down the possibilities:\n\n- If Elizabeth is a saint, then her statement \"Mason is a sinner\" must be true. Therefore, Mason is a sinner.\n- If Elizabeth is a sinner, then her statement \"Mason is a sinner\" must be false. Therefore, Mason is a saint.\n\nNow, let's analyze Mason's statement:\n\n- Mason says, \"Elizabeth is a sinner and Elizabeth is a saint.\" This is a contradictory statement because one person cannot be both a sinner and a saint at the same time. Therefore, Mason's statement is inherently false.\n\nGiven that Mason's statement is false, Mason must be a sinner (since only sinners lie). \n\nNow, let's verify:\n\n- If Mason is a sinner, then Elizabeth's statement \"Mason is a sinner\" is true, which means Elizabeth is a saint.\n\nTherefore, the logical conclusion is:\n\n- Elizabeth is a saint.\n- Mason is a sinner.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<Elizabeth is a saint, and Mason is a sinner>>>"
