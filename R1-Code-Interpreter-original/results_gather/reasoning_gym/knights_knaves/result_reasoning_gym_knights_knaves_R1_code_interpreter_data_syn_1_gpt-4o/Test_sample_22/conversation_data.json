  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by sages and fools. Sages always tell the truth, and fools always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Jacob, and Emma. Jacob noted, \"Emma is a sage if and only if Emma is a fool\". \"Jacob is a sage if and only if Jacob is a fool,\" Emma claimed. So who is a sage and who is a fool? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Jacob is a sage/fool, and Emma is a sage/fool>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Jacob and Emma.\n\n1. **Jacob's Statement**: \"Emma is a sage if and only if Emma is a fool.\"\n   - This statement is a contradiction because someone cannot be both a sage and a fool at the same time. Therefore, Jacob's statement is false.\n\n2. **Emma's Statement**: \"Jacob is a sage if and only if Jacob is a fool.\"\n   - This statement is also a contradiction for the same reason as above. Therefore, Emma's statement is false.\n\nNow, let's determine who is a sage and who is a fool based on the nature of their statements:\n\n- If Jacob is a sage, he would tell the truth. However, his statement is false, so Jacob cannot be a sage. Therefore, Jacob is a fool.\n- If Emma is a sage, she would tell the truth. However, her statement is false, so Emma cannot be a sage. Therefore, Emma is a fool.\n\nBoth Jacob and Emma are fools because their statements are false, and fools always lie.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n<<<Jacob is a fool, and Emma is a fool>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    A very special island is inhabited only by sages and fools.
