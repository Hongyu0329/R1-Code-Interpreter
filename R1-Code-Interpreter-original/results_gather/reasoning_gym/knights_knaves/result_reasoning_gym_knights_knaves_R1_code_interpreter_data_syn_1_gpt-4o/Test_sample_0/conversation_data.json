  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by saints and sinners. Saints always tell the truth, and sinners always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Scarlett, and Victoria. Scarlett noted, \"Victoria is a sinner if and only if Scarlett is a saint\". \"Victoria is a saint or Scarlett is a sinner,\" Victoria mentioned. So who is a saint and who is a sinner? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Scarlett is a saint/sinner, and Victoria is a saint/sinner>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Scarlett and Victoria and determine their truthfulness based on the nature of saints and sinners.\n\n1. **Scarlett's Statement**: \"Victoria is a sinner if and only if Scarlett is a saint.\"\n   - This is a biconditional statement, which means it is true if both parts are either true or false.\n   - If Scarlett is a saint (truth-teller), then her statement is true, which means Victoria is a sinner.\n   - If Scarlett is a sinner (liar), then her statement is false, which means Victoria is not a sinner, i.e., Victoria is a saint.\n\n2. **Victoria's Statement**: \"Victoria is a saint or Scarlett is a sinner.\"\n   - This is a disjunction, which is true if at least one of the parts is true.\n   - If Victoria is a saint (truth-teller), then her statement is true, which means either Victoria is a saint or Scarlett is a sinner.\n   - If Victoria is a sinner (liar), then her statement is false, which means neither Victoria is a saint nor Scarlett is a sinner, implying Scarlett is a saint.\n\nLet's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1**: Scarlett is a saint.\n  - Scarlett's statement is true: Victoria is a sinner.\n  - Victoria's statement: \"Victoria is a saint or Scarlett is a sinner\" must be false (since Victoria is a sinner), which contradicts Scarlett being a saint. Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\n- **Scenario 2**: Scarlett is a sinner.\n  - Scarlett's statement is false: Victoria is a saint.\n  - Victoria's statement: \"Victoria is a saint or Scarlett is a sinner\" is true (since Victoria is a saint), which is consistent with Victoria being a saint.\n\nThus, the only consistent scenario is that Scarlett is a sinner and Victoria is a saint.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script to verify the logic:\n\n```python\ndef check_statements():\n    # Scenario 1: Scarlett is a saint\n    scarlett_saint = True\n    victoria_sinner = True  # Based on Scarlett's statement\n    victoria_statement = victoria_sinner or not scarlett_saint\n    if scarlett_saint and not victoria_statement:\n        return \"Contradiction in Scenario 1\"\n\n    # Scenario 2: Scarlett is a sinner\n    scarlett_saint = False\n    victoria_saint = True  # Based on Scarlett's statement being false\n    victoria_statement = victoria_saint or not scarlett_saint\n    if not scarlett_saint and victoria_statement:\n        return \"Scarlett is a sinner, and Victoria is a saint\"\n\n    return \"No valid scenario found\"\n\nprint(check_statements())\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm the logical deduction.",
    "The code execution confirms our logical deduction. Based on the analysis and the code verification, the conclusion is:\n\n<<<Scarlett is a sinner, and Victoria is a saint>>>"
