  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by sages and fools. Sages always tell the truth, and fools always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Sebastian, and Benjamin. \"Benjamin is a fool,\" Sebastian declared. Benjamin remarked, \"Sebastian is a sage if and only if Benjamin is a sage\". So who is a sage and who is a fool? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Sebastian is a sage/fool, and Benjamin is a sage/fool>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Sebastian and Benjamin and determine their truthfulness based on the characteristics of sages and fools.\n\n1. **Sebastian's Statement**: \"Benjamin is a fool.\"\n   - If Sebastian is a sage, then his statement is true, and Benjamin is indeed a fool.\n   - If Sebastian is a fool, then his statement is false, and Benjamin is a sage.\n\n2. **Benjamin's Statement**: \"Sebastian is a sage if and only if Benjamin is a sage.\"\n   - This is a biconditional statement, which means both parts must be true or both must be false.\n   - If Benjamin is a sage, then his statement is true, which means Sebastian is also a sage.\n   - If Benjamin is a fool, then his statement is false, which means Sebastian is not a sage (i.e., Sebastian is a fool).\n\nLet's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1**: Assume Sebastian is a sage.\n  - Then, Sebastian's statement \"Benjamin is a fool\" is true.\n  - Therefore, Benjamin is a fool.\n  - If Benjamin is a fool, his statement must be false. The statement \"Sebastian is a sage if and only if Benjamin is a sage\" is false, which is consistent because Benjamin is a fool and Sebastian is a sage.\n\n- **Scenario 2**: Assume Sebastian is a fool.\n  - Then, Sebastian's statement \"Benjamin is a fool\" is false.\n  - Therefore, Benjamin is a sage.\n  - If Benjamin is a sage, his statement must be true. The statement \"Sebastian is a sage if and only if Benjamin is a sage\" is true, which is inconsistent because Benjamin is a sage and Sebastian is a fool.\n\nFrom the analysis, Scenario 1 is consistent, while Scenario 2 leads to a contradiction. Therefore, the only consistent scenario is that Sebastian is a sage and Benjamin is a fool.\n\n<<<Sebastian is a sage, and Benjamin is a fool>>>"
