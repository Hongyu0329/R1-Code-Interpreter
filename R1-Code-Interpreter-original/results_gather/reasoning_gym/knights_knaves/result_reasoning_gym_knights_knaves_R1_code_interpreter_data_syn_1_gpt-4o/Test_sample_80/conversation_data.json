  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Jackson, and Mason. In Jackson's words: \"Jackson is a knight or Mason is a knave\". \"Jackson is a knave if and only if Jackson is a knight,\" Mason declared. So who is a knight and who is a knave? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Jackson is a knight/knave, and Mason is a knight/knave>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Jackson and Mason and determine their truthfulness based on the rules of knights and knaves.\n\n1. **Jackson's Statement**: \"Jackson is a knight or Mason is a knave.\"\n   - If Jackson is a knight, then his statement is true. This means either Jackson is a knight (which is true) or Mason is a knave.\n   - If Jackson is a knave, then his statement is false. This means neither Jackson is a knight (which is true since he is a knave) nor Mason is a knave (meaning Mason is a knight).\n\n2. **Mason's Statement**: \"Jackson is a knave if and only if Jackson is a knight.\"\n   - This is a logical contradiction because a person cannot be both a knight and a knave simultaneously. Therefore, Mason's statement is false.\n   - If Mason is a knight, his statement would be true, which is not possible. Therefore, Mason must be a knave.\n\nLet's analyze the possibilities:\n\n- If Jackson is a knight, his statement \"Jackson is a knight or Mason is a knave\" is true. This means Mason can be a knave, which aligns with Mason's false statement. Thus, Jackson is a knight, and Mason is a knave.\n\n- If Jackson is a knave, his statement \"Jackson is a knight or Mason is a knave\" is false. This means Mason is a knight, which contradicts Mason's false statement. Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\nThus, the only consistent scenario is that Jackson is a knight and Mason is a knave.\n\n<<<Jackson is a knight, and Mason is a knave>>>"
