  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by saints and sinners. Saints always tell the truth, and sinners always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Aria, and Sofia. As Aria put it, \"Sofia is a saint\". \"Aria is a sinner or Aria is a saint,\" Sofia declared. So who is a saint and who is a sinner? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Aria is a saint/sinner, and Sofia is a saint/sinner>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Aria and Sofia and determine who is a saint and who is a sinner.\n\n1. **Aria's Statement**: \"Sofia is a saint.\"\n   - If Aria is a saint, then her statement is true, which means Sofia is a saint.\n   - If Aria is a sinner, then her statement is false, which means Sofia is a sinner.\n\n2. **Sofia's Statement**: \"Aria is a sinner or Aria is a saint.\"\n   - This statement is a tautology (always true) because it covers all possibilities. Therefore, it doesn't provide direct information about Sofia's nature based on the truth value of the statement alone.\n\nLet's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1**: Aria is a saint.\n  - If Aria is a saint, her statement \"Sofia is a saint\" must be true. Therefore, Sofia is also a saint.\n  - However, if both are saints, Sofia's statement \"Aria is a sinner or Aria is a saint\" is true, which is consistent with her being a saint.\n\n- **Scenario 2**: Aria is a sinner.\n  - If Aria is a sinner, her statement \"Sofia is a saint\" must be false. Therefore, Sofia is a sinner.\n  - If Sofia is a sinner, her statement \"Aria is a sinner or Aria is a saint\" is false, which contradicts the fact that the statement is always true.\n\nFrom the analysis, Scenario 2 leads to a contradiction, so it cannot be the case. Therefore, Scenario 1 must be true.\n\nThus, Aria is a saint, and Sofia is a saint.\n\n<<<Aria is a saint, and Sofia is a saint>>>"
