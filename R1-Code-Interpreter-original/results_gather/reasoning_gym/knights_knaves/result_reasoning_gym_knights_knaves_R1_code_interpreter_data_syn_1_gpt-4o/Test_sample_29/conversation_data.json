  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Sebastian, and Zoey. \"Zoey is a knight or Zoey is a knave,\" Sebastian claimed. Zoey remarked, \"Sebastian is a knight\". So who is a knight and who is a knave? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Sebastian is a knight/knave, and Zoey is a knight/knave>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Sebastian and Zoey, considering the nature of knights and knaves.\n\n1. **Sebastian's Statement**: \"Zoey is a knight or Zoey is a knave.\"\n   - This statement is a tautology because it covers all possible cases. Therefore, regardless of whether Sebastian is a knight or a knave, this statement is always true. This doesn't help us determine Sebastian's nature directly.\n\n2. **Zoey's Statement**: \"Sebastian is a knight.\"\n   - If Zoey is a knight, then her statement is true, which means Sebastian is indeed a knight.\n   - If Zoey is a knave, then her statement is false, which means Sebastian is not a knight (i.e., Sebastian is a knave).\n\nLet's analyze the possibilities:\n\n- **Case 1**: Assume Zoey is a knight.\n  - If Zoey is a knight, her statement \"Sebastian is a knight\" is true. Therefore, Sebastian is a knight.\n  - This scenario is consistent: Zoey is a knight, and Sebastian is a knight.\n\n- **Case 2**: Assume Zoey is a knave.\n  - If Zoey is a knave, her statement \"Sebastian is a knight\" is false. Therefore, Sebastian is a knave.\n  - This scenario is also consistent: Zoey is a knave, and Sebastian is a knave.\n\nNow, let's determine which scenario is possible:\n\n- In the first scenario, both are knights, which is consistent with the rules.\n- In the second scenario, both are knaves, which is not possible because a knave cannot truthfully claim to be a knave.\n\nTherefore, the only consistent scenario is the first one where both are knights.\n\n<<<Sebastian is a knight, and Zoey is a knight>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves.
