  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by angels and devils. Angels always tell the truth, and devils always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Benjamin, and Emma. In Benjamin's words: \"Emma is a devil if and only if Emma is an angel\". \"Benjamin is a devil,\" Emma mentioned. So who is an angel and who is a devil? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Benjamin is a angel/devil, and Emma is a angel/devil>>>)",
  "response_list": [
    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Benjamin and Emma.\n\n1. **Benjamin's Statement**: \"Emma is a devil if and only if Emma is an angel.\"\n   - This statement is a logical contradiction because it states that Emma is a devil if and only if she is an angel, which is impossible. Therefore, Benjamin must be lying, which means Benjamin is a devil.\n\n2. **Emma's Statement**: \"Benjamin is a devil.\"\n   - Since Benjamin is a devil, Emma's statement is true. Therefore, Emma must be an angel.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can conclude that:\n\n- Benjamin is a devil.\n- Emma is an angel.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Benjamin is a devil, and Emma is an angel>>>"
