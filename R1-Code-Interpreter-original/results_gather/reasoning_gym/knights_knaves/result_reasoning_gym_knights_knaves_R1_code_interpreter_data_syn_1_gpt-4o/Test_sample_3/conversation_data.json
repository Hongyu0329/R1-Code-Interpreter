  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Daniel, and Lily. \"Daniel is a knight,\" Daniel mentioned. Lily was heard saying, \"if Lily is a knight then Daniel is a knight\". So who is a knight and who is a knave? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Daniel is a knight/knave, and Lily is a knight/knave>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Daniel and Lily, considering the rules of knights and knaves.\n\n1. **Daniel's Statement**: \"Daniel is a knight.\"\n   - If Daniel is a knight, then his statement is true, meaning Daniel is indeed a knight.\n   - If Daniel is a knave, then his statement is false, meaning Daniel is not a knight (which is consistent with him being a knave).\n\n2. **Lily's Statement**: \"If Lily is a knight, then Daniel is a knight.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. Let's analyze it:\n     - If Lily is a knight, then her statement must be true. Therefore, Daniel must be a knight.\n     - If Lily is a knave, then her statement is false. The negation of \"If Lily is a knight, then Daniel is a knight\" is \"Lily is a knight and Daniel is not a knight.\"\n\nLet's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1**: Daniel is a knight.\n  - If Daniel is a knight, his statement is true.\n  - If Lily is a knight, her statement must be true, which is consistent with Daniel being a knight.\n  - If Lily is a knave, her statement is false, which means \"Lily is a knight and Daniel is not a knight\" is true. This contradicts Daniel being a knight. Therefore, Lily cannot be a knave in this scenario.\n\n- **Scenario 2**: Daniel is a knave.\n  - If Daniel is a knave, his statement is false, meaning Daniel is not a knight.\n  - If Lily is a knight, her statement must be true, which means Daniel is a knight. This contradicts Daniel being a knave.\n  - If Lily is a knave, her statement is false, which means \"Lily is a knight and Daniel is not a knight\" is true. This is consistent with Daniel being a knave.\n\nFrom the analysis, the only consistent scenario is:\n- Daniel is a knave.\n- Lily is a knave.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n<<<Daniel is a knave, and Lily is a knave>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves.
