  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by sages and fools. Sages always tell the truth, and fools always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Abigail, and David. As Abigail put it, \"David is a sage if and only if David is a fool\". David said that Abigail is a fool. So who is a sage and who is a fool? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Abigail is a sage/fool, and David is a sage/fool>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Abigail and David.\n\n1. **Abigail's Statement**: \"David is a sage if and only if David is a fool.\"\n   - This statement is a logical contradiction because someone cannot be both a sage and a fool at the same time. Therefore, if Abigail is telling the truth, then the statement must be false, which means Abigail is lying. Hence, Abigail must be a fool.\n\n2. **David's Statement**: \"Abigail is a fool.\"\n   - If David is telling the truth, then Abigail is indeed a fool. If David is lying, then Abigail would be a sage. However, from Abigail's statement, we have already deduced that Abigail is a fool. Therefore, David must be telling the truth, which means David is a sage.\n\nBased on this reasoning, Abigail is a fool, and David is a sage.\n\n<<<Abigail is a fool, and David is a sage>>>"
