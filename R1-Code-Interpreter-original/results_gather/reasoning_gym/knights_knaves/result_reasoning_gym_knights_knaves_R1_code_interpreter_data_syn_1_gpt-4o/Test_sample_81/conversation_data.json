  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by altruists and egoists. Altruists always tell the truth, and egoists always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Riley, and Avery. In Riley's words: \"Avery is an egoist and Avery is an altruist\". \"Riley is an egoist or Avery is an altruist,\" Avery claimed. So who is an altruist and who is an egoist? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Riley is a altruist/egoist, and Avery is a altruist/egoist>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Riley and Avery and determine who is telling the truth and who is lying.\n\n1. **Riley's Statement**: \"Avery is an egoist and Avery is an altruist.\"\n   - This statement is a contradiction because it claims that Avery is both an egoist and an altruist simultaneously, which is impossible. Therefore, Riley's statement must be false.\n\n2. **Avery's Statement**: \"Riley is an egoist or Avery is an altruist.\"\n   - This statement is a logical OR statement. For an OR statement to be true, at least one of the conditions must be true.\n\nLet's analyze the possibilities:\n\n- If Riley is an altruist (truth-teller), then Riley's statement should be true. However, Riley's statement is a contradiction, so Riley cannot be an altruist. Therefore, Riley must be an egoist (liar).\n\n- Since Riley is an egoist, Riley's statement is false, which aligns with our earlier conclusion that Riley's statement is a contradiction.\n\n- Now, let's consider Avery's statement. Since Riley is an egoist, the first part of Avery's statement \"Riley is an egoist\" is true. Therefore, Avery's statement is true, which means Avery is an altruist (truth-teller).\n\nThus, Riley is an egoist, and Avery is an altruist.\n\n<<<Riley is an egoist, and Avery is an altruist>>>"
