  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by saints and sinners. Saints always tell the truth, and sinners always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Alexander, and Sofia. Alexander expressed that Sofia is a saint and Sofia is a sinner. \"Alexander is a saint,\" Sofia claimed. So who is a saint and who is a sinner? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Alexander is a saint/sinner, and Sofia is a saint/sinner>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Alexander and Sofia and determine who is telling the truth and who is lying.\n\n1. **Alexander's Statements:**\n   - Sofia is a saint.\n   - Sofia is a sinner.\n\n   If Alexander is a saint, then both statements must be true. However, it is impossible for Sofia to be both a saint and a sinner simultaneously. Therefore, Alexander cannot be a saint.\n\n2. **Sofia's Statement:**\n   - Alexander is a saint.\n\n   If Sofia is a saint, then her statement must be true, which would mean Alexander is a saint. However, we have already determined that Alexander cannot be a saint because his statements contradict each other. Therefore, Sofia cannot be a saint.\n\nFrom the above reasoning, we conclude:\n- Alexander is a sinner because his statements are contradictory.\n- Sofia is also a sinner because her statement that Alexander is a saint is false.\n\nThus, both Alexander and Sofia are sinners.\n\n<<<Alexander is a sinner, and Sofia is a sinner>>>"
