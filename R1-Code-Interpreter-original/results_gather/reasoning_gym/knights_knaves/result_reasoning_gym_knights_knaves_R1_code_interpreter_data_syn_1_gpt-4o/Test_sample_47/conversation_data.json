  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by saints and sinners. Saints always tell the truth, and sinners always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Ava, and Harper. Ava was heard saying, \"Harper is a sinner or Harper is a saint\". Harper commented, \"Ava is a saint if and only if Ava is a sinner\". So who is a saint and who is a sinner? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Ava is a saint/sinner, and Harper is a saint/sinner>>>)",
  "response_list": [
    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Ava and Harper and determine their truthfulness based on the characteristics of saints and sinners.\n\n1. **Ava's Statement**: \"Harper is a sinner or Harper is a saint.\"\n   - This statement is a tautology because it covers all possibilities. Therefore, regardless of whether Ava is a saint or a sinner, this statement is always true. This doesn't help us determine Ava's nature directly.\n\n2. **Harper's Statement**: \"Ava is a saint if and only if Ava is a sinner.\"\n   - This statement is a contradiction because it states that Ava can be both a saint and a sinner simultaneously, which is impossible. Therefore, Harper's statement is always false.\n\nGiven that Harper's statement is always false, Harper must be a sinner (since sinners always lie).\n\nNow, let's consider Ava:\n- Since Harper is a sinner, Ava's statement doesn't help us directly because it is always true. However, since Harper is a sinner, Ava's statement being a tautology doesn't contradict her being a saint.\n\nTherefore, Ava can be a saint because her statement is always true, and Harper is a sinner because his statement is always false.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n<<<Ava is a saint, and Harper is a sinner>>>"
