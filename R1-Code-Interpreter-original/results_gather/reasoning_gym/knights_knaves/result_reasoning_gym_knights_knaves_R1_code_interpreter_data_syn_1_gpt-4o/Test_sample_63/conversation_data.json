  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by angels and devils. Angels always tell the truth, and devils always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Aurora, and Owen. Aurora stated, \"Owen is a devil if and only if Aurora is an angel\". Owen told you that Aurora is an angel or Owen is an angel. So who is an angel and who is a devil? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Aurora is a angel/devil, and Owen is a angel/devil>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Aurora and Owen and determine their truthfulness based on the nature of angels and devils.\n\n1. **Aurora's Statement**: \"Owen is a devil if and only if Aurora is an angel.\"\n   - This is a biconditional statement, which means it is true if both parts are either true or false.\n   - If Aurora is an angel (truth-teller), then her statement is true, which means Owen is a devil.\n   - If Aurora is a devil (liar), then her statement is false, which means Owen is not a devil, so Owen is an angel.\n\n2. **Owen's Statement**: \"Aurora is an angel or Owen is an angel.\"\n   - This is a disjunction, which is true if at least one of the statements is true.\n   - If Owen is an angel (truth-teller), then his statement is true, which means at least one of them is an angel.\n   - If Owen is a devil (liar), then his statement is false, which means neither of them is an angel.\n\nLet's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1**: Assume Aurora is an angel.\n  - Aurora's statement is true, so Owen is a devil.\n  - Owen's statement must be false (since he is a devil), which means neither Aurora nor Owen is an angel. This contradicts our assumption that Aurora is an angel.\n\n- **Scenario 2**: Assume Aurora is a devil.\n  - Aurora's statement is false, so Owen is an angel.\n  - Owen's statement is true (since he is an angel), which means at least one of them is an angel. This is consistent with our assumption that Owen is an angel.\n\nThe only consistent scenario is that Aurora is a devil and Owen is an angel. Let's confirm this with a simple Python script to verify our logic.\n\n```python\ndef check_statements():\n    # Scenario 1: Aurora is an angel\n    aurora_is_angel = True\n    owen_is_devil = not aurora_is_angel  # Based on Aurora's statement\n    owen_statement = aurora_is_angel or not owen_is_devil  # Owen's statement\n    if aurora_is_angel and not owen_statement:\n        return \"Contradiction in Scenario 1\"\n\n    # Scenario 2: Aurora is a devil\n    aurora_is_angel = False\n    owen_is_angel = not aurora_is_angel  # Based on Aurora's statement\n    owen_statement = aurora_is_angel or owen_is_angel  # Owen's statement\n    if not aurora_is_angel and owen_statement:\n        return \"Scenario 2 is consistent\"\n\n    return \"No consistent scenario found\"\n\nprint(check_statements())\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to verify the logic.",
    "The code execution confirms that Scenario 2 is consistent, which means that Aurora is a devil and Owen is an angel. This aligns with our logical deduction.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Aurora is a devil, and Owen is an angel>>>"
