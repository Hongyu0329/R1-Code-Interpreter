  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by heros and villains. Heros always tell the truth, and villains always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: David, and Olivia. According to David, \"Olivia is a villain\". Olivia was heard saying, \"Olivia is a hero and David is a hero\". So who is a hero and who is a villain? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<David is a hero/villain, and Olivia is a hero/villain>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by David and Olivia and determine who is telling the truth and who is lying.\n\n1. **David's Statement**: \"Olivia is a villain.\"\n   - If David is a hero (truth-teller), then his statement is true, and Olivia is indeed a villain.\n   - If David is a villain (liar), then his statement is false, and Olivia is a hero.\n\n2. **Olivia's Statement**: \"Olivia is a hero and David is a hero.\"\n   - If Olivia is a hero (truth-teller), then both parts of her statement must be true, meaning Olivia is a hero and David is a hero.\n   - If Olivia is a villain (liar), then at least one part of her statement is false. This means either Olivia is not a hero, or David is not a hero, or both.\n\nLet's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1**: Assume David is a hero.\n  - Then David's statement is true, so Olivia is a villain.\n  - If Olivia is a villain, her statement is false. Therefore, \"Olivia is a hero and David is a hero\" is false, which is consistent because Olivia is not a hero.\n\n- **Scenario 2**: Assume David is a villain.\n  - Then David's statement is false, so Olivia is a hero.\n  - If Olivia is a hero, her statement must be true. Therefore, \"Olivia is a hero and David is a hero\" is true, which contradicts our assumption that David is a villain.\n\nFrom the analysis, Scenario 1 is consistent, while Scenario 2 leads to a contradiction. Therefore, the only consistent scenario is that David is a hero and Olivia is a villain.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<David is a hero, and Olivia is a villain>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    A very special island is inhabited only by heros and villains.
