  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by heros and villains. Heros always tell the truth, and villains always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Sofia, and Isabella. Sofia said that Isabella is a hero if and only if Isabella is a villain. Isabella asserted: \"Sofia is a hero\". So who is a hero and who is a villain? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Sofia is a hero/villain, and Isabella is a hero/villain>>>)",
  "response_list": [
    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Sofia and Isabella and determine their truthfulness based on the nature of heros and villains.\n\n1. **Sofia's Statement**: \"Isabella is a hero if and only if Isabella is a villain.\"\n   - This statement is a logical contradiction because a person cannot be both a hero and a villain simultaneously. Therefore, if Sofia is a hero (truth-teller), her statement must be false, which is impossible. Hence, Sofia must be a villain (liar).\n\n2. **Isabella's Statement**: \"Sofia is a hero.\"\n   - Since Sofia is a villain, Isabella's statement is false. Therefore, Isabella must be a hero (truth-teller).\n\nBased on this reasoning, Sofia is a villain, and Isabella is a hero.\n\n<<<Sofia is a villain, and Isabella is a hero>>>"
