  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by altruists and egoists. Altruists always tell the truth, and egoists always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Mason, and Jack. Mason expressed that if Jack is an egoist then Mason is an altruist. In Jack's words: \"Mason is an egoist\". So who is an altruist and who is an egoist? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Mason is a altruist/egoist, and Jack is a altruist/egoist>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Mason and Jack and determine their truthfulness based on the characteristics of altruists and egoists.\n\n1. **Mason's Statement**: \"If Jack is an egoist, then Mason is an altruist.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. For this statement to be true, if the premise (Jack is an egoist) is true, then the conclusion (Mason is an altruist) must also be true. If the premise is false (Jack is not an egoist), the statement is still true regardless of whether Mason is an altruist or not.\n\n2. **Jack's Statement**: \"Mason is an egoist.\"\n   - If Jack is an altruist, this statement is true, meaning Mason is indeed an egoist.\n   - If Jack is an egoist, this statement is false, meaning Mason is not an egoist (i.e., Mason is an altruist).\n\nLet's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1**: Assume Mason is an altruist.\n  - Mason's statement is true. If Jack is an egoist, then Mason is an altruist, which is consistent.\n  - Jack's statement \"Mason is an egoist\" would be false, which means Jack is an egoist.\n\n- **Scenario 2**: Assume Mason is an egoist.\n  - Mason's statement is false. If Jack is an egoist, then Mason is an altruist, which contradicts the assumption that Mason is an egoist.\n  - Jack's statement \"Mason is an egoist\" would be true, which means Jack is an altruist, contradicting the assumption that Mason is an egoist.\n\nFrom the analysis, Scenario 1 is consistent, while Scenario 2 leads to a contradiction. Therefore, Mason is an altruist, and Jack is an egoist.\n\n<<<Mason is an altruist, and Jack is an egoist>>>"
