  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by heros and villains. Heros always tell the truth, and villains always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Olivia, and Sofia. In Olivia's words: \"Sofia is a hero and Sofia is a villain\". Sofia remarked, \"Olivia is a villain or Sofia is a hero\". So who is a hero and who is a villain? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Olivia is a hero/villain, and Sofia is a hero/villain>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Olivia and Sofia, considering the nature of heros and villains.\n\n1. **Olivia's Statement**: \"Sofia is a hero and Sofia is a villain.\"\n   - If Olivia is a hero, she tells the truth. However, her statement is a contradiction because Sofia cannot be both a hero and a villain simultaneously. Therefore, Olivia cannot be a hero.\n   - If Olivia is a villain, she lies. This means her statement is false, which is consistent because Sofia cannot be both a hero and a villain. Therefore, Olivia is a villain.\n\n2. **Sofia's Statement**: \"Olivia is a villain or Sofia is a hero.\"\n   - If Sofia is a hero, she tells the truth. This means either Olivia is a villain or Sofia is a hero (or both), which is consistent with our finding that Olivia is a villain. Therefore, Sofia can be a hero.\n   - If Sofia is a villain, she lies. This means neither Olivia is a villain nor Sofia is a hero, which contradicts our finding that Olivia is a villain. Therefore, Sofia cannot be a villain.\n\nFrom the above reasoning, we conclude:\n- Olivia is a villain.\n- Sofia is a hero.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Olivia is a villain, and Sofia is a hero>>>"
