  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by heros and villains. Heros always tell the truth, and villains always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Aiden, and Matthew. Aiden said that Matthew is a villain if and only if Matthew is a hero. Matthew asserted: \"Matthew is a hero and Aiden is a hero\". So who is a hero and who is a villain? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Aiden is a hero/villain, and Matthew is a hero/villain>>>)",
  "response_list": [
    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Aiden and Matthew and determine their truthfulness based on the nature of heros and villains.\n\n1. **Aiden's Statement**: \"Matthew is a villain if and only if Matthew is a hero.\"\n   - This statement is a logical contradiction because it states that Matthew is a villain if and only if he is a hero, which is impossible. Therefore, Aiden must be lying, which means Aiden is a villain.\n\n2. **Matthew's Statement**: \"Matthew is a hero and Aiden is a hero.\"\n   - Since Aiden is a villain (as deduced from his contradictory statement), Matthew's statement cannot be entirely true. If Matthew were a hero, his statement would be true, but since Aiden is not a hero, Matthew's statement is false. Therefore, Matthew must also be a villain.\n\nThus, both Aiden and Matthew are villains.\n\n<<<Aiden is a villain, and Matthew is a villain>>>"
