  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by saints and sinners. Saints always tell the truth, and sinners always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Aria, and Jacob. \"Jacob is a saint\" - Aria. \"Aria is a sinner and Aria is a saint,\" Jacob declared. So who is a saint and who is a sinner? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Aria is a saint/sinner, and Jacob is a saint/sinner>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Aria and Jacob and determine who is telling the truth and who is lying.\n\n1. Aria says, \"Jacob is a saint.\"\n2. Jacob says, \"Aria is a sinner and Aria is a saint.\"\n\nLet's break down the possibilities:\n\n- If Aria is a saint, then her statement \"Jacob is a saint\" must be true. Therefore, Jacob is also a saint. However, if Jacob is a saint, his statement \"Aria is a sinner and Aria is a saint\" is contradictory because a saint cannot make a false statement. Therefore, Aria cannot be a saint.\n\n- If Aria is a sinner, then her statement \"Jacob is a saint\" is false. Therefore, Jacob is a sinner. If Jacob is a sinner, his statement \"Aria is a sinner and Aria is a saint\" is consistent with him being a liar because it is a contradictory statement.\n\nThus, the only consistent scenario is that Aria is a sinner and Jacob is a sinner.\n\n<<<Aria is a sinner, and Jacob is a sinner>>>"
