  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by sages and fools. Sages always tell the truth, and fools always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Logan, and Jacob. Logan noted, \"if Jacob is a sage then Logan is a sage\". Jacob said that Logan is a sage. So who is a sage and who is a fool? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Logan is a sage/fool, and Jacob is a sage/fool>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Logan and Jacob and determine their truthfulness based on the characteristics of sages and fools.\n\n1. **Logan's Statement**: \"If Jacob is a sage, then Logan is a sage.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. In logic, a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is false only when P is true and Q is false. In all other cases, it is true.\n\n2. **Jacob's Statement**: \"Logan is a sage.\"\n   - This is a straightforward statement. If Jacob is a sage, this statement is true. If Jacob is a fool, this statement is false.\n\nLet's analyze the possibilities:\n\n- **Case 1**: Assume Jacob is a sage.\n  - If Jacob is a sage, his statement \"Logan is a sage\" must be true. Therefore, Logan is a sage.\n  - If Logan is a sage, then his statement \"If Jacob is a sage, then Logan is a sage\" is true because both parts of the conditional are true.\n\n- **Case 2**: Assume Jacob is a fool.\n  - If Jacob is a fool, his statement \"Logan is a sage\" must be false. Therefore, Logan is a fool.\n  - If Logan is a fool, his statement \"If Jacob is a sage, then Logan is a sage\" must be false. For this conditional to be false, Jacob must be a sage (which contradicts our assumption that Jacob is a fool).\n\nFrom the analysis, Case 2 leads to a contradiction, so it cannot be true. Therefore, Case 1 must be true.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple logical check using Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the possible states\nsages = {\"Logan\": False, \"Jacob\": False}\n\n# Check Case 1: Jacob is a sage\nsages[\"Jacob\"] = True\nsages[\"Logan\"] = True  # Because Jacob says Logan is a sage\n\n# Verify Logan's statement: If Jacob is a sage, then Logan is a sage\nlogans_statement = not sages[\"Jacob\"] or sages[\"Logan\"]\n\n# Check if both statements hold true\nresult = logans_statement and sages[\"Jacob\"] == True\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThe code will confirm whether the logical deductions are consistent with the statements made by Logan and Jacob. Let's execute the code to verify.\n\nOnce the code execution is complete, I will provide the final answer.",
    "The code output `True` confirms that the logical deductions are consistent with the statements made by Logan and Jacob. Therefore, the analysis is correct.\n\nBased on the analysis and the code execution, the conclusion is:\n\n<<<Logan is a sage, and Jacob is a sage>>>"
