  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by heros and villains. Heros always tell the truth, and villains always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Isabella, and Jack. \"Isabella is a hero and Jack is a hero,\" Isabella mentioned. As Jack put it, \"Isabella is a hero if and only if Isabella is a villain\". So who is a hero and who is a villain? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Isabella is a hero/villain, and Jack is a hero/villain>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Isabella and Jack.\n\n1. **Isabella's Statement**: \"Isabella is a hero and Jack is a hero.\"\n   - If Isabella is a hero, then her statement is true, which means both Isabella and Jack are heroes.\n   - If Isabella is a villain, then her statement is false, which means at least one of them is a villain.\n\n2. **Jack's Statement**: \"Isabella is a hero if and only if Isabella is a villain.\"\n   - This statement is a contradiction because it states that Isabella can only be a hero if she is a villain, which is impossible.\n   - If Jack is a hero, his statement must be true, but since it's a contradiction, Jack cannot be a hero.\n   - Therefore, Jack must be a villain, and his statement is false.\n\nGiven that Jack is a villain, his statement is false, which means Isabella is not both a hero and a villain. Therefore, Isabella must be a hero.\n\nLet's summarize:\n- Isabella is a hero because if she were a villain, her statement would be false, which would mean at least one of them is a villain. But since Jack is already a villain, Isabella's statement being false would not contradict her being a villain. However, Jack's statement being false confirms Isabella is a hero.\n- Jack is a villain because his statement is a contradiction and must be false.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Isabella is a hero, and Jack is a villain>>>"
