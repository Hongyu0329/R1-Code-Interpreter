  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by sages and fools. Sages always tell the truth, and fools always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Zoey, and Riley. Zoey commented, \"Riley is a fool\". In Riley's words: \"Zoey is a sage or Riley is a sage\". So who is a sage and who is a fool? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Zoey is a sage/fool, and Riley is a sage/fool>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Zoey and Riley and determine their truthfulness based on the characteristics of sages and fools.\n\n1. **Zoey's Statement**: \"Riley is a fool.\"\n   - If Zoey is a sage, then her statement is true, which means Riley is indeed a fool.\n   - If Zoey is a fool, then her statement is false, which means Riley is not a fool (i.e., Riley is a sage).\n\n2. **Riley's Statement**: \"Zoey is a sage or Riley is a sage.\"\n   - If Riley is a sage, then his statement is true. This means at least one of the conditions \"Zoey is a sage\" or \"Riley is a sage\" must be true.\n   - If Riley is a fool, then his statement is false. This means neither \"Zoey is a sage\" nor \"Riley is a sage\" is true, implying both are fools.\n\nLet's analyze these possibilities:\n\n- **Case 1**: Assume Zoey is a sage.\n  - Zoey's statement \"Riley is a fool\" is true.\n  - Therefore, Riley is a fool.\n  - Riley's statement \"Zoey is a sage or Riley is a sage\" must be false because Riley is a fool. This is consistent because Riley being a fool makes his statement false.\n\n- **Case 2**: Assume Zoey is a fool.\n  - Zoey's statement \"Riley is a fool\" is false.\n  - Therefore, Riley is a sage.\n  - Riley's statement \"Zoey is a sage or Riley is a sage\" must be true because Riley is a sage. This is consistent because Riley being a sage makes his statement true.\n\nBoth cases seem consistent, but we need to determine which one is logically possible given the constraints.\n\nLet's use Python to verify these logical conditions:\n\n```python\ndef check_statements():\n    # Case 1: Zoey is a sage\n    zoey_is_sage = True\n    riley_is_fool = True\n    riley_statement_case1 = (zoey_is_sage or not riley_is_fool)  # Riley's statement should be false\n    case1_valid = riley_statement_case1 == False\n\n    # Case 2: Zoey is a fool\n    zoey_is_fool = True\n    riley_is_sage = True\n    riley_statement_case2 = (not zoey_is_fool or riley_is_sage)  # Riley's statement should be true\n    case2_valid = riley_statement_case2 == True\n\n    if case1_valid:\n        return \"Zoey is a sage, and Riley is a fool\"\n    elif case2_valid:\n        return \"Zoey is a fool, and Riley is a sage\"\n    else:\n        return \"No consistent solution\"\n\nprint(check_statements())\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to determine the correct scenario.",
    "Based on the logical analysis and the code execution, the consistent scenario is that Zoey is a fool, and Riley is a sage. This conclusion is derived from the fact that if Zoey is a fool, her statement about Riley being a fool is false, meaning Riley is a sage. Riley's statement, being a sage, is true, which is consistent with the condition that either Zoey is a sage or Riley is a sage. Since Riley is indeed a sage, his statement holds true.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Zoey is a fool, and Riley is a sage>>>"
