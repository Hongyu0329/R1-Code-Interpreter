  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by altruists and egoists. Altruists always tell the truth, and egoists always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Sophia, and Abigail. \"Abigail is an egoist and Abigail is an altruist,\" Sophia claimed. Abigail expressed that Sophia is an egoist. So who is an altruist and who is an egoist? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Sophia is a altruist/egoist, and Abigail is a altruist/egoist>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Sophia and Abigail and determine who is telling the truth and who is lying.\n\n1. **Sophia's Statement**: \"Abigail is an egoist and Abigail is an altruist.\"\n   - This statement is a contradiction because Abigail cannot be both an egoist and an altruist at the same time. Therefore, Sophia's statement must be false.\n\n2. **Abigail's Statement**: \"Sophia is an egoist.\"\n   - If Abigail is telling the truth, then Sophia is indeed an egoist. If Abigail is lying, then Sophia is an altruist.\n\nLet's analyze the possibilities:\n\n- If Sophia is an altruist (truth-teller), her statement must be true. However, her statement is a contradiction, so Sophia cannot be an altruist. Therefore, Sophia must be an egoist (liar).\n\n- Since Sophia is an egoist, her statement is false, which aligns with our earlier conclusion that her statement is a contradiction.\n\n- Now, considering Abigail's statement: If Abigail is an altruist (truth-teller), then her statement that \"Sophia is an egoist\" is true, which is consistent with our conclusion that Sophia is an egoist.\n\n- If Abigail were an egoist (liar), her statement would be false, meaning Sophia would be an altruist, which contradicts our earlier conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the only consistent scenario is that Sophia is an egoist and Abigail is an altruist.\n\n<<<Sophia is an egoist, and Abigail is an altruist>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    A very special island is inhabited only by altruists and egoists.
