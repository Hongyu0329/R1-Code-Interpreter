  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by sages and fools. Sages always tell the truth, and fools always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Olivia, and Abigail. Olivia was heard saying, \"Abigail is a sage\". Abigail commented, \"Olivia is a sage or Olivia is a fool\". So who is a sage and who is a fool? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Olivia is a sage/fool, and Abigail is a sage/fool>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Olivia and Abigail and determine who is a sage and who is a fool.\n\n1. **Olivia's Statement**: \"Abigail is a sage.\"\n   - If Olivia is a sage, then her statement is true, which means Abigail is a sage.\n   - If Olivia is a fool, then her statement is false, which means Abigail is a fool.\n\n2. **Abigail's Statement**: \"Olivia is a sage or Olivia is a fool.\"\n   - This statement is a tautology (always true) because it covers all possibilities. Therefore, it doesn't provide direct information about Abigail's nature. However, we can analyze it in the context of the island's rules:\n     - If Abigail is a sage, her statement must be true, which it is, because it is a tautology.\n     - If Abigail is a fool, her statement must be false, but since it's a tautology, it cannot be false. Therefore, Abigail cannot be a fool.\n\nFrom Abigail's statement, we deduce that Abigail must be a sage because her statement is always true, and a fool cannot make a true statement.\n\nNow, let's revisit Olivia's statement:\n- Since Abigail is a sage, Olivia's statement \"Abigail is a sage\" is true.\n- Therefore, Olivia must also be a sage because only a sage can make a true statement.\n\nThus, both Olivia and Abigail are sages.\n\n<<<Olivia is a sage, and Abigail is a sage>>>"
