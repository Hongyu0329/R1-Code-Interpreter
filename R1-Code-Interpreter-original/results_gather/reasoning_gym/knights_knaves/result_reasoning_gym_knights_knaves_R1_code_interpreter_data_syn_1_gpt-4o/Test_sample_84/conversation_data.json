  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by sages and fools. Sages always tell the truth, and fools always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Victoria, and Grace. In a statement by Victoria: \"if Victoria is a sage then Grace is a fool\". Grace remarked, \"Victoria is a sage and Grace is a sage\". So who is a sage and who is a fool? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Victoria is a sage/fool, and Grace is a sage/fool>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Victoria and Grace and determine their truthfulness based on the nature of sages and fools.\n\n1. **Victoria's Statement**: \"If Victoria is a sage, then Grace is a fool.\"\n   - If Victoria is a sage, her statement must be true. Therefore, Grace must be a fool.\n   - If Victoria is a fool, her statement is false. This means that if Victoria were a sage, Grace would not be a fool, implying Grace is a sage.\n\n2. **Grace's Statement**: \"Victoria is a sage and Grace is a sage.\"\n   - If Grace is a sage, her statement must be true. Therefore, both Victoria and Grace are sages.\n   - If Grace is a fool, her statement is false. Therefore, at least one of them is not a sage.\n\nLet's analyze these possibilities:\n\n- **Case 1**: Assume Victoria is a sage.\n  - Victoria's statement: If Victoria is a sage, then Grace is a fool. This must be true, so Grace is a fool.\n  - Grace's statement: \"Victoria is a sage and Grace is a sage.\" This is false because Grace is a fool, which is consistent with Grace being a fool.\n\n- **Case 2**: Assume Victoria is a fool.\n  - Victoria's statement: If Victoria is a sage, then Grace is a fool. This is false, so if Victoria were a sage, Grace would be a sage.\n  - Grace's statement: \"Victoria is a sage and Grace is a sage.\" This is false, which is consistent with Grace being a fool.\n\nFrom the analysis, Case 1 is consistent and satisfies all conditions. Therefore, Victoria is a sage, and Grace is a fool.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple logical check using Python code:\n\n```python\ndef check_statements():\n    # Assume Victoria is a sage\n    victoria_is_sage = True\n    grace_is_fool = True  # Based on Victoria's statement if she is a sage\n\n    # Check Grace's statement\n    grace_statement = victoria_is_sage and not grace_is_fool  # Grace says both are sages\n\n    # If Grace's statement is false, Grace is a fool\n    if not grace_statement:\n        print(\"Victoria is a sage, and Grace is a fool\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Victoria is a fool, and Grace is a sage\")\n\ncheck_statements()\n```\n\nThe code will confirm the logical deduction. Let's execute it.",
    "The code execution confirms our logical deduction. Based on the analysis and the code output, the conclusion is:\n\n<<<Victoria is a sage, and Grace is a fool>>>"
