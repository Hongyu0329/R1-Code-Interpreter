  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by heros and villains. Heros always tell the truth, and villains always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: David, and Mia. David asserted: \"Mia is a hero\". In Mia's words: \"David is a hero or David is a villain\". So who is a hero and who is a villain? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<David is a hero/villain, and Mia is a hero/villain>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by David and Mia, considering the nature of heros and villains on the island.\n\n1. **David's Statement**: \"Mia is a hero.\"\n   - If David is a hero, then his statement is true, which means Mia is a hero.\n   - If David is a villain, then his statement is false, which means Mia is a villain.\n\n2. **Mia's Statement**: \"David is a hero or David is a villain.\"\n   - This statement is a tautology because it covers all possibilities (everyone is either a hero or a villain). Therefore, it is always true regardless of whether Mia is a hero or a villain.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1**: David is a hero.\n  - If David is a hero, his statement \"Mia is a hero\" must be true. Therefore, Mia is a hero.\n  - Mia's statement is true (as it is a tautology), which is consistent with her being a hero.\n\n- **Scenario 2**: David is a villain.\n  - If David is a villain, his statement \"Mia is a hero\" must be false. Therefore, Mia is a villain.\n  - Mia's statement is true (as it is a tautology), which is consistent with her being a villain.\n\nBoth scenarios are logically consistent, but we need to determine which one is correct. Since Mia's statement is always true, the key lies in David's statement. If David is a hero, his statement must be true, making Mia a hero. If David is a villain, his statement must be false, making Mia a villain.\n\nTherefore, the only consistent scenario is that David is a hero and Mia is a hero. This is because Mia's statement does not provide any contradiction in either case, but David's statement does when he is a villain.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n<<<David is a hero, and Mia is a hero>>>"
