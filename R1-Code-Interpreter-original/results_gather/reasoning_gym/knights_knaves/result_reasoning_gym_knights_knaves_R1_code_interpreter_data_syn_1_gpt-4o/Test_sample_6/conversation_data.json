  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by angels and devils. Angels always tell the truth, and devils always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: James, and Liam. \"Liam is an angel or Liam is a devil\" - James. Liam remarked, \"James is an angel or James is a devil\". So who is an angel and who is a devil? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<James is a angel/devil, and Liam is a angel/devil>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by James and Liam, considering the nature of angels and devils.\n\n1. **James's Statement**: \"Liam is an angel or Liam is a devil.\"\n   - This statement is a tautology because it covers all possibilities. Therefore, regardless of whether James is an angel or a devil, this statement is always true. \n   - If James is an angel, he tells the truth, and the statement is true.\n   - If James is a devil, he lies, but since the statement is always true, it doesn't help us determine James's nature.\n\n2. **Liam's Statement**: \"James is an angel or James is a devil.\"\n   - Similar to James's statement, this is also a tautology. It is always true because it covers all possibilities.\n   - If Liam is an angel, he tells the truth, and the statement is true.\n   - If Liam is a devil, he lies, but since the statement is always true, it doesn't help us determine Liam's nature.\n\nSince both statements are tautologies, they do not provide any information to distinguish between angels and devils. Therefore, based on the given statements alone, we cannot definitively determine who is an angel and who is a devil.\n\nThus, the answer is that the statements do not provide enough information to determine the nature of James and Liam.\n\n<<<The statements do not provide enough information to determine who is an angel and who is a devil.>>>"
