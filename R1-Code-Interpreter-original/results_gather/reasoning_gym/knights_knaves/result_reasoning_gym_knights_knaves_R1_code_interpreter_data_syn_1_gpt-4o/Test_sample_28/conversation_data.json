  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by pioneers and laggards. Pioneers always tell the truth, and laggards always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Benjamin, and Sofia. Benjamin asserted: \"Benjamin is a pioneer or Sofia is a laggard\". Sofia commented, \"Benjamin is a pioneer if and only if Benjamin is a laggard\". So who is a pioneer and who is a laggard? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Benjamin is a pioneer/laggard, and Sofia is a pioneer/laggard>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Benjamin and Sofia, considering the nature of pioneers and laggards.\n\n1. **Benjamin's Statement**: \"Benjamin is a pioneer or Sofia is a laggard.\"\n   - If Benjamin is a pioneer (truth-teller), then his statement is true. This means either Benjamin is a pioneer or Sofia is a laggard (or both).\n   - If Benjamin is a laggard (liar), then his statement is false. This means neither Benjamin is a pioneer nor Sofia is a laggard.\n\n2. **Sofia's Statement**: \"Benjamin is a pioneer if and only if Benjamin is a laggard.\"\n   - This is a logical contradiction because a person cannot be both a pioneer and a laggard simultaneously. \n   - If Sofia is a pioneer, her statement must be true, which is impossible because it is a contradiction.\n   - Therefore, Sofia must be a laggard, meaning her statement is false.\n\nLet's analyze the possibilities:\n\n- **Case 1**: Benjamin is a pioneer.\n  - Benjamin's statement is true: \"Benjamin is a pioneer or Sofia is a laggard.\" This is consistent because Sofia is indeed a laggard.\n  - Sofia's statement is false, which is consistent with her being a laggard.\n\n- **Case 2**: Benjamin is a laggard.\n  - Benjamin's statement is false: \"Benjamin is a pioneer or Sofia is a laggard.\" This means neither Benjamin is a pioneer nor Sofia is a laggard, which contradicts our conclusion that Sofia is a laggard.\n\nFrom the analysis, Case 1 is consistent, and Case 2 leads to a contradiction. Therefore, Benjamin must be a pioneer, and Sofia must be a laggard.\n\n<<<Benjamin is a pioneer, and Sofia is a laggard>>>"
