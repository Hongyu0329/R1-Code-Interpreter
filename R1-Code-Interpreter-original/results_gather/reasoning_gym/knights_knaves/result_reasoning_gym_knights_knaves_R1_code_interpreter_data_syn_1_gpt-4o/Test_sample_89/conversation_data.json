  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Ella, and Alexander. Ella asserted: \"Ella is a knight or Alexander is a knight\". In Alexander's words: \"Ella is a knave\". So who is a knight and who is a knave? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Ella is a knight/knave, and Alexander is a knight/knave>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Ella and Alexander and determine their truthfulness based on the rules of knights and knaves.\n\n1. **Ella's Statement**: \"Ella is a knight or Alexander is a knight.\"\n   - If Ella is a knight, then her statement is true. This means either Ella is a knight (which is consistent) or Alexander is a knight.\n   - If Ella is a knave, then her statement is false. This means neither Ella is a knight nor Alexander is a knight.\n\n2. **Alexander's Statement**: \"Ella is a knave.\"\n   - If Alexander is a knight, then his statement is true, which means Ella is indeed a knave.\n   - If Alexander is a knave, then his statement is false, which means Ella is not a knave (i.e., Ella is a knight).\n\nLet's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1**: Assume Ella is a knight.\n  - Ella's statement is true, so either Ella is a knight (which is consistent) or Alexander is a knight.\n  - Alexander's statement \"Ella is a knave\" would be false, which means Alexander is a knave.\n\n- **Scenario 2**: Assume Ella is a knave.\n  - Ella's statement is false, so neither Ella is a knight nor Alexander is a knight.\n  - Alexander's statement \"Ella is a knave\" would be true, which means Alexander is a knight.\n\nFrom the above scenarios, Scenario 1 is consistent because it satisfies both statements:\n- Ella is a knight, making her statement true.\n- Alexander is a knave, making his statement false.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n<<<Ella is a knight, and Alexander is a knave>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves.
