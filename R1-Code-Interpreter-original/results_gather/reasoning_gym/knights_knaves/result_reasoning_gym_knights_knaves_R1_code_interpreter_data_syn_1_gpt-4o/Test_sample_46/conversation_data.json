  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by saints and sinners. Saints always tell the truth, and sinners always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Matthew, and David. Matthew commented, \"Matthew is a saint if and only if David is a saint\". As David put it, \"if Matthew is a saint then Matthew is a sinner\". So who is a saint and who is a sinner? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Matthew is a saint/sinner, and David is a saint/sinner>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Matthew and David and determine their truthfulness based on the nature of saints and sinners.\n\n1. **Matthew's Statement**: \"Matthew is a saint if and only if David is a saint.\"\n   - This is a biconditional statement, which means both parts must be true or both must be false for the statement to be true.\n   - If Matthew is a saint, then his statement is true, which implies David must also be a saint.\n   - If Matthew is a sinner, then his statement is false, which implies David is not a saint (i.e., David is a sinner).\n\n2. **David's Statement**: \"If Matthew is a saint then Matthew is a sinner.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement.\n   - If David is a saint, then his statement is true, which implies that if Matthew is a saint, then Matthew is a sinner, which is a contradiction. Therefore, Matthew cannot be a saint.\n   - If David is a sinner, then his statement is false, which implies that Matthew is a saint.\n\nLet's analyze these statements logically:\n\n- Assume Matthew is a saint:\n  - Matthew's statement is true, so David must be a saint.\n  - But if David is a saint, his statement implies Matthew is a sinner, which contradicts our assumption.\n\n- Assume Matthew is a sinner:\n  - Matthew's statement is false, so David is a sinner.\n  - If David is a sinner, his statement is false, which implies Matthew is a saint, contradicting our assumption.\n\nSince both assumptions lead to contradictions, let's use a code to verify the logical possibilities:\n\n```python\ndef check_statements():\n    # Possible states: (Matthew, David)\n    # True represents saint, False represents sinner\n    possibilities = [(True, True), (True, False), (False, True), (False, False)]\n    \n    for matthew, david in possibilities:\n        # Matthew's statement: \"Matthew is a saint if and only if David is a saint\"\n        matthew_statement = (matthew == david)\n        \n        # David's statement: \"If Matthew is a saint then Matthew is a sinner\"\n        david_statement = (not matthew or not matthew)\n        \n        # Check if the statements align with their nature\n        if matthew == matthew_statement and david == david_statement:\n            return matthew, david\n\nresult = check_statements()\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the correct configuration.",
    "The code output indicates that Matthew is a sinner and David is a saint. This aligns with the logical deductions:\n\n- If Matthew is a sinner, his statement \"Matthew is a saint if and only if David is a saint\" is false, which means David is not a saint. However, since the code output shows David as a saint, this suggests a contradiction in the initial assumption.\n- If David is a saint, his statement \"If Matthew is a saint then Matthew is a sinner\" is true, which implies Matthew cannot be a saint, confirming Matthew is indeed a sinner.\n\nThus, the logical conclusion based on the code output is:\n\n<<<Matthew is a sinner, and David is a saint>>>"
