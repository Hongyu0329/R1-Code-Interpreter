  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Owen, and Charlotte. According to Owen, \"Charlotte is a knave\". Charlotte asserted: \"if Charlotte is a knight then Owen is a knave\". So who is a knight and who is a knave? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Owen is a knight/knave, and Charlotte is a knight/knave>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Owen and Charlotte and determine their truthfulness based on the rules of knights and knaves.\n\n1. **Owen's Statement**: \"Charlotte is a knave.\"\n   - If Owen is a knight, then his statement is true, which means Charlotte is a knave.\n   - If Owen is a knave, then his statement is false, which means Charlotte is a knight.\n\n2. **Charlotte's Statement**: \"If Charlotte is a knight then Owen is a knave.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. The only way for this statement to be false (if Charlotte is a knave) is if Charlotte is a knight and Owen is not a knave (i.e., Owen is a knight).\n\nLet's analyze the possibilities:\n\n- **Case 1**: Assume Owen is a knight.\n  - Then Owen's statement is true, so Charlotte is a knave.\n  - If Charlotte is a knave, her statement is false. The statement \"If Charlotte is a knight then Owen is a knave\" is false if Charlotte is a knight and Owen is a knight, which contradicts our assumption that Owen is a knight. Therefore, this case is not possible.\n\n- **Case 2**: Assume Owen is a knave.\n  - Then Owen's statement is false, so Charlotte is a knight.\n  - If Charlotte is a knight, her statement must be true. The statement \"If Charlotte is a knight then Owen is a knave\" is true if Charlotte is a knight and Owen is a knave, which is consistent with our assumption.\n\nThus, the only consistent scenario is that Owen is a knave and Charlotte is a knight.\n\n<<<Owen is a knave, and Charlotte is a knight>>>"
