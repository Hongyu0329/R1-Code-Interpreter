  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by altruists and egoists. Altruists always tell the truth, and egoists always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Elizabeth, and Olivia. In Elizabeth's words: \"Olivia is an egoist if and only if Olivia is an altruist\". \"Elizabeth is an altruist,\" Olivia mentioned. So who is an altruist and who is an egoist? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Elizabeth is a altruist/egoist, and Olivia is a altruist/egoist>>>)",
  "response_list": [
    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Elizabeth and Olivia and determine their truthfulness based on the characteristics of altruists and egoists.\n\n1. **Elizabeth's Statement**: \"Olivia is an egoist if and only if Olivia is an altruist.\"\n   - This statement is a logical contradiction because it states that Olivia is both an egoist and an altruist simultaneously, which is impossible. Therefore, Elizabeth must be lying, which means Elizabeth is an egoist.\n\n2. **Olivia's Statement**: \"Elizabeth is an altruist.\"\n   - Since we have determined that Elizabeth is an egoist, Olivia's statement is false. Therefore, Olivia is telling the truth, which means Olivia is an altruist.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can conclude:\n- Elizabeth is an egoist.\n- Olivia is an altruist.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Elizabeth is an egoist, and Olivia is an altruist>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    A very special island is inhabited only by altruists and egoists.
