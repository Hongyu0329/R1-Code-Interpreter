  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by heros and villains. Heros always tell the truth, and villains always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Henry, and Ethan. According to Henry, \"Henry is a hero if and only if Ethan is a hero\". \"Henry is a villain,\" Ethan claimed. So who is a hero and who is a villain? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Henry is a hero/villain, and Ethan is a hero/villain>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Henry and Ethan and determine their truthfulness based on the nature of heros and villains.\n\n1. **Henry's Statement**: \"Henry is a hero if and only if Ethan is a hero.\"\n   - This is a biconditional statement, meaning both parts must be true or both must be false for the statement to be true.\n   - If Henry is a hero (truth-teller), then Ethan must also be a hero for the statement to be true.\n   - If Henry is a villain (liar), then the statement is false, meaning one is a hero and the other is a villain.\n\n2. **Ethan's Statement**: \"Henry is a villain.\"\n   - If Ethan is a hero (truth-teller), then Henry must be a villain.\n   - If Ethan is a villain (liar), then Henry must be a hero.\n\nLet's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1**: Assume Henry is a hero.\n  - Then, according to Henry's statement, Ethan must also be a hero.\n  - But if Ethan is a hero, his statement \"Henry is a villain\" would be false, which contradicts our assumption that Henry is a hero.\n\n- **Scenario 2**: Assume Henry is a villain.\n  - Then, Henry's statement is false, meaning one is a hero and the other is a villain.\n  - If Ethan is a hero, his statement \"Henry is a villain\" is true, which is consistent with our assumption.\n  - Therefore, Henry is a villain and Ethan is a hero.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only consistent scenario is that Henry is a villain and Ethan is a hero.\n\n<<<Henry is a villain, and Ethan is a hero>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
