  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by altruists and egoists. Altruists always tell the truth, and egoists always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Ava, and Victoria. \"Victoria is an altruist if and only if Ava is an altruist,\" Ava declared. Victoria noted, \"Ava is an egoist\". So who is an altruist and who is an egoist? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Ava is a altruist/egoist, and Victoria is a altruist/egoist>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Ava and Victoria and determine who is telling the truth and who is lying.\n\n1. **Ava's Statement**: \"Victoria is an altruist if and only if Ava is an altruist.\"\n   - This is a biconditional statement, which means both parts must be true or both must be false.\n   - If Ava is an altruist (truth-teller), then her statement is true, meaning Victoria is also an altruist.\n   - If Ava is an egoist (liar), then her statement is false, meaning Victoria is not an altruist (i.e., Victoria is an egoist).\n\n2. **Victoria's Statement**: \"Ava is an egoist.\"\n   - If Victoria is an altruist, then her statement is true, meaning Ava is an egoist.\n   - If Victoria is an egoist, then her statement is false, meaning Ava is an altruist.\n\nLet's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1**: Ava is an altruist.\n  - Ava's statement is true, so Victoria is also an altruist.\n  - However, if Victoria is an altruist, her statement \"Ava is an egoist\" would be false, which contradicts Ava being an altruist.\n\n- **Scenario 2**: Ava is an egoist.\n  - Ava's statement is false, so Victoria is an egoist.\n  - If Victoria is an egoist, her statement \"Ava is an egoist\" is false, which means Ava is actually an altruist.\n\nBoth scenarios lead to contradictions, so let's re-evaluate:\n\n- If Ava is an egoist, her statement is false, meaning Victoria is not an altruist (i.e., Victoria is an egoist).\n- If Victoria is an egoist, her statement \"Ava is an egoist\" is false, meaning Ava is an altruist.\n\nThis consistent scenario is:\n- Ava is an altruist.\n- Victoria is an egoist.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n<<<Ava is an altruist, and Victoria is an egoist>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
