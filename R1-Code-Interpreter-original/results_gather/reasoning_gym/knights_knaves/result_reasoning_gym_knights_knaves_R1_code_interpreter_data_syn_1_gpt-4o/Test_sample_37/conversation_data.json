  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by sages and fools. Sages always tell the truth, and fools always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: David, and Jacob. David said that Jacob is a fool if and only if Jacob is a sage. Jacob stated, \"David is a fool\". So who is a sage and who is a fool? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<David is a sage/fool, and Jacob is a sage/fool>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by David and Jacob and determine their truthfulness based on the characteristics of sages and fools.\n\n1. **David's Statement**: \"Jacob is a fool if and only if Jacob is a sage.\"\n   - This statement is a logical contradiction because it states that Jacob is a fool if and only if he is a sage, which is impossible since one cannot be both a fool and a sage simultaneously. Therefore, David's statement is inherently false.\n\n2. **Jacob's Statement**: \"David is a fool.\"\n   - If Jacob is a sage, he tells the truth, meaning David is indeed a fool.\n   - If Jacob is a fool, he lies, meaning David is not a fool (i.e., David is a sage).\n\nLet's analyze the possibilities:\n\n- **Case 1**: Assume David is a sage.\n  - If David is a sage, his statement must be true. However, his statement is a contradiction and cannot be true. Therefore, David cannot be a sage.\n\n- **Case 2**: Assume David is a fool.\n  - If David is a fool, his statement is false, which aligns with the fact that his statement is a contradiction. Therefore, David being a fool is consistent.\n\nNow, considering Jacob's statement:\n- If Jacob is a sage, his statement \"David is a fool\" is true, which is consistent with our finding that David is a fool.\n- If Jacob is a fool, his statement \"David is a fool\" is false, which contradicts our finding that David is a fool.\n\nThus, the only consistent scenario is:\n- David is a fool.\n- Jacob is a sage.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the problem is:\n<<<David is a fool, and Jacob is a sage>>>"
