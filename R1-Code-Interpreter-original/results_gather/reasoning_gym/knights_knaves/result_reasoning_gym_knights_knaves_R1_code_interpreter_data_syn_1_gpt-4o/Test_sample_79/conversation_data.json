  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Riley, and Grace. Riley was heard saying, \"Grace is a knight or Grace is a knave\". Grace stated, \"Riley is a knave if and only if Riley is a knight\". So who is a knight and who is a knave? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Riley is a knight/knave, and Grace is a knight/knave>>>)",
  "response_list": [
    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Riley and Grace and determine their truthfulness based on the rules of knights and knaves.\n\n1. **Riley's Statement**: \"Grace is a knight or Grace is a knave.\"\n   - This statement is always true because every inhabitant is either a knight or a knave. Therefore, Riley's statement does not provide any information about Riley's own identity.\n\n2. **Grace's Statement**: \"Riley is a knave if and only if Riley is a knight.\"\n   - This statement is a logical contradiction because it implies that Riley is both a knave and a knight at the same time, which is impossible. Therefore, Grace must be lying.\n\nSince Grace is lying, Grace is a knave. Now, let's determine Riley's identity:\n\n- If Grace is a knave, then Riley's statement \"Grace is a knight or Grace is a knave\" is true, which is consistent with Riley being a knight.\n\nTherefore, Riley is a knight, and Grace is a knave.\n\n<<<Riley is a knight, and Grace is a knave>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves.
