  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by angels and devils. Angels always tell the truth, and devils always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Mia, and Lily. \"Lily is a devil,\" Mia mentioned. Lily told you that Mia is a devil or Mia is an angel. So who is an angel and who is a devil? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Mia is a angel/devil, and Lily is a angel/devil>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Mia and Lily and determine who is an angel and who is a devil.\n\n1. **Mia's Statement**: \"Lily is a devil.\"\n   - If Mia is an angel (truth-teller), then her statement is true, and Lily is indeed a devil.\n   - If Mia is a devil (liar), then her statement is false, and Lily is not a devil (i.e., Lily is an angel).\n\n2. **Lily's Statement**: \"Mia is a devil or Mia is an angel.\"\n   - This statement is a tautology (always true) because it covers all possibilities (Mia being either a devil or an angel). Therefore, it doesn't provide any useful information about Lily's nature.\n\nLet's analyze the scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1**: Assume Mia is an angel.\n  - Mia's statement \"Lily is a devil\" is true.\n  - Therefore, Lily is a devil.\n\n- **Scenario 2**: Assume Mia is a devil.\n  - Mia's statement \"Lily is a devil\" is false.\n  - Therefore, Lily is an angel.\n\nSince Lily's statement doesn't help us distinguish between the two scenarios, we rely on Mia's statement. The only consistent scenario is Scenario 1, where Mia is an angel and Lily is a devil.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n<<<Mia is an angel, and Lily is a devil>>>"
