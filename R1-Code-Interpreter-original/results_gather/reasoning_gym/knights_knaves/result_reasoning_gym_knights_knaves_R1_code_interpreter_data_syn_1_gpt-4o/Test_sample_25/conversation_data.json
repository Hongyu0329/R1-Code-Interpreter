  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by sages and fools. Sages always tell the truth, and fools always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Lucas, and Jacob. In a statement by Lucas: \"Lucas is a sage if and only if Jacob is a sage\". Jacob remarked, \"if Jacob is a sage then Lucas is a fool\". So who is a sage and who is a fool?

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Lucas and Jacob and determine their truthfulness based on the nature of sages and fools.\n\n1. **Lucas's Statement**: \"Lucas is a sage if and only if Jacob is a sage.\"\n   - This is a biconditional statement, which means both parts must be true or both must be false for the statement to be true.\n   - If Lucas is a sage, then Jacob must also be a sage for the statement to be true.\n   - If Lucas is a fool, then Jacob must also be a fool for the statement to be true.\n\n2. **Jacob's Statement**: \"If Jacob is a sage then Lucas is a fool.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement.\n   - If Jacob is a sage, then Lucas must be a fool for the statement to be true.\n   - If Jacob is a fool, the statement is automatically true regardless of Lucas's status.\n\nLet's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1**: Lucas is a sage.\n  - According to Lucas's statement, Jacob must also be a sage.\n  - But if Jacob is a sage, then according to Jacob's statement, Lucas must be a fool, which contradicts our assumption that Lucas is a sage.\n  - Therefore, Lucas cannot be a sage.\n\n- **Scenario 2**: Lucas is a fool.\n  - According to Lucas's statement, Jacob must also be a fool.\n  - If Jacob is a fool, then Jacob's statement is automatically true regardless of Lucas's status.\n  - This scenario does not lead to any contradictions.\n\nThus, the only consistent scenario is that both Lucas and Jacob are fools.\n\nLet's confirm this conclusion with a simple logical check using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Define the possible states\nsages = {\"Lucas\": False, \"Jacob\": False}  # Assume both are fools initially\n\n# Check Lucas's statement: \"Lucas is a sage if and only if Jacob is a sage\"\nlucas_statement = (sages[\"Lucas\"] == sages[\"Jacob\"])\n\n# Check Jacob's statement: \"If Jacob is a sage then Lucas is a fool\"\njacob_statement = (not sages[\"Jacob\"] or not sages[\"Lucas\"])\n\n# Both statements should be true for the scenario to be consistent\nconsistent_scenario = lucas_statement and jacob_statement\n\nprint(consistent_scenario)\n```\n\nThe code will confirm whether the scenario where both Lucas and Jacob are fools is consistent with their statements.",
    "The code output being `True` confirms that the scenario where both Lucas and Jacob are fools is consistent with their statements. This means that the logical deductions we made are correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<Lucas is a fool, and Jacob is a fool>>>"
