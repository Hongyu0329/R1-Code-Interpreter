  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by altruists and egoists. Altruists always tell the truth, and egoists always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Benjamin, and Mason. Benjamin was heard saying, \"Benjamin is an altruist or Mason is an egoist\". As Mason put it, \"Benjamin is an egoist if and only if Benjamin is an altruist\". So who is an altruist and who is an egoist? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Benjamin is a altruist/egoist, and Mason is a altruist/egoist>>>)",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Benjamin and Mason and determine who is an altruist and who is an egoist.\n\n1. **Benjamin's Statement**: \"Benjamin is an altruist or Mason is an egoist.\"\n   - If Benjamin is an altruist, he tells the truth. Therefore, his statement is true.\n   - If Benjamin is an egoist, he lies. Therefore, his statement is false.\n\n2. **Mason's Statement**: \"Benjamin is an egoist if and only if Benjamin is an altruist.\"\n   - This statement is a logical contradiction because it states that Benjamin is an egoist if and only if he is an altruist, which is impossible. \n   - If Mason is an altruist, he tells the truth, but his statement is a contradiction, so he cannot be an altruist.\n   - Therefore, Mason must be an egoist, and his statement is false.\n\nGiven that Mason is an egoist, his statement is false. This means that \"Benjamin is an egoist if and only if Benjamin is an altruist\" is false, which implies that Benjamin is not both an egoist and an altruist simultaneously. \n\nNow, let's analyze Benjamin's statement:\n- If Mason is an egoist (which we have determined to be true), then Benjamin's statement \"Benjamin is an altruist or Mason is an egoist\" is true.\n- Therefore, Benjamin can be an altruist because his statement is true.\n\nThus, Benjamin is an altruist, and Mason is an egoist.\n\n<<<Benjamin is an altruist, and Mason is an egoist>>>"
