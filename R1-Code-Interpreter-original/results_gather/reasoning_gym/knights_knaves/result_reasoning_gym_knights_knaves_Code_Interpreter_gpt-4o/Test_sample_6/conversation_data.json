  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by angels and devils. Angels always tell the truth, and devils always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: James, and Liam. \"Liam is an angel or Liam is a devil\" - James. Liam remarked, \"James is an angel or James is a devil\". So who is an angel and who is a devil? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<James is a angel/devil, and Liam is a angel/devil>>>)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by James and Liam.\n\n1. **James's Statement**: \"Liam is an angel or Liam is a devil.\"\n   - This statement is always true because it covers all possibilities. Therefore, James's statement does not provide any information about whether he is an angel or a devil.\n\n2. **Liam's Statement**: \"James is an angel or James is a devil.\"\n   - Similar to James's statement, this statement is also always true because it covers all possibilities. Therefore, Liam's statement does not provide any information about whether he is an angel or a devil.\n\nSince both statements are tautologies (always true), they do not help us distinguish between angels and devils. However, we know that:\n\n- Angels always tell the truth.\n- Devils always lie.\n\nGiven that both statements are true, both James and Liam could be angels, as angels always tell the truth. However, since devils always lie, neither James nor Liam can be a devil because their statements are true.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility is that both James and Liam are angels.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<James is an angel, and Liam is an angel>>>"
