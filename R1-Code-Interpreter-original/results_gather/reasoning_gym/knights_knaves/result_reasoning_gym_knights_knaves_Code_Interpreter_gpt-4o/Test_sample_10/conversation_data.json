  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by sages and fools. Sages always tell the truth, and fools always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Zoey, and Riley. Zoey commented, \"Riley is a fool\". In Riley's words: \"Zoey is a sage or Riley is a sage\". So who is a sage and who is a fool? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Zoey is a sage/fool, and Riley is a sage/fool>>>)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Zoey and Riley.\n\n1. **Zoey's Statement**: \"Riley is a fool.\"\n   - If Zoey is a sage (truth-teller), then Riley must indeed be a fool.\n   - If Zoey is a fool (liar), then Riley must be a sage.\n\n2. **Riley's Statement**: \"Zoey is a sage or Riley is a sage.\"\n   - If Riley is a sage (truth-teller), then at least one part of the statement must be true: either Zoey is a sage, or Riley is a sage.\n   - If Riley is a fool (liar), then both parts of the statement must be false: Zoey is not a sage, and Riley is not a sage.\n\nLet's analyze the possibilities:\n\n- **Case 1**: Assume Zoey is a sage.\n  - Zoey's statement \"Riley is a fool\" is true, so Riley is a fool.\n  - Riley's statement \"Zoey is a sage or Riley is a sage\" must be false (since Riley is a fool), which means both parts are false: Zoey is not a sage (contradiction) and Riley is not a sage (true).\n\n- **Case 2**: Assume Zoey is a fool.\n  - Zoey's statement \"Riley is a fool\" is false, so Riley is a sage.\n  - Riley's statement \"Zoey is a sage or Riley is a sage\" is true (since Riley is a sage), which means at least one part is true: Zoey is a sage (false) or Riley is a sage (true).\n\nThe only consistent scenario is Case 2, where Zoey is a fool and Riley is a sage.\n\nThus, the solution is: <<<Zoey is a fool, and Riley is a sage>>>."
