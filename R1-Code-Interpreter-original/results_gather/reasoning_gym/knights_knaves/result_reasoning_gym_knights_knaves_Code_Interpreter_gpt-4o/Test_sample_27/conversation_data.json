  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by heros and villains. Heros always tell the truth, and villains always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: David, and Mia. David asserted: \"Mia is a hero\". In Mia's words: \"David is a hero or David is a villain\". So who is a hero and who is a villain? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<David is a hero/villain, and Mia is a hero/villain>>>)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by David and Mia.\n\n1. **David's Statement**: \"Mia is a hero.\"\n   - If David is a hero, he tells the truth, so Mia must be a hero.\n   - If David is a villain, he lies, so Mia must be a villain.\n\n2. **Mia's Statement**: \"David is a hero or David is a villain.\"\n   - This statement is always true because it covers all possibilities (either David is a hero or a villain). Therefore, Mia's statement doesn't provide any new information about her own identity.\n\nLet's analyze the possibilities:\n\n- **Case 1**: Assume David is a hero.\n  - If David is a hero, his statement \"Mia is a hero\" must be true. Therefore, Mia is a hero.\n  - Mia's statement \"David is a hero or David is a villain\" is trivially true, so it doesn't contradict her being a hero.\n\n- **Case 2**: Assume David is a villain.\n  - If David is a villain, his statement \"Mia is a hero\" must be false. Therefore, Mia is a villain.\n  - Mia's statement \"David is a hero or David is a villain\" is still true, which is consistent with her being a villain (since villains lie, but this statement is always true).\n\nBoth cases are consistent with the statements made. However, the only consistent scenario where both statements hold true without contradiction is:\n\n- David is a hero, and Mia is a hero.\n\nTherefore, the solution is: \n\n<<<David is a hero, and Mia is a hero>>>"
