  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Riley, and Grace. Riley was heard saying, \"Grace is a knight or Grace is a knave\". Grace stated, \"Riley is a knave if and only if Riley is a knight\". So who is a knight and who is a knave? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Riley is a knight/knave, and Grace is a knight/knave>>>)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the statements made by Riley and Grace.\n\n1. **Riley's Statement**: \"Grace is a knight or Grace is a knave.\"\n   - This statement is always true because every inhabitant is either a knight or a knave. Therefore, Riley's statement does not provide any information about Riley's own identity. Riley could be either a knight or a knave.\n\n2. **Grace's Statement**: \"Riley is a knave if and only if Riley is a knight.\"\n   - This statement is a contradiction because it states that Riley is a knave if and only if Riley is a knight, which is impossible. Therefore, Grace must be lying.\n\nSince Grace is lying, Grace is a knave. \n\nNow, let's determine Riley's identity:\n- If Grace is a knave, then Riley's statement \"Grace is a knight or Grace is a knave\" is true, which means Riley is telling the truth.\n\nTherefore, Riley is a knight.\n\nThe solution is:\n<<<Riley is a knight, and Grace is a knave>>>"
