  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Jackson, and Mason. In Jackson's words: \"Jackson is a knight or Mason is a knave\". \"Jackson is a knave if and only if Jackson is a knight,\" Mason declared. So who is a knight and who is a knave? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Jackson is a knight/knave, and Mason is a knight/knave>>>)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Jackson and Mason.\n\n1. **Jackson's Statement**: \"Jackson is a knight or Mason is a knave.\"\n\n   - If Jackson is a knight, then his statement is true. This means either Jackson is a knight (which is true) or Mason is a knave.\n   - If Jackson is a knave, then his statement is false. This means neither Jackson is a knight (which is true, since he is a knave) nor Mason is a knave (which means Mason is a knight).\n\n2. **Mason's Statement**: \"Jackson is a knave if and only if Jackson is a knight.\"\n\n   - This statement is a contradiction because it states that Jackson is a knave if and only if Jackson is a knight, which is impossible. Therefore, Mason must be lying, which means Mason is a knave.\n\nGiven that Mason is a knave, Jackson's statement \"Jackson is a knight or Mason is a knave\" must be true because Mason is indeed a knave. Therefore, Jackson is a knight.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n<<<Jackson is a knight, and Mason is a knave>>>"
