  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by altruists and egoists. Altruists always tell the truth, and egoists always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Sophia, and Oliver. Sophia said that Sophia is an altruist if and only if Oliver is an egoist. Oliver noted, \"Sophia is an egoist if and only if Oliver is an altruist\". So who is an altruist and who is an egoist? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Sophia is a altruist/egoist, and Oliver is a altruist/egoist>>>)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Sophia and Oliver.\n\n1. **Sophia's Statement**: \"Sophia is an altruist if and only if Oliver is an egoist.\"\n\n   This can be broken down into two parts:\n   - If Sophia is an altruist, then Oliver is an egoist.\n   - If Oliver is an egoist, then Sophia is an altruist.\n\n2. **Oliver's Statement**: \"Sophia is an egoist if and only if Oliver is an altruist.\"\n\n   This can be broken down into two parts:\n   - If Sophia is an egoist, then Oliver is an altruist.\n   - If Oliver is an altruist, then Sophia is an egoist.\n\nLet's analyze the possibilities:\n\n- **Case 1**: Assume Sophia is an altruist.\n  - According to Sophia's statement, Oliver must be an egoist.\n  - According to Oliver's statement, if Oliver is an egoist, then Sophia should be an egoist, which contradicts our assumption.\n\n- **Case 2**: Assume Sophia is an egoist.\n  - According to Sophia's statement, Oliver must be an altruist.\n  - According to Oliver's statement, if Oliver is an altruist, then Sophia should be an egoist, which is consistent with our assumption.\n\nTherefore, the only consistent scenario is that Sophia is an egoist and Oliver is an altruist.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<Sophia is an egoist, and Oliver is an altruist>>>"
