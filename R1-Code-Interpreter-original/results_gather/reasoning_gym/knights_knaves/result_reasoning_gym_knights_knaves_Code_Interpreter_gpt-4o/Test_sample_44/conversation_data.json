  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Ava, and Scarlett. Ava told you that Ava is a knight if and only if Scarlett is a knave. Scarlett stated, \"if Ava is a knight then Scarlett is a knight\". So who is a knight and who is a knave? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Ava is a knight/knave, and Scarlett is a knight/knave>>>)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Ava and Scarlett.\n\n1. Ava says: \"Ava is a knight if and only if Scarlett is a knave.\"\n   - This is a biconditional statement, which means both parts must have the same truth value. \n   - If Ava is a knight, then the statement is true, and Scarlett must be a knave.\n   - If Ava is a knave, then the statement is false, and Scarlett must be a knight.\n\n2. Scarlett says: \"If Ava is a knight, then Scarlett is a knight.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement.\n   - If Scarlett is a knight, then the statement is true, and Ava must be a knight.\n   - If Scarlett is a knave, then the statement is false, and Ava must be a knight (since the premise \"Ava is a knight\" would be true, making the whole statement false).\n\nLet's analyze the possibilities:\n\n- **Case 1**: Ava is a knight.\n  - Ava's statement is true, so Scarlett must be a knave.\n  - Scarlett's statement would be false (since Ava is a knight but Scarlett is not), which is consistent because Scarlett is a knave.\n\n- **Case 2**: Ava is a knave.\n  - Ava's statement is false, so Scarlett must be a knight.\n  - Scarlett's statement would be true (since Ava is not a knight, the premise is false, making the whole statement true), which is consistent because Scarlett is a knight.\n\nBoth cases seem consistent, but we need to determine which one is correct. Let's consider the implications:\n\n- If Ava is a knight, Scarlett must be a knave, and Scarlett's statement would be false, which is consistent.\n- If Ava is a knave, Scarlett must be a knight, and Scarlett's statement would be true, which is consistent.\n\nThe only consistent scenario is when Ava is a knight and Scarlett is a knave. Therefore, the solution is:\n\n<<<Ava is a knight, and Scarlett is a knave>>>"
