  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by saints and sinners. Saints always tell the truth, and sinners always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Matthew, and David. Matthew commented, \"Matthew is a saint if and only if David is a saint\". As David put it, \"if Matthew is a saint then Matthew is a sinner\". So who is a saint and who is a sinner? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Matthew is a saint/sinner, and David is a saint/sinner>>>)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Matthew and David.\n\n1. **Matthew's Statement**: \"Matthew is a saint if and only if David is a saint.\"\n   - This is a biconditional statement, which means both parts must be either true or false together.\n   - If Matthew is a saint (truth-teller), then his statement is true, which implies David is also a saint.\n   - If Matthew is a sinner (liar), then his statement is false, which implies David is not a saint (i.e., David is a sinner).\n\n2. **David's Statement**: \"If Matthew is a saint then Matthew is a sinner.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement.\n   - If David is a saint (truth-teller), then the statement must be true. This implies that if Matthew is a saint, then Matthew is a sinner, which is a contradiction. Therefore, Matthew cannot be a saint, so Matthew must be a sinner.\n   - If David is a sinner (liar), then the statement is false. This means that if Matthew is a saint, then Matthew is not a sinner, which is consistent.\n\nLet's analyze the possibilities:\n\n- **Case 1**: Assume Matthew is a saint.\n  - Matthew's statement would be true, so David must be a saint.\n  - David's statement would then imply a contradiction (a saint cannot be a sinner), so this case is not possible.\n\n- **Case 2**: Assume Matthew is a sinner.\n  - Matthew's statement would be false, so David must be a sinner.\n  - David's statement would be false, which is consistent because if Matthew is a saint, then Matthew is not a sinner.\n\nThus, the only consistent scenario is that both Matthew and David are sinners.\n\nTherefore, the solution is: \n\n<<<Matthew is a sinner, and David is a sinner>>>"
