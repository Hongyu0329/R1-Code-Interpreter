  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by altruists and egoists. Altruists always tell the truth, and egoists always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Riley, and Avery. In Riley's words: \"Avery is an egoist and Avery is an altruist\". \"Riley is an egoist or Avery is an altruist,\" Avery claimed. So who is an altruist and who is an egoist? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Riley is a altruist/egoist, and Avery is a altruist/egoist>>>)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Riley and Avery.\n\n1. Riley says: \"Avery is an egoist and Avery is an altruist.\"\n   - This statement is a contradiction because one person cannot be both an egoist and an altruist. Therefore, Riley's statement is false.\n\n2. Avery says: \"Riley is an egoist or Avery is an altruist.\"\n   - This statement can be true in two scenarios:\n     a) Riley is an egoist.\n     b) Avery is an altruist.\n\nSince Riley's statement is false, Riley must be an egoist (because egoists always lie). \n\nNow, let's consider Avery's statement:\n- If Riley is an egoist (which we have determined to be true), then Avery's statement \"Riley is an egoist or Avery is an altruist\" is true regardless of whether Avery is an altruist or an egoist.\n\nSince Avery's statement is true, Avery must be an altruist (because altruists always tell the truth).\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n<<<Riley is an egoist, and Avery is an altruist>>>"
