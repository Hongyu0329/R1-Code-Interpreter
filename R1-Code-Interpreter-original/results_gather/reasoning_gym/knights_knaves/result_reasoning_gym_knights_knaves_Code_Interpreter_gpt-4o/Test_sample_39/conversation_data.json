  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by saints and sinners. Saints always tell the truth, and sinners always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Isabella, and Joseph. \"Joseph is a sinner,\" Isabella declared. In Joseph's words: \"Isabella is a saint if and only if Joseph is a saint\". So who is a saint and who is a sinner? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Isabella is a saint/sinner, and Joseph is a saint/sinner>>>)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Isabella and Joseph.\n\n1. **Isabella's Statement**: \"Joseph is a sinner.\"\n   - If Isabella is a saint (truth-teller), then her statement is true, and Joseph is indeed a sinner.\n   - If Isabella is a sinner (liar), then her statement is false, and Joseph is a saint.\n\n2. **Joseph's Statement**: \"Isabella is a saint if and only if Joseph is a saint.\"\n   - This is a biconditional statement, which means both parts must be either true or false together.\n   - If Joseph is a saint (truth-teller), then the statement must be true, meaning Isabella is a saint if and only if Joseph is a saint.\n   - If Joseph is a sinner (liar), then the statement is false, meaning Isabella is a saint if and only if Joseph is not a saint.\n\nLet's analyze the possibilities:\n\n- **Case 1**: Assume Isabella is a saint.\n  - Then Joseph must be a sinner (since Isabella's statement is true).\n  - If Joseph is a sinner, his statement is false. The falsehood of his statement means that Isabella is a saint if and only if Joseph is not a saint, which is consistent with our assumption.\n\n- **Case 2**: Assume Isabella is a sinner.\n  - Then Joseph must be a saint (since Isabella's statement is false).\n  - If Joseph is a saint, his statement is true. The truth of his statement means that Isabella is a saint if and only if Joseph is a saint, which contradicts our assumption.\n\nTherefore, the only consistent scenario is Case 1.\n\nThus, the solution is: <<<Isabella is a saint, and Joseph is a sinner>>>."
