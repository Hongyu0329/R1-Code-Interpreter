  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Sebastian, and Zoey. \"Zoey is a knight or Zoey is a knave,\" Sebastian claimed. Zoey remarked, \"Sebastian is a knight\". So who is a knight and who is a knave? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Sebastian is a knight/knave, and Zoey is a knight/knave>>>)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze the statements made by Sebastian and Zoey.\n\n1. Sebastian claims: \"Zoey is a knight or Zoey is a knave.\"\n   - This statement is always true because every inhabitant is either a knight or a knave. Therefore, Sebastian's statement does not provide any information about his own identity.\n\n2. Zoey claims: \"Sebastian is a knight.\"\n   - If Zoey is a knight, then her statement is true, which means Sebastian is indeed a knight.\n   - If Zoey is a knave, then her statement is false, which means Sebastian is not a knight (i.e., Sebastian is a knave).\n\nLet's consider the possibilities:\n\n- If Zoey is a knight, then her statement is true, and Sebastian is a knight.\n- If Zoey is a knave, then her statement is false, and Sebastian is a knave.\n\nSince both possibilities are consistent with the rules of the island, we can conclude that:\n\n- Zoey is a knave, and Sebastian is a knave.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n<<<Sebastian is a knave, and Zoey is a knave>>>"
