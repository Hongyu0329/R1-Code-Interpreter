    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, let's analyze the statements made by Ella and Elizabeth.\n\n1. **Ella's Statement**: \"Elizabeth is a sinner if and only if Elizabeth is a saint.\"\n   - This statement is a logical contradiction because it states that Elizabeth is a sinner if and only if she is a saint, which is impossible. Therefore, Ella must be lying, which means Ella is a sinner.\n\n2. **Elizabeth's Statement**: \"Elizabeth is a saint and Ella is a saint.\"\n   - Since we have determined that Ella is a sinner, Elizabeth's statement cannot be entirely true. Therefore, Elizabeth must also be lying, which means Elizabeth is a sinner.\n\nThus, both Ella and Elizabeth are sinners.\n\nThe answer is: <<<Ella is a sinner, and Elizabeth is a sinner>>>."
