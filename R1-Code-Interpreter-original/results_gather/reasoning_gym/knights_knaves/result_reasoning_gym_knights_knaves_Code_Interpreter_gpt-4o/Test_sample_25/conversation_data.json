  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by sages and fools. Sages always tell the truth, and fools always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Lucas, and Jacob. In a statement by Lucas: \"Lucas is a sage if and only if Jacob is a sage\". Jacob remarked, \"if Jacob is a sage then Lucas is a fool\". So who is a sage and who is a fool? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Lucas is a sage/fool, and Jacob is a sage/fool>>>)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Lucas and Jacob.\n\n1. **Lucas's Statement**: \"Lucas is a sage if and only if Jacob is a sage.\"\n   - This is a biconditional statement, which means both parts must be true or both must be false. In logical terms, this can be expressed as: \\( L \\leftrightarrow J \\), where \\( L \\) is true if Lucas is a sage and false if Lucas is a fool, and \\( J \\) is true if Jacob is a sage and false if Jacob is a fool.\n\n2. **Jacob's Statement**: \"If Jacob is a sage then Lucas is a fool.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement, which can be expressed as: \\( J \\rightarrow \\neg L \\).\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- If Lucas is a sage (\\( L = \\text{True} \\)), then his statement must be true. Therefore, Jacob must also be a sage (\\( J = \\text{True} \\)).\n- If Jacob is a sage (\\( J = \\text{True} \\)), then according to his statement, Lucas must be a fool (\\( L = \\text{False} \\)).\n\nNow, let's check the consistency of these statements:\n\n1. Assume Lucas is a sage (\\( L = \\text{True} \\)):\n   - Lucas's statement: \\( L \\leftrightarrow J \\) implies \\( J = \\text{True} \\).\n   - Jacob's statement: \\( J \\rightarrow \\neg L \\) implies \\( \\neg L = \\text{True} \\), which means \\( L = \\text{False} \\).\n   - This is a contradiction, so Lucas cannot be a sage.\n\n2. Assume Lucas is a fool (\\( L = \\text{False} \\)):\n   - Lucas's statement: \\( L \\leftrightarrow J \\) implies \\( J = \\text{False} \\).\n   - Jacob's statement: \\( J \\rightarrow \\neg L \\) is vacuously true because \\( J = \\text{False} \\).\n\nThis scenario is consistent, so the solution is:\n\n<<<Lucas is a fool, and Jacob is a fool>>>"
