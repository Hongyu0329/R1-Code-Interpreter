  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by angels and devils. Angels always tell the truth, and devils always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Victoria, and Grace. According to Victoria, \"Victoria is an angel or Grace is an angel\". Grace noted, \"Grace is an angel if and only if Victoria is a devil\". So who is an angel and who is a devil? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Victoria is a angel/devil, and Grace is a angel/devil>>>)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Victoria and Grace.\n\n1. **Victoria's Statement**: \"Victoria is an angel or Grace is an angel.\"\n   - If Victoria is an angel, then her statement is true. This means either Victoria is an angel or Grace is an angel (or both).\n   - If Victoria is a devil, then her statement is false. This means neither Victoria is an angel nor Grace is an angel.\n\n2. **Grace's Statement**: \"Grace is an angel if and only if Victoria is a devil.\"\n   - This is a biconditional statement, which means both sides must be either true or false together.\n   - If Grace is an angel, then Victoria must be a devil.\n   - If Grace is a devil, then Victoria must be an angel.\n\nLet's analyze the possibilities:\n\n- **Case 1**: Assume Victoria is an angel.\n  - Victoria's statement is true, so either Victoria is an angel or Grace is an angel (or both).\n  - Grace's statement must be false (since she is a devil), which means Grace is not an angel, and Victoria is not a devil. This is consistent because Victoria is an angel.\n\n- **Case 2**: Assume Victoria is a devil.\n  - Victoria's statement is false, so neither Victoria is an angel nor Grace is an angel.\n  - Grace's statement must be true (since she is an angel), which means Grace is an angel if and only if Victoria is a devil. This is a contradiction because Grace cannot be an angel if Victoria is a devil.\n\nFrom the analysis, Case 1 is consistent, and Case 2 leads to a contradiction. Therefore, the solution is:\n\n<<<Victoria is an angel, and Grace is a devil>>>"
