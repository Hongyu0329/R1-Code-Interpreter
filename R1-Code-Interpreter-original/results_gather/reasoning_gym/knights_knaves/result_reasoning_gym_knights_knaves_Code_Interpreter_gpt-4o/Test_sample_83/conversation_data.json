  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by altruists and egoists. Altruists always tell the truth, and egoists always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Zoey, and Ella. Zoey said that if Ella is an altruist then Zoey is an altruist. Ella stated, \"Zoey is an altruist if and only if Zoey is an egoist\". So who is an altruist and who is an egoist? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Zoey is a altruist/egoist, and Ella is a altruist/egoist>>>)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Zoey and Ella.\n\n1. **Zoey's Statement**: \"If Ella is an altruist, then Zoey is an altruist.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement: \\( E \\rightarrow Z \\) (If Ella is an altruist, then Zoey is an altruist).\n\n2. **Ella's Statement**: \"Zoey is an altruist if and only if Zoey is an egoist.\"\n   - This is a biconditional statement: \\( Z \\leftrightarrow \\neg Z \\) (Zoey is an altruist if and only if Zoey is an egoist).\n\nLet's analyze the possibilities:\n\n- If Zoey is an altruist, then her statement must be true. This means that if Ella is an altruist, then Zoey is an altruist, which is consistent.\n- If Ella is an altruist, then her statement must be true. However, her statement \\( Z \\leftrightarrow \\neg Z \\) is a contradiction because it implies that Zoey is both an altruist and an egoist, which is impossible.\n\nTherefore, Ella cannot be an altruist because her statement would be a contradiction. Ella must be an egoist, which means her statement is false.\n\nSince Ella is an egoist, Zoey's statement \\( E \\rightarrow Z \\) becomes vacuously true because the premise (Ella is an altruist) is false. Therefore, Zoey can be either an altruist or an egoist.\n\nHowever, since Ella is an egoist, her statement \\( Z \\leftrightarrow \\neg Z \\) is false, which means Zoey is not both an altruist and an egoist. This implies that Zoey is an altruist.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n- Zoey is an altruist.\n- Ella is an egoist.\n\nThe answer is: <<<Zoey is an altruist, and Ella is an egoist>>>."
