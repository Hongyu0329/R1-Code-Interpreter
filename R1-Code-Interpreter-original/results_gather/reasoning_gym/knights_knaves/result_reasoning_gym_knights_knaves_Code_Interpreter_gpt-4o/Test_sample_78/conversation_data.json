  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by sages and fools. Sages always tell the truth, and fools always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Sebastian, and Benjamin. \"Benjamin is a fool,\" Sebastian declared. Benjamin remarked, \"Sebastian is a sage if and only if Benjamin is a sage\". So who is a sage and who is a fool? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Sebastian is a sage/fool, and Benjamin is a sage/fool>>>)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Sebastian and Benjamin.\n\n1. **Sebastian's Statement**: \"Benjamin is a fool.\"\n   - If Sebastian is a sage (truth-teller), then his statement is true, and Benjamin is indeed a fool.\n   - If Sebastian is a fool (liar), then his statement is false, and Benjamin is a sage.\n\n2. **Benjamin's Statement**: \"Sebastian is a sage if and only if Benjamin is a sage.\"\n   - This is a biconditional statement, which means both parts must be true or both must be false.\n   - If Benjamin is a sage (truth-teller), then the statement must be true, meaning Sebastian is a sage.\n   - If Benjamin is a fool (liar), then the statement must be false, meaning one of the parts is true and the other is false.\n\nLet's analyze the possibilities:\n\n- **Case 1**: Sebastian is a sage.\n  - Then, his statement \"Benjamin is a fool\" is true, so Benjamin is a fool.\n  - If Benjamin is a fool, his statement must be false. The statement \"Sebastian is a sage if and only if Benjamin is a sage\" is false, which is consistent because Sebastian is a sage and Benjamin is a fool.\n\n- **Case 2**: Sebastian is a fool.\n  - Then, his statement \"Benjamin is a fool\" is false, so Benjamin is a sage.\n  - If Benjamin is a sage, his statement must be true. The statement \"Sebastian is a sage if and only if Benjamin is a sage\" is true, which is inconsistent because Sebastian is a fool and Benjamin is a sage.\n\nFrom this analysis, only Case 1 is consistent. Therefore, the solution is:\n\n<<<Sebastian is a sage, and Benjamin is a fool>>>"
