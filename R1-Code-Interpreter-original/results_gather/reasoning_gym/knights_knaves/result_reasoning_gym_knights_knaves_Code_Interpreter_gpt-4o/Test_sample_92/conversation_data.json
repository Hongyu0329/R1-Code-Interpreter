  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by heros and villains. Heros always tell the truth, and villains always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Sofia, and Isabella. Sofia said that Isabella is a hero if and only if Isabella is a villain. Isabella asserted: \"Sofia is a hero\". So who is a hero and who is a villain? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Sofia is a hero/villain, and Isabella is a hero/villain>>>)",
  "response_list": [
    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Sofia and Isabella.\n\n1. **Sofia's Statement**: \"Isabella is a hero if and only if Isabella is a villain.\"\n\n   This statement is a contradiction because it states that Isabella is both a hero and a villain at the same time, which is impossible. Therefore, Sofia must be lying, which means Sofia is a villain.\n\n2. **Isabella's Statement**: \"Sofia is a hero.\"\n\n   Since Sofia is a villain (as determined from her contradictory statement), Isabella's statement is false. Therefore, Isabella is also a villain.\n\nThus, both Sofia and Isabella are villains.\n\nThe answer is: <<<Sofia is a villain, and Isabella is a villain>>>."
