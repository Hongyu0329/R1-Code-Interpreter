    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Benjamin and Emma.\n\n1. **Benjamin's Statement**: \"Emma is a devil if and only if Emma is an angel.\"\n   - This statement is a contradiction because it states that Emma is a devil if and only if she is an angel, which is impossible. Therefore, Benjamin must be lying, which means Benjamin is a devil.\n\n2. **Emma's Statement**: \"Benjamin is a devil.\"\n   - Since Benjamin is indeed a devil, Emma is telling the truth, which means Emma is an angel.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n<<<Benjamin is a devil, and Emma is an angel>>>"
