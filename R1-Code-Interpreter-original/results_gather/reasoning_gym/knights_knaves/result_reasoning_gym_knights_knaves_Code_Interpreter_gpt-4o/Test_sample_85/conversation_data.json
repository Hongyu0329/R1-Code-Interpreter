  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by altruists and egoists. Altruists always tell the truth, and egoists always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Ava, and Victoria. \"Victoria is an altruist if and only if Ava is an altruist,\" Ava declared. Victoria noted, \"Ava is an egoist\". So who is an altruist and who is an egoist? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Ava is a altruist/egoist, and Victoria is a altruist/egoist>>>)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Ava and Victoria.\n\n1. Ava says, \"Victoria is an altruist if and only if Ava is an altruist.\" This statement can be broken down into two parts:\n   - If Victoria is an altruist, then Ava is an altruist.\n   - If Ava is an altruist, then Victoria is an altruist.\n\n2. Victoria says, \"Ava is an egoist.\"\n\nLet's consider the possibilities:\n\n- **Case 1: Ava is an altruist.**\n  - If Ava is an altruist, then her statement must be true. Therefore, Victoria is an altruist.\n  - However, if Victoria is an altruist, her statement \"Ava is an egoist\" would be false, which contradicts the assumption that Victoria is an altruist.\n\n- **Case 2: Ava is an egoist.**\n  - If Ava is an egoist, then her statement must be false. Therefore, it is not true that \"Victoria is an altruist if and only if Ava is an altruist.\"\n  - This means either:\n    - Victoria is an altruist and Ava is an egoist, or\n    - Victoria is an egoist and Ava is an altruist.\n  - However, if Victoria is an egoist, her statement \"Ava is an egoist\" would be true, which is consistent with Ava being an egoist.\n\nTherefore, the only consistent scenario is that Ava is an egoist and Victoria is an altruist.\n\nThus, the answer is: <<<Ava is an egoist, and Victoria is an altruist>>>."
