  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by sages and fools. Sages always tell the truth, and fools always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Jacob, and Emma. Jacob noted, \"Emma is a sage if and only if Emma is a fool\". \"Jacob is a sage if and only if Jacob is a fool,\" Emma claimed. So who is a sage and who is a fool? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Jacob is a sage/fool, and Emma is a sage/fool>>>)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Jacob and Emma.\n\n1. Jacob says, \"Emma is a sage if and only if Emma is a fool.\"\n   - This statement is a contradiction because someone cannot be both a sage and a fool at the same time. Therefore, Jacob's statement is false.\n\n2. Emma says, \"Jacob is a sage if and only if Jacob is a fool.\"\n   - This statement is also a contradiction for the same reason. Therefore, Emma's statement is false.\n\nSince both statements are false, both Jacob and Emma must be fools because only fools lie.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n<<<Jacob is a fool, and Emma is a fool>>>"
