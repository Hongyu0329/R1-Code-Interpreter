  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by sages and fools. Sages always tell the truth, and fools always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Henry, and Chloe. Henry was heard saying, \"Chloe is a sage\". As Chloe put it, \"if Henry is a sage then Chloe is a sage\". So who is a sage and who is a fool? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Henry is a sage/fool, and Chloe is a sage/fool>>>)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Henry and Chloe.\n\n1. **Henry's Statement**: \"Chloe is a sage.\"\n   - If Henry is a sage, then his statement is true, and Chloe is indeed a sage.\n   - If Henry is a fool, then his statement is false, and Chloe is not a sage (i.e., Chloe is a fool).\n\n2. **Chloe's Statement**: \"If Henry is a sage then Chloe is a sage.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. The only way this statement is false is if Henry is a sage and Chloe is not a sage.\n   - If Chloe is a sage, then her statement is true regardless of whether Henry is a sage or a fool.\n   - If Chloe is a fool, then her statement is false, which means Henry is a sage and Chloe is not a sage.\n\nLet's analyze the possibilities:\n\n- **Case 1**: Henry is a sage.\n  - If Henry is a sage, then his statement \"Chloe is a sage\" must be true, so Chloe is a sage.\n  - If Chloe is a sage, her statement \"If Henry is a sage then Chloe is a sage\" is true, which is consistent.\n\n- **Case 2**: Henry is a fool.\n  - If Henry is a fool, then his statement \"Chloe is a sage\" is false, so Chloe is a fool.\n  - If Chloe is a fool, her statement \"If Henry is a sage then Chloe is a sage\" is false, which means Henry is a sage, leading to a contradiction.\n\nThe only consistent scenario is Case 1, where Henry is a sage and Chloe is a sage.\n\nThus, the solution is: <<<Henry is a sage, and Chloe is a sage>>>."
