  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by saints and sinners. Saints always tell the truth, and sinners always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Ava, and Harper. Ava was heard saying, \"Harper is a sinner or Harper is a saint\". Harper commented, \"Ava is a saint if and only if Ava is a sinner\". So who is a saint and who is a sinner? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Ava is a saint/sinner, and Harper is a saint/sinner>>>)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, let's analyze the statements made by Ava and Harper.\n\n1. **Ava's Statement**: \"Harper is a sinner or Harper is a saint.\"\n   - This statement is always true because it covers all possibilities (everyone is either a sinner or a saint). Therefore, Ava's statement does not provide any information about her own nature.\n\n2. **Harper's Statement**: \"Ava is a saint if and only if Ava is a sinner.\"\n   - This statement is a contradiction because it states that Ava can be both a saint and a sinner simultaneously, which is impossible.\n\nNow, let's determine the nature of each person:\n\n- If Harper were a saint, his statement would have to be true. However, his statement is a contradiction, which means it cannot be true. Therefore, Harper cannot be a saint; he must be a sinner.\n\n- Since Harper is a sinner, his statement is false. The falsehood of his statement implies that Ava is not both a saint and a sinner, which is consistent with the fact that Ava can only be one or the other.\n\nSince Harper is a sinner, Ava's statement (\"Harper is a sinner or Harper is a saint\") is true, which means Ava is a saint.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n<<<Ava is a saint, and Harper is a sinner>>>"
