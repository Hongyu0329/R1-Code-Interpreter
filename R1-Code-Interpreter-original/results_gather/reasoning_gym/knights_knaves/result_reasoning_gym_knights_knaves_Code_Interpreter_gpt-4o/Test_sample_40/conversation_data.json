  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by angels and devils. Angels always tell the truth, and devils always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Ava, and Benjamin. In Ava's words: \"if Benjamin is a devil then Benjamin is an angel\". Benjamin asserted: \"Ava is an angel and Ava is a devil\". So who is an angel and who is a devil? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Ava is a angel/devil, and Benjamin is a angel/devil>>>)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Ava and Benjamin.\n\n1. **Ava's Statement:** \"If Benjamin is a devil, then Benjamin is an angel.\"\n\n   - If Ava is an angel (truth-teller), then her statement must be true. However, the statement \"If Benjamin is a devil, then Benjamin is an angel\" is a contradiction because a devil cannot be an angel. Therefore, Ava cannot be an angel.\n   - If Ava is a devil (liar), then her statement must be false. The statement \"If Benjamin is a devil, then Benjamin is an angel\" being false means that Benjamin is indeed a devil. This is consistent with Ava being a devil.\n\n2. **Benjamin's Statement:** \"Ava is an angel and Ava is a devil.\"\n\n   - This statement is a contradiction because Ava cannot be both an angel and a devil at the same time.\n   - If Benjamin is an angel (truth-teller), his statement must be true, which is impossible because it is a contradiction. Therefore, Benjamin cannot be an angel.\n   - If Benjamin is a devil (liar), his statement must be false. The statement \"Ava is an angel and Ava is a devil\" being false means that Ava is not both an angel and a devil, which is consistent with Ava being a devil.\n\nFrom the analysis above, we conclude that:\n\n- Ava is a devil.\n- Benjamin is a devil.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<Ava is a devil, and Benjamin is a devil>>>"
