  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by sages and fools. Sages always tell the truth, and fools always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Abigail, and David. As Abigail put it, \"David is a sage if and only if David is a fool\". David said that Abigail is a fool. So who is a sage and who is a fool? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Abigail is a sage/fool, and David is a sage/fool>>>)",

    "\nassistant > Let's analyze the statements:\n\n1. Abigail says, \"David is a sage if and only if David is a fool.\" This statement is a contradiction because someone cannot be both a sage and a fool at the same time. Therefore, Abigail must be lying, which means Abigail is a fool.\n\n2. David says, \"Abigail is a fool.\" Since Abigail is indeed a fool, David is telling the truth, which means David is a sage.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n<<<Abigail is a fool, and David is a sage>>>"
