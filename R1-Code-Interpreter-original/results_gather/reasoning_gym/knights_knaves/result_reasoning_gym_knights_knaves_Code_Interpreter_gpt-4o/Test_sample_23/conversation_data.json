  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by saints and sinners. Saints always tell the truth, and sinners always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Aria, and Sofia. As Aria put it, \"Sofia is a saint\". \"Aria is a sinner or Aria is a saint,\" Sofia declared. So who is a saint and who is a sinner? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Aria is a saint/sinner, and Sofia is a saint/sinner>>>)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Aria and Sofia.\n\n1. Aria says, \"Sofia is a saint.\"\n2. Sofia says, \"Aria is a sinner or Aria is a saint.\"\n\nLet's consider the possibilities:\n\n- **Case 1: Aria is a saint.**\n  - If Aria is a saint, then her statement \"Sofia is a saint\" must be true. Therefore, Sofia is a saint.\n  - If Sofia is a saint, her statement \"Aria is a sinner or Aria is a saint\" is also true because it is a tautology (a statement that is always true).\n\n- **Case 2: Aria is a sinner.**\n  - If Aria is a sinner, then her statement \"Sofia is a saint\" must be false. Therefore, Sofia is a sinner.\n  - If Sofia is a sinner, her statement \"Aria is a sinner or Aria is a saint\" must be false. However, this statement is a tautology and cannot be false.\n\nSince Case 2 leads to a contradiction, the only consistent scenario is Case 1.\n\nTherefore, the solution is: \n\n<<<Aria is a saint, and Sofia is a saint>>>"
