    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Alexander and Sofia:\n\n1. Alexander says: \"Sofia is a saint and Sofia is a sinner.\"\n2. Sofia says: \"Alexander is a saint.\"\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- If Alexander is a saint (truth-teller), then his statement \"Sofia is a saint and Sofia is a sinner\" must be true. However, this statement is a contradiction because Sofia cannot be both a saint and a sinner at the same time. Therefore, Alexander cannot be a saint.\n\n- Since Alexander cannot be a saint, he must be a sinner (liar). This means his statement \"Sofia is a saint and Sofia is a sinner\" is false. Therefore, Sofia is not both a saint and a sinner, which is consistent with the rules.\n\n- Now, since Alexander is a sinner, Sofia's statement \"Alexander is a saint\" must be false. This means Sofia is telling the truth, so she must be a saint.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n<<<Alexander is a sinner, and Sofia is a saint>>>"
