  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by sages and fools. Sages always tell the truth, and fools always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Logan, and Jacob. Logan noted, \"if Jacob is a sage then Logan is a sage\". Jacob said that Logan is a sage. So who is a sage and who is a fool? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Logan is a sage/fool, and Jacob is a sage/fool>>>)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Logan and Jacob.\n\n1. **Logan's Statement:** \"If Jacob is a sage, then Logan is a sage.\"\n   - This is a logical implication: \\( J \\rightarrow L \\), where \\( J \\) is \"Jacob is a sage\" and \\( L \\) is \"Logan is a sage\".\n   - The implication \\( J \\rightarrow L \\) is logically equivalent to \\( \\neg J \\lor L \\) (not Jacob or Logan).\n\n2. **Jacob's Statement:** \"Logan is a sage.\"\n   - This is a direct statement: \\( L \\).\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n- **Case 1:** Assume Jacob is a sage.\n  - If Jacob is a sage, then his statement that \"Logan is a sage\" must be true. So, Logan is a sage.\n  - If Logan is a sage, then Logan's statement \"If Jacob is a sage, then Logan is a sage\" is true, which is consistent.\n  - Therefore, if Jacob is a sage, both Jacob and Logan are sages.\n\n- **Case 2:** Assume Jacob is a fool.\n  - If Jacob is a fool, then his statement that \"Logan is a sage\" must be false. So, Logan is a fool.\n  - If Logan is a fool, then Logan's statement \"If Jacob is a sage, then Logan is a sage\" must be false.\n  - The statement \\( J \\rightarrow L \\) is false only if Jacob is a sage and Logan is a fool, which contradicts our assumption that Jacob is a fool.\n  - Therefore, Jacob cannot be a fool.\n\nFrom the analysis, the only consistent scenario is that both Jacob and Logan are sages.\n\nThus, the answer is: <<<Logan is a sage, and Jacob is a sage>>>."
