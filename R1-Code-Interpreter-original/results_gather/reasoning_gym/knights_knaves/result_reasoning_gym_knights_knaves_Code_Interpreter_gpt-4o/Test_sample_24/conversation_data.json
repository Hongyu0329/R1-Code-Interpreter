    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Aria and Jacob.\n\n1. Aria says, \"Jacob is a saint.\"\n2. Jacob says, \"Aria is a sinner and Aria is a saint.\"\n\nLet's consider the possibilities:\n\n- If Aria is a saint, then her statement \"Jacob is a saint\" must be true. Therefore, Jacob is a saint. However, if Jacob is a saint, his statement \"Aria is a sinner and Aria is a saint\" is a contradiction because a person cannot be both a sinner and a saint. Therefore, Aria cannot be a saint.\n\n- If Aria is a sinner, then her statement \"Jacob is a saint\" is false. Therefore, Jacob is a sinner. If Jacob is a sinner, his statement \"Aria is a sinner and Aria is a saint\" is false. Since the statement is false, it means that not both parts of the statement can be true. Since Aria is indeed a sinner, the false part must be \"Aria is a saint,\" which is consistent with our assumption that Aria is a sinner.\n\nTherefore, the only consistent scenario is that Aria is a sinner and Jacob is a sinner.\n\nThus, the answer is: <<<Aria is a sinner, and Jacob is a sinner>>>."
