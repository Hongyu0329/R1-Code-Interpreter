  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by sages and fools. Sages always tell the truth, and fools always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Daniel, and Sebastian. Daniel asserted: \"Sebastian is a sage and Daniel is a sage\". Sebastian commented, \"Daniel is a fool if and only if Daniel is a sage\". So who is a sage and who is a fool? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Daniel is a sage/fool, and Sebastian is a sage/fool>>>)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Daniel and Sebastian.\n\n1. **Daniel's Statement**: \"Sebastian is a sage and Daniel is a sage.\"\n   - If Daniel is a sage, then his statement is true, which means both Daniel and Sebastian are sages.\n   - If Daniel is a fool, then his statement is false, which means at least one of them is a fool.\n\n2. **Sebastian's Statement**: \"Daniel is a fool if and only if Daniel is a sage.\"\n   - This is a biconditional statement, which means it is true if both parts are either true or false.\n   - If Sebastian is a sage, then his statement is true. This means Daniel is a fool if and only if Daniel is a sage, which is a contradiction. Therefore, Sebastian cannot be a sage.\n   - If Sebastian is a fool, then his statement is false. This means Daniel is not a fool if and only if Daniel is not a sage, which is consistent if Daniel is a sage.\n\nFrom the analysis:\n- If Daniel is a sage, then his statement is true, and Sebastian must also be a sage, which contradicts the analysis of Sebastian's statement.\n- Therefore, Daniel must be a fool, making his statement false, which means at least one of them is a fool. Since Daniel is a fool, Sebastian must be a sage.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n<<<Daniel is a fool, and Sebastian is a sage>>>"
