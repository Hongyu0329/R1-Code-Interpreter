  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by sages and fools. Sages always tell the truth, and fools always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Abigail, and Lily. \"Lily is a sage,\" Abigail mentioned. As Lily put it, \"Abigail is a fool or Abigail is a sage\". So who is a sage and who is a fool? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Abigail is a sage/fool, and Lily is a sage/fool>>>)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Abigail and Lily.\n\n1. Abigail says, \"Lily is a sage.\"\n2. Lily says, \"Abigail is a fool or Abigail is a sage.\"\n\nLet's consider the possibilities:\n\n- **Case 1: Abigail is a sage.**\n  - If Abigail is a sage, then her statement \"Lily is a sage\" must be true. Therefore, Lily is a sage.\n  - If Lily is a sage, then her statement \"Abigail is a fool or Abigail is a sage\" must be true. Since Abigail is a sage, the statement is true because \"Abigail is a sage\" is true.\n\n- **Case 2: Abigail is a fool.**\n  - If Abigail is a fool, then her statement \"Lily is a sage\" must be false. Therefore, Lily is a fool.\n  - If Lily is a fool, then her statement \"Abigail is a fool or Abigail is a sage\" must be false. However, this statement is always true because it covers all possibilities (Abigail being either a fool or a sage). Therefore, Lily cannot be a fool.\n\nSince Case 2 leads to a contradiction, the only consistent scenario is Case 1.\n\nTherefore, the solution is: <<<Abigail is a sage, and Lily is a sage>>>."
