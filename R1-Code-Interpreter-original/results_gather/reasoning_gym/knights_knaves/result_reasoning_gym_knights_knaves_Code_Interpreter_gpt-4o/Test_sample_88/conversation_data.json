  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Emily, and Abigail. According to Emily, \"Abigail is a knight or Emily is a knight\". Abigail said that Emily is a knave if and only if Abigail is a knight. So who is a knight and who is a knave? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Emily is a knight/knave, and Abigail is a knight/knave>>>)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Emily and Abigail.\n\n1. Emily says: \"Abigail is a knight or Emily is a knight.\"\n2. Abigail says: \"Emily is a knave if and only if Abigail is a knight.\"\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- If Emily is a knight, her statement is true. This means \"Abigail is a knight or Emily is a knight\" is true. Since Emily is a knight, the statement holds true regardless of Abigail's status.\n\n- If Emily is a knave, her statement is false. This means \"Abigail is a knight or Emily is a knight\" is false. Since Emily is a knave, \"Emily is a knight\" is false, so \"Abigail is a knight\" must also be false, making Abigail a knave.\n\nNow, let's analyze Abigail's statement:\n\n- Abigail says: \"Emily is a knave if and only if Abigail is a knight.\"\n  - This is a biconditional statement, which means both sides must have the same truth value.\n  - If Abigail is a knight, her statement is true, so \"Emily is a knave\" must also be true, making Emily a knave.\n  - If Abigail is a knave, her statement is false, so \"Emily is a knave\" must be false, making Emily a knight.\n\nLet's consider the possibilities:\n\n1. If Emily is a knight:\n   - Her statement is true, so \"Abigail is a knight or Emily is a knight\" is true.\n   - Abigail's statement must also be true, so \"Emily is a knave if and only if Abigail is a knight\" is true.\n   - This means Abigail is a knave (since Emily is not a knave).\n\n2. If Emily is a knave:\n   - Her statement is false, so \"Abigail is a knight or Emily is a knight\" is false.\n   - Abigail's statement must be false, so \"Emily is a knave if and only if Abigail is a knight\" is false.\n   - This means Abigail is a knave (since Emily is a knave).\n\nIn both scenarios, Abigail is a knave. Therefore, Emily must be a knight.\n\nThus, the solution is: <<<Emily is a knight, and Abigail is a knave>>>."
