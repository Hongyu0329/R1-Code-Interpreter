  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by altruists and egoists. Altruists always tell the truth, and egoists always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Riley, and Lily. Riley commented, \"Riley is an altruist if and only if Lily is an altruist\". In Lily's words: \"Riley is an egoist\". So who is an altruist and who is an egoist? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Riley is a altruist/egoist, and Lily is a altruist/egoist>>>)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Riley and Lily.\n\n1. Riley says, \"Riley is an altruist if and only if Lily is an altruist.\"\n   - This is a biconditional statement, which means both parts must be true or both must be false.\n\n2. Lily says, \"Riley is an egoist.\"\n   - If Lily is an altruist, she tells the truth, so Riley is indeed an egoist.\n   - If Lily is an egoist, she lies, so Riley is an altruist.\n\nLet's analyze the possibilities:\n\n- **Case 1**: Assume Riley is an altruist.\n  - Then Riley's statement \"Riley is an altruist if and only if Lily is an altruist\" must be true.\n  - This means Lily must also be an altruist.\n  - But if Lily is an altruist, her statement \"Riley is an egoist\" would be true, which contradicts our assumption that Riley is an altruist.\n\n- **Case 2**: Assume Riley is an egoist.\n  - Then Riley's statement \"Riley is an altruist if and only if Lily is an altruist\" must be false.\n  - This means Lily is not an altruist, so Lily is an egoist.\n  - If Lily is an egoist, her statement \"Riley is an egoist\" is a lie, which means Riley is actually an altruist.\n\nBoth cases lead to contradictions, so let's re-evaluate:\n\n- If Riley is an egoist, his statement is false, meaning Lily is not an altruist, so Lily is an egoist.\n- If Lily is an egoist, her statement \"Riley is an egoist\" is false, meaning Riley is an altruist.\n\nTherefore, the consistent solution is:\n\n- Riley is an altruist.\n- Lily is an egoist.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<Riley is an altruist, and Lily is an egoist>>>"
