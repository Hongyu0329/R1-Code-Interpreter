  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by angels and devils. Angels always tell the truth, and devils always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: Emma, and Jackson. Emma said, \"Jackson is an angel if and only if Emma is an angel.\" Jackson remarked, \"Emma is an angel\". So who is an angel and who is a devil? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<Emma is a angel/devil, and Jackson is a angel/devil>>>)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Emma and Jackson.\n\n1. **Emma's Statement**: \"Jackson is an angel if and only if Emma is an angel.\"\n   - This is a biconditional statement, which means both parts must be true or both must be false.\n   - If Emma is an angel (truth-teller), then her statement is true, which means Jackson is also an angel.\n   - If Emma is a devil (liar), then her statement is false, which means Jackson is not an angel (i.e., Jackson is a devil).\n\n2. **Jackson's Statement**: \"Emma is an angel.\"\n   - If Jackson is an angel (truth-teller), then his statement is true, which means Emma is an angel.\n   - If Jackson is a devil (liar), then his statement is false, which means Emma is not an angel (i.e., Emma is a devil).\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1**: Emma is an angel.\n  - If Emma is an angel, then her statement is true, which means Jackson is also an angel.\n  - If Jackson is an angel, then his statement is true, which means Emma is an angel.\n  - This scenario is consistent.\n\n- **Scenario 2**: Emma is a devil.\n  - If Emma is a devil, then her statement is false, which means Jackson is a devil.\n  - If Jackson is a devil, then his statement is false, which means Emma is not an angel (i.e., Emma is a devil).\n  - This scenario is also consistent.\n\nHowever, we need to determine which scenario is correct. Since both scenarios are consistent, we need to find a contradiction in one of them.\n\nLet's consider the implications:\n- If Emma is an angel, then both are angels, which is consistent.\n- If Emma is a devil, then both are devils, which is also consistent.\n\nSince both scenarios are consistent, we need to find a logical contradiction. However, the problem is structured such that one scenario must be true. Given the nature of the statements, the only consistent scenario without contradiction is that both are angels.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n<<<Emma is an angel, and Jackson is an angel>>>"
