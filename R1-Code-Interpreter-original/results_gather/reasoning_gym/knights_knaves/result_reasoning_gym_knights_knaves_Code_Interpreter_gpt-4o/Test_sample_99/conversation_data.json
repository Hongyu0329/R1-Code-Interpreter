    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Elizabeth and Mason.\n\n1. Elizabeth says, \"Mason is a sinner.\"\n2. Mason says, \"Elizabeth is a sinner and Elizabeth is a saint.\"\n\nLet's consider the possibilities:\n\n- If Elizabeth is a saint, then her statement must be true. Therefore, Mason is a sinner. However, if Mason is a sinner, his statement must be false. But Mason's statement is self-contradictory (\"Elizabeth is a sinner and Elizabeth is a saint\"), which is consistent with him being a sinner.\n\n- If Elizabeth is a sinner, then her statement must be false. Therefore, Mason is a saint. However, if Mason is a saint, his statement must be true. But Mason's statement is self-contradictory, which cannot be true.\n\nTherefore, the only consistent scenario is that Elizabeth is a saint and Mason is a sinner.\n\nThus, the answer is: <<<Elizabeth is a saint, and Mason is a sinner>>>."
