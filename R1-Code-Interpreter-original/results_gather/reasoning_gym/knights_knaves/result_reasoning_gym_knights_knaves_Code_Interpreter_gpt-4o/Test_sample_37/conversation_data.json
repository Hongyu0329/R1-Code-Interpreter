  "question": "A very special island is inhabited only by sages and fools. Sages always tell the truth, and fools always lie. You meet 2 inhabitants: David, and Jacob. David said that Jacob is a fool if and only if Jacob is a sage. Jacob stated, \"David is a fool\". So who is a sage and who is a fool? (Enclose your answer in triple angle brackets like: <<<David is a sage/fool, and Jacob is a sage/fool>>>)",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, let's analyze the statements made by David and Jacob.\n\n1. **David's Statement**: \"Jacob is a fool if and only if Jacob is a sage.\"\n\n   This statement can be broken down into two parts:\n   - If Jacob is a fool, then Jacob is a sage.\n   - If Jacob is a sage, then Jacob is a fool.\n\n   This is a contradiction because someone cannot be both a sage and a fool at the same time. Therefore, David's statement is inherently false.\n\n2. **Jacob's Statement**: \"David is a fool.\"\n\n   Let's consider the possibilities:\n\n   - If Jacob is a sage, then his statement is true, which means David is a fool.\n   - If Jacob is a fool, then his statement is false, which means David is a sage.\n\nGiven that David's statement is false, David must be a fool. Therefore, Jacob's statement that \"David is a fool\" is true, which means Jacob is a sage.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n<<<David is a fool, and Jacob is a sage>>>"
