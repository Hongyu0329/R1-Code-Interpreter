    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the statements made by Elizabeth and Ethan.\n\n1. Elizabeth says, \"Ethan is a sinner.\"\n2. Ethan says, \"If Ethan is a saint, then Elizabeth is a sinner.\"\n\nLet's consider the possibilities:\n\n- **Case 1**: Elizabeth is a saint.\n  - If Elizabeth is a saint, she tells the truth. Therefore, Ethan must be a sinner.\n  - If Ethan is a sinner, his statement is false. The statement \"If Ethan is a saint, then Elizabeth is a sinner\" is false only if Ethan is a saint and Elizabeth is not a sinner. However, since Ethan is a sinner, this condition does not apply, and the statement is false.\n\n- **Case 2**: Elizabeth is a sinner.\n  - If Elizabeth is a sinner, she lies. Therefore, Ethan must be a saint.\n  - If Ethan is a saint, his statement is true. The statement \"If Ethan is a saint, then Elizabeth is a sinner\" is true because Elizabeth is indeed a sinner.\n\nFrom the analysis, we can see that both cases are consistent with the given statements. However, only Case 2 satisfies all conditions without contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n<<<Elizabeth is a sinner, and Ethan is a saint>>>"
