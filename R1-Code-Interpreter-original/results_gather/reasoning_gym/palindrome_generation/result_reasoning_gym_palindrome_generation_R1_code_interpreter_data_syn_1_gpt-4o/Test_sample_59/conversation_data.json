    "To form a palindrome, we need to ensure that the sequence of letters reads the same forwards and backwards. \n\nGiven the letters: z, p, z, p\n\n1. Count the occurrences of each letter:\n   - 'z' appears 2 times.\n   - 'p' appears 2 times.\n\n2. For a string to be a palindrome:\n   - If the length of the string is even, each character must appear an even number of times.\n   - If the length of the string is odd, only one character can appear an odd number of times, and all others must appear an even number of times.\n\n3. In this case, we have an even number of letters (4), and each letter appears an even number of times, which is suitable for forming a palindrome.\n\n4. We can arrange the letters as follows to form a palindrome: \"zp\" + \"pz\" = \"zppz\"\n\nLet's verify this by writing a small Python script to ensure the palindrome condition is met.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef can_form_palindrome(letters):\n    count = Counter(letters)\n    odd_count = sum(1 for c in count.values() if c % 2 != 0)\n    return odd_count <= 1\n\nletters = ['z', 'p', 'z', 'p']\nif can_form_palindrome(letters):\n    palindrome = \"zp\" + \"pz\"\n    print(palindrome)\nelse:\n    print(\"Cannot form a palindrome\")\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to confirm the palindrome formation.",
    "The code executed successfully and confirmed that the letters can be arranged to form the palindrome \"zppz\". \n\nTherefore, the valid palindrome using the given letters is:\n\n<<<zppz>>>"
