    "To form a palindrome, we need to arrange the letters such that the sequence reads the same forwards and backwards. \n\nGiven the letters: w, x, w\n\n1. A palindrome can have at most one character with an odd count in the middle, while all other characters must have even counts to be symmetrically placed around the center.\n2. In this case, we have:\n   - 'w' appears twice.\n   - 'x' appears once.\n\n3. We can place 'x' in the middle and 'w' on both sides to form the palindrome.\n\nLet's verify this by constructing the palindrome:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef form_palindrome(letters):\n    count = Counter(letters)\n    odd_count = sum(1 for c in count if count[c] % 2 != 0)\n    \n    if odd_count > 1:\n        return \"Not possible to form a palindrome\"\n    \n    half_palindrome = []\n    middle = \"\"\n    \n    for char, cnt in count.items():\n        if cnt % 2 != 0:\n            middle = char\n        half_palindrome.append(char * (cnt // 2))\n    \n    half_palindrome = ''.join(half_palindrome)\n    return half_palindrome + middle + half_palindrome[::-1]\n\nletters = ['w', 'x', 'w']\npalindrome = form_palindrome(letters)\nprint(palindrome)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the palindrome \"wxw\". This confirms that the letters 'w', 'x', 'w' can be arranged to form the palindrome \"wxw\".\n\nThus, the valid palindrome using the given letters is:\n\n<<<wxw>>>"
