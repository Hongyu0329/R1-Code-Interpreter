    "To form a palindrome, we need to arrange the letters such that the sequence reads the same forwards and backwards. \n\nGiven the letters: j, j, t\n\n1. A palindrome can have at most one character with an odd count in the middle, while all other characters must have even counts to be symmetrically placed around the center.\n2. In this case, we have:\n   - 'j' appears twice (even count)\n   - 't' appears once (odd count)\n\n3. We can place 't' in the middle and 'j' on both sides to form a palindrome.\n\nLet's construct the palindrome:\n\n- Place 't' in the center.\n- Place 'j' on both sides of 't'.\n\nThe resulting palindrome is \"jtj\".\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer:\n\n<<<jtj>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Your task is, given a list of letters, to form a valid palindrome.\n\nA palindrome is a phrase that reads the same forwards and backwards.\n\nIf there are multiple possible answers, only respond with one of them.
