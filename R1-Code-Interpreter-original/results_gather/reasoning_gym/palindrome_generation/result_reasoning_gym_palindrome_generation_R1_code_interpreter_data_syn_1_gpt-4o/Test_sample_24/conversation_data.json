    "To form a palindrome, we need to arrange the letters such that the sequence reads the same forwards and backwards. \n\nGiven the letters: q, m, m\n\n1. **Count the occurrences of each letter**: \n   - 'q' appears 1 time.\n   - 'm' appears 2 times.\n\n2. **Determine the structure of the palindrome**:\n   - A palindrome can have at most one character with an odd count (which will be placed in the center if the palindrome length is odd).\n   - In this case, 'q' has an odd count, and 'm' has an even count.\n\n3. **Form the palindrome**:\n   - Place 'm' on both sides of the palindrome.\n   - Place 'q' in the center.\n\nThus, the palindrome can be formed as \"mqm\".\n\nLet's verify this with a simple code to ensure correctness.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef form_palindrome(letters):\n    count = Counter(letters)\n    odd_char = [char for char, cnt in count.items() if cnt % 2 == 1]\n    even_chars = [char for char, cnt in count.items() if cnt % 2 == 0]\n    \n    # Start forming the palindrome\n    half_palindrome = []\n    for char, cnt in count.items():\n        half_palindrome.append(char * (cnt // 2))\n    \n    # Join the half palindrome\n    half_palindrome = ''.join(half_palindrome)\n    \n    # If there's an odd character, it goes in the middle\n    if odd_char:\n        palindrome = half_palindrome + odd_char[0] + half_palindrome[::-1]\n    else:\n        palindrome = half_palindrome + half_palindrome[::-1]\n    \n    return palindrome\n\nletters = ['q', 'm', 'm']\npalindrome = form_palindrome(letters)\nprint(palindrome)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to confirm the palindrome.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the palindrome \"mqm\". This confirms that the letters 'q', 'm', 'm' can be arranged to form the palindrome \"mqm\".\n\nThus, the valid palindrome using the given letters is:\n\n<<<mqm>>>"
