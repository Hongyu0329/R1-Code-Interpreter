    "To form a palindrome, we need to arrange the letters such that the sequence reads the same forwards and backwards. \n\nGiven the letters: o, o, k\n\n1. A palindrome can have at most one character with an odd count, which would be placed in the center if the length of the string is odd.\n2. The rest of the characters should have even counts and be symmetrically placed around the center.\n\nLet's analyze the given letters:\n- 'o' appears twice.\n- 'k' appears once.\n\nSince 'o' appears an even number of times, it can be symmetrically placed around the center. 'k' appears once, which is an odd count, so it can be placed in the center.\n\nThus, a possible palindrome arrangement is \"oko\".\n\nLet's verify this by writing a small script to ensure the arrangement is correct.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef form_palindrome(letters):\n    count = Counter(letters)\n    odd_count = sum(1 for c in count if count[c] % 2 != 0)\n    \n    if odd_count > 1:\n        return None\n    \n    half_palindrome = []\n    middle = ''\n    \n    for char, cnt in count.items():\n        if cnt % 2 != 0:\n            middle = char\n        half_palindrome.append(char * (cnt // 2))\n    \n    half_palindrome = ''.join(half_palindrome)\n    return half_palindrome + middle + half_palindrome[::-1]\n\nletters = ['o', 'o', 'k']\npalindrome = form_palindrome(letters)\nprint(palindrome)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to confirm the palindrome.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the palindrome \"oko\". This confirms that the arrangement of the letters \"o, o, k\" into the palindrome \"oko\" is valid.\n\nThus, the valid palindrome formed using the given letters is:\n\n<<<oko>>>"
