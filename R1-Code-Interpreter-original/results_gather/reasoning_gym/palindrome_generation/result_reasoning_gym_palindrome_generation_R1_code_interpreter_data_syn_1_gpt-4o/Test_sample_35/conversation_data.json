    "To form a palindrome, we need to ensure that the sequence of letters reads the same forwards and backwards. Given the letters: d, k, k, d, we can observe that there are two 'd's and two 'k's. \n\nA palindrome can be formed by placing the same letters symmetrically around the center. In this case, we can place 'd' at both ends and 'k' in the middle, or vice versa. \n\nLet's construct the palindrome:\n\n1. Place 'd' at the start and end.\n2. Place 'k' next to each 'd'.\n\nThis will form the palindrome \"dkkd\".\n\nNow, let's verify this using a simple Python script to ensure that the constructed string is indeed a palindrome.\n\n```python\ndef is_palindrome(s):\n    return s == s[::-1]\n\nletters = ['d', 'k', 'k', 'd']\npalindrome = ''.join(letters)\n\nprint(is_palindrome(palindrome), palindrome)\n```\n\nThis code will check if the constructed string is a palindrome and print the result along with the palindrome itself. Let's execute this code to confirm our solution.",
    "The code output confirms that \"dkkd\" is indeed a palindrome. Since the task is to form a valid palindrome using the given letters, and we have verified that \"dkkd\" meets the criteria, we can confidently provide the final answer.\n\n<<<dkkd>>>"
