You must use all the letters provided.\n\nYour output should be a single string, with no spaces or punctuation, and enclose it within triple angle brackets, like <<<single string>>>.\n\nNow, form a valid palindrome using the following letters: y, r, i, i, r, c, y, c\n",

    "\nassistant > To form a palindrome, the letters must be arranged such that they read the same forwards and backwards. Given the letters: y, r, i, i, r, c, y, c, we can arrange them as follows:\n\n- The letters 'y', 'r', 'i', 'c' can be mirrored around the center.\n- The center can be formed by the letter 'i', which appears twice.\n\nThus, one possible palindrome is \"yrciicry\".\n\nHere is the palindrome enclosed within triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<yrciicry>>>"
