    "\nassistant > To form a palindrome, we need to arrange the letters such that the sequence reads the same forwards and backwards. Given the letters: n, k, a, k, j, n, a, j, we can form the palindrome by arranging them symmetrically around a center.\n\nLet's construct the palindrome: \n\n- We can pair the letters: n with n, k with k, a with a, and j with j.\n\nThus, one possible palindrome is: \"najjkkan\".\n\nSo, the palindrome is:\n\n<<<najjkkan>>>"
