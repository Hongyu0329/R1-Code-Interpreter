    "\nassistant > To form a palindrome, the letters must be arranged such that they read the same forwards and backwards. Let's analyze the given letters: h, t, t, t, w, h, t, w.\n\n1. Count the occurrences of each letter:\n   - h: 2\n   - t: 4\n   - w: 2\n\n2. For a string to be a palindrome:\n   - If the length of the string is even, all characters must occur an even number of times.\n   - If the length of the string is odd, all characters except one must occur an even number of times (the character with an odd count will be in the middle).\n\nIn this case, the length of the string is 8, which is even. Therefore, all characters must occur an even number of times, which they do.\n\nNow, let's construct the palindrome. We can place the letters symmetrically around the center. \n\nOne possible palindrome is: \"thwttwht\".\n\nSo, the palindrome is:\n\n<<<thwttwht>>>"
