You must use all the letters provided.\n\nYour output should be a single string, with no spaces or punctuation, and enclose it within triple angle brackets, like <<<single string>>>.\n\nNow, form a valid palindrome using the following letters: h, k, m, k, h, v, p, v, m, p\n",

    "\nassistant > To form a palindrome, we need to ensure that the sequence of letters reads the same forwards and backwards. This means that each letter must have a matching pair, except for at most one letter, which can be in the middle if the total number of letters is odd.\n\nLet's analyze the given letters: h, k, m, k, h, v, p, v, m, p.\n\n- h: 2\n- k: 2\n- m: 2\n- v: 2\n- p: 2\n\nAll letters have even counts, which means we can pair them up perfectly to form a palindrome. \n\nOne possible palindrome is: hkmvpvkmh\n\nLet's format it as requested: <<<hkmvpvkmh>>>"
