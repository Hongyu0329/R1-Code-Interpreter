You must use all the letters provided.\n\nYour output should be a single string, with no spaces or punctuation, and enclose it within triple angle brackets, like <<<single string>>>.\n\nNow, form a valid palindrome using the following letters: o, o, n, n, z, u, g, g, u\n",

    "\nassistant > To form a palindrome, we need to arrange the letters such that the sequence reads the same forwards and backwards. A palindrome can have at most one character with an odd frequency, which would be placed in the center if the total number of characters is odd.\n\nLet's analyze the given letters: o, o, n, n, z, u, g, g, u.\n\n- o: 2 occurrences\n- n: 2 occurrences\n- z: 1 occurrence\n- u: 2 occurrences\n- g: 2 occurrences\n\nThe letter 'z' has an odd frequency, so it will be placed in the center. The other letters can be symmetrically arranged around it.\n\nOne possible palindrome is \"oungzgnuo\". Let's format it as requested:\n\n<<<oungzgnuo>>>"
