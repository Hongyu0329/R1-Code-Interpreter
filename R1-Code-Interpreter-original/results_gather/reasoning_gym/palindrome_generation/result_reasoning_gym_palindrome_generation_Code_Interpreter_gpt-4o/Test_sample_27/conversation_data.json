    "\nassistant > To form a palindrome, the letters must be arranged such that they read the same forwards and backwards. Given the letters: q, l, c, q, l, c, we can arrange them as follows:\n\n- The letters 'q', 'l', and 'c' each appear twice, which allows us to place them symmetrically around the center.\n\nA valid palindrome arrangement is: \"qlccql\".\n\nThus, the palindrome is:\n\n<<<qlccql>>>"
