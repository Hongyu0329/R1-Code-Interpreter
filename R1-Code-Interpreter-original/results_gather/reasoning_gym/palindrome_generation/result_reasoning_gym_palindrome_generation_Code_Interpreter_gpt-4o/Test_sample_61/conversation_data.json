    "\nassistant > To form a palindrome, each letter must appear an even number of times, except for at most one letter, which can appear an odd number of times and be placed in the center of the palindrome.\n\nGiven the letters: c, s, w, d, x, x, d, w, s, c\n\nLet's count the occurrences of each letter:\n\n- c: 2\n- s: 2\n- w: 2\n- d: 2\n- x: 2\n\nSince all letters appear an even number of times, we can form a palindrome by arranging them symmetrically.\n\nOne possible palindrome is: \"cswdxxdwsc\"\n\nThus, the palindrome is:\n\n<<<cswdxxdwsc>>>"
