    "\nassistant > To form a palindrome, the letters must be arranged such that they read the same forwards and backwards. Given the letters: x, o, o, j, x, j, we can form the palindrome by arranging them as follows:\n\n- Place the letters 'x' and 'j' symmetrically at the ends.\n- Place the letters 'o' in the middle.\n\nOne possible palindrome is \"xojjox\".\n\nThus, the palindrome is:\n\n<<<xojjox>>>"
