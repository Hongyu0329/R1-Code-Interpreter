    "\nassistant > To form a palindrome, we need to arrange the letters such that the sequence reads the same forwards and backwards. Given the letters: x, b, a, b, a, u, x, u, we can form the palindrome by arranging them as follows:\n\n- The letters 'x', 'b', 'a', 'u' can be mirrored around the center.\n- The center can be any letter that appears an odd number of times.\n\nLet's construct the palindrome:\n\n- Mirror the sequence: \"x\", \"b\", \"a\", \"u\" | \"u\", \"a\", \"b\", \"x\"\n\nThe palindrome formed is \"xubaubax\".\n\nThus, the valid palindrome is:\n\n<<<xubaubax>>>"
