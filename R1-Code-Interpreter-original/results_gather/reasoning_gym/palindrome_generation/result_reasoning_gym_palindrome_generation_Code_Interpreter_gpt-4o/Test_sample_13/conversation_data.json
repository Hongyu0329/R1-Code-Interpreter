  "question": "Your task is, given a list of letters, to form a valid palindrome.\n\nA palindrome is a phrase that reads the same forwards and backwards.\n\nIf there are multiple possible answers, only respond with one of them. You must use all the letters provided.\n\nYour output should be a single string, with no spaces or punctuation, and enclose it within triple angle brackets, like <<<single string>>>.\n\nNow, form a valid palindrome using the following letters: k, a, k, h, g, g, h\n",

    "\nassistant > To form a palindrome, we need to arrange the letters such that the sequence reads the same forwards and backwards. Given the letters: k, a, k, h, g, g, h, we can form the palindrome by arranging them symmetrically around the center.\n\nOne possible palindrome is \"hggahgg\". Let's verify and construct it. \n\n- The letters 'h' and 'h' can be placed at the start and end.\n- The letters 'g' and 'g' can be placed next to 'h' on both sides.\n- The letter 'a' can be placed in the center.\n- The letters 'k' and 'k' can be placed symmetrically around 'a'.\n\nThus, the palindrome is \"hggahgg\".\n\nHere is the palindrome enclosed within triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<hggahgg>>>"
