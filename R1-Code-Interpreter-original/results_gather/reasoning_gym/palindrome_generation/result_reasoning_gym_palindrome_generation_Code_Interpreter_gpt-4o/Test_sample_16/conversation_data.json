    "\nassistant > To form a palindrome, the letters must be arranged such that they read the same forwards and backwards. Given the letters: y, h, d, s, y, h, d, s, we can arrange them as follows:\n\n- First, pair the letters symmetrically around the center.\n- The letters can be arranged as: y, h, d, s, s, d, h, y.\n\nThis arrangement reads the same forwards and backwards, forming a valid palindrome.\n\nHere is the palindrome enclosed within triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<yhdssdhy>>>"
