You must use all the letters provided.\n\nYour output should be a single string, with no spaces or punctuation, and enclose it within triple angle brackets, like <<<single string>>>.\n\nNow, form a valid palindrome using the following letters: n, j, n, j, d, j, s, s, d\n",

    "\nassistant > To form a palindrome, we need to arrange the letters such that the sequence reads the same forwards and backwards. A palindrome can have at most one character with an odd count, which would be placed in the center if the total number of characters is odd.\n\nLet's analyze the given letters: n, j, n, j, d, j, s, s, d.\n\n- n: 2 occurrences\n- j: 3 occurrences\n- d: 2 occurrences\n- s: 2 occurrences\n\nThe letter 'j' has an odd count, so it will be placed in the center. The other letters can be symmetrically arranged around it.\n\nA possible palindrome is: \"ndsjjsdn\".\n\nLet's format it as requested: <<<ndsjjsdn>>>."
