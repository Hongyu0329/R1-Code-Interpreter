    "\nassistant > To form a valid palindrome using the letters y, y, z, a, a, we need to arrange them such that the sequence reads the same forwards and backwards. \n\nA palindrome can have at most one character with an odd count, which would be placed in the center. In this case, the letter 'z' appears once, so it can be placed in the center. The letters 'y' and 'a' each appear twice, so they can be symmetrically placed around 'z'.\n\nOne possible palindrome is \"ayzya\".\n\nHere is the palindrome enclosed within triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<ayzya>>>"
