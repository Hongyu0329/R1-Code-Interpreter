    "\nassistant > To form a palindrome, the letters must be arranged such that they read the same forwards and backwards. Given the letters: a, a, v, a, x, a, x, we can arrange them as follows:\n\n- The middle of the palindrome can be the letter 'v', as it appears only once.\n- The letters 'a' and 'x' can be symmetrically placed around 'v'.\n\nOne possible palindrome is: \"axaavxaa\".\n\nThus, the palindrome is:\n\n<<<axaavxaa>>>"
