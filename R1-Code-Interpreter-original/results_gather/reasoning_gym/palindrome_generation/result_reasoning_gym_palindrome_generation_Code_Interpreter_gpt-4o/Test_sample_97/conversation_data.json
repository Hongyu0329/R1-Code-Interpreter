You must use all the letters provided.\n\nYour output should be a single string, with no spaces or punctuation, and enclose it within triple angle brackets, like <<<single string>>>.\n\nNow, form a valid palindrome using the following letters: x, x, s, b, b, s, m\n",

    "\nassistant > To form a palindrome, we need to arrange the letters such that the sequence reads the same forwards and backwards. A palindrome can have at most one character with an odd count, which would be placed in the center if the total number of characters is odd.\n\nGiven the letters: x, x, s, b, b, s, m\n\nLet's count the occurrences of each letter:\n- x: 2\n- s: 2\n- b: 2\n- m: 1\n\nSince 'm' appears an odd number of times, it can be placed in the center. The other letters can be symmetrically arranged around it.\n\nOne possible palindrome is: \"xsmbbsx\"\n\nThus, the palindrome is:\n\n<<<xsmbbsx>>>"
