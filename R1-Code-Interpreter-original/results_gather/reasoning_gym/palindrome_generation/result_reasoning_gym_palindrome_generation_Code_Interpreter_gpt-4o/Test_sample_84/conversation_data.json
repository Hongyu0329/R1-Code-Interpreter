You must use all the letters provided.\n\nYour output should be a single string, with no spaces or punctuation, and enclose it within triple angle brackets, like <<<single string>>>.\n\nNow, form a valid palindrome using the following letters: p, q, t, a, t, q, a\n",

    "\nassistant > To form a palindrome, we need to arrange the letters such that the sequence reads the same forwards and backwards. A palindrome can have at most one character with an odd frequency, which would be placed in the center if the total number of characters is odd.\n\nLet's analyze the given letters: p, q, t, a, t, q, a.\n\n- p: 1 occurrence\n- q: 2 occurrences\n- t: 2 occurrences\n- a: 2 occurrences\n\nSince 'p' occurs only once, it can be placed in the center. The other letters can be symmetrically arranged around it.\n\nOne possible palindrome is: \"qatptaq\".\n\nThus, the palindrome formed is:\n\n<<<qatptaq>>>"
