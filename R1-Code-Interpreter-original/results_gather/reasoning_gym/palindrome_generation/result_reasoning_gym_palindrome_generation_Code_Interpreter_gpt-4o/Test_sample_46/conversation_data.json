You must use all the letters provided.\n\nYour output should be a single string, with no spaces or punctuation, and enclose it within triple angle brackets, like <<<single string>>>.\n\nNow, form a valid palindrome using the following letters: s, s, c, c, y, y\n",

    "\nassistant > To form a valid palindrome, we need to arrange the letters such that the sequence reads the same forwards and backwards. Given the letters: s, s, c, c, y, y, we can form the palindrome by arranging them symmetrically around the center.\n\nOne possible palindrome is \"syccys\". Therefore, the output is:\n\n<<<syccys>>>"
