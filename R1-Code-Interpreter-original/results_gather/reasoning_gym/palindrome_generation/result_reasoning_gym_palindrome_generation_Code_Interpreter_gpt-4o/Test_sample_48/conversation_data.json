    "\nassistant > To form a palindrome, we need to arrange the letters such that the sequence reads the same forwards and backwards. A palindrome can have at most one character with an odd frequency, which would be placed in the center if the length of the sequence is odd.\n\nGiven the letters: w, k, w, n, x, k, x\n\nLet's count the frequency of each letter:\n- w: 2\n- k: 2\n- x: 2\n- n: 1\n\nSince 'n' appears only once, it can be placed in the center. The other letters can be symmetrically arranged around it.\n\nOne possible palindrome is: \"wkxnxkw\"\n\nThus, the palindrome formed is:\n\n<<<wkxnxkw>>>"
