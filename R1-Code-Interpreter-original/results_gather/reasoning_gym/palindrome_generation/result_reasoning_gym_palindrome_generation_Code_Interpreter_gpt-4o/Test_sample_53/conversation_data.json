You must use all the letters provided.\n\nYour output should be a single string, with no spaces or punctuation, and enclose it within triple angle brackets, like <<<single string>>>.\n\nNow, form a valid palindrome using the following letters: v, s, i, v, s, i\n",

    "\nassistant > To form a palindrome, the letters must be arranged such that they read the same forwards and backwards. Given the letters \"v, s, i, v, s, i\", we can arrange them as follows:\n\n- The letters \"v\" and \"s\" can be placed symmetrically around the center.\n- The letters \"i\" can be placed in the center.\n\nOne possible palindrome is \"vsiiisv\".\n\nThus, the palindrome formed is:\n\n<<<vsiiisv>>>"
