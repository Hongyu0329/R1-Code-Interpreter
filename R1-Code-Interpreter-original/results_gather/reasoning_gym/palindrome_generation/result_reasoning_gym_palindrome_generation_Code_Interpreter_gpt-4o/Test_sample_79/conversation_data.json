You must use all the letters provided.\n\nYour output should be a single string, with no spaces or punctuation, and enclose it within triple angle brackets, like <<<single string>>>.\n\nNow, form a valid palindrome using the following letters: f, i, i, f, x, x\n",

    "\nassistant > To form a palindrome, the letters must be arranged such that they read the same forwards and backwards. For the given letters: f, i, i, f, x, x, we can arrange them as follows:\n\n- The letters 'f' and 'x' can be placed symmetrically at the ends.\n- The letters 'i' can be placed symmetrically in the middle.\n\nThus, one possible palindrome is \"fixxif\".\n\nHere is the palindrome enclosed within triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<fixxif>>>"
