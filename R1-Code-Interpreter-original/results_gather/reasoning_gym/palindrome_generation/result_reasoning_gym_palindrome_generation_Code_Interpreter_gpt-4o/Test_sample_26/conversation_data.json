    "\nassistant > To form a palindrome, the letters must be arranged such that they read the same forwards and backwards. Given the letters: f, q, y, q, y, f, we can arrange them as follows:\n\n- The first and last letters should be the same.\n- The second and second-to-last letters should be the same.\n- The third and third-to-last letters should be the same.\n\nUsing this logic, one possible palindrome is:\n\n<<<fqyyqf>>>"
