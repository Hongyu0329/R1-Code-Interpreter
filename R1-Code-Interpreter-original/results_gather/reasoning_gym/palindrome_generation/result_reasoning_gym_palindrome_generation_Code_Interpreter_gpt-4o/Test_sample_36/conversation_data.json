    "\nassistant > To form a palindrome, we need to arrange the letters such that the sequence reads the same forwards and backwards. A palindrome can have at most one character with an odd count, which would be placed in the center if the total number of characters is odd.\n\nLet's analyze the given letters:\n\n- c: 2\n- x: 2\n- p: 2\n- y: 2\n- t: 2\n\nAll characters have an even count, so we can form a palindrome by pairing them symmetrically around the center.\n\nOne possible palindrome is: \"cyxttxyc\"\n\nEnclosing it within triple angle brackets, we get:\n\n<<<cyxttxyc>>>"
