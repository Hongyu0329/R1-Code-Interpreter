    "\nassistant > To form a palindrome using the letters \"i, y, y, i\", we can arrange them as follows:\n\n- Place the letters \"i\" at the beginning and end.\n- Place the letters \"y\" in the middle.\n\nThis forms the palindrome \"iyyi\".\n\nHere is the output enclosed within triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<iyyi>>>"
