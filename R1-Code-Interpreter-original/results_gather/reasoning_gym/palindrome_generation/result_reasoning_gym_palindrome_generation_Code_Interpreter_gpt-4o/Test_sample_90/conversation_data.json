    "\nassistant > To form a palindrome, the letters must be arranged such that they read the same forwards and backwards. Given the letters: p, y, h, y, p, h, we can arrange them as follows:\n\n- The letters 'p', 'y', and 'h' can be mirrored around the center.\n\nOne possible palindrome is \"phyhyp\".\n\nThus, the palindrome is:\n\n<<<phyhyp>>>"
