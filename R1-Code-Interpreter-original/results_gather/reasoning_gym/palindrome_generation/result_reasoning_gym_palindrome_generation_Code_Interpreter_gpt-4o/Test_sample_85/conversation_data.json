You must use all the letters provided.\n\nYour output should be a single string, with no spaces or punctuation, and enclose it within triple angle brackets, like <<<single string>>>.\n\nNow, form a valid palindrome using the following letters: f, v, e, v, f, e\n",

    "\nassistant > To form a palindrome, the letters must be arranged such that they read the same forwards and backwards. Given the letters: f, v, e, v, f, e, we can arrange them as follows:\n\n- The letters 'f' and 'e' can be placed symmetrically around the center.\n- The letter 'v' can be placed in the center.\n\nA valid palindrome using these letters is \"fevvef\".\n\nThus, the palindrome is:\n\n<<<fevvef>>>"
