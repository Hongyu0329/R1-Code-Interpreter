    "\nassistant > To form a palindrome, we need to arrange the letters such that the sequence reads the same forwards and backwards. Given the letters: a, a, c, c, p, p, n, n, we can form the palindrome by arranging them symmetrically around a center.\n\nOne possible palindrome is \"acpnnpca\". Let's enclose it within triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<acpnnpca>>>"
