    "\nassistant > To form a palindrome, we need to arrange the letters such that the sequence reads the same forwards and backwards. Given the letters: z, o, o, e, z, e, n, we can form the palindrome by placing the letters symmetrically around a central point.\n\nOne possible palindrome is:\n\n<<<zeonoez>>>"
