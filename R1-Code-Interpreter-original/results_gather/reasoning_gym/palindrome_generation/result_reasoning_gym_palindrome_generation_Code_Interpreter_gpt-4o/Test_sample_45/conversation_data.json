You must use all the letters provided.\n\nYour output should be a single string, with no spaces or punctuation, and enclose it within triple angle brackets, like <<<single string>>>.\n\nNow, form a valid palindrome using the following letters: v, d, v, g, i, i, g\n",

    "\nassistant > To form a palindrome, the letters must be arranged such that they read the same forwards and backwards. Here's one way to arrange the given letters into a palindrome:\n\n- Center: \"i\" (since it appears twice, it can be placed in the center)\n- Symmetric pairs: \"v\", \"g\", \"d\", \"g\", \"v\"\n\nThus, one possible palindrome is \"vigdiv\".\n\nHere is the palindrome enclosed within triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<vigdiv>>>"
