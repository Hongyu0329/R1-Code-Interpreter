You must use all the letters provided.\n\nYour output should be a single string, with no spaces or punctuation, and enclose it within triple angle brackets, like <<<single string>>>.\n\nNow, form a valid palindrome using the following letters: e, d, j, d, e, m, m\n",

    "\nassistant > To form a palindrome, we need to arrange the letters such that they read the same forwards and backwards. A palindrome can have at most one character with an odd count, which would be placed in the center if the total number of characters is odd.\n\nGiven the letters: e, d, j, d, e, m, m\n\nLet's analyze the frequency of each letter:\n\n- e: 2\n- d: 2\n- j: 1\n- m: 2\n\nThe letter 'j' appears an odd number of times, so it can be placed in the center. The other letters can be symmetrically arranged around it.\n\nA possible palindrome is: \"edmjmdde\"\n\nThus, the palindrome formed is:\n\n<<<edmjmdde>>>"
