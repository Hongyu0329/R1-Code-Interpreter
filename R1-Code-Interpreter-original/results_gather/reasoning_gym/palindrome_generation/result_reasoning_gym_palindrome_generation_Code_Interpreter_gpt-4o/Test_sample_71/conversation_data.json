You must use all the letters provided.\n\nYour output should be a single string, with no spaces or punctuation, and enclose it within triple angle brackets, like <<<single string>>>.\n\nNow, form a valid palindrome using the following letters: s, r, v, v, x, y, r, x, s, y\n",

    "\nassistant > To form a palindrome, we need to ensure that the sequence of letters reads the same forwards and backwards. This means that each letter must have a matching pair, except for possibly one letter, which can be in the middle if the total number of letters is odd.\n\nLet's analyze the given letters: s, r, v, v, x, y, r, x, s, y.\n\n- s: 2\n- r: 2\n- v: 2\n- x: 2\n- y: 2\n\nSince all letters have even counts, we can pair them up to form a palindrome. One possible palindrome is:\n\n- Start with one 's', then one 'r', one 'v', one 'x', and one 'y'.\n- Mirror this sequence to complete the palindrome.\n\nThus, a valid palindrome is \"srvxyrxvsr\".\n\nThe palindrome is enclosed within triple angle brackets: <<<srvxyrxvsr>>>."
