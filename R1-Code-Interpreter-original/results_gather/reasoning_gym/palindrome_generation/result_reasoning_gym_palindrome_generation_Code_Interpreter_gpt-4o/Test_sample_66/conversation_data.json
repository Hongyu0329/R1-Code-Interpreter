    "\nassistant > To form a palindrome, the letters must be arranged such that they read the same forwards and backwards. Given the letters: z, k, b, o, o, b, z, k, we can arrange them as follows:\n\n- The letters 'z', 'k', 'b', and 'o' each appear twice, which allows us to place them symmetrically around the center.\n\nOne possible palindrome arrangement is: \"zkboobkz\".\n\nThus, the palindrome is:\n\n<<<zkboobkz>>>"
