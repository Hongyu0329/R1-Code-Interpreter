    "\nassistant > To form a palindrome, the letters must be arranged such that they read the same forwards and backwards. Given the letters \"o, o, g, v, g, v\", we can arrange them as follows:\n\n- The letters \"g\" and \"v\" can be placed symmetrically around the center.\n- The letters \"o\" can be placed in the center.\n\nOne possible palindrome is \"vggoovg\".\n\nThus, the palindrome is:\n\n<<<vggoovg>>>"
