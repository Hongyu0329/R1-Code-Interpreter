You must use all the letters provided.\n\nYour output should be a single string, with no spaces or punctuation, and enclose it within triple angle brackets, like <<<single string>>>.\n\nNow, form a valid palindrome using the following letters: e, x, u, x, e, h, u, f, f, h\n",

    "\nassistant > To form a palindrome, the letters must be arranged such that the sequence reads the same forwards and backwards. For the given letters, we can arrange them as follows:\n\n- The letters 'e', 'x', 'u', 'h', 'f' can be mirrored around the center.\n- The center of the palindrome can be any letter that appears an odd number of times.\n\nGiven the letters: e, x, u, x, e, h, u, f, f, h, we can form the palindrome:\n\n<<<exuhffuhxe>>>"
