    "To form a valid palindrome using the given letters, we need to consider the properties of a palindrome. A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards. This means that the sequence of letters on the left half of the palindrome must mirror the sequence on the right half.\n\nLet's analyze the given letters: h, h, l, p, l.\n\n1. **Count the occurrences of each letter:**\n   - 'h' appears 2 times.\n   - 'l' appears 2 times.\n   - 'p' appears 1 time.\n\n2. **Determine the structure of the palindrome:**\n   - For a string to be a palindrome, if it has an odd length, it can have at most one character with an odd count (which will be placed in the center), and all other characters must have even counts.\n   - If the string has an even length, all characters must have even counts.\n\n3. **Apply the structure to the given letters:**\n   - We have 5 letters, which is an odd number. Therefore, we can have one character with an odd count.\n   - 'p' appears 1 time, which is odd, so 'p' can be placed in the center of the palindrome.\n   - The remaining letters are 'h', 'h', 'l', 'l', which all have even counts.\n\n4. **Form the palindrome:**\n   - Place 'p' in the center.\n   - Arrange the remaining letters symmetrically around 'p'.\n   - One possible arrangement is to place 'h' and 'l' on either side of 'p', ensuring symmetry.\n\n5. **Construct the palindrome:**\n   - A valid palindrome using the letters is \"hlplh\".\n\nThus, the palindrome formed using the given letters is:\n\n<<<hlplh>>>"
