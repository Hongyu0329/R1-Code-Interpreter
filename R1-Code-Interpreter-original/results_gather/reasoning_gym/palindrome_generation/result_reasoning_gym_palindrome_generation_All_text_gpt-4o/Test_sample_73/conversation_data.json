    "To form a valid palindrome using the given letters, we need to ensure that the sequence reads the same forwards and backwards. Let's analyze the steps required to achieve this:\n\n1. **Count the Frequency of Each Letter**: \n   - a: 2\n   - c: 2\n   - p: 2\n   - n: 2\n\n2. **Determine the Structure of the Palindrome**:\n   - For a string to be a palindrome, each letter must appear an even number of times, except for possibly one letter which can appear an odd number of times (this would be the center of the palindrome if the length is odd).\n   - In this case, all letters appear an even number of times, which means we can form a palindrome without any letter being in the center.\n\n3. **Construct the Palindrome**:\n   - Since all letters appear twice, we can pair them symmetrically around the center.\n   - A simple approach is to arrange the letters in pairs and mirror them around the center.\n\n4. **Form the Palindrome**:\n   - One possible arrangement is to place the letters in the order: a, c, p, n, n, p, c, a.\n   - This sequence reads the same forwards and backwards.\n\n5. **Verify the Palindrome**:\n   - Forward: acpnnpca\n   - Backward: acpnnpca\n   - The sequence is the same forwards and backwards, confirming it is a palindrome.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - Enclose the palindrome in triple angle brackets as required.\n\nThe final palindrome is: <<<acpnnpca>>>"
