    "To form a valid palindrome using the given letters, we need to ensure that the sequence of letters reads the same forwards and backwards. Let's analyze the steps required to achieve this:\n\n1. **Count the Frequency of Each Letter**: \n   - 'o' appears 2 times.\n   - 's' appears 2 times.\n   - 'm' appears 2 times.\n\n2. **Determine the Structure of the Palindrome**:\n   - A palindrome can have at most one letter with an odd frequency (which would be placed in the center), while all other letters must have even frequencies to be symmetrically placed around the center.\n   - In this case, all letters have even frequencies, so we can use all of them symmetrically without needing a central letter.\n\n3. **Form the Palindrome**:\n   - Since all letters have even frequencies, we can pair them symmetrically.\n   - We can start by placing one 'o' at the beginning and one 'o' at the end.\n   - Next, place one 's' after the first 'o' and one 's' before the last 'o'.\n   - Finally, place one 'm' after the first 's' and one 'm' before the last 's'.\n\n4. **Construct the Palindrome**:\n   - Following the above structure, the palindrome can be constructed as \"osmmso\".\n\n5. **Verify the Palindrome**:\n   - Check if \"osmmso\" reads the same forwards and backwards: \n     - Forwards: \"osmmso\"\n     - Backwards: \"osmmso\"\n   - Since both are identical, \"osmmso\" is indeed a valid palindrome.\n\nTherefore, the valid palindrome formed using the given letters is:\n\n<<<osmmso>>>"
