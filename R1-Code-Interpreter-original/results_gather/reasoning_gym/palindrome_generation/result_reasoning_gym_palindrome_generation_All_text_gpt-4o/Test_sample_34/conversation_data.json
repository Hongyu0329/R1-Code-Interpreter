    "To form a valid palindrome using the given letters, we need to ensure that the sequence reads the same forwards and backwards. Let's analyze the steps:\n\n1. **Count the Frequency of Each Letter**: \n   - 'i' appears 2 times.\n   - 'y' appears 2 times.\n\n2. **Determine the Structure of the Palindrome**:\n   - A palindrome can have at most one character with an odd frequency (which would be placed in the center if the palindrome has an odd length).\n   - In this case, all characters have even frequencies, which means we can form a palindrome with an even length.\n\n3. **Construct the Palindrome**:\n   - Since both 'i' and 'y' appear twice, we can place one 'i' and one 'y' on each side of the palindrome.\n   - A possible structure is: 'i', 'y', 'y', 'i'.\n\n4. **Verify the Palindrome**:\n   - The sequence 'iyyi' reads the same forwards and backwards, confirming it is a valid palindrome.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - The palindrome is 'iyyi'.\n\nTherefore, the valid palindrome formed using the given letters is:\n\n<<<iyyi>>>"
