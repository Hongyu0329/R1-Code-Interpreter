    "To form a valid palindrome using the given letters, we need to ensure that the sequence of letters reads the same forwards and backwards. Let's analyze the steps required to achieve this:\n\n1. **Count the Frequency of Each Letter**: \n   - e: 2\n   - d: 2\n   - j: 1\n   - m: 2\n\n2. **Identify the Structure of a Palindrome**:\n   - A palindrome can have at most one letter with an odd frequency (this letter would be placed in the center if the palindrome has an odd length).\n   - All other letters must have even frequencies so they can be symmetrically placed around the center.\n\n3. **Check the Frequencies**:\n   - The letter 'j' has an odd frequency (1), which means it can be placed in the center of the palindrome.\n   - The letters 'e', 'd', and 'm' all have even frequencies, which means they can be symmetrically placed around the center.\n\n4. **Form the Palindrome**:\n   - Place 'j' in the center.\n   - Arrange the letters with even frequencies symmetrically around 'j'.\n   - For example, we can place 'e', 'd', and 'm' on one side and mirror them on the other side.\n\n5. **Construct the Palindrome**:\n   - One possible arrangement is: \"edmjmdde\"\n   - This reads the same forwards and backwards, satisfying the palindrome condition.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - Enclose the palindrome in triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final palindrome is: <<<edmjmdde>>>"
