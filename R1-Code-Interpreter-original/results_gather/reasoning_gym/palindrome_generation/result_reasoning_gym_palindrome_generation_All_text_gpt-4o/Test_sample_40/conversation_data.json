    "To form a valid palindrome using the given letters, we need to ensure that the sequence reads the same forwards and backwards. Let's analyze the steps:\n\n1. **Count the Occurrences**: \n   - We have the letters: t, u, t, u.\n   - Count of 't': 2\n   - Count of 'u': 2\n\n2. **Check for Palindrome Possibility**:\n   - A palindrome can have at most one character with an odd count (for the middle position in an odd-length palindrome).\n   - Here, both 't' and 'u' have even counts, which means we can form a palindrome without any issues.\n\n3. **Form the Palindrome**:\n   - Since both letters have even counts, we can arrange them symmetrically.\n   - One possible arrangement is to place 't' at the beginning and end, and 'u' in the middle positions.\n\n4. **Construct the Palindrome**:\n   - Arrange the letters as: \"tutu\".\n   - This sequence reads the same forwards and backwards, satisfying the palindrome condition.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Enclose the palindrome in triple angle brackets as instructed.\n\nThe final palindrome is: <<<tutu>>>"
