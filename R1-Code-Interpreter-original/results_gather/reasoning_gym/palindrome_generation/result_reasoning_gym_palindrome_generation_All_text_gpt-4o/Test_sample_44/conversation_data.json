    "To form a valid palindrome using the given letters, we need to ensure that the sequence of letters reads the same forwards and backwards. Let's analyze the steps required to achieve this:\n\n1. **Count the Frequency of Each Letter**: \n   - b: 2\n   - x: 2\n   - k: 2\n   - m: 2\n\n2. **Check for Palindrome Possibility**:\n   - A palindrome can have at most one character with an odd frequency (for the center of the palindrome), while all other characters must have even frequencies.\n   - In this case, all characters have even frequencies, which means we can form a palindrome without any issues.\n\n3. **Form the Palindrome**:\n   - Since all characters have even frequencies, we can pair them symmetrically around the center.\n   - We can start by arranging the letters in pairs: bb, xx, kk, mm.\n   - To form a palindrome, we can place these pairs symmetrically. For example, we can arrange them as: b, x, k, m, m, k, x, b.\n\n4. **Verify the Palindrome**:\n   - The sequence b, x, k, m, m, k, x, b reads the same forwards and backwards, confirming it is a valid palindrome.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - The final palindrome is: bxmmkxb\n\nTherefore, the valid palindrome formed using the given letters is:\n\n<<<bxmmkxb>>>"
