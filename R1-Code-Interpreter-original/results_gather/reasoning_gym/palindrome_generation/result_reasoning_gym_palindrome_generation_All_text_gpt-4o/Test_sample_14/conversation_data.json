    "To form a valid palindrome using the given letters, we need to ensure that the sequence reads the same forwards and backwards. Let's analyze the steps required to achieve this:\n\n1. **Count the Occurrences**: \n   - We have the letters: p, p, k, k.\n   - Count of 'p': 2\n   - Count of 'k': 2\n\n2. **Determine the Structure of the Palindrome**:\n   - A palindrome can have at most one character with an odd count (which would be placed in the center if the palindrome has an odd length). However, in this case, all characters have even counts, which simplifies the process.\n   - For a palindrome with even counts of all characters, we can pair the characters symmetrically around the center.\n\n3. **Form the Palindrome**:\n   - Since both 'p' and 'k' have even counts, we can place one 'p' and one 'k' on one side and mirror them on the other side.\n   - One possible arrangement is: pk on one side and kp on the other side, forming the palindrome \"pkkp\".\n\n4. **Verify the Palindrome**:\n   - Check if \"pkkp\" reads the same forwards and backwards:\n     - Forwards: pkkp\n     - Backwards: pkkp\n   - Since both are identical, \"pkkp\" is indeed a palindrome.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - Enclose the palindrome in triple angle brackets as instructed.\n\nThe final palindrome formed using the letters p, p, k, k is:\n\n<<<pkkp>>>"
