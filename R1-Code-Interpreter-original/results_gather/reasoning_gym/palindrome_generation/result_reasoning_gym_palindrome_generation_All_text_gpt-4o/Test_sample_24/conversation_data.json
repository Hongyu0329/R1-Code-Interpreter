    "To form a valid palindrome using the given letters, we need to ensure that the sequence of letters reads the same forwards and backwards. Let's analyze the steps required to achieve this:\n\n1. **Identify the Letters**: We have the letters q, m, and m.\n\n2. **Count the Occurrences**: \n   - q appears 1 time.\n   - m appears 2 times.\n\n3. **Understand Palindrome Requirements**:\n   - For a string to be a palindrome, the letters must be arranged such that the sequence is symmetric around its center.\n   - If the length of the string is odd, there can be only one letter with an odd count, which will be placed in the center. All other letters must have even counts to be symmetrically placed around the center.\n\n4. **Arrange the Letters**:\n   - Since we have an odd number of letters (3), we can place the letter with an odd count (q) in the center.\n   - The letter m, which appears twice, can be placed symmetrically around the center.\n\n5. **Form the Palindrome**:\n   - Place one 'm' on each side of 'q' to form the palindrome: \"mqm\".\n\n6. **Verify the Palindrome**:\n   - \"mqm\" reads the same forwards and backwards, confirming it is a valid palindrome.\n\n7. **Output the Result**:\n   - Enclose the palindrome in triple angle brackets as required.\n\nThe final palindrome is: <<<mqm>>>"
