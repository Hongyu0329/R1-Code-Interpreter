    "To form a valid palindrome using the given letters, we need to ensure that the sequence reads the same forwards and backwards. Let's analyze the steps required to achieve this:\n\n1. **Count the Frequency of Each Letter**: \n   - l: 2\n   - z: 2\n   - x: 2\n\n2. **Understand Palindrome Structure**:\n   - A palindrome can have at most one character with an odd frequency (which would be placed in the center if the palindrome has an odd length).\n   - In this case, all characters have even frequencies, which means we can form a palindrome without any character in the center.\n\n3. **Form the Palindrome**:\n   - Since all characters have even frequencies, we can pair them symmetrically around the center.\n   - We can start by placing one of each character on one side and mirror it on the other side.\n\n4. **Construct the Palindrome**:\n   - Choose one possible arrangement: \"lzx\" on one side.\n   - Mirror it to form the other side: \"xzl\".\n   - Combine them to form the palindrome: \"lzx\" + \"xzl\" = \"lzxxzl\".\n\n5. **Verify the Palindrome**:\n   - Check if \"lzxxzl\" reads the same forwards and backwards: \n     - Forwards: lzxxzl\n     - Backwards: lzxxzl\n   - It matches, confirming it is a valid palindrome.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - Enclose the palindrome in triple angle brackets as instructed.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<lzxxzl>>>"
