    "To form a valid palindrome using the given letters, we need to ensure that the sequence reads the same forwards and backwards. Let's analyze the steps to achieve this:\n\n1. **Identify the Letters**: We have the letters w, x, and w.\n\n2. **Count the Occurrences**: \n   - 'w' appears twice.\n   - 'x' appears once.\n\n3. **Determine the Structure of a Palindrome**:\n   - A palindrome can have at most one character with an odd count (this character will be in the middle if the palindrome has an odd length).\n   - All other characters must have even counts to be symmetrically placed around the center.\n\n4. **Arrange the Letters**:\n   - Since 'w' appears twice, it can be placed symmetrically at the beginning and end of the palindrome.\n   - 'x', which appears once, can be placed in the middle.\n\n5. **Form the Palindrome**:\n   - Place 'w' at the start and end: w _ w\n   - Place 'x' in the middle: wxw\n\n6. **Verify the Palindrome**:\n   - Read forwards: wxw\n   - Read backwards: wxw\n   - Both readings are identical, confirming it is a palindrome.\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully formed a valid palindrome using all the given letters.\n\nThe final palindrome is: <<<wxw>>>"
