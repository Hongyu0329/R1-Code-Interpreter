    "To form a valid palindrome using the given letters, we need to ensure that the sequence reads the same forwards and backwards. Let's analyze the steps required to achieve this:\n\n1. **Count the Frequency of Each Letter**: \n   - z: 2\n   - u: 2\n   - j: 1\n\n2. **Determine the Structure of the Palindrome**:\n   - A palindrome can have at most one character with an odd frequency (which would be placed in the center), while all other characters must have even frequencies to be symmetrically placed around the center.\n\n3. **Identify the Center Character**:\n   - In this case, the letter 'j' appears once, which is an odd frequency. Therefore, 'j' will be placed in the center of the palindrome.\n\n4. **Arrange the Remaining Characters**:\n   - The letters 'z' and 'u' both have even frequencies (2 each), so they can be symmetrically placed around the center.\n   - We can arrange them as follows: \"z\" and \"u\" on one side, and \"z\" and \"u\" on the other side, with \"j\" in the center.\n\n5. **Construct the Palindrome**:\n   - One possible arrangement is: \"z\", \"u\", \"j\", \"u\", \"z\".\n\n6. **Verify the Palindrome**:\n   - Read forwards: \"zujuz\"\n   - Read backwards: \"zujuz\"\n   - Both are the same, confirming it is a valid palindrome.\n\nTherefore, the valid palindrome formed using the given letters is:\n\n<<<zujuz>>>"
