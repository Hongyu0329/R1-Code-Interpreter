    "To form a valid palindrome using the given letters, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of a Palindrome**: A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same forwards and backwards. This means that the sequence must be symmetrical around its center.\n\n2. **Count the Occurrences of Each Letter**: \n   - We have the letters: x, x, s.\n   - Count of 'x': 2\n   - Count of 's': 1\n\n3. **Determine the Structure of the Palindrome**:\n   - For a sequence to be a palindrome, each letter that appears an even number of times can be symmetrically placed around the center.\n   - If a letter appears an odd number of times, it can only appear in the center of the palindrome.\n\n4. **Form the Palindrome**:\n   - Since 'x' appears twice (an even number), it can be placed symmetrically on either side of the center.\n   - 's' appears once (an odd number), so it should be placed in the center.\n\n5. **Construct the Palindrome**:\n   - Place 's' in the center.\n   - Place one 'x' on each side of 's'.\n\n6. **Verify the Palindrome**:\n   - The sequence \"xsx\" reads the same forwards and backwards, confirming it is a palindrome.\n\n7. **Output the Result**:\n   - The palindrome formed is \"xsx\".\n\nTherefore, the valid palindrome using the given letters is:\n\n<<<xsx>>>"
