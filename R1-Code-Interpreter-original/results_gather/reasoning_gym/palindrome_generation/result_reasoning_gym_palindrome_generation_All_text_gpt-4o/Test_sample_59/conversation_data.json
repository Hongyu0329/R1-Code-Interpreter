    "To form a valid palindrome using the given letters, we need to ensure that the sequence reads the same forwards and backwards. Let's analyze the steps to achieve this:\n\n1. **Count the Occurrences**: \n   - We have the letters: z, p, z, p.\n   - Count of 'z': 2\n   - Count of 'p': 2\n\n2. **Check for Palindrome Possibility**:\n   - A palindrome can have at most one character with an odd count (which would be placed in the center if the length of the sequence is odd).\n   - In this case, both 'z' and 'p' have even counts, which means we can form a palindrome without any issues.\n\n3. **Form the Palindrome**:\n   - Since both letters have even counts, we can arrange them symmetrically.\n   - One possible arrangement is to place one 'z' at the start and one at the end, and similarly for 'p'.\n   - This gives us the sequence: z, p, p, z.\n\n4. **Verify the Palindrome**:\n   - Read forwards: z, p, p, z\n   - Read backwards: z, p, p, z\n   - Both readings are identical, confirming it is a palindrome.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - The palindrome formed is \"zppz\".\n\nTherefore, the valid palindrome using the given letters is:\n\n<<<zppz>>>"
