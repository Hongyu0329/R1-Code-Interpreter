    "To form a valid palindrome using the given letters, we need to consider the properties of a palindrome. A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards. This means that the sequence of letters on the left half of the palindrome must mirror the sequence on the right half.\n\nLet's analyze the given letters: y, y, z, a, a.\n\n1. **Count the occurrences of each letter:**\n   - 'y' appears 2 times.\n   - 'z' appears 1 time.\n   - 'a' appears 2 times.\n\n2. **Determine the structure of the palindrome:**\n   - For a string to be a palindrome, if it has an odd length, it can have at most one character with an odd count (which will be the middle character). If it has an even length, all characters must have even counts.\n   - In this case, we have 5 letters, which is an odd number, so we can have one character with an odd count.\n\n3. **Identify the middle character:**\n   - 'z' appears 1 time, which is an odd count. Therefore, 'z' can be the middle character of the palindrome.\n\n4. **Form the palindrome:**\n   - The remaining letters are 'y', 'y', 'a', 'a'. These can be arranged symmetrically around 'z'.\n   - One possible arrangement is to place 'a' and 'y' on either side of 'z', ensuring symmetry.\n\n5. **Construct the palindrome:**\n   - Arrange the letters as follows: 'a', 'y', 'z', 'y', 'a'.\n   - This arrangement reads the same forwards and backwards, satisfying the condition of a palindrome.\n\nTherefore, the valid palindrome formed from the given letters is:\n\n<<<ayzya>>>"
