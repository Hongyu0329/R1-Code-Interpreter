    "To form a valid palindrome using the given letters, we need to ensure that the sequence reads the same forwards and backwards. Let's analyze the steps required to achieve this:\n\n1. **Count the Frequency of Each Letter**: \n   - x: 2\n   - b: 2\n   - a: 2\n   - u: 2\n\n2. **Understand Palindrome Structure**:\n   - A palindrome can have at most one character with an odd frequency (which would be placed in the center if the palindrome has an odd length).\n   - In this case, all characters have even frequencies, which means we can form a palindrome without any character in the center.\n\n3. **Form the Palindrome**:\n   - Since all characters have even frequencies, we can pair them symmetrically around the center.\n   - We can start by placing one of each pair on one side and the other on the opposite side.\n\n4. **Construct the Palindrome**:\n   - Choose a sequence for half of the palindrome, and mirror it for the other half.\n   - For example, we can start with \"x\", followed by \"b\", then \"a\", and finally \"u\".\n   - The sequence \"x, b, a, u\" can be mirrored to form the palindrome \"x, b, a, u, u, a, b, x\".\n\n5. **Verify the Palindrome**:\n   - The sequence \"x, b, a, u, u, a, b, x\" reads the same forwards and backwards, confirming it is a valid palindrome.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - Combine the letters into a single string without spaces or punctuation.\n\nThe final palindrome is: <<<xbauuabx>>>"
