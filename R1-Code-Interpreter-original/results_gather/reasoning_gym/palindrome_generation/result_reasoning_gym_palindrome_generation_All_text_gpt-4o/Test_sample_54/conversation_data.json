    "To form a valid palindrome using the given letters, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Requirements of a Palindrome**: A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same forwards and backwards. This means that the sequence must be symmetrical around its center.\n\n2. **Analyze the Given Letters**: We have the letters: o, o, k. \n\n3. **Count the Occurrences of Each Letter**: \n   - 'o' appears 2 times.\n   - 'k' appears 1 time.\n\n4. **Determine the Structure of the Palindrome**:\n   - For a sequence to be a palindrome, if the length of the sequence is odd, there can be at most one letter with an odd count, which will be placed in the center.\n   - If the length is even, all letters must have even counts.\n\n5. **Form the Palindrome**:\n   - Since we have an odd number of letters (3), we can place the letter with an odd count ('k') in the center.\n   - The remaining letters ('o' and 'o') can be placed symmetrically around the center.\n\n6. **Construct the Palindrome**:\n   - Place 'k' in the center.\n   - Place one 'o' on each side of 'k'.\n\n7. **Verify the Palindrome**:\n   - The sequence \"o\", \"k\", \"o\" reads the same forwards and backwards, confirming it is a palindrome.\n\n8. **Output the Result**:\n   - The palindrome formed is \"oko\".\n\nTherefore, the valid palindrome using the given letters is:\n\n<<<oko>>>"
