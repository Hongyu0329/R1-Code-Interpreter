    "To form a valid palindrome using the given letters, we need to ensure that the sequence reads the same forwards and backwards. Let's analyze the steps required to achieve this:\n\n1. **Count the Frequency of Each Letter**: \n   - We have the letters: y, i, i, y.\n   - Count of 'y': 2\n   - Count of 'i': 2\n\n2. **Determine the Structure of the Palindrome**:\n   - A palindrome can have at most one character with an odd frequency in the middle if the total number of characters is odd. However, since we have an even number of letters (4), all characters must have even frequencies to form a palindrome.\n   - In this case, both 'y' and 'i' have even frequencies, which is suitable for forming a palindrome.\n\n3. **Construct the Palindrome**:\n   - Since both 'y' and 'i' have even counts, we can arrange them symmetrically.\n   - One possible arrangement is to place one 'y' at the start and one at the end, and similarly, place one 'i' after the first 'y' and one before the last 'y'.\n\n4. **Verify the Palindrome**:\n   - The sequence \"yiiy\" reads the same forwards and backwards, confirming it is a valid palindrome.\n\n5. **Output the Result**:\n   - The palindrome formed is \"yiiy\".\n\nTherefore, the valid palindrome using the given letters is:\n\n<<<yiiy>>>"
