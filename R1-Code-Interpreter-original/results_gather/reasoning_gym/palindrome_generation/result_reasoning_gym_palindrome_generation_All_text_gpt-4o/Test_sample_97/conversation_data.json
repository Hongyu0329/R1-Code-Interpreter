    "To form a valid palindrome using the given letters, we need to ensure that the sequence of letters reads the same forwards and backwards. Let's analyze the steps required to achieve this:\n\n1. **Count the Frequency of Each Letter**: \n   - x: 2\n   - s: 2\n   - b: 2\n   - m: 1\n\n2. **Identify the Structure of a Palindrome**:\n   - A palindrome can have at most one character with an odd frequency (which will be placed in the center if the palindrome has an odd length).\n   - All other characters must have even frequencies so they can be symmetrically placed around the center.\n\n3. **Determine the Center Character**:\n   - The letter 'm' appears once, which is an odd frequency. Therefore, 'm' will be placed in the center of the palindrome.\n\n4. **Pair the Remaining Characters**:\n   - The letters 'x', 's', and 'b' each appear twice, which are even frequencies. These can be symmetrically placed around the center.\n\n5. **Construct the Palindrome**:\n   - Start by placing one of each of the even-frequency letters on one side of the center.\n   - Mirror these letters on the other side of the center.\n   - For example, place 'x', 's', and 'b' on one side, and mirror them on the other side with 'm' in the center.\n\n6. **Form the Palindrome**:\n   - One possible arrangement is: 'x', 's', 'b', 'm', 'b', 's', 'x'.\n\n7. **Verify the Palindrome**:\n   - The sequence 'xsbmbsx' reads the same forwards and backwards, confirming it is a valid palindrome.\n\nTherefore, the valid palindrome formed using the given letters is:\n\n<<<xsbmbsx>>>"
