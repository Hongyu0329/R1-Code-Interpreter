    "To form a valid palindrome using the given letters, we need to ensure that the sequence reads the same forwards and backwards. Let's analyze the steps:\n\n1. **Count the Occurrences**: \n   - We have the letters: r, z, r.\n   - Count of 'r': 2\n   - Count of 'z': 1\n\n2. **Palindrome Structure**:\n   - A palindrome can have at most one character with an odd count (which would be placed in the center if the palindrome has an odd length).\n   - All other characters must have even counts to be symmetrically placed around the center.\n\n3. **Forming the Palindrome**:\n   - Since 'r' appears twice, it can be placed symmetrically at the beginning and end of the palindrome.\n   - 'z' appears once, which is an odd count, so it can be placed in the center.\n\n4. **Construct the Palindrome**:\n   - Place 'r' at the start and end: r _ r\n   - Place 'z' in the center: r z r\n\n5. **Verify**:\n   - The sequence \"rzr\" reads the same forwards and backwards, confirming it is a palindrome.\n\nThus, the valid palindrome formed using the letters r, z, r is:\n\n<<<rzr>>>"
