    "To form a valid palindrome using the given letters, we need to ensure that the sequence reads the same forwards and backwards. Here are the steps to achieve this:\n\n1. **Count the Frequency of Each Letter**: \n   - h: 2\n   - k: 2\n   - m: 2\n   - v: 2\n   - p: 2\n\n2. **Check for Palindrome Possibility**:\n   - A palindrome can have at most one character with an odd frequency (which would be placed in the center if the palindrome has an odd length). However, since all characters have even frequencies, we can form a palindrome without any issues.\n\n3. **Construct the Palindrome**:\n   - Since all characters have even frequencies, we can pair them symmetrically around the center.\n   - We can start by arranging half of each pair on one side and mirror it on the other side.\n\n4. **Form the Palindrome**:\n   - Choose an arrangement for half of the palindrome. For example, we can start with \"hkmvp\".\n   - Mirror this sequence to form the complete palindrome: \"hkmvp\" + \"pvmkh\".\n\n5. **Verify the Palindrome**:\n   - Check that the sequence reads the same forwards and backwards: \"hkmvppvmkh\".\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - Enclose the palindrome in triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final palindrome is: <<<hkmvppvmkh>>>"
