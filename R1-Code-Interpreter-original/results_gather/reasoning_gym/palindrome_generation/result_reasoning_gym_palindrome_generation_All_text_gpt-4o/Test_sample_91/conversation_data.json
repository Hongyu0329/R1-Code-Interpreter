    "To form a valid palindrome using the given letters, we need to ensure that the sequence of letters reads the same forwards and backwards. Let's analyze the steps required to achieve this:\n\n1. **Identify the Letters**: We have the letters y, g, and g.\n\n2. **Count the Occurrences**: \n   - y: 1 occurrence\n   - g: 2 occurrences\n\n3. **Understand Palindrome Requirements**:\n   - For a string to be a palindrome, it can have at most one character with an odd count (this would be the middle character in an odd-length palindrome).\n   - All other characters must have even counts to ensure they can be symmetrically placed around the center.\n\n4. **Plan the Palindrome**:\n   - Since 'g' appears twice, it can be placed symmetrically on either side of the palindrome.\n   - 'y' appears once, so it can be placed in the middle.\n\n5. **Construct the Palindrome**:\n   - Place 'g' on both ends and 'y' in the middle to form the palindrome \"gyg\".\n\n6. **Verify the Palindrome**:\n   - Read forwards: \"gyg\"\n   - Read backwards: \"gyg\"\n   - Both are the same, confirming it is a valid palindrome.\n\n7. **Format the Output**:\n   - Enclose the palindrome in triple angle brackets as required.\n\nThe final palindrome is:\n\n<<<gyg>>>"
