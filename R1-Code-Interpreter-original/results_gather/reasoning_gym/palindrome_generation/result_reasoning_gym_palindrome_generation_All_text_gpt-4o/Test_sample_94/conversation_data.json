    "To form a valid palindrome using the given letters, we need to ensure that the sequence of letters reads the same forwards and backwards. Let's analyze the steps required to achieve this:\n\n1. **Identify the Letters**: We have the letters p, p, and o.\n\n2. **Understand Palindrome Structure**:\n   - A palindrome can have an even or odd number of characters.\n   - If the number of characters is odd, there can be one character in the middle that does not need to be paired.\n   - The characters on either side of the middle character must be mirror images of each other.\n\n3. **Count the Occurrences**:\n   - We have two 'p's and one 'o'.\n\n4. **Determine the Middle Character**:\n   - Since we have an odd number of total letters (3), one character can be in the middle without a pair.\n   - The character 'o' can be placed in the middle because it appears only once.\n\n5. **Pair the Remaining Characters**:\n   - The two 'p's can be placed on either side of the 'o' to maintain symmetry.\n\n6. **Form the Palindrome**:\n   - Arrange the letters as 'p', 'o', 'p' to form the palindrome \"pop\".\n\n7. **Verify the Palindrome**:\n   - Read forwards: \"pop\".\n   - Read backwards: \"pop\".\n   - Both readings are identical, confirming it is a palindrome.\n\n8. **Output the Result**:\n   - Enclose the palindrome within triple angle brackets as instructed.\n\nThe final palindrome is:\n\n<<<pop>>>"
