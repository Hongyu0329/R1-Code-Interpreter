    "To form a valid palindrome using the given letters, we need to ensure that the sequence reads the same forwards and backwards. Let's analyze the steps required to achieve this:\n\n1. **Count the Frequency of Each Letter**: \n   - n: 2\n   - k: 2\n   - a: 2\n   - j: 2\n\n2. **Check for Palindrome Possibility**:\n   - A palindrome can have at most one character with an odd frequency (for the center of the palindrome), while all other characters must have even frequencies.\n   - In this case, all characters have even frequencies, which means we can form a palindrome without any issues.\n\n3. **Construct the Palindrome**:\n   - Since all characters have even frequencies, we can pair them symmetrically around the center.\n   - We can start by placing one of each pair on one side and the other on the opposite side.\n   - For example, we can arrange the letters as follows: \"n\", \"k\", \"a\", \"j\" on one side and mirror them on the other side.\n\n4. **Form the Palindrome**:\n   - One possible palindrome arrangement is: \"n\", \"k\", \"a\", \"j\", \"j\", \"a\", \"k\", \"n\".\n\n5. **Combine the Letters**:\n   - Combine the letters into a single string: \"nkajjakn\".\n\n6. **Enclose the Result**:\n   - Enclose the palindrome within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final palindrome is: <<<nkajjakn>>>."
