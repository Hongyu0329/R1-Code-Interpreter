    "To form a valid palindrome using the given letters, we need to ensure that the sequence reads the same forwards and backwards. Let's analyze the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Letters**: We have the letters 'h', 'y', and 'h'.\n\n2. **Count the Occurrences**: \n   - 'h' appears twice.\n   - 'y' appears once.\n\n3. **Palindrome Structure**:\n   - A palindrome can have at most one character with an odd count (which would be placed in the center if the palindrome has an odd length).\n   - All other characters must have even counts to be symmetrically placed around the center.\n\n4. **Arrange the Letters**:\n   - Since 'h' appears twice, it can be placed symmetrically at the beginning and end of the palindrome.\n   - 'y', which appears once, can be placed in the center.\n\n5. **Form the Palindrome**:\n   - Place 'h' at the start and end: h _ h\n   - Place 'y' in the center: hyh\n\n6. **Verify**:\n   - The sequence 'hyh' reads the same forwards and backwards, confirming it is a palindrome.\n\nBy following these steps, we have successfully formed a valid palindrome using all the given letters.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<hyh>>>"
