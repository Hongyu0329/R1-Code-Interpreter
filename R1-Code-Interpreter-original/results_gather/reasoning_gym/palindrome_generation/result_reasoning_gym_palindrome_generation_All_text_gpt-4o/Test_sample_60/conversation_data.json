    "To form a valid palindrome using the given letters, we need to ensure that the sequence of letters reads the same forwards and backwards. Here are the steps to achieve this:\n\n1. **Count the Frequency of Each Letter**: \n   - o: 2\n   - n: 2\n   - z: 1\n   - u: 2\n   - g: 2\n\n2. **Identify the Structure of a Palindrome**:\n   - A palindrome can have at most one character with an odd frequency (which will be placed in the center if the palindrome has an odd length).\n   - All other characters must have even frequencies so they can be symmetrically placed around the center.\n\n3. **Check the Frequencies**:\n   - The letter 'z' has an odd frequency (1), which means it can be placed in the center of the palindrome.\n   - All other letters have even frequencies, which is suitable for forming a palindrome.\n\n4. **Form the Palindrome**:\n   - Place the letter with the odd frequency ('z') in the center.\n   - Distribute the letters with even frequencies symmetrically around the center.\n   - For example, we can arrange the letters as follows: \"o\", \"n\", \"u\", \"g\" on one side and mirror them on the other side.\n\n5. **Construct the Palindrome**:\n   - One possible arrangement is: \"onugzguon\"\n   - This reads the same forwards and backwards, satisfying the palindrome condition.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - Enclose the palindrome within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final palindrome is: <<<onugzguon>>>"
