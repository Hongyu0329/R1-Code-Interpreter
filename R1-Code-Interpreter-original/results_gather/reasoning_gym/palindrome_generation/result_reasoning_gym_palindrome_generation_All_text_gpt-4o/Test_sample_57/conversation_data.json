    "To form a valid palindrome using the given letters, we need to ensure that the sequence reads the same forwards and backwards. Let's analyze the steps required to achieve this:\n\n1. **Count the Occurrences**: \n   - We have the letters: s, t, s, t.\n   - Count the occurrences of each letter:\n     - 's' appears 2 times.\n     - 't' appears 2 times.\n\n2. **Check for Palindrome Possibility**:\n   - A palindrome can have at most one character with an odd count (which would be placed in the center if the length of the sequence is odd).\n   - In this case, both 's' and 't' have even counts, which means we can form a palindrome without any issues.\n\n3. **Form the Palindrome**:\n   - Since both letters have even counts, we can arrange them symmetrically.\n   - One possible arrangement is to place the letters in the order: s, t, t, s.\n   - This sequence reads the same forwards and backwards, satisfying the palindrome condition.\n\n4. **Output the Result**:\n   - The palindrome formed is \"stts\".\n\nTherefore, the valid palindrome using the given letters is:\n\n<<<stts>>>"
