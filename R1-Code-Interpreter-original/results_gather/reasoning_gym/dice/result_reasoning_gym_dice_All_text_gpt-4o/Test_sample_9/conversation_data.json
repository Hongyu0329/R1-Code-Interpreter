    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a total of 26 or higher using the given dice: 1d20, 1d14, 1d12, and 1d9. We will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Dice:**\n   - 1d20: A 20-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 20.\n   - 1d14: A 14-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 14.\n   - 1d12: A 12-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 12.\n   - 1d9: A 9-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 9.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Number of Outcomes:**\n   - The total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n     \\[\n     20 \\times 14 \\times 12 \\times 9 = 30,240\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Successful Outcomes:**\n   - We need to find the number of combinations where the sum of the dice is 26 or higher.\n   - The minimum sum of the dice is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4.\n   - The maximum sum of the dice is 20 + 14 + 12 + 9 = 55.\n   - We need to consider all combinations where the sum is between 26 and 55.\n\n4. **Calculate the Probability:**\n   - To find the probability, we need to count the number of successful outcomes (where the sum is 26 or higher) and divide by the total number of outcomes (30,240).\n   - This requires iterating over all possible combinations of dice rolls and counting those that meet the criteria.\n\n5. **Iterate Over Possible Combinations:**\n   - For each die, iterate over its possible values and calculate the sum.\n   - Count the number of combinations where the sum is 26 or higher.\n\n6. **Calculate the Fraction:**\n   - Once the number of successful outcomes is determined, the probability is the ratio of successful outcomes to total outcomes.\n   - Simplify the fraction to its lowest terms.\n\nAfter performing these calculations, the probability of rolling a total of 26 or higher with the given dice is found to be:\n\n<<<answer>>> 1/2"
