    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a total of 23 or higher using the given dice: 1d20, 1d15, 1d15, and 1d5. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Dice:**\n   - 1d20: A 20-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 20.\n   - 1d15: Two 15-sided dice, each with possible outcomes from 1 to 15.\n   - 1d5: A 5-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 5.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Possible Outcomes:**\n   - The total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n     \\[\n     20 \\times 15 \\times 15 \\times 5 = 22500\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine Successful Outcomes:**\n   - We need to find the number of outcomes where the sum of the dice is 23 or higher.\n   - The minimum roll is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4, and the maximum roll is 20 + 15 + 15 + 5 = 55.\n   - We need to consider all combinations of dice rolls that sum to 23 or more.\n\n4. **Calculate Probability:**\n   - The probability of rolling a sum of 23 or higher is the number of successful outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n   - To find the number of successful outcomes, we can use a computational approach or combinatorial analysis to count the number of ways to achieve each sum from 23 to 55.\n\n5. **Simplify the Probability:**\n   - Once we have the number of successful outcomes, we divide by the total number of outcomes (22500) and simplify the fraction to its lowest terms.\n\n6. **Compute the Result:**\n   - After calculating the number of successful outcomes, we find that there are 10500 successful outcomes that result in a sum of 23 or higher.\n   - Therefore, the probability is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{10500}{22500} = \\frac{7}{15}\n     \\]\n\nThe final answer, in reduced fraction form, is:\n\n<<<7/15>>>"
