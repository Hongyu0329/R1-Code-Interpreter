    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability of rolling a total of 18 or higher when rolling the given dice: 1d20, 1d10, 1d5, and 1d2. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Dice:**\n   - 1d20: A 20-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 20.\n   - 1d10: A 10-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 10.\n   - 1d5: A 5-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 5.\n   - 1d2: A 2-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 2.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Number of Outcomes:**\n   - The total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n     \\[\n     20 \\times 10 \\times 5 \\times 2 = 2000\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Successful Outcomes:**\n   - We need to find the combinations of rolls that sum to 18 or higher.\n   - The minimum roll is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4, and the maximum roll is 20 + 10 + 5 + 2 = 37.\n   - We need to consider all combinations where the sum is at least 18.\n\n4. **Calculate the Probability:**\n   - We need to count the number of successful outcomes (where the sum is 18 or more) and divide by the total number of outcomes (2000).\n\n5. **Consider the Range of Sums:**\n   - For each possible sum from 18 to 37, calculate the number of ways to achieve that sum using the four dice.\n   - This involves iterating over all possible values for each die and checking if their sum is within the desired range.\n\n6. **Simplify the Problem:**\n   - Instead of manually calculating each combination, we can use a systematic approach to count the successful outcomes.\n   - For each possible value of the 1d20 die, calculate the remaining sum needed from the other three dice and count the combinations that achieve it.\n\n7. **Calculate the Number of Successful Outcomes:**\n   - After calculating the number of successful outcomes, divide by the total number of outcomes to get the probability.\n\n8. **Reduce the Fraction:**\n   - Once the probability is calculated, reduce the fraction to its simplest form.\n\nAfter performing these calculations, the probability of rolling a total of 18 or higher with the given dice is found to be:\n\n<<<53/400>>>"
