    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a total of 28 or higher using the given dice: 1d20, 1d13, 1d7, and 1d4. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Dice:**\n   - 1d20: A 20-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 20.\n   - 1d13: A 13-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 13.\n   - 1d7: A 7-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 7.\n   - 1d4: A 4-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 4.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Number of Outcomes:**\n   - The total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n     \\[\n     20 \\times 13 \\times 7 \\times 4 = 7280\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Successful Outcomes:**\n   - We need to find the number of combinations where the sum of the dice is 28 or higher.\n   - The maximum possible sum is \\(20 + 13 + 7 + 4 = 44\\).\n   - We need to consider all combinations of rolls that result in sums from 28 to 44.\n\n4. **Calculate the Probability:**\n   - For each possible sum from 28 to 44, calculate the number of ways to achieve that sum using the four dice.\n   - This involves iterating over all possible values for each die and checking if their sum is within the desired range.\n   - Count the number of successful outcomes.\n\n5. **Compute the Probability:**\n   - The probability of rolling a sum of 28 or higher is the number of successful outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes (7280).\n\n6. **Simplify the Probability:**\n   - Once the number of successful outcomes is determined, simplify the fraction to its lowest terms.\n\nAfter performing these calculations, the probability of rolling a sum of 28 or higher with the given dice is found to be:\n\n<<<answer>>> 1/35"
