    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a total of 27 or higher with the given dice: 1d20, 1d18, 1d13, and 1d2. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Dice:**\n   - 1d20: A 20-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 20.\n   - 1d18: An 18-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 18.\n   - 1d13: A 13-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 13.\n   - 1d2: A 2-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 2.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Number of Outcomes:**\n   - The total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n     \\[\n     20 \\times 18 \\times 13 \\times 2 = 9360\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Successful Outcomes:**\n   - We need to find the combinations of rolls that sum to 27 or higher.\n   - The minimum roll is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4, and the maximum roll is 20 + 18 + 13 + 2 = 53.\n   - We need to consider all combinations where the sum is at least 27.\n\n4. **Calculate the Probability:**\n   - We need to count the number of successful outcomes (where the sum is 27 or more) and divide by the total number of outcomes (9360).\n\n5. **Consider the Range of Sums:**\n   - The range of sums that meet the criteria is from 27 to 53.\n   - For each possible sum, calculate the number of ways to achieve that sum using the four dice.\n\n6. **Use a Systematic Approach:**\n   - For each possible sum from 27 to 53, use a systematic approach (such as generating functions or dynamic programming) to count the number of ways to achieve that sum with the given dice.\n\n7. **Calculate the Number of Successful Outcomes:**\n   - After determining the number of ways to achieve each sum from 27 to 53, sum these counts to get the total number of successful outcomes.\n\n8. **Compute the Probability:**\n   - Divide the total number of successful outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes (9360) to get the probability.\n\n9. **Reduce the Fraction:**\n   - Simplify the fraction to its lowest terms to get the final answer.\n\nAfter performing these calculations, the probability of rolling a total of 27 or higher with the given dice is:\n\n<<<answer>>> 1/2"
