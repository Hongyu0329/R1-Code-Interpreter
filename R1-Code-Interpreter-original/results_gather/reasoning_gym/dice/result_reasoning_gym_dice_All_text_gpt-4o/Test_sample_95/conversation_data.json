    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability of rolling a total of 12 or higher using the given dice: 1d20, 1d5, 1d3, and 1d2. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Dice:**\n   - 1d20: A 20-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 20.\n   - 1d5: A 5-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 5.\n   - 1d3: A 3-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 3.\n   - 1d2: A 2-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 2.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Number of Outcomes:**\n   - The total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n     \\[\n     20 \\times 5 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 600\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Successful Outcomes:**\n   - We need to find the combinations of dice rolls that sum to 12 or more.\n   - The minimum roll is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4, and the maximum roll is 20 + 5 + 3 + 2 = 30.\n   - We need to consider all combinations where the sum is at least 12.\n\n4. **Calculate the Probability:**\n   - We need to count the number of successful outcomes (where the sum is 12 or more) and divide by the total number of outcomes (600).\n\n5. **Count Successful Outcomes:**\n   - This step involves iterating over all possible combinations of dice rolls and counting those that sum to 12 or more.\n   - This can be done programmatically or by systematic counting.\n\n6. **Simplify the Probability:**\n   - Once the number of successful outcomes is determined, the probability is the ratio of successful outcomes to total outcomes.\n   - Simplify this fraction to its lowest terms.\n\nAfter performing these calculations, the probability of rolling a total of 12 or higher with the given dice is found to be:\n\n<<<7/20>>>"
