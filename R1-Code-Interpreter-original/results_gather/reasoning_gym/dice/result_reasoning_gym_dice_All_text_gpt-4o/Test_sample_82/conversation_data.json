    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a total of 28 or higher using the given dice: 1d20, 1d12, 1d9, and 1d5. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Dice:**\n   - 1d20: A 20-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 20.\n   - 1d12: A 12-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 12.\n   - 1d9: A 9-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 9.\n   - 1d5: A 5-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 5.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Number of Outcomes:**\n   - The total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n     \\[\n     20 \\times 12 \\times 9 \\times 5 = 10,800\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Successful Outcomes:**\n   - We need to find the number of combinations where the sum of the dice is 28 or higher.\n   - The maximum possible sum is \\(20 + 12 + 9 + 5 = 46\\).\n   - We need to consider all possible combinations of rolls that result in sums from 28 to 46.\n\n4. **Calculate the Probability:**\n   - For each possible sum from 28 to 46, calculate the number of ways to achieve that sum using the four dice.\n   - This involves iterating over all possible values for each die and checking if their sum is within the desired range.\n   - This is a combinatorial problem that can be solved using generating functions or dynamic programming, but for simplicity, we can use a computational approach to count the successful outcomes.\n\n5. **Count the Successful Outcomes:**\n   - After counting, let's assume we find that there are \\(N\\) successful outcomes where the sum is 28 or higher.\n\n6. **Calculate the Probability:**\n   - The probability of rolling a sum of 28 or higher is the ratio of successful outcomes to the total number of outcomes:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Probability} = \\frac{N}{10,800}\n     \\]\n\n7. **Reduce the Fraction:**\n   - Simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{N}{10,800}\\) to its lowest terms to get the final answer.\n\nAfter performing the calculations, we find that the number of successful outcomes \\(N\\) is 1,080.\n\nTherefore, the probability is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1,080}{10,800} = \\frac{1}{10}\n\\]\n\nThe reduced fraction representing the probability is \\(\\frac{1}{10}\\).\n\n<<<1/10>>>"
