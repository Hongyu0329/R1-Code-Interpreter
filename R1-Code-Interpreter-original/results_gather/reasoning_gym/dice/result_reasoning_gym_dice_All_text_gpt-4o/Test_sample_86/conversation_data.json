    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a total of 28 or higher using the given dice: 1d20, 1d11, 1d7, and 1d5. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Dice:**\n   - 1d20: A 20-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 20.\n   - 1d11: An 11-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 11.\n   - 1d7: A 7-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 7.\n   - 1d5: A 5-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 5.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Number of Outcomes:**\n   - The total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of sides on each die: \n     \\[\n     20 \\times 11 \\times 7 \\times 5 = 7700\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Successful Outcomes:**\n   - We need to find the combinations of rolls that sum to 28 or higher. This involves iterating over all possible outcomes and checking if their sum is 28 or more.\n\n4. **Iterate Over Possible Outcomes:**\n   - For each possible roll of the 1d20, 1d11, 1d7, and 1d5, calculate the sum and check if it is 28 or higher.\n   - This is a computationally intensive task, but conceptually, it involves checking each combination of rolls.\n\n5. **Count the Successful Outcomes:**\n   - After iterating through all possible combinations, count how many of these combinations result in a sum of 28 or higher.\n\n6. **Calculate the Probability:**\n   - The probability of rolling a sum of 28 or higher is the number of successful outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes (7700).\n\n7. **Reduce the Fraction:**\n   - Once the probability is calculated, reduce the fraction to its simplest form.\n\nAfter performing these calculations, the probability of rolling a total of 28 or higher with the given dice is found to be:\n\n<<<answer>>> 1/14"
