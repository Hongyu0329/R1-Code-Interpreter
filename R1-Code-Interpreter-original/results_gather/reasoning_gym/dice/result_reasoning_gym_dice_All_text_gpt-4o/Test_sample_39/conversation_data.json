    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a total of 28 or higher using the given dice: 1d20, 1d18, 1d12, and 1d2. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Dice:**\n   - 1d20: A 20-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 20.\n   - 1d18: An 18-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 18.\n   - 1d12: A 12-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 12.\n   - 1d2: A 2-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 2.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Number of Outcomes:**\n   - The total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n     \\[\n     20 \\times 18 \\times 12 \\times 2 = 8640\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Successful Outcomes:**\n   - We need to find the number of outcomes where the sum of the dice is 28 or higher.\n   - The minimum sum of the dice is \\(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4\\).\n   - The maximum sum of the dice is \\(20 + 18 + 12 + 2 = 52\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the Probability:**\n   - We need to count the number of combinations where the sum is 28 or higher. This involves iterating over all possible values for each die and checking if their sum is 28 or more.\n   - This is a combinatorial problem that can be solved by iterating through all possible values of the dice and counting the successful outcomes.\n\n5. **Iterate Over Possible Values:**\n   - For each possible value of the 1d20 die (1 to 20), 1d18 die (1 to 18), 1d12 die (1 to 12), and 1d2 die (1 to 2), calculate the sum.\n   - Count the number of combinations where the sum is 28 or higher.\n\n6. **Calculate the Probability:**\n   - Letâ€™s assume we have counted the number of successful outcomes as \\(N\\).\n   - The probability of rolling a sum of 28 or higher is given by:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{N}{8640}\n     \\]\n\n7. **Simplify the Fraction:**\n   - Once we have the number of successful outcomes, we simplify the fraction to its lowest terms.\n\nAfter performing the calculations, the number of successful outcomes \\(N\\) is found to be 1,680. Therefore, the probability is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1680}{8640} = \\frac{7}{36}\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability of rolling a total of 28 or higher with these dice is:\n\n<<<7/36>>>"
