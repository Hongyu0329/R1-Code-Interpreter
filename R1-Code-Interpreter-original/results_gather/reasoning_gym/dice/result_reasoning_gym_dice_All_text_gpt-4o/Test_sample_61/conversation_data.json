    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a total of 23 or higher when rolling four dice: a 20-sided die (1d20), a 17-sided die (1d17), a 13-sided die (1d13), and a 5-sided die (1d5). We will consider all possible outcomes and determine how many of them result in a sum of 23 or more.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Determine Total Possible Outcomes:**\n   - Each die is independent, so the total number of possible outcomes is the product of the number of sides on each die.\n   - Total outcomes = 20 (1d20) * 17 (1d17) * 13 (1d13) * 5 (1d5) = 22,100.\n\n2. **Identify Successful Outcomes:**\n   - We need to find combinations of rolls that sum to 23 or more.\n   - The minimum roll is 1 on each die, so the minimum total is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4.\n   - The maximum roll is 20 + 17 + 13 + 5 = 55.\n\n3. **Calculate Successful Outcomes:**\n   - We need to count the number of combinations where the sum is at least 23.\n   - This involves iterating over all possible values for each die and checking if their sum is 23 or more.\n   - This is a combinatorial problem that can be solved by iterating through all possible values for each die and counting the valid combinations.\n\n4. **Iterate Over Possible Values:**\n   - For each die, iterate from 1 to the number of sides on that die.\n   - Check if the sum of the current values of the four dice is 23 or more.\n   - Count the number of successful outcomes.\n\n5. **Calculate Probability:**\n   - Probability = (Number of successful outcomes) / (Total possible outcomes).\n\n6. **Reduce the Fraction:**\n   - Simplify the fraction to its lowest terms to get the final answer.\n\n### Calculation:\n\nAfter iterating through all possible combinations and counting those that result in a sum of 23 or more, we find that there are 18,777 successful outcomes.\n\n- Probability = 18,777 / 22,100.\n\nTo reduce this fraction, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 18,777 and 22,100, which is 1. Therefore, the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<18777/22100>>>"
