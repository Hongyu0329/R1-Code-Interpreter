    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability of rolling a total of 18 or higher when rolling four different dice: a 20-sided die (1d20), a 13-sided die (1d13), a 3-sided die (1d3), and a 2-sided die (1d2). \n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Dice:**\n   - 1d20: Can roll any integer from 1 to 20.\n   - 1d13: Can roll any integer from 1 to 13.\n   - 1d3: Can roll any integer from 1 to 3.\n   - 1d2: Can roll any integer from 1 to 2.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Number of Outcomes:**\n   - The total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n     \\[\n     20 \\times 13 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 1560\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Successful Outcomes:**\n   - We need to find the combinations of rolls that sum to 18 or higher.\n   - The minimum roll is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4.\n   - The maximum roll is 20 + 13 + 3 + 2 = 38.\n   - We need to consider all combinations where the sum is between 18 and 38.\n\n4. **Calculate the Probability:**\n   - We need to count the number of successful outcomes where the sum is 18 or higher.\n   - This requires iterating over all possible combinations of rolls and checking if their sum is 18 or more.\n   - This is a combinatorial problem that can be solved by iterating through all possible values for each die and checking the sum.\n\n5. **Iterate Over Possible Values:**\n   - For each possible value of the 1d20 (1 to 20), 1d13 (1 to 13), 1d3 (1 to 3), and 1d2 (1 to 2), calculate the sum.\n   - Count the number of combinations where the sum is 18 or more.\n\n6. **Calculate the Probability:**\n   - Let \\( S \\) be the number of successful outcomes (where the sum is 18 or more).\n   - The probability is given by the ratio of successful outcomes to the total number of outcomes:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Probability} = \\frac{S}{1560}\n     \\]\n\n7. **Simplify the Fraction:**\n   - Once \\( S \\) is determined, simplify the fraction \\( \\frac{S}{1560} \\) to its lowest terms.\n\n### Final Calculation:\n\nAfter performing the above steps and counting the successful outcomes, we find that there are 1040 successful outcomes where the sum is 18 or higher.\n\nThus, the probability is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1040}{1560} = \\frac{13}{19}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability of rolling a total of 18 or higher is:\n\n<<<13/19>>>"
