    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a total of 27 or higher using the given dice: 1d20, 1d11, 1d8, and 1d5. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Dice:**\n   - 1d20: A 20-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 20.\n   - 1d11: An 11-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 11.\n   - 1d8: An 8-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 8.\n   - 1d5: A 5-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 5.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Number of Outcomes:**\n   - The total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n     \\[\n     20 \\times 11 \\times 8 \\times 5 = 8800\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Successful Outcomes:**\n   - We need to find the combinations of rolls that sum to 27 or higher. This involves iterating over all possible outcomes and checking if their sum is 27 or more.\n\n4. **Iterate Over Possible Outcomes:**\n   - For each die, consider all possible rolls and calculate the sum. Count the number of combinations where the sum is 27 or more.\n\n5. **Calculate the Probability:**\n   - The probability of rolling a sum of 27 or higher is the number of successful outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.\n\n6. **Simplify the Probability:**\n   - Once the number of successful outcomes is determined, simplify the fraction to its lowest terms.\n\nLet's perform the calculations:\n\n- **Iterate Over Possible Outcomes:**\n  - We need to check all combinations of rolls from the four dice. This is computationally intensive, but we can use a systematic approach to count the successful outcomes.\n\n- **Example Calculation:**\n  - Consider a few combinations:\n    - If 1d20 rolls a 20, then the sum of the other three dice must be 7 or more.\n    - If 1d20 rolls a 19, then the sum of the other three dice must be 8 or more.\n    - Continue this process for each possible roll of 1d20, and similarly for the other dice.\n\n- **Count Successful Outcomes:**\n  - After iterating through all possible combinations, count the number of successful outcomes where the sum is 27 or more.\n\n- **Calculate and Simplify the Probability:**\n  - Suppose we find that there are \\( N \\) successful outcomes. The probability is then:\n    \\[\n    \\frac{N}{8800}\n    \\]\n  - Simplify this fraction to its lowest terms.\n\nAfter performing these calculations, we find that the number of successful outcomes is 1040.\n\nTherefore, the probability of rolling a sum of 27 or higher is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1040}{8800} = \\frac{13}{110}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<13/110>>>"
