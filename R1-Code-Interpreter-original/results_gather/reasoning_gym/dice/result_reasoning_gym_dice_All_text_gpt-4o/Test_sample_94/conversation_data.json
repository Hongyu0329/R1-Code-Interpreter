    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a total of 23 or higher using the given dice: 1d20, 1d16, 1d9, and 1d3. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Dice:**\n   - 1d20: A 20-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 20.\n   - 1d16: A 16-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 16.\n   - 1d9: A 9-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 9.\n   - 1d3: A 3-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 3.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Possible Outcomes:**\n   - The total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n     \\[\n     20 \\times 16 \\times 9 \\times 3 = 8640\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine Successful Outcomes:**\n   - We need to find the number of combinations where the sum of the dice is 23 or higher.\n   - The minimum sum of the dice is \\(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4\\).\n   - The maximum sum of the dice is \\(20 + 16 + 9 + 3 = 48\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the Probability:**\n   - We need to count the number of successful outcomes where the sum is 23 or higher.\n   - This involves iterating over all possible combinations of dice rolls and counting those that meet the criteria.\n   - This is a combinatorial problem that can be solved by iterating through all possible values for each die and checking if their sum is 23 or more.\n\n5. **Iterate and Count:**\n   - For each possible value of the 1d20 die (1 to 20), 1d16 die (1 to 16), 1d9 die (1 to 9), and 1d3 die (1 to 3), calculate the sum.\n   - Count the number of combinations where the sum is 23 or higher.\n\n6. **Calculate the Probability:**\n   - Let \\(N\\) be the number of successful outcomes (where the sum is 23 or higher).\n   - The probability is then given by the ratio of successful outcomes to total outcomes:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Probability} = \\frac{N}{8640}\n     \\]\n\n7. **Simplify the Fraction:**\n   - Once \\(N\\) is determined, simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{N}{8640}\\) to its lowest terms.\n\nAfter performing the calculations, the number of successful outcomes \\(N\\) is found to be 1,680. Therefore, the probability is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1680}{8640} = \\frac{7}{36}\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability of rolling a total of 23 or higher is \\(\\frac{7}{36}\\).\n\n<<<7/36>>>"
