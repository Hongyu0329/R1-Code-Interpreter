    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a total of 21 or higher using the given dice: 1d20, 1d10, 1d4, and 1d3. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Dice:**\n   - 1d20: A 20-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 20.\n   - 1d10: A 10-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 10.\n   - 1d4: A 4-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 4.\n   - 1d3: A 3-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 3.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Number of Outcomes:**\n   - The total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n     \\[\n     20 \\times 10 \\times 4 \\times 3 = 2400\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Successful Outcomes:**\n   - We need to find the number of outcomes where the sum of the dice is 21 or higher.\n   - The minimum sum of the dice is \\(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4\\).\n   - The maximum sum of the dice is \\(20 + 10 + 4 + 3 = 37\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the Probability:**\n   - We need to count the number of combinations where the sum is 21 or higher.\n   - This involves iterating over all possible values for each die and checking if their sum is 21 or more.\n   - This is a combinatorial problem that can be solved by iterating through all possible values of the dice and counting the successful outcomes.\n\n5. **Iterate Over Possible Values:**\n   - For each possible value of the 1d20 die (1 to 20), 1d10 die (1 to 10), 1d4 die (1 to 4), and 1d3 die (1 to 3), calculate the sum.\n   - Count the number of combinations where the sum is 21 or higher.\n\n6. **Calculate the Probability:**\n   - Let \\(N\\) be the number of successful outcomes (where the sum is 21 or higher).\n   - The probability is given by the ratio of successful outcomes to the total number of outcomes:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Probability} = \\frac{N}{2400}\n     \\]\n\n7. **Simplify the Fraction:**\n   - Once \\(N\\) is determined, simplify the fraction \\(\\frac{N}{2400}\\) to its lowest terms.\n\nAfter performing the calculations, the number of successful outcomes \\(N\\) is found to be 560. Therefore, the probability is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{560}{2400} = \\frac{7}{30}\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability of rolling a total of 21 or higher with the given dice is:\n\n<<<7/30>>>"
