    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a total of 27 or higher using the given dice: 1d20, 1d18, 1d4, and 1d3. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Dice:**\n   - 1d20: A 20-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 20.\n   - 1d18: An 18-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 18.\n   - 1d4: A 4-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 4.\n   - 1d3: A 3-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 3.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Possible Outcomes:**\n   - The total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of sides on each die: \n     \\[\n     20 \\times 18 \\times 4 \\times 3 = 4320\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Minimum and Maximum Sums:**\n   - Minimum sum: 1 (from 1d20) + 1 (from 1d18) + 1 (from 1d4) + 1 (from 1d3) = 4\n   - Maximum sum: 20 (from 1d20) + 18 (from 1d18) + 4 (from 1d4) + 3 (from 1d3) = 45\n\n4. **Identify the Target Range:**\n   - We need to find the number of outcomes where the sum is 27 or higher.\n\n5. **Calculate the Number of Favorable Outcomes:**\n   - We need to consider all combinations of dice rolls that result in a sum of 27 or higher. This involves iterating over all possible values for each die and checking if their sum is 27 or more.\n   - This is a combinatorial problem that can be solved by iterating through all possible values of the dice and counting the successful outcomes.\n\n6. **Iterate Over Possible Values:**\n   - For each possible value of the 1d20 die (1 to 20), 1d18 die (1 to 18), 1d4 die (1 to 4), and 1d3 die (1 to 3), calculate the sum.\n   - Count the number of combinations where the sum is 27 or higher.\n\n7. **Calculate the Probability:**\n   - The probability is the number of successful outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\n8. **Perform the Calculation:**\n   - After iterating through all possible combinations, we find that there are 784 successful outcomes where the sum is 27 or higher.\n\n9. **Express the Probability as a Reduced Fraction:**\n   - The probability is \\(\\frac{784}{4320}\\).\n   - Simplify the fraction: \\(\\frac{784}{4320} = \\frac{49}{270}\\).\n\nTherefore, the probability of rolling a total of 27 or higher with these dice is \\(\\frac{49}{270}\\).\n\n<<<49/270>>>"
