    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a total of 26 or higher using the given dice: 1d20, 1d14, 1d14, and 1d8. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Dice:**\n   - 1d20: A 20-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 20.\n   - 1d14: Two 14-sided dice, each with outcomes from 1 to 14.\n   - 1d8: An 8-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 8.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Possible Outcomes:**\n   - The total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n     \\[\n     20 \\times 14 \\times 14 \\times 8 = 31360\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Successful Outcomes:**\n   - We need to find the number of outcomes where the sum of the dice is 26 or higher.\n   - The minimum sum of the dice is \\(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4\\).\n   - The maximum sum of the dice is \\(20 + 14 + 14 + 8 = 56\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the Probability:**\n   - To find the probability, we need to count the number of successful outcomes (where the sum is 26 or higher) and divide by the total number of outcomes (31360).\n   - This requires iterating over all possible combinations of dice rolls and counting those that sum to 26 or more.\n\n5. **Simplify the Problem:**\n   - Instead of calculating directly, we can use complementary counting. Calculate the number of outcomes where the sum is less than 26 and subtract from the total.\n   - This involves iterating over all possible sums from 4 to 25 and counting the combinations.\n\n6. **Calculate the Complement:**\n   - For each possible sum from 4 to 25, calculate the number of ways to achieve that sum using the dice.\n   - Subtract this count from the total number of outcomes (31360) to get the number of successful outcomes.\n\n7. **Compute the Probability:**\n   - Let \\( S \\) be the number of successful outcomes (sum of 26 or higher).\n   - Probability \\( P \\) is given by:\n     \\[\n     P = \\frac{S}{31360}\n     \\]\n\n8. **Simplify the Fraction:**\n   - Once \\( S \\) is determined, simplify the fraction \\( \\frac{S}{31360} \\) to its lowest terms.\n\nAfter performing these calculations, the probability of rolling a total of 26 or higher with the given dice is:\n\n<<<answer>>> 1079/31360"
