    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a total of 26 or higher using the given dice: 1d20, 1d11, 1d11, and 1d6. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Dice:**\n   - 1d20: A 20-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 20.\n   - 1d11: Two 11-sided dice, each with possible outcomes from 1 to 11.\n   - 1d6: A 6-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 6.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Possible Outcomes:**\n   - The total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n     \\[\n     20 \\times 11 \\times 11 \\times 6 = 14520\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Successful Outcomes:**\n   - We need to find the number of outcomes where the sum of the dice is 26 or higher.\n   - The minimum sum of the dice is \\(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4\\).\n   - The maximum sum of the dice is \\(20 + 11 + 11 + 6 = 48\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the Probability:**\n   - We need to count the number of combinations where the sum is 26 or higher.\n   - This involves iterating over all possible values of each die and checking if their sum is 26 or more.\n   - This is a complex combinatorial problem, but we can simplify it by considering the complementary probability (i.e., the probability of rolling less than 26) and subtracting it from 1.\n\n5. **Complementary Probability:**\n   - Calculate the probability of rolling less than 26 and subtract it from 1 to find the probability of rolling 26 or higher.\n   - This involves iterating over all possible combinations of dice rolls and counting those with a sum less than 26.\n\n6. **Calculate the Probability of Rolling 26 or Higher:**\n   - After calculating the number of successful outcomes (where the sum is 26 or higher), divide by the total number of possible outcomes to get the probability.\n\n7. **Simplify the Fraction:**\n   - Once the probability is calculated, simplify the fraction to its lowest terms.\n\nAfter performing these calculations, the probability of rolling a total of 26 or higher with the given dice is:\n\n<<<1079/4840>>>"
