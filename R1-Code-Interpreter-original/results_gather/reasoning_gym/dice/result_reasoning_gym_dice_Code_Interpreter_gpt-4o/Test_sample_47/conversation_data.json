    "\nassistant > To find the probability of rolling a total of 26 or higher with the given dice (1d20, 1d16, 1d13, 1d6), we need to consider all possible outcomes and count the number of successful outcomes where the sum is 26 or more.\n\n1. **Total Possible Outcomes**: \n   - The total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of sides on each die: \\(20 \\times 16 \\times 13 \\times 6\\).\n\n2. **Successful Outcomes**:\n   - We need to count the number of outcomes where the sum of the dice is 26 or more.\n\nLet's calculate these values.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Number of sides on each die\nsides = [20, 16, 13, 6]\n\n# Total number of possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 1\nfor side in sides:\n    total_outcomes *= side\n\n# Generate all possible outcomes\nall_rolls = product(range(1, sides[0] + 1), range(1, sides[1] + 1), range(1, sides[2] + 1), range(1, sides[3] + 1))\n\n# Count successful outcomes where the sum is 26 or more\nsuccessful_outcomes = sum(1 for roll in all_rolls if sum(roll) >= 26)\n\n# Probability as a reduced fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability = Fraction(successful_outcomes, total_outcomes).limit_denominator()\n\nprobability\nassistant > The probability of rolling a total of 26 or higher with the given dice is \\(\\frac{5599}{8320}\\).\n\nThus, the answer is <<<5599/8320>>>."
