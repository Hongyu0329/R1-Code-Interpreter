    "\nassistant > To find the probability of rolling a total of 26 or higher with the dice 1d20, 1d8, 1d6, and 1d4, we need to consider the possible outcomes for each die and calculate the total number of successful outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes.\n\n1. **Total Possible Outcomes**: \n   - 1d20 has 20 possible outcomes.\n   - 1d8 has 8 possible outcomes.\n   - 1d6 has 6 possible outcomes.\n   - 1d4 has 4 possible outcomes.\n   \n   The total number of possible outcomes is the product of the possible outcomes for each die: \\(20 \\times 8 \\times 6 \\times 4\\).\n\n2. **Successful Outcomes**:\n   - We need to find the combinations of rolls that sum to 26 or higher.\n\nLet's calculate these values.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the number of sides for each die\nsides = [20, 8, 6, 4]\n\n# Calculate total possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 1\nfor side in sides:\n    total_outcomes *= side\n\n# Generate all possible outcomes\noutcomes = product(range(1, 21), range(1, 9), range(1, 7), range(1, 5))\n\n# Count successful outcomes (sum >= 26)\nsuccessful_outcomes = sum(1 for outcome in outcomes if sum(outcome) >= 26)\n\n# Calculate probability as a reduced fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability = Fraction(successful_outcomes, total_outcomes)\n\nprobability\nassistant > The probability of rolling a total of 26 or higher with the dice 1d20, 1d8, 1d6, and 1d4 is \\(\\frac{1061}{3840}\\).\n\nThe final answer is: <<<1061/3840>>>."
