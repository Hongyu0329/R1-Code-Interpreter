    "\nassistant > To find the probability of rolling a total of 21 or higher with the given dice, we need to consider the possible outcomes for each die and calculate the total number of successful outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nThe dice are:\n- 1d20: A 20-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 20.\n- 1d7: Two 7-sided dice, each with outcomes from 1 to 7.\n- 1d4: A 4-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 4.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of possible outcomes:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total outcomes} = 20 \\times 7 \\times 7 \\times 4\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the number of successful outcomes where the sum of the dice is 21 or higher. We will iterate over all possible outcomes and count those that meet the criteria.\n\nLet's calculate this.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the range of outcomes for each die\nd20 = range(1, 21)\nd7_1 = range(1, 8)\nd7_2 = range(1, 8)\nd4 = range(1, 5)\n\n# Calculate total number of possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = len(d20) * len(d7_1) * len(d7_2) * len(d4)\n\n# Calculate the number of successful outcomes (sum >= 21)\nsuccessful_outcomes = sum(\n    1 for outcome in product(d20, d7_1, d7_2, d4) if sum(outcome) >= 21\n)\n\n# Calculate the probability as a reduced fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\nprobability = Fraction(successful_outcomes, total_outcomes)\nprobability\nassistant > The probability of rolling a total of 21 or higher with the given dice is \\(\\frac{21}{40}\\).\n\nThe final answer is: <<<21/40>>>."
