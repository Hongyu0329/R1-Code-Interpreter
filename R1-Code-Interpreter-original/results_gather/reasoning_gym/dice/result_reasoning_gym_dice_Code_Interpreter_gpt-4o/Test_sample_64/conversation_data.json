    "\nassistant > To find the probability of rolling a total of 28 or higher with the dice 1d20, 1d14, 1d13, and 1d12, we need to consider the possible outcomes for each die and calculate the number of favorable outcomes.\n\n1. **Total number of outcomes**: Each die has a certain number of sides, so the total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total outcomes} = 20 \\times 14 \\times 13 \\times 12\n   \\]\n\n2. **Favorable outcomes**: We need to count the number of ways to roll a total of 28 or higher. This involves iterating over all possible combinations of rolls and checking if their sum is 28 or more.\n\nLet's calculate these values.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Number of sides on each die\nsides = [20, 14, 13, 12]\n\n# Total number of outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 1\nfor side in sides:\n    total_outcomes *= side\n\n# Calculate favorable outcomes\nfavorable_outcomes = 0\n\n# Iterate over all possible outcomes\nfor roll in product(*(range(1, side + 1) for side in sides)):\n    if sum(roll) >= 28:\n        favorable_outcomes += 1\n\n# Calculate probability as a reduced fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability = Fraction(favorable_outcomes, total_outcomes)\n\nprobability\nassistant > The probability of rolling a total of 28 or higher with the dice 1d20, 1d14, 1d13, and 1d12 is \\(\\frac{2089}{3120}\\).\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<2089/3120>>>"
