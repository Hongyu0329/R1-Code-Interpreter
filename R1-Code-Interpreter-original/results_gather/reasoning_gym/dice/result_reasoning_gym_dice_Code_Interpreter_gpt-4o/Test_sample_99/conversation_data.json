    "\nassistant > To find the probability of rolling a total of 25 or higher with the given dice, we need to consider all possible outcomes and count the favorable ones.\n\nThe dice are:\n- 1d20: A 20-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 20.\n- 1d18: An 18-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 18.\n- 1d13: A 13-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 13.\n- 1d12: A 12-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 12.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n\\[ 20 \\times 18 \\times 13 \\times 12 \\]\n\nWe need to count the number of outcomes where the sum of the dice is 25 or higher.
