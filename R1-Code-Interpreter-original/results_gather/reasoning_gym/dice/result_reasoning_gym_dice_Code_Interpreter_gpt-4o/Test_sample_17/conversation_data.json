    "\nassistant > To find the probability of rolling a total of 23 or higher with the dice 1d20, 1d15, 1d13, and 1d4, we need to consider the possible outcomes for each die and calculate the total number of successful outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes.\n\n1. **Total Possible Outcomes**: \n   - 1d20 has 20 possible outcomes.\n   - 1d15 has 15 possible outcomes.\n   - 1d13 has 13 possible outcomes.\n   - 1d4 has 4 possible outcomes.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of outcomes for each die:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Possible Outcomes} = 20 \\times 15 \\times 13 \\times 4 \\]\n\n2. **Successful Outcomes**:\n   - We need to find the number of combinations where the sum of the dice is 23 or higher.\n\nLet's calculate these values and determine the probability.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the number of sides for each die\nsides = [20, 15, 13, 4]\n\n# Calculate total possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 1\nfor side in sides:\n    total_outcomes *= side\n\n# Generate all possible outcomes\noutcomes = product(range(1, sides[0] + 1), range(1, sides[1] + 1), range(1, sides[2] + 1), range(1, sides[3] + 1))\n\n# Count successful outcomes where the sum is 23 or higher\nsuccessful_outcomes = sum(1 for outcome in outcomes if sum(outcome) >= 23)\n\n# Calculate probability as a reduced fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability = Fraction(successful_outcomes, total_outcomes)\n\nprobability\nassistant > The probability of rolling a total of 23 or higher with the dice 1d20, 1d15, 1d13, and 1d4 is \\(\\frac{11501}{15600}\\).\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<11501/15600>>>"
