    "\nassistant > To find the probability of rolling a total of 31 or higher with the given dice, we need to consider the possible outcomes for each die and calculate the total number of successful outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nThe dice are:\n- 1d20: A 20-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 20.\n- 1d12: A 12-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 12.\n- 1d8: An 8-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 8.\n- 1d5: A 5-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 5.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of possible outcomes by multiplying the number of sides on each die:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total outcomes} = 20 \\times 12 \\times 8 \\times 5\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the number of successful outcomes where the sum of the dice is 31 or higher. We will iterate over all possible outcomes and count the successful ones.
