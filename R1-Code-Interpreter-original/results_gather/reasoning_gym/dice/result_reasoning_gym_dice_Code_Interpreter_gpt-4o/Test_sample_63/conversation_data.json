    "\nassistant > To find the probability of rolling a total of 32 or higher with the given dice, we need to consider all possible outcomes and count the number of successful outcomes that result in a sum of 32 or more.\n\nThe dice you have are:\n- 1d20: A 20-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 20.\n- 1d19: Two 19-sided dice with outcomes from 1 to 19.\n- 1d18: An 18-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 18.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n\\[ 20 \\times 19 \\times 19 \\times 18 \\]\n\nWe need to calculate the number of successful outcomes where the sum of the dice is 32 or more.
