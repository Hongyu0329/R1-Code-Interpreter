    "\nassistant > To find the probability of rolling a total of 28 or higher with the given dice, we need to consider all possible outcomes of rolling each die and count the number of outcomes that result in a sum of 28 or more.\n\nThe dice are:\n- 1d20: A 20-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 20.\n- 1d14: A 14-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 14.\n- 1d6: A 6-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 6.\n- 1d4: A 4-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 4.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of possible outcomes by multiplying the number of sides on each die:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total outcomes} = 20 \\times 14 \\times 6 \\times 4\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to count the number of favorable outcomes where the sum of the dice is 28 or higher. We will iterate over all possible outcomes and count those that meet the criteria.\n\nFinally, the probability is the ratio of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes, which we will express as a reduced fraction.\n\nLet's perform these calculations.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import product\nfrom math import gcd\n\n# Number of sides on each die\nsides = [20, 14, 6, 4]\n\n# Calculate total number of outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 1\nfor side in sides:\n    total_outcomes *= side\n\n# Calculate number of favorable outcomes\nfavorable_outcomes = 0\n\n# Iterate over all possible outcomes\nfor outcome in product(range(1, 21), range(1, 15), range(1, 7), range(1, 5)):\n    if sum(outcome) >= 28:\n        favorable_outcomes += 1\n\n# Calculate probability as a fraction\nnumerator = favorable_outcomes\ndenominator = total_outcomes\n\n# Reduce the fraction\ncommon_divisor = gcd(numerator, denominator)\nreduced_numerator = numerator // common_divisor\nreduced_denominator = denominator // common_divisor\n\nreduced_fraction = f\"{reduced_numerator}/{reduced_denominator}\"\nreduced_fraction\nassistant > The probability of rolling a total of 28 or higher with the given dice is \\(\\frac{317}{960}\\).\n\n<<<317/960>>>"
