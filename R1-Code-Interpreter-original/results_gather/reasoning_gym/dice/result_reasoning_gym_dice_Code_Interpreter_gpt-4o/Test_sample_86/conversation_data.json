    "\nassistant > To find the probability of rolling a total of 28 or higher with the given dice, we need to consider all possible outcomes and count the favorable ones.\n\nThe dice are:\n- 1d20: A 20-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 20.\n- 1d11: An 11-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 11.\n- 1d7: A 7-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 7.\n- 1d5: A 5-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 5.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n\\[ 20 \\times 11 \\times 7 \\times 5 \\]\n\nWe need to count the number of outcomes where the sum of the dice is 28 or higher.
