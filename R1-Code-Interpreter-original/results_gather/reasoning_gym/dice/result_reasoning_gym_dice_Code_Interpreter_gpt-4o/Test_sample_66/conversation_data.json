    "\nassistant > To find the probability of rolling a total of 32 or higher with the given dice, we need to consider the possible outcomes for each die and calculate the total number of successful outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nThe dice you have are:\n- 1d20: A 20-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 20.\n- 1d13: Two 13-sided dice, each with outcomes from 1 to 13.\n- 1d3: A 3-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 3.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of possible outcomes:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total outcomes} = 20 \\times 13 \\times 13 \\times 3\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the number of successful outcomes where the sum of the dice is 32 or higher.
