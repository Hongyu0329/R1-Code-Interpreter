    "\nassistant > To find the probability of rolling a total of 28 or higher with the given dice, we need to consider the possible outcomes for each die and calculate the total number of successful outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nThe dice you have are:\n- 1d20: A 20-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 20.\n- 1d14: A 14-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 14.\n- 1d8: An 8-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 8.\n- 1d4: A 4-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 4.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n\\[ 20 \\times 14 \\times 8 \\times 4 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of successful outcomes where the sum of the dice is 28 or higher. We can do this by iterating over all possible combinations of dice rolls and counting those that meet the criteria.\n\nLet's calculate this probability.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the number of sides for each die\nsides = [20, 14, 8, 4]\n\n# Calculate the total number of possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 1\nfor side in sides:\n    total_outcomes *= side\n\n# Calculate the number of successful outcomes\nsuccessful_outcomes = 0\n\n# Iterate over all possible combinations of dice rolls\nfor roll in product(range(1, sides[0] + 1), range(1, sides[1] + 1), range(1, sides[2] + 1), range(1, sides[3] + 1)):\n    if sum(roll) >= 28:\n        successful_outcomes += 1\n\n# Calculate the probability as a reduced fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability = Fraction(successful_outcomes, total_outcomes)\n\nprobability\nassistant > The probability of rolling a total of 28 or higher with the given dice is \\(\\frac{97}{256}\\).\n\nThe final answer is: <<<97/256>>>."
