    "\nassistant > To find the probability of rolling a 19 or higher with the given dice, we need to consider the possible outcomes for each die and the combinations that result in a sum of 19 or higher.\n\nThe dice are:\n- 1d20: A 20-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 20.\n- 1d12: A 12-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 12.\n- 1d3: A 3-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 3.\n- 1d2: A 2-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 2.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total outcomes} = 20 \\times 12 \\times 3 \\times 2\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of favorable outcomes where the sum of the dice is 19 or higher. We'll iterate through all possible combinations and count those that meet the criteria.
