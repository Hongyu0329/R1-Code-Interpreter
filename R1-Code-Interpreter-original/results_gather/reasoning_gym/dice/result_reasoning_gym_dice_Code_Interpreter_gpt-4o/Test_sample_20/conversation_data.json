    "\nassistant > To find the probability of rolling a total of 34 or higher with the given dice, we need to consider the possible outcomes for each die and calculate the total number of successful outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nThe dice are:\n- 1d20: A 20-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 20.\n- 1d18: An 18-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 18.\n- 1d10: A 10-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 10.\n- 1d3: A 3-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 3.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n\\[ \\text{Total outcomes} = 20 \\times 18 \\times 10 \\times 3 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of successful outcomes where the sum of the dice is 34 or higher.
