    "\nassistant > To find the probability of rolling a total of 28 or higher with the given dice, we need to consider all possible outcomes and count the number of successful outcomes that result in a sum of 28 or more.\n\nThe dice are:\n- 1d20: A 20-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 20.\n- 1d17: A 17-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 17.\n- 1d8: An 8-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 8.\n- 1d4: A 4-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 4.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of possible outcomes by multiplying the number of sides on each die. Then, we count the number of successful outcomes where the sum is 28 or higher.\n\nLet's calculate this probability.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the number of sides for each die\nsides = [20, 17, 8, 4]\n\n# Calculate the total number of possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 1\nfor side in sides:\n    total_outcomes *= side\n\n# Generate all possible outcomes\noutcomes = product(range(1, sides[0] + 1), range(1, sides[1] + 1), range(1, sides[2] + 1), range(1, sides[3] + 1))\n\n# Count the number of successful outcomes (sum >= 28)\nsuccessful_outcomes = sum(1 for outcome in outcomes if sum(outcome) >= 28)\n\n# Calculate the probability as a reduced fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability = Fraction(successful_outcomes, total_outcomes)\n\nprobability\nassistant > The probability of rolling a total of 28 or higher with the given dice is \\(\\frac{2463}{5440}\\).\n\nThus, the answer is <<<2463/5440>>>."
