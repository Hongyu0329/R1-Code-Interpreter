    "\nassistant > To find the probability of rolling a total of 38 or higher with the given dice (1d20, 1d17, 1d14, 1d5), we need to consider the possible outcomes for each die and calculate the number of favorable outcomes.\n\n1. **Total Possible Outcomes**: \n   - 1d20 has 20 possible outcomes.\n   - 1d17 has 17 possible outcomes.\n   - 1d14 has 14 possible outcomes.\n   - 1d5 has 5 possible outcomes.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes when all dice are rolled is the product of the number of outcomes for each die:\n\\[ 20 \\times 17 \\times 14 \\times 5 \\]\n\n2. **Favorable Outcomes**:\n   We need to find the number of combinations where the sum of the dice is 38 or higher.
