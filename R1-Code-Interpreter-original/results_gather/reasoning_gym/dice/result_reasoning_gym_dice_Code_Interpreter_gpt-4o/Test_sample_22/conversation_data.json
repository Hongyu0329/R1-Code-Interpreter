    "\nassistant > To find the probability of rolling a total of 32 or higher with the given dice, we need to consider all possible outcomes and count the favorable ones.\n\nThe dice are:\n- 1d20: A 20-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 20.\n- 1d19: A 19-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 19.\n- 1d16: A 16-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 16.\n- 1d6: A 6-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 6.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n\\[ 20 \\times 19 \\times 16 \\times 6 \\]\n\nWe need to find the number of outcomes where the sum of the dice is 32 or higher.
