    "\nassistant > To find the probability of rolling a total of 35 or higher with the given dice (1d20, 1d16, 1d10, 1d9), we need to consider the possible outcomes for each die and calculate the number of favorable outcomes.\n\n1. **Total number of outcomes**: The total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n   \\[\n   20 \\times 16 \\times 10 \\times 9\n   \\]\n\n2. **Favorable outcomes**: We need to count the number of combinations where the sum of the dice is 35 or higher.\n\nLet's calculate these values.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Number of sides on each die\nsides = [20, 16, 10, 9]\n\n# Total number of outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 1\nfor side in sides:\n    total_outcomes *= side\n\n# Generate all possible outcomes\noutcomes = product(range(1, sides[0] + 1), range(1, sides[1] + 1), range(1, sides[2] + 1), range(1, sides[3] + 1))\n\n# Count favorable outcomes where the sum is 35 or higher\nfavorable_outcomes = sum(1 for outcome in outcomes if sum(outcome) >= 35)\n\n# Calculate the probability as a reduced fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability = Fraction(favorable_outcomes, total_outcomes).limit_denominator()\n\nprobability\nassistant > The probability of rolling a total of 35 or higher with the given dice is \\(\\frac{4097}{14400}\\).\n\nThe final answer is: <<<4097/14400>>>."
