    "\nassistant > To find the probability of rolling a total of 27 or higher with the given dice, we need to consider all possible outcomes and count the favorable ones.\n\nThe dice you have are:\n- 1d20: A 20-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 20.\n- 1d18: An 18-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 18.\n- 1d13: A 13-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 13.\n- 1d2: A 2-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 2.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes when rolling all these dice is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n\\[ 20 \\times 18 \\times 13 \\times 2 \\]\n\nWe need to find the number of outcomes where the sum of the dice is 27 or higher.
