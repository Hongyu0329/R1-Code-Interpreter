    "\nassistant > To find the probability of rolling a total of 34 or higher with the given dice (1d20, 1d15, 1d13, 1d4), we need to consider the possible outcomes for each die and calculate the number of favorable outcomes.\n\n1. **Total Possible Outcomes**: \n   - 1d20 has 20 possible outcomes.\n   - 1d15 has 15 possible outcomes.\n   - 1d13 has 13 possible outcomes.\n   - 1d4 has 4 possible outcomes.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of outcomes for each die:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Outcomes} = 20 \\times 15 \\times 13 \\times 4 \\]\n\n2. **Favorable Outcomes**:\n   - We need to find the number of combinations where the sum of the dice is 34 or higher.\n\nLet's calculate these values.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the number of sides for each die\nsides = [20, 15, 13, 4]\n\n# Calculate total possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 1\nfor side in sides:\n    total_outcomes *= side\n\n# Generate all possible outcomes\nall_outcomes = product(range(1, sides[0] + 1), range(1, sides[1] + 1), range(1, sides[2] + 1), range(1, sides[3] + 1))\n\n# Count favorable outcomes (sum >= 34)\nfavorable_outcomes = sum(1 for outcome in all_outcomes if sum(outcome) >= 34)\n\n# Calculate probability as a reduced fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability = Fraction(favorable_outcomes, total_outcomes)\n\ntotal_outcomes, favorable_outcomes, probability\nassistant > The total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is 15,600.
