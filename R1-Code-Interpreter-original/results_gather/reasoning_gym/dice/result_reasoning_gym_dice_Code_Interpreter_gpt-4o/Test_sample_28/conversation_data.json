    "\nassistant > To find the probability of rolling a total of 26 or higher with the given dice, we need to consider the possible outcomes for each die and calculate the total number of successful outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nThe dice are:\n- 1d20: A 20-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 20.\n- 1d11: Two 11-sided dice, each with outcomes from 1 to 11.\n- 1d6: A 6-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 6.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of possible outcomes:\n- 1d20 has 20 possible outcomes.\n- Each 1d11 has 11 possible outcomes, so two 1d11 dice have \\(11 \\times 11 = 121\\) possible outcomes.\n- 1d6 has 6 possible outcomes.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes when all dice are rolled is:\n\\[ 20 \\times 121 \\times 6 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of successful outcomes where the sum of the dice is 26 or higher. We will iterate over all possible combinations of dice rolls and count the successful ones.\n\nLet's perform these calculations.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the range of outcomes for each die\nd20_outcomes = range(1, 21)\nd11_outcomes = range(1, 12)\nd6_outcomes = range(1, 7)\n\n# Calculate total possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = len(d20_outcomes) * len(d11_outcomes) * len(d11_outcomes) * len(d6_outcomes)\n\n# Count successful outcomes where the sum is 26 or higher\nsuccessful_outcomes = 0\n\n# Iterate over all possible combinations of dice rolls\nfor d20, d11_1, d11_2, d6 in product(d20_outcomes, d11_outcomes, d11_outcomes, d6_outcomes):\n    if d20 + d11_1 + d11_2 + d6 >= 26:\n        successful_outcomes += 1\n\n# Calculate the probability as a reduced fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability = Fraction(successful_outcomes, total_outcomes)\n\nprobability\nassistant > The probability of rolling a total of 26 or higher with the given dice is \\(\\frac{7613}{14520}\\).\n\nThe final answer is: <<<7613/14520>>>."
