    "\nassistant > To find the probability of rolling a total of 36 or higher with the given dice, we need to consider all possible outcomes and count the number of successful outcomes that result in a sum of 36 or more.\n\nThe dice you have are:\n- 1d20: A 20-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 20.\n- 1d19: A 19-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 19.\n- 1d13: A 13-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 13.\n- 1d8: An 8-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 8.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n\\[ 20 \\times 19 \\times 13 \\times 8 \\]\n\nWe need to calculate the number of successful outcomes where the sum of the dice is 36 or higher.
