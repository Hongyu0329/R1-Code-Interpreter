    "\nassistant > To find the probability of rolling a total of 31 or higher with the given dice, we need to consider the possible outcomes for each die and calculate the total number of successful outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nThe dice are:\n- 1d20: A 20-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 20.\n- 1d18: An 18-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 18.\n- 1d10: A 10-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 10.\n- 1d3: A 3-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 3.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of possible outcomes by multiplying the number of sides on each die:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total possible outcomes} = 20 \\times 18 \\times 10 \\times 3\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the number of successful outcomes where the sum of the dice is 31 or higher. We will iterate over all possible outcomes and count the successful ones.\n\nLet's calculate this.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Number of sides on each die\nsides = [20, 18, 10, 3]\n\n# Calculate total possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 1\nfor side in sides:\n    total_outcomes *= side\n\n# Calculate successful outcomes where the sum is 31 or higher\nsuccessful_outcomes = 0\n\n# Iterate over all possible outcomes\nfor outcome in product(range(1, 21), range(1, 19), range(1, 11), range(1, 4)):\n    if sum(outcome) >= 31:\n        successful_outcomes += 1\n\n# Calculate probability as a reduced fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability = Fraction(successful_outcomes, total_outcomes)\n\nprobability\nassistant > The probability of rolling a total of 31 or higher with the given dice is \\(\\frac{659}{1800}\\).\n\nThus, the answer is <<<659/1800>>>."
