    "\nassistant > To find the probability of rolling a total of 25 or higher with the given dice, we need to consider all possible outcomes and count the favorable ones. The dice are:\n\n- 1d20: A 20-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 20.\n- 1d17: A 17-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 17.\n- 1d16: A 16-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 16.\n- 1d4: A 4-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 4.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total outcomes} = 20 \\times 17 \\times 16 \\times 4 \\]\n\nNext, we need to count the number of outcomes where the sum of the dice is 25 or higher. We can do this by iterating over all possible combinations of dice rolls and counting those that meet the criteria.\n\nLet's calculate this.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the number of sides for each die\nsides = [20, 17, 16, 4]\n\n# Calculate the total number of possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 1\nfor side in sides:\n    total_outcomes *= side\n\n# Count the number of favorable outcomes (sum >= 25)\nfavorable_outcomes = 0\n\n# Iterate over all possible outcomes\nfor roll in product(*(range(1, side + 1) for side in sides)):\n    if sum(roll) >= 25:\n        favorable_outcomes += 1\n\n# Calculate the probability as a reduced fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability = Fraction(favorable_outcomes, total_outcomes)\n\nprobability\nassistant > The probability of rolling a total of 25 or higher with the given dice is \\(\\frac{4021}{5440}\\).\n\nThus, the answer is <<<4021/5440>>>."
