    "\nassistant > To find the probability of rolling a total of 22 or higher with the given dice (1d20, 1d15, 1d13, 1d8), we need to consider all possible outcomes and count the number of successful outcomes that result in a sum of 22 or more.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of possible outcomes. Each die has a certain number of sides, so the total number of outcomes is the product of the number of sides of all the dice:\n\n- 1d20 has 20 possible outcomes.\n- 1d15 has 15 possible outcomes.\n- 1d13 has 13 possible outcomes.\n- 1d8 has 8 possible outcomes.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is:\n\n\\[ 20 \\times 15 \\times 13 \\times 8 \\]\n\nNext, we need to count the number of successful outcomes where the sum is 22 or higher. We can do this by iterating over all possible combinations of dice rolls and counting those that meet the criteria.\n\nLet's calculate this.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Number of sides on each die\nsides = [20, 15, 13, 8]\n\n# Total number of possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 1\nfor side in sides:\n    total_outcomes *= side\n\n# Count successful outcomes where the sum is 22 or higher\nsuccessful_outcomes = 0\n\n# Iterate over all possible combinations of dice rolls\nfor roll in product(*(range(1, side + 1) for side in sides)):\n    if sum(roll) >= 22:\n        successful_outcomes += 1\n\n# Calculate the probability as a reduced fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability = Fraction(successful_outcomes, total_outcomes)\n\nprobability\nassistant > The probability of rolling a total of 22 or higher with the given dice is \\(\\frac{5203}{6240}\\).\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<5203/6240>>>"
