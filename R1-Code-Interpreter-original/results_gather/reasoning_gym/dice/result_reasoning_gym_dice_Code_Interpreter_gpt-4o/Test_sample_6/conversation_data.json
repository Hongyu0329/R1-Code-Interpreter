    "\nassistant > To find the probability of rolling a total of 23 or higher with the given dice, we need to consider all possible outcomes and count the number of successful outcomes that result in a sum of 23 or more.\n\nThe dice you have are:\n- 1d20: A 20-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 20.\n- 1d15: Two 15-sided dice, each with outcomes from 1 to 15.\n- 1d5: A 5-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 5.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of possible outcomes by multiplying the number of sides on each die:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total outcomes} = 20 \\times 15 \\times 15 \\times 5\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the number of successful outcomes where the sum of the dice is 23 or higher.
