    "\nassistant > To find the probability of rolling a total of 15 or higher with the given dice (1d20, 1d7, 1d5, 1d3), we need to consider all possible outcomes and count the number of successful outcomes where the sum is 15 or more.\n\n1. **1d20**: This die has 20 sides, with outcomes ranging from 1 to 20.\n2. **1d7**: This die has 7 sides, with outcomes ranging from 1 to 7.\n3. **1d5**: This die has 5 sides, with outcomes ranging from 1 to 5.\n4. **1d3**: This die has 3 sides, with outcomes ranging from 1 to 3.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total outcomes} = 20 \\times 7 \\times 5 \\times 3 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of successful outcomes where the sum of the dice is 15 or higher.
