    "\nassistant > To find the probability of rolling a total of 26 or higher with the given dice, we need to consider all possible outcomes and count the number of successful outcomes that result in a sum of 26 or more.\n\nThe dice are:\n- 1d20: A 20-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 20.\n- 1d16: Two 16-sided dice, each with outcomes from 1 to 16.\n- 1d15: A 15-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 15.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of possible outcomes by multiplying the number of sides on each die:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total outcomes} = 20 \\times 16 \\times 16 \\times 15\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to count the number of successful outcomes where the sum of the dice is 26 or higher. We will iterate over all possible combinations of dice rolls and count those that meet the criteria.\n\nFinally, the probability is the ratio of successful outcomes to the total number of outcomes, which we will express as a reduced fraction.\n\nLet's perform these calculations.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import product\nfrom math import gcd\n\n# Define the number of sides for each die\nsides = [20, 16, 16, 15]\n\n# Calculate the total number of possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 1\nfor side in sides:\n    total_outcomes *= side\n\n# Count the number of successful outcomes (sum >= 26)\nsuccessful_outcomes = 0\nfor roll in product(range(1, sides[0] + 1), range(1, sides[1] + 1), range(1, sides[2] + 1), range(1, sides[3] + 1)):\n    if sum(roll) >= 26:\n        successful_outcomes += 1\n\n# Calculate the probability as a reduced fraction\nnumerator = successful_outcomes\ndenominator = total_outcomes\ncommon_divisor = gcd(numerator, denominator)\n\nreduced_numerator = numerator // common_divisor\nreduced_denominator = denominator // common_divisor\n\nreduced_fraction = (reduced_numerator, reduced_denominator)\nreduced_fraction\nassistant > The probability of rolling a total of 26 or higher with the given dice is \\(\\frac{21539}{25600}\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<21539/25600>>>"
