    "\nassistant > To find the probability of rolling a total of 20 or higher with the given dice (1d20, 1d14, 1d10, 1d8), we need to consider all possible outcomes and count the number of successful outcomes where the sum is 20 or more.\n\n1. **Total Possible Outcomes**: \n   - For 1d20, there are 20 possible outcomes.\n   - For 1d14, there are 14 possible outcomes.\n   - For 1d10, there are 10 possible outcomes.\n   - For 1d8, there are 8 possible outcomes.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the individual outcomes:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Outcomes} = 20 \\times 14 \\times 10 \\times 8 \\]\n\n2. **Successful Outcomes**:\n   - We need to count the number of combinations where the sum of the dice is 20 or more.\n\nLet's calculate these values.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the number of sides for each die\nsides = [20, 14, 10, 8]\n\n# Calculate total possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 1\nfor side in sides:\n    total_outcomes *= side\n\n# Generate all possible outcomes\nall_rolls = product(*(range(1, side + 1) for side in sides))\n\n# Count successful outcomes where the sum is 20 or more\nsuccessful_outcomes = sum(1 for roll in all_rolls if sum(roll) >= 20)\n\n# Calculate the probability as a reduced fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability = Fraction(successful_outcomes, total_outcomes)\n\ntotal_outcomes, successful_outcomes, probability\nassistant > The total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is 22,400.
