    "\nassistant > To find the probability of rolling a total of 23 or higher with the given dice, we need to consider all possible outcomes and count the favorable ones.\n\nThe dice are:\n- 1d20: A 20-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 20.\n- 1d11: An 11-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 11.\n- 1d6: A 6-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 6.\n- 1d3: A 3-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 3.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n\\[ 20 \\times 11 \\times 6 \\times 3 \\]\n\nWe need to find the number of outcomes where the sum of the dice is 23 or higher.
