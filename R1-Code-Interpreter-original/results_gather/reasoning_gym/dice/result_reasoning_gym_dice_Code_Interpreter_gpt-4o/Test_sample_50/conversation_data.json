    "\nassistant > To find the probability of rolling a total of 32 or higher with the given dice, we need to consider the possible outcomes for each die and calculate the number of favorable outcomes.\n\nThe dice are:\n- 1d20: A 20-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 20.\n- 1d18: An 18-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 18.\n- 1d17: A 17-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 17.\n- 1d6: A 6-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 6.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total outcomes} = 20 \\times 18 \\times 17 \\times 6 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of favorable outcomes where the sum of the dice is 32 or higher. We will iterate over all possible outcomes and count those that meet the criteria. Finally, we will express the probability as a reduced fraction.\n\nLet's perform these calculations.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import product\nfrom math import gcd\n\n# Number of sides on each die\nsides = [20, 18, 17, 6]\n\n# Total number of possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 1\nfor side in sides:\n    total_outcomes *= side\n\n# Calculate the number of favorable outcomes\nfavorable_outcomes = 0\n\n# Iterate over all possible outcomes\nfor outcome in product(range(1, 21), range(1, 19), range(1, 18), range(1, 7)):\n    if sum(outcome) >= 32:\n        favorable_outcomes += 1\n\n# Calculate the probability as a fraction\nnumerator = favorable_outcomes\ndenominator = total_outcomes\n\n# Reduce the fraction\ncommon_divisor = gcd(numerator, denominator)\nreduced_numerator = numerator // common_divisor\nreduced_denominator = denominator // common_divisor\n\nreduced_fraction = (reduced_numerator, reduced_denominator)\nreduced_fraction\nassistant > The probability of rolling a total of 32 or higher with the given dice is \\(\\frac{19841}{36720}\\).\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<19841/36720>>>"
