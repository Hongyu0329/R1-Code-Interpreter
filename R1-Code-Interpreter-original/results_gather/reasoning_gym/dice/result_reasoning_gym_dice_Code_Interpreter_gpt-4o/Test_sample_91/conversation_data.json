    "\nassistant > To find the probability of rolling a total of 21 or higher with the given dice (1d20, 1d10, 1d4, 1d3), we need to consider the possible outcomes for each die and calculate the total number of successful outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes.\n\n1. **1d20**: This die can roll any integer from 1 to 20.\n2. **1d10**: This die can roll any integer from 1 to 10.\n3. **1d4**: This die can roll any integer from 1 to 4.\n4. **1d3**: This die can roll any integer from 1 to 3.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total outcomes} = 20 \\times 10 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of successful outcomes where the sum of the dice is 21 or higher. We'll iterate over all possible combinations of dice rolls and count the successful ones. Let's perform these calculations.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the number of sides for each die\nsides = [20, 10, 4, 3]\n\n# Calculate the total number of possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 1\nfor side in sides:\n    total_outcomes *= side\n\n# Calculate the number of successful outcomes\nsuccessful_outcomes = 0\n\n# Iterate over all possible combinations of dice rolls\nfor roll in product(range(1, 21), range(1, 11), range(1, 5), range(1, 4)):\n    if sum(roll) >= 21:\n        successful_outcomes += 1\n\n# Calculate the probability as a reduced fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability = Fraction(successful_outcomes, total_outcomes)\n\nprobability\nassistant > The probability of rolling a total of 21 or higher with the given dice is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nThus, the answer is <<<1/2>>>."
