    "\nassistant > To find the probability of rolling 18 or higher with the given dice (1d20, 1d10, 1d5, 1d2), we need to consider the possible outcomes for each die and calculate the total number of successful outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes.\n\n1. **Total Possible Outcomes:**\n   - 1d20: 20 possible outcomes (1 to 20)\n   - 1d10: 10 possible outcomes (1 to 10)\n   - 1d5: 5 possible outcomes (1 to 5)\n   - 1d2: 2 possible outcomes (1 to 2)\n\n   Total possible outcomes = \\(20 \\times 10 \\times 5 \\times 2 = 2000\\).\n\n2. **Successful Outcomes (rolling 18 or higher):**\n   We need to find combinations where the sum of the dice is 18 or more. Let's calculate this by iterating over all possible outcomes and counting the successful ones.\n\nLet's perform the calculation.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the possible outcomes for each die\nd20 = range(1, 21)\nd10 = range(1, 11)\nd5 = range(1, 6)\nd2 = range(1, 3)\n\n# Total possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = len(d20) * len(d10) * len(d5) * len(d2)\n\n# Count successful outcomes where the sum is 18 or higher\nsuccessful_outcomes = sum(1 for outcome in product(d20, d10, d5, d2) if sum(outcome) >= 18)\n\n# Calculate the probability as a reduced fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability = Fraction(successful_outcomes, total_outcomes)\n\nprobability\nassistant > The probability of rolling a total of 18 or higher with the given dice is \\(\\frac{13}{20}\\).\n\n<<<13/20>>>"
