    "\nassistant > To find the probability of rolling a total of 27 or higher with the dice 1d20, 1d17, 1d12, and 1d8, we need to consider all possible outcomes and count the number of successful outcomes that result in a sum of 27 or more.\n\n1. **Total Possible Outcomes**: The total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n   \\[\n   20 \\times 17 \\times 12 \\times 8\n   \\]\n\n2. **Successful Outcomes**: We need to count the number of outcomes where the sum of the dice is 27 or more.\n\nLet's calculate these values.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Total possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 20 * 17 * 12 * 8\ntotal_outcomes\nassistant > The total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is 32,640.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of successful outcomes where the sum of the dice is 27 or more. We will iterate over all possible combinations of dice rolls and count those that meet the criteria.# Calculate the number of successful outcomes\nsuccessful_outcomes = 0\n\n# Iterate over all possible outcomes\nfor d20 in range(1, 21):\n    for d17 in range(1, 18):\n        for d12 in range(1, 13):\n            for d8 in range(1, 9):\n                if d20 + d17 + d12 + d8 >= 27:\n                    successful_outcomes += 1\n\nsuccessful_outcomes\nassistant > There are 21,877 successful outcomes where the sum of the dice is 27 or more.\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability of rolling a total of 27 or higher by dividing the number of successful outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. We will then reduce this fraction to its simplest form.from fractions import Fraction\n\n# Calculate the probability as a reduced fraction\nprobability = Fraction(successful_outcomes, total_outcomes)\nprobability\nassistant > The probability of rolling a total of 27 or higher with the dice 1d20, 1d17, 1d12, and 1d8 is \\(\\frac{21877}{32640}\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<}\\frac{21877}{32640}\\text{>>>}\n\\]"
