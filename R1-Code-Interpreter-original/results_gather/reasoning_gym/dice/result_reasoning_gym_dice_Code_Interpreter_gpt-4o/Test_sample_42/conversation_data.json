    "\nassistant > To find the probability of rolling a total of 24 or higher with the given dice (1d20, 1d18, 1d12, 1d5), we need to consider all possible outcomes and count the number of successful outcomes that result in a sum of 24 or more.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of possible outcomes. Each die has a certain number of sides, so the total number of outcomes is the product of the number of sides of all the dice:\n\n- 1d20: 20 sides\n- 1d18: 18 sides\n- 1d12: 12 sides\n- 1d5: 5 sides\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is:\n\n\\[ 20 \\times 18 \\times 12 \\times 5 \\]\n\nNext, we need to count the number of successful outcomes where the sum of the dice is 24 or higher. We will iterate over all possible combinations of dice rolls and count those that meet the criteria.\n\nLet's perform these calculations.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Number of sides on each die\nsides = [20, 18, 12, 5]\n\n# Total number of possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 1\nfor side in sides:\n    total_outcomes *= side\n\n# Count successful outcomes where the sum is 24 or higher\nsuccessful_outcomes = 0\n\n# Iterate over all possible combinations of dice rolls\nfor roll in product(range(1, sides[0] + 1), range(1, sides[1] + 1), range(1, sides[2] + 1), range(1, sides[3] + 1)):\n    if sum(roll) >= 24:\n        successful_outcomes += 1\n\n# Calculate the probability as a reduced fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability = Fraction(successful_outcomes, total_outcomes)\n\nprobability\nassistant > The probability of rolling a total of 24 or higher with the given dice is \\(\\frac{215}{288}\\).\n\nThe final answer is: <<<215/288>>>."
