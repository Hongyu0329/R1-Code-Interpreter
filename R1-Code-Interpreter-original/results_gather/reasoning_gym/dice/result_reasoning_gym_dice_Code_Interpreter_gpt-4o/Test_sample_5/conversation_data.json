    "\nassistant > To find the probability of rolling a total of 27 or higher with the given dice (1d20, 1d18, 1d4, 1d3), we need to consider the possible outcomes for each die and calculate the number of favorable outcomes.\n\n1. **1d20**: This die can roll any integer from 1 to 20.\n2. **1d18**: This die can roll any integer from 1 to 18.\n3. **1d4**: This die can roll any integer from 1 to 4.\n4. **1d3**: This die can roll any integer from 1 to 3.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total outcomes} = 20 \\times 18 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of favorable outcomes where the sum of the dice is 27 or higher.
