    "\nassistant > To find the probability of rolling a total of 24 or higher with the given dice, we need to consider all possible outcomes and count the favorable ones. The dice are:\n\n- 1d20: A 20-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 20.\n- 1d11: An 11-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 11.\n- 1d9: A 9-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 9.\n- 1d9: Another 9-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 9.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n\n\\[ 20 \\times 11 \\times 9 \\times 9 \\]\n\nWe need to calculate the number of outcomes where the sum of the dice is 24 or higher.
