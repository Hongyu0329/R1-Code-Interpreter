    "\nassistant > To find the probability of rolling a total of 23 or higher with the given dice (1d20, 1d9, 1d7, 1d4), we need to consider all possible outcomes and count the number of successful outcomes that result in a sum of 23 or more.\n\n1. **Total Possible Outcomes**: The total number of possible outcomes is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Outcomes} = 20 \\times 9 \\times 7 \\times 4\n   \\]\n\n2. **Successful Outcomes**: We need to count the number of outcomes where the sum of the dice is 23 or more.
