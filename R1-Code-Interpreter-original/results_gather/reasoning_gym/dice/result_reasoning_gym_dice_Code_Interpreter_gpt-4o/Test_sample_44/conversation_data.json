    "\nassistant > To find the probability of rolling a total of 29 or higher with the dice 1d20, 1d16, 1d14, and 1d13, we need to consider the possible outcomes for each die and calculate the total number of successful outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes.\n\n1. **Total Possible Outcomes**: \n   - For 1d20, there are 20 possible outcomes.\n   - For 1d16, there are 16 possible outcomes.\n   - For 1d14, there are 14 possible outcomes.\n   - For 1d13, there are 13 possible outcomes.\n   \n   The total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the individual outcomes:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Possible Outcomes} = 20 \\times 16 \\times 14 \\times 13\n   \\]\n\n2. **Successful Outcomes**:\n   - We need to count the number of outcomes where the sum of the dice is 29 or higher.\n\nLet's calculate these values.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the number of sides for each die\nsides = [20, 16, 14, 13]\n\n# Calculate total possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 1\nfor side in sides:\n    total_outcomes *= side\n\n# Generate all possible outcomes\noutcomes = product(*(range(1, side + 1) for side in sides))\n\n# Count successful outcomes where the sum is 29 or higher\nsuccessful_outcomes = sum(1 for outcome in outcomes if sum(outcome) >= 29)\n\n# Calculate the probability as a reduced fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability = Fraction(successful_outcomes, total_outcomes)\n\ntotal_outcomes, successful_outcomes, probability\nassistant > The total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is 58,240. The number of successful outcomes where the sum is 29 or higher is 40,696. Therefore, the probability of rolling a total of 29 or higher is given by the reduced fraction:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{5087}{7280}\n\\]\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{<<<5087/7280>>>}}\n\\]"
