    "\nassistant > To find the probability of rolling a total of 34 or higher with the given dice (1d20, 1d18, 1d14, 1d9), we need to consider the possible outcomes for each die and calculate the number of successful outcomes that result in a sum of 34 or more.\n\n1. **Total Possible Outcomes**: \n   - For 1d20: 20 possible outcomes (1 to 20)\n   - For 1d18: 18 possible outcomes (1 to 18)\n   - For 1d14: 14 possible outcomes (1 to 14)\n   - For 1d9: 9 possible outcomes (1 to 9)\n\n   The total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the individual outcomes:\n   \\[\n   20 \\times 18 \\times 14 \\times 9\n   \\]\n\n2. **Successful Outcomes**:\n   - We need to find the number of combinations where the sum of the dice is 34 or more.\n\nLet's calculate the total number of possible outcomes and then determine the number of successful outcomes.
