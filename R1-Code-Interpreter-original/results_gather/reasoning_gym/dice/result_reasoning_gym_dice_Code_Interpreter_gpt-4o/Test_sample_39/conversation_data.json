    "\nassistant > To find the probability of rolling a total of 28 or higher with the given dice (1d20, 1d18, 1d12, 1d2), we need to consider all possible outcomes and count the number of successful outcomes that result in a sum of 28 or more.\n\n1. **1d20**: This die can roll any integer from 1 to 20.\n2. **1d18**: This die can roll any integer from 1 to 18.\n3. **1d12**: This die can roll any integer from 1 to 12.\n4. **1d2**: This die can roll either 1 or 2.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total outcomes} = 20 \\times 18 \\times 12 \\times 2 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of successful outcomes where the sum of the dice is 28 or more.
