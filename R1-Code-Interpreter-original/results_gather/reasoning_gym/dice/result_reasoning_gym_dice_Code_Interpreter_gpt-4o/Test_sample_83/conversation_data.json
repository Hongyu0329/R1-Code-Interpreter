    "\nassistant > To find the probability of rolling a total of 25 or higher with the given dice (1d20, 1d11, 1d8, 1d5), we need to consider all possible outcomes and count the number of successful outcomes that result in a sum of 25 or more.\n\n1. **1d20**: This die can roll any integer from 1 to 20.\n2. **1d11**: This die can roll any integer from 1 to 11.\n3. **1d8**: This die can roll any integer from 1 to 8.\n4. **1d5**: This die can roll any integer from 1 to 5.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total outcomes} = 20 \\times 11 \\times 8 \\times 5 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of successful outcomes where the sum of the dice is 25 or more.
