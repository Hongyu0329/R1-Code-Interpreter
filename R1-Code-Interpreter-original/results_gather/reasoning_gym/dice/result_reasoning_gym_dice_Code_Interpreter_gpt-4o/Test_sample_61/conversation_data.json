    "\nassistant > To find the probability of rolling a total of 23 or higher with the given dice, we need to consider all possible outcomes and count the favorable ones. The dice you have are:\n\n- 1d20: A 20-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 20.\n- 1d17: A 17-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 17.\n- 1d13: A 13-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 13.\n- 1d5: A 5-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 5.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total outcomes} = 20 \\times 17 \\times 13 \\times 5 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of favorable outcomes where the sum of the dice is 23 or higher. We will iterate over all possible outcomes and count those that meet the criteria.\n\nLet's calculate this.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the number of sides for each die\nsides = [20, 17, 13, 5]\n\n# Calculate the total number of outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 1\nfor side in sides:\n    total_outcomes *= side\n\n# Generate all possible outcomes\noutcomes = product(*(range(1, side + 1) for side in sides))\n\n# Count the number of favorable outcomes\nfavorable_outcomes = sum(1 for outcome in outcomes if sum(outcome) >= 23)\n\n# Calculate the probability as a reduced fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability = Fraction(favorable_outcomes, total_outcomes)\n\nprobability\nassistant > The probability of rolling a total of 23 or higher with the given dice is \\(\\frac{3459}{4420}\\).\n\nThe final answer is <<<3459/4420>>>."
