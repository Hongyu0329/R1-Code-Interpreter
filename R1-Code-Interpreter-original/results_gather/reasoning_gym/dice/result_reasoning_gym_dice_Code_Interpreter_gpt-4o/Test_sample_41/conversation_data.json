    "\nassistant > To find the probability of rolling a total of 35 or higher with the given dice, we need to consider the possible outcomes for each die and calculate the total number of successful outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nThe dice are:\n- 1d20: 20-sided die\n- 1d18: 18-sided die\n- 1d10: 10-sided die\n- 1d5: 5-sided die\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of possible outcomes. This is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total outcomes} = 20 \\times 18 \\times 10 \\times 5\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the number of successful outcomes where the sum of the dice is 35 or higher.
