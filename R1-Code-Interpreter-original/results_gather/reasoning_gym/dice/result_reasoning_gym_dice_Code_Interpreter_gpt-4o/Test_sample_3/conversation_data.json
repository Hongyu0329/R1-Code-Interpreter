    "\nassistant > To find the probability of rolling a total of 31 or higher with the given dice (1d20, 1d19, 1d12, 1d6), we need to consider the possible outcomes for each die and calculate the total number of successful outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes.\n\n1. **Total Possible Outcomes**: \n   - 1d20 has 20 possible outcomes.\n   - 1d19 has 19 possible outcomes.\n   - 1d12 has 12 possible outcomes.\n   - 1d6 has 6 possible outcomes.\n   \n   Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes when all dice are rolled is:\n   \\[\n   20 \\times 19 \\times 12 \\times 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Successful Outcomes**:\n   - We need to find the number of combinations where the sum of the dice is 31 or higher.\n\nLet's calculate these values.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the number of sides for each die\nsides = [20, 19, 12, 6]\n\n# Calculate total possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 1\nfor side in sides:\n    total_outcomes *= side\n\n# Generate all possible outcomes\noutcomes = product(range(1, sides[0] + 1), range(1, sides[1] + 1), range(1, sides[2] + 1), range(1, sides[3] + 1))\n\n# Count successful outcomes where the sum is 31 or higher\nsuccessful_outcomes = sum(1 for outcome in outcomes if sum(outcome) >= 31)\n\n# Calculate the probability as a reduced fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability = Fraction(successful_outcomes, total_outcomes).limit_denominator()\n\nprobability\nassistant > The probability of rolling a total of 31 or higher with the given dice is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nThe final answer is <<<1/2>>>."
