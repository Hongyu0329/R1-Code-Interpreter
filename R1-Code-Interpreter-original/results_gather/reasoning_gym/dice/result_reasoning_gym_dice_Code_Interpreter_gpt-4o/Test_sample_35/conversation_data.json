    "\nassistant > To find the probability of rolling a total of 24 or higher with the given dice, we need to consider the possible outcomes for each die and calculate the total number of successful outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nThe dice you have are:\n- 1d20: A 20-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 20.\n- 1d15: A 15-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 15.\n- 1d5: A 5-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 5.\n- 1d4: A 4-sided die with outcomes from 1 to 4.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n\\[ 20 \\times 15 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of successful outcomes where the sum of the dice is 24 or higher.
