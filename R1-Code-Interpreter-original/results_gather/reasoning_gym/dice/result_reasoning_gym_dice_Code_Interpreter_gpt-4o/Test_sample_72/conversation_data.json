    "\nassistant > To find the probability of rolling a total of 21 or higher with the given dice (1d20, 1d9, 1d8, 1d2), we need to consider all possible outcomes and count the number of successful outcomes that result in a sum of 21 or more.\n\n1. **Total Possible Outcomes**: \n   - 1d20 has 20 possible outcomes (1 to 20).\n   - 1d9 has 9 possible outcomes (1 to 9).\n   - 1d8 has 8 possible outcomes (1 to 8).\n   - 1d2 has 2 possible outcomes (1 to 2).\n\n   The total number of possible outcomes when all dice are rolled is the product of the number of outcomes for each die:\n   \\[\n   20 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Successful Outcomes**:\n   - We need to count the number of combinations where the sum of the dice is 21 or more.\n\nLet's calculate these values.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the number of sides for each die\nsides = [20, 9, 8, 2]\n\n# Calculate total possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 1\nfor side in sides:\n    total_outcomes *= side\n\n# Generate all possible outcomes\nall_outcomes = product(range(1, 21), range(1, 10), range(1, 9), range(1, 3))\n\n# Count successful outcomes where the sum is 21 or more\nsuccessful_outcomes = sum(1 for outcome in all_outcomes if sum(outcome) >= 21)\n\n# Calculate the probability as a reduced fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability = Fraction(successful_outcomes, total_outcomes)\n\ntotal_outcomes, successful_outcomes, probability\nassistant > The total number of possible outcomes when all dice are rolled is 2880. Out of these, 1584 outcomes result in a sum of 21 or higher.
