    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a total of 24 or higher using the given dice: 1d20, 1d19, 1d10, and 1d2. \n\nFirst, let's determine the total number of possible outcomes. Each die has a certain number of sides, and each side represents a possible outcome. The total number of outcomes when rolling all the dice is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n\n- 1d20 has 20 sides.\n- 1d19 has 19 sides.\n- 1d10 has 10 sides.\n- 1d2 has 2 sides.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is:\n\\[ 20 \\times 19 \\times 10 \\times 2 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of favorable outcomes where the sum of the dice is 24 or higher. This involves iterating over all possible combinations of dice rolls and counting those that meet the criteria.\n\nLet's write a Python script to calculate the number of favorable outcomes and the total number of outcomes, and then compute the probability as a reduced fraction.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Define the number of sides for each die\nsides = [20, 19, 10, 2]\n\n# Calculate the total number of possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 1\nfor side in sides:\n    total_outcomes *= side\n\n# Initialize the count of favorable outcomes\nfavorable_outcomes = 0\n\n# Iterate over all possible outcomes\nfor d20 in range(1, 21):\n    for d19 in range(1, 20):\n        for d10 in range(1, 11):\n            for d2 in range(1, 3):\n                if d20 + d19 + d10 + d2 >= 24:\n                    favorable_outcomes += 1\n\n# Calculate the probability as a reduced fraction\nprobability = Fraction(favorable_outcomes, total_outcomes)\n\n# Print the probability\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the probability of rolling a total of 24 or higher and output it as a reduced fraction. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
