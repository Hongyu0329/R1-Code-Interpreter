    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a total of 27 or higher with the given dice: 1d20, 1d16, 1d16, and 1d6. \n\nFirst, let's understand the possible outcomes for each die:\n- 1d20: This die can roll any integer from 1 to 20.\n- 1d16: Each of these dice can roll any integer from 1 to 16.\n- 1d6: This die can roll any integer from 1 to 6.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of outcomes for each die:\n\\[ 20 \\times 16 \\times 16 \\times 6 \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of favorable outcomes where the sum of the dice is 27 or higher. This involves iterating over all possible combinations of rolls and counting those that meet the criteria.\n\nLet's write a Python script to calculate this:\n\n```python\n# Define the range of each die\nd20_range = range(1, 21)\nd16_range = range(1, 17)\nd6_range = range(1, 7)\n\n# Initialize the count of favorable outcomes\nfavorable_outcomes = 0\n\n# Iterate over all possible outcomes\nfor d20 in d20_range:\n    for d16_1 in d16_range:\n        for d16_2 in d16_range:\n            for d6 in d6_range:\n                if d20 + d16_1 + d16_2 + d6 >= 27:\n                    favorable_outcomes += 1\n\n# Calculate the total number of possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 20 * 16 * 16 * 6\n\n# Calculate the probability as a fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability = Fraction(favorable_outcomes, total_outcomes)\n\n# Print the reduced fraction\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nThis script will iterate over all possible combinations of dice rolls, count the number of combinations that result in a sum of 27 or higher, and then calculate the probability as a reduced fraction. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
