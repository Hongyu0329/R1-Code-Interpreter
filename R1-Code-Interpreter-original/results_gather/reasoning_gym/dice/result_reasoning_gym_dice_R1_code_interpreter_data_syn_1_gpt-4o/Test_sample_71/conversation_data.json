    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a total of 21 or higher using the given dice: 1d20, 1d16, 1d8, and 1d4. \n\nFirst, let's understand the possible outcomes for each die:\n- 1d20: 20 possible outcomes (1 to 20)\n- 1d16: 16 possible outcomes (1 to 16)\n- 1d8: 8 possible outcomes (1 to 8)\n- 1d4: 4 possible outcomes (1 to 4)\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of outcomes for each die:\n\\[ \\text{Total outcomes} = 20 \\times 16 \\times 8 \\times 4 \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of favorable outcomes where the sum of the dice is 21 or higher. This involves iterating over all possible combinations of dice rolls and counting those that meet the criteria.\n\nLet's write a Python script to calculate this:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of sides for each die\nsides_d20 = 20\nsides_d16 = 16\nsides_d8 = 8\nsides_d4 = 4\n\n# Initialize the count of favorable outcomes\nfavorable_outcomes = 0\n\n# Iterate over all possible outcomes\nfor d20 in range(1, sides_d20 + 1):\n    for d16 in range(1, sides_d16 + 1):\n        for d8 in range(1, sides_d8 + 1):\n            for d4 in range(1, sides_d4 + 1):\n                # Calculate the sum of the current combination\n                total = d20 + d16 + d8 + d4\n                # Check if the sum is 21 or higher\n                if total >= 21:\n                    favorable_outcomes += 1\n\n# Calculate the total number of possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = sides_d20 * sides_d16 * sides_d8 * sides_d4\n\n# Calculate the probability as a fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability = Fraction(favorable_outcomes, total_outcomes)\n\n# Print the reduced fraction\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nThis script will calculate the probability of rolling a total of 21 or higher and output it as a reduced fraction. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
