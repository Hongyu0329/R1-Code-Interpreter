    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a total of 21 or higher using the given dice: 1d20, 1d10, 1d4, and 1d3. \n\nFirst, let's determine the possible outcomes for each die:\n- 1d20: Possible outcomes are 1 through 20.\n- 1d10: Possible outcomes are 1 through 10.\n- 1d4: Possible outcomes are 1 through 4.\n- 1d3: Possible outcomes are 1 through 3.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of outcomes for each die:\n\\[ 20 \\times 10 \\times 4 \\times 3 = 2400 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the number of favorable outcomes where the sum of the dice is 21 or higher. We can do this by iterating over all possible combinations of dice rolls and counting those that meet the criteria.\n\nLet's write a Python script to calculate this:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the possible outcomes for each die\nd20 = range(1, 21)\nd10 = range(1, 11)\nd4 = range(1, 5)\nd3 = range(1, 4)\n\n# Total number of possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 20 * 10 * 4 * 3\n\n# Count the number of favorable outcomes\nfavorable_outcomes = 0\n\n# Iterate over all possible combinations of dice rolls\nfor roll in product(d20, d10, d4, d3):\n    if sum(roll) >= 21:\n        favorable_outcomes += 1\n\n# Calculate the probability as a reduced fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability = Fraction(favorable_outcomes, total_outcomes)\n\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nThis script will calculate the number of favorable outcomes and then determine the probability as a reduced fraction. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
    "The code execution indicates that the probability of rolling a total of 21 or higher with the given dice is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1/2>>>"
