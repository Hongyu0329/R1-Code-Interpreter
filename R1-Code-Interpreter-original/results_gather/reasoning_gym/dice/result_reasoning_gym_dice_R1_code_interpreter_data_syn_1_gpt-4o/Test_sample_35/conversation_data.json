    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a total of 24 or higher using the given dice: 1d20, 1d15, 1d5, and 1d4. \n\nFirst, let's determine the total number of possible outcomes. Each die has a certain number of sides, and each side represents a possible outcome. The total number of outcomes when rolling all the dice is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n\n- 1d20 has 20 sides\n- 1d15 has 15 sides\n- 1d5 has 5 sides\n- 1d4 has 4 sides\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is:\n\\[ 20 \\times 15 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of favorable outcomes where the sum of the dice is 24 or higher. We can do this by iterating over all possible combinations of dice rolls and counting those that meet the criteria.\n\nLet's write a Python script to calculate this:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of sides for each die\nsides_d20 = 20\nsides_d15 = 15\nsides_d5 = 5\nsides_d4 = 4\n\n# Initialize the count of favorable outcomes\nfavorable_outcomes = 0\n\n# Iterate over all possible outcomes\nfor d20 in range(1, sides_d20 + 1):\n    for d15 in range(1, sides_d15 + 1):\n        for d5 in range(1, sides_d5 + 1):\n            for d4 in range(1, sides_d4 + 1):\n                if d20 + d15 + d5 + d4 >= 24:\n                    favorable_outcomes += 1\n\n# Calculate the total number of possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = sides_d20 * sides_d15 * sides_d5 * sides_d4\n\n# Calculate the probability as a fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability = Fraction(favorable_outcomes, total_outcomes)\n\n# Print the reduced fraction\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nThis script will calculate the number of favorable outcomes and the total number of outcomes, then compute the probability as a reduced fraction. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
