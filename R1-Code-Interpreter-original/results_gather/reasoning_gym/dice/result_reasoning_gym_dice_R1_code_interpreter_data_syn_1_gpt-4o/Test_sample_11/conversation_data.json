    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a total of 23 or higher using the given dice: 1d20, 1d11, 1d6, and 1d3. \n\nFirst, let's understand the possible outcomes for each die:\n- 1d20: Can roll any integer from 1 to 20.\n- 1d11: Can roll any integer from 1 to 11.\n- 1d6: Can roll any integer from 1 to 6.\n- 1d3: Can roll any integer from 1 to 3.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n\\[ 20 \\times 11 \\times 6 \\times 3 = 3960 \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of favorable outcomes where the sum of the dice is 23 or higher. This involves iterating over all possible combinations of rolls and counting those that meet the criteria.\n\nLet's write a Python script to calculate this:\n\n```python\n# Initialize the count of favorable outcomes\nfavorable_outcomes = 0\n\n# Iterate over all possible outcomes\nfor d20 in range(1, 21):\n    for d11 in range(1, 12):\n        for d6 in range(1, 7):\n            for d3 in range(1, 4):\n                if d20 + d11 + d6 + d3 >= 23:\n                    favorable_outcomes += 1\n\n# Total possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 20 * 11 * 6 * 3\n\n# Calculate the probability as a fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability = Fraction(favorable_outcomes, total_outcomes)\n\n# Print the reduced fraction\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the number of favorable outcomes and then determine the probability as a reduced fraction. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the probability of rolling a total of 23 or higher with the given dice as a reduced fraction. \n\nThe probability is \\( \\frac{19}{40} \\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<19/40>>>"
