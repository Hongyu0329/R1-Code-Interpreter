    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a total of 21 or higher when rolling one 20-sided die (1d20), one 10-sided die (1d10), one 6-sided die (1d6), and one 4-sided die (1d4).\n\nFirst, let's determine the total number of possible outcomes. Each die has a certain number of sides, and since they are rolled independently, the total number of outcomes is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n\n- 1d20 has 20 possible outcomes.\n- 1d10 has 10 possible outcomes.\n- 1d6 has 6 possible outcomes.\n- 1d4 has 4 possible outcomes.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is:\n\\[ 20 \\times 10 \\times 6 \\times 4 = 4800 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of favorable outcomes, i.e., the number of ways to roll a total of 21 or higher. We can do this by iterating over all possible combinations of rolls and counting those that sum to 21 or more.\n\nLet's write a Python script to calculate this:\n\n```python\n# Initialize the count of favorable outcomes\nfavorable_outcomes = 0\n\n# Iterate over all possible outcomes\nfor d20 in range(1, 21):\n    for d10 in range(1, 11):\n        for d6 in range(1, 7):\n            for d4 in range(1, 5):\n                # Calculate the sum of the current combination\n                total = d20 + d10 + d6 + d4\n                # Check if the sum is 21 or higher\n                if total >= 21:\n                    favorable_outcomes += 1\n\n# Calculate the probability as a fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability = Fraction(favorable_outcomes, 4800)\n\n# Print the reduced fraction\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nThis script will iterate over all possible outcomes, count the number of favorable outcomes, and then calculate the probability as a reduced fraction. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the result. The probability of rolling a total of 21 or higher with the given dice is \\( \\frac{23}{40} \\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<23/40>>>"
