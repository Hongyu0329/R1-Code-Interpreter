    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a total of 28 or higher using the given dice: 1d20, 1d12, 1d9, and 1d5. \n\nFirst, let's understand the possible outcomes for each die:\n- 1d20: Can roll any integer from 1 to 20.\n- 1d12: Can roll any integer from 1 to 12.\n- 1d9: Can roll any integer from 1 to 9.\n- 1d5: Can roll any integer from 1 to 5.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n\\[ 20 \\times 12 \\times 9 \\times 5 \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of favorable outcomes where the sum of the dice is 28 or higher. This involves iterating over all possible combinations of dice rolls and counting those that meet the criteria.\n\nLet's write a Python script to calculate this:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of sides for each die\nsides_d20 = 20\nsides_d12 = 12\nsides_d9 = 9\nsides_d5 = 5\n\n# Initialize the count of favorable outcomes\nfavorable_outcomes = 0\n\n# Iterate over all possible outcomes\nfor d20 in range(1, sides_d20 + 1):\n    for d12 in range(1, sides_d12 + 1):\n        for d9 in range(1, sides_d9 + 1):\n            for d5 in range(1, sides_d5 + 1):\n                if d20 + d12 + d9 + d5 >= 28:\n                    favorable_outcomes += 1\n\n# Calculate the total number of possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = sides_d20 * sides_d12 * sides_d9 * sides_d5\n\n# Calculate the probability as a fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability = Fraction(favorable_outcomes, total_outcomes)\n\n# Print the probability as a reduced fraction\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nThis script will iterate over all possible combinations of dice rolls, count the number of combinations that result in a sum of 28 or higher, and then calculate the probability as a reduced fraction. Let's execute this code to find the answer.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the probability of rolling a total of 28 or higher using the given dice as a reduced fraction. The result is \\( \\frac{817}{2160} \\).\n\nThis fraction represents the probability of achieving a sum of 28 or more when rolling one 20-sided die, one 12-sided die, one 9-sided die, and one 5-sided die.\n\n<<<817/2160>>>"
