    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a total of 27 or higher using the given dice: 1d20, 1d18, 1d4, and 1d3. \n\nFirst, let's determine the possible outcomes for each die:\n- 1d20: 20 possible outcomes (1 to 20)\n- 1d18: 18 possible outcomes (1 to 18)\n- 1d4: 4 possible outcomes (1 to 4)\n- 1d3: 3 possible outcomes (1 to 3)\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of outcomes for each die:\n\\[ 20 \\times 18 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the number of favorable outcomes where the sum of the dice is 27 or higher. We can do this by iterating over all possible combinations of dice rolls and counting those that meet the criteria.\n\nLet's write a Python script to calculate this:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of sides for each die\nsides_d20 = 20\nsides_d18 = 18\nsides_d4 = 4\nsides_d3 = 3\n\n# Initialize the count of favorable outcomes\nfavorable_outcomes = 0\n\n# Iterate over all possible outcomes\nfor d20 in range(1, sides_d20 + 1):\n    for d18 in range(1, sides_d18 + 1):\n        for d4 in range(1, sides_d4 + 1):\n            for d3 in range(1, sides_d3 + 1):\n                # Calculate the sum of the dice\n                total = d20 + d18 + d4 + d3\n                # Check if the sum is 27 or higher\n                if total >= 27:\n                    favorable_outcomes += 1\n\n# Calculate the total number of possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = sides_d20 * sides_d18 * sides_d4 * sides_d3\n\n# Calculate the probability as a fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability = Fraction(favorable_outcomes, total_outcomes)\n\n# Print the probability as a reduced fraction\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nThis script will calculate the probability of rolling a total of 27 or higher and output it as a reduced fraction. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the probability of rolling a total of 27 or higher using the given dice as a reduced fraction. \n\nThe probability is \\( \\frac{581}{1440} \\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<581/1440>>>"
