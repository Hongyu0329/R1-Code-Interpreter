    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a total of 24 or higher using the given dice: 1d20, 1d11, 1d9, and 1d9. \n\nFirst, let's understand the possible outcomes for each die:\n- 1d20: Can roll any integer from 1 to 20.\n- 1d11: Can roll any integer from 1 to 11.\n- 1d9: Can roll any integer from 1 to 9.\n- 1d9: Can roll any integer from 1 to 9.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n\\[ 20 \\times 11 \\times 9 \\times 9 = 17820 \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many of these outcomes result in a sum of 24 or higher. This involves iterating over all possible combinations of rolls and counting those that meet the criteria.\n\nLet's write a Python script to calculate this:\n\n```python\ntotal_outcomes = 0\nsuccessful_outcomes = 0\n\n# Iterate over all possible outcomes\nfor d20 in range(1, 21):\n    for d11 in range(1, 12):\n        for d9_1 in range(1, 10):\n            for d9_2 in range(1, 10):\n                total_outcomes += 1\n                if d20 + d11 + d9_1 + d9_2 >= 24:\n                    successful_outcomes += 1\n\n# Calculate the probability as a reduced fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability = Fraction(successful_outcomes, total_outcomes)\n\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nThis script will iterate over all possible outcomes, count the successful ones, and then calculate the probability as a reduced fraction. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
