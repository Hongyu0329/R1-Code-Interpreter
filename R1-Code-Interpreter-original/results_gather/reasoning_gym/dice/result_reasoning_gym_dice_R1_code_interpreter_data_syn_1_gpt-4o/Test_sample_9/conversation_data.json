    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a total of 26 or higher using the given dice: 1d20, 1d14, 1d12, and 1d9. \n\nFirst, let's determine the total number of possible outcomes. Each die has a certain number of sides, and each side represents a possible outcome. Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n\n- 1d20 has 20 sides\n- 1d14 has 14 sides\n- 1d12 has 12 sides\n- 1d9 has 9 sides\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is:\n\\[ 20 \\times 14 \\times 12 \\times 9 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of favorable outcomes, which are the outcomes where the sum of the dice is 26 or higher. This involves iterating over all possible combinations of dice rolls and counting those that meet the criteria.\n\nLet's write a Python script to calculate the number of favorable outcomes and the total number of outcomes, and then compute the probability as a reduced fraction.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Define the number of sides for each die\nsides = [20, 14, 12, 9]\n\n# Calculate the total number of possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 1\nfor side in sides:\n    total_outcomes *= side\n\n# Initialize the count of favorable outcomes\nfavorable_outcomes = 0\n\n# Iterate over all possible outcomes\nfor d20 in range(1, 21):\n    for d14 in range(1, 15):\n        for d12 in range(1, 13):\n            for d9 in range(1, 10):\n                if d20 + d14 + d12 + d9 >= 26:\n                    favorable_outcomes += 1\n\n# Calculate the probability as a reduced fraction\nprobability = Fraction(favorable_outcomes, total_outcomes)\n\n# Print the probability\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nThis script will calculate the probability of rolling a total of 26 or higher with the given dice and output it as a reduced fraction. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output as a reduced fraction. The probability of rolling a total of 26 or higher with the given dice (1d20, 1d14, 1d12, and 1d9) is \\( \\frac{20459}{30240} \\).\n\n<<<20459/30240>>>"
