    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a total of 21 or higher using the given dice: 1d20, 1d10, 1d2, and 1d2. \n\nFirst, let's understand the possible outcomes for each die:\n- 1d20: This die can roll any integer from 1 to 20.\n- 1d10: This die can roll any integer from 1 to 10.\n- 1d2: Each of these dice can roll either 1 or 2.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes when rolling all these dice is the product of the number of outcomes for each die:\n- Total outcomes = 20 (for 1d20) * 10 (for 1d10) * 2 (for 1d2) * 2 (for 1d2) = 800.\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of favorable outcomes where the sum of the dice is 21 or higher. We can do this by iterating over all possible combinations of dice rolls and counting those that meet the criteria.\n\nLet's write a Python script to calculate the number of favorable outcomes and then determine the probability as a reduced fraction.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Initialize the count of favorable outcomes\nfavorable_outcomes = 0\n\n# Iterate over all possible outcomes\nfor d20 in range(1, 21):\n    for d10 in range(1, 11):\n        for d2_1 in range(1, 3):\n            for d2_2 in range(1, 3):\n                total = d20 + d10 + d2_1 + d2_2\n                if total >= 21:\n                    favorable_outcomes += 1\n\n# Total possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 20 * 10 * 2 * 2\n\n# Calculate the probability as a fraction\nprobability = Fraction(favorable_outcomes, total_outcomes)\n\n# Print the reduced fraction\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nThis script will calculate the number of favorable outcomes and the total number of outcomes, then compute the probability as a reduced fraction. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the probability of rolling a total of 21 or higher using the given dice. The probability is represented as a reduced fraction.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<17/40>>>"
