    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a total of 21 or higher using the given dice: 1d20, 1d9, 1d8, and 1d2. \n\nFirst, let's understand the possible outcomes for each die:\n- 1d20: Can roll any integer from 1 to 20.\n- 1d9: Can roll any integer from 1 to 9.\n- 1d8: Can roll any integer from 1 to 8.\n- 1d2: Can roll either 1 or 2.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n\\[ 20 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 2 = 2880 \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many of these outcomes result in a sum of 21 or higher. We can do this by iterating over all possible combinations of rolls and counting those that meet the criteria.\n\nLet's write a Python script to calculate this:\n\n```python\n# Initialize the count of successful outcomes\nsuccessful_outcomes = 0\n\n# Iterate over all possible outcomes\nfor d20 in range(1, 21):\n    for d9 in range(1, 10):\n        for d8 in range(1, 9):\n            for d2 in range(1, 3):\n                # Calculate the sum of the current roll\n                total = d20 + d9 + d8 + d2\n                # Check if the sum is 21 or higher\n                if total >= 21:\n                    successful_outcomes += 1\n\n# Total number of possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 20 * 9 * 8 * 2\n\n# Calculate the probability as a fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability = Fraction(successful_outcomes, total_outcomes)\n\n# Print the reduced fraction\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nThis script will calculate the number of successful outcomes and then determine the probability as a reduced fraction. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the probability of rolling a total of 21 or higher using the given dice as a reduced fraction. \n\nThe probability is \\( \\frac{11}{20} \\).\n\n<<<11/20>>>"
