    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a total of 21 or higher using the given dice: 1d20, 1d7, 1d7, and 1d4. \n\nFirst, let's understand the possible outcomes for each die:\n- 1d20: Can roll any integer from 1 to 20.\n- 1d7: Can roll any integer from 1 to 7.\n- 1d7: Another die that can roll any integer from 1 to 7.\n- 1d4: Can roll any integer from 1 to 4.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of outcomes for each die:\n\\[ 20 \\times 7 \\times 7 \\times 4 = 3920 \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many of these outcomes result in a sum of 21 or higher. This involves iterating over all possible combinations of rolls and counting those that meet the criteria.\n\nLet's write a Python script to calculate this:\n\n```python\n# Initialize the count of successful outcomes\nsuccessful_outcomes = 0\n\n# Iterate over all possible outcomes\nfor d20 in range(1, 21):\n    for d7_1 in range(1, 8):\n        for d7_2 in range(1, 8):\n            for d4 in range(1, 5):\n                # Calculate the sum of the current combination\n                total = d20 + d7_1 + d7_2 + d4\n                # Check if the sum is 21 or higher\n                if total >= 21:\n                    successful_outcomes += 1\n\n# Total number of possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 20 * 7 * 7 * 4\n\n# Calculate the probability as a fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability = Fraction(successful_outcomes, total_outcomes)\n\n# Print the reduced fraction\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nThis script will iterate over all possible outcomes, count those that result in a sum of 21 or higher, and then calculate the probability as a reduced fraction. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the probability of rolling a total of 21 or higher using the given dice. The probability is represented as a reduced fraction.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<21/40>>>"
