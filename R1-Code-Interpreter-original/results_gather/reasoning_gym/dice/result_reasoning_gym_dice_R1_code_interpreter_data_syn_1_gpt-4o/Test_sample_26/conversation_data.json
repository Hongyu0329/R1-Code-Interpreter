    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a total of 17 or higher using the given dice: one 20-sided die (1d20) and three 8-sided dice (3d8). \n\n### Step-by-step Approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Dice Rolls:**\n   - 1d20: This die can roll any integer from 1 to 20.\n   - 3d8: Each of these dice can roll any integer from 1 to 8. Since there are three of them, we need to consider all combinations of their rolls.\n\n2. **Calculate Total Possible Outcomes:**\n   - The total number of outcomes for 1d20 is 20.\n   - The total number of outcomes for 3d8 is \\(8 \\times 8 \\times 8 = 512\\).\n   - Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes when all dice are rolled is \\(20 \\times 512 = 10240\\).\n\n3. **Calculate Favorable Outcomes:**\n   - We need to find the number of outcomes where the sum of the dice is 17 or higher.\n   - We will iterate over all possible outcomes of the dice rolls and count those that meet the criteria.\n\n4. **Compute the Probability:**\n   - The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nLet's write a Python script to calculate the number of favorable outcomes and then determine the probability.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the range of each die\nd20 = range(1, 21)\nd8 = range(1, 9)\n\n# Total number of possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 20 * 8 * 8 * 8\n\n# Count favorable outcomes\nfavorable_outcomes = 0\n\n# Iterate over all possible outcomes\nfor roll in product(d20, d8, d8, d8):\n    if sum(roll) >= 17:\n        favorable_outcomes += 1\n\n# Calculate probability as a reduced fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability = Fraction(favorable_outcomes, total_outcomes)\n\n# Output the probability\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the probability of rolling a total of 17 or higher with the given dice. Let's execute it to find the result.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the probability of rolling a total of 17 or higher using the given dice. The result is a fraction that represents the probability.\n\nThe probability of rolling a total of 17 or higher with one 20-sided die and three 8-sided dice is:\n\n<<<863/1024>>>"
