    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a total of 26 or higher with the given dice: 1d20, 1d11, 1d11, and 1d6. \n\nFirst, let's understand the possible outcomes for each die:\n- 1d20: This die can roll any integer from 1 to 20.\n- 1d11: Each of these dice can roll any integer from 1 to 11.\n- 1d6: This die can roll any integer from 1 to 6.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of outcomes for each die:\n\\[ 20 \\times 11 \\times 11 \\times 6 \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of favorable outcomes where the sum of the dice is 26 or higher. This involves iterating over all possible combinations of dice rolls and counting those that meet the criteria.\n\nTo efficiently compute this, we can use a Python script to iterate over all possible outcomes and count the number of favorable ones.\n\n```python\n# Initialize the count of favorable outcomes\nfavorable_outcomes = 0\n\n# Iterate over all possible outcomes\nfor d20 in range(1, 21):\n    for d11_1 in range(1, 12):\n        for d11_2 in range(1, 12):\n            for d6 in range(1, 7):\n                # Calculate the sum of the current combination\n                total = d20 + d11_1 + d11_2 + d6\n                # Check if the sum is 26 or higher\n                if total >= 26:\n                    favorable_outcomes += 1\n\n# Calculate the total number of possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 20 * 11 * 11 * 6\n\n# Calculate the probability as a fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability = Fraction(favorable_outcomes, total_outcomes)\n\n# Print the reduced fraction\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nThis script will calculate the probability of rolling a total of 26 or higher and output it as a reduced fraction. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
    "The code has successfully calculated the probability of rolling a total of 26 or higher with the given dice. The result is the fraction 7613/14520, which is already in its reduced form.\n\nTherefore, the probability of rolling 26 or higher with the dice 1d20, 1d11, 1d11, and 1d6 is:\n\n<<<7613/14520>>>"
