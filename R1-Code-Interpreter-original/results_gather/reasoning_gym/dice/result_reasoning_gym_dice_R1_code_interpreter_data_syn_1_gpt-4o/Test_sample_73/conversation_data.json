    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a total of 20 or higher using the given dice: 1d20, 1d13, 1d5, and 1d2. \n\nFirst, let's understand the possible outcomes for each die:\n- 1d20: Can roll any integer from 1 to 20.\n- 1d13: Can roll any integer from 1 to 13.\n- 1d5: Can roll any integer from 1 to 5.\n- 1d2: Can roll either 1 or 2.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n\\[ 20 \\times 13 \\times 5 \\times 2 \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of favorable outcomes where the sum of the dice is 20 or higher. This involves iterating over all possible combinations of dice rolls and checking if their sum is 20 or more.\n\nLet's write a Python script to calculate the number of favorable outcomes and the total number of outcomes, and then compute the probability as a reduced fraction.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Total number of outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 20 * 13 * 5 * 2\n\n# Count favorable outcomes\nfavorable_outcomes = 0\n\n# Iterate over all possible outcomes\nfor d20 in range(1, 21):\n    for d13 in range(1, 14):\n        for d5 in range(1, 6):\n            for d2 in range(1, 3):\n                if d20 + d13 + d5 + d2 >= 20:\n                    favorable_outcomes += 1\n\n# Calculate probability as a reduced fraction\nprobability = Fraction(favorable_outcomes, total_outcomes)\n\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the probability of rolling a total of 20 or higher and output it as a reduced fraction.",
