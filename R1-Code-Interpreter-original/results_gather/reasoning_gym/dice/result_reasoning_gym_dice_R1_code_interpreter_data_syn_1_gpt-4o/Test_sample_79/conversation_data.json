    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a total of 27 or higher using the given dice: 1d20, 1d17, 1d12, and 1d8. \n\nFirst, let's understand the problem:\n- 1d20 means a 20-sided die, with possible outcomes from 1 to 20.\n- 1d17 means a 17-sided die, with possible outcomes from 1 to 17.\n- 1d12 means a 12-sided die, with possible outcomes from 1 to 12.\n- 1d8 means an 8-sided die, with possible outcomes from 1 to 8.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n\\[ 20 \\times 17 \\times 12 \\times 8 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the number of favorable outcomes where the sum of the dice is 27 or higher. This involves iterating over all possible combinations of dice rolls and counting those that meet the criteria.\n\nLet's write a Python script to calculate this:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the number of sides for each die\nsides = [20, 17, 12, 8]\n\n# Calculate the total number of possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 1\nfor side in sides:\n    total_outcomes *= side\n\n# Calculate the number of favorable outcomes\nfavorable_outcomes = 0\n\n# Iterate over all possible outcomes\nfor roll in product(range(1, sides[0] + 1), range(1, sides[1] + 1), range(1, sides[2] + 1), range(1, sides[3] + 1)):\n    if sum(roll) >= 27:\n        favorable_outcomes += 1\n\n# Calculate the probability as a reduced fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability = Fraction(favorable_outcomes, total_outcomes)\n\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the probability of rolling a total of 27 or higher and output it as a reduced fraction. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
    "The code has successfully calculated the probability of rolling a total of 27 or higher with the given dice. The result is the fraction \\( \\frac{21877}{32640} \\).\n\nThis fraction represents the probability of achieving a sum of 27 or more when rolling a 20-sided die, a 17-sided die, a 12-sided die, and an 8-sided die simultaneously.\n\n<<<21877/32640>>>"
