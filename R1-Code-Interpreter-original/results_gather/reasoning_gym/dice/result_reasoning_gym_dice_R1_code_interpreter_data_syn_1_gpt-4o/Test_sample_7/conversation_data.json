    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a total of 20 or higher when rolling the given dice: 1d20, 1d14, 1d10, and 1d8. \n\nFirst, let's understand the problem:\n- 1d20 means a single 20-sided die, with possible outcomes from 1 to 20.\n- 1d14 means a single 14-sided die, with possible outcomes from 1 to 14.\n- 1d10 means a single 10-sided die, with possible outcomes from 1 to 10.\n- 1d8 means a single 8-sided die, with possible outcomes from 1 to 8.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes when rolling all these dice is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n\\[ 20 \\times 14 \\times 10 \\times 8 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of favorable outcomes where the sum of the dice is 20 or higher. This involves iterating over all possible combinations of dice rolls and counting those that meet the criteria.\n\nLet's write a Python script to calculate this:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the number of sides for each die\nsides = [20, 14, 10, 8]\n\n# Calculate the total number of possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 1\nfor side in sides:\n    total_outcomes *= side\n\n# Calculate the number of favorable outcomes\nfavorable_outcomes = 0\n\n# Iterate over all possible outcomes\nfor roll in product(range(1, sides[0] + 1), range(1, sides[1] + 1), range(1, sides[2] + 1), range(1, sides[3] + 1)):\n    if sum(roll) >= 20:\n        favorable_outcomes += 1\n\n# Calculate the probability as a reduced fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability = Fraction(favorable_outcomes, total_outcomes)\n\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nThis script will calculate the probability of rolling a total of 20 or higher and output it as a reduced fraction. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
