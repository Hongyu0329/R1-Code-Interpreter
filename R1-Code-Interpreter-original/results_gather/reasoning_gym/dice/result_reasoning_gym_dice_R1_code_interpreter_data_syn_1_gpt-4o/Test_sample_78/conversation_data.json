    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a total of 37 or higher using the given dice: 1d20, 1d15, 1d14, and 1d9. \n\nFirst, let's determine the total number of possible outcomes. Each die has a certain number of sides, and each side represents a possible outcome. Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n\n- 1d20 has 20 sides\n- 1d15 has 15 sides\n- 1d14 has 14 sides\n- 1d9 has 9 sides\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is:\n\\[ 20 \\times 15 \\times 14 \\times 9 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of favorable outcomes, which are the outcomes where the sum of the dice is 37 or higher. To do this, we can iterate over all possible outcomes and count those that meet the criteria.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the number of sides for each die\nsides = [20, 15, 14, 9]\n\n# Calculate the total number of possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 1\nfor side in sides:\n    total_outcomes *= side\n\n# Calculate the number of favorable outcomes\nfavorable_outcomes = 0\n\n# Iterate over all possible outcomes\nfor outcome in product(range(1, sides[0] + 1), range(1, sides[1] + 1), range(1, sides[2] + 1), range(1, sides[3] + 1)):\n    if sum(outcome) >= 37:\n        favorable_outcomes += 1\n\n# Calculate the probability as a reduced fraction\nfrom math import gcd\n\ndef reduce_fraction(numerator, denominator):\n    common_divisor = gcd(numerator, denominator)\n    return numerator // common_divisor, denominator // common_divisor\n\nnumerator, denominator = reduce_fraction(favorable_outcomes, total_outcomes)\n\n# Print the result as a reduced fraction\nprint(f\"{numerator}/{denominator}\")\n```\n\nThis script calculates the total number of possible outcomes, iterates over all possible outcomes to count those that sum to 37 or more, and then reduces the fraction representing the probability. Let's execute this code to find the answer.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the result of the probability calculation. The probability of rolling a total of 37 or higher with the given dice (1d20, 1d15, 1d14, 1d9) is represented by the fraction 2057/7560. This fraction is already reduced to its simplest form.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2057/7560>>>"
