    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a total of 25 or higher using the given dice: 1d20, 1d10, 1d9, and 1d7. \n\nFirst, let's determine the total number of possible outcomes. Each die has a certain number of sides, and the total number of outcomes is the product of the number of sides of all dice:\n\n- 1d20 has 20 sides\n- 1d10 has 10 sides\n- 1d9 has 9 sides\n- 1d7 has 7 sides\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is \\(20 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 7\\).\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of favorable outcomes where the sum of the dice rolls is 25 or higher. We can do this by iterating over all possible combinations of dice rolls and counting those that meet the criteria.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the number of sides for each die\nsides = [20, 10, 9, 7]\n\n# Calculate the total number of possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 1\nfor side in sides:\n    total_outcomes *= side\n\n# Calculate the number of favorable outcomes\nfavorable_outcomes = 0\n\n# Iterate over all possible outcomes\nfor roll in product(range(1, sides[0] + 1), range(1, sides[1] + 1), range(1, sides[2] + 1), range(1, sides[3] + 1)):\n    if sum(roll) >= 25:\n        favorable_outcomes += 1\n\n# Calculate the probability as a reduced fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability = Fraction(favorable_outcomes, total_outcomes)\n\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nThis script will calculate the probability of rolling a total of 25 or higher and express it as a reduced fraction. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
    "The code has successfully calculated the probability of rolling a total of 25 or higher with the given dice. The result is expressed as a reduced fraction.\n\nThe probability of rolling 25 or higher with 1d20, 1d10, 1d9, and 1d7 is:\n\n<<<6611/12600>>>"
