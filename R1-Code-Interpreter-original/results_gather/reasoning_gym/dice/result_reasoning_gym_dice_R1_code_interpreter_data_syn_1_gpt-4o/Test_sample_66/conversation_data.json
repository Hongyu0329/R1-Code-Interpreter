    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a total of 32 or higher using the given dice: 1d20, 1d13, 1d13, and 1d3. \n\nFirst, let's understand the possible outcomes for each die:\n- 1d20: This die can roll any integer from 1 to 20.\n- 1d13: Each of these dice can roll any integer from 1 to 13.\n- 1d3: This die can roll any integer from 1 to 3.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of outcomes for each die:\n\\[ 20 \\times 13 \\times 13 \\times 3 \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of favorable outcomes where the sum of the dice is 32 or higher. This involves iterating over all possible combinations of rolls and counting those that meet the criteria.\n\nLet's write a Python script to calculate this:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the range of each die\nd20 = range(1, 21)\nd13_1 = range(1, 14)\nd13_2 = range(1, 14)\nd3 = range(1, 4)\n\n# Total number of possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 20 * 13 * 13 * 3\n\n# Count the number of favorable outcomes\nfavorable_outcomes = 0\n\n# Iterate over all possible combinations of rolls\nfor roll in product(d20, d13_1, d13_2, d3):\n    if sum(roll) >= 32:\n        favorable_outcomes += 1\n\n# Calculate the probability as a reduced fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability = Fraction(favorable_outcomes, total_outcomes)\n\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nThis script will calculate the probability of rolling a total of 32 or higher and express it as a reduced fraction. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the probability of rolling a total of 32 or higher using the given dice. The result is expressed as a reduced fraction.\n\nThe probability of rolling 32 or higher with the dice 1d20, 1d13, 1d13, and 1d3 is:\n\n<<<43/156>>>"
