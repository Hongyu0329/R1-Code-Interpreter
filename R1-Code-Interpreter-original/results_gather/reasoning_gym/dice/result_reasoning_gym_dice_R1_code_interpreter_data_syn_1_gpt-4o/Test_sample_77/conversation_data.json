    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a total of 35 or higher using the given dice: 1d20, 1d16, 1d10, and 1d9. \n\nFirst, let's determine the total number of possible outcomes. Each die has a certain number of sides, and each side represents a possible outcome. Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n\n- 1d20 has 20 sides\n- 1d16 has 16 sides\n- 1d10 has 10 sides\n- 1d9 has 9 sides\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is \\(20 \\times 16 \\times 10 \\times 9\\).\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of favorable outcomes, which are the outcomes where the sum of the dice is 35 or higher. This involves iterating over all possible combinations of dice rolls and counting those that meet the criteria.\n\nLet's write a Python script to calculate this:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of sides for each die\nsides_d20 = 20\nsides_d16 = 16\nsides_d10 = 10\nsides_d9 = 9\n\n# Initialize the count of favorable outcomes\nfavorable_outcomes = 0\n\n# Iterate over all possible outcomes\nfor d20 in range(1, sides_d20 + 1):\n    for d16 in range(1, sides_d16 + 1):\n        for d10 in range(1, sides_d10 + 1):\n            for d9 in range(1, sides_d9 + 1):\n                if d20 + d16 + d10 + d9 >= 35:\n                    favorable_outcomes += 1\n\n# Calculate the total number of possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = sides_d20 * sides_d16 * sides_d10 * sides_d9\n\n# Calculate the probability as a fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability = Fraction(favorable_outcomes, total_outcomes)\n\n# Print the reduced fraction\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nThis script will calculate the probability of rolling a total of 35 or higher and output it as a reduced fraction. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
