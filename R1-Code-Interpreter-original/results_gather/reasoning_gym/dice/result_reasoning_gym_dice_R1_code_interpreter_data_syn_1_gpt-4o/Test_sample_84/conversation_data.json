    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a total of 23 or higher using the given dice: 1d20, 1d19, 1d11, and 1d2. \n\nFirst, let's determine the total number of possible outcomes. Each die has a certain number of sides, and the total number of outcomes is the product of the number of sides of all dice:\n\n- 1d20 has 20 possible outcomes.\n- 1d19 has 19 possible outcomes.\n- 1d11 has 11 possible outcomes.\n- 1d2 has 2 possible outcomes.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Outcomes} = 20 \\times 19 \\times 11 \\times 2 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of favorable outcomes, i.e., the number of ways to roll a total of 23 or higher. This involves iterating over all possible combinations of dice rolls and counting those that sum to 23 or more.\n\nLet's write a Python script to calculate this:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of sides for each die\nsides_d20 = 20\nsides_d19 = 19\nsides_d11 = 11\nsides_d2 = 2\n\n# Calculate the total number of possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = sides_d20 * sides_d19 * sides_d11 * sides_d2\n\n# Initialize the count of favorable outcomes\nfavorable_outcomes = 0\n\n# Iterate over all possible outcomes\nfor roll_d20 in range(1, sides_d20 + 1):\n    for roll_d19 in range(1, sides_d19 + 1):\n        for roll_d11 in range(1, sides_d11 + 1):\n            for roll_d2 in range(1, sides_d2 + 1):\n                # Calculate the sum of the current roll\n                total_roll = roll_d20 + roll_d19 + roll_d11 + roll_d2\n                # Check if the sum is 23 or higher\n                if total_roll >= 23:\n                    favorable_outcomes += 1\n\n# Calculate the probability as a fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability = Fraction(favorable_outcomes, total_outcomes)\n\n# Print the reduced fraction representing the probability\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nThis script will calculate the probability of rolling a total of 23 or higher and output it as a reduced fraction. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
