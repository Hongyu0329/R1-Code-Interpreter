    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a total of 27 or higher using the given dice: 1d20, 1d19, 1d7, and 1d5. \n\nFirst, let's determine the possible outcomes for each die:\n- 1d20: 20 possible outcomes (1 to 20)\n- 1d19: 19 possible outcomes (1 to 19)\n- 1d7: 7 possible outcomes (1 to 7)\n- 1d5: 5 possible outcomes (1 to 5)\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of outcomes for each die:\n\\[ 20 \\times 19 \\times 7 \\times 5 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the number of favorable outcomes where the sum of the dice is 27 or higher. This involves iterating over all possible combinations of dice rolls and counting those that meet the criteria.\n\nLet's write a Python script to calculate this:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of sides for each die\nsides_d20 = 20\nsides_d19 = 19\nsides_d7 = 7\nsides_d5 = 5\n\n# Initialize the count of favorable outcomes\nfavorable_outcomes = 0\n\n# Iterate over all possible outcomes\nfor d20 in range(1, sides_d20 + 1):\n    for d19 in range(1, sides_d19 + 1):\n        for d7 in range(1, sides_d7 + 1):\n            for d5 in range(1, sides_d5 + 1):\n                if d20 + d19 + d7 + d5 >= 27:\n                    favorable_outcomes += 1\n\n# Calculate the total number of possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = sides_d20 * sides_d19 * sides_d7 * sides_d5\n\n# Calculate the probability as a fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability = Fraction(favorable_outcomes, total_outcomes)\n\n# Print the reduced fraction\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nThis script will calculate the number of favorable outcomes and the total number of possible outcomes, then compute the probability as a reduced fraction. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
