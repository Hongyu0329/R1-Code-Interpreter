    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a total of 24 or higher using the given dice: 1d20, 1d18, 1d12, and 1d5. \n\nFirst, let's understand the possible outcomes for each die:\n- 1d20: can roll any integer from 1 to 20.\n- 1d18: can roll any integer from 1 to 18.\n- 1d12: can roll any integer from 1 to 12.\n- 1d5: can roll any integer from 1 to 5.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n\\[ 20 \\times 18 \\times 12 \\times 5 \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of favorable outcomes where the sum of the dice is 24 or higher. This involves iterating over all possible combinations of dice rolls and counting those that meet the condition.\n\nLet's write a Python script to calculate this:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the number of sides for each die\nsides = [20, 18, 12, 5]\n\n# Calculate the total number of possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 1\nfor side in sides:\n    total_outcomes *= side\n\n# Calculate the number of favorable outcomes\nfavorable_outcomes = 0\n\n# Iterate over all possible outcomes\nfor roll in product(range(1, sides[0] + 1), range(1, sides[1] + 1), range(1, sides[2] + 1), range(1, sides[3] + 1)):\n    if sum(roll) >= 24:\n        favorable_outcomes += 1\n\n# Calculate the probability as a reduced fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability = Fraction(favorable_outcomes, total_outcomes)\n\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nThis script will calculate the probability of rolling a total of 24 or higher and express it as a reduced fraction. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the probability of rolling a total of 24 or higher using the given dice as a reduced fraction. \n\nThe probability is \\( \\frac{215}{288} \\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<215/288>>>"
