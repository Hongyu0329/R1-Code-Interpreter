    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a total of 28 or higher using the given dice: 1d20, 1d14, 1d13, and 1d12. \n\nFirst, let's determine the total number of possible outcomes. Each die has a certain number of sides, and the total number of outcomes is the product of the number of sides of all the dice:\n\n- 1d20 has 20 sides\n- 1d14 has 14 sides\n- 1d13 has 13 sides\n- 1d12 has 12 sides\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is \\(20 \\times 14 \\times 13 \\times 12\\).\n\nNext, we need to find the number of favorable outcomes where the sum of the dice is 28 or higher. This involves iterating over all possible combinations of dice rolls and counting those that meet the criteria.\n\nLet's write a Python script to calculate this:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the number of sides for each die\nsides = [20, 14, 13, 12]\n\n# Calculate the total number of possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 1\nfor side in sides:\n    total_outcomes *= side\n\n# Calculate the number of favorable outcomes\nfavorable_outcomes = 0\n\n# Iterate over all possible outcomes\nfor roll in product(range(1, sides[0] + 1), range(1, sides[1] + 1), range(1, sides[2] + 1), range(1, sides[3] + 1)):\n    if sum(roll) >= 28:\n        favorable_outcomes += 1\n\n# Calculate the probability as a reduced fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability = Fraction(favorable_outcomes, total_outcomes)\n\n# Output the probability\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nThis script will calculate the probability of rolling a total of 28 or higher and output it as a reduced fraction. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
