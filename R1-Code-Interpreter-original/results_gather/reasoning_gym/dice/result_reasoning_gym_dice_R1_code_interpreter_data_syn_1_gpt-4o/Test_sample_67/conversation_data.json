    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a total of 26 or higher using the given dice: 1d20, 1d14, 1d14, and 1d8. \n\nFirst, let's understand the possible outcomes for each die:\n- 1d20: Can roll any integer from 1 to 20.\n- 1d14: Can roll any integer from 1 to 14.\n- 1d14: Another die that can roll any integer from 1 to 14.\n- 1d8: Can roll any integer from 1 to 8.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of outcomes for each die:\n\\[ 20 \\times 14 \\times 14 \\times 8 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of favorable outcomes where the sum of the dice is 26 or higher. This involves iterating over all possible combinations of dice rolls and counting those that meet the criteria.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this calculation:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the range of each die\nd20 = range(1, 21)\nd14_1 = range(1, 15)\nd14_2 = range(1, 15)\nd8 = range(1, 9)\n\n# Total number of possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 20 * 14 * 14 * 8\n\n# Count the number of favorable outcomes\nfavorable_outcomes = 0\n\n# Iterate over all possible combinations of dice rolls\nfor roll in product(d20, d14_1, d14_2, d8):\n    if sum(roll) >= 26:\n        favorable_outcomes += 1\n\n# Calculate the probability as a reduced fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability = Fraction(favorable_outcomes, total_outcomes).limit_denominator()\n\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nThis script will calculate the probability of rolling a total of 26 or higher and express it as a reduced fraction. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the probability of rolling a total of 26 or higher using the given dice. The result is expressed as a reduced fraction.\n\nThe probability of rolling 26 or higher with the dice 1d20, 1d14, 1d14, and 1d8 is:\n\n<<<4351/6272>>>"
