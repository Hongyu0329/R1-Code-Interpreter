    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a total of 26 or higher using the given dice: 1d20, 1d8, 1d6, and 1d4. \n\nFirst, let's determine the possible outcomes for each die:\n- 1d20: Possible outcomes are 1 to 20.\n- 1d8: Possible outcomes are 1 to 8.\n- 1d6: Possible outcomes are 1 to 6.\n- 1d4: Possible outcomes are 1 to 4.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of outcomes for each die:\n\\[ 20 \\times 8 \\times 6 \\times 4 = 3840 \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the number of favorable outcomes where the sum of the dice is 26 or higher. We can do this by iterating over all possible combinations of dice rolls and counting those that meet the criteria.\n\nLet's write a Python script to calculate this:\n\n```python\n# Initialize the count of favorable outcomes\nfavorable_outcomes = 0\n\n# Iterate over all possible outcomes for each die\nfor d20 in range(1, 21):\n    for d8 in range(1, 9):\n        for d6 in range(1, 7):\n            for d4 in range(1, 5):\n                # Calculate the sum of the dice\n                total = d20 + d8 + d6 + d4\n                # Check if the sum is 26 or higher\n                if total >= 26:\n                    favorable_outcomes += 1\n\n# Total number of possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 20 * 8 * 6 * 4\n\n# Calculate the probability as a fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability = Fraction(favorable_outcomes, total_outcomes)\n\n# Print the reduced fraction\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nThis script will iterate over all possible combinations of dice rolls, count the number of favorable outcomes, and then calculate the probability as a reduced fraction. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
