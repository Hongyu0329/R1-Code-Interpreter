    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a total of 35 or higher using the given dice: 1d20, 1d18, 1d10, and 1d5. \n\nFirst, let's understand the possible outcomes for each die:\n- 1d20: Can roll any integer from 1 to 20.\n- 1d18: Can roll any integer from 1 to 18.\n- 1d10: Can roll any integer from 1 to 10.\n- 1d5: Can roll any integer from 1 to 5.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n\\[ 20 \\times 18 \\times 10 \\times 5 = 18000 \\]\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of favorable outcomes where the sum of the dice is 35 or higher. This involves iterating over all possible combinations of rolls and counting those that meet the criteria.\n\nTo efficiently compute this, we can use a Python script to iterate over all possible outcomes and count the number of successful ones.\n\n```python\n# Initialize the count of successful outcomes\nsuccessful_outcomes = 0\n\n# Iterate over all possible outcomes\nfor d20 in range(1, 21):\n    for d18 in range(1, 19):\n        for d10 in range(1, 11):\n            for d5 in range(1, 6):\n                # Calculate the sum of the current roll\n                total = d20 + d18 + d10 + d5\n                # Check if the sum is 35 or higher\n                if total >= 35:\n                    successful_outcomes += 1\n\n# Total number of possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 20 * 18 * 10 * 5\n\n# Calculate the probability as a fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability = Fraction(successful_outcomes, total_outcomes)\n\n# Print the reduced fraction\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nThis script will calculate the number of successful outcomes and then determine the probability as a reduced fraction. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
