    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a total of 22 or higher using the given dice: 1d20, 1d15, 1d13, and 1d8. \n\nFirst, let's determine the total number of possible outcomes. Each die has a certain number of sides, and each side represents a possible outcome. Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n\n- 1d20 has 20 sides\n- 1d15 has 15 sides\n- 1d13 has 13 sides\n- 1d8 has 8 sides\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is \\(20 \\times 15 \\times 13 \\times 8\\).\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of favorable outcomes, i.e., the number of ways to roll a total of 22 or higher. This involves iterating over all possible combinations of dice rolls and counting those that sum to 22 or more.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the number of sides for each die\nsides = [20, 15, 13, 8]\n\n# Calculate the total number of possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 1\nfor side in sides:\n    total_outcomes *= side\n\n# Calculate the number of favorable outcomes\nfavorable_outcomes = 0\n\n# Iterate over all possible outcomes\nfor roll in product(range(1, sides[0] + 1), range(1, sides[1] + 1), range(1, sides[2] + 1), range(1, sides[3] + 1)):\n    if sum(roll) >= 22:\n        favorable_outcomes += 1\n\n# Calculate the probability as a reduced fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability = Fraction(favorable_outcomes, total_outcomes)\n\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nThis script calculates the total number of possible outcomes, iterates over all possible combinations of dice rolls, counts the number of combinations that result in a sum of 22 or more, and then calculates the probability as a reduced fraction. Let's execute this code to find the probability.",
    "The code has successfully calculated the probability of rolling a total of 22 or higher with the given dice. The result is the fraction 5203/6240, which represents the probability of achieving this outcome.\n\nTo express this probability as a reduced fraction, we need to simplify 5203/6240. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 5203 and 6240 is 1, which means the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\nTherefore, the probability of rolling a total of 22 or higher with the dice 1d20, 1d15, 1d13, and 1d8 is:\n\n<<<5203/6240>>>"
