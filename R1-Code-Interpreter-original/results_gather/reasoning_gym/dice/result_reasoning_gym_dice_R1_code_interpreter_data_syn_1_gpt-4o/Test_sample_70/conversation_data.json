    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a total of 26 or higher using the given dice: 1d20, 1d13, 1d7, and 1d6. \n\nFirst, let's determine the total number of possible outcomes. Each die has a certain number of sides, and each side represents a possible outcome. Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n\n- 1d20 has 20 sides\n- 1d13 has 13 sides\n- 1d7 has 7 sides\n- 1d6 has 6 sides\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is:\n\\[ 20 \\times 13 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of favorable outcomes, which are the outcomes where the sum of the dice is 26 or higher. To do this, we can iterate over all possible outcomes and count those that meet the criteria.\n\nLet's write a Python script to calculate both the total number of outcomes and the number of favorable outcomes.\n\n```python\n# Define the number of sides for each die\nsides_d20 = 20\nsides_d13 = 13\nsides_d7 = 7\nsides_d6 = 6\n\n# Initialize the count of favorable outcomes\nfavorable_outcomes = 0\n\n# Iterate over all possible outcomes\nfor d20 in range(1, sides_d20 + 1):\n    for d13 in range(1, sides_d13 + 1):\n        for d7 in range(1, sides_d7 + 1):\n            for d6 in range(1, sides_d6 + 1):\n                # Calculate the sum of the dice\n                total = d20 + d13 + d7 + d6\n                # Check if the sum is 26 or higher\n                if total >= 26:\n                    favorable_outcomes += 1\n\n# Calculate the total number of possible outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = sides_d20 * sides_d13 * sides_d7 * sides_d6\n\n# Calculate the probability as a fraction\nfrom fractions import Fraction\nprobability = Fraction(favorable_outcomes, total_outcomes)\n\n# Print the reduced fraction\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nThis script will calculate the probability of rolling a total of 26 or higher and output it as a reduced fraction. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
