    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a sum of 23 or higher using the given dice: 1d20, 1d17, 1d13, and 1d5. \n\nFirst, let's understand the problem:\n- 1d20 means a 20-sided die, with possible outcomes from 1 to 20.\n- 1d17 means a 17-sided die, with possible outcomes from 1 to 17.\n- 1d13 means a 13-sided die, with possible outcomes from 1 to 13.\n- 1d5 means a 5-sided die, with possible outcomes from 1 to 5.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes when rolling all four dice is the product of the number of sides on each die:\n\\[ \\text{Total outcomes} = 20 \\times 17 \\times 13 \\times 5 \\]\n\nNext, we need to calculate the number of favorable outcomes where the sum of the dice is 23 or higher. This involves iterating over all possible combinations of dice rolls and counting those that meet the criteria.\n\nLet's write a Python script to calculate the total number of outcomes and the number of favorable outcomes, and then compute the probability as a reduced fraction.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Define the number of sides for each die\nsides = [20, 17, 13, 5]\n\n# Calculate the total number of outcomes\ntotal_outcomes = 1\nfor side in sides:\n    total_outcomes *= side\n\n# Initialize the count of favorable outcomes\nfavorable_outcomes = 0\n\n# Iterate over all possible outcomes\nfor d20 in range(1, 21):\n    for d17 in range(1, 18):\n        for d13 in range(1, 14):\n            for d5 in range(1, 6):\n                if d20 + d17 + d13 + d5 >= 23:\n                    favorable_outcomes += 1\n\n# Calculate the probability as a reduced fraction\nprobability = Fraction(favorable_outcomes, total_outcomes)\n\n# Output the probability\nprint(probability)\n```\n\nThis script will calculate the probability of rolling a sum of 23 or higher and output it as a reduced fraction. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
