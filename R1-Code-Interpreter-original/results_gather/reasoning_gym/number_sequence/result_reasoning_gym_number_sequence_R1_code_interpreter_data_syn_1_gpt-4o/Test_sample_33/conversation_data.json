    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence: -8, -8, -16, -24, -40, ?. \n\nLet's analyze the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n1. The difference between the first term (-8) and the second term (-8) is 0.\n2. The difference between the second term (-8) and the third term (-16) is -8.\n3. The difference between the third term (-16) and the fourth term (-24) is -8.\n4. The difference between the fourth term (-24) and the fifth term (-40) is -16.\n\nThe differences are: 0, -8, -8, -16.\n\nIt seems like the differences themselves are following a pattern. Let's analyze the differences of the differences:\n\n1. The difference between 0 and -8 is -8.\n2. The difference between -8 and -8 is 0.\n3. The difference between -8 and -16 is -8.\n\nThe second-level differences are: -8, 0, -8.\n\nThe pattern in the second-level differences suggests that the differences are alternating between -8 and 0. \n\nLet's predict the next difference in the sequence:\n\n- The last difference was -16, and the second-level difference pattern suggests the next difference should be -8 (since the pattern is -8, 0, -8).\n\nTherefore, the next term in the sequence should be the last term (-40) plus the next difference (-16 - 8 = -24).\n\nLet's calculate the next term:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the next term in the sequence\nlast_term = -40\nnext_difference = -16 - 8\nnext_term = last_term + next_difference\nprint(next_term)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the next term in the sequence.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output is -64. This means the next term in the sequence is -64.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is:\n\n<<<-64>>>"
