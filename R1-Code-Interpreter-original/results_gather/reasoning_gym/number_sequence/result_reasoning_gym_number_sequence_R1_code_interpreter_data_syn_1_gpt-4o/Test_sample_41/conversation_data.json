    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence: -4, -8, -16, -32, and then determine the next number in the sequence.\n\nFirst, let's examine the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n1. From -4 to -8: The difference is -8 - (-4) = -4.\n2. From -8 to -16: The difference is -16 - (-8) = -8.\n3. From -16 to -32: The difference is -32 - (-16) = -16.\n\nWe can see that each term is being multiplied by 2 to get the next term:\n\n- -4 * 2 = -8\n- -8 * 2 = -16\n- -16 * 2 = -32\n\nThus, the sequence is a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 2 to get the next term.\n\nTo find the next term after -32, we multiply -32 by 2:\n\n- -32 * 2 = -64\n\nTherefore, the next term in the sequence is -64.\n\nLet's confirm this by writing a simple Python script to compute the next term in the sequence:\n\n```python\n# Define the sequence\nsequence = [-4, -8, -16, -32]\n\n# Calculate the next term by multiplying the last term by 2\nnext_term = sequence[-1] * 2\n\n# Output the next term\nprint(next_term)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the output -64, which confirms our reasoning.\n\nTherefore, the next term in the sequence is:\n\n<<<-64>>>"
