    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the given sequence: -1, -1, -2, -3, -5, -8, -13, ?.\n\nThis sequence resembles the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. However, in this case, the sequence is negative. Let's verify this pattern:\n\n1. Start with the first two numbers: -1, -1.\n2. The third number is the sum of the first two: -1 + (-1) = -2.\n3. The fourth number is the sum of the second and third: -1 + (-2) = -3.\n4. The fifth number is the sum of the third and fourth: -2 + (-3) = -5.\n5. The sixth number is the sum of the fourth and fifth: -3 + (-5) = -8.\n6. The seventh number is the sum of the fifth and sixth: -5 + (-8) = -13.\n\nFollowing this pattern, the next number in the sequence should be the sum of the sixth and seventh numbers: -8 + (-13).\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the sequence\nsequence = [-1, -1, -2, -3, -5, -8, -13]\n\n# Calculate the next number in the sequence\nnext_number = sequence[-1] + sequence[-2]\n\n# Output the result\nprint(next_number)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the next number in the sequence.",
