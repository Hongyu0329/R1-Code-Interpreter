    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\nThe given sequence is: -6, -6, -12, -18, -30, -48, -78, ?\n\n1. **Identify the differences between consecutive terms:**\n\n   - The difference between the 1st and 2nd term: \\(-6 - (-6) = 0\\)\n   - The difference between the 2nd and 3rd term: \\(-12 - (-6) = -6\\)\n   - The difference between the 3rd and 4th term: \\(-18 - (-12) = -6\\)\n   - The difference between the 4th and 5th term: \\(-30 - (-18) = -12\\)\n   - The difference between the 5th and 6th term: \\(-48 - (-30) = -18\\)\n   - The difference between the 6th and 7th term: \\(-78 - (-48) = -30\\)\n\n2. **Analyze the differences:**\n\n   The differences are: 0, -6, -6, -12, -18, -30\n\n   We can see that the differences themselves form a sequence: 0, -6, -6, -12, -18, -30. \n\n3. **Identify the pattern in the differences:**\n\n   Let's look at the differences between these differences:\n\n   - The difference between the 1st and 2nd difference: \\(-6 - 0 = -6\\)\n   - The difference between the 2nd and 3rd difference: \\(-6 - (-6) = 0\\)\n   - The difference between the 3rd and 4th difference: \\(-12 - (-6) = -6\\)\n   - The difference between the 4th and 5th difference: \\(-18 - (-12) = -6\\)\n   - The difference between the 5th and 6th difference: \\(-30 - (-18) = -12\\)\n\n   The second-level differences are: -6, 0, -6, -6, -12\n\n4. **Identify the pattern in the second-level differences:**\n\n   The second-level differences seem to follow a pattern of decreasing by 6 every two steps. \n\n5. **Predict the next difference:**\n\n   Following the pattern, the next second-level difference should be \\(-12 - 6 = -18\\).\n\n6. **Calculate the next first-level difference:**\n\n   The last first-level difference was -30. Adding the next second-level difference of -18 gives us:\n\n   \\(-30 - 18 = -48\\)\n\n7. **Calculate the next term in the sequence:**\n\n   The last term in the sequence was -78. Adding the next first-level difference of -48 gives us:\n\n   \\(-78 - 48 = -126\\)\n\nTherefore, the next term in the sequence is -126.\n\n<<<-126>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
