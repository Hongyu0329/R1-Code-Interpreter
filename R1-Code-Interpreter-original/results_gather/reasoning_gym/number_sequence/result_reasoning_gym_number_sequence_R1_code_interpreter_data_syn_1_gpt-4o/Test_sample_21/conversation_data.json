    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence. The sequence given is: -4, -6, -10, -18, -34, -66, -130, ?\n\nLet's analyze the differences between consecutive terms to see if there's a pattern:\n\n1. Difference between -6 and -4: \\(-6 - (-4) = -2\\)\n2. Difference between -10 and -6: \\(-10 - (-6) = -4\\)\n3. Difference between -18 and -10: \\(-18 - (-10) = -8\\)\n4. Difference between -34 and -18: \\(-34 - (-18) = -16\\)\n5. Difference between -66 and -34: \\(-66 - (-34) = -32\\)\n6. Difference between -130 and -66: \\(-130 - (-66) = -64\\)\n\nThe differences are: -2, -4, -8, -16, -32, -64\n\nWe can see that each difference is double the previous one, suggesting a pattern of powers of 2. Specifically, the differences are \\(-2^1, -2^2, -2^3, -2^4, -2^5, -2^6\\).\n\nFollowing this pattern, the next difference should be \\(-2^7 = -128\\).\n\nTo find the next term in the sequence, we add this difference to the last known term:\n\n-130 + (-128) = -258\n\nLet's confirm this by writing a Python script to compute the next term in the sequence based on the identified pattern.\n\n```python\n# Initial sequence\nsequence = [-4, -6, -10, -18, -34, -66, -130]\n\n# Calculate the next difference\nnext_difference = -2 ** 7\n\n# Calculate the next term in the sequence\nnext_term = sequence[-1] + next_difference\n\n# Output the next term\nprint(next_term)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the next term in the sequence.",
    "The code executed successfully and confirmed that the next term in the sequence is -258. Therefore, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is:\n\n<<<-258>>>"
