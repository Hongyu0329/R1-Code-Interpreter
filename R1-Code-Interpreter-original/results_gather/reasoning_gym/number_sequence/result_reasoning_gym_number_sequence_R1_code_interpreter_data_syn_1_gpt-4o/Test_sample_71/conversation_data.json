    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence. The sequence given is: -6, -30, -78, -174, ?\n\nLet's analyze the differences between consecutive terms to see if there's a pattern:\n\n1. Difference between -30 and -6: \\(-30 - (-6) = -24\\)\n2. Difference between -78 and -30: \\(-78 - (-30) = -48\\)\n3. Difference between -174 and -78: \\(-174 - (-78) = -96\\)\n\nThe differences are: -24, -48, -96. \n\nWe can observe that each difference is double the previous one:\n- \\(-48 = 2 \\times -24\\)\n- \\(-96 = 2 \\times -48\\)\n\nFollowing this pattern, the next difference should be \\(2 \\times -96 = -192\\).\n\nNow, let's calculate the next term in the sequence by adding this difference to the last known term (-174):\n\n\\(-174 + (-192) = -366\\)\n\nThus, the next term in the sequence is -366.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is -366.\n\n<<<-366>>>"
