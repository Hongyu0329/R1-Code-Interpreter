    "The sequence given is 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and it appears to be an arithmetic sequence. In an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Let's determine the common difference and find the next term in the sequence.\n\n1. Calculate the common difference:\n   - The difference between the first and second term is \\(2 - 0 = 2\\).\n   - The difference between the second and third term is \\(4 - 2 = 2\\).\n   - The difference between the third and fourth term is \\(6 - 4 = 2\\).\n   - The difference between the fourth and fifth term is \\(8 - 6 = 2\\).\n\nThe common difference is 2.\n\n2. To find the next term in the sequence, add the common difference to the last term:\n   - Last term is 8.\n   - Next term = 8 + 2 = 10.\n\nTherefore, the next term in the sequence is 10.\n\n<<<10>>>"
