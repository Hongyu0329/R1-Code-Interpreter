    "To solve this sequence, we need to identify the pattern or rule that governs the progression of numbers. Let's analyze the given sequence:\n\n1. The sequence starts with 6, 6, 12, 18, and we need to find the next number.\n2. The first two numbers are the same: 6, 6.\n3. The third number is 12, which is double the first number (6 * 2 = 12).\n4. The fourth number is 18, which is the third number plus 6 (12 + 6 = 18).\n\nLet's try to identify a pattern:\n\n- The first two numbers are the same.\n- The third number is double the first number.\n- The fourth number is the third number plus the first number.\n\nTo find the next number, we can assume the pattern continues by adding the first number (6) to the last number (18).\n\nLet's verify this by calculating the next number:\n\n```python\n# Define the sequence\nsequence = [6, 6, 12, 18]\n\n# Calculate the next number in the sequence\nnext_number = sequence[-1] + sequence[0]\n\n# Output the next number\nprint(next_number)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the next number in the sequence.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the next number in the sequence as 24. Based on the pattern identified, the next number is obtained by adding the first number (6) to the last number in the sequence (18).\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is:\n\n<<<24>>>"
