    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence: 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, ?. \n\nLet's analyze the sequence:\n\n1. The first number is 3.\n2. The second number is 1.\n3. The third number is 0.\n4. The fourth number is 0.\n5. The fifth number is 0.\n6. The sixth number is 0.\n\nThe sequence seems to be decreasing and then stabilizing at 0. \n\nLet's consider the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n- Difference between 3 and 1 is -2.\n- Difference between 1 and 0 is -1.\n- Difference between 0 and 0 is 0.\n- Difference between 0 and 0 is 0.\n- Difference between 0 and 0 is 0.\n\nThe differences suggest that the sequence decreases by 2, then by 1, and then remains constant at 0. \n\nGiven this pattern, it seems that the sequence has reached a stable state at 0, and the next term is likely to be 0 as well.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is likely to be 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
