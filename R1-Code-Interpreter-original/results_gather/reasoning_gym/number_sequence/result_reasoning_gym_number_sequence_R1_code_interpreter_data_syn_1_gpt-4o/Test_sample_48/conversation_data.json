    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the given sequence: 7, 7, 14, 21, 35, 56, ?.\n\nLet's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. The first two numbers are both 7.\n2. The third number is 14, which is 7 + 7.\n3. The fourth number is 21, which is 14 + 7.\n4. The fifth number is 35, which is 21 + 14.\n5. The sixth number is 56, which is 35 + 21.\n\nIt seems that each number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding numbers. This is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but it starts with two 7s instead of 0 and 1.\n\nTo find the next number in the sequence, we need to add the last two numbers: 35 and 56.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define the sequence\nsequence = [7, 7, 14, 21, 35, 56]\n\n# Calculate the next number in the sequence\nnext_number = sequence[-1] + sequence[-2]\n\n# Output the result\nprint(next_number)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the next number in the sequence.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the next number in the sequence. Based on the pattern identified, the next number is the sum of the last two numbers in the sequence, 35 and 56, which equals 91.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is:\n\n<<<91>>>"
