    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence of numbers: 5, 19, 33, 47, 61, 75, 89, and then determine the next number in the sequence.\n\nFirst, let's examine the differences between consecutive terms in the sequence:\n\n- 19 - 5 = 14\n- 33 - 19 = 14\n- 47 - 33 = 14\n- 61 - 47 = 14\n- 75 - 61 = 14\n- 89 - 75 = 14\n\nThe difference between each consecutive term is consistently 14. This indicates that the sequence is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 14.\n\nTo find the next term in the sequence, we simply add 14 to the last term (89).\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the next term in the sequence\nlast_term = 89\ncommon_difference = 14\nnext_term = last_term + common_difference\nprint(next_term)\n```\n\nExecuting the above code will give us the next term in the sequence.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the next term in the sequence. Based on the arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 14, the next term after 89 is 103.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is:\n\n<<<103>>>"
