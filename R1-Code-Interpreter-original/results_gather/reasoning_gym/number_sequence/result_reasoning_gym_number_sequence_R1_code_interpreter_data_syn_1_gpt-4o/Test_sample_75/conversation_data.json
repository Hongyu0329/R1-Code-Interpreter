    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence: 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, ?. \n\nLet's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. The first number is 3.\n2. The second number is 1, which is 3 - 2.\n3. The third number is 0, which is 1 - 1.\n4. The fourth number is 0, which is 0 - 0.\n5. The fifth number is 0, which is 0 - 0.\n\nIt seems that after the initial two numbers, the sequence stabilizes at 0. This suggests that the sequence might continue with 0 indefinitely after reaching the first 0.\n\nTo confirm this, let's write a simple Python script to verify the pattern and predict the next number in the sequence.\n\n```python\nsequence = [3, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nnext_value = sequence[-1] - (sequence[-2] - sequence[-3])\nprint(next_value)\n```\n\nThis script calculates the next value in the sequence based on the observed pattern. Let's execute it to find the value of \"?\".",
    "The code executed without any errors, and the output is 0. This confirms our analysis that the sequence stabilizes at 0 after the initial numbers. Therefore, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
