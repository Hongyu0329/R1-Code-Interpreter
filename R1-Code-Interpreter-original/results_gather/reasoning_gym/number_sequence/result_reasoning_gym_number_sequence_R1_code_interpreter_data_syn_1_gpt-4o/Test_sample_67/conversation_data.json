    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence and use it to find the next number.\n\nThe given sequence is: 6, -12, 24, -48, 96, -192, 384, ?\n\nLet's analyze the sequence:\n\n1. 6 to -12: Multiply by -2\n2. -12 to 24: Multiply by -2\n3. 24 to -48: Multiply by -2\n4. -48 to 96: Multiply by -2\n5. 96 to -192: Multiply by -2\n6. -192 to 384: Multiply by -2\n\nThe pattern is that each number is multiplied by -2 to get the next number in the sequence.\n\nTo find the next number after 384, we multiply 384 by -2.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Current number in the sequence\ncurrent_number = 384\n\n# Calculate the next number by multiplying by -2\nnext_number = current_number * -2\n\n# Output the result\nprint(next_number)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the next number in the sequence.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the next number in the sequence. Based on the pattern of multiplying each number by -2, the next number after 384 is -768.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is:\n\n<<<-768>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
