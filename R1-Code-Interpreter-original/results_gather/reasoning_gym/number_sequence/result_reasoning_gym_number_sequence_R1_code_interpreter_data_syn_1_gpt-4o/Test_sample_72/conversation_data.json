    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence. Let's analyze the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n1. \\(-6 - (-2) = -4\\)\n2. \\(-12 - (-6) = -6\\)\n3. \\(-22 - (-12) = -10\\)\n4. \\(-38 - (-22) = -16\\)\n5. \\(-64 - (-38) = -26\\)\n6. \\(-106 - (-64) = -42\\)\n7. \\(-174 - (-106) = -68\\)\n\nThe differences between consecutive terms are: \\(-4, -6, -10, -16, -26, -42, -68\\).\n\nLet's examine the differences between these differences:\n\n1. \\(-6 - (-4) = -2\\)\n2. \\(-10 - (-6) = -4\\)\n3. \\(-16 - (-10) = -6\\)\n4. \\(-26 - (-16) = -10\\)\n5. \\(-42 - (-26) = -16\\)\n6. \\(-68 - (-42) = -26\\)\n\nThe second-level differences are: \\(-2, -4, -6, -10, -16, -26\\).\n\nThe pattern in the second-level differences seems to be the same as the first-level differences, suggesting a recursive pattern. Let's use this pattern to predict the next difference and the next term in the sequence.\n\nTo find the next term, we need to calculate the next difference in the first-level differences and add it to the last term in the sequence.\n\nLet's write a Python script to compute the next term in the sequence:\n\n```python\n# Initial sequence\nsequence = [-2, -6, -12, -22, -38, -64, -106, -174]\n\n# Calculate first-level differences\nfirst_level_differences = [sequence[i] - sequence[i-1] for i in range(1, len(sequence))]\n\n# Calculate second-level differences\nsecond_level_differences = [first_level_differences[i] - first_level_differences[i-1] for i in range(1, len(first_level_differences))]\n\n# Predict the next second-level difference\nnext_second_level_difference = second_level_differences[-1] + (second_level_differences[-1] - second_level_differences[-2])\n\n# Predict the next first-level difference\nnext_first_level_difference = first_level_differences[-1] + next_second_level_difference\n\n# Predict the next term in the sequence\nnext_term = sequence[-1] + next_first_level_difference\n\nprint(next_term)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the next term in the sequence based on the identified pattern. Let's execute it to find the value of \"?\".",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the next term in the sequence. Based on the pattern identified in the differences, the next term in the sequence is \\(-278\\).\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is:\n\n<<<-278>>>"
