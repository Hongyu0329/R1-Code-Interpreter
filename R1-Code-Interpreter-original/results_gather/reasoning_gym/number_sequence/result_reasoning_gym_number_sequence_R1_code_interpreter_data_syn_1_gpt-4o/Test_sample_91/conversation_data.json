    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence of numbers: -9, -14, -21, -32, and then determine the next number in the sequence.\n\nFirst, let's examine the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n1. Difference between -9 and -14: \\(-14 - (-9) = -5\\)\n2. Difference between -14 and -21: \\(-21 - (-14) = -7\\)\n3. Difference between -21 and -32: \\(-32 - (-21) = -11\\)\n\nThe differences are -5, -7, and -11. We can see that these differences are not constant, but they seem to be increasing. Let's examine the differences between these differences:\n\n1. Difference between -5 and -7: \\(-7 - (-5) = -2\\)\n2. Difference between -7 and -11: \\(-11 - (-7) = -4\\)\n\nThe second-level differences are -2 and -4, which suggests a pattern. The differences are increasing by -2 each time. If this pattern continues, the next difference should be:\n\n\\(-11 + (-4) = -15\\)\n\nNow, let's calculate the next term in the sequence by adding this difference to the last known term (-32):\n\n\\(-32 + (-15) = -47\\)\n\nThus, the next number in the sequence should be -47.\n\nLet's confirm this by writing a small Python script to compute the next term based on the identified pattern.\n\n```python\n# Initial sequence\nsequence = [-9, -14, -21, -32]\n\n# Calculate the differences between consecutive terms\ndifferences = [sequence[i] - sequence[i-1] for i in range(1, len(sequence))]\n\n# Calculate the second-level differences\nsecond_level_differences = [differences[i] - differences[i-1] for i in range(1, len(differences))]\n\n# Predict the next difference\nnext_difference = differences[-1] + second_level_differences[-1]\n\n# Calculate the next term in the sequence\nnext_term = sequence[-1] + next_difference\n\nprint(next_term)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we should get the next term in the sequence. Let's see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the output -47, which matches our manual calculation. Therefore, the next number in the sequence is -47.\n\n<<<-47>>>"
