    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the given sequence: -10, -3, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, ?.\n\nLet's analyze the sequence:\n\n1. The first number is -10.\n2. The second number is -3.\n3. From the third number onwards, the sequence is -1 repeated multiple times.\n\nThe sequence seems to start with two distinct numbers, -10 and -3, followed by a series of -1s. The pattern suggests that after the initial two numbers, the sequence stabilizes at -1.\n\nGiven that the sequence has stabilized at -1 from the third position onwards, it is reasonable to assume that the next number in the sequence will also be -1.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is likely to be -1.\n\nLet's confirm this reasoning by checking if there is any other possible pattern or if the sequence continues with -1.\n\n```python\n# Let's check the sequence pattern\nsequence = [-10, -3, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1]\nnext_value = sequence[-1]  # The sequence stabilizes at -1\nprint(next_value)\n```\n\nThe code will confirm the next value in the sequence based on the observed pattern.",
    "The code output confirms our reasoning that the sequence stabilizes at -1 after the initial two numbers. Therefore, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is -1.\n\n<<<-1>>>"
