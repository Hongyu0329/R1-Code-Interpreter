    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the given sequence: -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, ?. \n\nLet's analyze the sequence:\n\n1. The first term is -1.\n2. The subsequent terms are all 1.\n\nThe sequence seems to start with -1 and then continues with 1s. There is no apparent arithmetic or geometric progression, and the sequence does not seem to follow a complex pattern. It appears to be a simple sequence where the first term is -1, and all following terms are 1.\n\nGiven this observation, it is reasonable to conclude that the next term in the sequence is also 1.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, ?\nOutput the value of \"?\" enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the value of \"?\">>>."
