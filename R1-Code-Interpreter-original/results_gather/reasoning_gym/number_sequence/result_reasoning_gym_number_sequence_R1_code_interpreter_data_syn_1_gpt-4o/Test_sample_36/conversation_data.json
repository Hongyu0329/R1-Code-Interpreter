    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the given sequence: -5, -3, -2, -1, -1, -1, -1, ?.\n\nLet's analyze the sequence:\n\n1. The first number is -5.\n2. The second number is -3, which is 2 more than -5.\n3. The third number is -2, which is 1 more than -3.\n4. The fourth number is -1, which is 1 more than -2.\n5. The fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth numbers are all -1.\n\nFrom this, we can observe that the sequence starts by increasing, but then it stabilizes at -1. The pattern seems to be that after reaching -1, the sequence remains constant at -1.\n\nTherefore, the next number in the sequence should also be -1.\n\nLet's confirm this by generating a Python script to verify the pattern and predict the next number.\n\n```python\n# Define the sequence\nsequence = [-5, -3, -2, -1, -1, -1, -1]\n\n# Check the differences between consecutive numbers\ndifferences = [sequence[i+1] - sequence[i] for i in range(len(sequence) - 1)]\n\n# Print the differences\nprint(\"Differences:\", differences)\n\n# Predict the next number based on the pattern\nnext_number = sequence[-1]  # Since the sequence stabilizes at -1\nprint(\"Next number in the sequence:\", next_number)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify our reasoning.",
    "The code output confirms our reasoning. The differences between consecutive numbers are [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], indicating that the sequence initially increases and then stabilizes at -1. Therefore, the next number in the sequence is also -1.\n\n<<<-1>>>"
