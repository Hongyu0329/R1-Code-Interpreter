    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence: 8, 5, 3, 2, 2, ?. \n\nLet's analyze the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n- The difference between 8 and 5 is 3.\n- The difference between 5 and 3 is 2.\n- The difference between 3 and 2 is 1.\n- The difference between 2 and 2 is 0.\n\nThe differences are decreasing by 1 each time: 3, 2, 1, 0. \n\nIf this pattern continues, the next difference should be -1. Therefore, the next term in the sequence should be 2 - 1 = 1.\n\nLet's confirm this by writing a small Python script to compute the next term based on the identified pattern.\n\n```python\nsequence = [8, 5, 3, 2, 2]\ndifferences = [3, 2, 1, 0]\n\n# Calculate the next difference\nnext_difference = differences[-1] - 1\n\n# Calculate the next term in the sequence\nnext_term = sequence[-1] + next_difference\n\nprint(next_term)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm the next term in the sequence.",
