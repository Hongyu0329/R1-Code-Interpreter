    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the given sequence: 7, 14, 28, 56, 112, and then determine the next number in the sequence.\n\nLet's analyze the sequence:\n\n1. 7 to 14: The number doubles (7 * 2 = 14).\n2. 14 to 28: The number doubles again (14 * 2 = 28).\n3. 28 to 56: The number doubles again (28 * 2 = 56).\n4. 56 to 112: The number doubles again (56 * 2 = 112).\n\nThe pattern is that each number is double the previous number. Therefore, to find the next number in the sequence, we need to double 112.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Given sequence\nsequence = [7, 14, 28, 56, 112]\n\n# Calculate the next number in the sequence\nnext_number = sequence[-1] * 2\n\n# Output the result\nprint(next_number)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the next number in the sequence.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the next number in the sequence. Based on the pattern of doubling each number, the next number after 112 is 224.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is:\n\n<<<224>>>"
