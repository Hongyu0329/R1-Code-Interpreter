    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence. Let's analyze the sequence:\n\n- The sequence is: -2, -2, -4, -6, -10, -16, -26, -42, ?\n\nFirst, let's look at the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n1. -2 to -2: difference = 0\n2. -2 to -4: difference = -2\n3. -4 to -6: difference = -2\n4. -6 to -10: difference = -4\n5. -10 to -16: difference = -6\n6. -16 to -26: difference = -10\n7. -26 to -42: difference = -16\n\nThe differences themselves form a sequence: 0, -2, -2, -4, -6, -10, -16\n\nNow, let's look at the differences of these differences:\n\n1. 0 to -2: difference = -2\n2. -2 to -2: difference = 0\n3. -2 to -4: difference = -2\n4. -4 to -6: difference = -2\n5. -6 to -10: difference = -4\n6. -10 to -16: difference = -6\n\nThe second-level differences are: -2, 0, -2, -2, -4, -6\n\nIt seems like the second-level differences are decreasing by 2, which suggests a pattern. Let's verify this by calculating the next difference and the next term in the sequence.\n\nTo find the next term in the sequence, we need to calculate the next first-level difference and add it to the last term in the sequence.\n\nLet's write a Python script to calculate the next term in the sequence based on this pattern.\n\n```python\n# Initial sequence\nsequence = [-2, -2, -4, -6, -10, -16, -26, -42]\n\n# Calculate first-level differences\nfirst_level_differences = [sequence[i] - sequence[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(sequence))]\n\n# Calculate second-level differences\nsecond_level_differences = [first_level_differences[i] - first_level_differences[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(first_level_differences))]\n\n# Calculate the next second-level difference\nnext_second_level_difference = second_level_differences[-1] - 2\n\n# Calculate the next first-level difference\nnext_first_level_difference = first_level_differences[-1] + next_second_level_difference\n\n# Calculate the next term in the sequence\nnext_term = sequence[-1] + next_first_level_difference\n\nprint(next_term)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the next term in the sequence.",
    "The code execution output indicates that the next term in the sequence is -66. This result is consistent with the pattern we identified in the sequence's differences.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is:\n\n<<<-66>>>"
