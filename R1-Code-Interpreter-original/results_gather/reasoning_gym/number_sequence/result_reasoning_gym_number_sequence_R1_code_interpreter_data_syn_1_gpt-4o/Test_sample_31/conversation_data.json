    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence: -8, -2, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, ?. \n\nLet's analyze the sequence:\n\n1. The first number is -8.\n2. The second number is -2. The difference between -8 and -2 is 6.\n3. The third number is -1. The difference between -2 and -1 is 1.\n4. The fourth to seventh numbers are all -1, indicating a repetition.\n\nThe sequence seems to start with a decreasing pattern in the absolute value of the numbers, followed by a repetition of -1. \n\nTo determine the next number, we should consider the pattern of differences and repetitions. The sequence might be stabilizing at -1 after the initial changes. \n\nLet's verify this by checking if the sequence is following a specific rule or if it is simply repeating -1 after the initial changes. \n\nSince the sequence has stabilized at -1, it is reasonable to assume that the next number will also be -1, following the pattern of repetition.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is -1.\n\n<<<-1>>>"
