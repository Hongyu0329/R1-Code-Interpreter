    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the given sequence: 10, 10, 20, 30, 50, ?. \n\nLet's analyze the sequence:\n\n1. The first two numbers are both 10.\n2. The third number is 20, which is the sum of the first two numbers (10 + 10).\n3. The fourth number is 30, which is the sum of the second and third numbers (10 + 20).\n4. The fifth number is 50, which is the sum of the third and fourth numbers (20 + 30).\n\nFrom this, we can deduce that each number in the sequence (starting from the third) is the sum of the two preceding numbers. This is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but with different starting values.\n\nTo find the next number in the sequence, we need to add the fourth and fifth numbers:\n\n- Fourth number: 30\n- Fifth number: 50\n\nLet's calculate the next number:\n\n```python\n# Define the sequence\nsequence = [10, 10, 20, 30, 50]\n\n# Calculate the next number in the sequence\nnext_number = sequence[-1] + sequence[-2]\n\n# Output the result\nprint(next_number)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the next number in the sequence.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the next number in the sequence as 80. Based on the pattern identified, each number in the sequence is the sum of the two preceding numbers. Therefore, the value of \"?\" in the sequence 10, 10, 20, 30, 50, ? is:\n\n<<<80>>>"
