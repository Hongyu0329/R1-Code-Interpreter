    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence. The sequence given is: -2, 4, -10, 24, -58, 140, ?\n\nLet's analyze the differences between consecutive terms to see if there's a pattern:\n\n1. 4 - (-2) = 6\n2. -10 - 4 = -14\n3. 24 - (-10) = 34\n4. -58 - 24 = -82\n5. 140 - (-58) = 198\n\nThe differences are: 6, -14, 34, -82, 198\n\nNow, let's analyze the differences of these differences:\n\n1. -14 - 6 = -20\n2. 34 - (-14) = 48\n3. -82 - 34 = -116\n4. 198 - (-82) = 280\n\nThe second differences are: -20, 48, -116, 280\n\nLet's analyze the differences of these second differences:\n\n1. 48 - (-20) = 68\n2. -116 - 48 = -164\n3. 280 - (-116) = 396\n\nThe third differences are: 68, -164, 396\n\nLet's analyze the differences of these third differences:\n\n1. -164 - 68 = -232\n2. 396 - (-164) = 560\n\nThe fourth differences are: -232, 560\n\nLet's analyze the differences of these fourth differences:\n\n1. 560 - (-232) = 792\n\nThe fifth difference is: 792\n\nThe differences are not constant, but they seem to follow a pattern. Let's try to find a polynomial or a recursive relation that fits this sequence. Given the complexity, it might be a higher-order polynomial.\n\nTo find the next term in the sequence, we can use the differences we've calculated. The pattern in the differences suggests a recursive relation or a polynomial of higher degree. Let's use the differences to predict the next term.\n\nWe can use the differences to predict the next term in the sequence by adding the last difference to the last term:\n\n1. Calculate the next difference in the sequence of differences.\n2. Add this difference to the last term in the sequence to get the next term.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the next term in the sequence.\n\n```python\n# Initial sequence\nsequence = [-2, 4, -10, 24, -58, 140]\n\n# Calculate the differences\ndef calculate_differences(seq):\n    return [seq[i+1] - seq[i] for i in range(len(seq) - 1)]\n\n# Calculate the next term using differences\ndef next_term(seq):\n    differences = [seq]\n    while len(differences[-1]) > 1:\n        differences.append(calculate_differences(differences[-1]))\n    \n    # Calculate the next difference\n    next_diff = differences[-1][0]\n    for i in range(len(differences) - 2, -1, -1):\n        next_diff += differences[i][-1]\n    \n    # Calculate the next term\n    return seq[-1] + next_diff\n\n# Find the next term in the sequence\nnext_value = next_term(sequence)\nprint(next_value)\n```\n\nThe code will calculate the next term in the sequence using the differences method. Let's execute it to find the value of \"?\".",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the value 2506. This means that the next term in the sequence is 2506.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is:\n\n<<<2506>>>"
