    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence: -10, -5, -3, -2, -1, -1, ?. \n\nLet's analyze the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n1. From -10 to -5: the difference is 5.\n2. From -5 to -3: the difference is 2.\n3. From -3 to -2: the difference is 1.\n4. From -2 to -1: the difference is 1.\n5. From -1 to -1: the difference is 0.\n\nThe differences are: 5, 2, 1, 1, 0.\n\nThe differences themselves seem to be decreasing by 3, 1, 0, 0, and then 0. \n\nThe pattern in the differences suggests that the next difference might also be 0, as the last two differences are 0. \n\nIf the next difference is 0, then the next term in the sequence will be the same as the last term, which is -1.\n\nLet's confirm this by generating a Python script to calculate the next term based on the observed pattern.\n\n```python\n# Define the sequence\nsequence = [-10, -5, -3, -2, -1, -1]\n\n# Calculate the differences\ndifferences = [sequence[i] - sequence[i-1] for i in range(1, len(sequence))]\n\n# Predict the next difference\nnext_difference = 0  # Based on the pattern observed\n\n# Calculate the next term\nnext_term = sequence[-1] + next_difference\n\n# Output the next term\nprint(next_term)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the next term in the sequence.",
    "The code execution confirms that the next term in the sequence is -1. The pattern of differences suggests that the sequence continues with the same value as the last term due to the difference being zero.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is:\n\n<<<-1>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
