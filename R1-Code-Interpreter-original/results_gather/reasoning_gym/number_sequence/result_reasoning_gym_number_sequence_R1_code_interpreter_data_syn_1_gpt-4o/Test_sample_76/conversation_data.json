    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the given sequence: -5, 5, -5, 5, -5, ?. \n\nLet's analyze the sequence:\n\n1. The sequence alternates between -5 and 5.\n2. The first term is -5, the second term is 5, the third term is -5, the fourth term is 5, and the fifth term is -5.\n\nFrom this pattern, it appears that the sequence alternates between -5 and 5. The odd-indexed terms (1st, 3rd, 5th) are -5, and the even-indexed terms (2nd, 4th) are 5.\n\nSince the next term in the sequence is the 6th term, which is an even-indexed term, it should be 5.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
