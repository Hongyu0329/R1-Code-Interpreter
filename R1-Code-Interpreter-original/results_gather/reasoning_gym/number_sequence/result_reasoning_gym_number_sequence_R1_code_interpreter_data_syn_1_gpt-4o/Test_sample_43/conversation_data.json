    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence: -2, -2, -4, -6, ?. \n\nLet's analyze the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n1. The difference between the first term (-2) and the second term (-2) is 0.\n2. The difference between the second term (-2) and the third term (-4) is -2.\n3. The difference between the third term (-4) and the fourth term (-6) is -2.\n\nThe differences are 0, -2, -2. It seems like the sequence is decreasing by 0, then -2, then -2. \n\nTo predict the next term, we can assume the pattern continues with another -2 difference. \n\nLet's calculate the next term:\n\n- The fourth term is -6.\n- If we subtract 2 from -6, we get -8.\n\nTherefore, the next term in the sequence should be -8.\n\n<<<-8>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    -2, -2, -4, -6, ?\nOutput the value of \"?\" enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the value of \"?\">>>."
