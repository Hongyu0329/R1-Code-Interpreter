    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence: 8, 4, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, ?. \n\nLet's analyze the sequence:\n\n1. The first number is 8.\n2. The second number is 4, which is half of 8.\n3. The third number is 2, which is half of 4.\n4. The fourth number is 1, which is half of 2.\n5. The fifth number is 0, which is half of 1 (rounded down).\n6. The sixth and seventh numbers are also 0.\n\nThe pattern seems to be that each number is half of the previous number, rounded down to the nearest integer. Once the sequence reaches 0, it stays at 0.\n\nGiven this pattern, the next number in the sequence after three consecutive 0s should also be 0.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
