    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence: 2, -2, -6, -10, -14, ?. \n\nLet's analyze the sequence:\n\n1. The first term is 2.\n2. The second term is -2.\n3. The third term is -6.\n4. The fourth term is -10.\n5. The fifth term is -14.\n\nWe can observe that each term after the first is obtained by subtracting 4 from the previous term:\n\n- From 2 to -2: 2 - 4 = -2\n- From -2 to -6: -2 - 4 = -6\n- From -6 to -10: -6 - 4 = -10\n- From -10 to -14: -10 - 4 = -14\n\nThe pattern is consistent: each term is 4 less than the previous term. Therefore, to find the next term in the sequence, we subtract 4 from -14.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the last known term in the sequence\nlast_term = -14\n\n# Calculate the next term by subtracting 4\nnext_term = last_term - 4\n\n# Output the next term\nprint(next_term)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the value of the next term in the sequence.",
    "The code executed correctly and calculated the next term in the sequence. Based on the pattern identified, each term is 4 less than the previous term. Therefore, the next term after -14 is -18.\n\nThus, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is:\n\n<<<-18>>>"
