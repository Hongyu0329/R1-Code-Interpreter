    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence: -8, -16, -32, -64, and determine the next number.\n\nFirst, let's examine the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n1. From -8 to -16: The difference is -16 - (-8) = -8.\n2. From -16 to -32: The difference is -32 - (-16) = -16.\n3. From -32 to -64: The difference is -64 - (-32) = -32.\n\nWe can observe that each term is being multiplied by 2 to get the next term. This is a geometric sequence where each term is double the previous term.\n\nTo find the next term in the sequence, we multiply the last term by 2:\n\n-64 * 2 = -128\n\nThus, the next term in the sequence is -128.\n\nNow, let's output the value of \"?\":\n\n```python\n# Calculate the next term in the sequence\nlast_term = -64\nnext_term = last_term * 2\nprint(next_term)\n```\n\nExecuting the code will confirm the next term in the sequence.",
