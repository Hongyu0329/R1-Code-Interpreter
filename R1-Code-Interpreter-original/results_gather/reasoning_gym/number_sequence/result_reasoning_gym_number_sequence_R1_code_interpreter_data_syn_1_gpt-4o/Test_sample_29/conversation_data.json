    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the given sequence: -1, -2, -4, -8, -16, -32.\n\nLet's analyze the sequence:\n\n1. The first term is -1.\n2. The second term is -2, which is -1 multiplied by 2.\n3. The third term is -4, which is -2 multiplied by 2.\n4. The fourth term is -8, which is -4 multiplied by 2.\n5. The fifth term is -16, which is -8 multiplied by 2.\n6. The sixth term is -32, which is -16 multiplied by 2.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can see that each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by 2. This is a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 2.\n\nTo find the next term in the sequence, we multiply the last term (-32) by 2.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define the last known term in the sequence\nlast_term = -32\n\n# Calculate the next term by multiplying the last term by 2\nnext_term = last_term * 2\n\n# Output the next term\nprint(next_term)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the next term in the sequence.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the next term in the sequence. Based on the pattern identified, each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by 2. Therefore, the next term after -32 is -64.\n\nThus, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is:\n\n<<<-64>>>"
