    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence: -1, -1, -2, -3, ?. \n\nLet's analyze the sequence:\n\n1. The first term is -1.\n2. The second term is also -1.\n3. The third term is -2.\n4. The fourth term is -3.\n\nWe need to determine the pattern or rule that governs the sequence to find the next term.\n\nObserving the sequence, it seems that the difference between consecutive terms might be a key to understanding the pattern:\n\n- The difference between the first and second term is 0 (-1 - (-1) = 0).\n- The difference between the second and third term is -1 (-2 - (-1) = -1).\n- The difference between the third and fourth term is -1 (-3 - (-2) = -1).\n\nIt appears that after the initial repetition of -1, the sequence decreases by 1 for each subsequent term. \n\nTherefore, the next term after -3 should be -3 - 1 = -4.\n\nLet's confirm this by generating the next term using a simple Python script:\n\n```python\nsequence = [-1, -1, -2, -3]\nnext_term = sequence[-1] - 1\nprint(next_term)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm our reasoning.",
    "The code execution confirms our reasoning that the next term in the sequence is -4. Therefore, the value of \"?\" in the sequence -1, -1, -2, -3, ? is:\n\n<<<-4>>>"
