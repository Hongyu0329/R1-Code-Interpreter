    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence and determine the next number.\n\nThe given sequence is: -4, -14, -24, -34, -44, -54.\n\nLet's analyze the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n- The difference between -4 and -14 is -10.\n- The difference between -14 and -24 is -10.\n- The difference between -24 and -34 is -10.\n- The difference between -34 and -44 is -10.\n- The difference between -44 and -54 is -10.\n\nThe pattern is that each term is 10 less than the previous term. Therefore, to find the next term in the sequence, we subtract 10 from the last term, -54.\n\nLet's calculate the next term:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the next term in the sequence\nlast_term = -54\ndifference = -10\nnext_term = last_term + difference\nprint(next_term)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the next term in the sequence.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the next term in the sequence. Based on the pattern identified, each term is 10 less than the previous term. Therefore, the next term after -54 is -64.\n\nThus, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is:\n\n<<<-64>>>"
