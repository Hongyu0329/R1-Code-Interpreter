    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence of numbers: 10, 2, -6, -14, -22, -30, and then determine the next number in the sequence.\n\nLet's analyze the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n1. \\(2 - 10 = -8\\)\n2. \\(-6 - 2 = -8\\)\n3. \\(-14 - (-6) = -8\\)\n4. \\(-22 - (-14) = -8\\)\n5. \\(-30 - (-22) = -8\\)\n\nThe difference between each consecutive term is consistently \\(-8\\). This indicates that the sequence is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of \\(-8\\).\n\nTo find the next term in the sequence, we subtract 8 from the last known term, which is \\(-30\\).\n\nLet's calculate this using a simple Python script:\n\n```python\n# Given sequence\nsequence = [10, 2, -6, -14, -22, -30]\n\n# Common difference\ncommon_difference = -8\n\n# Calculate the next term\nnext_term = sequence[-1] + common_difference\n\n# Output the next term\nprint(next_term)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the next term in the sequence.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the next term in the sequence. Based on the arithmetic sequence with a common difference of \\(-8\\), the next term after \\(-30\\) is \\(-38\\).\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is:\n\n<<<-38>>>"
