    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the given sequence: -10, 10, -10, 10, -10, 10, -10, ?.\n\nLet's analyze the sequence:\n\n1. The sequence alternates between -10 and 10.\n2. The pattern is consistent: -10, 10, -10, 10, -10, 10, -10.\n\nBased on this pattern, the next number in the sequence should be 10, as the sequence alternates between -10 and 10.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is 10.\n\n<<<10>>>"
