    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence. The sequence given is:\n\n-8, -8, -16, -24, -40, -64, -104, -168, ?\n\nLet's analyze the differences between consecutive terms to see if there's a pattern:\n\n1. -8 to -8: difference = 0\n2. -8 to -16: difference = -8\n3. -16 to -24: difference = -8\n4. -24 to -40: difference = -16\n5. -40 to -64: difference = -24\n6. -64 to -104: difference = -40\n7. -104 to -168: difference = -64\n\nThe differences between consecutive terms are: 0, -8, -8, -16, -24, -40, -64.\n\nNow, let's look at the differences between these differences:\n\n1. 0 to -8: difference = -8\n2. -8 to -8: difference = 0\n3. -8 to -16: difference = -8\n4. -16 to -24: difference = -8\n5. -24 to -40: difference = -16\n6. -40 to -64: difference = -24\n\nThe second-level differences are: -8, 0, -8, -8, -16, -24.\n\nIt seems like the second-level differences are decreasing by a pattern of -8, 0, -8, -8, -16, -24. Let's see if this pattern continues.\n\nTo find the next term in the sequence, we need to find the next first-level difference and add it to the last term (-168).\n\nLet's calculate the next first-level difference by continuing the pattern of second-level differences:\n\n- The last second-level difference is -24.\n- If we assume the pattern continues, the next second-level difference would be -32 (since -24 - 8 = -32).\n\nNow, let's calculate the next first-level difference:\n\n- The last first-level difference is -64.\n- The next first-level difference would be -64 - 32 = -96.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the next term in the sequence:\n\n- The last term is -168.\n- The next term would be -168 + (-96) = -264.\n\nLet's confirm this calculation with a Python script to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the sequence\nsequence = [-8, -8, -16, -24, -40, -64, -104, -168]\n\n# Calculate the first-level differences\nfirst_level_differences = [sequence[i] - sequence[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(sequence))]\n\n# Calculate the second-level differences\nsecond_level_differences = [first_level_differences[i] - first_level_differences[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(first_level_differences))]\n\n# Calculate the next second-level difference\nnext_second_level_difference = second_level_differences[-1] - 8\n\n# Calculate the next first-level difference\nnext_first_level_difference = first_level_differences[-1] + next_second_level_difference\n\n# Calculate the next term in the sequence\nnext_term = sequence[-1] + next_first_level_difference\n\n# Output the next term\nprint(next_term)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the value of the next term in the sequence.",
    "The code execution confirms our manual calculation. The next term in the sequence is -264. Therefore, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is:\n\n<<<-264>>>"
