    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the given sequence: 10, 10, 20, 30, 50, 80, 130, ?. \n\nLet's analyze the sequence:\n\n1. The first two numbers are both 10.\n2. The third number is 20, which is the sum of the first two numbers (10 + 10).\n3. The fourth number is 30, which is the sum of the second and third numbers (10 + 20).\n4. The fifth number is 50, which is the sum of the third and fourth numbers (20 + 30).\n5. The sixth number is 80, which is the sum of the fourth and fifth numbers (30 + 50).\n6. The seventh number is 130, which is the sum of the fifth and sixth numbers (50 + 80).\n\nFrom this pattern, it appears that each number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding numbers. This is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but it starts with two 10s instead of 0 and 1.\n\nTo find the next number in the sequence, we need to add the sixth and seventh numbers (80 + 130).\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define the sequence\nsequence = [10, 10, 20, 30, 50, 80, 130]\n\n# Calculate the next number in the sequence\nnext_number = sequence[-1] + sequence[-2]\n\n# Output the result\nprint(next_number)\n```\n\nThe code will calculate the next number in the sequence by adding the last two numbers. Let's execute the code to find the value of \"?\".",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the next number in the sequence. Based on the pattern identified, the next number is the sum of the last two numbers in the sequence, which are 80 and 130. Therefore, the next number is 210.\n\nThus, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is:\n\n<<<210>>>"
