    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence and determine the next number. The sequence given is:\n\n1, -2, -6, -10, -14, ?\n\nLet's analyze the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n- The difference between -2 and 1 is -3.\n- The difference between -6 and -2 is -4.\n- The difference between -10 and -6 is -4.\n- The difference between -14 and -10 is -4.\n\nWe can see that after the first term, the difference between each consecutive term is consistently -4. This suggests that the sequence is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of -4, starting from the second term.\n\nTo find the next term in the sequence, we can subtract 4 from the last known term, -14.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Given sequence\nsequence = [1, -2, -6, -10, -14]\n\n# Calculate the next term\nnext_term = sequence[-1] - 4\n\n# Output the next term\nprint(next_term)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the value of the next term in the sequence.",
    "The code execution confirms that the next term in the sequence is -18. Therefore, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is:\n\n<<<-18>>>"
