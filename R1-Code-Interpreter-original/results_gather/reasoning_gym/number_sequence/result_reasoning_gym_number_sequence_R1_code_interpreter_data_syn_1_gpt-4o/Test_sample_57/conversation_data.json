    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the given sequence: 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, and determine the next number.\n\nLet's analyze the sequence:\n\n1. 8 to 16: The difference is 8.\n2. 16 to 32: The difference is 16.\n3. 32 to 64: The difference is 32.\n4. 64 to 128: The difference is 64.\n\nWe can observe that each number is double the previous number. This suggests that the sequence is a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 2 to get the next term.\n\nTo find the next number in the sequence, we multiply the last number, 128, by 2.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Given sequence\nsequence = [8, 16, 32, 64, 128]\n\n# Calculate the next number in the sequence\nnext_number = sequence[-1] * 2\n\n# Output the result\nprint(next_number)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the next number in the sequence.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the next number in the sequence. Based on the pattern identified, each number is double the previous one. Therefore, the next number after 128 is 256.\n\n<<<256>>>"
