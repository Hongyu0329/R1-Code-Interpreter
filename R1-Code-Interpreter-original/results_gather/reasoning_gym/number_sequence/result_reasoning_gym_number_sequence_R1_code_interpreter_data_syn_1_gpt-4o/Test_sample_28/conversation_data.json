    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence. The sequence given is: -6, -14, -28, -50, -86, ?\n\nLet's analyze the differences between consecutive terms to see if there's a pattern:\n\n1. Difference between -14 and -6: \\(-14 - (-6) = -8\\)\n2. Difference between -28 and -14: \\(-28 - (-14) = -14\\)\n3. Difference between -50 and -28: \\(-50 - (-28) = -22\\)\n4. Difference between -86 and -50: \\(-86 - (-50) = -36\\)\n\nThe differences are: -8, -14, -22, -36.\n\nLet's analyze the differences of these differences:\n\n1. Difference between -14 and -8: \\(-14 - (-8) = -6\\)\n2. Difference between -22 and -14: \\(-22 - (-14) = -8\\)\n3. Difference between -36 and -22: \\(-36 - (-22) = -14\\)\n\nThe second-level differences are: -6, -8, -14.\n\nThe second-level differences themselves seem to be increasing, but let's check if there's a pattern. The differences of these differences are:\n\n1. Difference between -8 and -6: \\(-8 - (-6) = -2\\)\n2. Difference between -14 and -8: \\(-14 - (-8) = -6\\)\n\nThe third-level differences are: -2, -6.\n\nThe third-level differences are not constant, but they suggest a pattern of increasing differences. Let's assume the next difference in the second-level differences follows a similar pattern. \n\nTo find the next term in the sequence, we need to find the next first-level difference and add it to the last known term (-86).\n\nLet's calculate the next first-level difference and the next term in the sequence using Python:\n\n```python\n# Initial sequence\nsequence = [-6, -14, -28, -50, -86]\n\n# Calculate first-level differences\nfirst_level_differences = [sequence[i] - sequence[i-1] for i in range(1, len(sequence))]\n\n# Calculate second-level differences\nsecond_level_differences = [first_level_differences[i] - first_level_differences[i-1] for i in range(1, len(first_level_differences))]\n\n# Calculate third-level differences\nthird_level_differences = [second_level_differences[i] - second_level_differences[i-1] for i in range(1, len(second_level_differences))]\n\n# Assume the next third-level difference follows the pattern\nnext_third_level_difference = third_level_differences[-1] - 4  # Assuming a pattern of decreasing by 4\n\n# Calculate the next second-level difference\nnext_second_level_difference = second_level_differences[-1] + next_third_level_difference\n\n# Calculate the next first-level difference\nnext_first_level_difference = first_level_differences[-1] + next_second_level_difference\n\n# Calculate the next term in the sequence\nnext_term = sequence[-1] + next_first_level_difference\n\nprint(next_term)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the next term in the sequence.",
    "The code execution has provided the next term in the sequence as -146. Based on the pattern of differences and the calculations performed, the next term in the sequence is indeed -146.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is:\n\n<<<-146>>>"
