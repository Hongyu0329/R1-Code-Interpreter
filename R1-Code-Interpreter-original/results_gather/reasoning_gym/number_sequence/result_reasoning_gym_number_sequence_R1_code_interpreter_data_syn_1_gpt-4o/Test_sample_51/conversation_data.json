    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the given sequence: 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and then determine the next number in the sequence.\n\nLet's analyze the sequence:\n\n1. The first number is 4.\n2. The second number is 8, which is 4 multiplied by 2.\n3. The third number is 16, which is 8 multiplied by 2.\n4. The fourth number is 32, which is 16 multiplied by 2.\n5. The fifth number is 64, which is 32 multiplied by 2.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can see that each number in the sequence is obtained by multiplying the previous number by 2. This is a geometric sequence where each term is double the previous term.\n\nTo find the next number in the sequence, we need to multiply the last number, 64, by 2.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define the last known number in the sequence\nlast_number = 64\n\n# Calculate the next number in the sequence\nnext_number = last_number * 2\n\n# Output the result\nprint(next_number)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the next number in the sequence.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the next number in the sequence. Based on the pattern identified, each number is double the previous one. Therefore, the next number after 64 is 128.\n\n<<<128>>>"
