    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence. The sequence given is: -1, -4, -8, -15, -26, -44, -73, ?\n\nLet's analyze the differences between consecutive terms to see if there's a pattern:\n\n1. Difference between -4 and -1: -4 - (-1) = -3\n2. Difference between -8 and -4: -8 - (-4) = -4\n3. Difference between -15 and -8: -15 - (-8) = -7\n4. Difference between -26 and -15: -26 - (-15) = -11\n5. Difference between -44 and -26: -44 - (-26) = -18\n6. Difference between -73 and -44: -73 - (-44) = -29\n\nThe differences are: -3, -4, -7, -11, -18, -29\n\nNow, let's look at the differences between these differences:\n\n1. Difference between -4 and -3: -4 - (-3) = -1\n2. Difference between -7 and -4: -7 - (-4) = -3\n3. Difference between -11 and -7: -11 - (-7) = -4\n4. Difference between -18 and -11: -18 - (-11) = -7\n5. Difference between -29 and -18: -29 - (-18) = -11\n\nThe second-level differences are: -1, -3, -4, -7, -11\n\nThe pattern in the second-level differences seems to follow the same pattern as the first-level differences. This suggests that the differences are increasing in a pattern similar to the Fibonacci sequence, where each term is the sum of the two preceding ones.\n\nTo find the next difference in the sequence, we can add the last two differences: -7 and -11.\n\nLet's calculate the next difference and the next term in the sequence using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Initial sequence\nsequence = [-1, -4, -8, -15, -26, -44, -73]\n\n# Calculate the differences\ndifferences = [sequence[i] - sequence[i-1] for i in range(1, len(sequence))]\n\n# Calculate the second-level differences\nsecond_level_differences = [differences[i] - differences[i-1] for i in range(1, len(differences))]\n\n# Calculate the next second-level difference\nnext_second_level_difference = second_level_differences[-1] + second_level_differences[-2]\n\n# Calculate the next first-level difference\nnext_difference = differences[-1] + next_second_level_difference\n\n# Calculate the next term in the sequence\nnext_term = sequence[-1] + next_difference\n\nprint(next_term)\n```\n\nThe code will calculate the next term in the sequence based on the identified pattern.",
    "The code execution output indicates that the next term in the sequence is -120. Therefore, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is:\n\n<<<-120>>>"
