    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the given sequence: 10, -20, 40, -80, 160, -320, and then determine the next number in the sequence.\n\nLet's analyze the sequence:\n\n1. The first term is 10.\n2. The second term is -20, which is -2 times the first term (10).\n3. The third term is 40, which is -2 times the second term (-20).\n4. The fourth term is -80, which is -2 times the third term (40).\n5. The fifth term is 160, which is -2 times the fourth term (-80).\n6. The sixth term is -320, which is -2 times the fifth term (160).\n\nFrom this, we can see that each term is -2 times the previous term. This is a geometric sequence with a common ratio of -2.\n\nTo find the next term in the sequence, we multiply the last known term (-320) by -2.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Given sequence\nsequence = [10, -20, 40, -80, 160, -320]\n\n# Calculate the next term\nnext_term = sequence[-1] * -2\n\n# Output the next term\nprint(next_term)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the next term in the sequence.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the next term in the sequence. Based on the pattern identified, each term is -2 times the previous term. Therefore, the next term after -320 is 640.\n\nThus, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is:\n\n<<<640>>>"
