    "The sequence given is: -1, -1, -2, -3, -5, -8, -13, -21, ?\n\nThis sequence resembles the Fibonacci sequence, but with negative numbers. In a typical Fibonacci sequence, each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. Here, it seems that each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers, but with negative values.\n\nLet's verify this pattern:\n\n- -1 + (-1) = -2\n- -1 + (-2) = -3\n- -2 + (-3) = -5\n- -3 + (-5) = -8\n- -5 + (-8) = -13\n- -8 + (-13) = -21\n\nThe pattern holds. Therefore, the next number should be the sum of the last two numbers in the sequence: -13 and -21.\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the next number in the sequence\nprevious_number_1 = -13\nprevious_number_2 = -21\nnext_number = previous_number_1 + previous_number_2\nprint(next_number)\n```\n\nExecuting the code will give us the next number in the sequence.",
    "The code executed correctly and calculated the next number in the sequence. Based on the pattern of the sequence, the next number is the sum of the last two numbers, -13 and -21, which is -34.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is:\n\n<<<-34>>>"
