    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence: -10, -10, -20, -30, ?. \n\nLet's analyze the sequence:\n\n1. The first term is -10.\n2. The second term is also -10.\n3. The third term is -20.\n4. The fourth term is -30.\n\nWe need to find the pattern or rule that governs the sequence to determine the next term.\n\nObserving the sequence:\n- The first two terms are the same: -10, -10.\n- The third term is -20, which is -10 - 10.\n- The fourth term is -30, which is -20 - 10.\n\nIt seems like after the first two terms, each subsequent term is obtained by subtracting 10 from the previous term.\n\nLet's verify this pattern:\n- Start with -10, -10.\n- The third term: -10 - 10 = -20.\n- The fourth term: -20 - 10 = -30.\n\nFollowing this pattern, the next term should be:\n- The fifth term: -30 - 10 = -40.\n\nThus, the value of \"?\" should be -40.\n\nLet's confirm this by writing a small Python script to compute the next term based on the identified pattern.\n\n```python\n# Initial sequence\nsequence = [-10, -10, -20, -30]\n\n# Calculate the next term based on the pattern\nnext_term = sequence[-1] - 10\n\n# Output the next term\nprint(next_term)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to confirm our reasoning.",
    "The code execution confirms our reasoning that the next term in the sequence is -40. Therefore, the value of \"?\" is:\n\n<<<-40>>>"
