    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the given sequence: -1, -2, -4, -8, -16, -32, -64, ?. \n\nObserving the sequence, we can see that each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by 2. This is a geometric sequence where each term is double the previous one.\n\nLet's verify this pattern:\n- -1 * 2 = -2\n- -2 * 2 = -4\n- -4 * 2 = -8\n- -8 * 2 = -16\n- -16 * 2 = -32\n- -32 * 2 = -64\n\nFollowing this pattern, the next term should be -64 * 2.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Given sequence\nsequence = [-1, -2, -4, -8, -16, -32, -64]\n\n# Calculate the next term\nnext_term = sequence[-1] * 2\n\n# Output the next term\nprint(next_term)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the value of \"?\".",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the next term in the sequence. Based on the pattern of multiplying each term by 2, the next term after -64 is -128.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is:\n\n<<<-128>>>"
