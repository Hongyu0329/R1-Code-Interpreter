    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that governs the sequence of numbers: 6, 13, 26, 46, 79, and then determine the next number in the sequence.\n\nLet's analyze the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n- Difference between 13 and 6: 13 - 6 = 7\n- Difference between 26 and 13: 26 - 13 = 13\n- Difference between 46 and 26: 46 - 26 = 20\n- Difference between 79 and 46: 79 - 46 = 33\n\nThe differences are: 7, 13, 20, 33.\n\nNow, let's look at the differences between these differences:\n\n- Difference between 13 and 7: 13 - 7 = 6\n- Difference between 20 and 13: 20 - 13 = 7\n- Difference between 33 and 20: 33 - 20 = 13\n\nThe second-level differences are: 6, 7, 13.\n\nIt seems like the second-level differences are increasing in a pattern. Let's see if this pattern continues by calculating the next difference:\n\n- Next difference after 13: 13 + 6 = 19\n\nNow, let's calculate the next first-level difference:\n\n- Next first-level difference: 33 + 19 = 52\n\nFinally, let's calculate the next term in the sequence:\n\n- Next term: 79 + 52 = 131\n\nLet's verify this by writing a Python script to compute the next term in the sequence.\n\n```python\n# Initial sequence\nsequence = [6, 13, 26, 46, 79]\n\n# Calculate first-level differences\nfirst_level_differences = [sequence[i] - sequence[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(sequence))]\n\n# Calculate second-level differences\nsecond_level_differences = [first_level_differences[i] - first_level_differences[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(first_level_differences))]\n\n# Calculate the next second-level difference\nnext_second_level_difference = second_level_differences[-1] + (second_level_differences[-1] - second_level_differences[-2])\n\n# Calculate the next first-level difference\nnext_first_level_difference = first_level_differences[-1] + next_second_level_difference\n\n# Calculate the next term in the sequence\nnext_term = sequence[-1] + next_first_level_difference\n\nprint(next_term)\n```\n\nThe code will compute the next term in the sequence based on the identified pattern. Let's execute it to find the value of \"?\".",
    "The code execution confirms that the next term in the sequence is 131. Therefore, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is:\n\n<<<131>>>"
