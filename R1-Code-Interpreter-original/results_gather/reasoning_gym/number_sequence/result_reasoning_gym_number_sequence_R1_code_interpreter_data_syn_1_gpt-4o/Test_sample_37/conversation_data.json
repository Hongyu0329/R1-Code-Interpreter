    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence of numbers: 8, 8, 16, 24, 40, 64, 104, and then determine the next number in the sequence.\n\nLet's analyze the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n- Difference between 8 and 8 is 0.\n- Difference between 8 and 16 is 8.\n- Difference between 16 and 24 is 8.\n- Difference between 24 and 40 is 16.\n- Difference between 40 and 64 is 24.\n- Difference between 64 and 104 is 40.\n\nThe differences are: 0, 8, 8, 16, 24, 40.\n\nNow, let's analyze the differences between these differences:\n\n- Difference between 0 and 8 is 8.\n- Difference between 8 and 8 is 0.\n- Difference between 8 and 16 is 8.\n- Difference between 16 and 24 is 8.\n- Difference between 24 and 40 is 16.\n\nThe second-level differences are: 8, 0, 8, 8, 16.\n\nIt seems like the second-level differences are increasing by a pattern: 8, 0, 8, 8, 16. Let's see if this pattern continues or if there's a more complex rule.\n\nTo predict the next number, let's calculate the next difference in the sequence and add it to the last number in the sequence.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the next number in the sequence\nsequence = [8, 8, 16, 24, 40, 64, 104]\ndifferences = [sequence[i] - sequence[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(sequence))]\nsecond_level_differences = [differences[i] - differences[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(differences))]\n\n# Predict the next second-level difference\nnext_second_level_difference = second_level_differences[-1] + (second_level_differences[-1] - second_level_differences[-2])\n\n# Predict the next first-level difference\nnext_difference = differences[-1] + next_second_level_difference\n\n# Predict the next number in the sequence\nnext_number = sequence[-1] + next_difference\n\nprint(next_number)\n```\n\nThe code will calculate the next number in the sequence based on the identified pattern. Let's execute it to find the result.",
    "The code execution indicates that the next number in the sequence is 168. Based on the pattern analysis and calculations, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is:\n\n<<<168>>>"
