    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the given sequence of numbers: 8, 14, 20, 26, 32, 38, 44, and then determine the next number in the sequence.\n\nFirst, let's examine the differences between consecutive numbers in the sequence:\n\n- 14 - 8 = 6\n- 20 - 14 = 6\n- 26 - 20 = 6\n- 32 - 26 = 6\n- 38 - 32 = 6\n- 44 - 38 = 6\n\nThe difference between each consecutive number is 6. This indicates that the sequence is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6.\n\nTo find the next number in the sequence, we simply add 6 to the last number in the sequence, which is 44.\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the next number in the sequence\nlast_number = 44\ncommon_difference = 6\nnext_number = last_number + common_difference\nprint(next_number)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the next number in the sequence.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the next number in the sequence is 50. Therefore, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is:\n\n<<<50>>>"
