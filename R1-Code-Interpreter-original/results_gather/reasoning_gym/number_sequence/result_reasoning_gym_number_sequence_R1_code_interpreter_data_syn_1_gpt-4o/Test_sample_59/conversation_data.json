    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence: -4, -4, -8, -12, -20, -32, -52, ?. \n\nLet's analyze the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n1. -4 to -4: difference = 0\n2. -4 to -8: difference = -4\n3. -8 to -12: difference = -4\n4. -12 to -20: difference = -8\n5. -20 to -32: difference = -12\n6. -32 to -52: difference = -20\n\nThe differences between consecutive terms are: 0, -4, -4, -8, -12, -20.\n\nNow, let's analyze the differences between these differences:\n\n1. 0 to -4: difference = -4\n2. -4 to -4: difference = 0\n3. -4 to -8: difference = -4\n4. -8 to -12: difference = -4\n5. -12 to -20: difference = -8\n\nThe second-level differences are: -4, 0, -4, -4, -8.\n\nIt seems that the second-level differences are not constant, but let's see if there's a pattern. The differences are decreasing by 0, -4, and -4, which suggests a pattern of decreasing by 4 every two steps.\n\nLet's use this pattern to predict the next difference:\n\n- The last second-level difference is -8.\n- If we follow the pattern, the next second-level difference should be -8 - 4 = -12.\n\nNow, let's calculate the next first-level difference:\n\n- The last first-level difference is -20.\n- The next first-level difference should be -20 + (-12) = -32.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the next term in the sequence:\n\n- The last term in the sequence is -52.\n- The next term should be -52 + (-32) = -84.\n\nLet's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Initial sequence\nsequence = [-4, -4, -8, -12, -20, -32, -52]\n\n# Calculate first-level differences\nfirst_level_differences = [sequence[i] - sequence[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(sequence))]\n\n# Calculate second-level differences\nsecond_level_differences = [first_level_differences[i] - first_level_differences[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(first_level_differences))]\n\n# Predict the next second-level difference\nnext_second_level_difference = second_level_differences[-1] - 4\n\n# Predict the next first-level difference\nnext_first_level_difference = first_level_differences[-1] + next_second_level_difference\n\n# Predict the next term in the sequence\nnext_term = sequence[-1] + next_first_level_difference\n\nprint(next_term)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the value of \"?\".",
    "The code execution confirms that the next term in the sequence is -84. Therefore, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is:\n\n<<<-84>>>"
