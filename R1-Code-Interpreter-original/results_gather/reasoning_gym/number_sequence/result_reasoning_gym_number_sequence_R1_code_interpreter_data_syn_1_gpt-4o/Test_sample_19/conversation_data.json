    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence of numbers: 7, 14, 28, 56, 112, and then determine the next number in the sequence.\n\nLet's analyze the sequence:\n\n1. The first number is 7.\n2. The second number is 14, which is 7 multiplied by 2.\n3. The third number is 28, which is 14 multiplied by 2.\n4. The fourth number is 56, which is 28 multiplied by 2.\n5. The fifth number is 112, which is 56 multiplied by 2.\n\nFrom this analysis, it appears that each number in the sequence is obtained by multiplying the previous number by 2. Therefore, the sequence follows a pattern of doubling each number to get the next one.\n\nTo find the next number in the sequence, we need to multiply the last number, 112, by 2.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define the last known number in the sequence\nlast_number = 112\n\n# Calculate the next number by multiplying the last number by 2\nnext_number = last_number * 2\n\n# Output the result\nprint(next_number)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the next number in the sequence.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the next number in the sequence. Based on the pattern of multiplying each number by 2, the next number after 112 is 224.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is:\n\n<<<224>>>"
