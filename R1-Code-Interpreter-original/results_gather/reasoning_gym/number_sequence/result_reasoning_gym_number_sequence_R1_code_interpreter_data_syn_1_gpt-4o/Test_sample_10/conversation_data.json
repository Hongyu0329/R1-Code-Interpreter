    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the given sequence of numbers: 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 192, 384.\n\nLet's analyze the sequence:\n\n1. 3 to 6: The difference is 3, which is 3 * 1.\n2. 6 to 12: The difference is 6, which is 6 * 1.\n3. 12 to 24: The difference is 12, which is 12 * 1.\n4. 24 to 48: The difference is 24, which is 24 * 1.\n5. 48 to 96: The difference is 48, which is 48 * 1.\n6. 96 to 192: The difference is 96, which is 96 * 1.\n7. 192 to 384: The difference is 192, which is 192 * 1.\n\nFrom this, we can see that each number is double the previous number. Therefore, the pattern is a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 2 to get the next term.\n\nTo find the next number in the sequence, we multiply the last number, 384, by 2.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Given sequence\nsequence = [3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 192, 384]\n\n# Calculate the next number in the sequence\nnext_number = sequence[-1] * 2\n\n# Output the result\nprint(next_number)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the next number in the sequence.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the next number in the sequence. Based on the pattern identified, each number is double the previous one. Therefore, the next number after 384 is 768.\n\nThus, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is:\n\n<<<768>>>"
