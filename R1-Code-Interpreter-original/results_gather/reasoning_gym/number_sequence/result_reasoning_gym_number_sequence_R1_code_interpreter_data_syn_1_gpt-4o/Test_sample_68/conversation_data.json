    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence: -3, -6, -12, -24, -48, -96, and then determine the next number in the sequence.\n\nLet's analyze the sequence:\n\n1. From -3 to -6: The difference is -3.\n2. From -6 to -12: The difference is -6.\n3. From -12 to -24: The difference is -12.\n4. From -24 to -48: The difference is -24.\n5. From -48 to -96: The difference is -48.\n\nWe can observe that each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by 2. This is a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 2.\n\nTo find the next term in the sequence, we multiply the last known term (-96) by 2.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define the last known term\nlast_term = -96\n\n# Calculate the next term by multiplying by the common ratio\nnext_term = last_term * 2\n\n# Output the result\nprint(next_term)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the next term in the sequence.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is -192. This confirms that the next term in the sequence is -192.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is:\n\n<<<-192>>>"
