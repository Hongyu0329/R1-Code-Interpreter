    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence of numbers: -9, -3, -10, -6, -12, -9, -15, and then determine the next number in the sequence.\n\nLet's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the differences between consecutive terms:**\n   - From -9 to -3: difference is +6\n   - From -3 to -10: difference is -7\n   - From -10 to -6: difference is +4\n   - From -6 to -12: difference is -6\n   - From -12 to -9: difference is +3\n   - From -9 to -15: difference is -6\n\n2. **Look for a pattern in the differences:**\n   - The differences are: +6, -7, +4, -6, +3, -6\n\n3. **Check for a repeating pattern:**\n   - The differences seem to alternate between positive and negative values, but there is no simple arithmetic progression or consistent pattern in the differences themselves.\n\n4. **Consider the possibility of a more complex pattern:**\n   - The sequence might involve a more complex rule or a combination of operations.\n\nGiven the differences, let's try to predict the next difference and thus the next number in the sequence. The last difference was -6, and before that, the differences were +3 and -6. It seems like the sequence might be alternating between a positive and a negative difference, with the negative difference being -6.\n\nLet's assume the next difference follows the pattern of alternating differences, and calculate the next number in the sequence:\n\n- The last number in the sequence is -15.\n- If the pattern continues with a positive difference, the next difference might be +2 (since the positive differences seem to be decreasing by 1 each time: +6, +4, +3).\n\nLet's calculate the next number:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the next number in the sequence\nlast_number = -15\nnext_difference = 2  # Assuming the next positive difference is +2\nnext_number = last_number + next_difference\nprint(next_number)\n```\n\nExecuting the code will give us the next number in the sequence.",
    "The code execution output indicates that the next number in the sequence is -13. Therefore, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is:\n\n<<<-13>>>"
