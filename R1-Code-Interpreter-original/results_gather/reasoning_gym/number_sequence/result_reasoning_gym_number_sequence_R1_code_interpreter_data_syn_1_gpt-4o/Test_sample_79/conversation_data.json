    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence: 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 192, ?. \n\nLet's analyze the sequence:\n\n1. 3 to 6: The difference is 3.\n2. 6 to 12: The difference is 6.\n3. 12 to 24: The difference is 12.\n4. 24 to 48: The difference is 24.\n5. 48 to 96: The difference is 48.\n6. 96 to 192: The difference is 96.\n\nWe can observe that each term is double the previous term. This suggests that the sequence is a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 2 to get the next term.\n\nTo find the next term after 192, we multiply 192 by 2.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define the last known term\nlast_term = 192\n\n# Calculate the next term by multiplying by 2\nnext_term = last_term * 2\n\n# Output the result\nprint(next_term)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the next term in the sequence.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the next term in the sequence. Based on the pattern identified, each term is double the previous term. Therefore, the next term after 192 is 384.\n\nThus, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is:\n\n<<<384>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
