    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence: -7, -8, -8, -8, -8, -8, -8, ?. \n\nLet's analyze the sequence:\n\n1. The first number is -7.\n2. The subsequent numbers are all -8.\n\nThe sequence seems to start with -7 and then continues with -8 repeatedly. There is no apparent change or progression in the numbers after the first one. \n\nGiven this pattern, it is reasonable to assume that the sequence continues with -8. Therefore, the value of \"?\" is likely -8.\n\nLet's confirm this by considering the sequence logic:\n\n- The first number is distinct, and the rest are the same.\n- The sequence does not show any arithmetic or geometric progression.\n- The repetition of -8 suggests a constant value after the initial -7.\n\nThus, the most logical conclusion is that the sequence continues with -8.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is -8.\n\n<<<-8>>>"
