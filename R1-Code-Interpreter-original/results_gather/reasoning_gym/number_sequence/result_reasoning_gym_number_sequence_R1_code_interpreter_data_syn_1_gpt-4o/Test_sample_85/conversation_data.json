    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence: -6, -6, -12, -18, ?. \n\nLet's analyze the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n1. The difference between the first term (-6) and the second term (-6) is 0.\n2. The difference between the second term (-6) and the third term (-12) is -6.\n3. The difference between the third term (-12) and the fourth term (-18) is -6.\n\nIt seems that after the initial repetition of -6, the sequence decreases by 6 for each subsequent term. \n\nTo find the next term in the sequence, we can continue this pattern by subtracting 6 from the last known term (-18).\n\nLet's calculate this:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Next term} = -18 - 6\n\\]\n\nNow, let's compute this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the sequence\nsequence = [-6, -6, -12, -18]\n\n# Calculate the next term by subtracting 6 from the last term\nnext_term = sequence[-1] - 6\n\n# Output the next term\nprint(next_term)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the next term in the sequence.",
