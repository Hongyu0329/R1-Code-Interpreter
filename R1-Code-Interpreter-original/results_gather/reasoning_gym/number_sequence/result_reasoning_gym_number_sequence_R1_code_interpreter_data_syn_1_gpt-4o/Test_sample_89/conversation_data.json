    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence: -5, -5, -10, -15, -25, -40, ?. \n\nLet's analyze the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n1. The difference between the first term (-5) and the second term (-5) is 0.\n2. The difference between the second term (-5) and the third term (-10) is -5.\n3. The difference between the third term (-10) and the fourth term (-15) is -5.\n4. The difference between the fourth term (-15) and the fifth term (-25) is -10.\n5. The difference between the fifth term (-25) and the sixth term (-40) is -15.\n\nThe differences are: 0, -5, -5, -10, -15.\n\nWe can see that the differences themselves are forming a pattern: 0, -5, -5, -10, -15. The differences are decreasing by 5 each time after the initial 0.\n\nTo find the next term in the sequence, we need to find the next difference. The last difference was -15, so the next difference should be -15 - 5 = -20.\n\nNow, let's calculate the next term in the sequence by adding this difference to the last term (-40):\n\nNext term = -40 + (-20) = -60\n\nTherefore, the next term in the sequence is -60.\n\n<<<-60>>>"
