    "The sequence given is an arithmetic sequence where each term increases by a constant difference. Let's analyze the sequence:\n\n- The first term is 0.\n- The second term is 2.\n- The third term is 4.\n- The fourth term is 6.\n- The fifth term is 8.\n- The sixth term is 10.\n\nThe difference between consecutive terms is:\n\n- 2 - 0 = 2\n- 4 - 2 = 2\n- 6 - 4 = 2\n- 8 - 6 = 2\n- 10 - 8 = 2\n\nThe common difference is 2. This means the sequence is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2.\n\nTo find the next term in the sequence, we add the common difference to the last known term:\n\n10 + 2 = 12\n\nTherefore, the next term in the sequence is 12.\n\n<<<12>>>"
