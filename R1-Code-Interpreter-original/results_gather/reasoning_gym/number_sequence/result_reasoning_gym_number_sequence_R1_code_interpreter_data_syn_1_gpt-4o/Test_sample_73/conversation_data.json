    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence of numbers: 9, 18, 36, 72, 144, and then determine the next number in the sequence.\n\nLet's analyze the sequence:\n\n1. The first number is 9.\n2. The second number is 18, which is 9 multiplied by 2.\n3. The third number is 36, which is 18 multiplied by 2.\n4. The fourth number is 72, which is 36 multiplied by 2.\n5. The fifth number is 144, which is 72 multiplied by 2.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can see that each number in the sequence is obtained by multiplying the previous number by 2. This is a geometric sequence where each term is twice the previous term.\n\nTo find the next number in the sequence, we multiply the last known number (144) by 2.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define the last known number in the sequence\nlast_number = 144\n\n# Calculate the next number in the sequence\nnext_number = last_number * 2\n\n# Output the result\nprint(next_number)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the next number in the sequence.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the next number in the sequence. Based on the pattern identified, each number is twice the previous one. Therefore, the next number after 144 is 288.\n\n<<<288>>>"
