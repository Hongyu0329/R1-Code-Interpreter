    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the given sequence: 1, -3, 9, -27, 81, -243, ?. \n\nLet's analyze the sequence:\n\n1. The first term is 1.\n2. The second term is -3.\n3. The third term is 9.\n4. The fourth term is -27.\n5. The fifth term is 81.\n6. The sixth term is -243.\n\nObserving the sequence, we can see that each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by -3. This is a geometric sequence with a common ratio of -3.\n\nLet's verify this:\n\n- \\(1 \\times (-3) = -3\\)\n- \\(-3 \\times (-3) = 9\\)\n- \\(9 \\times (-3) = -27\\)\n- \\(-27 \\times (-3) = 81\\)\n- \\(81 \\times (-3) = -243\\)\n\nThe pattern holds true. Therefore, to find the next term, we multiply the last known term (-243) by -3.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Given sequence\nsequence = [1, -3, 9, -27, 81, -243]\n\n# Calculate the next term\nnext_term = sequence[-1] * -3\n\n# Output the next term\nprint(next_term)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the value of \"?\".",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the next term in the sequence. Based on the pattern identified, the next term is obtained by multiplying the last term (-243) by -3, resulting in 729.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is:\n\n<<<729>>>"
