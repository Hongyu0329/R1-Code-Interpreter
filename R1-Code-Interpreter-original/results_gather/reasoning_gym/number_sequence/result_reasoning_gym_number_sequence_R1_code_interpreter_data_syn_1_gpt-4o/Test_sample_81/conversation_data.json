    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that governs the sequence of numbers: 3, 8, 16, 29, 50, and then determine the next number in the sequence.\n\nLet's analyze the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n- Difference between 8 and 3: \\(8 - 3 = 5\\)\n- Difference between 16 and 8: \\(16 - 8 = 8\\)\n- Difference between 29 and 16: \\(29 - 16 = 13\\)\n- Difference between 50 and 29: \\(50 - 29 = 21\\)\n\nThe differences themselves form a sequence: 5, 8, 13, 21. This sequence resembles the Fibonacci sequence, where each term is the sum of the two preceding ones. Let's verify:\n\n- \\(5 + 8 = 13\\)\n- \\(8 + 13 = 21\\)\n\nThe next difference should be \\(13 + 21 = 34\\).\n\nNow, we can find the next term in the original sequence by adding this difference to the last known term:\n\n- Next term = \\(50 + 34 = 84\\)\n\nThus, the next number in the sequence is 84.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script to ensure our calculations are correct.\n\n```python\n# Define the initial sequence\nsequence = [3, 8, 16, 29, 50]\n\n# Calculate the differences\ndifferences = [sequence[i] - sequence[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(sequence))]\n\n# Calculate the next difference using the pattern of differences\nnext_difference = differences[-1] + differences[-2]\n\n# Calculate the next term in the sequence\nnext_term = sequence[-1] + next_difference\n\n# Output the next term\nprint(next_term)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we should get the next term in the sequence. Let's see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and confirmed our manual calculation. The next number in the sequence is indeed 84.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is:\n\n<<<84>>>"
