    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence of numbers: 5, 5, 10, 15, 25, 40, 65, and then determine the next number in the sequence.\n\nLet's analyze the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n- 5 to 5: difference is 0\n- 5 to 10: difference is 5\n- 10 to 15: difference is 5\n- 15 to 25: difference is 10\n- 25 to 40: difference is 15\n- 40 to 65: difference is 25\n\nThe differences between consecutive terms are: 0, 5, 5, 10, 15, 25.\n\nNow, let's look at the differences between these differences:\n\n- 5 - 0 = 5\n- 5 - 5 = 0\n- 10 - 5 = 5\n- 15 - 10 = 5\n- 25 - 15 = 10\n\nThe second-level differences are: 5, 0, 5, 5, 10.\n\nIt seems like the differences are increasing in a pattern. Let's try to identify the next difference:\n\n- The differences are: 0, 5, 5, 10, 15, 25\n- The second-level differences are: 5, 0, 5, 5, 10\n\nThe second-level differences suggest a pattern of increasing by 5 every two steps. Let's predict the next difference:\n\n- The next second-level difference should be 5 (since it follows the pattern 5, 0, 5, 5, 10, 5)\n- Therefore, the next first-level difference should be 25 + 5 = 30\n\nNow, let's calculate the next term in the sequence:\n\n- The last term is 65\n- The next difference is 30\n- Therefore, the next term is 65 + 30 = 95\n\nThus, the next number in the sequence is 95.\n\n<<<95>>>"
