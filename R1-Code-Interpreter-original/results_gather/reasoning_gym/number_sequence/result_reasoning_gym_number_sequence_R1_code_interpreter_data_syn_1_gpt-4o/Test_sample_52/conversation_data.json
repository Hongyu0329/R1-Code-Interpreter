    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or sequence rule that generates the given numbers: 4, 15, 30, 56, 97. Once we identify the pattern, we can apply it to find the next number in the sequence.\n\nLet's analyze the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n- Difference between 15 and 4: 15 - 4 = 11\n- Difference between 30 and 15: 30 - 15 = 15\n- Difference between 56 and 30: 56 - 30 = 26\n- Difference between 97 and 56: 97 - 56 = 41\n\nThe differences are: 11, 15, 26, 41.\n\nNow, let's analyze the differences between these differences:\n\n- Difference between 15 and 11: 15 - 11 = 4\n- Difference between 26 and 15: 26 - 15 = 11\n- Difference between 41 and 26: 41 - 26 = 15\n\nThe second-level differences are: 4, 11, 15.\n\nThe second-level differences suggest a pattern, but let's verify it by calculating the next difference and the next term in the sequence.\n\nTo find the next difference, we can assume the pattern in the second-level differences continues. Let's calculate the next difference and the next term in the sequence using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Given sequence\nsequence = [4, 15, 30, 56, 97]\n\n# Calculate first-level differences\nfirst_differences = [sequence[i] - sequence[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(sequence))]\n\n# Calculate second-level differences\nsecond_differences = [first_differences[i] - first_differences[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(first_differences))]\n\n# Assume the pattern in second-level differences continues\nnext_second_difference = second_differences[-1] + (second_differences[-1] - second_differences[-2])\n\n# Calculate the next first-level difference\nnext_first_difference = first_differences[-1] + next_second_difference\n\n# Calculate the next term in the sequence\nnext_term = sequence[-1] + next_first_difference\n\nprint(next_term)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to find the next term in the sequence.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the next term in the sequence. Based on the pattern identified through the differences, the next number in the sequence is 157.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is:\n\n<<<157>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
