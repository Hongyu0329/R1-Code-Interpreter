    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the given sequence of numbers: 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320. \n\nLet's analyze the sequence:\n\n1. 20 is 10 multiplied by 2.\n2. 40 is 20 multiplied by 2.\n3. 80 is 40 multiplied by 2.\n4. 160 is 80 multiplied by 2.\n5. 320 is 160 multiplied by 2.\n\nThe pattern here is that each number is obtained by multiplying the previous number by 2. This is a geometric sequence where the common ratio is 2.\n\nTo find the next number in the sequence, we multiply the last number, 320, by 2.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Given sequence\nsequence = [10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320]\n\n# Calculate the next number in the sequence\nnext_number = sequence[-1] * 2\n\n# Output the result\nprint(next_number)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the next number in the sequence.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output as 640. This confirms that the next number in the sequence, following the pattern of multiplying by 2, is 640.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is:\n\n<<<640>>>"
