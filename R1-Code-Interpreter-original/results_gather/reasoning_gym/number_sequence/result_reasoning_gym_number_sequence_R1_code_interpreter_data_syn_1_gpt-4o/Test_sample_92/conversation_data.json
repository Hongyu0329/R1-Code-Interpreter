    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the given sequence: -9, -6, -4, -3, -3, -3, ?. \n\nLet's analyze the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n1. From -9 to -6, the difference is +3.\n2. From -6 to -4, the difference is +2.\n3. From -4 to -3, the difference is +1.\n4. From -3 to -3, the difference is 0.\n5. From -3 to -3, the difference is 0.\n\nThe differences are decreasing by 1 each time until they reach 0, and then they remain constant at 0. \n\nGiven this pattern, the next difference should also be 0, meaning the next term in the sequence should be the same as the previous term.\n\nTherefore, the next term in the sequence is -3.\n\n<<<-3>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    -9, -6, -4, -3, -3, -3, ?\nOutput the value of \"?\" enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the value of \"?\">>>."
