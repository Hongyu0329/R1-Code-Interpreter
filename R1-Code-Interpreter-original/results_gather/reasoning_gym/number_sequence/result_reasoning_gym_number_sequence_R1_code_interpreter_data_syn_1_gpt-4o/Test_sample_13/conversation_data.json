    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the given sequence: -6, 15, -6, 15, ?. \n\nLet's analyze the sequence:\n\n1. The sequence alternates between -6 and 15.\n2. The first term is -6, the second term is 15, the third term is -6, and the fourth term is 15.\n\nFrom this pattern, it appears that the sequence alternates between -6 and 15. Therefore, the next term in the sequence should follow this alternating pattern.\n\nSince the last term given is 15, the next term should be -6.\n\nThus, the value of \"?\" is -6.\n\n<<<-6>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    -6, 15, -6, 15, ?\nOutput the value of \"?\" enclosed within triple angle brackets, like <<<the value of \"?\">>>."
