    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence. Let's analyze the given sequence:\n\n9, 9, 18, 27, 45, 72, 117, 189, ?\n\n1. **Initial Observations**:\n   - The sequence starts with two 9s.\n   - The numbers seem to be increasing, and the differences between consecutive terms might reveal a pattern.\n\n2. **Calculate Differences**:\n   - Let's calculate the differences between consecutive terms to see if there's a pattern:\n     - 9 to 9: 0\n     - 9 to 18: 9\n     - 18 to 27: 9\n     - 27 to 45: 18\n     - 45 to 72: 27\n     - 72 to 117: 45\n     - 117 to 189: 72\n\n3. **Analyze Differences**:\n   - The differences themselves form a sequence: 0, 9, 9, 18, 27, 45, 72.\n   - This sequence of differences seems to follow a pattern similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but with a slight modification.\n\n4. **Fibonacci-like Pattern**:\n   - The differences after the initial 0 and 9 seem to follow a pattern where each term is the sum of the two preceding terms:\n     - 9 = 9\n     - 18 = 9 + 9\n     - 27 = 9 + 18\n     - 45 = 18 + 27\n     - 72 = 27 + 45\n   - The next difference should be 45 + 72 = 117.\n\n5. **Calculate the Next Term**:\n   - The last term in the sequence is 189.\n   - The next term should be 189 + 117.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Given sequence\nsequence = [9, 9, 18, 27, 45, 72, 117, 189]\n\n# Calculate the next difference\nnext_difference = 45 + 72\n\n# Calculate the next term in the sequence\nnext_term = sequence[-1] + next_difference\n\n# Output the next term\nprint(next_term)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the next term in the sequence.",
