    "\nassistant > To find the next number in the sequence, let's first identify the pattern:\n\nThe sequence is: 7, 7, 14, 21, 35, ?\n\n1. The first two numbers are both 7.\n2. The third number is 14, which is 7 + 7.\n3. The fourth number is 21, which is 14 + 7.\n4. The fifth number is 35, which is 21 + 14.\n\nIt seems that each number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding numbers. Let's verify this pattern:\n\n- 14 = 7 + 7\n- 21 = 14 + 7\n- 35 = 21 + 14\n\nFollowing this pattern, the next number should be the sum of the last two numbers in the sequence: 21 and 35.\n\nLet's calculate the next number.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Calculate the next number in the sequence\nsequence = [7, 7, 14, 21, 35]\nnext_number = sequence[-1] + sequence[-2]\nnext_number\nassistant > The next number in the sequence is 56. Therefore, the value of \"?\" is <<<56>>>."
