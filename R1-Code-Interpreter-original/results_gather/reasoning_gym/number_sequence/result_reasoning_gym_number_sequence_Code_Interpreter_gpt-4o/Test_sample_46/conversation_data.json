    "\nassistant > The sequence provided is: 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, ?\n\nTo identify the pattern, let's examine the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n- The difference between the first term (3) and the second term (1) is -2.\n- The difference between the second term (1) and the third term (0) is -1.\n- The difference between the third term (0) and the fourth term (0) is 0.\n- The difference between the fourth term (0) and the fifth term (0) is 0.\n- The difference between the fifth term (0) and the sixth term (0) is 0.\n\nThe differences are: -2, -1, 0, 0, 0.\n\nIt appears that the differences are decreasing by 1 until they reach 0, and then they remain 0. Therefore, the next difference should also be 0, which means the next term in the sequence should be the same as the previous term.\n\nThus, the value of \"?\" is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
