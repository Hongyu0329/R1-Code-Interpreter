    "\nassistant > To find the pattern in the sequence \\(-9, -14, -21, -32, ?\\), let's first determine the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n- The difference between \\(-9\\) and \\(-14\\) is \\(-14 - (-9) = -5\\).\n- The difference between \\(-14\\) and \\(-21\\) is \\(-21 - (-14) = -7\\).\n- The difference between \\(-21\\) and \\(-32\\) is \\(-32 - (-21) = -11\\).\n\nThe differences are \\(-5, -7, -11\\). Let's examine the differences between these differences:\n\n- The difference between \\(-5\\) and \\(-7\\) is \\(-7 - (-5) = -2\\).\n- The difference between \\(-7\\) and \\(-11\\) is \\(-11 - (-7) = -4\\).\n\nThe differences between the differences are \\(-2, -4\\), which suggests a pattern of decreasing by 2 each time.\n\nFollowing this pattern, the next difference should be \\(-11 - 6 = -17\\).\n\nNow, let's calculate the next term in the sequence:\n\n- The next term after \\(-32\\) is \\(-32 - 17 = -49\\).\n\nThus, the value of \"?\" is \\(-49\\).\n\nThe value of \"?\" is enclosed within triple angle brackets: <<<-49>>>."
