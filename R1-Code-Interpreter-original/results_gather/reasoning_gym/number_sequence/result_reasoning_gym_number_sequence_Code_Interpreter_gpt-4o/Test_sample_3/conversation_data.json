    "\nassistant > To find the pattern in the sequence \\(-7, -1, -5, -1, -3, 0, 0, 3, ?\\), let's examine the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n1. \\(-1 - (-7) = 6\\)\n2. \\(-5 - (-1) = -4\\)\n3. \\(-1 - (-5) = 4\\)\n4. \\(-3 - (-1) = -2\\)\n5. \\(0 - (-3) = 3\\)\n6. \\(0 - 0 = 0\\)\n7. \\(3 - 0 = 3\\)\n\nThe differences are: \\(6, -4, 4, -2, 3, 0, 3\\).\n\nLet's see if there's a pattern in these differences. The differences seem to follow a pattern of alternating between positive and negative values, with the positive differences decreasing by 2 each time and the negative differences increasing by 2 each time:\n\n- \\(6\\) (positive)\n- \\(-4\\) (negative)\n- \\(4\\) (positive)\n- \\(-2\\) (negative)\n- \\(3\\) (positive)\n- \\(0\\) (negative)\n- \\(3\\) (positive)\n\nFollowing this pattern, the next difference should be \\(-2\\).\n\nLet's calculate the next term in the sequence using this difference:\n\n\\[3 + (-2) = 1\\]\n\nTherefore, the next term in the sequence is \\(1\\).\n\nThe value of \"?\" is enclosed within triple angle brackets: <<<1>>>."
