    "\nassistant > The sequence given is 3, 2, 4, 5, ?. Let's try to identify a pattern:\n\n- From 3 to 2, the difference is -1.\n- From 2 to 4, the difference is +2.\n- From 4 to 5, the difference is +1.\n\nThe differences are -1, +2, +1. It seems like the differences are alternating between -1 and +2, +1. \n\nIf we continue this pattern, the next difference should be -1. Therefore, the next number in the sequence should be 5 - 1 = 4.\n\nThus, the value of \"?\" is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
