    "\nassistant > The sequence given is an arithmetic sequence where each term decreases by 4 from the previous term. \n\nLet's break it down:\n- The first term is 2.\n- The second term is 2 - 4 = -2.\n- The third term is -2 - 4 = -6.\n- The fourth term is -6 - 4 = -10.\n- The fifth term is -10 - 4 = -14.\n\nTo find the next term, we subtract 4 from the fifth term:\n\n- The sixth term is -14 - 4 = -18.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is -18.\n\n<<<-18>>>"
