    "\nassistant > The sequence provided is \\(-5, -3, -2, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, ?\\).\n\nObserving the sequence, we can see that it starts with \\(-5\\) and increases by 2 to \\(-3\\), then by 1 to \\(-2\\), and finally by 1 to \\(-1\\). After reaching \\(-1\\), the sequence remains constant at \\(-1\\).\n\nGiven this pattern, it is reasonable to conclude that the sequence will continue with \\(-1\\).\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is \\(-1\\).\n\nSo, the output is:\n\n<<<-1>>>"
