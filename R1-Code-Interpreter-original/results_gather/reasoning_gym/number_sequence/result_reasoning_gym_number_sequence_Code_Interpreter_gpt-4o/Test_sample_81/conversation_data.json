    "\nassistant > To find the next number in the sequence, we need to identify the pattern or rule that governs the sequence.\n\nLet's examine the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n- \\(8 - 3 = 5\\)\n- \\(16 - 8 = 8\\)\n- \\(29 - 16 = 13\\)\n- \\(50 - 29 = 21\\)\n\nThe differences between consecutive terms are: 5, 8, 13, 21.\n\nThese differences themselves form a sequence: 5, 8, 13, 21. Let's examine the differences between these terms:\n\n- \\(8 - 5 = 3\\)\n- \\(13 - 8 = 5\\)\n- \\(21 - 13 = 8\\)\n\nThe differences between these terms are: 3, 5, 8, which are the first three terms of the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nThis suggests that the differences between the terms of the original sequence are increasing according to the Fibonacci sequence. The next difference should be \\(13\\) (the next Fibonacci number after 8).\n\nLet's calculate the next term in the original sequence:\n\n- Next difference: \\(21 + 13 = 34\\)\n- Next term: \\(50 + 34 = 84\\)\n\nTherefore, the next number in the sequence is 84.\n\nThe value of \"?\" is <<<84>>>."
