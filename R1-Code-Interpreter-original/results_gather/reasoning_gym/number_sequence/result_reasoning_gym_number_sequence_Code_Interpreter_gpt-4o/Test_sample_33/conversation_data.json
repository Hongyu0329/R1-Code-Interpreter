    "\nassistant > To find the pattern in the sequence \\(-8, -8, -16, -24, -40, ?\\), let's examine the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n1. \\(-8\\) to \\(-8\\): difference is \\(0\\)\n2. \\(-8\\) to \\(-16\\): difference is \\(-8\\)\n3. \\(-16\\) to \\(-24\\): difference is \\(-8\\)\n4. \\(-24\\) to \\(-40\\): difference is \\(-16\\)\n\nThe differences are \\(0, -8, -8, -16\\). It seems the differences are doubling every two steps. Let's calculate the next difference and the next term in the sequence.\n\nThe next difference should be \\(-16 \\times 2 = -32\\).\n\nNow, let's calculate the next term:\n\n\\(-40 + (-32) = -72\\)\n\nThus, the next term in the sequence is \\(-72\\).\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is \\(-72\\).\n\n<<<-72>>>"
