    "\nassistant > The sequence provided is: -10, -3, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, ?\n\nTo identify the pattern, let's examine the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n- The difference between -10 and -3 is 7.\n- The difference between -3 and -1 is 2.\n- The difference between -1 and -1 is 0.\n\nAfter the third term, the sequence remains constant at -1. This suggests that the sequence stabilizes at -1 after the initial changes.\n\nTherefore, the next term in the sequence is also -1.\n\nThe value of \"?\" is <<< -1 >>>."
