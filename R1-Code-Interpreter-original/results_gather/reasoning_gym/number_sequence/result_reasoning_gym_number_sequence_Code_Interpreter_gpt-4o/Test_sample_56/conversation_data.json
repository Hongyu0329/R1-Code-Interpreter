    "\nassistant > The sequence given is: 10, 10, 20, 30, 50, ?\n\nLet's analyze the pattern:\n\n- The first two numbers are both 10.\n- The third number is 20, which is the sum of the first two numbers (10 + 10).\n- The fourth number is 30, which is the sum of the second and third numbers (10 + 20).\n- The fifth number is 50, which is the sum of the third and fourth numbers (20 + 30).\n\nFollowing this pattern, the next number should be the sum of the fourth and fifth numbers (30 + 50).\n\nLet's calculate this: \n\n30 + 50 = 80\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is 80.\n\n<<<80>>>"
