    "\nassistant > The sequence given is an arithmetic sequence where each term increases by a constant difference. Let's find the common difference and the next term in the sequence.\n\nThe difference between consecutive terms is:\n\n19 - 5 = 14  \n33 - 19 = 14  \n47 - 33 = 14  \n61 - 47 = 14  \n75 - 61 = 14  \n89 - 75 = 14  \n\nThe common difference is 14. To find the next term, add 14 to the last term (89):\n\n89 + 14 = 103\n\nTherefore, the next term in the sequence is <<<103>>>."
