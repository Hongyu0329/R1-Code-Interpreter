    "\nassistant > The sequence given is 8, 4, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, ?. Let's analyze the pattern:\n\n- 8 to 4: Decrease by 4\n- 4 to 2: Decrease by 2\n- 2 to 1: Decrease by 1\n- 1 to 0: Decrease by 1\n- 0 to 0: Decrease by 0\n- 0 to 0: Decrease by 0\n\nThe pattern seems to be that the difference between consecutive terms is halved until it reaches 0, after which it remains 0. Therefore, the next term after the last 0 should also be 0.\n\nThus, the value of \"?\" is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
