    "\nassistant > The sequence given is \\(-9, -18, -36, -72, -144, -288, \\ldots\\).\n\nTo find the pattern, let's look at the ratio between consecutive terms:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-18}{-9} = 2, \\quad \\frac{-36}{-18} = 2, \\quad \\frac{-72}{-36} = 2, \\quad \\frac{-144}{-72} = 2, \\quad \\frac{-288}{-144} = 2\n\\]\n\nThe sequence is a geometric progression with a common ratio of 2. To find the next term, multiply the last term by 2:\n\n\\[\n-288 \\times 2 = -576\n\\]\n\nThus, the next term in the sequence is \\(-576\\).\n\nThe value of \"?\" is \\(-576\\).\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n<<<-576>>>"
