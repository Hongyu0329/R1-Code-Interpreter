    "\nassistant > To find the next number in the sequence, let's first identify the pattern. The sequence is:\n\n-2, -2, -4, -6, -10, -16, -26, -42, ?\n\nLet's look at the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n-2 to -2: difference = 0\n-2 to -4: difference = -2\n-4 to -6: difference = -2\n-6 to -10: difference = -4\n-10 to -16: difference = -6\n-16 to -26: difference = -10\n-26 to -42: difference = -16\n\nThe differences are: 0, -2, -2, -4, -6, -10, -16\n\nNow, let's look at the differences of these differences:\n\n0 to -2: difference = -2\n-2 to -2: difference = 0\n-2 to -4: difference = -2\n-4 to -6: difference = -2\n-6 to -10: difference = -4\n-10 to -16: difference = -6\n\nThe second-level differences are: -2, 0, -2, -2, -4, -6\n\nThe pattern in the second-level differences seems to be decreasing by 2 each time, starting from -2. Let's calculate the next second-level difference:\n\n-6 - 2 = -8\n\nNow, let's calculate the next first-level difference:\n\n-16 - 8 = -24\n\nFinally, let's calculate the next term in the sequence:\n\n-42 - 24 = -66\n\nTherefore, the next number in the sequence is -66.\n\nThe value of \"?\" is <<<-66>>>."
