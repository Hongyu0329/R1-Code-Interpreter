    "\nassistant > To find the next number in the sequence, let's first look at the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n- \\(5\\) to \\(5\\): difference is \\(0\\)\n- \\(5\\) to \\(10\\): difference is \\(5\\)\n- \\(10\\) to \\(15\\): difference is \\(5\\)\n- \\(15\\) to \\(25\\): difference is \\(10\\)\n- \\(25\\) to \\(40\\): difference is \\(15\\)\n- \\(40\\) to \\(65\\): difference is \\(25\\)\n\nThe differences themselves form a sequence: \\(0, 5, 5, 10, 15, 25\\).\n\nLet's look at the differences between these differences:\n\n- \\(5 - 0 = 5\\)\n- \\(5 - 5 = 0\\)\n- \\(10 - 5 = 5\\)\n- \\(15 - 10 = 5\\)\n- \\(25 - 15 = 10\\)\n\nThe second-level differences are: \\(5, 0, 5, 5, 10\\).\n\nIt seems like the differences are increasing in a pattern. Let's try to predict the next difference and use it to find the next term in the original sequence.\n\nThe next difference in the second-level differences could be \\(15\\) (following the pattern of increasing by 5 after every two terms).\n\nLet's calculate the next term in the sequence using this information.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Given sequence\nsequence = [5, 5, 10, 15, 25, 40, 65]\n\n# Calculate the differences between consecutive terms\ndifferences = [sequence[i] - sequence[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(sequence))]\n\n# Calculate the second-level differences\nsecond_level_differences = [differences[i] - differences[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(differences))]\n\n# Predict the next second-level difference\nnext_second_level_difference = 15\n\n# Calculate the next first-level difference\nnext_difference = differences[-1] + next_second_level_difference\n\n# Calculate the next term in the sequence\nnext_term = sequence[-1] + next_difference\nnext_term\nassistant > The next number in the sequence is <<<105>>>."
