    "\nassistant > The sequence appears to be decreasing, and it seems to be following a pattern. Let's analyze the sequence:\n\n- 9\n- 2\n- 2\n- 1\n- 0\n- 0\n- 0\n\nThe sequence starts with 9, then drops to 2, stays at 2, drops to 1, and then stays at 0. It seems like the sequence is decreasing and then stabilizing at 0.\n\nBased on this pattern, the next number in the sequence is likely to be 0.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is <<<0>>>."
