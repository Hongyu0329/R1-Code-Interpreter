    "\nassistant > To find the pattern in the sequence \\(-6, -30, -78, -174, ?\\), let's first look at the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n1. \\(-30 - (-6) = -24\\)\n2. \\(-78 - (-30) = -48\\)\n3. \\(-174 - (-78) = -96\\)\n\nThe differences are \\(-24, -48, -96\\). We can see that each difference is double the previous one:\n\n- \\(-48 = 2 \\times -24\\)\n- \\(-96 = 2 \\times -48\\)\n\nFollowing this pattern, the next difference should be \\(2 \\times -96 = -192\\).\n\nNow, let's calculate the next term in the sequence:\n\n\\(-174 + (-192) = -366\\)\n\nThus, the next term in the sequence is \\(-366\\).\n\nThe value of \"?\" is \\(-366\\).\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n<<<-366>>>"
