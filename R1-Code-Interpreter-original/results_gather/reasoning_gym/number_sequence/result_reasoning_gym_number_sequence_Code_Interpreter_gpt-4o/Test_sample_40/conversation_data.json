    "\nassistant > To find the next number in the sequence, let's first examine the pattern in the given numbers:\n\n9, 9, 18, 27, 45, 72, 117, 189\n\nWe can observe the following differences between consecutive terms:\n\n- 9 to 9: difference of 0\n- 9 to 18: difference of 9\n- 18 to 27: difference of 9\n- 27 to 45: difference of 18\n- 45 to 72: difference of 27\n- 72 to 117: difference of 45\n- 117 to 189: difference of 72\n\nThe differences themselves form a sequence: 0, 9, 9, 18, 27, 45, 72\n\nThis sequence of differences seems to follow a pattern similar to the Fibonacci sequence, where each term is the sum of the two preceding terms, starting from 9 and 9:\n\n- 9 + 9 = 18\n- 9 + 18 = 27\n- 18 + 27 = 45\n- 27 + 45 = 72\n- 45 + 72 = 117\n\nFollowing this pattern, the next difference should be:\n\n72 + 117 = 189\n\nNow, let's add this difference to the last number in the original sequence to find the next number:\n\n189 + 189 = 378\n\nTherefore, the next number in the sequence is 378.\n\nThe value of \"?\" is <<<378>>>."
