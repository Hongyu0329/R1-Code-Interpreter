    "\nassistant > The sequence provided is: 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, ?\n\nTo identify the pattern, let's examine the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n- The difference between the first term (3) and the second term (1) is -2.\n- The difference between the second term (1) and the third term (0) is -1.\n- The difference between the third term (0) and the fourth term (0) is 0.\n- The difference between the fourth term (0) and the fifth term (0) is 0.\n\nIt appears that the sequence is decreasing by 2, then by 1, and then remains constant at 0. \n\nFollowing this pattern, the next term should also be 0.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
