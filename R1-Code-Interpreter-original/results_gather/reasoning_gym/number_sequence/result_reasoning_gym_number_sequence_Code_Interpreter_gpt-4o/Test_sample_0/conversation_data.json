    "\nassistant > To find the next number in the sequence, let's first look at the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n- \\(13 - 6 = 7\\)\n- \\(26 - 13 = 13\\)\n- \\(46 - 26 = 20\\)\n- \\(79 - 46 = 33\\)\n\nThe differences are: 7, 13, 20, 33.\n\nNow, let's look at the differences between these differences:\n\n- \\(13 - 7 = 6\\)\n- \\(20 - 13 = 7\\)\n- \\(33 - 20 = 13\\)\n\nThe second-level differences are: 6, 7, 13.\n\nIt seems like the second-level differences are increasing in a pattern similar to the original sequence. Let's assume the next second-level difference follows this pattern:\n\n- Next second-level difference: \\(13 + 6 = 19\\)\n\nNow, let's calculate the next first-level difference:\n\n- Next first-level difference: \\(33 + 19 = 52\\)\n\nFinally, let's find the next term in the sequence:\n\n- Next term: \\(79 + 52 = 131\\)\n\nTherefore, the next number in the sequence is 131.\n\nThe value of \"?\" is enclosed within triple angle brackets: <<<131>>>."
