    "\nassistant > The sequence given is: 6, -12, 24, -48, 96, -192, 384, ...\n\nTo find the pattern, let's look at the ratio between consecutive terms:\n\n- \\(-12 / 6 = -2\\)\n- \\(24 / -12 = -2\\)\n- \\(-48 / 24 = -2\\)\n- \\(96 / -48 = -2\\)\n- \\(-192 / 96 = -2\\)\n- \\(384 / -192 = -2\\)\n\nThe pattern is that each term is multiplied by \\(-2\\) to get the next term.\n\nTo find the next term after 384, we multiply 384 by \\(-2\\):\n\n\\[ 384 \\times -2 = -768 \\]\n\nThus, the next term in the sequence is \\(-768\\).\n\nThe value of \"?\" is <<<-768>>>."
