    "\nassistant > To find the next number in the sequence, let's first look at the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n- The difference between 15 and 7 is \\(15 - 7 = 8\\).\n- The difference between 30 and 15 is \\(30 - 15 = 15\\).\n- The difference between 53 and 30 is \\(53 - 30 = 23\\).\n\nLet's examine the differences: 8, 15, 23.\n\nThe differences themselves seem to be increasing. Let's look at the differences between these differences:\n\n- The difference between 15 and 8 is \\(15 - 8 = 7\\).\n- The difference between 23 and 15 is \\(23 - 15 = 8\\).\n\nThe second-level differences are 7 and 8, which increase by 1. If this pattern continues, the next second-level difference should be 9.\n\nLet's calculate the next first-level difference:\n\n- The next first-level difference should be \\(23 + 9 = 32\\).\n\nNow, let's find the next term in the sequence:\n\n- The next term should be \\(53 + 32 = 85\\).\n\nTherefore, the next number in the sequence is 85.\n\nThe value of \"?\" is <<<85>>>."
