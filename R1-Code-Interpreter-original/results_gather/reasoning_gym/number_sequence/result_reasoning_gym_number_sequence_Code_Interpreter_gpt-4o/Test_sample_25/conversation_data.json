    "\nassistant > To find the next number in the sequence, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence. Let's examine the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n- The difference between -1 and -4 is -3.\n- The difference between -4 and -8 is -4.\n- The difference between -8 and -15 is -7.\n- The difference between -15 and -26 is -11.\n- The difference between -26 and -44 is -18.\n- The difference between -44 and -73 is -29.\n\nLet's list these differences: -3, -4, -7, -11, -18, -29.\n\nNow, let's examine the differences between these differences:\n\n- The difference between -3 and -4 is -1.\n- The difference between -4 and -7 is -3.\n- The difference between -7 and -11 is -4.\n- The difference between -11 and -18 is -7.\n- The difference between -18 and -29 is -11.\n\nThese second-level differences are: -1, -3, -4, -7, -11.\n\nLet's examine the differences between these second-level differences:\n\n- The difference between -1 and -3 is -2.\n- The difference between -3 and -4 is -1.\n- The difference between -4 and -7 is -3.\n- The difference between -7 and -11 is -4.\n\nThese third-level differences are: -2, -1, -3, -4.\n\nThe third-level differences do not form a simple arithmetic sequence, so let's try to find a pattern in the second-level differences. The second-level differences are: -1, -3, -4, -7, -11.\n\nThe differences between these second-level differences are: -2, -1, -3, -4.\n\nThe pattern in the second-level differences seems to be related to the Fibonacci sequence, where each term is the sum of the two preceding terms, but with negative signs. Let's verify this:\n\n- -1 + (-3) = -4\n- -3 + (-4) = -7\n- -4 + (-7) = -11\n\nThe next second-level difference should be -7 + (-11) = -18.\n\nLet's calculate the next first-level difference using this pattern:\n\n- The last first-level difference is -29.\n- The next second-level difference is -18.\n\nThe next first-level difference should be -29 + (-18) = -47.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the next term in the sequence:\n\n- The last term in the sequence is -73.\n- The next first-level difference is -47.\n\nThe next term should be -73 + (-47) = -120.\n\nTherefore, the next number in the sequence is -120.\n\nThe value of \"?\" is <<<-120>>>."
