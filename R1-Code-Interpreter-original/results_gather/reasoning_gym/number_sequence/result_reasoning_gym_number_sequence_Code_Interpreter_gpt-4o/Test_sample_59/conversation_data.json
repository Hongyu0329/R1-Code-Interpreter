    "\nassistant > To find the next number in the sequence, let's first look at the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n- The difference between -4 and -4 is 0.\n- The difference between -4 and -8 is -4.\n- The difference between -8 and -12 is -4.\n- The difference between -12 and -20 is -8.\n- The difference between -20 and -32 is -12.\n- The difference between -32 and -52 is -20.\n\nNow, let's look at the differences between these differences:\n\n- The difference between 0 and -4 is -4.\n- The difference between -4 and -4 is 0.\n- The difference between -4 and -8 is -4.\n- The difference between -8 and -12 is -4.\n- The difference between -12 and -20 is -8.\n\nThe second-level differences are: -4, 0, -4, -4, -8.\n\nIt seems that the second-level differences are not consistent, so let's try to find a pattern in the first-level differences:\n\n0, -4, -4, -8, -12, -20\n\nThe differences between these differences are:\n\n- The difference between 0 and -4 is -4.\n- The difference between -4 and -4 is 0.\n- The difference between -4 and -8 is -4.\n- The difference between -8 and -12 is -4.\n- The difference between -12 and -20 is -8.\n\nThe second-level differences are: -4, 0, -4, -4, -8.\n\nIt seems that the second-level differences are decreasing by 4 every two steps. Let's assume this pattern continues. The next second-level difference would be -12.\n\nNow, let's calculate the next first-level difference:\n\n- The last first-level difference is -20.\n- The next second-level difference is -12.\n\nSo, the next first-level difference is -20 + (-12) = -32.\n\nFinally, let's calculate the next term in the sequence:\n\n- The last term in the sequence is -52.\n- The next first-level difference is -32.\n\nSo, the next term is -52 + (-32) = -84.\n\nTherefore, the next number in the sequence is <<<-84>>>."
