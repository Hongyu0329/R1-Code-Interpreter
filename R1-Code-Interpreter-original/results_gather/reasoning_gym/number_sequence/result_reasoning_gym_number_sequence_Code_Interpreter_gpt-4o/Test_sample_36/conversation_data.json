    "\nassistant > The sequence provided is \\(-5, -3, -2, -1, -1, -1, -1, ?\\).\n\nObserving the sequence, we can see that it starts with -5 and increases by 2, then by 1, and then remains constant at -1. This suggests that the sequence is approaching a stable value of -1.\n\nTherefore, the next value in the sequence is likely to be -1.\n\nThus, the value of \"?\" is:\n\n<<<-1>>>"
