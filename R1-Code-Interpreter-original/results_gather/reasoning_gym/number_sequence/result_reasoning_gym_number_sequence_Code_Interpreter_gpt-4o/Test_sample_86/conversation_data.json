    "\nassistant > The sequence given is \\(-10, -5, -3, -2, -1, -1, ?\\).\n\nLet's examine the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n- \\(-5 - (-10) = 5\\)\n- \\(-3 - (-5) = 2\\)\n- \\(-2 - (-3) = 1\\)\n- \\(-1 - (-2) = 1\\)\n- \\(-1 - (-1) = 0\\)\n\nThe differences are \\(5, 2, 1, 1, 0\\).\n\nIt seems the differences are decreasing by 3, 1, 0, 0, -1. The next difference should be \\(-1\\).\n\nTherefore, the next term in the sequence should be \\(-1 - (-1) = -1 - 1 = -2\\).\n\nThus, the value of \"?\" is \\(-2\\).\n\nSo, the value of \"?\" is enclosed within triple angle brackets: <<<-2>>>."
