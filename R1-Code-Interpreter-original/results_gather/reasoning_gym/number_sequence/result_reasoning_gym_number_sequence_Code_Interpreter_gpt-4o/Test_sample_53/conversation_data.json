    "\nassistant > The sequence given is \\(-3, -3, -6, -9, -15, ?\\).\n\nLet's examine the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n- \\(-3\\) to \\(-3\\): difference is \\(0\\)\n- \\(-3\\) to \\(-6\\): difference is \\(-3\\)\n- \\(-6\\) to \\(-9\\): difference is \\(-3\\)\n- \\(-9\\) to \\(-15\\): difference is \\(-6\\)\n\nThe differences are \\(0, -3, -3, -6\\).\n\nIt seems like the differences are following a pattern. Let's check if the differences themselves have a pattern:\n\n- \\(0\\) to \\(-3\\): difference is \\(-3\\)\n- \\(-3\\) to \\(-3\\): difference is \\(0\\)\n- \\(-3\\) to \\(-6\\): difference is \\(-3\\)\n\nThe differences of the differences are \\(-3, 0, -3\\).\n\nIt seems like the differences of the differences are alternating between \\(-3\\) and \\(0\\). If this pattern continues, the next difference of the differences should be \\(0\\), which means the next difference should be the same as the previous one, \\(-6\\).\n\nTherefore, the next term in the sequence should be \\(-15 - 6 = -21\\).\n\nSo, the value of \"?\" is \\(-21\\).\n\nThus, the output is:\n\n<<<-21>>>"
