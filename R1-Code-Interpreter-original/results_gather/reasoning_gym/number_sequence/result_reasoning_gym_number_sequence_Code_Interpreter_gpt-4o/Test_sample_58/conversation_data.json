    "\nassistant > The sequence given is a variation of the Fibonacci sequence, where each term is the sum of the two preceding ones, but with negative values. Let's analyze the sequence:\n\n- The first term is \\(-1\\).\n- The second term is \\(-1\\).\n- The third term is \\(-2\\) (which is \\(-1 + -1\\)).\n- The fourth term is \\(-3\\) (which is \\(-1 + -2\\)).\n- The fifth term is \\(-5\\) (which is \\(-2 + -3\\)).\n- The sixth term is \\(-8\\) (which is \\(-3 + -5\\)).\n- The seventh term is \\(-13\\) (which is \\(-5 + -8\\)).\n- The eighth term is \\(-21\\) (which is \\(-8 + -13\\)).\n\nTo find the next term, we add the last two terms of the sequence:\n\n\\[\n-13 + (-21) = -34\n\\]\n\nThus, the next term in the sequence is \\(-34\\).\n\nThe value of \"?\" is therefore <<<-34>>>."
