    "\nassistant > The sequence provided is: 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, ?\n\nTo determine the pattern, let's examine the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n- The difference between the 1st term (2) and the 2nd term (1) is -1.\n- The difference between the 2nd term (1) and the 3rd term (0) is -1.\n- The difference between the 3rd term (0) and the 4th term (0) is 0.\n- The difference between the 4th term (0) and the 5th term (0) is 0.\n- The difference between the 5th term (0) and the 6th term (0) is 0.\n\nIt appears that after reaching 0, the sequence remains constant at 0. Therefore, the next term in the sequence is also 0.\n\nThus, the value of \"?\" is <<<0>>>."
