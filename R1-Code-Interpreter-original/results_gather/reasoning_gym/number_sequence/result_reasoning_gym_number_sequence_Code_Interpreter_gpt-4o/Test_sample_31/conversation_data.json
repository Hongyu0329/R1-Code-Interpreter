    "\nassistant > The sequence given is: -8, -2, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, ?\n\nLet's analyze the pattern:\n\n1. The first number is -8.\n2. The second number is -2, which is 6 more than -8.\n3. The third number is -1, which is 1 more than -2.\n4. The subsequent numbers are all -1.\n\nIt seems that after reaching -1, the sequence remains constant at -1. Therefore, the next number in the sequence is also -1.\n\nThus, the value of \"?\" is <<< -1 >>>."
