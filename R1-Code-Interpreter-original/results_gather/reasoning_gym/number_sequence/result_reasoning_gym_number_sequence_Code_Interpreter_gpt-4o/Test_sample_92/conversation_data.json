    "\nassistant > The sequence given is \\(-9, -6, -4, -3, -3, -3, ?\\).\n\nLet's examine the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n- \\(-6 - (-9) = 3\\)\n- \\(-4 - (-6) = 2\\)\n- \\(-3 - (-4) = 1\\)\n- \\(-3 - (-3) = 0\\)\n- \\(-3 - (-3) = 0\\)\n\nThe differences are \\(3, 2, 1, 0, 0\\). It appears that the differences are decreasing by 1 until they reach 0, and then they remain constant at 0.\n\nFollowing this pattern, the next difference should also be 0. Therefore, the next term in the sequence should be the same as the previous term, which is \\(-3\\).\n\nThus, the value of \"?\" is \\(-3\\).\n\nThe value of \"?\" is enclosed within triple angle brackets: <<<-3>>>."
