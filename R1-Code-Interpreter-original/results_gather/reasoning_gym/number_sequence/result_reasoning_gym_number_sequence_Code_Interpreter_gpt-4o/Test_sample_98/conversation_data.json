    "\nassistant > The sequence given is 8, 5, 3, 2, 2, ?. Let's try to identify a pattern:\n\n- The difference between the first and second terms is \\(8 - 5 = 3\\).\n- The difference between the second and third terms is \\(5 - 3 = 2\\).\n- The difference between the third and fourth terms is \\(3 - 2 = 1\\).\n- The difference between the fourth and fifth terms is \\(2 - 2 = 0\\).\n\nThe differences are decreasing by 1 each time: 3, 2, 1, 0. If this pattern continues, the next difference should be \\(-1\\).\n\nTherefore, the next term should be \\(2 - 1 = 1\\).\n\nThus, the value of \"?\" is <<<1>>>."
