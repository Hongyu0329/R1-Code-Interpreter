    "\nassistant > The sequence given is 4, 2, 1, 0, 0, ?. Let's analyze the pattern:\n\n- 4 to 2: Decrease by 2\n- 2 to 1: Decrease by 1\n- 1 to 0: Decrease by 1\n- 0 to 0: Decrease by 0\n\nThe pattern seems to be decreasing by 2, then 1, then 1, then 0. Following this pattern, the next decrease should be 0 again.\n\nTherefore, the next number in the sequence should be 0.\n\nThe value of \"?\" is <<<0>>>."
