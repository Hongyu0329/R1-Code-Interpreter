    "\nassistant > The sequence given is: 7, 7, 14, 21, 35, 56, ?\n\nLet's analyze the pattern:\n\n1. The first two numbers are both 7.\n2. The third number is 14, which is the sum of the first two numbers (7 + 7).\n3. The fourth number is 21, which is the sum of the second and third numbers (7 + 14).\n4. The fifth number is 35, which is the sum of the third and fourth numbers (14 + 21).\n5. The sixth number is 56, which is the sum of the fourth and fifth numbers (21 + 35).\n\nThis sequence follows the pattern of the Fibonacci sequence, but it starts with two 7s instead of 0 and 1.\n\nTo find the next number in the sequence, we add the fifth and sixth numbers:\n\n35 + 56 = 91\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is 91.\n\nThe output is: <<<91>>>"
