    "\nassistant > To find the pattern in the sequence, let's examine the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n1. \\(-3 - (-9) = 6\\)\n2. \\(-10 - (-3) = -7\\)\n3. \\(-6 - (-10) = 4\\)\n4. \\(-12 - (-6) = -6\\)\n5. \\(-9 - (-12) = 3\\)\n6. \\(-15 - (-9) = -6\\)\n\nThe differences are: \\(6, -7, 4, -6, 3, -6\\).\n\nIt seems that the differences alternate between a positive number and \\(-6\\). Let's verify this pattern:\n\n- The first difference is \\(6\\).\n- The second difference is \\(-7\\).\n- The third difference is \\(4\\).\n- The fourth difference is \\(-6\\).\n- The fifth difference is \\(3\\).\n- The sixth difference is \\(-6\\).\n\nThe pattern seems to be: \\(6, -7, 4, -6, 3, -6\\).\n\nFollowing this pattern, the next difference should be \\(2\\) (since the differences are decreasing by 1 each time: \\(6, 4, 3, 2\\)).\n\nLet's calculate the next term in the sequence:\n\n\\(-15 + 2 = -13\\).\n\nTherefore, the next term in the sequence is \\(-13\\).\n\nThus, the value of \"?\" is:\n\n<<<-13>>>"
