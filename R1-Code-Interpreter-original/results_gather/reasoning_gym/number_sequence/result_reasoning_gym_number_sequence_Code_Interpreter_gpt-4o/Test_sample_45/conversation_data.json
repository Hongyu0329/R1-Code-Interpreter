    "\nassistant > The sequence given is 7, 14, 28, 56, 112, and it appears to be a geometric sequence where each term is multiplied by 2 to get the next term.\n\nLet's verify this pattern:\n- \\(7 \\times 2 = 14\\)\n- \\(14 \\times 2 = 28\\)\n- \\(28 \\times 2 = 56\\)\n- \\(56 \\times 2 = 112\\)\n\nFollowing this pattern, the next term should be:\n- \\(112 \\times 2 = 224\\)\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is <<<224>>>."
