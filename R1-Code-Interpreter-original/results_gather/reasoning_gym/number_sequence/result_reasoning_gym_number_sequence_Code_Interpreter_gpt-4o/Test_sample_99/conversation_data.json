    "\nassistant > To find the next number in the sequence, let's first look at the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n- \\(9, 9, 18, 27, 45, 72, 117, 189\\)\n\nThe differences are:\n\n- \\(9 - 9 = 0\\)\n- \\(18 - 9 = 9\\)\n- \\(27 - 18 = 9\\)\n- \\(45 - 27 = 18\\)\n- \\(72 - 45 = 27\\)\n- \\(117 - 72 = 45\\)\n- \\(189 - 117 = 72\\)\n\nThe differences themselves form a sequence: \\(0, 9, 9, 18, 27, 45, 72\\).\n\nNow, let's look at the differences of these differences:\n\n- \\(9 - 0 = 9\\)\n- \\(9 - 9 = 0\\)\n- \\(18 - 9 = 9\\)\n- \\(27 - 18 = 9\\)\n- \\(45 - 27 = 18\\)\n- \\(72 - 45 = 27\\)\n\nThe second-level differences are: \\(9, 0, 9, 9, 18, 27\\).\n\nIt seems that the second-level differences are following a pattern similar to the Fibonacci sequence: \\(9, 9, 18, 27, 45, 72, \\ldots\\).\n\nLet's calculate the next term in the sequence using this pattern.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Given sequence\nsequence = [9, 9, 18, 27, 45, 72, 117, 189]\n\n# Calculate the differences\ndifferences = [sequence[i] - sequence[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(sequence))]\n\n# Calculate the next difference using the pattern\nnext_difference = differences[-1] + differences[-2]\n\n# Calculate the next term in the sequence\nnext_term = sequence[-1] + next_difference\nnext_term\nassistant > The next number in the sequence is <<<306>>>."
