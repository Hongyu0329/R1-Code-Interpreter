    "\nassistant > The sequence given is 7, 14, 28, 56, 112, ?. \n\nTo find the pattern, let's look at the relationship between consecutive terms:\n\n- \\(14 = 7 \\times 2\\)\n- \\(28 = 14 \\times 2\\)\n- \\(56 = 28 \\times 2\\)\n- \\(112 = 56 \\times 2\\)\n\nIt appears that each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by 2. \n\nTherefore, the next term should be \\(112 \\times 2\\).\n\nLet's calculate that.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Calculate the next term in the sequence\nprevious_term = 112\nnext_term = previous_term * 2\nnext_term\nassistant > The next term in the sequence is 224.
