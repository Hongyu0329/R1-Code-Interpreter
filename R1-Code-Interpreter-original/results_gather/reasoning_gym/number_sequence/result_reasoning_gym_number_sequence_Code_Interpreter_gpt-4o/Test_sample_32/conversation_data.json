    "\nassistant > The sequence given is 10, 5, 2, 1, 0. Let's analyze the pattern:\n\n- From 10 to 5, the difference is -5.\n- From 5 to 2, the difference is -3.\n- From 2 to 1, the difference is -1.\n- From 1 to 0, the difference is -1.\n\nThe differences are -5, -3, -1, -1. It seems like the differences are decreasing by 2, then by 2, and then staying the same. \n\nIf we continue this pattern, the next difference should be -1. Therefore, the next number in the sequence should be 0 - 1 = -1.\n\nThus, the value of \"?\" is -1.\n\n<<<-1>>>"
