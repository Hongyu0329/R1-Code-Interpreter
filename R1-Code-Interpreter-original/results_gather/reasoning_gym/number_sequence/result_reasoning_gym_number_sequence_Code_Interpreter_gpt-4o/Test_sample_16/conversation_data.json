    "\nassistant > The sequence given is \\(-8, -16, -32, -64, \\ldots\\).\n\nTo find the pattern, let's look at the ratio between consecutive terms:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-16}{-8} = 2, \\quad \\frac{-32}{-16} = 2, \\quad \\frac{-64}{-32} = 2\n\\]\n\nThe sequence is a geometric progression with a common ratio of 2. To find the next term, multiply the last term by the common ratio:\n\n\\[\n-64 \\times 2 = -128\n\\]\n\nThus, the next term in the sequence is \\(-128\\).\n\nThe value of \"?\" is <<<-128>>>."
