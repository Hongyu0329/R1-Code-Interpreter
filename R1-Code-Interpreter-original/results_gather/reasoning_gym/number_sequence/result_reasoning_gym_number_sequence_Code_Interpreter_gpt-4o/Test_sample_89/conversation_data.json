    "\nassistant > The sequence given is: -5, -5, -10, -15, -25, -40, ?\n\nLet's examine the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n- The difference between the first and second terms: \\(-5 - (-5) = 0\\)\n- The difference between the second and third terms: \\(-10 - (-5) = -5\\)\n- The difference between the third and fourth terms: \\(-15 - (-10) = -5\\)\n- The difference between the fourth and fifth terms: \\(-25 - (-15) = -10\\)\n- The difference between the fifth and sixth terms: \\(-40 - (-25) = -15\\)\n\nThe differences are: 0, -5, -5, -10, -15\n\nIt appears that the differences themselves are decreasing by 5 each time after the initial 0. If this pattern continues, the next difference should be \\(-15 - 5 = -20\\).\n\nTherefore, the next term in the sequence should be:\n\\(-40 - 20 = -60\\)\n\nThus, the value of \"?\" is \\(-60\\).\n\nThe value of \"?\" is enclosed within triple angle brackets: <<<-60>>>."
