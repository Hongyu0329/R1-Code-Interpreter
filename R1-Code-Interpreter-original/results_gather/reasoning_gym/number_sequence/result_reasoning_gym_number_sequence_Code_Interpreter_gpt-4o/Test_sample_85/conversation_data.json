    "\nassistant > The sequence given is \\(-6, -6, -12, -18, ?\\).\n\nTo find the pattern, let's look at the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n- The difference between the first and second terms is \\(-6 - (-6) = 0\\).\n- The difference between the second and third terms is \\(-12 - (-6) = -6\\).\n- The difference between the third and fourth terms is \\(-18 - (-12) = -6\\).\n\nThe differences are \\(0, -6, -6\\). It seems that after the initial repetition, the sequence decreases by 6 each time.\n\nFollowing this pattern, the next difference should also be \\(-6\\).\n\nSo, the next term should be \\(-18 - 6 = -24\\).\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is \\(-24\\).\n\nThe value of \"?\" is enclosed within triple angle brackets: <<<-24>>>."
