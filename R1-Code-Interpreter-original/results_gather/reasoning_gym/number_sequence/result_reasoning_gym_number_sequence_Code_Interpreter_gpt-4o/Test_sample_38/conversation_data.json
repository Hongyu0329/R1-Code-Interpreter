    "\nassistant > To find the next number in the sequence, let's first identify the pattern:\n\nThe sequence is: 2, 2, 4, 6, 10, 16, ?\n\nLet's look at the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n- 2 to 2: difference is 0\n- 2 to 4: difference is 2\n- 4 to 6: difference is 2\n- 6 to 10: difference is 4\n- 10 to 16: difference is 6\n\nThe differences are: 0, 2, 2, 4, 6\n\nNow, let's look at the differences between these differences:\n\n- 0 to 2: difference is 2\n- 2 to 2: difference is 0\n- 2 to 4: difference is 2\n- 4 to 6: difference is 2\n\nThe second-level differences are: 2, 0, 2, 2\n\nIt seems that the second-level differences are following a pattern of increasing by 2 every two steps. Let's predict the next difference:\n\n- 6 to ?: difference should be 8 (since the pattern is increasing by 2)\n\nNow, let's calculate the next number in the sequence:\n\n16 + 8 = 24\n\nTherefore, the next number in the sequence is 24.\n\nThe value of \"?\" is <<<24>>>."
