    "\nassistant > To find the next number in the sequence, let's first look at the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n- \\(8\\) to \\(8\\): difference is \\(0\\)\n- \\(8\\) to \\(16\\): difference is \\(8\\)\n- \\(16\\) to \\(24\\): difference is \\(8\\)\n- \\(24\\) to \\(40\\): difference is \\(16\\)\n- \\(40\\) to \\(64\\): difference is \\(24\\)\n- \\(64\\) to \\(104\\): difference is \\(40\\)\n\nThe differences themselves form a sequence: \\(0, 8, 8, 16, 24, 40\\).\n\nLet's look at the differences between these differences:\n\n- \\(8 - 0 = 8\\)\n- \\(8 - 8 = 0\\)\n- \\(16 - 8 = 8\\)\n- \\(24 - 16 = 8\\)\n- \\(40 - 24 = 16\\)\n\nThe second-level differences are: \\(8, 0, 8, 8, 16\\).\n\nIt seems like the second-level differences are increasing by a pattern of \\(8, 0, 8, 8, 16\\). Let's assume the next difference in this pattern is \\(24\\) (since \\(16 + 8 = 24\\)).\n\nNow, let's calculate the next first-level difference:\n\n- Next first-level difference: \\(40 + 24 = 64\\)\n\nFinally, let's calculate the next term in the original sequence:\n\n- Next term: \\(104 + 64 = 168\\)\n\nTherefore, the next number in the sequence is <<<168>>>."
