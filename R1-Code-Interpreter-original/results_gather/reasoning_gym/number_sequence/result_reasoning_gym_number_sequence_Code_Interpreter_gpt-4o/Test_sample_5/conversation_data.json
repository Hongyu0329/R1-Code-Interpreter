    "\nassistant > The sequence provided is: -7, 0, 4, 6, 7, 7, 7, ?\n\nTo determine the pattern, let's examine the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n- 0 - (-7) = 7\n- 4 - 0 = 4\n- 6 - 4 = 2\n- 7 - 6 = 1\n- 7 - 7 = 0\n- 7 - 7 = 0\n\nThe differences are: 7, 4, 2, 1, 0, 0\n\nThe differences themselves are decreasing by 3, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, which suggests that the differences are decreasing by 1 until they reach 0, and then they remain constant.\n\nFollowing this pattern, the next difference should also be 0, meaning the next term in the sequence should be the same as the previous term.\n\nTherefore, the next term is 7.\n\nThe value of \"?\" is <<<7>>>."
