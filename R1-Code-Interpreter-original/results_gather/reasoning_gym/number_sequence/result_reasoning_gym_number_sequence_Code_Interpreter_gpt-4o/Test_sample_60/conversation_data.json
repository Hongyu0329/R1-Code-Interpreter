    "\nassistant > To find the pattern in the sequence 8, 9, 18, 28, 47, let's look at the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n- Difference between 9 and 8 is 1.\n- Difference between 18 and 9 is 9.\n- Difference between 28 and 18 is 10.\n- Difference between 47 and 28 is 19.\n\nThe differences are: 1, 9, 10, 19.\n\nLet's look at the differences between these differences:\n\n- Difference between 9 and 1 is 8.\n- Difference between 10 and 9 is 1.\n- Difference between 19 and 10 is 9.\n\nThe second-level differences are: 8, 1, 9.\n\nIt seems like the second-level differences are repeating the pattern 8, 1, 9. If this pattern continues, the next second-level difference should be 1.\n\nLet's calculate the next first-level difference:\n\n- The last first-level difference is 19.\n- Adding the next second-level difference (1) to 19 gives us 20.\n\nNow, let's find the next term in the sequence:\n\n- The last term in the sequence is 47.\n- Adding the next first-level difference (20) to 47 gives us 67.\n\nTherefore, the next term in the sequence is 67.\n\nThe value of \"?\" is <<<67>>>."
