    "\nassistant > To find the next number in the sequence \\(-2, -2, -4, -6, ?\\), let's first identify the pattern:\n\n1. The difference between the first and second numbers is \\( -2 - (-2) = 0 \\).\n2. The difference between the second and third numbers is \\( -4 - (-2) = -2 \\).\n3. The difference between the third and fourth numbers is \\( -6 - (-4) = -2 \\).\n\nThe differences between consecutive terms are \\(0, -2, -2\\). It seems that after the initial zero difference, the sequence decreases by 2 each time.\n\nFollowing this pattern, the difference between the fourth number and the fifth number should also be \\(-2\\).\n\nLet's calculate the next number in the sequence:\n\n\\[\n-6 + (-2) = -8\n\\]\n\nThus, the next number in the sequence is \\(-8\\).\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is enclosed within triple angle brackets as follows: <<<-8>>>."
