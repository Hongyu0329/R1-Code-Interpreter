    "\nassistant > To find the pattern in the sequence 4, -1, -2, -8, -15, ?, let's look at the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n- The difference between the first and second terms: \\(-1 - 4 = -5\\)\n- The difference between the second and third terms: \\(-2 - (-1) = -1\\)\n- The difference between the third and fourth terms: \\(-8 - (-2) = -6\\)\n- The difference between the fourth and fifth terms: \\(-15 - (-8) = -7\\)\n\nThe differences are: -5, -1, -6, -7.\n\nLet's see if there's a pattern in these differences. The differences themselves don't form a simple arithmetic or geometric sequence, but let's try to find a pattern by examining the differences between these differences:\n\n- The difference between the first and second differences: \\(-1 - (-5) = 4\\)\n- The difference between the second and third differences: \\(-6 - (-1) = -5\\)\n- The difference between the third and fourth differences: \\(-7 - (-6) = -1\\)\n\nThe second-level differences are: 4, -5, -1.\n\nThe second-level differences don't form a simple pattern either. Let's try to find the next term in the sequence by assuming the pattern in the first-level differences continues. \n\nIf we assume the pattern in the first-level differences continues, the next difference might be \\(-7 - 1 = -8\\).\n\nLet's calculate the next term in the sequence using this assumption:\n\n- The next term would be \\(-15 - 8 = -23\\).\n\nTherefore, the next term in the sequence is \\(-23\\).\n\nThe value of \"?\" is \\(-23\\).\n\nSo, the output is:\n\n<<<-23>>>"
