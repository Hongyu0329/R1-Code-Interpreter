    "\nassistant > To find the pattern in the sequence \\(-7, -10, -23, -52, -123, ?\\), let's examine the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n1. \\(-10 - (-7) = -3\\)\n2. \\(-23 - (-10) = -13\\)\n3. \\(-52 - (-23) = -29\\)\n4. \\(-123 - (-52) = -71\\)\n\nNow, let's examine the differences between these differences:\n\n1. \\(-13 - (-3) = -10\\)\n2. \\(-29 - (-13) = -16\\)\n3. \\(-71 - (-29) = -42\\)\n\nThe second differences are \\(-10, -16, -42\\). Let's examine the differences between these:\n\n1. \\(-16 - (-10) = -6\\)\n2. \\(-42 - (-16) = -26\\)\n\nThe third differences are \\(-6, -26\\). Let's examine the differences between these:\n\n1. \\(-26 - (-6) = -20\\)\n\nThe fourth difference is \\(-20\\), which suggests that the differences are increasing by a pattern. Let's calculate the next difference and use it to find the next term in the sequence.\n\nThe next third difference would be \\(-26 - 20 = -46\\).\n\nNow, let's calculate the next second difference:\n\n\\(-42 - 46 = -88\\)\n\nNext, calculate the next first difference:\n\n\\(-71 - 88 = -159\\)\n\nFinally, calculate the next term in the sequence:\n\n\\(-123 - 159 = -282\\)\n\nThus, the next term in the sequence is \\(-282\\).\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is:\n\n<<<-282>>>"
