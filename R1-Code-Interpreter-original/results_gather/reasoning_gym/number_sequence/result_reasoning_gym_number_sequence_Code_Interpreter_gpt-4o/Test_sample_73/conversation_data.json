    "\nassistant > The sequence given is 9, 18, 36, 72, 144, and we need to find the next number in the sequence.\n\nLet's analyze the pattern:\n\n- 18 is 9 multiplied by 2.\n- 36 is 18 multiplied by 2.\n- 72 is 36 multiplied by 2.\n- 144 is 72 multiplied by 2.\n\nIt appears that each number is obtained by multiplying the previous number by 2.\n\nTherefore, the next number in the sequence should be 144 multiplied by 2.\n\nLet's calculate that.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Calculate the next number in the sequence\nnext_number = 144 * 2\nnext_number\nassistant > The next number in the sequence is 288. Therefore, the value of \"?\" is <<<288>>>."
