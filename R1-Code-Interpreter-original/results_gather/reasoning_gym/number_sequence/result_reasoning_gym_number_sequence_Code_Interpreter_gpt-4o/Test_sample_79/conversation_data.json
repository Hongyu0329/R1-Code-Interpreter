    "\nassistant > The sequence given is 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 192. \n\nTo find the pattern, let's examine the differences or ratios between consecutive terms:\n\n- \\(6 = 3 \\times 2\\)\n- \\(12 = 6 \\times 2\\)\n- \\(24 = 12 \\times 2\\)\n- \\(48 = 24 \\times 2\\)\n- \\(96 = 48 \\times 2\\)\n- \\(192 = 96 \\times 2\\)\n\nIt appears that each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by 2. Therefore, the next term in the sequence should be:\n\n\\[192 \\times 2 = 384\\]\n\nThus, the value of \"?\" is <<<384>>>."
