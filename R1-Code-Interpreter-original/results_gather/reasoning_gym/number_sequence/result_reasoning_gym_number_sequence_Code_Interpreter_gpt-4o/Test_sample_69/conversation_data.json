    "\nassistant > To find the pattern in the sequence 6, 6, 12, 18, ?, let's analyze the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n- The difference between the first and second terms is \\(6 - 6 = 0\\).\n- The difference between the second and third terms is \\(12 - 6 = 6\\).\n- The difference between the third and fourth terms is \\(18 - 12 = 6\\).\n\nIt seems that after the initial repetition of 6, the sequence increases by 6 each time. Therefore, the next term after 18 should be \\(18 + 6 = 24\\).\n\nThus, the value of \"?\" is 24.\n\nThe value of \"?\" is enclosed within triple angle brackets: <<<24>>>."
