    "\nassistant > The sequence given is \\(-1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, ?\\).\n\nObserving the sequence, it starts with \\(-1\\) and is followed by five \\(1\\)s. There is no apparent pattern of change after the initial \\(-1\\), as all subsequent numbers are \\(1\\).\n\nBased on this observation, it is reasonable to assume that the next number in the sequence is also \\(1\\).\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]\n\nSo, the value of \"?\" is enclosed within triple angle brackets as follows: <<<1>>>."
