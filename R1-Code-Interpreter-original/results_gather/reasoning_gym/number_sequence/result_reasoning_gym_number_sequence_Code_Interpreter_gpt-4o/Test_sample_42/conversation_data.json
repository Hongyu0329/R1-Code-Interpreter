    "\nassistant > The sequence given is \\(-1, -1, -2, -3, ?\\).\n\nTo find the pattern, let's look at the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n- The difference between the first and second term is \\(-1 - (-1) = 0\\).\n- The difference between the second and third term is \\(-2 - (-1) = -1\\).\n- The difference between the third and fourth term is \\(-3 - (-2) = -1\\).\n\nThe differences are \\(0, -1, -1\\). It seems that the sequence is decreasing by 0, then by 1, and then by 1 again. \n\nIf we continue this pattern, the next difference should be \\(-1\\).\n\nTherefore, the next term in the sequence should be \\(-3 - 1 = -4\\).\n\nSo, the value of \"?\" is \\(-4\\).\n\nThus, the value of \"?\" is enclosed within triple angle brackets: <<<-4>>>."
