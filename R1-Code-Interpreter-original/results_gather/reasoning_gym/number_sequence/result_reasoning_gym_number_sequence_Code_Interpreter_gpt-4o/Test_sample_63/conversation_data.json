    "\nassistant > The sequence given is \\(-9, -5, -3, -2, -1, ?\\).\n\nLet's examine the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n- \\(-5 - (-9) = 4\\)\n- \\(-3 - (-5) = 2\\)\n- \\(-2 - (-3) = 1\\)\n- \\(-1 - (-2) = 1\\)\n\nThe differences are \\(4, 2, 1, 1\\).\n\nIt seems that the differences are decreasing by 2, then by 1, and then remain constant. If we continue this pattern, the next difference should also be 1.\n\nTherefore, the next term in the sequence should be \\(-1 + 1 = 0\\).\n\nSo, the value of \"?\" is 0.\n\nThus, the answer is: <<<0>>>."
