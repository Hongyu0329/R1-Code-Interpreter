    "To solve the problem, we need to identify the pattern in the given sequence: 7, 14, 28, 56, 112, and then determine the next number in the sequence.\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   - Start by examining the relationship between consecutive numbers in the sequence.\n   - Calculate the ratio of each number to the previous number:\n     - \\( \\frac{14}{7} = 2 \\)\n     - \\( \\frac{28}{14} = 2 \\)\n     - \\( \\frac{56}{28} = 2 \\)\n     - \\( \\frac{112}{56} = 2 \\)\n\n2. **Determine the Rule:**\n   - From the calculations above, we observe that each number is obtained by multiplying the previous number by 2.\n   - This indicates that the sequence is a geometric progression with a common ratio of 2.\n\n3. **Apply the Rule to Find the Next Number:**\n   - To find the next number in the sequence, multiply the last known number (112) by the common ratio (2):\n     - \\( 112 \\times 2 = 224 \\)\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The next number in the sequence is 224.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is <<<224>>>."
