    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence and determine the next number.\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   - Look at the sequence: -5, -10, -20, -40, -80, -160, -320.\n   - Notice that each number is negative and appears to be doubling in magnitude.\n\n2. **Calculate the Differences:**\n   - Calculate the difference between consecutive terms:\n     - -10 - (-5) = -5\n     - -20 - (-10) = -10\n     - -40 - (-20) = -20\n     - -80 - (-40) = -40\n     - -160 - (-80) = -80\n     - -320 - (-160) = -160\n\n3. **Identify the Multiplicative Pattern:**\n   - Each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by 2:\n     - -5 * 2 = -10\n     - -10 * 2 = -20\n     - -20 * 2 = -40\n     - -40 * 2 = -80\n     - -80 * 2 = -160\n     - -160 * 2 = -320\n\n4. **Determine the Next Term:**\n   - Following the pattern, the next term should be -320 multiplied by 2:\n     - -320 * 2 = -640\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The next number in the sequence is -640.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is <<<-640>>>."
