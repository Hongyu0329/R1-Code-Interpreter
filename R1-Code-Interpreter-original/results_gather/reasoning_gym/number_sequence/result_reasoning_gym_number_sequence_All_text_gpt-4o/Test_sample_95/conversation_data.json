    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence and determine the next number.\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   - Look at the sequence: -4, -14, -24, -34, -44, -54.\n   - Calculate the difference between consecutive terms:\n     - Difference between -14 and -4: \\(-14 - (-4) = -10\\)\n     - Difference between -24 and -14: \\(-24 - (-14) = -10\\)\n     - Difference between -34 and -24: \\(-34 - (-24) = -10\\)\n     - Difference between -44 and -34: \\(-44 - (-34) = -10\\)\n     - Difference between -54 and -44: \\(-54 - (-44) = -10\\)\n\n2. **Determine the Pattern:**\n   - The sequence decreases by 10 each time. This is a consistent pattern.\n\n3. **Predict the Next Term:**\n   - The last term given is -54.\n   - To find the next term, subtract 10 from -54:\n     \\(-54 - 10 = -64\\)\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The next term in the sequence is -64.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is <<<-64>>>."
