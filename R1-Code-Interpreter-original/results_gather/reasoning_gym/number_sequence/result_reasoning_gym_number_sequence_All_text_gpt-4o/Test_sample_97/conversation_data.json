    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence of numbers: -7, -10, -23, -52, -123, and then determine the next number in the sequence.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the differences between consecutive terms.\n- The difference between -7 and -10 is -10 - (-7) = -3.\n- The difference between -10 and -23 is -23 - (-10) = -13.\n- The difference between -23 and -52 is -52 - (-23) = -29.\n- The difference between -52 and -123 is -123 - (-52) = -71.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the differences.\n- The differences are: -3, -13, -29, -71.\n- Let's calculate the differences between these differences to see if there's a second-level pattern:\n  - The difference between -3 and -13 is -13 - (-3) = -10.\n  - The difference between -13 and -29 is -29 - (-13) = -16.\n  - The difference between -29 and -71 is -71 - (-29) = -42.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the second-level differences.\n- The second-level differences are: -10, -16, -42.\n- Let's calculate the differences between these second-level differences:\n  - The difference between -10 and -16 is -16 - (-10) = -6.\n  - The difference between -16 and -42 is -42 - (-16) = -26.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the third-level differences.\n- The third-level differences are: -6, -26.\n- The difference between -6 and -26 is -26 - (-6) = -20.\n\nStep 5: Identify the pattern.\n- The third-level differences suggest a pattern of -6, -26, and potentially -46 (if we assume a consistent difference of -20).\n- If we assume the next third-level difference is -46, then the next second-level difference would be -42 - 46 = -88.\n\nStep 6: Calculate the next first-level difference.\n- If the next second-level difference is -88, then the next first-level difference would be -71 - 88 = -159.\n\nStep 7: Calculate the next term in the sequence.\n- If the next first-level difference is -159, then the next term in the sequence would be -123 - 159 = -282.\n\nTherefore, the next number in the sequence is -282.\n\nThe value of \"?\" is <<<-282>>>."
