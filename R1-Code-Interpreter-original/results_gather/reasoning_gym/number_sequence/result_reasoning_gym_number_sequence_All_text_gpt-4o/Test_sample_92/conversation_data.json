    "To determine the next number in the sequence -9, -6, -4, -3, -3, -3, ?, we need to analyze the pattern or rule governing the sequence. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the differences between consecutive terms:**\n   - The difference between -9 and -6 is 3.\n   - The difference between -6 and -4 is 2.\n   - The difference between -4 and -3 is 1.\n   - The difference between -3 and -3 is 0.\n   - The difference between -3 and -3 is 0.\n\n2. **Observe the pattern in the differences:**\n   - The differences are 3, 2, 1, 0, 0.\n   - The differences are decreasing by 1 until they reach 0, and then they remain constant at 0.\n\n3. **Predict the next difference:**\n   - Following the pattern, after two consecutive 0s, the next difference should also be 0.\n\n4. **Calculate the next term:**\n   - Since the last term is -3 and the next difference is 0, the next term should also be -3.\n\nTherefore, the next number in the sequence is -3.\n\nThe value of \"?\" is <<<-3>>>."
