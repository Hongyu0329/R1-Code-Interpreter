    "To solve the sequence problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that governs the progression of numbers. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Sequence:**\n   The given sequence is: -6, -6, -12, -18, ?\n\n2. **Examine the Differences:**\n   - The difference between the first and second term: -6 - (-6) = 0\n   - The difference between the second and third term: -12 - (-6) = -6\n   - The difference between the third and fourth term: -18 - (-12) = -6\n\n3. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   - The first difference is 0.\n   - The second and third differences are both -6.\n\n4. **Predict the Next Difference:**\n   - Based on the pattern, it seems that after the initial 0 difference, the sequence decreases by -6 consistently.\n\n5. **Calculate the Next Term:**\n   - The last known term is -18.\n   - If the pattern continues, the next difference should also be -6.\n   - Therefore, the next term is: -18 + (-6) = -24\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The sequence follows a pattern where the first difference is 0, and subsequent differences are -6.\n   - The next term in the sequence is -24.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is <<<-24>>>."
