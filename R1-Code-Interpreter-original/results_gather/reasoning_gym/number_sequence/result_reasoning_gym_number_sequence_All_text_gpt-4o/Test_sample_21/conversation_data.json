    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence of numbers: -4, -6, -10, -18, -34, -66, -130, and then determine the next number in the sequence.\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   - First, let's look at the differences between consecutive terms:\n     - Difference between -4 and -6: \\(-6 - (-4) = -2\\)\n     - Difference between -6 and -10: \\(-10 - (-6) = -4\\)\n     - Difference between -10 and -18: \\(-18 - (-10) = -8\\)\n     - Difference between -18 and -34: \\(-34 - (-18) = -16\\)\n     - Difference between -34 and -66: \\(-66 - (-34) = -32\\)\n     - Difference between -66 and -130: \\(-130 - (-66) = -64\\)\n\n2. **Analyze the Differences:**\n   - The differences are: -2, -4, -8, -16, -32, -64.\n   - Notice that each difference is a power of 2: \n     - \\(-2 = -2^1\\)\n     - \\(-4 = -2^2\\)\n     - \\(-8 = -2^3\\)\n     - \\(-16 = -2^4\\)\n     - \\(-32 = -2^5\\)\n     - \\(-64 = -2^6\\)\n\n3. **Predict the Next Difference:**\n   - Following the pattern, the next difference should be \\(-2^7 = -128\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the Next Term:**\n   - The last term in the sequence is -130.\n   - To find the next term, subtract the next difference from the last term:\n     - Next term = \\(-130 - (-128) = -130 - 128 = -258\\).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The next number in the sequence is -258.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is <<<-258>>>."
