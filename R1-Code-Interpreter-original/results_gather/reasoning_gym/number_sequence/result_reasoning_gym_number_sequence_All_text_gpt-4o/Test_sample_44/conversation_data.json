    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that governs the sequence of numbers: -9, -18, -36, -72, -144, -288, and then determine the next number in the sequence.\n\nStep 1: Identify the pattern\n- Start by examining the relationship between consecutive terms in the sequence.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the ratio between consecutive terms\n- Calculate the ratio of the second term to the first term: \\(-18 / -9 = 2\\).\n- Calculate the ratio of the third term to the second term: \\(-36 / -18 = 2\\).\n- Calculate the ratio of the fourth term to the third term: \\(-72 / -36 = 2\\).\n- Calculate the ratio of the fifth term to the fourth term: \\(-144 / -72 = 2\\).\n- Calculate the ratio of the sixth term to the fifth term: \\(-288 / -144 = 2\\).\n\nStep 3: Confirm the pattern\n- The ratio between each consecutive pair of terms is consistently 2, indicating that this is a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 2.\n\nStep 4: Determine the next term\n- To find the next term in the sequence, multiply the last known term by the common ratio.\n- The last known term is -288, and the common ratio is 2.\n- Calculate the next term: \\(-288 \\times 2 = -576\\).\n\nStep 5: Conclude the solution\n- The next term in the sequence is -576.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is <<<-576>>>."
