    "To solve the sequence problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that governs the progression of numbers. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Sequence**: The given sequence is 6, 6, 12, 18, ?.\n\n2. **Examine the Differences**: \n   - The difference between the first and second term (6 and 6) is 0.\n   - The difference between the second and third term (6 and 12) is 6.\n   - The difference between the third and fourth term (12 and 18) is 6.\n\n3. **Identify the Pattern**:\n   - The first two terms are the same, indicating a possible repetition or a starting point.\n   - From the second term onward, each subsequent term increases by 6.\n\n4. **Predict the Next Term**:\n   - Following the identified pattern, the difference between the fourth term (18) and the next term should also be 6.\n   - Therefore, the next term is 18 + 6 = 24.\n\n5. **Verify the Pattern**:\n   - The sequence starts with two identical numbers (6, 6).\n   - Then, each subsequent number increases by 6 (6, 12, 18, 24).\n\nThe pattern is consistent with the identified rule, confirming our prediction.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is 24.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<24>>>."
