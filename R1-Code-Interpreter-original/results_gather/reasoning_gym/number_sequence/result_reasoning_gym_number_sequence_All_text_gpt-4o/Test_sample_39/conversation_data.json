    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence and determine the next number. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Sequence:**\n   The given sequence is: -6, -6, -12, -18, -30, -48, -78, ?\n\n2. **Calculate the Differences:**\n   Let's find the differences between consecutive terms to see if there's a pattern:\n   - Difference between -6 and -6: 0\n   - Difference between -6 and -12: -6\n   - Difference between -12 and -18: -6\n   - Difference between -18 and -30: -12\n   - Difference between -30 and -48: -18\n   - Difference between -48 and -78: -30\n\n   The differences are: 0, -6, -6, -12, -18, -30\n\n3. **Analyze the Differences:**\n   The differences themselves form a sequence: 0, -6, -6, -12, -18, -30. Let's analyze this sequence:\n   - The first difference is 0.\n   - The second and third differences are both -6.\n   - The fourth difference is -12.\n   - The fifth difference is -18.\n   - The sixth difference is -30.\n\n   Notice that starting from the third difference, the differences are increasing by a pattern:\n   - From -6 to -12: -12 = -6 - 6\n   - From -12 to -18: -18 = -12 - 6\n   - From -18 to -30: -30 = -18 - 12\n\n   The differences are increasing by -6, -6, -12, which suggests a pattern of adding the previous difference to the current difference.\n\n4. **Predict the Next Difference:**\n   Following the pattern, the next difference after -30 should be:\n   - Next difference = -30 - 18 = -48\n\n5. **Calculate the Next Term:**\n   The last term in the sequence is -78. To find the next term, we add the next difference to -78:\n   - Next term = -78 + (-48) = -126\n\nTherefore, the next number in the sequence is -126.\n\nThe value of \"?\" is enclosed within triple angle brackets as requested:\n\n<<<-126>>>"
