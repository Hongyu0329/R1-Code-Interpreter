    "To analyze the sequence step by step, let's first observe the pattern:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   - The sequence given is: -6, 6, -6, 6, -6, 6, -6, 6, ?\n   - Notice that the sequence alternates between -6 and 6.\n\n2. **Determine the Alternating Pattern:**\n   - The first term is -6.\n   - The second term is 6.\n   - The third term is -6.\n   - The fourth term is 6.\n   - The fifth term is -6.\n   - The sixth term is 6.\n   - The seventh term is -6.\n   - The eighth term is 6.\n\n3. **Predict the Next Term:**\n   - Since the sequence alternates between -6 and 6, and the eighth term is 6, the ninth term should follow the pattern.\n   - The ninth term should be -6, as it follows the alternating pattern of -6, 6, -6, 6, etc.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The sequence is a simple alternating pattern between -6 and 6.\n   - The next term in the sequence, following the established pattern, is -6.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is:\n\n<<<-6>>>"
