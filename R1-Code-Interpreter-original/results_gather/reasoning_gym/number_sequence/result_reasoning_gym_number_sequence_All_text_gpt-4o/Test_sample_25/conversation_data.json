    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence and determine the next number. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Sequence:**\n   The given sequence is: -1, -4, -8, -15, -26, -44, -73, ?\n\n2. **Calculate the Differences:**\n   Let's find the differences between consecutive terms to see if there's a pattern:\n   - Difference between -4 and -1: -4 - (-1) = -3\n   - Difference between -8 and -4: -8 - (-4) = -4\n   - Difference between -15 and -8: -15 - (-8) = -7\n   - Difference between -26 and -15: -26 - (-15) = -11\n   - Difference between -44 and -26: -44 - (-26) = -18\n   - Difference between -73 and -44: -73 - (-44) = -29\n\n   The differences are: -3, -4, -7, -11, -18, -29\n\n3. **Analyze the Differences:**\n   Let's look at the differences between these differences:\n   - Difference between -4 and -3: -4 - (-3) = -1\n   - Difference between -7 and -4: -7 - (-4) = -3\n   - Difference between -11 and -7: -11 - (-7) = -4\n   - Difference between -18 and -11: -18 - (-11) = -7\n   - Difference between -29 and -18: -29 - (-18) = -11\n\n   The second-level differences are: -1, -3, -4, -7, -11\n\n4. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   The second-level differences are: -1, -3, -4, -7, -11. This sequence appears to be increasing by the differences: -2, -1, -3, -4. \n\n5. **Predict the Next Difference:**\n   Continuing the pattern of the second-level differences, the next difference should be -18 (since -11 - 7 = -18).\n\n6. **Calculate the Next Term:**\n   The last first-level difference was -29. Adding the next predicted second-level difference of -18 to -29 gives us:\n   - Next first-level difference: -29 + (-18) = -47\n\n7. **Find the Next Term in the Sequence:**\n   The last term in the sequence is -73. Adding the next first-level difference of -47 to -73 gives us:\n   - Next term: -73 + (-47) = -120\n\nTherefore, the next number in the sequence is -120.\n\nThe value of \"?\" is enclosed within triple angle brackets as requested:\n\n<<<-120>>>"
