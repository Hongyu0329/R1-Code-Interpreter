    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence of numbers: 10, 10, 20, 30, 50, 80, 130, ?.\n\nLet's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the differences between consecutive terms:**\n   - 10 to 10: difference is 0\n   - 10 to 20: difference is 10\n   - 20 to 30: difference is 10\n   - 30 to 50: difference is 20\n   - 50 to 80: difference is 30\n   - 80 to 130: difference is 50\n\n2. **Examine the differences:**\n   - The differences are: 0, 10, 10, 20, 30, 50.\n   - Notice that after the initial 0, the differences themselves form a sequence: 10, 10, 20, 30, 50.\n\n3. **Identify the pattern in the differences:**\n   - The differences seem to follow a pattern where each difference is the sum of the two preceding differences:\n     - 10 (first difference)\n     - 10 (second difference)\n     - 20 = 10 + 10\n     - 30 = 10 + 20\n     - 50 = 20 + 30\n\n4. **Predict the next difference:**\n   - Following the pattern, the next difference should be the sum of the last two differences: 30 + 50 = 80.\n\n5. **Calculate the next term in the sequence:**\n   - The last term given is 130.\n   - Add the predicted difference to the last term: 130 + 80 = 210.\n\nTherefore, the next term in the sequence, represented by \"?\", is 210.\n\nThe value of \"?\" is enclosed within triple angle brackets as requested:\n\n<<<210>>>"
