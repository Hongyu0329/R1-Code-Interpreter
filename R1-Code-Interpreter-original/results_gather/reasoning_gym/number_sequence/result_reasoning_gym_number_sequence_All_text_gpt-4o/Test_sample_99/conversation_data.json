    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence of numbers: 9, 9, 18, 27, 45, 72, 117, 189, ?.\n\nLet's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Observation**: The sequence starts with two 9s. This suggests that the sequence might involve some form of repetition or a specific rule that starts with these numbers.\n\n2. **Differences Between Terms**: Calculate the differences between consecutive terms to see if there's a pattern:\n   - 9 to 9: Difference = 0\n   - 9 to 18: Difference = 9\n   - 18 to 27: Difference = 9\n   - 27 to 45: Difference = 18\n   - 45 to 72: Difference = 27\n   - 72 to 117: Difference = 45\n   - 117 to 189: Difference = 72\n\n3. **Pattern in Differences**: The differences themselves form a sequence: 0, 9, 9, 18, 27, 45, 72. Notice that after the initial 0, the differences are the same as the sequence starting from the third term: 9, 18, 27, 45, 72. This suggests that the differences are following a pattern similar to the Fibonacci sequence, where each term is the sum of the two preceding terms.\n\n4. **Fibonacci-like Pattern**: Let's verify if the differences follow a Fibonacci-like pattern:\n   - 9 = 9 (first term)\n   - 18 = 9 + 9\n   - 27 = 9 + 18\n   - 45 = 18 + 27\n   - 72 = 27 + 45\n\n5. **Next Difference**: To find the next term in the sequence, we need to find the next difference using the Fibonacci-like pattern:\n   - Next difference = 45 + 72 = 117\n\n6. **Calculate the Next Term**: Add this difference to the last known term in the sequence:\n   - Last term = 189\n   - Next term = 189 + 117 = 306\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is 306.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<306>>>."
