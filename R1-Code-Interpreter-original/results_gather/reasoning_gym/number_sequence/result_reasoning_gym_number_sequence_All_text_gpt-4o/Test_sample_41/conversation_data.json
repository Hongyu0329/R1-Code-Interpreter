    "To solve the sequence problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that governs the progression of numbers. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Sequence:**\n   The given sequence is: -4, -8, -16, -32, ?\n\n2. **Look for a Pattern:**\n   - Start by examining the relationship between consecutive terms.\n   - From -4 to -8: The difference is -8 - (-4) = -4.\n   - From -8 to -16: The difference is -16 - (-8) = -8.\n   - From -16 to -32: The difference is -32 - (-16) = -16.\n\n3. **Identify the Rule:**\n   - Notice that each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by 2.\n   - -4 * 2 = -8\n   - -8 * 2 = -16\n   - -16 * 2 = -32\n\n4. **Apply the Rule to Find the Next Term:**\n   - To find the next term in the sequence, multiply the last known term (-32) by 2.\n   - -32 * 2 = -64\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The sequence follows a pattern where each term is double the previous term.\n   - Therefore, the next term in the sequence is -64.\n\nThe value of \"?\" is <<<-64>>>."
