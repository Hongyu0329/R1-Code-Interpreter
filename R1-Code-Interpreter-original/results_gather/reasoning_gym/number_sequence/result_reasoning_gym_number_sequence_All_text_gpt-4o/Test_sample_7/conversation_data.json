    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence and determine the next number. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Sequence**: The given sequence is 2, -2, -6, -10, -14, ?.\n\n2. **Calculate the Differences**: \n   - The difference between the first and second terms: -2 - 2 = -4\n   - The difference between the second and third terms: -6 - (-2) = -4\n   - The difference between the third and fourth terms: -10 - (-6) = -4\n   - The difference between the fourth and fifth terms: -14 - (-10) = -4\n\n3. **Identify the Pattern**: The differences between consecutive terms are consistent and equal to -4. This indicates that the sequence is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of -4.\n\n4. **Determine the Next Term**: \n   - The last known term in the sequence is -14.\n   - To find the next term, subtract the common difference from the last term: -14 - 4 = -18.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The next term in the sequence is -18.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is <<<-18>>>."
