    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence and determine the next number.\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   - Start by examining the differences between consecutive terms in the sequence.\n   - The sequence is: -5, -10, -20, -40, -80, -160, -320.\n\n2. **Calculate the Differences:**\n   - Difference between -5 and -10: -10 - (-5) = -5\n   - Difference between -10 and -20: -20 - (-10) = -10\n   - Difference between -20 and -40: -40 - (-20) = -20\n   - Difference between -40 and -80: -80 - (-40) = -40\n   - Difference between -80 and -160: -160 - (-80) = -80\n   - Difference between -160 and -320: -320 - (-160) = -160\n\n3. **Identify the Pattern in Differences:**\n   - The differences are: -5, -10, -20, -40, -80, -160.\n   - Notice that each difference is double the previous difference.\n\n4. **Determine the Next Difference:**\n   - Following the pattern, the next difference should be double the last difference.\n   - Last difference is -160, so the next difference is -160 * 2 = -320.\n\n5. **Calculate the Next Term:**\n   - The last term in the sequence is -320.\n   - Add the next difference to the last term to find the next term in the sequence.\n   - Next term = -320 + (-320) = -640.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The next term in the sequence is -640.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is <<<-640>>>."
