    "To solve the problem, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence and determine the next number. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Sequence**: The given sequence is -9, -14, -21, -32, ?.\n\n2. **Calculate the Differences**: \n   - The difference between the first and second terms: -14 - (-9) = -14 + 9 = -5.\n   - The difference between the second and third terms: -21 - (-14) = -21 + 14 = -7.\n   - The difference between the third and fourth terms: -32 - (-21) = -32 + 21 = -11.\n\n3. **Analyze the Differences**: \n   - The differences are -5, -7, and -11.\n   - Notice that these differences are not constant, so the sequence is not arithmetic.\n\n4. **Look for a Pattern in the Differences**:\n   - The differences themselves form a sequence: -5, -7, -11.\n   - Calculate the differences between these differences:\n     - The difference between -5 and -7: -7 - (-5) = -7 + 5 = -2.\n     - The difference between -7 and -11: -11 - (-7) = -11 + 7 = -4.\n\n5. **Identify the Pattern in the Second Differences**:\n   - The second differences are -2 and -4.\n   - These differences suggest a pattern where each difference is decreasing by 2.\n\n6. **Predict the Next Difference**:\n   - If the pattern continues, the next difference in the sequence of differences should be -11 - 4 = -15.\n\n7. **Calculate the Next Term in the Original Sequence**:\n   - The last known term in the sequence is -32.\n   - Add the next predicted difference to this term: -32 + (-15) = -32 - 15 = -47.\n\nTherefore, the next term in the sequence is -47.\n\nThe value of \"?\" is enclosed within triple angle brackets as follows:\n\n<<<-47>>>"
