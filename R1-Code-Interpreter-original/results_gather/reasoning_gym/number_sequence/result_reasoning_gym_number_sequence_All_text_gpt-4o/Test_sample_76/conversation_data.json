    "To solve the problem, we need to identify the pattern in the given sequence: -5, 5, -5, 5, -5, ?.\n\nStep 1: Observe the sequence.\n- The sequence alternates between -5 and 5.\n\nStep 2: Identify the pattern.\n- The first term is -5.\n- The second term is 5.\n- The third term is -5.\n- The fourth term is 5.\n- The fifth term is -5.\n\nStep 3: Determine the next term.\n- The sequence alternates between -5 and 5.\n- Since the fifth term is -5, the sixth term should follow the pattern and be 5.\n\nStep 4: Verify the pattern.\n- The sequence is: -5, 5, -5, 5, -5, 5.\n- The pattern of alternating -5 and 5 is consistent.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is 5.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<5>>>."
