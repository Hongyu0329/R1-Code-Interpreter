    "To solve the sequence problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that governs the progression of numbers. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Sequence:**\n   The given sequence is: 7, 7, 14, 21, 35, 56, ?\n\n2. **Look for Patterns:**\n   - The first two numbers are both 7.\n   - From the second number (7) to the third number (14), the sequence increases by 7.\n   - From the third number (14) to the fourth number (21), the sequence increases by 7.\n   - From the fourth number (21) to the fifth number (35), the sequence increases by 14.\n   - From the fifth number (35) to the sixth number (56), the sequence increases by 21.\n\n3. **Analyze the Differences:**\n   - Difference between 7 and 7: 0\n   - Difference between 7 and 14: 7\n   - Difference between 14 and 21: 7\n   - Difference between 21 and 35: 14\n   - Difference between 35 and 56: 21\n\n4. **Identify the Pattern in Differences:**\n   - The differences themselves form a sequence: 0, 7, 7, 14, 21\n   - Notice that starting from the third difference (7), the differences are increasing by 7 each time: 7, 14, 21\n\n5. **Predict the Next Difference:**\n   - Following the pattern of increasing by 7, the next difference after 21 should be 28.\n\n6. **Calculate the Next Number:**\n   - Add the predicted difference (28) to the last number in the sequence (56):\n     - 56 + 28 = 84\n\nTherefore, the next number in the sequence is 84.\n\nThe value of \"?\" is enclosed within triple angle brackets as requested:\n\n<<<84>>>"
