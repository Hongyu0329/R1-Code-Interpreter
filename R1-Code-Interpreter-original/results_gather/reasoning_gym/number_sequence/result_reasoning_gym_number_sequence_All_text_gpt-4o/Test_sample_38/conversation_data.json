    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence and determine the next number. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Sequence Given**: 2, 2, 4, 6, 10, 16, ?\n\n2. **Identify the Pattern**:\n   - Start by looking at the differences between consecutive terms:\n     - Difference between 2 and 2: \\(2 - 2 = 0\\)\n     - Difference between 2 and 4: \\(4 - 2 = 2\\)\n     - Difference between 4 and 6: \\(6 - 4 = 2\\)\n     - Difference between 6 and 10: \\(10 - 6 = 4\\)\n     - Difference between 10 and 16: \\(16 - 10 = 6\\)\n\n3. **Analyze the Differences**:\n   - The differences are: 0, 2, 2, 4, 6\n   - Notice that starting from the second difference, the differences themselves form a sequence: 2, 2, 4, 6\n   - This sequence of differences appears to be increasing by 2 each time after the initial repetition of 2.\n\n4. **Predict the Next Difference**:\n   - Following the pattern of the differences (2, 2, 4, 6), the next difference should be \\(6 + 2 = 8\\).\n\n5. **Calculate the Next Term**:\n   - The last term in the sequence is 16.\n   - Add the predicted next difference to the last term: \\(16 + 8 = 24\\).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The next number in the sequence is 24.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is:\n\n<<<24>>>"
