    "To solve the problem, we need to identify the pattern in the given sequence and determine the next number.\n\n1. **Identify the Sequence Pattern:**\n   - The sequence provided is: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ?\n   - Let's examine the differences between consecutive terms:\n     - 2 - 0 = 2\n     - 4 - 2 = 2\n     - 6 - 4 = 2\n     - 8 - 6 = 2\n     - 10 - 8 = 2\n\n2. **Determine the Pattern:**\n   - The difference between each consecutive term is constant and equal to 2.\n   - This indicates that the sequence is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2.\n\n3. **Find the Next Term:**\n   - The last known term in the sequence is 10.\n   - To find the next term, add the common difference to the last term:\n     - Next term = 10 + 2 = 12\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The next term in the sequence, represented by \"?\", is 12.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is <<<12>>>."
