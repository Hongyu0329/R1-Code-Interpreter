    "To analyze the sequence and determine the next number, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Sequence**: The given sequence is 4, 8, 16, 32, 64.\n\n2. **Look for Patterns**: \n   - Check if the sequence is arithmetic (constant difference between terms).\n     - Difference between 8 and 4 is 4.\n     - Difference between 16 and 8 is 8.\n     - Difference between 32 and 16 is 16.\n     - Difference between 64 and 32 is 32.\n   - The differences are not constant, so it is not an arithmetic sequence.\n\n3. **Check for Geometric Sequence**:\n   - A geometric sequence has a constant ratio between consecutive terms.\n   - Calculate the ratio between consecutive terms:\n     - Ratio of 8 to 4 is 2.\n     - Ratio of 16 to 8 is 2.\n     - Ratio of 32 to 16 is 2.\n     - Ratio of 64 to 32 is 2.\n   - The ratio is constant (2), indicating a geometric sequence.\n\n4. **Determine the Next Term**:\n   - In a geometric sequence, each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by the common ratio.\n   - The last known term is 64.\n   - Multiply 64 by the common ratio (2) to find the next term:\n     - 64 * 2 = 128.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The next term in the sequence is 128.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is <<<128>>>."
