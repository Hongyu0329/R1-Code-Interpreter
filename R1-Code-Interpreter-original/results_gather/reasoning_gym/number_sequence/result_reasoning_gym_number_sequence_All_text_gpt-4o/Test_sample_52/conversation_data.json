    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or sequence rule that generates the given numbers: 4, 15, 30, 56, 97, and then determine the next number in the sequence.\n\nStep 1: Look for differences between consecutive terms.\n- Difference between 15 and 4: 15 - 4 = 11\n- Difference between 30 and 15: 30 - 15 = 15\n- Difference between 56 and 30: 56 - 30 = 26\n- Difference between 97 and 56: 97 - 56 = 41\n\nStep 2: Analyze the differences.\nThe differences are: 11, 15, 26, 41.\n\nStep 3: Look for a pattern in the differences.\n- Difference between 15 and 11: 15 - 11 = 4\n- Difference between 26 and 15: 26 - 15 = 11\n- Difference between 41 and 26: 41 - 26 = 15\n\nThe differences of the differences are: 4, 11, 15.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the second-level differences.\nThe second-level differences are: 4, 11, 15.\n\nStep 5: Look for a pattern in the second-level differences.\n- Difference between 11 and 4: 11 - 4 = 7\n- Difference between 15 and 11: 15 - 11 = 4\n\nThe third-level differences are: 7, 4.\n\nStep 6: Predict the next second-level difference.\nAssuming the pattern of third-level differences continues, the next difference should be 7 (since it alternates between 7 and 4).\n\nStep 7: Calculate the next first-level difference.\nThe last second-level difference was 15, and we predict the next one to be 15 + 7 = 22.\n\nStep 8: Calculate the next number in the sequence.\nThe last number in the sequence is 97, and the next first-level difference is 41 + 22 = 63.\n\nTherefore, the next number in the sequence is 97 + 63 = 160.\n\nThe value of \"?\" is <<<160>>>."
