    "To solve the sequence problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that governs the progression of numbers. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Sequence:**\n   The given sequence is: -8, -8, -16, -24, -40, ?\n\n2. **Calculate the Differences:**\n   To find a pattern, let's calculate the differences between consecutive terms:\n   - Difference between the 1st and 2nd term: -8 - (-8) = 0\n   - Difference between the 2nd and 3rd term: -16 - (-8) = -8\n   - Difference between the 3rd and 4th term: -24 - (-16) = -8\n   - Difference between the 4th and 5th term: -40 - (-24) = -16\n\n3. **Analyze the Differences:**\n   The differences between the terms are: 0, -8, -8, -16.\n   - The first difference is 0.\n   - The second and third differences are both -8.\n   - The fourth difference is -16.\n\n4. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   The differences themselves seem to follow a pattern:\n   - The first difference is 0.\n   - The second and third differences are the same (-8).\n   - The fourth difference is double the previous difference (-16 is double -8).\n\n5. **Predict the Next Difference:**\n   If the pattern continues, the next difference should be double the previous difference of -16, which would be -32.\n\n6. **Calculate the Next Term:**\n   To find the next term in the sequence, add the predicted difference to the last known term:\n   - Last known term: -40\n   - Predicted difference: -32\n   - Next term: -40 + (-32) = -72\n\nTherefore, the next term in the sequence is -72.\n\nThe value of \"?\" is enclosed within triple angle brackets as requested:\n\n<<<-72>>>"
