    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence and use it to find the next term. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Sequence:**\n   The given sequence is: 10, -20, 40, -80, 160, -320, ?\n\n2. **Observe the Pattern:**\n   - From 10 to -20: The number is multiplied by -2 (10 * -2 = -20).\n   - From -20 to 40: The number is multiplied by -2 (-20 * -2 = 40).\n   - From 40 to -80: The number is multiplied by -2 (40 * -2 = -80).\n   - From -80 to 160: The number is multiplied by -2 (-80 * -2 = 160).\n   - From 160 to -320: The number is multiplied by -2 (160 * -2 = -320).\n\n3. **Determine the Pattern:**\n   The pattern is that each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by -2.\n\n4. **Apply the Pattern to Find the Next Term:**\n   - The last known term is -320.\n   - Multiply -320 by -2 to find the next term: \n     -320 * -2 = 640.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   The next term in the sequence is 640.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is:\n\n<<<640>>>"
