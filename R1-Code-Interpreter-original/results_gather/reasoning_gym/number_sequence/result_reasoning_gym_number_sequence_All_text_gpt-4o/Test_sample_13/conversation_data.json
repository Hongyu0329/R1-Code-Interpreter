    "To analyze the sequence -6, 15, -6, 15, ?, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   - The sequence given is: -6, 15, -6, 15, ?\n   - Observe the numbers: -6, 15, -6, 15. \n\n2. **Look for Repetition:**\n   - The sequence appears to repeat every two numbers: -6, 15.\n   - The first number is -6, the second is 15, and this pattern repeats.\n\n3. **Predict the Next Number:**\n   - Since the sequence repeats every two numbers, the next number after 15 should be the same as the first number in the sequence.\n   - The first number in the sequence is -6.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The sequence is alternating between -6 and 15.\n   - Therefore, the next number in the sequence should be -6.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the value of \"?\".\n\nThe value of \"?\" is <<<-6>>>."
