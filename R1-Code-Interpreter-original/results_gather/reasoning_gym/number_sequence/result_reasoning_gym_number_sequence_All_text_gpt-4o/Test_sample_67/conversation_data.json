    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence and use it to find the next term. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Sequence:**\n   The given sequence is: 6, -12, 24, -48, 96, -192, 384, ?\n\n2. **Observe the Pattern:**\n   - The sequence alternates between positive and negative numbers.\n   - Each term seems to be a multiple of the previous term.\n\n3. **Calculate the Ratios:**\n   - From 6 to -12: \\(-12 / 6 = -2\\)\n   - From -12 to 24: \\(24 / -12 = -2\\)\n   - From 24 to -48: \\(-48 / 24 = -2\\)\n   - From -48 to 96: \\(96 / -48 = -2\\)\n   - From 96 to -192: \\(-192 / 96 = -2\\)\n   - From -192 to 384: \\(384 / -192 = -2\\)\n\n4. **Determine the Pattern:**\n   - Each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by \\(-2\\).\n\n5. **Apply the Pattern to Find the Next Term:**\n   - The last known term is 384.\n   - Multiply 384 by \\(-2\\) to find the next term: \\(384 \\times -2 = -768\\).\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   The next term in the sequence is \\(-768\\).\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is \\(-768\\).\n\nThe final answer is: <<<-768>>>."
