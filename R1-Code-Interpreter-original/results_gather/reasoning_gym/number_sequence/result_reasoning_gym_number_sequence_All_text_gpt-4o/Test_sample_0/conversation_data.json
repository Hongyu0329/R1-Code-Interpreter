    "To solve this sequence problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that governs the progression of numbers. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the sequence**: The given sequence is 6, 13, 26, 46, 79, ?.\n\n2. **Calculate the differences between consecutive terms**:\n   - Difference between 13 and 6: \\(13 - 6 = 7\\)\n   - Difference between 26 and 13: \\(26 - 13 = 13\\)\n   - Difference between 46 and 26: \\(46 - 26 = 20\\)\n   - Difference between 79 and 46: \\(79 - 46 = 33\\)\n\n3. **Analyze the differences**: The differences between consecutive terms are 7, 13, 20, and 33.\n\n4. **Calculate the differences of the differences**:\n   - Difference between 13 and 7: \\(13 - 7 = 6\\)\n   - Difference between 20 and 13: \\(20 - 13 = 7\\)\n   - Difference between 33 and 20: \\(33 - 20 = 13\\)\n\n5. **Identify the pattern in the second-level differences**: The second-level differences are 6, 7, and 13. These differences suggest a pattern that might be related to a known sequence or a simple arithmetic progression.\n\n6. **Predict the next second-level difference**: The second-level differences (6, 7, 13) do not form a simple arithmetic sequence, but they suggest a pattern of increasing differences. Let's assume the next difference follows a similar pattern. If we consider the differences as increasing by 1, 6, then the next difference could be 20 (since 13 + 7 = 20).\n\n7. **Calculate the next first-level difference**: If the next second-level difference is 20, then the next first-level difference would be:\n   - \\(33 + 20 = 53\\)\n\n8. **Calculate the next term in the sequence**: Add the next first-level difference to the last known term in the sequence:\n   - \\(79 + 53 = 132\\)\n\nTherefore, the next term in the sequence is 132.\n\nThe value of \"?\" is enclosed within triple angle brackets as requested:\n\n<<<132>>>"
