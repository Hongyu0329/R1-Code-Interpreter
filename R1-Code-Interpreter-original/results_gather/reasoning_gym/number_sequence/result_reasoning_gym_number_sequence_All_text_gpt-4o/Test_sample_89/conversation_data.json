    "To solve this sequence problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that governs the progression of numbers. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Sequence:**\n   The given sequence is: -5, -5, -10, -15, -25, -40, ?\n\n2. **Calculate the Differences:**\n   To find a pattern, let's calculate the differences between consecutive terms:\n   - Difference between the 1st and 2nd term: -5 - (-5) = 0\n   - Difference between the 2nd and 3rd term: -10 - (-5) = -5\n   - Difference between the 3rd and 4th term: -15 - (-10) = -5\n   - Difference between the 4th and 5th term: -25 - (-15) = -10\n   - Difference between the 5th and 6th term: -40 - (-25) = -15\n\n3. **Analyze the Differences:**\n   The differences are: 0, -5, -5, -10, -15\n\n4. **Identify the Pattern in Differences:**\n   The differences themselves form a sequence: 0, -5, -5, -10, -15\n   - The first difference is 0.\n   - The second and third differences are both -5.\n   - The fourth difference is -10.\n   - The fifth difference is -15.\n\n5. **Observe the Pattern:**\n   The differences seem to be increasing by -5 after the initial 0:\n   - Start with 0\n   - Then -5\n   - Then another -5\n   - Then -10\n   - Then -15\n\n6. **Predict the Next Difference:**\n   Following the pattern, the next difference should be -20 (since -15 + (-5) = -20).\n\n7. **Calculate the Next Term:**\n   The last known term in the sequence is -40. To find the next term, add the predicted difference to -40:\n   - Next term = -40 + (-20) = -60\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is -60.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<-60>>>"
