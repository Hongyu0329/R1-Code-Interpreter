    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence of numbers provided. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Sequence Analysis**: The given sequence is: -7, -1, -5, -1, -3, 0, 0, 3, ?\n\n2. **Identify Differences**: Calculate the differences between consecutive terms to see if there's a pattern:\n   - Difference between -7 and -1: \\(-1 - (-7) = 6\\)\n   - Difference between -1 and -5: \\(-5 - (-1) = -4\\)\n   - Difference between -5 and -1: \\(-1 - (-5) = 4\\)\n   - Difference between -1 and -3: \\(-3 - (-1) = -2\\)\n   - Difference between -3 and 0: \\(0 - (-3) = 3\\)\n   - Difference between 0 and 0: \\(0 - 0 = 0\\)\n   - Difference between 0 and 3: \\(3 - 0 = 3\\)\n\n3. **Pattern Recognition**: The differences are: 6, -4, 4, -2, 3, 0, 3. Let's look for a pattern:\n   - The differences alternate between positive and negative, with a decreasing absolute value: 6, -4, 4, -2, 3, 0, 3.\n   - The positive differences are: 6, 4, 3, 3.\n   - The negative differences are: -4, -2, 0.\n\n4. **Predict the Next Difference**: \n   - The last positive difference was 3, and the last negative difference was 0.\n   - If the pattern continues, the next difference should be negative and follow the sequence of negative differences: -4, -2, 0. The next logical step in this sequence is -1.\n\n5. **Calculate the Next Term**: \n   - The last term in the sequence is 3.\n   - If the next difference is -1, then the next term is: \\(3 + (-1) = 2\\).\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is 2.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<2>>>."
