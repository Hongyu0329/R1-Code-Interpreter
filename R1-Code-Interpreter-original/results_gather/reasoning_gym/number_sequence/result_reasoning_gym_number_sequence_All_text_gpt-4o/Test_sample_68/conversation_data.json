    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence and use it to determine the next number. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Sequence Pattern:**\n   - The given sequence is: -3, -6, -12, -24, -48, -96, ?\n   - We need to determine how each term is related to the previous term.\n\n2. **Calculate the Differences or Ratios:**\n   - Calculate the ratio between consecutive terms to see if there is a consistent pattern:\n     - From -3 to -6: \\(-6 / -3 = 2\\)\n     - From -6 to -12: \\(-12 / -6 = 2\\)\n     - From -12 to -24: \\(-24 / -12 = 2\\)\n     - From -24 to -48: \\(-48 / -24 = 2\\)\n     - From -48 to -96: \\(-96 / -48 = 2\\)\n\n3. **Determine the Pattern:**\n   - The sequence is a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 2 to get the next term.\n\n4. **Apply the Pattern to Find the Next Term:**\n   - The last known term is -96.\n   - Multiply -96 by 2 to find the next term:\n     - \\(-96 \\times 2 = -192\\)\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The next term in the sequence is -192.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is:\n\n<<<-192>>>"
