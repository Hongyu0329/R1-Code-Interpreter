    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the given sequence and use it to find the next term. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Sequence Pattern:**\n   - The sequence given is: 1, -3, 9, -27, 81, -243, ?\n   - Notice that the signs of the numbers alternate between positive and negative.\n\n2. **Examine the Absolute Values:**\n   - The absolute values of the sequence are: 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243\n   - These numbers are powers of 3: \n     - \\(3^0 = 1\\)\n     - \\(3^1 = 3\\)\n     - \\(3^2 = 9\\)\n     - \\(3^3 = 27\\)\n     - \\(3^4 = 81\\)\n     - \\(3^5 = 243\\)\n\n3. **Determine the Pattern:**\n   - The sequence is alternating in sign and increasing in powers of 3.\n   - The pattern for the signs is: positive, negative, positive, negative, positive, negative.\n\n4. **Predict the Next Term:**\n   - The next term in the sequence should follow the established pattern.\n   - The next power of 3 after \\(3^5\\) is \\(3^6\\).\n   - Calculate \\(3^6\\): \n     - \\(3^6 = 729\\)\n   - Since the last term, -243, is negative, the next term should be positive.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The next term in the sequence is \\(3^6\\) with a positive sign.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is:\n\n<<<729>>>"
