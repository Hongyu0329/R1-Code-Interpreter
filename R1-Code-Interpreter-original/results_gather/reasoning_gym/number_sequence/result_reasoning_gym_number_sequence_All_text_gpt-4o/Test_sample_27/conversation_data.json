    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence of numbers. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Sequence**: The given sequence is 5, 19, 33, 47, 61, 75, 89, ?.\n\n2. **Calculate the Differences**: To find the pattern, calculate the differences between consecutive terms:\n   - 19 - 5 = 14\n   - 33 - 19 = 14\n   - 47 - 33 = 14\n   - 61 - 47 = 14\n   - 75 - 61 = 14\n   - 89 - 75 = 14\n\n3. **Observe the Pattern**: The differences between consecutive terms are constant, each being 14. This indicates that the sequence is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 14.\n\n4. **Determine the Next Term**: To find the next term in the sequence, add the common difference to the last known term:\n   - Next term = 89 + 14 = 103\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The next term in the sequence is 103.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is:\n\n<<<103>>>"
