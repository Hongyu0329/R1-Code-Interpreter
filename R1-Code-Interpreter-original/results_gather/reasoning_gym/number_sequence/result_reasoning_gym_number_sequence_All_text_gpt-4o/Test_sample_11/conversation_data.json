    "To solve the problem, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence and determine the next number.\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   - Look at the sequence: 8, 14, 20, 26, 32, 38, 44.\n   - Calculate the difference between consecutive terms:\n     - 14 - 8 = 6\n     - 20 - 14 = 6\n     - 26 - 20 = 6\n     - 32 - 26 = 6\n     - 38 - 32 = 6\n     - 44 - 38 = 6\n\n2. **Determine the Pattern:**\n   - The difference between each consecutive term is constant, which is 6.\n   - This indicates that the sequence is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6.\n\n3. **Find the Next Term:**\n   - The last term given is 44.\n   - To find the next term, add the common difference to the last term:\n     - Next term = 44 + 6 = 50\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The next number in the sequence is 50.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is <<<50>>>."
