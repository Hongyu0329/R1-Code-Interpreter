    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence of numbers: -9, -3, -10, -6, -12, -9, -15, ?.\n\nLet's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the differences between consecutive terms:**\n   - From -9 to -3: The difference is +6.\n   - From -3 to -10: The difference is -7.\n   - From -10 to -6: The difference is +4.\n   - From -6 to -12: The difference is -6.\n   - From -12 to -9: The difference is +3.\n   - From -9 to -15: The difference is -6.\n\n2. **Observe the pattern in the differences:**\n   - The differences are: +6, -7, +4, -6, +3, -6.\n   - Notice that the differences alternate between positive and negative values, and there seems to be a repeating pattern.\n\n3. **Look for a repeating pattern:**\n   - The differences can be grouped as: (+6, -7), (+4, -6), (+3, -6).\n   - The negative differences are consistently -6 after every positive difference, except for the first pair.\n\n4. **Predict the next difference:**\n   - The last difference was -6 (from -9 to -15).\n   - Following the observed pattern, after a -6, the next difference should be a positive number.\n   - The sequence of positive differences observed is +6, +4, +3. It appears to decrease by 2 each time.\n\n5. **Calculate the next positive difference:**\n   - The last positive difference was +3.\n   - If the pattern continues, the next positive difference should be +1 (decreasing by 2 from +3).\n\n6. **Apply the next difference to find the missing term:**\n   - The last term in the sequence is -15.\n   - Add the next positive difference (+1) to -15: \n     -15 + 1 = -14.\n\nTherefore, the missing term in the sequence is -14.\n\nThe value of \"?\" is <<<-14>>>."
