    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence and determine the next number.\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   - The sequence given is: -1, -2, -4, -8, -16, -32.\n   - Observe the relationship between consecutive terms.\n\n2. **Calculate the Differences:**\n   - From -1 to -2: The difference is -1.\n   - From -2 to -4: The difference is -2.\n   - From -4 to -8: The difference is -4.\n   - From -8 to -16: The difference is -8.\n   - From -16 to -32: The difference is -16.\n\n3. **Identify the Rule:**\n   - Each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by 2.\n   - Specifically, each term is double the previous term, but negative, which means each term is multiplied by -2.\n\n4. **Apply the Rule to Find the Next Term:**\n   - The last term given is -32.\n   - Multiply -32 by 2 to find the next term: -32 * 2 = -64.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The next term in the sequence is -64.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is <<<-64>>>."
