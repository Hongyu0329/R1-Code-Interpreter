    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence of numbers: 5, 5, 10, 15, 25, 40, 65, ?.\n\nLet's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the differences between consecutive terms:**\n   - 5 to 5: Difference = 0\n   - 5 to 10: Difference = 5\n   - 10 to 15: Difference = 5\n   - 15 to 25: Difference = 10\n   - 25 to 40: Difference = 15\n   - 40 to 65: Difference = 25\n\n2. **Examine the differences:**\n   - The differences are: 0, 5, 5, 10, 15, 25.\n   - Notice that after the initial 0, the differences themselves form a sequence: 5, 5, 10, 15, 25.\n\n3. **Identify the pattern in the differences:**\n   - The differences after the initial 0 are: 5, 5, 10, 15, 25.\n   - These differences appear to be increasing in a specific pattern.\n   - Let's look at the differences between these differences:\n     - 5 to 5: Difference = 0\n     - 5 to 10: Difference = 5\n     - 10 to 15: Difference = 5\n     - 15 to 25: Difference = 10\n\n4. **Examine the second-level differences:**\n   - The second-level differences are: 0, 5, 5, 10.\n   - This sequence suggests a pattern where the differences are increasing by 5 after the initial 0.\n\n5. **Predict the next difference:**\n   - Following the pattern of the second-level differences (0, 5, 5, 10), the next difference should be 15.\n\n6. **Calculate the next term in the sequence:**\n   - The last term in the sequence is 65.\n   - The next difference, based on our pattern, is 25 + 15 = 40.\n   - Therefore, the next term is 65 + 40 = 105.\n\nThus, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is 105.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<105>>>."
