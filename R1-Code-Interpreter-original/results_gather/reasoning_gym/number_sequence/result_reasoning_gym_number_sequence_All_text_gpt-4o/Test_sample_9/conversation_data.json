    "To determine the value of \"?\" in the sequence -10, -3, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, ?, we need to analyze the pattern of the sequence step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the Sequence Pattern:**\n   - The sequence starts with -10, then -3, and then a series of -1s.\n   - The first two numbers, -10 and -3, suggest a change in value, while the subsequent numbers are all -1.\n\n2. **Calculate the Differences:**\n   - The difference between the first two numbers is: \n     \\[\n     -3 - (-10) = 7\n     \\]\n   - The difference between the second and third numbers is:\n     \\[\n     -1 - (-3) = 2\n     \\]\n   - The difference between each subsequent number is:\n     \\[\n     -1 - (-1) = 0\n     \\]\n\n3. **Analyze the Differences:**\n   - The differences are 7, 2, and then 0 for the rest of the sequence.\n   - The sequence seems to decrease the difference by 5 (from 7 to 2) and then stabilize at 0.\n\n4. **Predict the Next Number:**\n   - Since the difference has stabilized at 0, the next number in the sequence should be the same as the previous number, which is -1.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The pattern suggests that the sequence will continue with -1.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is -1.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<-1>>>."
