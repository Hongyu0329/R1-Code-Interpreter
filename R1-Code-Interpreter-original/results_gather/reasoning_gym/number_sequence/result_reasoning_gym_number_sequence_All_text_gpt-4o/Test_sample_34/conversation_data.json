    "To analyze the sequence step by step, let's first identify the pattern:\n\n1. **Identify the Sequence Pattern:**\n   - The given sequence is: -1, -2, -4, -8, -16, -32, -64, ?\n   - Observe the relationship between consecutive terms.\n\n2. **Calculate the Ratio Between Consecutive Terms:**\n   - From -1 to -2: \\(-2 / -1 = 2\\)\n   - From -2 to -4: \\(-4 / -2 = 2\\)\n   - From -4 to -8: \\(-8 / -4 = 2\\)\n   - From -8 to -16: \\(-16 / -8 = 2\\)\n   - From -16 to -32: \\(-32 / -16 = 2\\)\n   - From -32 to -64: \\(-64 / -32 = 2\\)\n\n3. **Determine the Pattern:**\n   - Each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by 2.\n   - This is a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 2.\n\n4. **Calculate the Next Term:**\n   - The last known term is -64.\n   - Multiply -64 by the common ratio (2) to find the next term.\n   - \\(-64 \\times 2 = -128\\)\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The next term in the sequence is -128.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is <<<-128>>>."
