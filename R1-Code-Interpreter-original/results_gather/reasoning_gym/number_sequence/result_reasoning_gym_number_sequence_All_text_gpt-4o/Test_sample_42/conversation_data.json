    "To analyze the sequence step by step, we need to identify the pattern or rule that governs the progression of numbers. Let's examine the sequence:\n\n- The sequence given is: -1, -1, -2, -3, ?\n\n1. **Identify the differences between consecutive terms:**\n   - The difference between the first term (-1) and the second term (-1) is 0.\n   - The difference between the second term (-1) and the third term (-2) is -1.\n   - The difference between the third term (-2) and the fourth term (-3) is -1.\n\n2. **Look for a pattern in the differences:**\n   - The differences are: 0, -1, -1.\n   - The pattern in the differences seems to be that after the initial 0, each subsequent difference is -1.\n\n3. **Predict the next difference:**\n   - If the pattern continues, the next difference should also be -1.\n\n4. **Apply the predicted difference to find the next term:**\n   - The last known term in the sequence is -3.\n   - Applying the predicted difference of -1 to -3 gives us: -3 + (-1) = -4.\n\n5. **Verify the pattern:**\n   - The sequence with the predicted next term is: -1, -1, -2, -3, -4.\n   - The differences are: 0, -1, -1, -1, which matches the identified pattern.\n\nTherefore, the next term in the sequence is -4.\n\nThe value of \"?\" is <<<-4>>>."
