    "To determine the value of \"?\" in the sequence -7, -8, -8, -8, -8, -8, -8, ?, we need to analyze the pattern of the sequence step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   - The sequence starts with -7 and is followed by several -8s.\n   - The sequence is: -7, -8, -8, -8, -8, -8, -8, ?\n\n2. **Count the Occurrences:**\n   - The number -8 appears six times consecutively after the initial -7.\n\n3. **Consider the Possibility of a Repeating Pattern:**\n   - If the sequence is following a simple repeating pattern, it might be alternating between -7 and a series of -8s.\n   - However, since there is only one -7 and six -8s, it suggests that the sequence might be designed to continue with -8s.\n\n4. **Predict the Next Number:**\n   - Given the pattern observed, the sequence appears to be a series of -8s following the initial -7.\n   - There is no indication of a change in the pattern or a return to -7.\n\n5. **Conclude the Pattern:**\n   - The sequence likely continues with another -8, as there is no evidence of a different number appearing after the series of -8s.\n\nBased on this analysis, the value of \"?\" is likely to be -8.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is <<<-8>>>."
