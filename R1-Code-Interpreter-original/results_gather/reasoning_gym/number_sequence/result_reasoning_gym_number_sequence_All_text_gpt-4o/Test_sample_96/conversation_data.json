    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence of numbers. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Sequence:**\n   The given sequence is: -2, -2, -4, -6, -10, -16, -26, -42, ?\n\n2. **Look for Patterns:**\n   We need to determine how each number in the sequence is derived from the previous numbers. Let's examine the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n   - Difference between -2 and -2: 0\n   - Difference between -2 and -4: -2\n   - Difference between -4 and -6: -2\n   - Difference between -6 and -10: -4\n   - Difference between -10 and -16: -6\n   - Difference between -16 and -26: -10\n   - Difference between -26 and -42: -16\n\n3. **Analyze the Differences:**\n   The differences themselves form a sequence: 0, -2, -2, -4, -6, -10, -16\n\n4. **Look for a Pattern in the Differences:**\n   Let's examine the differences between these differences:\n\n   - Difference between 0 and -2: -2\n   - Difference between -2 and -2: 0\n   - Difference between -2 and -4: -2\n   - Difference between -4 and -6: -2\n   - Difference between -6 and -10: -4\n   - Difference between -10 and -16: -6\n\n   The second-level differences are: -2, 0, -2, -2, -4, -6\n\n5. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   The second-level differences suggest a pattern: -2, 0, -2, -2, -4, -6. This pattern seems to be increasing by -2 after the initial 0.\n\n6. **Predict the Next Difference:**\n   Following the pattern of the second-level differences, the next difference should be -8 (since -6 - 2 = -8).\n\n7. **Calculate the Next Term:**\n   The last known term in the sequence is -42. The last difference was -16. The next difference, as predicted, is -16 - 8 = -24.\n\n   Therefore, the next term in the sequence is:\n   -42 + (-24) = -66\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   The value of \"?\" in the sequence is -66.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<-66>>>"
