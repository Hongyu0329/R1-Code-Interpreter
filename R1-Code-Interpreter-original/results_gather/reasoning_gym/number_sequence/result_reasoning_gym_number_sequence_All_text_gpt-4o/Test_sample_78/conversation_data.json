    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the given sequence and use it to determine the next number.\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   - Look at the sequence: 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320.\n   - Notice that each number is double the previous number.\n\n2. **Verify the Pattern:**\n   - 20 is 2 times 10.\n   - 40 is 2 times 20.\n   - 80 is 2 times 40.\n   - 160 is 2 times 80.\n   - 320 is 2 times 160.\n\n3. **Apply the Pattern:**\n   - Since each number is double the previous one, the next number should be 2 times 320.\n\n4. **Calculate the Next Number:**\n   - 320 * 2 = 640.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The next number in the sequence is 640.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is <<<640>>>."
