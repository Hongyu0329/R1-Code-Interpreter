    "To analyze the sequence 8, 16, 32, 64, ?, we need to identify the pattern or rule that governs the progression of numbers. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   - Start by examining the relationship between consecutive numbers in the sequence.\n   - From 8 to 16: The number 16 is obtained by multiplying 8 by 2 (8 * 2 = 16).\n   - From 16 to 32: The number 32 is obtained by multiplying 16 by 2 (16 * 2 = 32).\n   - From 32 to 64: The number 64 is obtained by multiplying 32 by 2 (32 * 2 = 64).\n\n2. **Determine the Rule:**\n   - The pattern observed is that each number in the sequence is obtained by multiplying the previous number by 2.\n   - This is a geometric sequence where each term is twice the previous term.\n\n3. **Apply the Rule to Find the Next Term:**\n   - To find the next term in the sequence after 64, apply the same rule: multiply 64 by 2.\n   - Calculation: 64 * 2 = 128.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The next number in the sequence, represented by \"?\", is 128.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is enclosed within triple angle brackets as follows:\n\n<<<128>>>"
