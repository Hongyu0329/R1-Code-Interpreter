    "To solve the problem, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence: -10, -10, -20, -30, ?.\n\nLet's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Sequence Pattern:**\n   - Start with the first two numbers: -10, -10.\n   - The difference between the first and second number is 0 (-10 - (-10) = 0).\n   - The difference between the second and third number is -10 (-20 - (-10) = -10).\n   - The difference between the third and fourth number is -10 (-30 - (-20) = -10).\n\n2. **Determine the Pattern:**\n   - The differences between consecutive terms are: 0, -10, -10.\n   - It appears that after the initial repetition of -10, the sequence decreases by 10 for each subsequent term.\n\n3. **Predict the Next Term:**\n   - The last difference was -10 (from -20 to -30).\n   - If the pattern continues, the next difference should also be -10.\n   - Therefore, the next term should be -30 - 10 = -40.\n\n4. **Verify the Pattern:**\n   - Let's verify if the pattern holds:\n     - Start: -10\n     - Next: -10 (difference 0)\n     - Next: -20 (difference -10)\n     - Next: -30 (difference -10)\n     - Predicted Next: -40 (difference -10)\n\nThe pattern is consistent with the differences being 0, -10, -10, -10, and so on.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is -40.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<-40>>>."
