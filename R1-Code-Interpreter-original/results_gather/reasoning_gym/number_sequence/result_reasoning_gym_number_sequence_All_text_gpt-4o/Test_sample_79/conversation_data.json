    "To solve the problem, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence and determine the next number.\n\n1. **Examine the Sequence:**\n   The given sequence is: 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 192, ?\n\n2. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   - Look at the relationship between consecutive terms.\n   - From 3 to 6: 6 is 2 times 3.\n   - From 6 to 12: 12 is 2 times 6.\n   - From 12 to 24: 24 is 2 times 12.\n   - From 24 to 48: 48 is 2 times 24.\n   - From 48 to 96: 96 is 2 times 48.\n   - From 96 to 192: 192 is 2 times 96.\n\n3. **Determine the Rule:**\n   - Each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by 2.\n   - This is a geometric sequence where each term is double the previous term.\n\n4. **Calculate the Next Term:**\n   - The last known term is 192.\n   - To find the next term, multiply 192 by 2.\n   - 192 Ã— 2 = 384.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The next term in the sequence is 384.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is <<<384>>>."
