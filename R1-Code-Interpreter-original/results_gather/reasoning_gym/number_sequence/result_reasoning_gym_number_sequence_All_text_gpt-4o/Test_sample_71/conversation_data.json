    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence of numbers: -6, -30, -78, -174, and then determine the next number in the sequence.\n\nStep 1: Identify the differences between consecutive terms.\n- The difference between the first term (-6) and the second term (-30) is:\n  \\[\n  -30 - (-6) = -30 + 6 = -24\n  \\]\n\n- The difference between the second term (-30) and the third term (-78) is:\n  \\[\n  -78 - (-30) = -78 + 30 = -48\n  \\]\n\n- The difference between the third term (-78) and the fourth term (-174) is:\n  \\[\n  -174 - (-78) = -174 + 78 = -96\n  \\]\n\nStep 2: Analyze the pattern in the differences.\n- The differences are: -24, -48, -96.\n- Notice that each difference is double the previous difference:\n  \\[\n  -48 = 2 \\times (-24)\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  -96 = 2 \\times (-48)\n  \\]\n\nStep 3: Predict the next difference.\n- Following the pattern, the next difference should be double the last difference:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Next difference} = 2 \\times (-96) = -192\n  \\]\n\nStep 4: Calculate the next term in the sequence.\n- Add the next difference to the last term in the sequence (-174):\n  \\[\n  \\text{Next term} = -174 + (-192) = -174 - 192 = -366\n  \\]\n\nTherefore, the next number in the sequence is -366.\n\nThe value of \"?\" is enclosed within triple angle brackets as requested:\n<<<-366>>>"
