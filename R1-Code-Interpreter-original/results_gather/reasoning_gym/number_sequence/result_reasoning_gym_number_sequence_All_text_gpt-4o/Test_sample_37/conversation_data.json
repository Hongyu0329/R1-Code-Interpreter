    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence of numbers: 8, 8, 16, 24, 40, 64, 104, ?.\n\nLet's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the differences between consecutive terms:**\n   - 8 to 8: Difference = 0\n   - 8 to 16: Difference = 8\n   - 16 to 24: Difference = 8\n   - 24 to 40: Difference = 16\n   - 40 to 64: Difference = 24\n   - 64 to 104: Difference = 40\n\n2. **Examine the differences:**\n   - The differences are: 0, 8, 8, 16, 24, 40.\n   - Notice that starting from the second difference, the differences themselves form a sequence: 8, 8, 16, 24, 40.\n\n3. **Identify the pattern in the differences:**\n   - The differences are increasing in a specific pattern: 8, 8, 16, 24, 40.\n   - Let's look at the differences between these differences:\n     - 8 to 8: Difference = 0\n     - 8 to 16: Difference = 8\n     - 16 to 24: Difference = 8\n     - 24 to 40: Difference = 16\n\n4. **Examine the second-level differences:**\n   - The second-level differences are: 0, 8, 8, 16.\n   - This sequence suggests a pattern where the differences are increasing by 8 after the initial 0.\n\n5. **Predict the next difference:**\n   - Following the pattern of the second-level differences (0, 8, 8, 16), the next difference should be 24 (since 16 + 8 = 24).\n\n6. **Calculate the next term in the sequence:**\n   - The last term in the sequence is 104.\n   - The next difference, based on our pattern, is 24.\n   - Therefore, the next term is 104 + 24 = 128.\n\nThus, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is 128.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<128>>>."
