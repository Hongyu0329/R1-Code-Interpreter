    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence of numbers: 9, 9, 18, 27, 45, 72, 117, 189, ?.\n\nLet's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the sequence type**: \n   - The sequence starts with two identical numbers, 9 and 9. \n   - The subsequent numbers increase, suggesting a possible arithmetic or geometric progression, or a combination of operations.\n\n2. **Calculate the differences between consecutive terms**:\n   - 9 to 9: Difference = 0\n   - 9 to 18: Difference = 9\n   - 18 to 27: Difference = 9\n   - 27 to 45: Difference = 18\n   - 45 to 72: Difference = 27\n   - 72 to 117: Difference = 45\n   - 117 to 189: Difference = 72\n\n3. **Analyze the differences**:\n   - The differences themselves form a sequence: 0, 9, 9, 18, 27, 45, 72.\n   - Notice that starting from the third difference (9), the differences form a sequence: 9, 18, 27, 45, 72.\n   - This sequence of differences appears to be increasing in a specific pattern.\n\n4. **Identify the pattern in the differences**:\n   - The differences are: 9, 18, 27, 45, 72.\n   - These differences can be seen as a sequence where each term is the sum of the two preceding terms, starting from the third term:\n     - 9 (first term)\n     - 18 (second term)\n     - 27 = 9 + 18\n     - 45 = 18 + 27\n     - 72 = 27 + 45\n   - This suggests a Fibonacci-like pattern in the differences.\n\n5. **Predict the next difference**:\n   - Following the pattern, the next difference should be the sum of the last two differences:\n     - Next difference = 45 + 72 = 117\n\n6. **Calculate the next term in the sequence**:\n   - The last known term in the sequence is 189.\n   - Add the predicted difference to this term to find the next term:\n     - Next term = 189 + 117 = 306\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is 306.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<306>>>."
