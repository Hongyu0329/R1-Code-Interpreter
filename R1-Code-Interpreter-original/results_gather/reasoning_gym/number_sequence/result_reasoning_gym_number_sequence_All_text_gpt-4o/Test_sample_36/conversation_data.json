    "To determine the value of \"?\" in the sequence -5, -3, -2, -1, -1, -1, -1, ?, we need to analyze the pattern of the sequence step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the Sequence Pattern:**\n   - Start by examining the differences between consecutive terms:\n     - From -5 to -3: The difference is +2.\n     - From -3 to -2: The difference is +1.\n     - From -2 to -1: The difference is +1.\n     - From -1 to -1: The difference is 0.\n     - From -1 to -1: The difference is 0.\n     - From -1 to -1: The difference is 0.\n\n2. **Observe the Pattern:**\n   - The sequence starts with an increase of 2, followed by an increase of 1, and then another increase of 1.\n   - After reaching -1, the sequence stabilizes and remains constant at -1 for the next four terms.\n\n3. **Predict the Next Term:**\n   - Since the last four terms are all -1, and there is no indication of a change in the pattern, it is reasonable to predict that the next term will also be -1.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The sequence appears to have reached a stable state at -1, and the next term is expected to continue this pattern.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is -1.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<-1>>>."
