    "To solve the sequence problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that governs the progression of numbers. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Sequence**: The given sequence is 7, 7, 14, 21, 35, ?.\n\n2. **Look for Patterns**: \n   - The first two numbers are both 7.\n   - The third number is 14, which is double the first number (7 * 2 = 14).\n   - The fourth number is 21, which is the sum of the second and third numbers (7 + 14 = 21).\n   - The fifth number is 35, which is the sum of the third and fourth numbers (14 + 21 = 35).\n\n3. **Determine the Rule**:\n   - The sequence seems to follow a pattern where each number after the second is the sum of the two preceding numbers. This is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but it starts with two 7s instead of 0 and 1.\n\n4. **Apply the Rule to Find the Next Number**:\n   - To find the next number in the sequence, we add the last two numbers: 21 and 35.\n   - Calculation: 21 + 35 = 56.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The next number in the sequence is 56.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is <<<56>>>."
