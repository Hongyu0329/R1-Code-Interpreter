    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence of numbers: 10, 10, 20, 30, 50, ?.\n\nLet's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the differences between consecutive terms:**\n   - The difference between the first and second term (10 and 10) is 0.\n   - The difference between the second and third term (10 and 20) is 10.\n   - The difference between the third and fourth term (20 and 30) is 10.\n   - The difference between the fourth and fifth term (30 and 50) is 20.\n\n2. **Look for a pattern in the differences:**\n   - The differences are: 0, 10, 10, 20.\n   - Notice that the differences themselves seem to be increasing: 0, 10, 10, 20.\n\n3. **Predict the next difference:**\n   - If we assume the differences are increasing in a certain pattern, we can hypothesize that the next difference might be 20 (repeating the last difference) or it might increase further.\n\n4. **Check for a consistent pattern:**\n   - If we assume the differences are increasing by 10 every two steps (0, 10, 10, 20), the next logical difference could be 20 again, following the pattern of repeating the last difference before increasing.\n\n5. **Calculate the next term:**\n   - The last term given is 50. If we add the next difference (20) to 50, we get 70.\n\nTherefore, the next term in the sequence is 70.\n\nThe value of \"?\" is enclosed within triple angle brackets as requested:\n\n<<<70>>>"
