    "To analyze the sequence and determine the value of \"?\", we need to identify any patterns or rules that govern the progression of numbers. Let's examine the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Sequence Given**: 10, 10, 20, 30, 50, ?\n\n2. **Identify Differences**:\n   - The difference between the first and second term (10 and 10) is 0.\n   - The difference between the second and third term (10 and 20) is 10.\n   - The difference between the third and fourth term (20 and 30) is 10.\n   - The difference between the fourth and fifth term (30 and 50) is 20.\n\n3. **Pattern Recognition**:\n   - The differences between consecutive terms are: 0, 10, 10, 20.\n   - It appears that the differences are increasing in a specific pattern: 0, 10, 10, 20.\n\n4. **Predict the Next Difference**:\n   - If we follow the pattern of differences, the next difference should be 20 (since the pattern seems to be increasing by 10 after every two terms: 0, 10, 10, 20, 20).\n\n5. **Calculate the Next Term**:\n   - The last known term in the sequence is 50.\n   - Add the predicted difference (20) to the last term: 50 + 20 = 70.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The next term in the sequence, represented by \"?\", is 70.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is:\n\n<<<70>>>"
