    "To solve the sequence 7, 15, 30, 53, ?, we need to identify the pattern or rule that governs the progression of numbers. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the differences between consecutive terms:**\n   - The difference between the second term (15) and the first term (7) is: \n     \\[\n     15 - 7 = 8\n     \\]\n   - The difference between the third term (30) and the second term (15) is:\n     \\[\n     30 - 15 = 15\n     \\]\n   - The difference between the fourth term (53) and the third term (30) is:\n     \\[\n     53 - 30 = 23\n     \\]\n\n2. **Analyze the differences:**\n   - The differences between consecutive terms are 8, 15, and 23.\n   - Let's find the differences between these differences:\n     - The difference between 15 and 8 is:\n       \\[\n       15 - 8 = 7\n       \\]\n     - The difference between 23 and 15 is:\n       \\[\n       23 - 15 = 8\n       \\]\n\n3. **Identify the pattern in the differences:**\n   - The second-level differences are 7 and 8, which suggests a pattern. \n   - If we assume the next second-level difference follows the pattern, it should be 9 (since 7, 8, 9 is a simple arithmetic progression).\n\n4. **Calculate the next first-level difference:**\n   - If the next second-level difference is 9, then the next first-level difference (after 23) should be:\n     \\[\n     23 + 9 = 32\n     \\]\n\n5. **Determine the next term in the sequence:**\n   - Add the next first-level difference (32) to the last known term (53) to find the next term:\n     \\[\n     53 + 32 = 85\n     \\]\n\nThus, the next term in the sequence is 85.\n\nThe value of \"?\" is enclosed within triple angle brackets as requested:\n\n<<<85>>>"
