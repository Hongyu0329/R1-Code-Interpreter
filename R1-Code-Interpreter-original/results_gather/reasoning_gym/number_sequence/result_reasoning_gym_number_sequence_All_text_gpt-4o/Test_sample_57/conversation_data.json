    "To solve the sequence problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that governs the progression of numbers. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Sequence:**\n   The given sequence is: 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, ?\n\n2. **Look for Patterns:**\n   - Check if the sequence is arithmetic (constant difference between terms):\n     - Difference between 16 and 8 is 8.\n     - Difference between 32 and 16 is 16.\n     - Difference between 64 and 32 is 32.\n     - Difference between 128 and 64 is 64.\n   - The differences are not constant, so it is not an arithmetic sequence.\n\n3. **Check for Geometric Sequence:**\n   - A geometric sequence has a constant ratio between consecutive terms.\n   - Calculate the ratio between consecutive terms:\n     - Ratio of 16 to 8 is 16/8 = 2.\n     - Ratio of 32 to 16 is 32/16 = 2.\n     - Ratio of 64 to 32 is 64/32 = 2.\n     - Ratio of 128 to 64 is 128/64 = 2.\n   - The ratio is constant (2), indicating a geometric sequence.\n\n4. **Determine the Next Term:**\n   - Since the sequence is geometric with a common ratio of 2, multiply the last term by the common ratio to find the next term.\n   - Last term is 128.\n   - Next term = 128 * 2 = 256.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The sequence follows a geometric progression with a common ratio of 2.\n   - The next term in the sequence is 256.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is <<<256>>>."
