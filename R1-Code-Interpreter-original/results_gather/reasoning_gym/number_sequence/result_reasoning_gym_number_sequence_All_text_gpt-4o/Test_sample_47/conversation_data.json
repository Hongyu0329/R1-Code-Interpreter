    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence of numbers: -8, -8, -16, -24, -40, -64, -104, -168, ?.\n\nLet's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the differences between consecutive terms:**\n   - The difference between the 1st and 2nd term: -8 - (-8) = 0\n   - The difference between the 2nd and 3rd term: -16 - (-8) = -8\n   - The difference between the 3rd and 4th term: -24 - (-16) = -8\n   - The difference between the 4th and 5th term: -40 - (-24) = -16\n   - The difference between the 5th and 6th term: -64 - (-40) = -24\n   - The difference between the 6th and 7th term: -104 - (-64) = -40\n   - The difference between the 7th and 8th term: -168 - (-104) = -64\n\n2. **Observe the pattern in the differences:**\n   - The differences are: 0, -8, -8, -16, -24, -40, -64\n   - Notice that starting from the 3rd difference, each difference is the sum of the two preceding differences:\n     - -8 = 0 + (-8)\n     - -16 = -8 + (-8)\n     - -24 = -8 + (-16)\n     - -40 = -16 + (-24)\n     - -64 = -24 + (-40)\n\n3. **Predict the next difference:**\n   - Following the pattern, the next difference should be the sum of the last two differences:\n     - Next difference = -40 + (-64) = -104\n\n4. **Calculate the next term in the sequence:**\n   - The last known term is -168. To find the next term, add the predicted difference to this term:\n     - Next term = -168 + (-104) = -272\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is -272.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<-272>>>."
