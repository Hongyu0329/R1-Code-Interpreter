    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence and determine the next number.\n\n1. **Examine the Sequence:**\n   The given sequence is: 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 192, 384, ?\n\n2. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   Let's look at the relationship between consecutive terms:\n   - 6 is 2 times 3\n   - 12 is 2 times 6\n   - 24 is 2 times 12\n   - 48 is 2 times 24\n   - 96 is 2 times 48\n   - 192 is 2 times 96\n   - 384 is 2 times 192\n\n   From this, we can see that each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by 2.\n\n3. **Apply the Pattern:**\n   To find the next term in the sequence, we multiply the last known term (384) by 2:\n   - 384 * 2 = 768\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   The next number in the sequence is 768.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is:\n\n<<<768>>>"
