    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the given sequence and use it to find the next number. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Sequence**: The sequence given is: -1, -1, -2, -3, -5, -8, -13, -21, ?\n\n2. **Look for Patterns**: \n   - The sequence resembles the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. However, the numbers are negative.\n   - In a typical Fibonacci sequence, the pattern is: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...\n   - Here, the sequence starts with -1, -1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding numbers, but with negative values.\n\n3. **Verify the Pattern**:\n   - Start with the first two numbers: -1, -1\n   - The third number is: -1 + (-1) = -2\n   - The fourth number is: -1 + (-2) = -3\n   - The fifth number is: -2 + (-3) = -5\n   - The sixth number is: -3 + (-5) = -8\n   - The seventh number is: -5 + (-8) = -13\n   - The eighth number is: -8 + (-13) = -21\n\n4. **Calculate the Next Number**:\n   - Following the pattern, the next number should be the sum of the last two numbers in the sequence.\n   - The last two numbers are -13 and -21.\n   - Calculate the next number: -13 + (-21) = -34\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The pattern is consistent with a negative Fibonacci sequence.\n   - The next number in the sequence is -34.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is <<<-34>>>."
