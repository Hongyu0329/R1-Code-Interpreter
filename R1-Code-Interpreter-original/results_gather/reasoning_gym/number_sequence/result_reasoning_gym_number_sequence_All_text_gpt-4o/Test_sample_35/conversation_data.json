    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence and determine the next number.\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   - Look at the sequence: -9, -14, -19, -24, -29, -34.\n   - Calculate the difference between consecutive terms:\n     - -14 - (-9) = -5\n     - -19 - (-14) = -5\n     - -24 - (-19) = -5\n     - -29 - (-24) = -5\n     - -34 - (-29) = -5\n\n2. **Determine the Pattern:**\n   - The difference between each consecutive term is constant and equal to -5.\n   - This indicates that the sequence is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of -5.\n\n3. **Find the Next Term:**\n   - To find the next term in the sequence, subtract 5 from the last term (-34):\n     - Next term = -34 - 5 = -39\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The next term in the sequence is -39.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is <<<-39>>>."
