    "To solve the problem, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence: -2, -2, -4, -6, ?.\n\nStep 1: Examine the sequence.\n- The sequence starts with -2, -2, -4, -6.\n\nStep 2: Look for a pattern in the differences between consecutive terms.\n- The difference between the first and second term (-2 and -2) is 0.\n- The difference between the second and third term (-2 and -4) is -2.\n- The difference between the third and fourth term (-4 and -6) is -2.\n\nStep 3: Identify the pattern in the differences.\n- The differences are 0, -2, -2. \n\nStep 4: Predict the next difference.\n- The pattern in the differences seems to be: 0, -2, -2. \n- If we assume the pattern continues, the next difference should be -2.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the next term in the sequence.\n- The last term in the sequence is -6.\n- If the next difference is -2, then the next term is -6 + (-2) = -8.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is -8.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<-8>>>."
