    "To solve the sequence problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that governs the progression of numbers. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Sequence:**\n   The given sequence is: -8, -16, -32, -64, ?\n\n2. **Look for a Pattern:**\n   - Start by examining the relationship between consecutive terms.\n   - Calculate the ratio of each term to the previous term:\n     - \\(-16 / -8 = 2\\)\n     - \\(-32 / -16 = 2\\)\n     - \\(-64 / -32 = 2\\)\n\n3. **Determine the Rule:**\n   - The sequence is a geometric progression where each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by 2.\n   - The common ratio (r) is 2.\n\n4. **Apply the Rule to Find the Next Term:**\n   - The last known term is -64.\n   - Multiply -64 by the common ratio (2) to find the next term:\n     - \\(-64 \\times 2 = -128\\)\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The next term in the sequence is -128.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is:\n\n<<<-128>>>"
