    "To solve the sequence problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that governs the progression of numbers. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Sequence:**\n   The given sequence is: 9, 18, 36, 72, 144, ?\n\n2. **Look for Patterns:**\n   - Check if the sequence is arithmetic (constant difference between terms):\n     - 18 - 9 = 9\n     - 36 - 18 = 18\n     - 72 - 36 = 36\n     - 144 - 72 = 72\n     The differences are not constant, so it's not an arithmetic sequence.\n\n   - Check if the sequence is geometric (constant ratio between terms):\n     - 18 / 9 = 2\n     - 36 / 18 = 2\n     - 72 / 36 = 2\n     - 144 / 72 = 2\n     The ratios are constant, indicating a geometric sequence.\n\n3. **Determine the Rule:**\n   Since the sequence is geometric with a common ratio of 2, each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by 2.\n\n4. **Apply the Rule to Find the Next Term:**\n   - The last known term is 144.\n   - Multiply 144 by the common ratio (2) to find the next term:\n     - 144 * 2 = 288\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   The next term in the sequence is 288.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is <<<288>>>."
