    "To determine the value of \"?\" in the sequence -10, -5, -3, -2, -1, -1, ?, we need to analyze the pattern or rule governing the sequence. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Sequence Type**: \n   - The sequence is a list of numbers that appear to be increasing. We need to determine if there is a consistent pattern or rule.\n\n2. **Calculate Differences**:\n   - Calculate the differences between consecutive terms to see if there is a pattern:\n     - From -10 to -5: Difference is -5 - (-10) = 5\n     - From -5 to -3: Difference is -3 - (-5) = 2\n     - From -3 to -2: Difference is -2 - (-3) = 1\n     - From -2 to -1: Difference is -1 - (-2) = 1\n     - From -1 to -1: Difference is -1 - (-1) = 0\n\n3. **Analyze the Differences**:\n   - The differences are: 5, 2, 1, 1, 0.\n   - The differences are decreasing: 5, 2, 1, 1, 0. This suggests a pattern where the differences decrease by 3, then 1, then 0, and then remain constant.\n\n4. **Predict the Next Difference**:\n   - If the pattern of differences continues, the next difference should be 0 (since the last difference was 0).\n\n5. **Calculate the Next Term**:\n   - Since the last term is -1 and the next difference is 0, the next term should be -1 + 0 = -1.\n\n6. **Verify the Pattern**:\n   - The sequence of differences: 5, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, confirms the pattern of decreasing differences, which supports our prediction.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is -1.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<-1>>>."
