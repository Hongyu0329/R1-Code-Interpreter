    "To analyze the sequence 8, 5, 3, 2, 2, ?, we need to identify a pattern or rule that governs the progression of numbers. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the differences between consecutive terms:**\n   - The difference between the first term (8) and the second term (5) is 8 - 5 = 3.\n   - The difference between the second term (5) and the third term (3) is 5 - 3 = 2.\n   - The difference between the third term (3) and the fourth term (2) is 3 - 2 = 1.\n   - The difference between the fourth term (2) and the fifth term (2) is 2 - 2 = 0.\n\n2. **Observe the pattern in the differences:**\n   - The differences are 3, 2, 1, 0. This sequence of differences is decreasing by 1 each time.\n\n3. **Predict the next difference:**\n   - Following the pattern of decreasing by 1, the next difference should be -1.\n\n4. **Calculate the next term using the predicted difference:**\n   - The last known term is 2. If the next difference is -1, then the next term should be 2 - 1 = 1.\n\n5. **Verify the pattern:**\n   - The sequence of differences (3, 2, 1, 0, -1) confirms a consistent pattern of decreasing by 1, which supports our calculation.\n\nBased on this analysis, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is 1.\n\nTherefore, the answer is <<<1>>>."
