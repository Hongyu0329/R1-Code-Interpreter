    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence: -2, 4, -10, 24, -58, 140, and determine the next number.\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   - The sequence alternates between negative and positive numbers.\n   - Let's examine the differences between consecutive terms to see if there's a pattern.\n\n2. **Calculate Differences:**\n   - Difference between 4 and -2: \\(4 - (-2) = 6\\)\n   - Difference between -10 and 4: \\(-10 - 4 = -14\\)\n   - Difference between 24 and -10: \\(24 - (-10) = 34\\)\n   - Difference between -58 and 24: \\(-58 - 24 = -82\\)\n   - Difference between 140 and -58: \\(140 - (-58) = 198\\)\n\n3. **Analyze the Differences:**\n   - The differences are: 6, -14, 34, -82, 198.\n   - Let's examine the pattern in these differences.\n\n4. **Calculate Second Differences:**\n   - Difference between -14 and 6: \\(-14 - 6 = -20\\)\n   - Difference between 34 and -14: \\(34 - (-14) = 48\\)\n   - Difference between -82 and 34: \\(-82 - 34 = -116\\)\n   - Difference between 198 and -82: \\(198 - (-82) = 280\\)\n\n5. **Analyze the Second Differences:**\n   - The second differences are: -20, 48, -116, 280.\n   - Let's calculate the third differences to see if there's a pattern.\n\n6. **Calculate Third Differences:**\n   - Difference between 48 and -20: \\(48 - (-20) = 68\\)\n   - Difference between -116 and 48: \\(-116 - 48 = -164\\)\n   - Difference between 280 and -116: \\(280 - (-116) = 396\\)\n\n7. **Analyze the Third Differences:**\n   - The third differences are: 68, -164, 396.\n   - Let's calculate the fourth differences to see if there's a pattern.\n\n8. **Calculate Fourth Differences:**\n   - Difference between -164 and 68: \\(-164 - 68 = -232\\)\n   - Difference between 396 and -164: \\(396 - (-164) = 560\\)\n\n9. **Analyze the Fourth Differences:**\n   - The fourth differences are: -232, 560.\n   - Let's calculate the fifth difference to see if there's a pattern.\n\n10. **Calculate Fifth Difference:**\n    - Difference between 560 and -232: \\(560 - (-232) = 792\\)\n\n11. **Conclusion:**\n    - The differences are increasing in a pattern that suggests a polynomial relationship.\n    - The sequence of differences suggests a cubic polynomial relationship.\n    - Using the pattern of differences, we can predict the next difference after 198, which is 198 + 280 = 478.\n\n12. **Calculate the Next Term:**\n    - The next term in the sequence is 140 + 478 = 618.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is:\n\n<<<618>>>"
