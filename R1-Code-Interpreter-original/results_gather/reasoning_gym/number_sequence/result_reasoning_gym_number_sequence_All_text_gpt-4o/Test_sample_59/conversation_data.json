    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence and determine the next number. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Sequence:**\n   The given sequence is: -4, -4, -8, -12, -20, -32, -52, ?\n\n2. **Calculate the Differences:**\n   Let's find the differences between consecutive terms to see if there's a pattern:\n   - Difference between -4 and -4: 0\n   - Difference between -4 and -8: -4\n   - Difference between -8 and -12: -4\n   - Difference between -12 and -20: -8\n   - Difference between -20 and -32: -12\n   - Difference between -32 and -52: -20\n\n   The differences are: 0, -4, -4, -8, -12, -20\n\n3. **Analyze the Differences:**\n   Let's look at the differences between these differences:\n   - Difference between 0 and -4: -4\n   - Difference between -4 and -4: 0\n   - Difference between -4 and -8: -4\n   - Difference between -8 and -12: -4\n   - Difference between -12 and -20: -8\n\n   The second-level differences are: -4, 0, -4, -4, -8\n\n4. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   The second-level differences suggest a pattern. Let's look at the differences between these second-level differences:\n   - Difference between -4 and 0: 4\n   - Difference between 0 and -4: -4\n   - Difference between -4 and -4: 0\n   - Difference between -4 and -8: -4\n\n   The third-level differences are: 4, -4, 0, -4\n\n5. **Predict the Next Difference:**\n   The third-level differences don't show a clear pattern, but the second-level differences suggest a pattern of decreasing by 4. Let's assume the next second-level difference follows this pattern:\n   - The next second-level difference after -8 would be -12 (decreasing by 4).\n\n6. **Calculate the Next First-Level Difference:**\n   The last first-level difference was -20. If the next second-level difference is -12, then:\n   - Next first-level difference = -20 + (-12) = -32\n\n7. **Calculate the Next Term in the Sequence:**\n   The last term in the sequence is -52. Using the next first-level difference:\n   - Next term = -52 + (-32) = -84\n\nTherefore, the next term in the sequence is -84.\n\nThe value of \"?\" is <<<-84>>>."
