    "To solve the problem, we need to identify the pattern in the given sequence and determine the next number.\n\n1. **Identify the Sequence Pattern:**\n   - The sequence provided is: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, ?\n   - We need to determine the rule or pattern that generates this sequence.\n\n2. **Examine the Differences Between Consecutive Terms:**\n   - Calculate the difference between each pair of consecutive terms:\n     - 2 - 0 = 2\n     - 4 - 2 = 2\n     - 6 - 4 = 2\n     - 8 - 6 = 2\n   - The difference between each consecutive term is consistently 2.\n\n3. **Determine the Pattern:**\n   - The sequence is an arithmetic sequence where each term increases by 2 from the previous term.\n\n4. **Predict the Next Term:**\n   - To find the next term in the sequence, add the common difference (2) to the last known term (8):\n     - Next term = 8 + 2 = 10\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The next term in the sequence is 10.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is <<<10>>>."
