    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence of numbers: 10, 2, -6, -14, -22, -30, and determine the next number in the sequence.\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   - First, we calculate the differences between consecutive terms to see if there is a consistent pattern.\n   - Difference between 10 and 2: \\(2 - 10 = -8\\)\n   - Difference between 2 and -6: \\(-6 - 2 = -8\\)\n   - Difference between -6 and -14: \\(-14 - (-6) = -8\\)\n   - Difference between -14 and -22: \\(-22 - (-14) = -8\\)\n   - Difference between -22 and -30: \\(-30 - (-22) = -8\\)\n\n2. **Recognize the Pattern:**\n   - The differences between consecutive terms are consistent and equal to -8. This indicates that the sequence is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of -8.\n\n3. **Determine the Next Term:**\n   - To find the next term in the sequence, we subtract 8 from the last known term, which is -30.\n   - Next term: \\(-30 - 8 = -38\\)\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The sequence follows a simple arithmetic pattern where each term is 8 less than the previous term.\n\nTherefore, the next number in the sequence is -38.\n\nThe value of \"?\" is enclosed within triple angle brackets as requested:\n\n<<<-38>>>"
