    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence and determine the next number. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Sequence**: The given sequence is: -1, -1, -2, -3, -5, -8, -13, ?\n\n2. **Look for Patterns**: \n   - The sequence resembles the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. However, in this case, the numbers are negative.\n   - Let's verify if this is a negative Fibonacci sequence:\n     - The first two numbers are -1 and -1.\n     - The third number is -2, which is the sum of the first two numbers: -1 + (-1) = -2.\n     - The fourth number is -3, which is the sum of the second and third numbers: -1 + (-2) = -3.\n     - The fifth number is -5, which is the sum of the third and fourth numbers: -2 + (-3) = -5.\n     - The sixth number is -8, which is the sum of the fourth and fifth numbers: -3 + (-5) = -8.\n     - The seventh number is -13, which is the sum of the fifth and sixth numbers: -5 + (-8) = -13.\n\n3. **Determine the Next Number**:\n   - To find the next number in the sequence, we add the sixth and seventh numbers:\n     - Sixth number: -8\n     - Seventh number: -13\n     - Next number: -8 + (-13) = -21\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The sequence follows a pattern similar to the Fibonacci sequence but with negative numbers. Each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.\n\nTherefore, the next number in the sequence is -21.\n\nThe value of \"?\" is <<<-21>>>."
