    "To solve the sequence problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that governs the progression of numbers. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Sequence**: The given sequence is -3, -3, -6, -9, -15, ?.\n\n2. **Calculate Differences**: Start by calculating the differences between consecutive terms to see if there's a consistent pattern:\n   - Difference between the 1st and 2nd term: -3 - (-3) = 0\n   - Difference between the 2nd and 3rd term: -6 - (-3) = -3\n   - Difference between the 3rd and 4th term: -9 - (-6) = -3\n   - Difference between the 4th and 5th term: -15 - (-9) = -6\n\n3. **Analyze the Differences**: The differences are 0, -3, -3, and -6. Let's see if there's a pattern in these differences:\n   - The first difference is 0.\n   - The second and third differences are both -3.\n   - The fourth difference is -6.\n\n4. **Look for a Pattern**: The differences themselves seem to follow a pattern:\n   - The first difference is 0.\n   - The second and third differences are -3.\n   - The fourth difference is -6.\n\n   It appears that the differences are increasing by -3 after the initial 0. Let's assume the next difference follows this pattern.\n\n5. **Predict the Next Difference**: If the pattern continues, the next difference should be -6 - 3 = -9.\n\n6. **Calculate the Next Term**: Use the predicted difference to find the next term in the sequence:\n   - The last known term is -15.\n   - Add the predicted difference to this term: -15 + (-9) = -24.\n\nTherefore, the next term in the sequence is -24.\n\nThe value of \"?\" is <<<-24>>>."
