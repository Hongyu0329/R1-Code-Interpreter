    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the given sequence and predict the next number.\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   - The sequence provided is: -10, 10, -10, 10, -10, 10, -10, ?\n   - Observe the alternating pattern: the sequence alternates between -10 and 10.\n\n2. **Determine the Next Number:**\n   - The sequence starts with -10 and alternates with 10.\n   - The positions in the sequence are as follows:\n     - Position 1: -10\n     - Position 2: 10\n     - Position 3: -10\n     - Position 4: 10\n     - Position 5: -10\n     - Position 6: 10\n     - Position 7: -10\n     - Position 8: ?\n   - Notice that odd positions (1, 3, 5, 7) have the value -10, and even positions (2, 4, 6) have the value 10.\n\n3. **Predict the Next Number:**\n   - The position of the unknown value is 8, which is an even position.\n   - Based on the pattern, even positions have the value 10.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" in the sequence is 10.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<10>>>."
