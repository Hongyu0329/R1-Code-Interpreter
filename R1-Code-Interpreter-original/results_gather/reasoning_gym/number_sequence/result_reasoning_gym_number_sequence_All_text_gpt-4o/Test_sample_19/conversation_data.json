    "To solve the problem, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence and determine the next number. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Sequence:**\n   The given sequence is: 7, 14, 28, 56, 112, ?\n\n2. **Look for Patterns:**\n   - Check if the sequence is arithmetic (constant difference between terms):\n     - 14 - 7 = 7\n     - 28 - 14 = 14\n     - 56 - 28 = 28\n     - 112 - 56 = 56\n   The differences are not constant, so it's not an arithmetic sequence.\n\n   - Check if the sequence is geometric (constant ratio between terms):\n     - 14 / 7 = 2\n     - 28 / 14 = 2\n     - 56 / 28 = 2\n     - 112 / 56 = 2\n   The ratios are constant, indicating a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 2.\n\n3. **Determine the Next Term:**\n   Since the sequence is geometric with a common ratio of 2, we can find the next term by multiplying the last known term by the common ratio:\n   - Last known term: 112\n   - Common ratio: 2\n   - Next term: 112 * 2 = 224\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   The next term in the sequence is 224.\n\nTherefore, the value of \"?\" is <<<224>>>."
