    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence of numbers: -6, -14, -28, -50, -86, and then determine the next number in the sequence.\n\n1. **Identify the differences between consecutive terms:**\n   - The difference between the first and second terms: \\(-14 - (-6) = -14 + 6 = -8\\)\n   - The difference between the second and third terms: \\(-28 - (-14) = -28 + 14 = -14\\)\n   - The difference between the third and fourth terms: \\(-50 - (-28) = -50 + 28 = -22\\)\n   - The difference between the fourth and fifth terms: \\(-86 - (-50) = -86 + 50 = -36\\)\n\n2. **Analyze the differences:**\n   - The differences are: -8, -14, -22, -36.\n   - Let's find the differences between these differences to see if there's a second-level pattern:\n     - The difference between the first and second differences: \\(-14 - (-8) = -14 + 8 = -6\\)\n     - The difference between the second and third differences: \\(-22 - (-14) = -22 + 14 = -8\\)\n     - The difference between the third and fourth differences: \\(-36 - (-22) = -36 + 22 = -14\\)\n\n3. **Identify the pattern in the second-level differences:**\n   - The second-level differences are: -6, -8, -14.\n   - These differences do not form a simple arithmetic or geometric sequence, but they suggest a pattern of increasing negative differences.\n\n4. **Predict the next difference:**\n   - If we assume the pattern of second-level differences continues, the next second-level difference might be calculated by observing the increase in the differences:\n     - The increase from -6 to -8 is -2.\n     - The increase from -8 to -14 is -6.\n     - If we assume a pattern, the next increase might be -8 (following a pattern of -2, -6, -8).\n     - Therefore, the next second-level difference could be \\(-14 - 8 = -22\\).\n\n5. **Calculate the next first-level difference:**\n   - The last first-level difference was -36.\n   - If the next second-level difference is -22, then the next first-level difference is:\n     \\(-36 - 22 = -58\\).\n\n6. **Determine the next term in the sequence:**\n   - The last term in the sequence is -86.\n   - Adding the next first-level difference to this term gives:\n     \\(-86 - 58 = -144\\).\n\nTherefore, the next number in the sequence is -144.\n\nThe value of \"?\" is enclosed within triple angle brackets: <<<-144>>>."
