    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence of numbers: -2, -6, -12, -22, -38, -64, -106, -174, ?.\n\nLet's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the differences between consecutive terms:**\n   - Difference between -6 and -2: -6 - (-2) = -4\n   - Difference between -12 and -6: -12 - (-6) = -6\n   - Difference between -22 and -12: -22 - (-12) = -10\n   - Difference between -38 and -22: -38 - (-22) = -16\n   - Difference between -64 and -38: -64 - (-38) = -26\n   - Difference between -106 and -64: -106 - (-64) = -42\n   - Difference between -174 and -106: -174 - (-106) = -68\n\n2. **Analyze the differences:**\n   The differences are: -4, -6, -10, -16, -26, -42, -68.\n\n3. **Identify the pattern in the differences:**\n   Let's find the differences between these differences:\n   - Difference between -6 and -4: -6 - (-4) = -2\n   - Difference between -10 and -6: -10 - (-6) = -4\n   - Difference between -16 and -10: -16 - (-10) = -6\n   - Difference between -26 and -16: -26 - (-16) = -10\n   - Difference between -42 and -26: -42 - (-26) = -16\n   - Difference between -68 and -42: -68 - (-42) = -26\n\n   The second-level differences are: -2, -4, -6, -10, -16, -26.\n\n4. **Identify the pattern in the second-level differences:**\n   The second-level differences are increasing in a pattern similar to the original sequence of differences. Let's find the differences between these second-level differences:\n   - Difference between -4 and -2: -4 - (-2) = -2\n   - Difference between -6 and -4: -6 - (-4) = -2\n   - Difference between -10 and -6: -10 - (-6) = -4\n   - Difference between -16 and -10: -16 - (-10) = -6\n   - Difference between -26 and -16: -26 - (-16) = -10\n\n   The third-level differences are: -2, -2, -4, -6, -10.\n\n5. **Identify the pattern in the third-level differences:**\n   The third-level differences are: -2, -2, -4, -6, -10. This sequence is increasing by the differences: 0, -2, -2, -4.\n\n6. **Predict the next third-level difference:**\n   Following the pattern, the next third-level difference should be -16 (since the differences are increasing by -2, -2, -4, -6, -10, the next would be -16).\n\n7. **Calculate the next second-level difference:**\n   The last second-level difference was -26. Adding the predicted third-level difference of -16 gives us:\n   -26 + (-16) = -42.\n\n8. **Calculate the next first-level difference:**\n   The last first-level difference was -68. Adding the predicted second-level difference of -42 gives us:\n   -68 + (-42) = -110.\n\n9. **Calculate the next term in the sequence:**\n   The last term in the sequence was -174. Adding the predicted first-level difference of -110 gives us:\n   -174 + (-110) = -284.\n\nTherefore, the next term in the sequence is -284.\n\nThe value of \"?\" is <<<-284>>>."
