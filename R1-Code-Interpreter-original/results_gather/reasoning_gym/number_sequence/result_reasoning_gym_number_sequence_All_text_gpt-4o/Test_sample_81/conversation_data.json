    "To solve the sequence problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that governs the progression of numbers. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Sequence**: The given sequence is 3, 8, 16, 29, 50, ?.\n\n2. **Calculate the Differences**: Start by calculating the differences between consecutive terms to see if there's a pattern:\n   - Difference between 8 and 3: \\(8 - 3 = 5\\)\n   - Difference between 16 and 8: \\(16 - 8 = 8\\)\n   - Difference between 29 and 16: \\(29 - 16 = 13\\)\n   - Difference between 50 and 29: \\(50 - 29 = 21\\)\n\n3. **Analyze the Differences**: The differences are 5, 8, 13, and 21. Let's see if there's a pattern in these differences:\n   - Difference between 8 and 5: \\(8 - 5 = 3\\)\n   - Difference between 13 and 8: \\(13 - 8 = 5\\)\n   - Difference between 21 and 13: \\(21 - 13 = 8\\)\n\n4. **Identify the Pattern in Differences**: The second set of differences (3, 5, 8) suggests a pattern. These numbers are part of the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.\n\n5. **Extend the Pattern**: The next number in the Fibonacci-like sequence of differences (3, 5, 8) would be \\(5 + 8 = 13\\).\n\n6. **Calculate the Next Difference**: Add this next difference to the last number in the original sequence:\n   - Next difference: 13\n   - Last number in the sequence: 50\n   - Next number in the sequence: \\(50 + 13 = 63\\)\n\n7. **Verify the Pattern**: To ensure the pattern holds, let's verify:\n   - The differences between the original sequence terms are 5, 8, 13, 21.\n   - The differences between these differences are 3, 5, 8, and the next is 13, which fits the Fibonacci-like pattern.\n\nThus, the next number in the sequence is 63.\n\nThe value of \"?\" is enclosed within triple angle brackets as requested:\n\n<<<63>>>"
