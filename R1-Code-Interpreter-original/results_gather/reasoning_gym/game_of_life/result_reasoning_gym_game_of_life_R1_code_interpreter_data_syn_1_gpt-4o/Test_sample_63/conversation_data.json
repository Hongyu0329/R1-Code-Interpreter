    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate one step of Conway's Game of Life on the given grid. The rules of the Game of Life are as follows:\n\n1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.\n2. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.\n3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.\n\nThe grid has a wrapping topology, meaning the edges are connected to form a torus. This means that the neighbors of a cell on the edge of the grid include cells from the opposite edge.\n\nLet's write a Python script to simulate one step of the Game of Life on the given grid.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef count_neighbors(grid, x, y):\n    # Get the size of the grid\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    # Calculate the sum of the 3x3 block centered on (x, y)\n    # Use modulo to wrap around the edges\n    return sum(grid[(x + i) % rows, (y + j) % cols] for i in range(-1, 2) for j in range(-1, 2)) - grid[x, y]\n\ndef game_of_life_step(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to store the next state\n    new_grid = np.copy(grid)\n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for x in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for y in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            # Count the live neighbors\n            live_neighbors = count_neighbors(grid, x, y)\n            # Apply the Game of Life rules\n            if grid[x, y] == 1:\n                if live_neighbors < 2 or live_neighbors > 3:\n                    new_grid[x, y] = 0\n            else:\n                if live_neighbors == 3:\n                    new_grid[x, y] = 1\n    return new_grid\n\n# Initial grid\ninitial_grid = np.array([\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1],\n    [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n])\n\n# Simulate one step\nnext_grid = game_of_life_step(initial_grid)\n\n# Convert the result to a list of lists and print it\nprint(next_grid.tolist())\n```\n\nThis code will simulate one step of the Game of Life on the given grid and print the resulting grid. Let's execute it to get the result.",
