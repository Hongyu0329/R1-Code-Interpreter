    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate one step of Conway's Game of Life on the given grid. The rules for the Game of Life are as follows:\n\n1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.\n2. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.\n3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.\n\nThe grid has a wrapping topology, meaning the edges are connected to form a torus. This means that the neighbors of a cell include cells from the opposite edges.\n\nLet's write a Python script to simulate one step of the Game of Life on the given grid.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_neighbors(grid, x, y):\n    neighbors = [\n        ((x - 1) % grid.shape[0], (y - 1) % grid.shape[1]),\n        ((x - 1) % grid.shape[0], y),\n        ((x - 1) % grid.shape[0], (y + 1) % grid.shape[1]),\n        (x, (y - 1) % grid.shape[1]),\n        (x, (y + 1) % grid.shape[1]),\n        ((x + 1) % grid.shape[0], (y - 1) % grid.shape[1]),\n        ((x + 1) % grid.shape[0], y),\n        ((x + 1) % grid.shape[0], (y + 1) % grid.shape[1])\n    ]\n    return neighbors\n\ndef game_of_life_step(grid):\n    new_grid = np.copy(grid)\n    for x in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for y in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            live_neighbors = sum(grid[nx, ny] for nx, ny in get_neighbors(grid, x, y))\n            if grid[x, y] == 1:\n                if live_neighbors < 2 or live_neighbors > 3:\n                    new_grid[x, y] = 0\n            else:\n                if live_neighbors == 3:\n                    new_grid[x, y] = 1\n    return new_grid\n\ninitial_grid = np.array([\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0],\n    [0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]\n])\n\nnext_grid = game_of_life_step(initial_grid)\nprint(next_grid.tolist())\n```\n\nThis code will simulate one step of the Game of Life on the given grid and print the resulting grid in JSON format.
