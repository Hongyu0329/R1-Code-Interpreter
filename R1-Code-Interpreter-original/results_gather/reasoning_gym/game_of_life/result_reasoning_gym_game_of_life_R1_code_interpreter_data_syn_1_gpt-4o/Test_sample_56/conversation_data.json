    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate one step of Conway's Game of Life on the given grid. The rules of the Game of Life are as follows:\n\n1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.\n2. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.\n3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.\n\nThe grid has a wrapping topology, meaning the edges are connected to form a torus. This means that the neighbors of a cell on the edge of the grid include cells from the opposite edge.\n\nLet's write a Python script to simulate one step of the Game of Life on the given grid.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_wrapped_index(index, max_index):\n    \"\"\"Get the wrapped index for a toroidal array.\"\"\"\n    return index % max_index\n\ndef count_live_neighbors(grid, x, y):\n    \"\"\"Count the number of live neighbors for a cell at position (x, y).\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    live_neighbors = 0\n    for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:\n        for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            if dx != 0 or dy != 0:  # Exclude the cell itself\n                nx = get_wrapped_index(x + dx, rows)\n                ny = get_wrapped_index(y + dy, cols)\n                live_neighbors += grid[nx, ny]\n    return live_neighbors\n\ndef game_of_life_step(grid):\n    \"\"\"Perform one step of the Game of Life.\"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    new_grid = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=int)\n    for x in range(rows):\n        for y in range(cols):\n            live_neighbors = count_live_neighbors(grid, x, y)\n            if grid[x, y] == 1:\n                if live_neighbors == 2 or live_neighbors == 3:\n                    new_grid[x, y] = 1\n            else:\n                if live_neighbors == 3:\n                    new_grid[x, y] = 1\n    return new_grid\n\n# Initial grid\ninitial_grid = np.array([\n    [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1],\n    [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n])\n\n# Perform one step\nnew_grid = game_of_life_step(initial_grid)\n\n# Convert to list of lists for JSON format\nnew_grid_list = new_grid.tolist()\n\nprint(new_grid_list)\n```\n\nThis script will simulate one step of the Game of Life on the given grid and output the resulting grid in JSON format.",
