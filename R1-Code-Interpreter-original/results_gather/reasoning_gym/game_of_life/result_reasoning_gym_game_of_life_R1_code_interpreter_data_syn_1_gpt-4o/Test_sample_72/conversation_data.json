    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate one step of Conway's Game of Life on the given grid. The rules for the Game of Life are as follows:\n\n1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.\n2. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.\n3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.\n\nThe grid has a wrapping topology, meaning the edges are connected to form a torus. This means that the neighbors of a cell on the edge of the grid include cells from the opposite edge.\n\nLet's write a Python script to simulate one step of the Game of Life on the given grid.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef count_neighbors(grid, x, y):\n    # Count live neighbors in a wrapping grid\n    neighbors = [\n        (-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1),\n        (0, -1),         (0, 1),\n        (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)\n    ]\n    count = 0\n    for dx, dy in neighbors:\n        nx, ny = (x + dx) % grid.shape[0], (y + dy) % grid.shape[1]\n        count += grid[nx, ny]\n    return count\n\ndef game_of_life_step(grid):\n    new_grid = np.zeros(grid.shape, dtype=int)\n    for x in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for y in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            live_neighbors = count_neighbors(grid, x, y)\n            if grid[x, y] == 1:\n                if live_neighbors == 2 or live_neighbors == 3:\n                    new_grid[x, y] = 1\n            else:\n                if live_neighbors == 3:\n                    new_grid[x, y] = 1\n    return new_grid\n\n# Initial grid\ngrid = np.array([\n    [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0],\n    [1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0],\n    [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n])\n\n# Simulate one step\nnew_grid = game_of_life_step(grid)\n\n# Convert to list of lists for JSON format\nresult = new_grid.tolist()\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will simulate one step of the Game of Life on the given grid and output the resulting grid in JSON format.",
