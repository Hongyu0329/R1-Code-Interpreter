    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate one step of Conway's Game of Life on the given grid. The rules for the Game of Life are as follows:\n\n1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.\n2. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.\n3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.\n\nGiven the wrapping topology, the grid behaves as if it is connected at the edges, meaning the grid wraps around both horizontally and vertically.\n\nLet's write a Python script to simulate one step of the Game of Life on the provided grid.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef count_neighbors(grid, x, y):\n    # Count live neighbors with wrapping\n    neighbors = [\n        (-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1),\n        (0, -1),         (0, 1),\n        (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)\n    ]\n    count = 0\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    for dx, dy in neighbors:\n        nx, ny = (x + dx) % rows, (y + dy) % cols\n        count += grid[nx, ny]\n    return count\n\ndef game_of_life_step(grid):\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    new_grid = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=int)\n    for x in range(rows):\n        for y in range(cols):\n            live_neighbors = count_neighbors(grid, x, y)\n            if grid[x, y] == 1:\n                if live_neighbors in [2, 3]:\n                    new_grid[x, y] = 1\n            else:\n                if live_neighbors == 3:\n                    new_grid[x, y] = 1\n    return new_grid\n\n# Initial grid\ninitial_grid = np.array([\n    [0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n])\n\n# Simulate one step\nnext_grid = game_of_life_step(initial_grid)\n\n# Convert to list of lists for JSON format\nnext_grid_list = next_grid.tolist()\n\nprint(next_grid_list)\n```\n\nThis code will simulate one step of the Game of Life on the given grid and output the resulting grid in JSON format.",
