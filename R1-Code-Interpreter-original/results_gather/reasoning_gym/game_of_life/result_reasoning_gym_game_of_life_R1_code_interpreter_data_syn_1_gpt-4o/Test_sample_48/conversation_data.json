    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate one step of Conway's Game of Life on the given grid. The rules of the Game of Life are as follows:\n\n1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.\n2. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.\n3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.\n\nThe grid has a wrapping topology, meaning the edges are connected to form a torus. This means that the neighbors of a cell on the edge of the grid include cells from the opposite edge.\n\nLet's write a Python script to simulate one step of the Game of Life on the given grid.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef count_neighbors(grid, x, y):\n    # Count live neighbors with wrapping\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    return sum(grid[(x+i)%rows, (y+j)%cols] for i in [-1, 0, 1] for j in [-1, 0, 1] if not (i == 0 and j == 0))\n\ndef game_of_life_step(grid):\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    new_grid = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=int)\n    for x in range(rows):\n        for y in range(cols):\n            live_neighbors = count_neighbors(grid, x, y)\n            if grid[x, y] == 1:\n                if live_neighbors in [2, 3]:\n                    new_grid[x, y] = 1\n            else:\n                if live_neighbors == 3:\n                    new_grid[x, y] = 1\n    return new_grid\n\n# Initial grid\ninitial_grid = np.array([\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0],\n    [1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n])\n\n# Simulate one step\nnext_grid = game_of_life_step(initial_grid)\n\n# Convert to list of lists for JSON format\nresult = next_grid.tolist()\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis script will simulate one step of the Game of Life on the given grid and output the resulting grid in JSON format.",
