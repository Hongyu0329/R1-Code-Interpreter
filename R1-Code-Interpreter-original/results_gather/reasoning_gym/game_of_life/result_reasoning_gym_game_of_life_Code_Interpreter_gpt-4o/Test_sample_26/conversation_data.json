    "\nassistant > To simulate one step of Conway's Game of Life on the given board with a Moore neighborhood and wrapping topology, we need to apply the following rules to each cell:\n\n1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.\n2. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.\n3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.\n\nThe wrapping topology means that the grid behaves as if it is connected at the edges, forming a torus.
