    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the rules of Conway's Game of Life to the given grid for one step. The rules are as follows:\n\n1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.\n2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.\n3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.\n4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n\nAdditionally, we are using a Moore neighborhood, which means each cell has eight neighbors (including diagonals), and a wrapping topology, meaning the grid wraps around at the edges.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Live Cells and Their Neighbors:**\n   - For each cell, count the number of live neighbors considering the wrapping topology.\n\n2. **Apply the Rules:**\n   - For each cell, determine its next state based on the number of live neighbors and the rules above.\n\n3. **Construct the New Grid:**\n   - Update the grid with the new states of each cell.\n\nLet's go through the grid:\n\n- **Row 0:**\n  - Cell (0,2) is live and has 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n  - Cell (0,8) is live and has 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n\n- **Row 1:**\n  - Cell (1,2) is live and has 2 live neighbors, so it stays alive.\n  - Cell (1,8) is live and has 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n\n- **Row 2:**\n  - Cell (2,3) is live and has 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n\n- **Row 3:**\n  - Cell (3,2) is live and has 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n\n- **Row 5:**\n  - Cell (5,6) is live and has 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n  - Cell (5,7) is live and has 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n\n- **Row 6:**\n  - Cell (6,2) is live and has 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n\n- **Row 8:**\n  - Cell (8,6) is live and has 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n\n- **Row 9:**\n  - Cell (9,5) is live and has 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n\nAfter applying the rules, the new grid is:\n\n```\n[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]>>>"
