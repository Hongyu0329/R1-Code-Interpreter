    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate one step of Conway's Game of Life on the given 10x10 grid. The rules of the Game of Life are as follows:\n\n1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.\n2. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.\n3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.\n\nAdditionally, we are using a Moore neighborhood, which means each cell has eight neighbors, and a wrapping topology, meaning the grid edges wrap around.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Live Cells and Neighbors:**\n   - We need to count the number of live neighbors for each cell. Since the grid wraps around, the neighbors of a cell at the edge will include cells from the opposite edge.\n\n2. **Apply the Rules:**\n   - For each cell, apply the rules of the Game of Life based on the count of live neighbors.\n\n3. **Construct the New Grid:**\n   - Create a new grid based on the results of applying the rules.\n\nLet's go through the grid:\n\n- **Row 0:** All cells are dead and have no live neighbors, so they remain dead.\n- **Row 1:** All cells are dead and have no live neighbors, so they remain dead.\n- **Row 2:** The cell at (2,5) is alive and has one live neighbor, so it dies. All other cells remain dead.\n- **Row 3:** The cell at (3,7) is alive and has two live neighbors, so it survives. The cell at (3,8) is alive and has one live neighbor, so it dies. The cell at (3,6) is dead and has three live neighbors, so it becomes alive.\n- **Row 4:** All cells are dead and have no live neighbors, so they remain dead.\n- **Row 5:** The cell at (5,3) is alive and has no live neighbors, so it dies. All other cells remain dead.\n- **Row 6:** The cell at (6,9) is alive and has one live neighbor, so it dies. All other cells remain dead.\n- **Row 7:** The cell at (7,0) is alive and has one live neighbor, so it dies. The cell at (7,4) is alive and has no live neighbors, so it dies. The cell at (7,6) is alive and has no live neighbors, so it dies. The cell at (7,9) is alive and has one live neighbor, so it dies. All other cells remain dead.\n- **Row 8:** All cells are dead and have no live neighbors, so they remain dead.\n- **Row 9:** The cell at (9,4) is alive and has no live neighbors, so it dies. All other cells remain dead.\n\nAfter applying these rules, the new grid is:\n\n```json\n<<<[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n     [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n     [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n     [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0],\n     [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n     [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n     [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n     [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n     [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n     [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]>>>\n```"
