    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate one step of Conway's Game of Life on the given 10x10 grid. The rules of the Game of Life are as follows:\n\n1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.\n2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.\n3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.\n4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n\nAdditionally, we are using a Moore neighborhood, which means each cell has eight neighbors (including diagonals), and a wrapping topology, meaning the grid edges wrap around.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Live Neighbors**: For each cell, count the number of live neighbors. Remember to wrap around the edges of the grid.\n\n2. **Apply Rules**: Based on the number of live neighbors, apply the rules of the Game of Life to determine if each cell will be alive or dead in the next generation.\n\n3. **Construct the New Grid**: Create a new grid based on the results of applying the rules.\n\nLet's go through the grid:\n\n- **Row 0**: \n  - Cell (0,0): 1 live neighbor → Dies (underpopulation).\n  - Cell (0,1): 2 live neighbors → Stays dead.\n  - Cell (0,2): 1 live neighbor → Stays dead.\n  - Cell (0,3): 1 live neighbor → Stays dead.\n  - Cell (0,4): 1 live neighbor → Stays dead.\n  - Cell (0,5): 1 live neighbor → Stays dead.\n  - Cell (0,6): 1 live neighbor → Stays dead.\n  - Cell (0,7): 2 live neighbors → Stays dead.\n  - Cell (0,8): 1 live neighbor → Dies (underpopulation).\n  - Cell (0,9): 2 live neighbors → Stays dead.\n\n- **Row 1**:\n  - Cell (1,0): 1 live neighbor → Stays dead.\n  - Cell (1,1): 1 live neighbor → Stays dead.\n  - Cell (1,2): 2 live neighbors → Stays dead.\n  -
