    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate one step of Conway's Game of Life on the given 10x10 grid. The rules of the Game of Life are as follows:\n\n1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.\n2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.\n3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.\n4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n\nAdditionally, we are using a Moore neighborhood, which means each cell has 8 neighbors (including diagonals), and a wrapping topology, meaning the grid wraps around at the edges.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the neighbors for each cell**: For each cell, count the number of live neighbors. Remember that the grid wraps around, so the neighbors of edge cells include cells from the opposite edge.\n\n2. **Apply the Game of Life rules**: For each cell, determine its next state based on the number of live neighbors:\n   - If the cell is alive and has fewer than 2 or more than 3 live neighbors, it dies.\n   - If the cell is alive and has 2 or 3 live neighbors, it remains alive.\n   - If the cell is dead and has exactly 3 live neighbors, it becomes alive.\n\n3. **Construct the new grid**: After applying the rules to each cell, construct the new grid representing the next state.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given grid:\n\n- For each cell, calculate the number of live neighbors considering the wrapping topology.\n- Update each cell based on the Game of Life rules.\n\nAfter performing these calculations, the grid after one step of simulation is:\n\n```\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\nThus, the final answer in JSON format is:\n\n<<<[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]>>>"
