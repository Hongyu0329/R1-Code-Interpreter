    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the rules of Conway's Game of Life to the given grid for one step. The rules are as follows:\n\n1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.\n2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.\n3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.\n4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n\nAdditionally, we are using a Moore neighborhood, which means each cell has eight neighbors, and a wrapping topology, meaning the grid edges wrap around.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Live Neighbors**: For each cell, count the number of live neighbors considering the wrapping topology.\n\n2. **Apply Rules**: Based on the number of live neighbors, determine the next state of each cell using the rules above.\n\n3. **Construct the New Grid**: Create a new grid based on the next state of each cell.\n\nLet's go through the grid:\n\n- **Row 0**: \n  - Cell (0,3) has 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n  - Cell (0,1) has 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n  - Cell (0,8) has 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n\n- **Row 1**:\n  - Cell (1,1) has 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n  - Cell (1,8) has 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Cell (2,7) has 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - Cell (4,3) has 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n\n- **Row 5**:\n  - Cell (5,3) has 2 live neighbors, so it lives.\n\n- **Row 6**:\n  - Cell (6,5) has 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n  - Cell (6,8) has 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n\n- **Row 7**:\n  - Cell (7,2) has 2 live neighbors, so it lives.\n  - Cell (7,4) has 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n\nAfter applying the rules, the new grid is:\n\n```\n[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]>>>"
