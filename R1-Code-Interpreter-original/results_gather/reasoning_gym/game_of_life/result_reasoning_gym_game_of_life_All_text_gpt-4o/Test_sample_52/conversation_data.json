    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the rules of Conway's Game of Life to the given grid for one step. The rules are as follows:\n\n1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.\n2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.\n3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.\n4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n\nAdditionally, we are using a Moore neighborhood, which means each cell has eight neighbors, and a wrapping topology, meaning the grid edges wrap around.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Live Cells and Their Neighbors:**\n   - We need to count the number of live neighbors for each cell. The grid wraps around, so the neighbors of edge cells include cells from the opposite edge.\n\n2. **Apply the Rules:**\n   - For each cell, apply the rules based on the number of live neighbors.\n\n3. **Update the Grid:**\n   - Create a new grid based on the results of applying the rules.\n\nLet's go through the grid:\n\n- **Row 0:** All cells are dead and have no live neighbors, so they remain dead.\n- **Row 1:** All cells are dead and have no live neighbors, so they remain dead.\n- **Row 2:** The cell at (2,8) is alive and has 1 live neighbor, so it dies. All other cells remain dead.\n- **Row 3:** The cell at (3,7) is alive and has 2 live neighbors, so it stays alive. The cell at (3,8) is dead and has 3 live neighbors, so it becomes alive.\n- **Row 4:** The cell at (4,0) is alive and has 1 live neighbor, so it dies. The cell at (4,8) is alive and has 2 live neighbors, so it stays alive.\n- **Row 5:** The cell at (5,9) is alive and has 1 live neighbor, so it dies. The cell at (5,8) is dead and has 3 live neighbors, so it becomes alive.\n- **Row 6:** All cells are dead and have no live neighbors, so they remain dead.\n- **Row 7:** The cell at (7,0) is alive and has 1 live neighbor, so it dies. The cell at (7,6) is alive and has 1 live neighbor, so it dies. The cell at (7,8) is alive and has 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n- **Row 8:** The cell at (8,5) is alive and has 1 live neighbor, so it dies. The cell at (8,6) is dead and has 3 live neighbors, so it becomes alive.\n- **Row 9:** All cells are dead and have no live neighbors, so they remain dead.\n\nAfter applying these rules, the new grid is:\n\n```\n[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]\n```\n\nThe final answer in JSON format is:\n\n<<<[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]>>>"
