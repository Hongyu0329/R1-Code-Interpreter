    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the rules of Conway's Game of Life to the given grid for one step. The rules are as follows:\n\n1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.\n2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.\n3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.\n4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n\nAdditionally, we are using a Moore neighborhood, which means each cell has eight neighbors, and a wrapping topology, meaning the grid wraps around at the edges.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the neighbors for each cell**: Since the grid wraps around, the neighbors of a cell at the edge will include cells from the opposite edge.\n\n2. **Apply the rules**: For each cell, count the number of live neighbors and apply the rules to determine if the cell will be alive or dead in the next generation.\n\n3. **Construct the new grid**: Based on the rules applied, construct the new grid.\n\nLet's go through the grid:\n\n- For the row at index 5, the cells [1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0] will change as follows:\n  - The first three cells form a horizontal line, which is a common pattern in the Game of Life known as a \"blinker\". This pattern will oscillate between horizontal and vertical lines. So, the first three cells will become [0,1,0].\n  - The cell at index 4 will die due to underpopulation (only 1 neighbor).\n  - The rest of the cells remain dead.\n\n- For the row at index 6, the cells [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0] will change as follows:\n  - The cell at index 7 will die due to underpopulation (only 1 neighbor).\n\n- For the row at index 7, the cells [0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0] will change as follows:\n  - The cell at index 2 will die due to underpopulation (only 1 neighbor).\n  - The cell at index 5 will die due to underpopulation (only 1 neighbor).\n\n- For the row at index 8, the cells [0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0] will change as follows:\n  - The cell at index 1 will die due to underpopulation (only 1 neighbor).\n  - The cell at index 3 will die due to underpopulation (only 1 neighbor).\n\nAfter applying these rules to the entire grid, the new grid will be:\n\n```json\n[\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n]\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]>>>"
