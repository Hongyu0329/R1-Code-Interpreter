    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the rules of Conway's Game of Life to the given grid for one step. The rules are as follows:\n\n1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.\n2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.\n3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.\n4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n\nAdditionally, we are using a Moore neighborhood, which means each cell has eight neighbors, and a wrapping topology, meaning the grid edges wrap around.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Live Neighbors**: For each cell, count the number of live neighbors. Remember to wrap around the edges.\n\n2. **Apply Rules**: Based on the number of live neighbors, determine the next state of each cell using the rules above.\n\n3. **Construct the New Grid**: After applying the rules to each cell, construct the new grid.\n\nLet's go through the grid:\n\n- **Row 0**: \n  - All cells are dead. No dead cell has exactly three live neighbors, so no change.\n\n- **Row 1**: \n  - Cell (1,0) is alive with 0 live neighbors, so it dies.\n  - All other cells are dead and do not have exactly three live neighbors, so no change.\n\n- **Row 2**: \n  - All cells are dead. No dead cell has exactly three live neighbors, so no change.\n\n- **Row 3**: \n  - Cell (3,7) is alive with 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n  - All other cells are dead and do not have exactly three live neighbors, so no change.\n\n- **Row 4**: \n  - Cell (4,1) is alive with 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n  - Cell (4,6) is alive with 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n  - All other cells are dead and do not have exactly three live neighbors, so no change.\n\n- **Row 5**: \n  - All cells are dead. No dead cell has exactly three live neighbors, so no change.\n\n- **Row 6**: \n  - All cells are dead. No dead cell has exactly three live neighbors, so no change.\n\n- **Row 7**: \n  - Cell (7,4) is alive with 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n  - Cell (7,6) is alive with 2 live neighbors, so it lives.\n  - All other cells are dead and do not have exactly three live neighbors, so no change.\n\n- **Row 8**: \n  - Cell (8,7) is alive with 2 live neighbors, so it lives.\n  - Cell (8,8) is alive with 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n  - All other cells are dead and do not have exactly three live neighbors, so no change.\n\n- **Row 9**: \n  - Cell (9,1) is alive with 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n  - Cell (9,2) is alive with 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n  - All other cells are dead and do not have exactly three live neighbors, so no change.\n\nAfter applying these rules, the new grid is:\n\n```\n[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]\n```\n\nThe final answer in JSON format is:\n\n<<<[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]>>>"
