    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the rules of Conway's Game of Life to the given grid for one step. The rules are as follows:\n\n1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.\n2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.\n3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.\n4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n\nAdditionally, we are using a Moore neighborhood, which means each cell has eight neighbors, and a wrapping topology, meaning the grid edges wrap around.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the neighbors for each cell**: Since the grid wraps around, the neighbors of a cell at the edge will include cells from the opposite edge.\n\n2. **Apply the rules**: For each cell, count the number of live neighbors and apply the rules to determine if the cell will be alive or dead in the next generation.\n\n3. **Construct the new grid**: Based on the rules applied, construct the new grid.\n\nLet's go through the grid:\n\n- **Row 0**: \n  - Cell (0,0) has 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n  - Cell (0,1) has 2 live neighbors, so it remains dead.\n  - Cell (0,2) has 1 live neighbor, so it remains dead.\n  - Cell (0,3) has 1 live neighbor, so it remains dead.\n  - Cell (0,4) has 0 live neighbors, so it remains dead.\n  - Cell (0,5) has 0 live neighbors, so it remains dead.\n  - Cell (0,6) has 1 live neighbor, so it remains dead.\n  - Cell (0,7) has 2 live neighbors, so it remains dead.\n  - Cell (0,8) has 2 live neighbors, so it remains dead.\n  - Cell (0,9) has 2 live neighbors, so it remains dead.\n\n- **Row 1**:\n  - Cell (1,0) has 1 live neighbor, so it remains dead.\n  - Cell (1,1) has 1 live neighbor, so it remains dead.\n  -
