    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the rules of Conway's Game of Life to the given grid for one step. The rules are as follows:\n\n1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.\n2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.\n3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.\n4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n\nAdditionally, we are using a Moore neighborhood, which means each cell has eight neighbors, and a wrapping topology, meaning the grid wraps around at the edges.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Live Cells and Their Neighbors:**\n   - We need to count the number of live neighbors for each cell. Since the grid wraps around, the neighbors of edge cells include cells from the opposite edge.\n\n2. **Apply the Rules:**\n   - For each cell, apply the rules based on the number of live neighbors.\n\n3. **Update the Grid:**\n   - Create a new grid based on the results of applying the rules.\n\nLet's go through the grid:\n\n- **Row 3, Column 1 (0,1):** Has 1 live neighbor, remains dead.\n- **Row 3, Column 2 (1,1):** Has 1 live neighbor, remains dead.\n- **Row 3, Column 3 (1,0):** Has 1 live neighbor, remains dead.\n- **Row 4, Column 2 (1,1):** Has 1 live neighbor, remains dead.\n- **Row 4, Column 3 (1,0):** Has 2 live neighbors, remains alive.\n- **Row 4, Column 4 (0,1):** Has 1 live neighbor, remains dead.\n- **Row 4, Column 8 (1,0):** Has 1 live neighbor, remains dead.\n- **Row 5, Column 3 (1,0):** Has 2 live neighbors, remains alive.\n- **Row 5, Column 4 (0,1):** Has 1 live neighbor, remains dead.\n- **Row 5, Column 8 (1,0):** Has 1 live neighbor, remains dead.\n- **Row 6, Column 4 (0,1):** Has 1 live neighbor, remains dead.\n- **Row 6, Column 7 (1,0):** Has 1 live neighbor, remains dead.\n- **Row 7, Column 5 (1,0):** Has 1 live neighbor, remains dead.\n- **Row 8, Column 8 (1,1):** Has 1 live neighbor, remains dead.\n- **Row 8, Column 9 (1,1):** Has 1 live neighbor, remains dead.\n- **Row 9, Column 8 (1,0):** Has 1 live neighbor, remains dead.\n\nAfter applying the rules to each cell, the updated grid is:\n\n```\n[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]\n```\n\nThe final grid after one step of simulation is:\n\n<<<[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]>>>"
