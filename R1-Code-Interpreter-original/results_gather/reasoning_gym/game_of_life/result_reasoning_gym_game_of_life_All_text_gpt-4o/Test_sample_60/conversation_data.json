    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate one step of Conway's Game of Life on the given 10x10 grid. The rules of the Game of Life are as follows:\n\n1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.\n2. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.\n3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.\n\nAdditionally, we are using a Moore neighborhood, which means each cell has eight neighbors (including diagonals), and a wrapping topology, meaning the grid edges wrap around to the opposite side.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the neighbors for each cell**: Since the grid wraps around, the neighbors of a cell at the edge will include cells from the opposite edge.\n\n2. **Apply the Game of Life rules**: For each cell, count the number of live neighbors and apply the rules to determine if the cell will be alive or dead in the next generation.\n\n3. **Construct the new grid**: Based on the rules applied, construct the new grid representing the state of the board after one step.\n\nLet's go through the grid:\n\n- **Row 0**: \n  - Cell (0,0) has 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n  - Cell (0,9) has 1 live neighbor, so it stays dead.\n\n- **Row 1**:\n  - Cell (1,9) has 2 live neighbors, so it stays dead.\n\n- **Row 2**:\n  - Cell (2,9) has 1 live neighbor, so it stays dead.\n\n- **Row 3**:\n  - All cells have fewer than 3 live neighbors, so they stay dead.\n\n- **Row 4**:\n  - Cell (4,1) has 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n\n- **Row 5**:\n  - Cell (5,0) has 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n\n- **Row 6**:\n  - Cell (6,8) has 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n\n- **Row 7**:\n  - Cell (7,2) has 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n\n- **Row 8**:\n  - Cell (8,9) has 1 live neighbor, so it stays dead.\n\n- **Row 9**:\n  - Cell (9,8) has 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n\nAfter applying the rules to each cell, the new grid is:\n\n```\n[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]>>>"
