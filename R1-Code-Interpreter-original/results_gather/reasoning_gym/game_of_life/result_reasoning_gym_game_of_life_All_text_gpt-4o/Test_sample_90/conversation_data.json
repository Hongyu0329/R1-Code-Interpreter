    "To solve this problem, we need to apply the rules of Conway's Game of Life to the given grid for one step. The rules are as follows:\n\n1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.\n2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.\n3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.\n4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n\nAdditionally, we are using a Moore neighborhood, which means each cell has eight neighbors, and a wrapping topology, meaning the grid wraps around at the edges.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Live Cells and Their Neighbors:**\n   - For each cell, count the number of live neighbors considering the wrapping topology.\n\n2. **Apply the Rules:**\n   - For each cell, apply the Game of Life rules based on the number of live neighbors.\n\n3. **Update the Grid:**\n   - Create a new grid based on the results of applying the rules.\n\nLet's go through the grid:\n\n- **Row 1:** All cells are dead and have no live neighbors, so they remain dead.\n- **Row 2:** \n  - Cells (2,5) and (2,6) are live with 1 live neighbor each, so they die.\n- **Row 3:** All cells are dead and have no live neighbors, so they remain dead.\n- **Row 4:** \n  - Cell (4,8) is live with 0 live neighbors, so it dies.\n- **Row 5:** All cells are dead and have no live neighbors, so they remain dead.\n- **Row 6:** \n  - Cell (6,5) is live with 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n- **Row 7:** \n  - Cell (7,3) is live with 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n- **Row 8:** \n  - Cell (8,4) is live with 2 live neighbors, so it lives.\n- **Row 9:** \n  - Cell (9,4) is live with 2 live neighbors, so it lives.\n  - Cell (9,7) is live with 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n- **Row 10:** \n  - Cell (10,3) is live with 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n  - Cell (10,5) is live with 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n\nAfter applying the rules, the new grid is:\n\n```\n[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]\n```\n\nThus, the final grid after one step of simulation is:\n\n<<<[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]>>>"
