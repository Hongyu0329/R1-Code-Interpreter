    "To determine the next state of the Game of Life board, we need to apply the rules of the game to each cell. The rules are as follows:\n\n1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.\n2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.\n3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.\n4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n\nGiven the wrapping topology, the grid behaves as if it is connected at the edges, meaning the grid wraps around both horizontally and vertically.\n\nLet's analyze the given grid step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Grid:**\n   ```\n   [[0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]\n   ```\n\n2. **Apply the Rules:**\n   - For each cell, count the number of live neighbors considering the wrapping topology.\n   - Update the cell state based on the rules.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n   - **Row 0:**\n     - Cell (0,1) has 0 live neighbors, it dies.\n     - Cell (0,4) has 1 live neighbor, it dies.\n     - Cell (0,6) has 0 live neighbors, it dies.\n   - **Row 1 to Row 4:**\n     - All cells have 0 live neighbors, they remain dead.\n   - **Row 5:**\n     - Cell (5,1) has 0 live neighbors, it dies.\n     - Cell (5,4) has 1 live neighbor, it dies.\n   - **Row 6:**\n     - Cell (6,8) has 3 live neighbors, it lives.\n     - Cell (6,9) has 3 live neighbors, it lives.\n   - **Row 7:**\n     - Cell (7,8) has 3 live neighbors, it lives.\n     - Cell (7,9) has 3 live neighbors, it lives.\n   - **Row 8:**\n     - Cell (8,6) has 1 live neighbor, it dies.\n   - **Row 9:**\n     - All cells have 0 live neighbors, they remain dead.\n\n4. **Final Grid:**\n   ```\n   [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]\n   ```\n\nThe final state of the board after one step of simulation is:\n\n<<<[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]>>>"
