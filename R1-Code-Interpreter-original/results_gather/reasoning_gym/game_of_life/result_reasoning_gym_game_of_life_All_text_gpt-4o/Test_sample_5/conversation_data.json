    "To determine the next state of the Game of Life board, we need to apply the rules of the game to each cell. The rules are as follows:\n\n1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.\n2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.\n3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.\n4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n\nGiven the wrapping topology, the grid behaves as if it is connected at the edges, meaning the grid wraps around both horizontally and vertically.\n\nLet's analyze the board step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the neighbors for each cell**: Since we have a wrapping topology, the neighbors of a cell at the edge of the grid include cells from the opposite edge.\n\n2. **Apply the rules**: For each cell, count the number of live neighbors and apply the rules to determine if the cell will be alive or dead in the next generation.\n\n3. **Construct the new grid**: Based on the results from step 2, construct the new grid.\n\nLet's go through the grid:\n\n- **Row 0**: \n  - Cell (0,1) has 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n  - Cell (0,5) has 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n\n- **Row 1**:\n  - Cell (1,7) has 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n\n- **Row 6**:\n  - Cell (6,1) has 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n  - Cell (6,6) has 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n\n- **Row 7**:\n  - Cell (7,2) has 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n  - Cell (7,8) has 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n\n- **Row 9**:\n  - Cell (9,1) has 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n  - Cell (9,4) has 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n  - Cell (9,8) has 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n\nAll other cells have fewer than 3 live neighbors and remain dead.\n\nAfter applying these rules, the grid after 1 step of simulation is:\n\n```\n[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]>>>"
