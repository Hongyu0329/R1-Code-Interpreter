    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate one step of Conway's Game of Life on the given 10x10 grid. The rules of the Game of Life are as follows:\n\n1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.\n2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.\n3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.\n4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n\nAdditionally, we are using a Moore neighborhood, which means each cell has 8 neighbors (including diagonals), and a wrapping topology, meaning the grid edges wrap around.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Live Cells and Their Neighbors:**\n   - We need to count the number of live neighbors for each cell. Since the grid wraps around, the neighbors of edge cells include cells from the opposite edge.\n\n2. **Apply the Rules:**\n   - For each cell, apply the rules of the Game of Life based on the count of live neighbors.\n\n3. **Update the Grid:**\n   - Create a new grid based on the results of applying the rules.\n\nLet's go through the grid:\n\n- **Row 0:**\n  - Cell (0,8) is live and has 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n  - Cell (0,4) and (0,5) have 3 live neighbors, so they become live.\n\n- **Row 1:**\n  - Cell (1,4) and (1,5) are live and have 1 and 2 live neighbors, respectively. Cell (1,4) dies, and (1,5) stays alive.\n  - Cell (1,3) and (1,6) have 3 live neighbors, so they become live.\n\n- **Row 4:**\n  - Cell (4,7) is live and has 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n\n- **Row 5:**\n  - Cell (5,9) is live and has 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n  - Cell (5,8) has 3 live neighbors, so it becomes live.\n\n- **Row 6:**\n  - Cell (6,0) is live and has 1 live neighbor, so it dies.\n  - Cell (6,7) is live and has 2 live neighbors, so it stays alive.\n  - Cell (6,8) has 3 live neighbors, so it becomes live.\n\n- **Row 7:**\n  - Cell (7,4) and (7,5) are live and have 1 and 2 live neighbors, respectively. Cell (7,4) dies, and (7,5) stays alive.\n  - Cell (7,3) and (7,6) have 3 live neighbors, so they become live.\n\nNow, let's construct the new grid:\n\n```json\n[\n [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0],\n [0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n]\n```\n\nThus, the grid after one step of simulation is:\n\n<<<\n[\n [0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0],\n [0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n]\n>>>"
