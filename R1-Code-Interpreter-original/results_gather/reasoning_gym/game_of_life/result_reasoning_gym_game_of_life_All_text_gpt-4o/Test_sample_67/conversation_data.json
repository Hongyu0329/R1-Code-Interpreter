    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate one step of Conway's Game of Life on the given 10x10 grid. The rules of the Game of Life are as follows:\n\n1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.\n2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.\n3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.\n4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n\nAdditionally, we are using a Moore neighborhood, which means each cell has 8 possible neighbors (including diagonals), and a wrapping topology, meaning the grid wraps around at the edges.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Live Cells and Their Neighbors:**\n   - We need to count the number of live neighbors for each cell. This includes checking all 8 surrounding cells, considering the wrapping topology.\n\n2. **Apply the Rules:**\n   - For each cell, apply the rules of the Game of Life based on the count of live neighbors.\n\n3. **Update the Grid:**\n   - Create a new grid based on the results of applying the rules.\n\nLet's go through the grid:\n\n- **Row 0:** All cells are dead. No changes.\n- **Row 1:** \n  - Cell (1,4) is live with 1 live neighbor (dies).\n- **Row 2:** \n  - Cell (2,3) is live with 2 live neighbors (lives).\n- **Row 3:** \n  - Cell (3,2) is live with 1 live neighbor (dies).\n  - Cell (3,6) is live with 1 live neighbor (dies).\n  - Cell (3,9) is live with 0 live neighbors (dies).\n- **Row 4:** All cells are dead. No changes.\n- **Row 5:** All cells are dead. No changes.\n- **Row 6:** \n  - Cell (6,6) is live with 1 live neighbor (dies).\n  - Cell (6,8) is live with 1 live neighbor (dies).\n- **Row 7:** All cells are dead. No changes.\n- **Row 8:** \n  - Cell (8,1) is live with 0 live neighbors (dies).\n- **Row 9:** \n  - Cell (9,7) is live with 1 live neighbor (dies).\n  - Cell (9,9) is live with 0 live neighbors (dies).\n\nAfter applying the rules, the updated grid is:\n\n```\n[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]\n```\n\nThe final grid after one step of simulation is:\n\n<<<[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]>>>"
