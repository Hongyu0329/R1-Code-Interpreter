  "question": "Given two strings representing a ransom note and a magazine, return True if you can construct the ransom note using the letters in the magazine, and False otherwise. Make sure to enclose the answer within triple angle brackets, i.e. \"<<<True>>>\"/\"<<<False>>>\".\n\nEach letter in the magazine string can only be used once in your ransom note.\n\nRansom note: vdpaew\nMagazine: uwpoqcdeqbhmjatj\n",

    "To determine if the ransom note can be constructed from the magazine, we need to ensure that each letter in the ransom note can be matched with a corresponding letter in the magazine. Each letter in the magazine can only be used once, so we must carefully track the availability of each letter.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Count the Letters in the Ransom Note:**\n   - We need to count the occurrences of each letter in the ransom note \"vdpaew\".\n   - v: 1\n   - d: 1\n   - p: 1\n   - a: 1\n   - e: 1\n   - w: 1\n\n2. **Count the Letters in the Magazine:**\n   - We need to count the occurrences of each letter in the magazine \"uwpoqcdeqbhmjatj\".\n   - u: 1\n   - w: 1\n   - p: 1\n   - o: 1\n   - q: 2\n   - c: 1\n   - d: 1\n   - e: 1\n   - b: 1\n   - h: 1\n   - m: 1\n   - j: 2\n   - a: 1\n   - t: 1\n\n3. **Compare the Counts:**\n   - For each letter in the ransom note, check if the magazine contains at least as many of that letter.\n   - v: The ransom note requires 1 'v', but the magazine has 0 'v'. This means we cannot construct the ransom note.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the magazine does not have enough 'v' letters to match the ransom note's requirement, it is impossible to construct the ransom note from the magazine.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<False>>>"
