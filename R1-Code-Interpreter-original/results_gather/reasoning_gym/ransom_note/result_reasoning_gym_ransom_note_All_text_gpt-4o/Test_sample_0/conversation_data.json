  "question": "Given two strings representing a ransom note and a magazine, return True if you can construct the ransom note using the letters in the magazine, and False otherwise. Make sure to enclose the answer within triple angle brackets, i.e. \"<<<True>>>\"/\"<<<False>>>\".\n\nEach letter in the magazine string can only be used once in your ransom note.\n\nRansom note: lg\nMagazine: gaputvhl\n",

    "To determine if the ransom note can be constructed from the magazine, we need to ensure that each letter in the ransom note can be matched with a corresponding letter in the magazine. Each letter in the magazine can only be used once.\n\nLet's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Characters in the Ransom Note:**\n   - The ransom note is \"lg\". This means we need one 'l' and one 'g'.\n\n2. **Count the Characters in the Ransom Note:**\n   - 'l': 1\n   - 'g': 1\n\n3. **Identify the Characters in the Magazine:**\n   - The magazine is \"gaputvhl\". This contains the letters: g, a, p, u, t, v, h, l.\n\n4. **Count the Characters in the Magazine:**\n   - 'g': 1\n   - 'a': 1\n   - 'p': 1\n   - 'u': 1\n   - 't': 1\n   - 'v': 1\n   - 'h': 1\n   - 'l': 1\n\n5. **Compare the Counts:**\n   - For 'l': The ransom note requires 1 'l', and the magazine has 1 'l'. This is sufficient.\n   - For 'g': The ransom note requires 1 'g', and the magazine has 1 'g'. This is sufficient.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since the magazine contains at least as many of each required letter as the ransom note needs, it is possible to construct the ransom note from the magazine.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that the ransom note can be constructed from the magazine.\n\n<<<True>>>"
