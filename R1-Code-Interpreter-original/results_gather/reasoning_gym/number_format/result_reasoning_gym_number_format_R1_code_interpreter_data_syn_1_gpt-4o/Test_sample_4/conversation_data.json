    "To solve this problem, we need to compare the given numbers and identify the largest one. The numbers provided are:\n\n1. 58,370,704.701\n2. 58,370,695.118000\n3. 58,370,710.728000\n4. 5.837071288900000e+07\n\nThe fourth number is in scientific notation, which is equivalent to 58,370,712.889. We will compare these numbers to find the largest one.\n\nLet's write a Python script to compare these numbers and find the largest one.\n\n```python\n# List of numbers\nnumbers = [\n    58370704.701,\n    58370695.118000,\n    58370710.728000,\n    5.837071288900000e+07\n]\n\n# Find the largest number\nlargest_number = max(numbers)\n\n# Print the largest number\nprint(largest_number)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the largest number.",
