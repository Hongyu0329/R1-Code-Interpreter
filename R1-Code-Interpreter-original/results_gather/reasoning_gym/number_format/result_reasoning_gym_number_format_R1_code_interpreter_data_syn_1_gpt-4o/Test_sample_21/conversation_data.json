    "To find the smallest number among the given candidates, we need to compare the three numbers:\n\n1. \\(4.564877633090000 \\times 10^8\\)\n2. 456,487,767.537\n3. \\(4.564877720490000 \\times 10^8\\)\n\nThe numbers are given in scientific notation and standard decimal form. To compare them, we can convert them all to the same format and then find the smallest.\n\nLet's write a Python script to compare these numbers and find the smallest one.\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers\nnum1 = 4.564877633090000e+08\nnum2 = 456487767.537\nnum3 = 4.564877720490000e+08\n\n# Find the smallest number\nsmallest = min(num1, num2, num3)\n\n# Print the smallest number\nprint(smallest)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the smallest number.",
    "The code execution has provided the smallest number among the given candidates. The smallest number is:\n\n<<<456487763.309>>>"
