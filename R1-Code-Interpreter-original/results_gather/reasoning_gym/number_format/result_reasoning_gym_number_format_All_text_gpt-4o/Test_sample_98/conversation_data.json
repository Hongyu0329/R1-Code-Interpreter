    "To determine the largest number from the given options, we need to carefully analyze each number and compare them. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Notation**: \n   - The numbers are presented in different formats, including standard decimal notation, scientific notation, and with commas as thousand separators.\n\n2. **Convert Scientific Notation**:\n   - The number `2.733224180640000e+08` is in scientific notation. This means `2.733224180640000 * 10^8`, which is equivalent to `273,322,418.064`.\n\n3. **Remove Commas**:\n   - The numbers with commas are `273,322,419.202` and `273,322,403.68700004`. These are equivalent to `273322419.202` and `273322403.68700004` respectively.\n\n4. **List the Numbers**:\n   - Now, we have the following numbers to compare:\n     - `273322413.248000`\n     - `273322418.064` (converted from scientific notation)\n     - `273322419.202`\n     - `273322416.193000`\n     - `273322403.68700004`\n\n5. **Compare the Numbers**:\n   - Compare each number to find the largest:\n     - `273322413.248000` is less than `273322418.064`.\n     - `273322418.064` is less than `273322419.202`.\n     - `273322419.202` is greater than `273322416.193000`.\n     - `273322419.202` is greater than `273322403.68700004`.\n\n6. **Identify the Largest Number**:\n   - The largest number among the options is `273322419.202`.\n\nTherefore, the largest number is:\n\n<<<273322419.202>>>"
