    "To determine the smallest number among the given candidates, we need to carefully analyze each number and compare them. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Notation**:\n   - The first number is in scientific notation: \\(5.969984901090000 \\times 10^8\\).\n   - The second number is in standard decimal form: 596,998,486.155.\n   - The third number is also in standard decimal form: 596,998,498.710000.\n\n2. **Convert Scientific Notation to Decimal**:\n   - The scientific notation \\(5.969984901090000 \\times 10^8\\) can be converted to decimal form by moving the decimal point 8 places to the right, resulting in 596,998,490.109.\n\n3. **Compare the Numbers**:\n   - Now, we have the following numbers to compare:\n     - 596,998,490.109 (converted from scientific notation)\n     - 596,998,486.155\n     - 596,998,498.710000\n\n4. **Identify the Smallest Number**:\n   - Compare the numbers:\n     - 596,998,486.155\n     - 596,998,490.109\n     - 596,998,498.710000\n   - The smallest number among these is 596,998,486.155.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number is:\n\n<<<596,998,486.155>>>"
