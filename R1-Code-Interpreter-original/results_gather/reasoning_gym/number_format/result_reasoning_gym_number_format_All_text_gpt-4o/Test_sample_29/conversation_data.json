    "To find the smallest number among the given candidates, we need to carefully compare each number. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: \n   - 181706006.723000\n   - 181,706,001.058\n   - 181,706,014.864\n   - 181,706,002.59\n   - 181706012.803000\n\n2. **Remove Commas for Consistency**: \n   - 181706006.723000\n   - 181706001.058\n   - 181706014.864\n   - 181706002.59\n   - 181706012.803000\n\n3. **Compare the Numbers**:\n   - Start by comparing the whole number part (before the decimal point) of each number.\n   - 181706001 is the smallest whole number among the candidates.\n\n4. **Verify the Smallest Number**:\n   - Since 181706001 is the smallest whole number, we need to ensure there are no smaller numbers in the decimal part that could affect the comparison.\n   - The decimal part of 181706001.058 is .058, which is smaller than the decimal parts of the other numbers.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The smallest number is 181706001.058.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number is:\n\n<<<181706001.058>>>"
