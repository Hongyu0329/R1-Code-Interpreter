    "To determine the smallest number from the given candidates, we need to carefully compare each number. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: \n   - The first number is 737915332.359000.\n   - The second number is 737,915,339.862 (note the commas, which are used for readability).\n   - The third number is 737,915,338.624.\n\n2. **Remove Commas for Consistency**:\n   - The second number becomes 737915339.862.\n   - The third number becomes 737915338.624.\n\n3. **Compare the Numbers**:\n   - Start by comparing the whole number parts (the digits before the decimal point):\n     - 737915332 (from 737915332.359000)\n     - 737915339 (from 737915339.862)\n     - 737915338 (from 737915338.624)\n   - The smallest whole number part is 737915332.\n\n4. **Verify the Smallest Number**:\n   - Since 737915332 is smaller than both 737915339 and 737915338, we can conclude that 737915332.359000 is the smallest number without needing to compare the decimal parts.\n\n5. **Final Answer**:\n   - The smallest number among the given candidates is 737915332.359000.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number is:\n\n<<<737915332.359000>>>"
