    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the smallest number among the given candidates. Let's analyze each number step by step:\n\n1. **713,597,286.739**: This number is written in standard decimal notation. It is 713,597,286.739.\n\n2. **7.135972863600000e+08**: This number is written in scientific notation. The \"e+08\" indicates that the decimal point should be moved 8 places to the right. Therefore, this number is equivalent to 713,597,286.36.\n\n3. **713,597,288.231**: This number is also written in standard decimal notation. It is 713,597,288.231.\n\nNow, let's compare these numbers:\n\n- 713,597,286.739\n- 713,597,286.36\n- 713,597,288.231\n\nTo find the smallest number, we compare them:\n\n- 713,597,286.36 is less than 713,597,286.739.\n- 713,597,286.36 is also less than 713,597,288.231.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number among the given candidates is 713,597,286.36.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<713597286.36>>>"
