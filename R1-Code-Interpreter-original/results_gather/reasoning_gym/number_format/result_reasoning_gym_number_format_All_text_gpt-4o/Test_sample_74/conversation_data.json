    "To determine the smallest number from the given options, we need to carefully analyze each number and compare them. Here are the steps to follow:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: \n   - 16764659.607000\n   - 16764668.448000\n   - 16,764,666.027\n   - 16,764,650.741\n   - 16,764,665.734000001\n\n2. **Remove Commas for Consistency**: \n   - 16764659.607000\n   - 16764668.448000\n   - 16764666.027\n   - 16764650.741\n   - 16764665.734000001\n\n3. **Compare the Numbers**: \n   - Start by comparing the whole number part (before the decimal point):\n     - 16764659\n     - 16764668\n     - 16764666\n     - 16764650\n     - 16764665\n\n4. **Identify the Smallest Whole Number**: \n   - The smallest whole number is 16764650.\n\n5. **Verify the Decimal Part**: \n   - Since 16764650 is already the smallest whole number, we don't need to compare the decimal parts further for this number.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: \n   - The smallest number among the given options is 16764650.741.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number is <<<16764650.741>>>."
