    "To solve this problem, we need to compare the given numbers and identify the smallest one. Let's analyze each number step by step:\n\n1. **First Number: 405663402.990000**\n   - This number is written in standard decimal notation.\n   - It is 405,663,402.99.\n\n2. **Second Number: 405,663,400.27**\n   - This number is also in standard decimal notation.\n   - It is 405,663,400.27.\n\n3. **Third Number: 4.056634026540000e+08**\n   - This number is written in scientific notation.\n   - The \"e+08\" indicates that the decimal point should be moved 8 places to the right.\n   - Converting this to standard decimal notation: 4.056634026540000 * 10^8 = 405,663,402.654.\n\nNow, let's compare these numbers:\n\n- 405,663,402.99\n- 405,663,400.27\n- 405,663,402.654\n\nTo find the smallest number, we compare them:\n\n- 405,663,400.27 is less than 405,663,402.654.\n- 405,663,400.27 is also less than 405,663,402.99.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number among the given options is 405,663,400.27.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<405663400.27>>>"
