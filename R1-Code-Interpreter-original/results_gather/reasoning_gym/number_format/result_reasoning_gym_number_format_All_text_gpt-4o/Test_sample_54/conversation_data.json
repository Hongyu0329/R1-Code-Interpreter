    "To determine the largest number from the given options, we need to compare the two numbers provided:\n\n1. **Scientific Notation**: The first number is given in scientific notation: \\(5.562007978820000 \\times 10^8\\). This means the number is \\(5.562007978820000\\) multiplied by \\(10^8\\), which is equivalent to moving the decimal point 8 places to the right. Therefore, the number is \\(556,200,797.882\\).\n\n2. **Standard Notation**: The second number is given in standard decimal notation: \\(556,200,807.715\\).\n\nNow, let's compare the two numbers:\n\n- The first number in standard form is \\(556,200,797.882\\).\n- The second number is \\(556,200,807.715\\).\n\nTo compare these numbers, we look at each digit from left to right:\n\n- Both numbers have the same digits up to the hundred millions place (5), ten millions place (5), millions place (6), hundred thousands place (2), ten thousands place (0), thousands place (0), and hundreds place (7).\n- The first number has a digit of 9 in the tens place, while the second number has a digit of 8 in the tens place.\n\nSince 9 is less than 8, the second number, \\(556,200,807.715\\), is larger than the first number, \\(556,200,797.882\\).\n\nTherefore, the largest number is:\n\n<<<556200807.715>>>"
