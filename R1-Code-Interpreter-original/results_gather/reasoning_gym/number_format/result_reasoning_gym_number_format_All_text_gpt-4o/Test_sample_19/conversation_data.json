    "To determine the smallest number among the given candidates, we need to carefully analyze each number and compare them. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Numbers:**\n   - The first number is given in standard decimal notation: 838490509.835000.\n   - The second number is given in scientific notation: 8.384905108810000e+08, which means 8.384905108810000 Ã— 10^8.\n   - The third number is given with commas for readability: 838,490,504.7570001, which is equivalent to 838490504.7570001.\n\n2. **Convert Scientific Notation:**\n   - Convert the scientific notation to standard decimal form:\n     - 8.384905108810000e+08 = 838,490,510.8810000\n\n3. **Compare the Numbers:**\n   - Now, we have the following numbers to compare:\n     - 838490509.835000\n     - 838490510.8810000\n     - 838490504.7570001\n\n4. **Identify the Smallest Number:**\n   - Compare the numbers digit by digit from left to right:\n     - The first number is 838,490,509.835000\n     - The second number is 838,490,510.8810000\n     - The third number is 838,490,504.7570001\n\n   - The third number, 838,490,504.7570001, is the smallest because:\n     - The first three digits (838) are the same for all numbers.\n     - The next three digits (490) are the same for all numbers.\n     - The next three digits (504) in the third number are smaller than 509 in the first number and 510 in the second number.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The smallest number among the given candidates is 838,490,504.7570001.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number is:\n\n<<<838490504.7570001>>>"
