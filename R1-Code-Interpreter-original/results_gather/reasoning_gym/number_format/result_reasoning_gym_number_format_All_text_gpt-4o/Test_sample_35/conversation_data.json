    "To determine the smallest number from the given candidates, we need to carefully compare the numbers step by step. Here are the steps to follow:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers given are:\n   - 116,094,204.798\n   - 116,094,202.96599999\n\n2. **Compare the Whole Numbers**: \n   - The whole number part of the first candidate is 116,094,204.\n   - The whole number part of the second candidate is 116,094,202.\n\n3. **Determine the Smaller Whole Number**:\n   - Compare 116,094,204 and 116,094,202.\n   - Clearly, 116,094,202 is smaller than 116,094,204.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the whole number part of the second candidate is smaller, we do not need to compare the decimal parts.\n   - Therefore, the smallest number is 116,094,202.96599999.\n\nThe smallest number is <<<116,094,202.96599999>>>."
