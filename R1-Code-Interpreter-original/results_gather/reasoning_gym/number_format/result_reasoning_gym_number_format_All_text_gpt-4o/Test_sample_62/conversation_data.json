    "To determine the smallest number among the given candidates, we need to carefully analyze each number and compare them. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers:**\n   - The first number is given in standard decimal form: 124119776.357000\n   - The second number is given in scientific notation: 1.241197719590000e+08\n   - The third number is given in a comma-separated format: 124,119,774.97099999\n\n2. **Convert Scientific Notation:**\n   - The second number, 1.241197719590000e+08, is in scientific notation. This means it is 1.241197719590000 Ã— 10^8, which equals 124119771.959.\n\n3. **Remove Commas:**\n   - The third number, 124,119,774.97099999, is written with commas for readability. Removing the commas gives us 124119774.97099999.\n\n4. **Compare the Numbers:**\n   - Now we have the following numbers to compare:\n     - 124119776.357000\n     - 124119771.959\n     - 124119774.97099999\n\n5. **Determine the Smallest Number:**\n   - Compare the numbers:\n     - 124119771.959 is less than 124119774.97099999\n     - 124119771.959 is also less than 124119776.357000\n\n   Therefore, the smallest number among the candidates is 124119771.959.\n\nThe smallest number is: <<<124119771.959>>>"
