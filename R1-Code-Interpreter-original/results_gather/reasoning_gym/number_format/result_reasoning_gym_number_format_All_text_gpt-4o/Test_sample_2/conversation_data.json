    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the smallest number from the given list of candidates. Let's analyze each number step by step:\n\n1. **First Number: 585,747,269.003**\n   - This number is written with commas for readability. It is equivalent to 585747269.003 when the commas are removed.\n\n2. **Second Number: 585747275.870000**\n   - This number is already in a format without commas and has six decimal places.\n\n3. **Third Number: 585,747,276.9760001**\n   - This number, when commas are removed, is 585747276.9760001.\n\n4. **Fourth Number: 585,747,276.6470001**\n   - This number, when commas are removed, is 585747276.6470001.\n\nNow, let's compare these numbers:\n\n- 585747269.003\n- 585747275.870000\n- 585747276.9760001\n- 585747276.6470001\n\nTo find the smallest number, we compare the integer parts first:\n\n- The integer part of the first number is 585747269.\n- The integer part of the second number is 585747275.\n- The integer part of the third number is 585747276.\n- The integer part of the fourth number is 585747276.\n\nThe smallest integer part is 585747269, which corresponds to the first number, 585747269.003.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number among the given candidates is 585747269.003.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<585747269.003>>>"
