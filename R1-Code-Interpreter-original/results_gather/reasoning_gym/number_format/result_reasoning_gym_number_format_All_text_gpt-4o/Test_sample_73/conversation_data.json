    "To determine the smallest number from the given options, we need to carefully analyze each number and compare them. Let's break down the numbers:\n\n1. **5.807229881380000e+08**: This is in scientific notation, which means \\(5.807229881380000 \\times 10^8\\). Converting this to a standard decimal form, it becomes 580,722,988.138.\n\n2. **580,722,980.307**: This is already in decimal form.\n\n3. **580,722,978.178**: This is also in decimal form.\n\n4. **580722988.619000**: This is in decimal form without commas, equivalent to 580,722,988.619.\n\nNow, let's compare these numbers:\n\n- 580,722,988.138 (from scientific notation)\n- 580,722,980.307\n- 580,722,978.178\n- 580,722,988.619\n\nTo find the smallest number, we compare them:\n\n- 580,722,978.178 is less than 580,722,980.307.\n- 580,722,978.178 is less than 580,722,988.138.\n- 580,722,978.178 is less than 580,722,988.619.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number among the given options is 580,722,978.178.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<580,722,978.178>>>"
