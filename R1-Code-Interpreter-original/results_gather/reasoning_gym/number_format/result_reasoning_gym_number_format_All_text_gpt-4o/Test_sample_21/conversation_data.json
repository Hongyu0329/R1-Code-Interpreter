    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the smallest number among the given candidates. Let's analyze each number step by step:\n\n1. **Scientific Notation Conversion**:\n   - The first number is given in scientific notation: \\(4.564877633090000 \\times 10^8\\).\n   - The third number is also in scientific notation: \\(4.564877720490000 \\times 10^8\\).\n\n2. **Standard Notation**:\n   - Convert the scientific notation numbers to standard form:\n     - \\(4.564877633090000 \\times 10^8 = 456,487,763.309\\)\n     - \\(4.564877720490000 \\times 10^8 = 456,487,772.049\\)\n\n3. **Comparison**:\n   - Now, compare the numbers in standard form:\n     - 456,487,763.309\n     - 456,487,767.537\n     - 456,487,772.049\n\n4. **Identify the Smallest Number**:\n   - Among the numbers 456,487,763.309, 456,487,767.537, and 456,487,772.049, the smallest number is 456,487,763.309.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number among the given candidates is:\n\n<<<456487763.309>>>"
