    "To determine the largest number from the given candidates, we need to compare the two numbers provided:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers**: \n   - The first number is 25011730.212000.\n   - The second number is 25011725.713000.\n\n2. **Compare the whole numbers**:\n   - The whole number part of the first number is 25011730.\n   - The whole number part of the second number is 25011725.\n\n3. **Determine which whole number is larger**:\n   - 25011730 is greater than 25011725.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the whole number part of the first number is larger than that of the second number, the first number is the largest.\n\nTherefore, the largest number is 25011730.212000.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<25011730.212000>>>."
