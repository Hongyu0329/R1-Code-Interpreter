    "To determine the largest number from the given options, we need to carefully analyze each number and compare them. Here are the steps to follow:\n\n1. **Understand the Notation**: \n   - The first number is given in scientific notation: \\(9.878832144809999 \\times 10^8\\).\n   - The second number is given in standard decimal notation: 987,883,208.4059999.\n\n2. **Convert Scientific Notation to Decimal**:\n   - The scientific notation \\(9.878832144809999 \\times 10^8\\) can be converted to decimal form by moving the decimal point 8 places to the right. This results in 987,883,214.4809999.\n\n3. **Compare the Numbers**:\n   - Now we have two numbers in decimal form:\n     - 987,883,214.4809999\n     - 987,883,208.4059999\n   - Compare these two numbers digit by digit from left to right:\n     - The first number has 987,883,214 while the second has 987,883,208.\n     - Clearly, 987,883,214 is greater than 987,883,208.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The largest number between the two is 987,883,214.4809999.\n\nTherefore, the largest number is:\n\n<<<987883214.4809999>>>"
