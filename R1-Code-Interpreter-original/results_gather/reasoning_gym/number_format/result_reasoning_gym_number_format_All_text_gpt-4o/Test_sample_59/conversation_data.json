    "To solve this problem, we need to compare two numbers and determine which one is the smallest. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Notation**: \n   - The first number is given in scientific notation: \\(5.906106242520000 \\times 10^8\\).\n   - The second number is given in standard decimal notation: 590610633.602000.\n\n2. **Convert Scientific Notation to Decimal**:\n   - The scientific notation \\(5.906106242520000 \\times 10^8\\) means we need to move the decimal point 8 places to the right.\n   - This results in the number: 590610624.252000.\n\n3. **Compare the Two Numbers**:\n   - The first number in decimal form is 590610624.252000.\n   - The second number is 590610633.602000.\n\n4. **Determine the Smallest Number**:\n   - Compare the two numbers:\n     - 590610624.252000\n     - 590610633.602000\n   - Clearly, 590610624.252000 is smaller than 590610633.602000.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The smallest number between the two is 590610624.252000.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number is:\n\n<<<590610624.252000>>>"
