    "To determine the smallest number from the given candidates, we need to carefully compare each number. Let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **List the Numbers**: \n   - 8,730,961.374\n   - 8,730,964.299000\n   - 8,730,966.126\n   - 8,730,960.988\n\n2. **Compare the Whole Numbers**:\n   - The whole number part of each candidate is:\n     - 8,730,961\n     - 8,730,964\n     - 8,730,966\n     - 8,730,960\n\n3. **Identify the Smallest Whole Number**:\n   - Among the whole numbers, 8,730,960 is the smallest.\n\n4. **Verify the Smallest Number**:\n   - The number with the smallest whole number part is 8,730,960.988.\n   - Since the whole number part is the smallest, we don't need to compare the decimal parts further.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The smallest number among the given candidates is 8,730,960.988.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number is:\n\n<<<8,730,960.988>>>"
