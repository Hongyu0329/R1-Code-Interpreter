    "To determine the largest number from the given options, we need to carefully analyze each number and compare them. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Notation**:\n   - The first number is given in scientific notation: \\(4.736724145390000 \\times 10^8\\).\n   - The second number is given in standard decimal notation: 473,672,415.005.\n\n2. **Convert Scientific Notation to Standard Form**:\n   - The scientific notation \\(4.736724145390000 \\times 10^8\\) means we need to move the decimal point 8 places to the right.\n   - This results in the number: 473,672,414.539.\n\n3. **Compare the Numbers**:\n   - Now we have two numbers to compare:\n     - 473,672,414.539 (from the scientific notation)\n     - 473,672,415.005 (given in standard form)\n   - Compare these two numbers digit by digit from left to right:\n     - Both numbers have the same digits up to the decimal point.\n     - After the decimal point, the first number has 539, while the second number has 005.\n\n4. **Determine the Larger Number**:\n   - Since 005 is greater than 539, the number 473,672,415.005 is larger than 473,672,414.539.\n\nTherefore, the largest number among the given options is:\n\n<<<473672415.005>>>"
