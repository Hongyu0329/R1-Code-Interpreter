    "To determine the smallest number from the given options, we need to carefully compare the numbers step by step. Here are the steps to follow:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: The numbers provided are:\n   - 311,987,137.632\n   - 311,987,146.10800004\n\n2. **Compare the Whole Numbers**: \n   - The whole number part of the first number is 311,987,137.\n   - The whole number part of the second number is 311,987,146.\n\n3. **Determine the Smaller Whole Number**:\n   - Compare 311,987,137 with 311,987,146.\n   - Since 311,987,137 is less than 311,987,146, the first number is smaller.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the whole number part of the first number is smaller, there is no need to compare the decimal parts.\n   - Therefore, the smallest number is 311,987,137.632.\n\nThe smallest number is <<<311,987,137.632>>>."
