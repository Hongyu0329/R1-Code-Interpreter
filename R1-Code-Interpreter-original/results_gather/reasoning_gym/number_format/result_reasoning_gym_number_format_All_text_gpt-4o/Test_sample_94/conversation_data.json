    "To determine the smallest number from the given options, we need to compare the two numbers provided:\n\n1. **Scientific Notation**: The first number is given in scientific notation: \\(5.780643167110000 \\times 10^8\\). This means the number is \\(578,064,316.711\\).\n\n2. **Decimal Notation**: The second number is given in decimal notation: \\(578,064,315.838\\).\n\nNow, let's compare these two numbers:\n\n- **578,064,316.711** (from scientific notation)\n- **578,064,315.838** (from decimal notation)\n\nTo find the smallest number, we compare the two:\n\n- The first number is \\(578,064,316.711\\).\n- The second number is \\(578,064,315.838\\).\n\nSince \\(578,064,315.838\\) is less than \\(578,064,316.711\\), the smallest number is \\(578,064,315.838\\).\n\nTherefore, the smallest number is:\n\n<<<578064315.838>>>"
