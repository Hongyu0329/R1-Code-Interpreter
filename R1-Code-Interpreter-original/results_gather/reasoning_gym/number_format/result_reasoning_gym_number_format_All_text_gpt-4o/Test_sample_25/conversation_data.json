    "To solve this problem, we need to compare two numbers and determine which one is the smallest. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: We have two numbers to compare:\n   - The first number is given in standard decimal notation: 367752845.947000\n   - The second number is given in scientific notation: 3.677528480530000e+08\n\n2. **Convert Scientific Notation to Decimal**: \n   - The scientific notation 3.677528480530000e+08 means 3.677528480530000 Ã— 10^8.\n   - To convert this to decimal form, move the decimal point 8 places to the right: 367,752,848.053000\n\n3. **Compare the Numbers**:\n   - The first number in decimal form is 367,752,845.947000.\n   - The second number in decimal form is 367,752,848.053000.\n\n4. **Determine the Smallest Number**:\n   - Compare the two numbers: 367,752,845.947000 and 367,752,848.053000.\n   - The first number, 367,752,845.947000, is smaller than the second number, 367,752,848.053000.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The smallest number between the two is 367,752,845.947000.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number is:\n\n<<<367752845.947000>>>"
