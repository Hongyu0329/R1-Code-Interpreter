    "To determine the largest number from the given options, we need to carefully analyze each number and compare them. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Numbers**: \n   - The first number is 65,155,211.415.\n   - The second number is in scientific notation: 6.515521771100000e+07.\n   - The third number is 65,155,219.264.\n\n2. **Convert Scientific Notation**:\n   - The number 6.515521771100000e+07 is in scientific notation, which means it is 6.515521771100000 Ã— 10^7.\n   - To convert this to a standard decimal form, move the decimal point 7 places to the right: 65,155,217.711.\n\n3. **Compare the Numbers**:\n   - Now we have three numbers in standard form:\n     - 65,155,211.415\n     - 65,155,217.711\n     - 65,155,219.264\n\n4. **Determine the Largest Number**:\n   - Compare the numbers digit by digit from left to right:\n     - All numbers have the same digits up to the hundred-thousands place (65,155,2xx.xxx).\n     - Compare the digits after the decimal point:\n       - 65,155,211.415 has 211 after the decimal.\n       - 65,155,217.711 has 217 after the decimal.\n       - 65,155,219.264 has 219 after the decimal.\n   - Clearly, 65,155,219.264 is the largest number as 219 is greater than 217 and 211.\n\nTherefore, the largest number among the given options is:\n\n<<<65,155,219.264>>>"
