    "To find the smallest number among the given candidates, we need to carefully analyze each number and compare them. Let's break down the numbers:\n\n1. **7.946487768250000e+08**: This is in scientific notation, which means \\(7.946487768250000 \\times 10^8\\). Converting it to a standard form gives us 794,648,776.825.\n\n2. **794648778.828000**: This is already in standard form, and it is 794,648,778.828.\n\n3. **7.946487750540000e+08**: This is in scientific notation, which means \\(7.946487750540000 \\times 10^8\\). Converting it to a standard form gives us 794,648,775.054.\n\n4. **794,648,781.095**: This is already in standard form, and it is 794,648,781.095.\n\n5. **7.946487795870000e+08**: This is in scientific notation, which means \\(7.946487795870000 \\times 10^8\\). Converting it to a standard form gives us 794,648,779.587.\n\nNow, let's list the numbers in standard form for easy comparison:\n\n- 794,648,776.825\n- 794,648,778.828\n- 794,648,775.054\n- 794,648,781.095\n- 794,648,779.587\n\nNext, we compare these numbers to find the smallest one:\n\n- 794,648,775.054 is the smallest number among the given options.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number is:\n\n<<<794648775.054>>>"
