    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the original number to base 10**: This involves interpreting the number in its original base and calculating its equivalent in base 10.\n\n2. **Convert the base 10 number to the target base**: Once we have the base 10 equivalent, we can convert it to the desired base by repeatedly dividing the number by the target base and recording the remainders.\n\nLet's apply these steps to convert the base-8 number 426 to base-9.\n\n### Step 1: Convert base-8 number 426 to base-10\n\nThe base-8 number 426 can be expanded as:\n\\[ 4 \\times 8^2 + 2 \\times 8^1 + 6 \\times 8^0 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Convert the base-10 number to base-9\n\nOnce we have the base-10 equivalent, we will convert it to base-9 by dividing by 9 and recording the remainders.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-8 number 426 to base-10\nbase_8_number = '426'\nbase_10_number = int(base_8_number, 8)\n\n# Step 2: Convert the base-10 number to base-9\ndef convert_to_base_n(number, base):\n    if number == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while number:\n        digits.append(int(number % base))\n        number //= base\n    return ''.join(str(x) for x in digits[::-1])\n\nbase_9_number = convert_to_base_n(base_10_number, 9)\nprint(base_9_number)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the base-9 equivalent of the base-8 number 426.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the base-9 equivalent of the base-8 number 426 is 338. This result is consistent with the expected conversion process.\n\nTo summarize the conversion:\n\n1. **Convert base-8 number 426 to base-10**:\n   - \\(4 \\times 8^2 + 2 \\times 8^1 + 6 \\times 8^0 = 256 + 16 + 6 = 278\\)\n\n2. **Convert base-10 number 278 to base-9**:\n   - Divide 278 by 9, quotient is 30, remainder is 8\n   - Divide 30 by 9, quotient is 3, remainder is 3\n   - Divide 3 by 9, quotient is 0, remainder is 3\n\n   Reading the remainders from last to first gives us 338 in base-9.\n\nTherefore, the base-9 equivalent of the base-8 number 426 is 338.\n\n<<<answer>>>338<<<answer>>>"
