    "To convert a number from base-10 to another base, we can use the method of successive division by the target base and collecting the remainders. These remainders represent the digits of the number in the new base, starting from the least significant digit (rightmost) to the most significant digit (leftmost).\n\nLet's apply this method to convert the base-10 number 331 to base-11:\n\n1. Divide the number by the target base (11) and record the remainder.\n2. Update the number to the quotient of the division.\n3. Repeat the process until the quotient is zero.\n4. The base-11 number is the sequence of remainders read in reverse order.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\ndef convert_base_10_to_base_n(number, base):\n    if number == 0:\n        return \"0\"\n    \n    digits = []\n    while number:\n        remainder = number % base\n        if remainder >= 10:\n            # Convert remainder to corresponding letter for bases > 10\n            digits.append(chr(remainder - 10 + ord('a')))\n        else:\n            digits.append(str(remainder))\n        number //= base\n    \n    # The digits are collected in reverse order\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\n# Convert 331 from base-10 to base-11\nresult = convert_base_10_to_base_n(331, 11)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the base-11 representation of the number 331.",
    "The code executed correctly and returned the base-11 representation of the base-10 number 331 as \"281\". This result is consistent with the expected conversion process.\n\nTo verify, let's break down the conversion:\n\n1. 331 divided by 11 gives a quotient of 30 and a remainder of 1.\n2. 30 divided by 11 gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 8.\n3. 2 divided by 11 gives a quotient of 0 and a remainder of 2.\n\nReading the remainders from last to first, we get \"281\" in base-11.\n\nSince the code execution and the manual verification both confirm the result, we can confidently provide the final answer.\n\n<<<'281'>>>"
