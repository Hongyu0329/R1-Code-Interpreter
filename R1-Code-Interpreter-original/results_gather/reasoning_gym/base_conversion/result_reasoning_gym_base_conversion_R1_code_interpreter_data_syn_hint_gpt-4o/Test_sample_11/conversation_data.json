    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the number from the original base to base 10 (decimal):**\n   - The base-6 number 103 can be expanded as:\n     \\[\n     1 \\times 6^2 + 0 \\times 6^1 + 3 \\times 6^0\n     \\]\n   - Calculate the decimal equivalent.\n\n2. **Convert the decimal number to the target base (base-13 in this case):**\n   - Divide the decimal number by the target base (13) and keep track of the remainders.\n   - The remainders, read in reverse order, will give the digits of the number in the target base.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-6 number 103 to decimal\nbase_6_number = \"103\"\ndecimal_number = 0\nbase_6_number_reversed = base_6_number[::-1]\n\nfor i, digit in enumerate(base_6_number_reversed):\n    decimal_number += int(digit) * (6 ** i)\n\n# Step 2: Convert the decimal number to base-13\nbase_13_number = \"\"\ncurrent_number = decimal_number\n\nwhile current_number > 0:\n    remainder = current_number % 13\n    if remainder >= 10:\n        # Convert remainder to corresponding letter for base > 10\n        base_13_number = chr(remainder - 10 + ord('a')) + base_13_number\n    else:\n        base_13_number = str(remainder) + base_13_number\n    current_number //= 13\n\nprint(base_13_number)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the base-13 equivalent of the base-6 number 103.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the base-6 number 103 is converted to 30 in base-13. This result is correct based on the conversion process. Let's verify the steps:\n\n1. **Convert base-6 number 103 to decimal:**\n   - \\(1 \\times 6^2 + 0 \\times 6^1 + 3 \\times 6^0 = 36 + 0 + 3 = 39\\)\n\n2. **Convert the decimal number 39 to base-13:**\n   - Divide 39 by 13, which gives a quotient of 3 and a remainder of 0.\n   - The base-13 representation is therefore \"30\".\n\nThe conversion process and the result are correct. Therefore, the base-13 equivalent of the base-6 number 103 is indeed \"30\".\n\n<<<'30'>>>"
