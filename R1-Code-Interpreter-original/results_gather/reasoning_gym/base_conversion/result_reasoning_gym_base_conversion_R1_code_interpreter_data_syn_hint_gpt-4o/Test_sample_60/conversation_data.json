    "To convert a base-10 number to another base, we can use the method of successive division by the target base and keeping track of the remainders. These remainders represent the digits of the number in the new base, starting from the least significant digit (rightmost) to the most significant digit (leftmost).\n\nLet's break down the conversion of the base-10 number 431 to base-11:\n\n1. Divide 431 by 11, which gives a quotient and a remainder.\n2. The remainder is the least significant digit in base-11.\n3. Use the quotient from the previous division as the new number to divide by 11.\n4. Repeat the process until the quotient is zero.\n5. The remainders collected in reverse order give the number in base-11.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\ndef convert_base_10_to_base_n(number, base):\n    if number == 0:\n        return \"0\"\n    \n    digits = []\n    while number:\n        digits.append(int(number % base))\n        number //= base\n    \n    # Convert digits to appropriate base-n representation\n    base_n_number = ''.join(str(d) if d < 10 else chr(d - 10 + ord('a')) for d in reversed(digits))\n    return base_n_number\n\n# Convert 431 from base-10 to base-11\nresult = convert_base_10_to_base_n(431, 11)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will convert the number 431 from base-10 to base-11 and print the result. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the conversion of the base-10 number 431 to base-11 is 362. This result is consistent with the expected outcome based on the conversion process.\n\nTo verify, let's break down the conversion manually:\n\n1. Divide 431 by 11:\n   - Quotient: 39, Remainder: 2\n2. Divide 39 by 11:\n   - Quotient: 3, Remainder: 6\n3. Divide 3 by 11:\n   - Quotient: 0, Remainder: 3\n\nReading the remainders from bottom to top gives us the base-11 number: 362.\n\nTherefore, the conversion is correct, and the final answer is:\n\n<<<'362'>>>"
