    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the number from the original base to base 10 (decimal):**\n   - Each digit in the number is multiplied by the base raised to the power of the position index (starting from 0 on the right).\n   - Sum all these values to get the decimal equivalent.\n\n2. **Convert the decimal number to the target base:**\n   - Divide the decimal number by the target base and keep track of the remainders.\n   - The remainders, read in reverse order, give the digits of the number in the target base.\n\nLet's apply these steps to convert the base-15 number `442` to base-5.\n\n### Step 1: Convert from base-15 to base-10\n\nThe number `442` in base-15 can be expanded as:\n\\[ 4 \\times 15^2 + 4 \\times 15^1 + 2 \\times 15^0 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Convert from base-10 to base-5\n\nOnce we have the decimal equivalent, we will convert it to base-5 by repeatedly dividing by 5 and recording the remainders.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-15 to base-10\nbase_15_number = '442'\nbase_15 = 15\n\n# Convert to decimal\ndecimal_number = 0\nfor i, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_15_number)):\n    decimal_number += int(digit, base_15) * (base_15 ** i)\n\n# Step 2: Convert base-10 to base-5\nbase_5 = 5\nbase_5_number = ''\n\nwhile decimal_number > 0:\n    remainder = decimal_number % base_5\n    base_5_number = str(remainder) + base_5_number\n    decimal_number //= base_5\n\nprint(base_5_number)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the base-5 equivalent of the base-15 number `442`.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the conversion from base-15 to base-5 was successful, and the base-5 equivalent of the base-15 number `442` is `12322`.\n\nLet's verify the steps to ensure the conversion is correct:\n\n1. **Convert from base-15 to base-10:**\n   - The base-15 number `442` is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     4 \\times 15^2 + 4 \\times 15^1 + 2 \\times 15^0 = 4 \\times 225 + 4 \\times 15 + 2 \\times 1 = 900 + 60 + 2 = 962\n     \\]\n\n2. **Convert from base-10 to base-5:**\n   - Convert `962` to base-5:\n     - \\(962 \\div 5 = 192\\) remainder \\(2\\)\n     - \\(192 \\div 5 = 38\\) remainder \\(2\\)\n     - \\(38 \\div 5 = 7\\) remainder \\(3\\)\n     - \\(7 \\div 5 = 1\\) remainder \\(2\\)\n     - \\(1 \\div 5 = 0\\) remainder \\(1\\)\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top gives us `12322` in base-5.\n\nThe conversion process and the result are correct. Therefore, the base-5 equivalent of the base-15 number `442` is indeed `12322`.\n\n<<<answer>>>12322<<<answer>>>"
