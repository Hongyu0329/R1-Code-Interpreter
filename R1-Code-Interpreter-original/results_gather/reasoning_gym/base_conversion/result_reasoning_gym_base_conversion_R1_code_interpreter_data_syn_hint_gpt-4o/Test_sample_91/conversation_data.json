    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the number from the original base to base-10 (decimal):**\n   - For a base-6 number like 125, we interpret it as \\(1 \\times 6^2 + 2 \\times 6^1 + 5 \\times 6^0\\).\n\n2. **Convert the base-10 number to the target base (base-3 in this case):**\n   - We repeatedly divide the base-10 number by the target base (3) and keep track of the remainders. The remainders, read in reverse order, give us the number in the target base.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-6 number 125 to base-10\nbase_6_number = \"125\"\nbase_10_number = int(base_6_number, 6)\n\n# Step 2: Convert base-10 number to base-3\ndef convert_to_base_3(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return \"0\"\n    digits = []\n    while n:\n        digits.append(int(n % 3))\n        n //= 3\n    return ''.join(str(x) for x in digits[::-1])\n\nbase_3_number = convert_to_base_3(base_10_number)\nprint(base_3_number)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the base-3 equivalent of the base-6 number 125.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output `1222`, which is the base-3 representation of the base-6 number `125`. \n\nTo ensure the correctness of the conversion, let's verify the steps:\n\n1. **Convert base-6 number 125 to base-10:**\n   - \\(1 \\times 6^2 + 2 \\times 6^1 + 5 \\times 6^0 = 1 \\times 36 + 2 \\times 6 + 5 \\times 1 = 36 + 12 + 5 = 53\\).\n\n2. **Convert base-10 number 53 to base-3:**\n   - Divide 53 by 3: quotient = 17, remainder = 2\n   - Divide 17 by 3: quotient = 5, remainder = 2\n   - Divide 5 by 3: quotient = 1, remainder = 2\n   - Divide 1 by 3: quotient = 0, remainder = 1\n   - Reading the remainders from last to first gives us 1222 in base-3.\n\nThe conversion process is correct, and the base-3 representation of the base-6 number 125 is indeed `1222`.\n\n<<<'1222'>>>"
