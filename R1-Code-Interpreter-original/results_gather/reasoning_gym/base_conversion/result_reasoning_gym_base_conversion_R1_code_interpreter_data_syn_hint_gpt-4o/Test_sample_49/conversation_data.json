    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the number from the original base to base-10 (decimal):**\n   - Each digit in the number is multiplied by the base raised to the power of the position index (starting from 0 on the right).\n   - Sum all these values to get the decimal equivalent.\n\n2. **Convert the decimal number to the target base:**\n   - Divide the decimal number by the target base and keep track of the remainders.\n   - The remainders, read in reverse order, give the digits of the number in the target base.\n\nLet's apply this to convert the base-15 number \"248\" to base-9.\n\n### Step 1: Convert from base-15 to base-10\n\nThe number \"248\" in base-15 can be broken down as:\n- \\(2 \\times 15^2 + 4 \\times 15^1 + 8 \\times 15^0\\)\n\n### Step 2: Convert from base-10 to base-9\n\nOnce we have the decimal equivalent, we will convert it to base-9 by dividing by 9 and recording the remainders.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the result.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert from base-15 to base-10\nbase_15_number = \"248\"\nbase_15 = 15\n\n# Convert base-15 number to decimal\ndecimal_number = 0\nfor index, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_15_number)):\n    decimal_number += int(digit) * (base_15 ** index)\n\n# Step 2: Convert from decimal to base-9\nbase_9 = 9\nbase_9_number = \"\"\n\nwhile decimal_number > 0:\n    remainder = decimal_number % base_9\n    base_9_number = str(remainder) + base_9_number\n    decimal_number //= base_9\n\nprint(base_9_number)\n```\n\nThis code will output the base-9 equivalent of the base-15 number \"248\".",
    "The code execution result indicates that the conversion from base-15 to base-9 was successful, and the base-9 equivalent of the base-15 number \"248\" is \"635\". \n\nLet's verify the steps to ensure the conversion is correct:\n\n1. **Convert from base-15 to base-10:**\n   - The base-15 number \"248\" is calculated as:\n     - \\(2 \\times 15^2 = 2 \\times 225 = 450\\)\n     - \\(4 \\times 15^1 = 4 \\times 15 = 60\\)\n     - \\(8 \\times 15^0 = 8 \\times 1 = 8\\)\n   - Sum: \\(450 + 60 + 8 = 518\\)\n\n2. **Convert from base-10 to base-9:**\n   - Divide 518 by 9:\n     - 518 รท 9 = 57 remainder 5\n     - 57 รท 9 = 6 remainder 3\n     - 6 รท 9 = 0 remainder 6\n   - Reading the remainders from last to first gives us \"635\".\n\nThe conversion process and the result are correct. Therefore, the base-9 equivalent of the base-15 number \"248\" is indeed \"635\".\n\n<<<'635'>>>"
