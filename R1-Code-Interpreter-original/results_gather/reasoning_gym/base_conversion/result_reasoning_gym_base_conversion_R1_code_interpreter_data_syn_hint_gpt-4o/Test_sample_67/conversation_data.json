    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the original number to base-10 (decimal):** \n   - Start with the least significant digit (rightmost) and move to the most significant digit (leftmost).\n   - Multiply each digit by the base raised to the power of its position index (starting from 0).\n   - Sum all these values to get the decimal equivalent.\n\n2. **Convert the base-10 number to the target base:**\n   - Divide the decimal number by the target base and record the remainder.\n   - Update the decimal number to the quotient of the division.\n   - Repeat the process until the quotient is zero.\n   - The remainders, read in reverse order, give the number in the target base.\n\nLet's apply this to convert the base-8 number 635 to base-5.\n\n### Step 1: Convert base-8 number 635 to base-10\n\nThe base-8 number 635 can be expanded as:\n\\[ 6 \\times 8^2 + 3 \\times 8^1 + 5 \\times 8^0 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Convert the resulting base-10 number to base-5\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Convert base-8 number 635 to base-10\nbase_8_number = '635'\nbase_10_number = sum(int(digit) * (8 ** idx) for idx, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_8_number)))\n\n# Convert base-10 number to base-5\nbase_5_number = ''\nwhile base_10_number > 0:\n    base_5_number = str(base_10_number % 5) + base_5_number\n    base_10_number //= 5\n\nprint(base_5_number)\n```\n\nThis script will output the base-5 equivalent of the base-8 number 635.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the conversion process was successful, and the base-5 equivalent of the base-8 number 635 is 3123. \n\nLet's verify the steps to ensure the conversion is correct:\n\n1. **Convert base-8 number 635 to base-10:**\n   - \\(6 \\times 8^2 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\)\n   - \\(3 \\times 8^1 = 3 \\times 8 = 24\\)\n   - \\(5 \\times 8^0 = 5 \\times 1 = 5\\)\n   - Sum: \\(384 + 24 + 5 = 413\\)\n\n2. **Convert base-10 number 413 to base-5:**\n   - \\(413 \\div 5 = 82\\) remainder \\(3\\)\n   - \\(82 \\div 5 = 16\\) remainder \\(2\\)\n   - \\(16 \\div 5 = 3\\) remainder \\(1\\)\n   - \\(3 \\div 5 = 0\\) remainder \\(3\\)\n\nReading the remainders from bottom to top gives us 3123 in base-5.\n\nThe conversion process and the result are correct. Therefore, the base-5 equivalent of the base-8 number 635 is indeed 3123.\n\n<<<'3123'>>>"
