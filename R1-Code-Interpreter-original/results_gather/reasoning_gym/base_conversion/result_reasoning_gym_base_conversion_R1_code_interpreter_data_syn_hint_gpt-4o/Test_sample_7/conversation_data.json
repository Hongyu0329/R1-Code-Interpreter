    "To convert a number from base-6 to base-8, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the base-6 number to a decimal (base-10) number.**\n   - Each digit in the base-6 number represents a power of 6. \n   - For the number 554 in base-6, the conversion to decimal is calculated as follows:\n     - \\(5 \\times 6^2 + 5 \\times 6^1 + 4 \\times 6^0\\)\n\n2. **Convert the decimal number to base-8.**\n   - Divide the decimal number by 8 and keep track of the remainders.\n   - The base-8 number is formed by the remainders, read from bottom to top.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-6 number 554 to decimal\nbase_6_number = '554'\ndecimal_number = sum(int(digit) * (6 ** idx) for idx, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_6_number)))\n\n# Step 2: Convert the decimal number to base-8\nbase_8_number = ''\nwhile decimal_number > 0:\n    remainder = decimal_number % 8\n    base_8_number = str(remainder) + base_8_number\n    decimal_number //= 8\n\nprint(base_8_number)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the base-8 equivalent of the base-6 number 554.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the conversion from base-6 to base-8 was successful, and the base-8 equivalent of the base-6 number 554 is 326.\n\nTo ensure the correctness of the conversion, let's verify the steps:\n\n1. **Convert 554 from base-6 to decimal:**\n   - \\(5 \\times 6^2 = 5 \\times 36 = 180\\)\n   - \\(5 \\times 6^1 = 5 \\times 6 = 30\\)\n   - \\(4 \\times 6^0 = 4 \\times 1 = 4\\)\n   - Total in decimal = 180 + 30 + 4 = 214\n\n2. **Convert 214 from decimal to base-8:**\n   - 214 divided by 8 gives a quotient of 26 and a remainder of 6.\n   - 26 divided by 8 gives a quotient of 3 and a remainder of 2.\n   - 3 divided by 8 gives a quotient of 0 and a remainder of 3.\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top gives 326 in base-8.\n\nThe conversion process and the result are correct. Therefore, the base-8 equivalent of the base-6 number 554 is indeed 326.\n\n<<<'326'>>>"
