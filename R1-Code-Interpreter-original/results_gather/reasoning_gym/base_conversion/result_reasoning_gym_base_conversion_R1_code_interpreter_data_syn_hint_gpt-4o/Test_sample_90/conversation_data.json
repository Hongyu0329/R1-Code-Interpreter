    "To convert a number from base-5 to base-11, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the base-5 number to a decimal (base-10) number.**\n   - The base-5 number 4042 can be expanded as:\n     \\[\n     4 \\times 5^3 + 0 \\times 5^2 + 4 \\times 5^1 + 2 \\times 5^0\n     \\]\n\n2. **Convert the decimal number to base-11.**\n   - Once we have the decimal equivalent, we can convert it to base-11 by repeatedly dividing the number by 11 and recording the remainders.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-5 to decimal\nbase_5_number = '4042'\ndecimal_number = sum(int(digit) * (5 ** idx) for idx, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_5_number)))\n\n# Step 2: Convert decimal to base-11\nbase_11_number = ''\nwhile decimal_number > 0:\n    remainder = decimal_number % 11\n    # Convert remainder to appropriate base-11 digit\n    if remainder >= 10:\n        base_11_digit = chr(remainder - 10 + ord('a'))\n    else:\n        base_11_digit = str(remainder)\n    base_11_number = base_11_digit + base_11_number\n    decimal_number //= 11\n\nprint(base_11_number)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the base-11 equivalent of the base-5 number 4042.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the base-5 number 4042 has been successfully converted to the base-11 number 435. This result is consistent with the expected conversion process.\n\nTo ensure the accuracy of the conversion, let's briefly review the steps:\n\n1. **Convert base-5 to decimal:**\n   - \\(4 \\times 5^3 + 0 \\times 5^2 + 4 \\times 5^1 + 2 \\times 5^0 = 500 + 0 + 20 + 2 = 522\\)\n\n2. **Convert decimal to base-11:**\n   - Divide 522 by 11, which gives a quotient of 47 and a remainder of 5.\n   - Divide 47 by 11, which gives a quotient of 4 and a remainder of 3.\n   - Divide 4 by 11, which gives a quotient of 0 and a remainder of 4.\n   - Reading the remainders from last to first gives the base-11 number 435.\n\nThe conversion process and the result are correct. Therefore, the base-11 equivalent of the base-5 number 4042 is indeed 435.\n\n<<<'435'>>>"
