    "To convert a number from base-3 to base-14, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the base-3 number to a decimal (base-10) number.**\n   - The base-3 number 2211 can be expanded as:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 3^3 + 2 \\times 3^2 + 1 \\times 3^1 + 1 \\times 3^0\n     \\]\n\n2. **Convert the decimal number to base-14.**\n   - Once we have the decimal equivalent, we can convert it to base-14 by repeatedly dividing the number by 14 and recording the remainders.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-3 number to decimal\nbase_3_number = '2211'\ndecimal_number = 0\nbase_3_length = len(base_3_number)\n\nfor i in range(base_3_length):\n    digit = int(base_3_number[base_3_length - i - 1])\n    decimal_number += digit * (3 ** i)\n\n# Step 2: Convert decimal number to base-14\nbase_14_number = ''\nwhile decimal_number > 0:\n    remainder = decimal_number % 14\n    if remainder >= 10:\n        # Convert remainder to corresponding letter\n        base_14_number = chr(remainder - 10 + ord('a')) + base_14_number\n    else:\n        base_14_number = str(remainder) + base_14_number\n    decimal_number //= 14\n\nprint(base_14_number)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the base-14 equivalent of the base-3 number 2211.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the base-3 number 2211 has been successfully converted to the base-14 number 56. This result is consistent with the expected conversion process.\n\nTo summarize the steps taken:\n\n1. **Conversion from Base-3 to Decimal:**\n   - The base-3 number 2211 was converted to its decimal equivalent, which is 76.\n\n2. **Conversion from Decimal to Base-14:**\n   - The decimal number 76 was then converted to base-14, resulting in the number 56.\n\nThe conversion process was executed correctly, and the final base-14 representation of the base-3 number 2211 is 56.\n\n<<<'56'>>>"
