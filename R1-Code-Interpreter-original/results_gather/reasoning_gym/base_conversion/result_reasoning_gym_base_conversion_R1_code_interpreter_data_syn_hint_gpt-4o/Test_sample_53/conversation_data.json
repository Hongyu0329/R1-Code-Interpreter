    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the number from the original base to base 10 (decimal):**\n   - Start from the rightmost digit, multiply each digit by the base raised to the power of its position index (starting from 0), and sum all these values.\n\n2. **Convert the base 10 number to the target base:**\n   - Divide the number by the target base and keep track of the remainders.\n   - The remainders, read in reverse order, give the digits of the number in the target base.\n\nLet's apply this to convert the base-13 number \"129\" to base-11.\n\n### Step 1: Convert from base-13 to base-10\n\nThe base-13 number \"129\" can be broken down as:\n- \\(1 \\times 13^2 + 2 \\times 13^1 + 9 \\times 13^0\\)\n\n### Step 2: Convert from base-10 to base-11\n\nOnce we have the base-10 equivalent, we will convert it to base-11 by dividing by 11 and recording the remainders.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-13 to base-10\nbase_13_number = \"129\"\nbase_13 = 13\nbase_10_number = 0\n\n# Calculate base-10 equivalent\nfor i, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_13_number)):\n    base_10_number += int(digit) * (base_13 ** i)\n\n# Step 2: Convert base-10 to base-11\nbase_11 = 11\nbase_11_number = \"\"\n\nwhile base_10_number > 0:\n    remainder = base_10_number % base_11\n    base_11_number = str(remainder) + base_11_number\n    base_10_number //= base_11\n\nprint(base_11_number)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the base-11 equivalent of the base-13 number \"129\".",
    "The code execution result indicates that the base-11 equivalent of the base-13 number \"129\" is \"176\". This result is consistent with the conversion process described.\n\nTo ensure the accuracy of the conversion, let's verify the steps:\n\n1. **Convert \"129\" from base-13 to base-10:**\n   - \\(1 \\times 13^2 = 169\\)\n   - \\(2 \\times 13^1 = 26\\)\n   - \\(9 \\times 13^0 = 9\\)\n   - Sum: \\(169 + 26 + 9 = 204\\)\n\n2. **Convert 204 from base-10 to base-11:**\n   - \\(204 \\div 11 = 18\\) remainder \\(6\\)\n   - \\(18 \\div 11 = 1\\) remainder \\(7\\)\n   - \\(1 \\div 11 = 0\\) remainder \\(1\\)\n\nReading the remainders from last to first gives us \"176\" in base-11.\n\nThe conversion process and the code execution are correct. Therefore, the base-11 equivalent of the base-13 number \"129\" is:\n\n<<<'176'>>>"
