    "To convert a number from base-7 to base-11, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the base-7 number to a decimal (base-10) number.**\n   - The base-7 number 1402 can be expanded as:\n     \\[\n     1 \\times 7^3 + 4 \\times 7^2 + 0 \\times 7^1 + 2 \\times 7^0\n     \\]\n\n2. **Convert the decimal number to base-11.**\n   - Once we have the decimal equivalent, we can convert it to base-11 by repeatedly dividing the number by 11 and recording the remainders.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-7 number 1402 to decimal\nbase_7_number = \"1402\"\ndecimal_number = 0\nbase_7_length = len(base_7_number)\n\nfor i in range(base_7_length):\n    digit = int(base_7_number[i])\n    power = base_7_length - i - 1\n    decimal_number += digit * (7 ** power)\n\n# Step 2: Convert the decimal number to base-11\nbase_11_number = \"\"\nwhile decimal_number > 0:\n    remainder = decimal_number % 11\n    if remainder >= 10:\n        # Convert remainder to corresponding letter for base > 10\n        base_11_number = chr(remainder - 10 + ord('a')) + base_11_number\n    else:\n        base_11_number = str(remainder) + base_11_number\n    decimal_number //= 11\n\nprint(base_11_number)\n```\n\nThis code will convert the base-7 number 1402 to its base-11 equivalent. Let's execute it to find the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the base-7 number 1402 has been successfully converted to the base-11 number 452. \n\nTo ensure the accuracy of the conversion, let's review the steps:\n\n1. **Convert from base-7 to decimal:**\n   - \\(1 \\times 7^3 = 343\\)\n   - \\(4 \\times 7^2 = 196\\)\n   - \\(0 \\times 7^1 = 0\\)\n   - \\(2 \\times 7^0 = 2\\)\n   - Sum: \\(343 + 196 + 0 + 2 = 541\\)\n\n2. **Convert from decimal to base-11:**\n   - Divide 541 by 11, quotient is 49, remainder is 2.\n   - Divide 49 by 11, quotient is 4, remainder is 5.\n   - Divide 4 by 11, quotient is 0, remainder is 4.\n   - Read remainders from last to first: 452\n\nThe conversion process is correct, and the base-11 representation of the base-7 number 1402 is indeed 452.\n\n<<<'452'>>>"
