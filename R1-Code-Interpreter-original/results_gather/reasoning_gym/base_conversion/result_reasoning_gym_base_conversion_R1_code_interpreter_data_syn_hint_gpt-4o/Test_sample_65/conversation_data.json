    "To convert a number from base-8 to base-14, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the base-8 number to a base-10 number**: This is done by multiplying each digit of the base-8 number by 8 raised to the power of its position index (starting from 0 from the right).\n\n2. **Convert the base-10 number to base-14**: This involves repeatedly dividing the base-10 number by 14 and recording the remainders. The remainders, read in reverse order, give the digits of the base-14 number.\n\nLet's perform these steps using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-8 number to base-10\nbase_8_number = '307'\nbase_10_number = int(base_8_number, 8)\n\n# Step 2: Convert base-10 number to base-14\ndef base_10_to_base_14(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n:\n        remainder = n % 14\n        if remainder >= 10:\n            # Convert remainder to corresponding letter\n            digits.append(chr(remainder - 10 + ord('a')))\n        else:\n            digits.append(str(remainder))\n        n //= 14\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\nbase_14_number = base_10_to_base_14(base_10_number)\nprint(base_14_number)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the base-14 equivalent of the base-8 number 307.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the base-8 number 307 has been successfully converted to the base-14 number 103. This result is consistent with the expected conversion process.\n\nTo summarize the steps taken:\n\n1. **Convert from base-8 to base-10**: The base-8 number 307 was converted to its base-10 equivalent, which is 199.\n\n2. **Convert from base-10 to base-14**: The base-10 number 199 was then converted to base-14, resulting in the number 103.\n\nThe conversion process was executed correctly, and the final base-14 representation of the base-8 number 307 is 103.\n\n<<<'103'>>>"
