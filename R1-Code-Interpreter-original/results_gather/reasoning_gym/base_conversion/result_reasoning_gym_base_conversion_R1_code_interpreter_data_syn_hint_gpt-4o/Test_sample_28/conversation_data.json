    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the number from the original base to base 10 (decimal):**\n   - Start from the rightmost digit, multiply each digit by the base raised to the power of its position index (starting from 0), and sum all these values.\n\n2. **Convert the decimal number to the target base:**\n   - Divide the decimal number by the target base, keep track of the remainder, and use the quotient for the next division.\n   - Continue this process until the quotient is zero.\n   - The remainders, read in reverse order, give the number in the target base.\n\nLet's apply this process to convert the base-6 number 1243 to base-11.\n\n### Step 1: Convert from base-6 to base-10\n\nThe base-6 number 1243 can be expanded as:\n\\[ 1 \\times 6^3 + 2 \\times 6^2 + 4 \\times 6^1 + 3 \\times 6^0 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Convert from base-10 to base-11\n\nOnce we have the decimal equivalent, we will convert it to base-11.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the result.\n\n```python\n# Convert base-6 number 1243 to base-10\nbase_6_number = \"1243\"\nbase_6 = 6\n\n# Convert to decimal\ndecimal_number = 0\nfor index, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_6_number)):\n    decimal_number += int(digit) * (base_6 ** index)\n\n# Convert decimal to base-11\nbase_11 = 11\nbase_11_number = \"\"\nwhile decimal_number > 0:\n    remainder = decimal_number % base_11\n    if remainder >= 10:\n        # Convert remainder to corresponding letter\n        base_11_number = chr(remainder - 10 + ord('a')) + base_11_number\n    else:\n        base_11_number = str(remainder) + base_11_number\n    decimal_number //= base_11\n\nprint(base_11_number)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the base-11 equivalent of the base-6 number 1243.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the base-6 number 1243 is correctly converted to the base-11 number 267. The process involved converting the number from base-6 to base-10 and then from base-10 to base-11.\n\nThe steps were as follows:\n\n1. **Convert from base-6 to base-10:**\n   - \\(1 \\times 6^3 + 2 \\times 6^2 + 4 \\times 6^1 + 3 \\times 6^0 = 1 \\times 216 + 2 \\times 36 + 4 \\times 6 + 3 \\times 1 = 267\\)\n\n2. **Convert from base-10 to base-11:**\n   - 267 divided by 11 gives a quotient of 24 and a remainder of 3.\n   - 24 divided by 11 gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 2.\n   - 2 divided by 11 gives a quotient of 0 and a remainder of 2.\n   - Reading the remainders from last to first gives us 267 in base-11.\n\nThe conversion is correct, and the base-11 representation of the base-6 number 1243 is indeed 267.\n\n<<<answer>>>267<<<answer>>>"
