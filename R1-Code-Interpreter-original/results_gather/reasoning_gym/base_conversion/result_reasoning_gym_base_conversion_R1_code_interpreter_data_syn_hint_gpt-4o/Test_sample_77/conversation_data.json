    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the number from the original base to base-10 (decimal).\n2. Convert the base-10 number to the target base.\n\nLet's apply these steps to convert the base-5 number 2121 to base-9.\n\n### Step 1: Convert from base-5 to base-10\n\nThe base-5 number 2121 can be expanded as follows:\n\n\\[ 2121_{5} = 2 \\times 5^3 + 1 \\times 5^2 + 2 \\times 5^1 + 1 \\times 5^0 \\]\n\nLet's calculate this value in base-10.\n\n### Step 2: Convert from base-10 to base-9\n\nOnce we have the base-10 equivalent, we can convert it to base-9 by repeatedly dividing the number by 9 and recording the remainders.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Convert base-5 number 2121 to base-10\nbase_5_number = \"2121\"\nbase_10_number = sum(int(digit) * (5 ** idx) for idx, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_5_number)))\n\n# Convert base-10 number to base-9\nbase_9_number = \"\"\nwhile base_10_number > 0:\n    remainder = base_10_number % 9\n    base_9_number = str(remainder) + base_9_number\n    base_10_number //= 9\n\nprint(base_9_number)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the base-9 equivalent of the base-5 number 2121.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the base-5 number 2121 has been successfully converted to the base-9 number 347. The process involved converting the number from base-5 to base-10 and then from base-10 to base-9.\n\nThe steps were as follows:\n\n1. **Convert from base-5 to base-10:**\n   - \\( 2121_5 = 2 \\times 5^3 + 1 \\times 5^2 + 2 \\times 5^1 + 1 \\times 5^0 = 276_{10} \\)\n\n2. **Convert from base-10 to base-9:**\n   - Divide 276 by 9, record the remainder, and continue with the quotient until the quotient is zero.\n   - The remainders, read in reverse order, give the base-9 number: 347.\n\nThus, the base-9 equivalent of the base-5 number 2121 is 347.\n\n<<<'347'>>>"
