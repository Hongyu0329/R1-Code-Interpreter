    "To convert a base-10 number to another base, we can use the method of repeated division by the target base and keeping track of the remainders. These remainders represent the digits of the number in the new base, starting from the least significant digit (rightmost) to the most significant digit (leftmost).\n\nHere's the step-by-step process to convert the base-10 number 418 to base-13:\n\n1. Divide the number by the new base (13) and record the remainder.\n2. Update the number to be the quotient from the division.\n3. Repeat the process until the quotient is zero.\n4. The base-13 number is the sequence of remainders read in reverse order.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the base-13 representation of 418.\n\n```python\ndef convert_to_base(n, base):\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        remainder = n % base\n        if remainder >= 10:\n            # Convert remainder to corresponding letter for bases > 10\n            remainder = chr(remainder - 10 + ord('a'))\n        digits.append(str(remainder))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(digits[::-1])\n\n# Convert 418 to base-13\nresult = convert_to_base(418, 13)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the base-13 representation of 418.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the conversion was successful, and the base-13 representation of the base-10 number 418 is \"262\". \n\nThe process involved dividing the number by 13, recording the remainders, and then reversing the order of the remainders to get the final result. The code correctly handles the conversion for bases greater than 10 by using letters for digits above 9.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<'262'>>>"
