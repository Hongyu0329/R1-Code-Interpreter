    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the number from the original base to base-10 (decimal):**\n   - For a base-9 number like 461, we calculate its decimal equivalent by multiplying each digit by 9 raised to the power of its position index (starting from 0 from the right).\n\n2. **Convert the decimal number to the target base (base-8 in this case):**\n   - Divide the decimal number by the target base (8) and keep track of the remainders. The remainders, read in reverse order, give the digits of the number in the target base.\n\nLet's perform these steps using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-9 number 461 to decimal\nbase_9_number = '461'\ndecimal_number = 0\nbase_9 = 9\n\n# Calculate the decimal equivalent\nfor index, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_9_number)):\n    decimal_number += int(digit) * (base_9 ** index)\n\n# Step 2: Convert the decimal number to base-8\nbase_8 = 8\nbase_8_number = ''\n\nwhile decimal_number > 0:\n    remainder = decimal_number % base_8\n    base_8_number = str(remainder) + base_8_number\n    decimal_number //= base_8\n\nprint(base_8_number)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the base-8 equivalent of the base-9 number 461.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the conversion process was successful, and the base-8 equivalent of the base-9 number 461 is 573. \n\nThe process involved:\n1. Converting the base-9 number 461 to its decimal equivalent.\n2. Converting the resulting decimal number to base-8.\n\nThe code correctly implemented these steps, and the output is the base-8 representation of the given base-9 number.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<'573'>>>"
