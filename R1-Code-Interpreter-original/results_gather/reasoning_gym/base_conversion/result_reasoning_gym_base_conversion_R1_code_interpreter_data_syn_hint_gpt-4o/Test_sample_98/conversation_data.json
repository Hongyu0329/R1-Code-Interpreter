    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the number from the original base to base-10 (decimal):**\n   - The base-8 number 1024 can be expanded as:\n     \\[\n     1 \\times 8^3 + 0 \\times 8^2 + 2 \\times 8^1 + 4 \\times 8^0\n     \\]\n\n2. **Convert the base-10 number to the target base (base-6 in this case):**\n   - We repeatedly divide the base-10 number by the target base (6) and keep track of the remainders. The remainders, read in reverse order, give us the number in the target base.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-8 number 1024 to base-10\nbase_8_number = \"1024\"\nbase_10_number = int(base_8_number, 8)\n\n# Step 2: Convert base-10 number to base-6\ndef convert_to_base_6(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return \"0\"\n    digits = []\n    while n:\n        digits.append(int(n % 6))\n        n //= 6\n    return ''.join(str(x) for x in digits[::-1])\n\nbase_6_number = convert_to_base_6(base_10_number)\nprint(base_6_number)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the base-6 equivalent of the base-8 number 1024.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the base-8 number 1024 has been successfully converted to the base-6 number 2244. This confirms that the conversion process was correctly implemented.\n\nTo summarize the steps taken:\n\n1. **Conversion from Base-8 to Base-10:**\n   - The base-8 number 1024 was converted to base-10 using the formula:\n     \\[\n     1 \\times 8^3 + 0 \\times 8^2 + 2 \\times 8^1 + 4 \\times 8^0 = 512 + 0 + 16 + 4 = 532\n     \\]\n\n2. **Conversion from Base-10 to Base-6:**\n   - The base-10 number 532 was converted to base-6 by repeatedly dividing by 6 and recording the remainders:\n     - 532 รท 6 = 88 remainder 4\n     - 88 รท 6 = 14 remainder 4\n     - 14 รท 6 = 2 remainder 2\n     - 2 รท 6 = 0 remainder 2\n   - Reading the remainders in reverse order gives the base-6 number 2244.\n\nThe final answer is the base-6 representation of the base-8 number 1024.\n\n<<<'2244'>>>"
