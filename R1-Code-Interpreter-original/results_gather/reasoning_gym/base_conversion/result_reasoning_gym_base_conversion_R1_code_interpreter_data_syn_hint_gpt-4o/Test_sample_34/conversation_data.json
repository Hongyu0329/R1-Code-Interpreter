    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the number from the original base to base-10 (decimal).\n2. Convert the base-10 number to the target base.\n\nLet's apply these steps to convert the base-6 number 200 to base-8.\n\n### Step 1: Convert from base-6 to base-10\n\nThe base-6 number 200 can be expanded as:\n\\[ 2 \\times 6^2 + 0 \\times 6^1 + 0 \\times 6^0 \\]\n\nCalculating this gives us the base-10 equivalent.\n\n### Step 2: Convert from base-10 to base-8\n\nOnce we have the base-10 number, we can convert it to base-8 by repeatedly dividing the number by 8 and recording the remainders.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the final result.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-6 number 200 to base-10\nbase_6_number = \"200\"\nbase_10_number = int(base_6_number, 6)\n\n# Step 2: Convert base-10 number to base-8\nbase_8_number = \"\"\nwhile base_10_number > 0:\n    remainder = base_10_number % 8\n    base_8_number = str(remainder) + base_8_number\n    base_10_number //= 8\n\nprint(base_8_number)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the base-8 equivalent of the base-6 number 200.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the base-8 equivalent of the base-6 number 200 is 110. Let's verify this result through reasoning:\n\n### Step 1: Convert from base-6 to base-10\n\nThe base-6 number 200 can be expanded as:\n\\[ 2 \\times 6^2 + 0 \\times 6^1 + 0 \\times 6^0 = 2 \\times 36 + 0 \\times 6 + 0 \\times 1 = 72 \\]\n\nSo, the base-10 equivalent is 72.\n\n### Step 2: Convert from base-10 to base-8\n\nNow, convert 72 from base-10 to base-8:\n\n1. Divide 72 by 8, which gives a quotient of 9 and a remainder of 0.\n2. Divide 9 by 8, which gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 1.\n3. Divide 1 by 8, which gives a quotient of 0 and a remainder of 1.\n\nReading the remainders from last to first, the base-8 equivalent is 110.\n\nThe code execution result is correct. Therefore, the base-8 equivalent of the base-6 number 200 is 110.\n\n<<<answer>>>110<<<answer>>>"
