    "To convert a number from base-7 to base-8, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the base-7 number to a base-10 number**: This is done by multiplying each digit of the base-7 number by 7 raised to the power of its position (counting from right to left, starting at 0).\n\n2. **Convert the base-10 number to a base-8 number**: This involves repeatedly dividing the base-10 number by 8 and recording the remainders. The base-8 number is formed by the remainders read in reverse order.\n\nLet's perform these steps for the base-7 number 125.\n\n### Step 1: Convert base-7 to base-10\n\nThe base-7 number 125 can be expanded as:\n\\[ 1 \\times 7^2 + 2 \\times 7^1 + 5 \\times 7^0 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Convert base-10 to base-8\n\nOnce we have the base-10 equivalent, we will convert it to base-8 by dividing by 8 and recording the remainders.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the result.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-7 to base-10\nbase_7_number = \"125\"\nbase_10_number = 0\nfor i, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_7_number)):\n    base_10_number += int(digit) * (7 ** i)\n\n# Step 2: Convert base-10 to base-8\nbase_8_number = \"\"\nwhile base_10_number > 0:\n    remainder = base_10_number % 8\n    base_8_number = str(remainder) + base_8_number\n    base_10_number //= 8\n\nprint(base_8_number)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the base-8 equivalent of the base-7 number 125.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the conversion process was successful, and the base-8 equivalent of the base-7 number 125 is 104. \n\nLet's verify the steps to ensure the conversion is correct:\n\n1. **Convert base-7 to base-10:**\n   - The base-7 number 125 is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     1 \\times 7^2 + 2 \\times 7^1 + 5 \\times 7^0 = 49 + 14 + 5 = 68\n     \\]\n\n2. **Convert base-10 to base-8:**\n   - Convert 68 to base-8:\n     - 68 divided by 8 gives a quotient of 8 and a remainder of 4.\n     - 8 divided by 8 gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 0.\n     - 1 divided by 8 gives a quotient of 0 and a remainder of 1.\n   - Reading the remainders from last to first gives us 104 in base-8.\n\nThe conversion process and the result are correct. Therefore, the base-8 equivalent of the base-7 number 125 is indeed 104.\n\n<<<'104'>>>"
