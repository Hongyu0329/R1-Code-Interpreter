    "To convert a binary number to a hexadecimal number, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Group the binary digits into sets of four**, starting from the right. If the number of binary digits is not a multiple of four, pad the leftmost group with zeros.\n\n2. **Convert each group of four binary digits to a single hexadecimal digit**. Each group of four binary digits corresponds to a single hexadecimal digit.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the binary number 100010010:\n\n1. Group the binary digits into sets of four:\n   - 100010010 becomes 0001 0001 0010 (padded with zeros on the left to make full groups of four).\n\n2. Convert each group to hexadecimal:\n   - 0001 in binary is 1 in hexadecimal.\n   - 0001 in binary is 1 in hexadecimal.\n   - 0010 in binary is 2 in hexadecimal.\n\nSo, the binary number 100010010 converts to 112 in hexadecimal.\n\nNow, let's confirm this conversion using a Python script:\n\n```python\ndef binary_to_hex(binary_str):\n    # Convert binary to integer\n    decimal_value = int(binary_str, 2)\n    # Convert integer to hexadecimal\n    hex_value = hex(decimal_value)[2:]  # [2:] to remove the '0x' prefix\n    return hex_value\n\nbinary_number = \"100010010\"\nhexadecimal_number = binary_to_hex(binary_number)\nprint(hexadecimal_number)\n```\n\nThis script will convert the binary number to hexadecimal and print the result.",
    "The code execution result confirms that the binary number 100010010 converts to 112 in hexadecimal. The process of grouping the binary digits into sets of four and converting each group to a hexadecimal digit was correctly implemented in the code.\n\nThe conversion steps were straightforward, and the code correctly handled the conversion from binary to hexadecimal using Python's built-in functions. The result matches the expected conversion.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<'112'>>>"
