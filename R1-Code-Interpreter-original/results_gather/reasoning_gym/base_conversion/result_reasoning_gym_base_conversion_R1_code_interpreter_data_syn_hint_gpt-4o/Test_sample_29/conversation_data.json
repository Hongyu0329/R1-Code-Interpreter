    "To convert a number from base-4 to base-10, we need to understand the positional value of each digit in the base-4 number. Each digit in a base-4 number represents a power of 4, starting from the rightmost digit which is 4^0, then 4^1, 4^2, and so on.\n\nThe base-4 number 13322 can be broken down as follows:\n\n- The rightmost digit (2) is in the 4^0 position.\n- The next digit (2) is in the 4^1 position.\n- The next digit (3) is in the 4^2 position.\n- The next digit (3) is in the 4^3 position.\n- The leftmost digit (1) is in the 4^4 position.\n\nTo convert this to base-10, we calculate the sum of each digit multiplied by its positional value:\n\n1. \\(1 \\times 4^4\\)\n2. \\(3 \\times 4^3\\)\n3. \\(3 \\times 4^2\\)\n4. \\(2 \\times 4^1\\)\n5. \\(2 \\times 4^0\\)\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Base-4 number\nbase_4_number = \"13322\"\n\n# Convert base-4 to base-10\nbase_10_number = sum(int(digit) * (4 ** idx) for idx, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_4_number)))\n\nprint(base_10_number)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the base-10 equivalent.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the base-4 number 13322 is equivalent to 506 in base-10. The calculation was performed by summing each digit of the base-4 number multiplied by its corresponding power of 4, starting from the rightmost digit.\n\nThe breakdown of the calculation is as follows:\n\n- \\(1 \\times 4^4 = 1 \\times 256 = 256\\)\n- \\(3 \\times 4^3 = 3 \\times 64 = 192\\)\n- \\(3 \\times 4^2 = 3 \\times 16 = 48\\)\n- \\(2 \\times 4^1 = 2 \\times 4 = 8\\)\n- \\(2 \\times 4^0 = 2 \\times 1 = 2\\)\n\nAdding these values together gives:\n\n\\[256 + 192 + 48 + 8 + 2 = 506\\]\n\nTherefore, the base-10 equivalent of the base-4 number 13322 is 506.\n\n<<<answer>>>"
