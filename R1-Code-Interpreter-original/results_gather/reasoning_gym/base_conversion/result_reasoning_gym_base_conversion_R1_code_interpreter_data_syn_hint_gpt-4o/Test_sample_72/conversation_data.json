    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the original number to a decimal (base-10) number.**  \n   The given number is in binary (base-2), so we need to convert it to decimal first. \n\n2. **Convert the decimal number to the target base.**  \n   Once we have the decimal equivalent, we can convert it to the desired base, which is base-15 in this case.\n\nLet's start by converting the binary number `1111010110` to a decimal number.\n\nThe binary number `1111010110` can be expanded as follows:\n- \\(1 \\times 2^9 + 1 \\times 2^8 + 1 \\times 2^7 + 1 \\times 2^6 + 0 \\times 2^5 + 1 \\times 2^4 + 0 \\times 2^3 + 1 \\times 2^2 + 1 \\times 2^1 + 0 \\times 2^0\\)\n\nNow, let's calculate this using Python code to get the decimal equivalent.\n\n```python\n# Convert binary to decimal\nbinary_number = '1111010110'\ndecimal_number = int(binary_number, 2)\nprint(decimal_number)\n```\n\nOnce we have the decimal number, we will convert it to base-15. Let's execute the code to find the decimal equivalent first.",
    "The code execution result shows that the binary number `1111010110` is equivalent to `982` in decimal. Now, we need to convert this decimal number `982` to base-15.\n\nTo convert a decimal number to another base, we repeatedly divide the number by the base and record the remainders. These remainders represent the digits of the number in the new base, starting from the least significant digit.\n\nLet's perform this conversion using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Convert decimal to base-15\ndef decimal_to_base15(decimal_number):\n    if decimal_number == 0:\n        return '0'\n    \n    digits = []\n    while decimal_number > 0:\n        remainder = decimal_number % 15\n        if remainder >= 10:\n            # Convert remainder to corresponding letter for base > 10\n            digits.append(chr(remainder - 10 + ord('a')))\n        else:\n            digits.append(str(remainder))\n        decimal_number //= 15\n    \n    # The digits are in reverse order\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\nbase_15_number = decimal_to_base15(982)\nprint(base_15_number)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the base-15 equivalent of the decimal number `982`.",
    "The code execution result shows that the decimal number `982` is equivalent to `457` in base-15. \n\nTo summarize the process:\n1. We converted the binary number `1111010110` to its decimal equivalent, which is `982`.\n2. We then converted the decimal number `982` to base-15, resulting in `457`.\n\nTherefore, the binary number `1111010110` is `457` in base-15.\n\n<<<'457'>>>"
