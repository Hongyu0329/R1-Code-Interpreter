    "To convert a number from base-11 to base-10, we need to understand the positional value of each digit in the base-11 number. The number 730 in base-11 can be broken down as follows:\n\n- The rightmost digit (0) is in the 11^0 position.\n- The middle digit (3) is in the 11^1 position.\n- The leftmost digit (7) is in the 11^2 position.\n\nThe base-10 equivalent can be calculated by multiplying each digit by its positional value and summing the results:\n\n\\[ \\text{Base-10 equivalent} = 7 \\times 11^2 + 3 \\times 11^1 + 0 \\times 11^0 \\]\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Base-11 number\nbase_11_number = \"730\"\n\n# Convert base-11 to base-10\nbase_10_number = int(base_11_number, 11)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(base_10_number)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the base-10 equivalent.",
    "The code execution result is correct, and the base-10 equivalent of the base-11 number 730 is 880. The calculation was performed by converting the base-11 number directly to base-10 using Python's `int` function, which simplifies the conversion process.\n\nThe breakdown of the conversion is as follows:\n- \\(7 \\times 11^2 = 7 \\times 121 = 847\\)\n- \\(3 \\times 11^1 = 3 \\times 11 = 33\\)\n- \\(0 \\times 11^0 = 0 \\times 1 = 0\\)\n\nAdding these values together gives:\n\\[ 847 + 33 + 0 = 880 \\]\n\nTherefore, the base-10 equivalent of the base-11 number 730 is 880.\n\n<<<answer>>>880<<<answer>>>"
