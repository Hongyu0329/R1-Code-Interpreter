    "To convert a number from base-3 to base-10, we need to understand the positional value of each digit in the base-3 number. Each digit in a base-3 number represents a power of 3, starting from the rightmost digit which is 3^0, then 3^1, 3^2, and so on.\n\nThe base-3 number given is 101121. We will convert it to base-10 by calculating the sum of each digit multiplied by 3 raised to the power of its position index (starting from 0 on the right).\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- The rightmost digit is 1, and its position is 0, so its value is 1 * 3^0.\n- The next digit is 2, and its position is 1, so its value is 2 * 3^1.\n- The next digit is 1, and its position is 2, so its value is 1 * 3^2.\n- The next digit is 1, and its position is 3, so its value is 1 * 3^3.\n- The next digit is 0, and its position is 4, so its value is 0 * 3^4.\n- The leftmost digit is 1, and its position is 5, so its value is 1 * 3^5.\n\nNow, let's calculate the base-10 value using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Base-3 number\nbase_3_number = \"101121\"\n\n# Convert base-3 to base-10\nbase_10_value = 0\nfor index, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_3_number)):\n    base_10_value += int(digit) * (3 ** index)\n\nprint(base_10_value)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the base-10 equivalent of the base-3 number 101121.",
    "The code execution result shows that the base-10 equivalent of the base-3 number 101121 is 286. This result is consistent with the expected conversion process from base-3 to base-10.\n\nTo ensure the correctness of the conversion, let's verify the calculation step-by-step:\n\n1. \\(1 \\times 3^5 = 1 \\times 243 = 243\\)\n2. \\(0 \\times 3^4 = 0 \\times 81 = 0\\)\n3. \\(1 \\times 3^3 = 1 \\times 27 = 27\\)\n4. \\(1 \\times 3^2 = 1 \\times 9 = 9\\)\n5. \\(2 \\times 3^1 = 2 \\times 3 = 6\\)\n6. \\(1 \\times 3^0 = 1 \\times 1 = 1\\)\n\nAdding these values together gives:\n\n\\[243 + 0 + 27 + 9 + 6 + 1 = 286\\]\n\nThe calculation confirms that the base-10 equivalent of the base-3 number 101121 is indeed 286.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<'answer'>>> 286"
