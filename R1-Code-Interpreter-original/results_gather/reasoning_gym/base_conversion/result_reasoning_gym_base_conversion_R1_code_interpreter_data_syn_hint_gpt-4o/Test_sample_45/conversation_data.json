    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the number from the original base to base-10 (decimal):**\n   - Start from the rightmost digit, multiply each digit by the base raised to the power of its position index (starting from 0), and sum all these values.\n\n2. **Convert the base-10 number to the target base:**\n   - Divide the number by the target base and keep track of the remainders. The remainders, read in reverse order, give the digits of the number in the target base.\n\nLet's apply this process to convert the base-6 number 3442 to base-7.\n\n### Step 1: Convert from base-6 to base-10\n\nThe base-6 number 3442 can be converted to base-10 as follows:\n\n\\[ 3442_{6} = 3 \\times 6^3 + 4 \\times 6^2 + 4 \\times 6^1 + 2 \\times 6^0 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Convert from base-10 to base-7\n\nOnce we have the base-10 equivalent, we can convert it to base-7 by repeatedly dividing by 7 and recording the remainders.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Convert base-6 number 3442 to base-10\nbase_6_number = \"3442\"\nbase_10_number = sum(int(digit) * (6 ** idx) for idx, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_6_number)))\n\n# Convert base-10 number to base-7\nbase_7_number = \"\"\nwhile base_10_number > 0:\n    remainder = base_10_number % 7\n    base_7_number = str(remainder) + base_7_number\n    base_10_number //= 7\n\nprint(base_7_number)\n```\n\nThis code will output the base-7 equivalent of the base-6 number 3442.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the conversion from base-6 to base-7 was successful, and the base-7 equivalent of the base-6 number 3442 is 2246.\n\nLet's verify the steps to ensure the conversion is correct:\n\n1. **Convert from base-6 to base-10:**\n\n   \\[\n   3442_6 = 3 \\times 6^3 + 4 \\times 6^2 + 4 \\times 6^1 + 2 \\times 6^0\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   = 3 \\times 216 + 4 \\times 36 + 4 \\times 6 + 2 \\times 1\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   = 648 + 144 + 24 + 2 = 818\n   \\]\n\n2. **Convert from base-10 to base-7:**\n\n   - Divide 818 by 7: quotient = 116, remainder = 6\n   - Divide 116 by 7: quotient = 16, remainder = 4\n   - Divide 16 by 7: quotient = 2, remainder = 2\n   - Divide 2 by 7: quotient = 0, remainder = 2\n\n   Reading the remainders from bottom to top gives us 2246 in base-7.\n\nThe conversion process and the result are correct. Therefore, the base-7 equivalent of the base-6 number 3442 is indeed 2246.\n\n<<<'2246'>>>"
