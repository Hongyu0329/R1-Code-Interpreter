    "To convert a base-10 number to another base, we can use the method of successive division by the target base and keeping track of the remainders. These remainders represent the digits of the number in the new base, starting from the least significant digit (rightmost) to the most significant digit (leftmost).\n\nLet's break down the conversion of the base-10 number 778 to base-13:\n\n1. Divide the number by the base (13) and record the remainder.\n2. Update the number to be the quotient of the division.\n3. Repeat the process until the quotient is zero.\n4. The base-13 number is the sequence of remainders read in reverse order.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\ndef convert_base_10_to_base_n(number, base):\n    if number == 0:\n        return \"0\"\n    \n    digits = []\n    while number > 0:\n        remainder = number % base\n        if remainder >= 10:\n            # Convert remainder to corresponding letter for bases > 10\n            digits.append(chr(remainder - 10 + ord('a')))\n        else:\n            digits.append(str(remainder))\n        number = number // base\n    \n    # Reverse the digits to get the correct base-n representation\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\n# Convert 778 from base-10 to base-13\nresult = convert_base_10_to_base_n(778, 13)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will convert the number 778 from base-10 to base-13 and print the result. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code execution result \"47b\" is the correct conversion of the base-10 number 778 to base-13. The process of converting a number from base-10 to another base involves dividing the number by the target base and recording the remainders, which represent the digits in the new base.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the conversion:\n\n1. 778 divided by 13 gives a quotient of 59 and a remainder of 11. In base-13, 11 is represented by 'b'.\n2. 59 divided by 13 gives a quotient of 4 and a remainder of 7.\n3. 4 divided by 13 gives a quotient of 0 and a remainder of 4.\n\nReading the remainders from last to first gives us the base-13 number: 47b.\n\nTherefore, the base-13 representation of the base-10 number 778 is \"47b\".\n\n<<<'47b'>>>"
