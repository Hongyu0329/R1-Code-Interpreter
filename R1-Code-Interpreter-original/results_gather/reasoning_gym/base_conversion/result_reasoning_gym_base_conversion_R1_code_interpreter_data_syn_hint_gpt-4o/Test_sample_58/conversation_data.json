    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the number from the original base to base 10 (decimal):**\n   - The base-13 number \"130\" can be broken down as follows:\n     - \\(1 \\times 13^2 + 3 \\times 13^1 + 0 \\times 13^0\\)\n\n2. **Convert the base 10 number to the target base (base-3 in this case):**\n   - Once we have the decimal equivalent, we can repeatedly divide the number by the target base (3) and keep track of the remainders. The remainders, read in reverse order, will give us the number in the target base.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-13 number \"130\" to decimal\nbase_13_number = \"130\"\nbase_13 = 13\n\n# Calculate the decimal equivalent\ndecimal_value = 0\nfor i, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_13_number)):\n    decimal_value += int(digit) * (base_13 ** i)\n\n# Step 2: Convert the decimal number to base-3\nbase_3 = 3\nbase_3_number = \"\"\n\nwhile decimal_value > 0:\n    remainder = decimal_value % base_3\n    base_3_number = str(remainder) + base_3_number\n    decimal_value //= base_3\n\nprint(base_3_number)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the base-3 equivalent of the base-13 number \"130\".",
    "The code execution result indicates that the conversion from base-13 to base-3 was successful, and the base-3 equivalent of the base-13 number \"130\" is \"21201\". \n\nLet's verify the steps to ensure the conversion is correct:\n\n1. **Convert base-13 number \"130\" to decimal:**\n   - \\(1 \\times 13^2 + 3 \\times 13^1 + 0 \\times 13^0 = 1 \\times 169 + 3 \\times 13 + 0 \\times 1 = 169 + 39 + 0 = 208\\)\n\n2. **Convert the decimal number 208 to base-3:**\n   - Divide 208 by 3, the quotient is 69 and the remainder is 1.\n   - Divide 69 by 3, the quotient is 23 and the remainder is 0.\n   - Divide 23 by 3, the quotient is 7 and the remainder is 2.\n   - Divide 7 by 3, the quotient is 2 and the remainder is 1.\n   - Divide 2 by 3, the quotient is 0 and the remainder is 2.\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top gives us \"21201\".\n\nThe conversion process and the result \"21201\" are correct. Therefore, the base-3 equivalent of the base-13 number \"130\" is indeed \"21201\".\n\n<<<'21201'>>>"
