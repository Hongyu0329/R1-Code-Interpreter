    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the number from the original base to base 10 (decimal):**\n   - Each digit in the number is multiplied by the base raised to the power of its position index (starting from 0 on the right).\n   - Sum all these values to get the decimal equivalent.\n\n2. **Convert the decimal number to the target base:**\n   - Divide the decimal number by the target base and keep track of the remainders.\n   - The remainders, read in reverse order, give the digits of the number in the target base.\n\nLet's apply this to convert the base-13 number `4c9` to base-11.\n\n### Step 1: Convert `4c9` from base-13 to decimal\n\n- The number `4c9` in base-13 can be broken down as:\n  - `4 * 13^2 + c * 13^1 + 9 * 13^0`\n  - Here, `c` in base-13 is equivalent to `12` in decimal.\n\n### Step 2: Convert the decimal number to base-11\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-13 to decimal\nbase_13_number = '4c9'\nbase_13 = 13\n\n# Convert each character to its decimal equivalent\ndecimal_value = 0\nfor i, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_13_number)):\n    if digit.isdigit():\n        value = int(digit)\n    else:\n        value = ord(digit) - ord('a') + 10\n    decimal_value += value * (base_13 ** i)\n\n# Step 2: Convert decimal to base-11\nbase_11 = 11\nbase_11_number = ''\nwhile decimal_value > 0:\n    remainder = decimal_value % base_11\n    if remainder >= 10:\n        base_11_number = chr(remainder - 10 + ord('a')) + base_11_number\n    else:\n        base_11_number = str(remainder) + base_11_number\n    decimal_value //= base_11\n\nprint(base_11_number)\n```\n\nThis script will convert the base-13 number `4c9` to its base-11 equivalent. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the conversion from base-13 to base-11 was successful, and the base-11 equivalent of the base-13 number `4c9` is `6a5`.\n\nThe process involved:\n1. Converting the base-13 number `4c9` to its decimal equivalent.\n2. Converting the resulting decimal number to base-11.\n\nThe final result of the conversion is `6a5` in base-11.\n\n<<<'6a5'>>>"
