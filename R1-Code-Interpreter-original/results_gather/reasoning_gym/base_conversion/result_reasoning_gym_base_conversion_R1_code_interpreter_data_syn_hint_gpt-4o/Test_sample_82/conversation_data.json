    "To convert a number from base-11 to base-3, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the base-11 number to a decimal (base-10) number.**\n   - The base-11 number 204 can be expanded as:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 11^2 + 0 \\times 11^1 + 4 \\times 11^0\n     \\]\n\n2. **Convert the decimal number to base-3.**\n   - Once we have the decimal equivalent, we can repeatedly divide the number by 3 and record the remainders. The base-3 number is obtained by reading the remainders in reverse order.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-11 number 204 to decimal\nbase_11_number = \"204\"\ndecimal_number = 0\nbase_11 = 11\n\n# Calculate the decimal equivalent\nfor i, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_11_number)):\n    decimal_number += int(digit) * (base_11 ** i)\n\n# Step 2: Convert the decimal number to base-3\nbase_3 = 3\nbase_3_number = \"\"\n\nwhile decimal_number > 0:\n    remainder = decimal_number % base_3\n    base_3_number = str(remainder) + base_3_number\n    decimal_number //= base_3\n\nprint(base_3_number)\n```\n\nThis code will convert the base-11 number 204 to its base-3 equivalent. Let's execute it to find the result.",
    "The code execution result shows that the base-11 number 204 has been successfully converted to the base-3 number 100010. The process involved converting the base-11 number to a decimal number and then converting that decimal number to base-3.\n\nThe steps were as follows:\n1. Convert the base-11 number 204 to a decimal number:\n   - \\(2 \\times 11^2 + 0 \\times 11^1 + 4 \\times 11^0 = 2 \\times 121 + 0 \\times 11 + 4 \\times 1 = 242 + 0 + 4 = 246\\)\n\n2. Convert the decimal number 246 to base-3:\n   - Divide 246 by 3, quotient is 82, remainder is 0\n   - Divide 82 by 3, quotient is 27, remainder is 1\n   - Divide 27 by 3, quotient is 9, remainder is 0\n   - Divide 9 by 3, quotient is 3, remainder is 0\n   - Divide 3 by 3, quotient is 1, remainder is 0\n   - Divide 1 by 3, quotient is 0, remainder is 1\n\nReading the remainders from bottom to top gives us the base-3 number: 100010.\n\nTherefore, the base-3 equivalent of the base-11 number 204 is 100010.\n\n<<<answer>>>100010<<<answer>>>"
