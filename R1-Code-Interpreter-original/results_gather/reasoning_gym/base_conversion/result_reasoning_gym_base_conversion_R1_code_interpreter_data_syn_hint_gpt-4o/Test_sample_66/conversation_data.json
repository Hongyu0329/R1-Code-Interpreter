    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the number from the original base to base 10 (decimal):**\n   - Start from the rightmost digit, multiply each digit by the base raised to the power of its position index (starting from 0), and sum all these values.\n\n2. **Convert the base 10 number to the target base:**\n   - Divide the number by the target base and keep track of the remainders.\n   - The remainders, read in reverse order, give the digits of the number in the target base.\n\nLet's apply this to convert the base-11 number 301 to base-15.\n\n### Step 1: Convert from base-11 to base-10\n\nThe base-11 number 301 can be converted to base-10 as follows:\n- \\(3 \\times 11^2 + 0 \\times 11^1 + 1 \\times 11^0\\)\n\n### Step 2: Convert from base-10 to base-15\n\nOnce we have the base-10 equivalent, we can convert it to base-15 by repeatedly dividing by 15 and recording the remainders.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the result.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-11 to base-10\nbase_11_number = \"301\"\nbase_11 = 11\n\n# Convert to base-10\nbase_10_number = 0\nfor index, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_11_number)):\n    base_10_number += int(digit) * (base_11 ** index)\n\n# Step 2: Convert base-10 to base-15\nbase_15 = 15\nbase_15_number = \"\"\n\nwhile base_10_number > 0:\n    remainder = base_10_number % base_15\n    if remainder >= 10:\n        # Convert remainder to corresponding letter\n        base_15_number = chr(remainder - 10 + ord('a')) + base_15_number\n    else:\n        base_15_number = str(remainder) + base_15_number\n    base_10_number //= base_15\n\nprint(base_15_number)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the base-15 equivalent of the base-11 number 301.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the conversion from base-11 to base-15 was successful, and the base-15 equivalent of the base-11 number 301 is 194.\n\nLet's break down the process to ensure the conversion is correct:\n\n1. **Convert from base-11 to base-10:**\n   - The base-11 number 301 is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 11^2 + 0 \\times 11^1 + 1 \\times 11^0 = 3 \\times 121 + 0 \\times 11 + 1 \\times 1 = 363 + 0 + 1 = 364\n     \\]\n\n2. **Convert from base-10 to base-15:**\n   - Divide 364 by 15:\n     - 364 รท 15 = 24 remainder 4\n     - 24 รท 15 = 1 remainder 9\n     - 1 รท 15 = 0 remainder 1\n   - Reading the remainders from last to first gives us 194 in base-15.\n\nThe conversion process and the result are correct. Therefore, the base-15 equivalent of the base-11 number 301 is indeed 194.\n\n<<<'194'>>>"
