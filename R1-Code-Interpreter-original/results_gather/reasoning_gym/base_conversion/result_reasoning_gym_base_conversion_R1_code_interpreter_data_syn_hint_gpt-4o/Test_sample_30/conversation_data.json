    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the number from the original base to base-10 (decimal):**\n   - For a base-11 number like 794, each digit is multiplied by 11 raised to the power of its position index (from right to left, starting at 0).\n   - Calculate the decimal equivalent of 794 in base-11.\n\n2. **Convert the decimal number to the target base (base-4 in this case):**\n   - Repeatedly divide the decimal number by the target base (4) and keep track of the remainders.\n   - The remainders, read in reverse order, give the digits of the number in the target base.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-11 number 794 to decimal\nbase_11_number = \"794\"\nbase_11 = 11\n\n# Convert to decimal\ndecimal_number = 0\nfor index, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_11_number)):\n    decimal_number += int(digit) * (base_11 ** index)\n\n# Step 2: Convert decimal number to base-4\nbase_4 = 4\nbase_4_number = \"\"\n\nwhile decimal_number > 0:\n    remainder = decimal_number % base_4\n    base_4_number = str(remainder) + base_4_number\n    decimal_number //= base_4\n\nprint(base_4_number)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the base-4 equivalent of the base-11 number 794.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the conversion process was successful, and the base-4 equivalent of the base-11 number 794 is 32312. \n\nThe process involved:\n1. Converting the base-11 number to a decimal (base-10) number.\n2. Converting the resulting decimal number to base-4.\n\nThe steps were implemented correctly, and the output matches the expected result for the conversion.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<'answer'>>> 32312"
