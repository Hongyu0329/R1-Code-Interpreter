    "To convert a number from base-8 (octal) to base-10 (decimal), we need to understand the positional value of each digit in the base-8 number. Each digit in a base-8 number represents a power of 8, starting from the rightmost digit which is 8^0.\n\nThe base-8 number 426 can be broken down as follows:\n\n- The rightmost digit (6) is in the 8^0 place.\n- The middle digit (2) is in the 8^1 place.\n- The leftmost digit (4) is in the 8^2 place.\n\nTo convert this to base-10, we calculate the value of each digit multiplied by its positional value and sum them up:\n\n- 4 * (8^2) = 4 * 64 = 256\n- 2 * (8^1) = 2 * 8 = 16\n- 6 * (8^0) = 6 * 1 = 6\n\nAdding these values together gives us the base-10 equivalent.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Base-8 number\noctal_number = \"426\"\n\n# Convert to base-10\ndecimal_number = int(octal_number, 8)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(decimal_number)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the base-10 equivalent of the base-8 number 426.",
    "The code execution result is correct, and the base-10 equivalent of the base-8 number 426 is indeed 278. The process of converting from base-8 to base-10 involves calculating the sum of each digit multiplied by its respective power of 8, which was correctly implemented in the code.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<'278'>>>"
