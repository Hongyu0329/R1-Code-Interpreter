    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the original number to a decimal (base-10) number**: This involves interpreting the number in its original base and calculating its equivalent in base-10.\n\n2. **Convert the decimal number to the target base**: Once we have the decimal equivalent, we can convert it to the desired base by repeatedly dividing the number by the target base and recording the remainders.\n\nLet's apply these steps to convert the binary number `1001001010` to base-11.\n\n### Step 1: Convert binary to decimal\n\nThe binary number `1001001010` can be converted to decimal by evaluating it as follows:\n\n- \\(1 \\times 2^9 + 0 \\times 2^8 + 0 \\times 2^7 + 1 \\times 2^6 + 0 \\times 2^5 + 0 \\times 2^4 + 1 \\times 2^3 + 0 \\times 2^2 + 1 \\times 2^1 + 0 \\times 2^0\\)\n\n### Step 2: Convert decimal to base-11\n\nOnce we have the decimal equivalent, we can convert it to base-11 by dividing the number by 11 and keeping track of the remainders.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert binary to decimal\nbinary_number = '1001001010'\ndecimal_number = int(binary_number, 2)\n\n# Step 2: Convert decimal to base-11\ndef decimal_to_base_n(decimal, base):\n    if decimal == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while decimal:\n        remainder = decimal % base\n        if remainder >= 10:\n            # Convert remainder to corresponding letter for bases > 10\n            digits.append(chr(remainder - 10 + ord('a')))\n        else:\n            digits.append(str(remainder))\n        decimal //= base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\nbase_11_number = decimal_to_base_n(decimal_number, 11)\nprint(base_11_number)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the base-11 equivalent of the binary number `1001001010`.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the binary number `1001001010` has been successfully converted to the base-11 number `493`. \n\nLet's verify the steps to ensure the conversion is correct:\n\n1. **Binary to Decimal Conversion**:\n   - The binary number `1001001010` is equivalent to:\n     - \\(1 \\times 2^9 + 0 \\times 2^8 + 0 \\times 2^7 + 1 \\times 2^6 + 0 \\times 2^5 + 0 \\times 2^4 + 1 \\times 2^3 + 0 \\times 2^2 + 1 \\times 2^1 + 0 \\times 2^0\\)\n     - This evaluates to \\(512 + 0 + 0 + 64 + 0 + 0 + 8 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 586\\).\n\n2. **Decimal to Base-11 Conversion**:\n   - Convert 586 to base-11:\n     - 586 divided by 11 gives a quotient of 53 and a remainder of 3.\n     - 53 divided by 11 gives a quotient of 4 and a remainder of 9.\n     - 4 divided by 11 gives a quotient of 0 and a remainder of 4.\n   - Reading the remainders from last to first gives us `493` in base-11.\n\nThe conversion process and the result are correct. Therefore, the base-11 equivalent of the binary number `1001001010` is `493`.\n\n<<<answer>>>493<<<answer>>>"
