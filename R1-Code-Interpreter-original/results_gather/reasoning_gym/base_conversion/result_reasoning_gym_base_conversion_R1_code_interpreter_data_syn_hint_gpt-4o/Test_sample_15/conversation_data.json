    "To convert a number from base-3 to base-8, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the base-3 number to a base-10 number**: This involves multiplying each digit of the base-3 number by 3 raised to the power of its position index (starting from 0 from the right) and summing the results.\n\n2. **Convert the base-10 number to base-8**: This involves repeatedly dividing the base-10 number by 8 and recording the remainders. The base-8 number is obtained by reading the remainders in reverse order.\n\nLet's perform these steps using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-3 to base-10\nbase_3_number = '111100'\nbase_10_number = 0\n\n# Convert base-3 to base-10\nfor index, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_3_number)):\n    base_10_number += int(digit) * (3 ** index)\n\n# Step 2: Convert base-10 to base-8\nbase_8_number = ''\nwhile base_10_number > 0:\n    remainder = base_10_number % 8\n    base_8_number = str(remainder) + base_8_number\n    base_10_number //= 8\n\nprint(base_8_number)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the base-8 equivalent of the base-3 number 111100.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the base-8 equivalent of the base-3 number 111100 is 550. Let's verify the steps to ensure the conversion is correct:\n\n1. **Convert base-3 to base-10**:\n   - The base-3 number 111100 can be expanded as:\n     \\[\n     1 \\times 3^5 + 1 \\times 3^4 + 1 \\times 3^3 + 1 \\times 3^2 + 0 \\times 3^1 + 0 \\times 3^0\n     \\]\n   - Calculating each term:\n     - \\(1 \\times 3^5 = 243\\)\n     - \\(1 \\times 3^4 = 81\\)\n     - \\(1 \\times 3^3 = 27\\)\n     - \\(1 \\times 3^2 = 9\\)\n     - \\(0 \\times 3^1 = 0\\)\n     - \\(0 \\times 3^0 = 0\\)\n   - Summing these values gives: \\(243 + 81 + 27 + 9 = 360\\)\n\n2. **Convert base-10 to base-8**:\n   - Divide 360 by 8:\n     - \\(360 \\div 8 = 45\\) remainder \\(0\\)\n     - \\(45 \\div 8 = 5\\) remainder \\(5\\)\n     - \\(5 \\div 8 = 0\\) remainder \\(5\\)\n   - Reading the remainders from last to first gives the base-8 number: 550\n\nThe conversion steps are correct, and the base-8 equivalent of the base-3 number 111100 is indeed 550.\n\n<<<'550'>>>"
