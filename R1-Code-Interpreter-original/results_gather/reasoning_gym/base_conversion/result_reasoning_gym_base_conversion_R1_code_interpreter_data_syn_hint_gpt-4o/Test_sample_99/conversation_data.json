    "To convert a number from base-7 to base-14, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the base-7 number to a decimal (base-10) number.**\n   - Each digit in the base-7 number represents a power of 7.\n   - For example, the number 641 in base-7 can be expanded as:\n     \\[\n     6 \\times 7^2 + 4 \\times 7^1 + 1 \\times 7^0\n     \\]\n\n2. **Convert the decimal number to base-14.**\n   - Divide the decimal number by 14 and keep track of the remainders.\n   - The remainders represent the digits in the base-14 number, starting from the least significant digit.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-7 number to decimal\nbase_7_number = \"641\"\ndecimal_number = 0\nbase_7_length = len(base_7_number)\n\nfor i in range(base_7_length):\n    digit = int(base_7_number[i])\n    power = base_7_length - i - 1\n    decimal_number += digit * (7 ** power)\n\n# Step 2: Convert decimal number to base-14\nbase_14_number = \"\"\nwhile decimal_number > 0:\n    remainder = decimal_number % 14\n    if remainder >= 10:\n        # Convert remainder to corresponding letter for base > 10\n        base_14_number = chr(remainder - 10 + ord('a')) + base_14_number\n    else:\n        base_14_number = str(remainder) + base_14_number\n    decimal_number //= 14\n\nprint(base_14_number)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the base-14 equivalent of the base-7 number 641.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the base-14 equivalent of the base-7 number 641 is 191. This result is consistent with the expected conversion process. \n\nTo ensure the accuracy of the conversion, let's briefly review the steps:\n\n1. **Convert 641 from base-7 to decimal:**\n   - \\(6 \\times 7^2 + 4 \\times 7^1 + 1 \\times 7^0 = 6 \\times 49 + 4 \\times 7 + 1 \\times 1 = 294 + 28 + 1 = 323\\)\n\n2. **Convert 323 from decimal to base-14:**\n   - Divide 323 by 14: quotient = 23, remainder = 1\n   - Divide 23 by 14: quotient = 1, remainder = 9\n   - Divide 1 by 14: quotient = 0, remainder = 1\n   - The remainders, read in reverse order, give the base-14 number: 191\n\nThe conversion process confirms that the base-14 equivalent of the base-7 number 641 is indeed 191.\n\n<<<'191'>>>"
