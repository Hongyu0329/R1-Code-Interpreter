    "To convert a number from base-11 to hexadecimal (base-16), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the base-11 number to a decimal number.**\n   - The base-11 number 397 can be expanded as:\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 11^2 + 9 \\times 11^1 + 7 \\times 11^0\n     \\]\n\n2. **Convert the decimal number to a hexadecimal number.**\n   - Once we have the decimal equivalent, we can convert it to hexadecimal by repeatedly dividing the number by 16 and recording the remainders.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-11 number to decimal\nbase_11_number = \"397\"\ndecimal_number = 0\nbase = 11\n\n# Calculate the decimal equivalent\nfor i, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_11_number)):\n    decimal_number += int(digit) * (base ** i)\n\n# Step 2: Convert decimal number to hexadecimal\nhexadecimal_number = \"\"\nhex_digits = \"0123456789abcdef\"\n\nwhile decimal_number > 0:\n    remainder = decimal_number % 16\n    hexadecimal_number = hex_digits[remainder] + hexadecimal_number\n    decimal_number //= 16\n\nprint(hexadecimal_number)\n```\n\nThis code will convert the base-11 number 397 to its hexadecimal equivalent. Let's execute it to find the result.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the conversion from base-11 to hexadecimal was successful, yielding the result \"1d5\". This means the base-11 number 397 is equivalent to the hexadecimal number 1d5.\n\nTo ensure the correctness of the conversion, let's briefly verify the steps:\n\n1. **Convert base-11 to decimal:**\n   - \\(3 \\times 11^2 = 3 \\times 121 = 363\\)\n   - \\(9 \\times 11^1 = 9 \\times 11 = 99\\)\n   - \\(7 \\times 11^0 = 7 \\times 1 = 7\\)\n   - Total in decimal = \\(363 + 99 + 7 = 469\\)\n\n2. **Convert decimal to hexadecimal:**\n   - 469 divided by 16 gives a quotient of 29 and a remainder of 5 (5 in hex is '5').\n   - 29 divided by 16 gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 13 (13 in hex is 'd').\n   - 1 divided by 16 gives a quotient of 0 and a remainder of 1 (1 in hex is '1').\n\nReading the remainders from last to first gives us the hexadecimal number 1d5.\n\nThe conversion is correct, and the final answer is:\n\n<<<'1d5'>>>"
