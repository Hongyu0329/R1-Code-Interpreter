    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the number from the original base to base-10 (decimal):**\n   - For a number in base-11, each digit represents a power of 11. \n   - The number 204 in base-11 can be expanded as: \\(2 \\times 11^2 + 0 \\times 11^1 + 4 \\times 11^0\\).\n\n2. **Convert the base-10 number to the target base (base-3 in this case):**\n   - Repeatedly divide the base-10 number by the target base (3) and keep track of the remainders.\n   - The remainders, read in reverse order, will give the number in the target base.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-11 number 204 to base-10\nbase_11_number = \"204\"\nbase_11 = 11\n\n# Convert to base-10\nbase_10_number = 0\nfor i, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_11_number)):\n    base_10_number += int(digit) * (base_11 ** i)\n\n# Step 2: Convert base-10 number to base-3\nbase_3 = 3\nbase_3_number = \"\"\n\nwhile base_10_number > 0:\n    remainder = base_10_number % base_3\n    base_3_number = str(remainder) + base_3_number\n    base_10_number //= base_3\n\nprint(base_3_number)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the base-3 equivalent of the base-11 number 204.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the base-3 equivalent of the base-11 number 204 is `100010`.\n\n<<<100010>>>"
