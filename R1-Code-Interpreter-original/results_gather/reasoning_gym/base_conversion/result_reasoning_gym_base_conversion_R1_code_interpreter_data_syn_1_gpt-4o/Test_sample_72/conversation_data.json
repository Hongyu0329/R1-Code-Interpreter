    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the original number to a decimal (base-10) number.**\n   - The given number is in binary (base-2), so we need to convert it to decimal first.\n   - Each digit in a binary number represents a power of 2, starting from the rightmost digit which is 2^0.\n\n2. **Convert the decimal number to the target base (base-15 in this case).**\n   - Once we have the decimal equivalent, we can convert it to the desired base by repeatedly dividing the number by the base and recording the remainders.\n\nLet's perform these steps using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert binary to decimal\nbinary_number = '1111010110'\ndecimal_number = int(binary_number, 2)\n\n# Step 2: Convert decimal to base-15\ndef decimal_to_base_n(decimal, base):\n    if decimal == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while decimal:\n        remainder = decimal % base\n        if remainder >= 10:\n            # Convert remainder to corresponding letter for bases > 10\n            digits.append(chr(remainder - 10 + ord('a')))\n        else:\n            digits.append(str(remainder))\n        decimal //= base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\nbase_15_number = decimal_to_base_n(decimal_number, 15)\nprint(base_15_number)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the base-15 representation of the binary number 1111010110.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is `457`. This means that the binary number `1111010110` converts to `457` in base-15.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<457>>>"
