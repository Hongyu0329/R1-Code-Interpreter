    "To convert a number from base-3 to base-8, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the base-3 number to a base-10 number**: This is done by multiplying each digit of the base-3 number by 3 raised to the power of its position index (starting from 0 from the right) and summing the results.\n\n2. **Convert the base-10 number to a base-8 number**: This involves repeatedly dividing the base-10 number by 8 and recording the remainders. The base-8 number is the sequence of remainders read in reverse order.\n\nLet's implement this process in Python to find the base-8 equivalent of the base-3 number 111100.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-3 to base-10\nbase_3_number = '111100'\nbase_10_number = 0\n\n# Convert base-3 to base-10\nfor index, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_3_number)):\n    base_10_number += int(digit) * (3 ** index)\n\n# Step 2: Convert base-10 to base-8\nbase_8_number = ''\nwhile base_10_number > 0:\n    remainder = base_10_number % 8\n    base_8_number = str(remainder) + base_8_number\n    base_10_number //= 8\n\nprint(base_8_number)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the base-8 equivalent of the base-3 number 111100.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the base-8 equivalent of the base-3 number 111100 is 550.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<550>>>"
