    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the number from the original base to base 10 (decimal).**\n2. **Convert the base 10 number to the target base.**\n\nLet's apply these steps to convert the base-13 number `129` to base-11.\n\n### Step 1: Convert from base-13 to base-10\n\nThe base-13 number `129` can be expanded as:\n\\[ 1 \\times 13^2 + 2 \\times 13^1 + 9 \\times 13^0 \\]\n\nLet's calculate this value in base-10.\n\n### Step 2: Convert from base-10 to base-11\n\nOnce we have the base-10 equivalent, we will convert it to base-11 by repeatedly dividing the number by 11 and recording the remainders.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-13 to base-10\nbase_13_number = \"129\"\nbase_10_number = int(base_13_number, 13)\n\n# Step 2: Convert base-10 to base-11\ndef convert_to_base_11(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return \"0\"\n    digits = []\n    while n:\n        digits.append(int(n % 11))\n        n //= 11\n    # Convert digits to appropriate base-11 representation\n    base_11_number = ''.join(str(d) if d < 10 else chr(d - 10 + ord('a')) for d in reversed(digits))\n    return base_11_number\n\nbase_11_number = convert_to_base_11(base_10_number)\nprint(base_11_number)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the base-11 equivalent of the base-13 number `129`.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the base-11 equivalent of the base-13 number `129` is `176`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<176>>>"
