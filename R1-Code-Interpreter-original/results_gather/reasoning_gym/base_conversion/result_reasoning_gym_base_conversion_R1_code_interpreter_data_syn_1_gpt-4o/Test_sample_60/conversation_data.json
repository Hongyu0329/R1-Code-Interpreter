    "To convert a number from base-10 to another base, we can use the method of successive division. This involves dividing the number by the target base and keeping track of the remainders. The remainders, read in reverse order, give the digits of the number in the new base.\n\nFor this problem, we need to convert the base-10 number 431 to base-11. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Divide 431 by 11 and record the remainder.\n2. Use the quotient from the previous division as the new number to divide by 11.\n3. Repeat the process until the quotient is 0.\n4. The remainders, read in reverse order, will give us the number in base-11.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the result.\n\n```python\ndef convert_base_10_to_base_n(number, base):\n    if number == 0:\n        return \"0\"\n    \n    digits = []\n    while number:\n        remainder = number % base\n        if remainder >= 10:\n            # Convert remainder to corresponding letter for bases > 10\n            digits.append(chr(remainder - 10 + ord('a')))\n        else:\n            digits.append(str(remainder))\n        number //= base\n    \n    # The digits are in reverse order\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\n# Convert 431 from base-10 to base-11\nresult = convert_base_10_to_base_n(431, 11)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the base-11 representation of 431.",
    "The code has successfully executed and provided the output. The base-11 representation of the base-10 number 431 is \"362\". \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<362>>>"
