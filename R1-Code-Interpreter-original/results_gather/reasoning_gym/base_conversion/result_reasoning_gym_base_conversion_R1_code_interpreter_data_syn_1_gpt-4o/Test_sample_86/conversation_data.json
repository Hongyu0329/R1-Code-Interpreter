    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the number from the original base to base-10 (decimal):**\n   - For a base-12 number, each digit represents a power of 12. \n   - The number 508 in base-12 can be broken down as follows:\n     - \\(5 \\times 12^2 + 0 \\times 12^1 + 8 \\times 12^0\\)\n\n2. **Convert the base-10 number to the target base (base-4 in this case):**\n   - Repeatedly divide the base-10 number by the target base (4) and keep track of the remainders.\n   - The remainders, read in reverse order, will give the number in the target base.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-12 number 508 to base-10\nbase_12_number = \"508\"\nbase_12 = 12\n\n# Convert base-12 to base-10\nbase_10_number = 0\nfor i, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_12_number)):\n    base_10_number += int(digit) * (base_12 ** i)\n\n# Step 2: Convert base-10 number to base-4\nbase_4 = 4\nbase_4_number = \"\"\n\nwhile base_10_number > 0:\n    remainder = base_10_number % base_4\n    base_4_number = str(remainder) + base_4_number\n    base_10_number //= base_4\n\nprint(base_4_number)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the base-4 equivalent of the base-12 number 508.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the base-4 equivalent of the base-12 number 508 is 23120.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<23120>>>"
