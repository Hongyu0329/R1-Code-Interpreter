    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the number from the original base to base-10 (decimal).\n2. Convert the base-10 number to the target base.\n\nLet's apply this to the problem:\n\n1. **Convert the base-6 number 4125 to base-10:**\n\n   The base-6 number 4125 can be expanded as:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 6^3 + 1 \\times 6^2 + 2 \\times 6^1 + 5 \\times 6^0\n   \\]\n\n2. **Convert the resulting base-10 number to base-5:**\n\n   Once we have the base-10 equivalent, we can convert it to base-5 by repeatedly dividing the number by 5 and recording the remainders.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the final result.\n\n```python\n# Convert base-6 number 4125 to base-10\nbase_6_number = \"4125\"\nbase_10_number = 0\nbase_6_number_reversed = base_6_number[::-1]\n\nfor i, digit in enumerate(base_6_number_reversed):\n    base_10_number += int(digit) * (6 ** i)\n\n# Convert base-10 number to base-5\nbase_5_number = \"\"\nwhile base_10_number > 0:\n    remainder = base_10_number % 5\n    base_5_number = str(remainder) + base_5_number\n    base_10_number //= 5\n\nprint(base_5_number)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the base-5 equivalent of the base-6 number 4125.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the base-5 equivalent of the base-6 number 4125 is 12132.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<12132>>>"
