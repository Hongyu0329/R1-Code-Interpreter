    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the base-7 number to a decimal (base-10) number.**\n2. **Convert the decimal number to the target base, which is base-14 in this case.**\n\n### Step 1: Convert from base-7 to base-10\n\nThe base-7 number 641 can be expanded as:\n\\[ 641_{7} = 6 \\times 7^2 + 4 \\times 7^1 + 1 \\times 7^0 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Convert from base-10 to base-14\n\nOnce we have the decimal equivalent, we can convert it to base-14 by repeatedly dividing the number by 14 and recording the remainders.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the final result.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-7 to base-10\nbase_7_number = \"641\"\nbase_10_number = 0\nbase_7_length = len(base_7_number)\n\nfor i in range(base_7_length):\n    digit = int(base_7_number[i])\n    power = base_7_length - i - 1\n    base_10_number += digit * (7 ** power)\n\n# Step 2: Convert base-10 to base-14\nbase_14_number = \"\"\nwhile base_10_number > 0:\n    remainder = base_10_number % 14\n    if remainder >= 10:\n        # Convert remainder to corresponding letter\n        base_14_number = chr(remainder - 10 + ord('a')) + base_14_number\n    else:\n        base_14_number = str(remainder) + base_14_number\n    base_10_number //= 14\n\nprint(base_14_number)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the base-14 equivalent of the base-7 number 641.",
