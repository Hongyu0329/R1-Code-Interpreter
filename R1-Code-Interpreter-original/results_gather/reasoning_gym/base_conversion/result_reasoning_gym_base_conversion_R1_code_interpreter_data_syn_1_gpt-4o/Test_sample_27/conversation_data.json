    "To convert a number from base-3 to hexadecimal, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the base-3 number to a decimal number.**\n   - Each digit in the base-3 number represents a power of 3, starting from the rightmost digit which is 3^0.\n   - Multiply each digit by its corresponding power of 3 and sum them up to get the decimal equivalent.\n\n2. **Convert the decimal number to a hexadecimal number.**\n   - Divide the decimal number by 16 and keep track of the remainders.\n   - The remainders represent the digits of the hexadecimal number, starting from the least significant digit.\n\nLet's implement this process in Python to find the hexadecimal equivalent of the base-3 number 22111.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-3 number to decimal\nbase_3_number = '22111'\ndecimal_number = 0\nbase = 3\n\n# Convert base-3 to decimal\nfor i, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_3_number)):\n    decimal_number += int(digit) * (base ** i)\n\n# Step 2: Convert decimal number to hexadecimal\nhexadecimal_number = ''\nhex_digits = '0123456789abcdef'\n\nwhile decimal_number > 0:\n    remainder = decimal_number % 16\n    hexadecimal_number = hex_digits[remainder] + hexadecimal_number\n    decimal_number //= 16\n\n# If the number is 0, the hexadecimal representation is also 0\nif not hexadecimal_number:\n    hexadecimal_number = '0'\n\nprint(hexadecimal_number)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the hexadecimal equivalent of the base-3 number 22111.",
    "The code executed successfully and converted the base-3 number 22111 to its hexadecimal equivalent. The output is `e5`.\n\nTherefore, the hexadecimal representation of the base-3 number 22111 is:\n\n<<<e5>>>"
