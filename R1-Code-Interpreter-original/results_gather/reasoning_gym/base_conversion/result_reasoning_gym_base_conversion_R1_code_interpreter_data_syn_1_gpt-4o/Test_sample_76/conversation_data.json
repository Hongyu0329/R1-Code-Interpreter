    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the number from the original base to base 10 (decimal):**\n   - Each digit in the number is multiplied by the base raised to the power of the position index (starting from 0 on the right).\n   - Sum all these values to get the decimal equivalent.\n\n2. **Convert the decimal number to the target base:**\n   - Divide the decimal number by the target base and keep track of the remainders.\n   - The remainders, read in reverse order, give the digits of the number in the target base.\n\nLet's apply this to convert the base-13 number \"a3\" to base-15.\n\n### Step 1: Convert \"a3\" from base-13 to decimal\n- \"a\" in base-13 is equivalent to 10 in decimal.\n- The number \"a3\" in base-13 can be expanded as: \\(10 \\times 13^1 + 3 \\times 13^0\\).\n\n### Step 2: Convert the decimal number to base-15\n- Use the division-remainder method to convert the decimal number to base-15.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the result.\n\n```python\n# Convert base-13 number 'a3' to decimal\nbase_13_number = 'a3'\nbase_13 = 13\n\n# Convert to decimal\ndecimal_value = 0\nfor index, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_13_number)):\n    if digit.isdigit():\n        value = int(digit)\n    else:\n        value = ord(digit) - ord('a') + 10\n    decimal_value += value * (base_13 ** index)\n\n# Convert decimal to base-15\nbase_15 = 15\nbase_15_number = ''\nwhile decimal_value > 0:\n    remainder = decimal_value % base_15\n    if remainder < 10:\n        base_15_number = str(remainder) + base_15_number\n    else:\n        base_15_number = chr(remainder - 10 + ord('a')) + base_15_number\n    decimal_value //= base_15\n\nprint(base_15_number)\n```\n\nThis code will convert the base-13 number \"a3\" to its equivalent in base-15. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and converted the base-13 number \"a3\" to base-15, resulting in \"8d\". \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<8d>>>"
