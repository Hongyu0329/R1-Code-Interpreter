    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the number from the original base to base-10 (decimal):**\n   - The binary number `1001001010` can be converted to decimal by evaluating each bit's contribution based on its position.\n\n2. **Convert the decimal number to the target base (base-11 in this case):**\n   - Once we have the decimal equivalent, we can convert it to base-11 by repeatedly dividing the number by 11 and recording the remainders.\n\nLet's perform these steps using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert binary to decimal\nbinary_number = '1001001010'\ndecimal_number = int(binary_number, 2)\n\n# Step 2: Convert decimal to base-11\ndef decimal_to_base_n(decimal, base):\n    if decimal == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while decimal:\n        remainder = decimal % base\n        if remainder >= 10:\n            # Convert remainder to corresponding letter for bases > 10\n            digits.append(chr(remainder - 10 + ord('a')))\n        else:\n            digits.append(str(remainder))\n        decimal //= base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\nbase_11_number = decimal_to_base_n(decimal_number, 11)\nprint(base_11_number)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the base-11 representation of the binary number `1001001010`.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the binary number `1001001010` was converted to base-11, resulting in the number `493`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<493>>>"
