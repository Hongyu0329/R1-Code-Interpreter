    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the number from the original base to base-10 (decimal):**\n   - For a base-6 number like 125, we interpret it as \\(1 \\times 6^2 + 2 \\times 6^1 + 5 \\times 6^0\\).\n\n2. **Convert the base-10 number to the target base (base-3 in this case):**\n   - We repeatedly divide the base-10 number by the target base (3) and keep track of the remainders. The remainders, read in reverse order, give us the number in the target base.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the final result.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-6 number 125 to base-10\nbase_6_number = \"125\"\nbase_10_number = 0\nbase_6_number_reversed = base_6_number[::-1]\n\nfor i, digit in enumerate(base_6_number_reversed):\n    base_10_number += int(digit) * (6 ** i)\n\n# Step 2: Convert base-10 number to base-3\nbase_3_number = \"\"\nwhile base_10_number > 0:\n    remainder = base_10_number % 3\n    base_3_number = str(remainder) + base_3_number\n    base_10_number //= 3\n\nprint(base_3_number)\n```\n\nThis code will convert the base-6 number 125 to base-3. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the base-6 number 125 was converted to base-3 as 1222.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1222>>>"
