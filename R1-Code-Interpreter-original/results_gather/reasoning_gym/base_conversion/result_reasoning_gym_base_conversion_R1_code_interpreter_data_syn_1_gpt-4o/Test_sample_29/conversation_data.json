    "To convert a number from base-4 to base-10, we need to understand the positional value of each digit in the base-4 number. Each digit in a base-4 number represents a power of 4, starting from the rightmost digit which is 4^0, then 4^1, 4^2, and so on.\n\nThe base-4 number 13322 can be broken down as follows:\n\n- The rightmost digit (2) is in the 4^0 place.\n- The next digit (2) is in the 4^1 place.\n- The next digit (3) is in the 4^2 place.\n- The next digit (3) is in the 4^3 place.\n- The leftmost digit (1) is in the 4^4 place.\n\nTo convert this to base-10, we calculate the sum of each digit multiplied by its positional value:\n\n\\[ 1 \\times 4^4 + 3 \\times 4^3 + 3 \\times 4^2 + 2 \\times 4^1 + 2 \\times 4^0 \\]\n\nLet's compute this using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Base-4 number\nbase_4_number = \"13322\"\n\n# Convert base-4 to base-10\nbase_10_number = sum(int(digit) * (4 ** idx) for idx, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_4_number)))\n\nprint(base_10_number)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the base-10 equivalent of the base-4 number 13322.",
