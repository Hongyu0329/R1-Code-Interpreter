    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the number from the original base to base 10 (decimal).\n2. Convert the decimal number to the target base.\n\nLet's apply this to convert the hexadecimal number `4f` to base-5.\n\n### Step 1: Convert from Hexadecimal to Decimal\n\nThe hexadecimal number `4f` can be broken down as follows:\n- `4` in hexadecimal is `4` in decimal.\n- `f` in hexadecimal is `15` in decimal.\n\nThe value of `4f` in decimal is calculated as:\n\\[ 4 \\times 16^1 + 15 \\times 16^0 = 64 + 15 = 79 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Convert from Decimal to Base-5\n\nNow, we need to convert the decimal number `79` to base-5. We do this by repeatedly dividing the number by 5 and keeping track of the remainders.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this conversion:\n\n```python\ndef decimal_to_base5(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n:\n        digits.append(int(n % 5))\n        n //= 5\n    return ''.join(str(x) for x in digits[::-1])\n\n# Convert hexadecimal 4f to decimal\nhex_number = '4f'\ndecimal_number = int(hex_number, 16)\n\n# Convert decimal to base-5\nbase5_number = decimal_to_base5(decimal_number)\nprint(base5_number)\n```\n\nThis script will convert the decimal number `79` to base-5 and print the result. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the conversion from hexadecimal `4f` to base-5 resulted in `304`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<304>>>"
