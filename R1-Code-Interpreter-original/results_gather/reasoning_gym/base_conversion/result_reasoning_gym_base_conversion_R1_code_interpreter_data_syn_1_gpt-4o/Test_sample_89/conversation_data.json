    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the number from the original base to base-10 (decimal):**\n   - For a base-5 number like 324, we calculate its decimal equivalent by multiplying each digit by its base raised to the power of its position (from right to left, starting at 0).\n\n2. **Convert the base-10 number to the target base (base-11 in this case):**\n   - We repeatedly divide the base-10 number by the target base and keep track of the remainders. The remainders, read in reverse order, give us the number in the target base.\n\nLet's perform these steps using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-5 number 324 to base-10\nbase_5_number = '324'\nbase_5 = 5\ndecimal_number = 0\n\n# Calculate the decimal equivalent\nfor i, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_5_number)):\n    decimal_number += int(digit) * (base_5 ** i)\n\n# Step 2: Convert the decimal number to base-11\nbase_11 = 11\nbase_11_number = ''\n\n# Convert to base-11\nwhile decimal_number > 0:\n    remainder = decimal_number % base_11\n    if remainder >= 10:\n        # Convert remainder to a letter if it's 10 or more\n        base_11_number = chr(remainder - 10 + ord('a')) + base_11_number\n    else:\n        base_11_number = str(remainder) + base_11_number\n    decimal_number //= base_11\n\nprint(base_11_number)\n```\n\nThis code will output the base-11 equivalent of the base-5 number 324.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is `81`. This means that the base-5 number `324` is equivalent to `81` in base-11.\n\n<<<81>>>"
