    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the original number to base 10**: This involves interpreting the number in its original base and calculating its equivalent in base 10.\n\n2. **Convert the base 10 number to the target base**: Once we have the base 10 equivalent, we can convert it to the desired base by repeatedly dividing the number by the target base and recording the remainders.\n\nLet's apply this process to convert the base-14 number \"55\" to base-11.\n\n### Step 1: Convert base-14 number \"55\" to base-10\n\nThe base-14 number \"55\" can be interpreted as:\n\\[ 5 \\times 14^1 + 5 \\times 14^0 = 5 \\times 14 + 5 \\times 1 = 70 + 5 = 75 \\]\n\nSo, the base-10 equivalent of \"55\" in base-14 is 75.\n\n### Step 2: Convert base-10 number 75 to base-11\n\nNow, we need to convert 75 from base-10 to base-11. We do this by dividing 75 by 11 and keeping track of the remainders.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this conversion:\n\n```python\ndef convert_base_10_to_base_n(number, base):\n    if number == 0:\n        return \"0\"\n    digits = []\n    while number:\n        digits.append(int(number % base))\n        number //= base\n    return ''.join(str(x) for x in digits[::-1])\n\n# Base-10 number\nbase_10_number = 75\n\n# Convert to base-11\nbase_11_number = convert_base_10_to_base_n(base_10_number, 11)\nprint(base_11_number)\n```\n\nThis script will convert the base-10 number 75 to base-11 and print the result. Let's execute it to find the final answer.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is 69. This means that the base-14 number \"55\" is equivalent to \"69\" in base-11.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<69>>>"
