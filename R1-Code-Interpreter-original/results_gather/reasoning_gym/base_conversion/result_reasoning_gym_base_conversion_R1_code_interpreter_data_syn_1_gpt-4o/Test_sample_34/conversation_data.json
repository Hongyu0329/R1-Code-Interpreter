    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the number from the original base to base-10 (decimal):**\n   - For a base-6 number like 200, we interpret it as \\(2 \\times 6^2 + 0 \\times 6^1 + 0 \\times 6^0\\).\n\n2. **Convert the base-10 number to the target base (base-8 in this case):**\n   - We repeatedly divide the base-10 number by the target base (8) and keep track of the remainders. The remainders, read in reverse order, give us the number in the target base.\n\nLet's implement this process in Python to find the base-8 equivalent of the base-6 number 200.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-6 number 200 to base-10\nbase_6_number = \"200\"\nbase_10_number = int(base_6_number, 6)\n\n# Step 2: Convert base-10 number to base-8\nbase_8_number = \"\"\nwhile base_10_number > 0:\n    remainder = base_10_number % 8\n    base_8_number = str(remainder) + base_8_number\n    base_10_number //= 8\n\nprint(base_8_number)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the base-8 equivalent of the base-6 number 200.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the base-8 equivalent of the base-6 number 200 is 110.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<110>>>"
