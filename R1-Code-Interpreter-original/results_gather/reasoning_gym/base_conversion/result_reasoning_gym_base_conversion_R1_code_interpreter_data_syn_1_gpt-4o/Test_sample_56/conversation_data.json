    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the number from the original base to base-10 (decimal):**\n   - For a base-5 number like 3112, we calculate its decimal equivalent by multiplying each digit by 5 raised to the power of its position index (starting from 0 from the right).\n\n2. **Convert the decimal number to the target base (base-7 in this case):**\n   - We repeatedly divide the decimal number by the target base (7) and keep track of the remainders. The remainders, read in reverse order, give us the number in the target base.\n\nLet's perform these steps using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-5 number 3112 to decimal\nbase_5_number = '3112'\ndecimal_number = 0\nbase_5_length = len(base_5_number)\n\nfor i in range(base_5_length):\n    digit = int(base_5_number[base_5_length - i - 1])\n    decimal_number += digit * (5 ** i)\n\n# Step 2: Convert the decimal number to base-7\nbase_7_number = ''\nwhile decimal_number > 0:\n    remainder = decimal_number % 7\n    base_7_number = str(remainder) + base_7_number\n    decimal_number //= 7\n\nprint(base_7_number)\n```\n\nThis code will convert the base-5 number 3112 to its base-7 equivalent. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and converted the base-5 number 3112 to its base-7 equivalent. The result is 1121.\n\n<<<1121>>>"
