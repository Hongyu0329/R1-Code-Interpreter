    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the original number to base 10**: This involves interpreting the number in its original base and calculating its equivalent in base 10.\n\n2. **Convert the base 10 number to the target base**: Once we have the base 10 equivalent, we can convert it to the desired base by repeatedly dividing the number by the target base and recording the remainders.\n\nLet's apply these steps to convert the base-13 number \"b6\" to base-5.\n\n### Step 1: Convert \"b6\" from base-13 to base-10\n\n- The number \"b6\" in base-13 can be broken down as follows:\n  - 'b' in base-13 is equivalent to 11 in base-10.\n  - '6' in base-13 is equivalent to 6 in base-10.\n\n- The base-10 equivalent of \"b6\" is calculated as:\n  \\[\n  11 \\times 13^1 + 6 \\times 13^0 = 11 \\times 13 + 6 \\times 1 = 143 + 6 = 149\n  \\]\n\n### Step 2: Convert 149 from base-10 to base-5\n\nTo convert 149 to base-5, we repeatedly divide by 5 and record the remainders:\n\n- 149 รท 5 = 29 remainder 4\n- 29 รท 5 = 5 remainder 4\n- 5 รท 5 = 1 remainder 0\n- 1 รท 5 = 0 remainder 1\n\nReading the remainders from bottom to top gives us the base-5 number.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\ndef base13_to_base10(number):\n    base13_digits = '0123456789abc'\n    base10 = 0\n    for i, digit in enumerate(reversed(number)):\n        base10 += base13_digits.index(digit) * (13 ** i)\n    return base10\n\ndef base10_to_base5(number):\n    if number == 0:\n        return '0'\n    base5 = ''\n    while number > 0:\n        base5 = str(number % 5) + base5\n        number //= 5\n    return base5\n\n# Convert base-13 'b6' to base-10\nbase10_number = base13_to_base10('b6')\n\n# Convert base-10 number to base-5\nbase5_number = base10_to_base5(base10_number)\n\nprint(base5_number)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the base-5 equivalent of the base-13 number \"b6\".",
