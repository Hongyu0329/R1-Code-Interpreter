    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the number from the original base to decimal (base 10):**\n   - Each digit in the number is multiplied by the base raised to the power of its position index (starting from 0 on the right).\n   - Sum all these values to get the decimal equivalent.\n\n2. **Convert the decimal number to the target base:**\n   - Repeatedly divide the decimal number by the target base and record the remainders.\n   - The remainders, read in reverse order, give the number in the target base.\n\nLet's apply this to convert the base-14 number `41c` to binary:\n\n- **Step 1: Convert `41c` from base-14 to decimal:**\n  - `4 * 14^2 + 1 * 14^1 + 12 * 14^0`\n  - Here, `c` in base-14 is equivalent to `12` in decimal.\n\n- **Step 2: Convert the resulting decimal number to binary:**\n  - Use repeated division by 2 to get the binary representation.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the result.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-14 number '41c' to decimal\nbase_14_number = '41c'\nbase_14 = 14\n\n# Convert each digit to its decimal equivalent\ndecimal_value = 0\nfor index, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_14_number)):\n    if digit.isdigit():\n        value = int(digit)\n    else:\n        value = ord(digit) - ord('a') + 10\n    decimal_value += value * (base_14 ** index)\n\n# Step 2: Convert the decimal number to binary\nbinary_value = ''\nwhile decimal_value > 0:\n    binary_value = str(decimal_value % 2) + binary_value\n    decimal_value //= 2\n\nprint(binary_value)\n```\n\nThis code will convert the base-14 number `41c` to its binary equivalent. Let's execute it to find the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and converted the base-14 number `41c` to its binary equivalent. The binary representation of `41c` in base-14 is `1100101010`.\n\n<<<1100101010>>>"
