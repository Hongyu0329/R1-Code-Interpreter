    "To convert a number from base-8 to base-14, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the base-8 number to a base-10 number**: This is done by multiplying each digit of the base-8 number by 8 raised to the power of its position index (starting from 0 from the right).\n\n2. **Convert the base-10 number to base-14**: This involves repeatedly dividing the base-10 number by 14 and recording the remainders. The remainders, read in reverse order, give the digits of the base-14 number.\n\nLet's implement this process in Python:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-8 number to base-10\nbase_8_number = '1674'\nbase_10_number = 0\n\n# Convert base-8 to base-10\nfor i, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_8_number)):\n    base_10_number += int(digit) * (8 ** i)\n\n# Step 2: Convert base-10 number to base-14\nbase_14_number = ''\ndigits = '0123456789abcdef'\n\nwhile base_10_number > 0:\n    remainder = base_10_number % 14\n    base_14_number = digits[remainder] + base_14_number\n    base_10_number //= 14\n\nprint(base_14_number)\n```\n\nThis code will convert the base-8 number 1674 to its equivalent in base-14. Let's execute the code to find the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the base-8 number 1674 was converted to base-14 as 4c4.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<4c4>>>"
