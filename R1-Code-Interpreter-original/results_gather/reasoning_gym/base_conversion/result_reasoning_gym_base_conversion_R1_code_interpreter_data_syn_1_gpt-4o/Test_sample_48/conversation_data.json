    "To convert a number from base-8 (octal) to base-10 (decimal), we need to understand the positional value of each digit in the base-8 number. Each digit in a base-8 number represents a power of 8, starting from the rightmost digit which is 8^0.\n\nFor the base-8 number 426, the conversion to base-10 can be calculated as follows:\n\n- The rightmost digit (6) is in the 8^0 position.\n- The middle digit (2) is in the 8^1 position.\n- The leftmost digit (4) is in the 8^2 position.\n\nThe base-10 value is calculated by multiplying each digit by its positional value and summing the results:\n\n\\[ 426_{8} = 4 \\times 8^2 + 2 \\times 8^1 + 6 \\times 8^0 \\]\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Base-8 number\noctal_number = \"426\"\n\n# Convert base-8 to base-10\ndecimal_value = int(octal_number, 8)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(decimal_value)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the base-10 equivalent of the base-8 number 426.",
    "The code executed successfully and converted the base-8 number 426 to its base-10 equivalent, which is 278. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<278>>>"
