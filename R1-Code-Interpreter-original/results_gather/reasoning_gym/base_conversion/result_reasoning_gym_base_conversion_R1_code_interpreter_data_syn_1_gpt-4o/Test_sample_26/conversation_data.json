    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the number from the original base to base-10 (decimal):**\n   - Start from the rightmost digit, multiply each digit by the base raised to the power of its position index (starting from 0), and sum all these values.\n\n2. **Convert the base-10 number to the target base:**\n   - Divide the base-10 number by the target base and keep track of the remainders.\n   - The remainders, read in reverse order, give the digits of the number in the target base.\n\nLet's apply this process to convert the base-5 number 4334 to base-13.\n\n### Step 1: Convert from base-5 to base-10\n\nThe base-5 number 4334 can be expanded as:\n\\[ 4 \\times 5^3 + 3 \\times 5^2 + 3 \\times 5^1 + 4 \\times 5^0 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Convert from base-10 to base-13\n\nOnce we have the base-10 equivalent, we will convert it to base-13 by repeatedly dividing by 13 and recording the remainders.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-5 to base-10\nbase_5_number = \"4334\"\nbase_10_number = 0\nbase_5_number_reversed = base_5_number[::-1]\n\nfor i, digit in enumerate(base_5_number_reversed):\n    base_10_number += int(digit) * (5 ** i)\n\n# Step 2: Convert base-10 to base-13\nbase_13_number = \"\"\ncurrent_number = base_10_number\n\nwhile current_number > 0:\n    remainder = current_number % 13\n    if remainder >= 10:\n        # Convert remainder to corresponding letter\n        base_13_number = chr(remainder - 10 + ord('a')) + base_13_number\n    else:\n        base_13_number = str(remainder) + base_13_number\n    current_number //= 13\n\nprint(base_13_number)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the base-13 equivalent of the base-5 number 4334.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is `369`. This means that the base-5 number `4334` is equivalent to `369` in base-13.\n\n<<<369>>>"
