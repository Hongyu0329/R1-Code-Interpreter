    "To convert a number from base-9 to hexadecimal, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the base-9 number to a decimal number.**\n   - Each digit in the base-9 number is multiplied by 9 raised to the power of its position index (starting from 0 from the right).\n   - Sum these values to get the decimal equivalent.\n\n2. **Convert the decimal number to a hexadecimal number.**\n   - Divide the decimal number by 16 and keep track of the remainders.\n   - The remainders, read in reverse order, give the hexadecimal representation.\n\nLet's implement this process in Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-9 number to decimal\nbase_9_number = \"1002\"\ndecimal_number = 0\n\n# Convert base-9 to decimal\nfor index, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_9_number)):\n    decimal_number += int(digit) * (9 ** index)\n\n# Step 2: Convert decimal number to hexadecimal\nhexadecimal_number = \"\"\nhex_digits = \"0123456789abcdef\"\n\nwhile decimal_number > 0:\n    remainder = decimal_number % 16\n    hexadecimal_number = hex_digits[remainder] + hexadecimal_number\n    decimal_number //= 16\n\n# If the number is 0, we should return \"0\"\nif not hexadecimal_number:\n    hexadecimal_number = \"0\"\n\nprint(hexadecimal_number)\n```\n\nThis code will convert the base-9 number `1002` to its hexadecimal equivalent. Let's execute it to find the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and converted the base-9 number `1002` to its hexadecimal equivalent, which is `2db`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2db>>>"
