    "To convert a base-10 number to another base, we can use the method of successive division. Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Divide the number by the new base**: Divide the base-10 number by the target base (in this case, 13) and record the quotient and the remainder.\n\n2. **Record the remainder**: The remainder is the least significant digit (rightmost) in the new base.\n\n3. **Repeat the process**: Use the quotient from the previous division as the new number to divide by the target base. Continue this process until the quotient is zero.\n\n4. **Read the remainders in reverse order**: The remainders, read from last to first, give the number in the new base.\n\nLet's implement this process in Python to convert the number 418 from base-10 to base-13.\n\n```python\ndef convert_to_base(n, base):\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        remainder = n % base\n        if remainder >= 10:\n            # Convert remainder to corresponding letter for bases > 10\n            remainder = chr(remainder - 10 + ord('a'))\n        digits.append(str(remainder))\n        n = n // base\n    # The digits are in reverse order\n    return ''.join(digits[::-1])\n\n# Convert 418 from base-10 to base-13\nresult = convert_to_base(418, 13)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the base-13 representation of 418.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the base-13 representation of the base-10 number 418 is \"262\". \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<262>>>"
