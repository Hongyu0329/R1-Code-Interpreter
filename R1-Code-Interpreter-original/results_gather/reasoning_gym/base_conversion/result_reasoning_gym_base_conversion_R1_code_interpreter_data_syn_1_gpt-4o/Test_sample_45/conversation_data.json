    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the number from the original base to base-10 (decimal):**\n   - For a base-6 number like 3442, each digit represents a power of 6.\n   - Calculate the decimal equivalent by multiplying each digit by 6 raised to the power of its position (from right to left, starting at 0).\n\n2. **Convert the decimal number to the target base (base-7 in this case):**\n   - Divide the decimal number by the target base (7) and keep track of the remainders.\n   - The remainders, read in reverse order, will give the digits of the number in the target base.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the base-7 equivalent of the base-6 number 3442.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-6 number 3442 to decimal\nbase_6_number = \"3442\"\nbase_6 = 6\ndecimal_number = 0\n\n# Calculate the decimal equivalent\nfor i, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_6_number)):\n    decimal_number += int(digit) * (base_6 ** i)\n\n# Step 2: Convert the decimal number to base-7\nbase_7 = 7\nbase_7_number = \"\"\n\n# Calculate the base-7 equivalent\nwhile decimal_number > 0:\n    remainder = decimal_number % base_7\n    base_7_number = str(remainder) + base_7_number\n    decimal_number //= base_7\n\nprint(base_7_number)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the base-7 equivalent of the base-6 number 3442.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the base-7 equivalent of the base-6 number 3442 is 2246.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2246>>>"
