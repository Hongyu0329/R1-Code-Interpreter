    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the number from the original base to base 10 (decimal):**\n   - Start from the rightmost digit, multiply each digit by the base raised to the power of its position index (starting from 0), and sum all these values.\n\n2. **Convert the base 10 number to the target base:**\n   - Divide the number by the target base and keep track of the remainders. The remainders, read in reverse order, give the digits of the number in the new base.\n\nLet's apply this to convert the base-6 number 1243 to base-11.\n\n### Step 1: Convert from base-6 to base-10\n\nThe base-6 number 1243 can be expanded as:\n\\[ 1 \\times 6^3 + 2 \\times 6^2 + 4 \\times 6^1 + 3 \\times 6^0 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Convert from base-10 to base-11\n\nOnce we have the base-10 equivalent, we will convert it to base-11 by repeatedly dividing by 11 and recording the remainders.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Convert base-6 number 1243 to base-10\nbase_6_number = '1243'\nbase_10_number = sum(int(digit) * (6 ** idx) for idx, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_6_number)))\n\n# Convert base-10 number to base-11\nbase_11_number = ''\nwhile base_10_number > 0:\n    remainder = base_10_number % 11\n    if remainder >= 10:\n        # Convert remainder to corresponding letter for bases > 10\n        base_11_number = chr(remainder - 10 + ord('a')) + base_11_number\n    else:\n        base_11_number = str(remainder) + base_11_number\n    base_10_number //= 11\n\nprint(base_11_number)\n```\n\nThis code will output the base-11 equivalent of the base-6 number 1243.",
