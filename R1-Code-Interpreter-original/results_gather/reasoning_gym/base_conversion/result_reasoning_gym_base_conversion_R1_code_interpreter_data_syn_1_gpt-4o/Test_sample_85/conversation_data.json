    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the number from the original base to base-10 (decimal).\n2. Convert the base-10 number to the target base.\n\nLet's apply this process to convert the base-4 number 3311 to base-5.\n\n### Step 1: Convert from base-4 to base-10\n\nThe base-4 number 3311 can be expanded as:\n\\[ 3 \\times 4^3 + 3 \\times 4^2 + 1 \\times 4^1 + 1 \\times 4^0 \\]\n\nLet's calculate this value in base-10.\n\n### Step 2: Convert from base-10 to base-5\n\nOnce we have the base-10 equivalent, we will convert it to base-5 by repeatedly dividing the number by 5 and recording the remainders.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the result.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-4 to base-10\nbase_4_number = \"3311\"\nbase_10_number = sum(int(digit) * (4 ** idx) for idx, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_4_number)))\n\n# Step 2: Convert base-10 to base-5\nbase_5_number = \"\"\nwhile base_10_number > 0:\n    base_5_number = str(base_10_number % 5) + base_5_number\n    base_10_number //= 5\n\nprint(base_5_number)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the base-5 equivalent of the base-4 number 3311.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the base-5 equivalent of the base-4 number 3311 is 1440.\n\n<<<1440>>>"
