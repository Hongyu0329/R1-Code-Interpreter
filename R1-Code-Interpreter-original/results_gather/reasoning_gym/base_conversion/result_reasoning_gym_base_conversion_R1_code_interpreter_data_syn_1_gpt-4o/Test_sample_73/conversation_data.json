    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the number from the original base to base-10 (decimal):**\n   - Start from the rightmost digit, multiply each digit by the base raised to the power of its position index (starting from 0), and sum all these values.\n\n2. **Convert the base-10 number to the target base:**\n   - Divide the number by the target base and keep track of the remainders.\n   - The remainders, read in reverse order, give the digits of the number in the target base.\n\nLet's apply this process to convert the base-11 number `748` to base-7.\n\n### Step 1: Convert from base-11 to base-10\n\nThe base-11 number `748` can be broken down as:\n- \\(7 \\times 11^2 + 4 \\times 11^1 + 8 \\times 11^0\\)\n\n### Step 2: Convert from base-10 to base-7\n\nOnce we have the base-10 equivalent, we will convert it to base-7 by repeatedly dividing by 7 and recording the remainders.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the result.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-11 to base-10\nbase_11_number = \"748\"\nbase_11 = 11\n\n# Convert to base-10\nbase_10_number = 0\nfor index, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_11_number)):\n    base_10_number += int(digit) * (base_11 ** index)\n\n# Step 2: Convert base-10 to base-7\nbase_7 = 7\nbase_7_number = \"\"\n\nwhile base_10_number > 0:\n    remainder = base_10_number % base_7\n    base_7_number = str(remainder) + base_7_number\n    base_10_number //= base_7\n\nprint(base_7_number)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the base-7 equivalent of the base-11 number `748`.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the base-7 equivalent of the base-11 number `748` is `2423`.\n\n<<<2423>>>"
