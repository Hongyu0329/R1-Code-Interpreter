    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the number from the original base to base-10 (decimal):**\n   - Start from the rightmost digit, multiply each digit by the base raised to the power of its position index (starting from 0), and sum all these values.\n\n2. **Convert the base-10 number to the target base:**\n   - Divide the number by the target base and keep track of the remainders. The remainders, read in reverse order, give the digits of the number in the target base.\n\nLet's apply these steps to convert the base-4 number `32213` to base-9.\n\n### Step 1: Convert from base-4 to base-10\n\nThe base-4 number `32213` can be expanded as:\n\\[ 3 \\times 4^4 + 2 \\times 4^3 + 2 \\times 4^2 + 1 \\times 4^1 + 3 \\times 4^0 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Convert from base-10 to base-9\n\nOnce we have the base-10 equivalent, we will convert it to base-9 by repeatedly dividing by 9 and recording the remainders.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the base-9 equivalent.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-4 to base-10\nbase_4_number = '32213'\nbase_10_number = 0\nbase_4 = 4\n\n# Calculate base-10 equivalent\nfor index, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_4_number)):\n    base_10_number += int(digit) * (base_4 ** index)\n\n# Step 2: Convert base-10 to base-9\nbase_9_number = ''\nbase_9 = 9\n\n# Calculate base-9 equivalent\nwhile base_10_number > 0:\n    remainder = base_10_number % base_9\n    base_9_number = str(remainder) + base_9_number\n    base_10_number //= base_9\n\nprint(base_9_number)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the base-9 equivalent of the base-4 number `32213`.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the base-9 equivalent of the base-4 number `32213` is `1248`.\n\n<<<1248>>>"
