    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the number from the original base to base-10 (decimal):**\n   - Start from the rightmost digit, multiply each digit by the base raised to the power of its position index (starting from 0), and sum all these values.\n\n2. **Convert the base-10 number to the target base:**\n   - Divide the number by the target base and keep track of the remainders. The remainders, read in reverse order, give the digits of the number in the target base.\n\nLet's apply this process to convert the base-5 number 11314 to base-3.\n\n### Step 1: Convert from base-5 to base-10\n\nThe base-5 number 11314 can be converted to base-10 as follows:\n\n\\[ 11314_{5} = 1 \\times 5^4 + 1 \\times 5^3 + 3 \\times 5^2 + 1 \\times 5^1 + 4 \\times 5^0 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Convert from base-10 to base-3\n\nOnce we have the base-10 equivalent, we can convert it to base-3 by repeatedly dividing by 3 and recording the remainders.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the final result.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-5 to base-10\nbase_5_number = \"11314\"\nbase_10_number = 0\nbase_5_number_reversed = base_5_number[::-1]\n\nfor i, digit in enumerate(base_5_number_reversed):\n    base_10_number += int(digit) * (5 ** i)\n\n# Step 2: Convert base-10 to base-3\nbase_3_number = \"\"\nwhile base_10_number > 0:\n    remainder = base_10_number % 3\n    base_3_number = str(remainder) + base_3_number\n    base_10_number //= 3\n\nprint(base_3_number)\n```\n\nThis code will output the base-3 equivalent of the base-5 number 11314.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is `1010220`. This is the base-3 representation of the base-5 number `11314`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1010220>>>"
