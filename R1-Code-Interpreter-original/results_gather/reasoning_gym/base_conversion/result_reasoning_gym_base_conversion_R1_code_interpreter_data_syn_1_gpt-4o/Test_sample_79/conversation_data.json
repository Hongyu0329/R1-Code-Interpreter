    "To convert a number from base-5 to hexadecimal, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the base-5 number to a decimal number.**\n   - Each digit in the base-5 number represents a power of 5, starting from the rightmost digit which is 5^0.\n   - Multiply each digit by 5 raised to the power of its position (starting from 0) and sum them up to get the decimal equivalent.\n\n2. **Convert the decimal number to a hexadecimal number.**\n   - Divide the decimal number by 16 and keep track of the remainders.\n   - The remainders, read in reverse order, give the hexadecimal representation.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the result.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-5 number to decimal\nbase_5_number = \"11342\"\ndecimal_number = 0\nbase = 5\n\n# Convert base-5 to decimal\nfor i, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_5_number)):\n    decimal_number += int(digit) * (base ** i)\n\n# Step 2: Convert decimal to hexadecimal\nhexadecimal_number = \"\"\nhex_base = 16\nhex_digits = \"0123456789abcdef\"\n\nwhile decimal_number > 0:\n    remainder = decimal_number % hex_base\n    hexadecimal_number = hex_digits[remainder] + hexadecimal_number\n    decimal_number //= hex_base\n\nprint(hexadecimal_number)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the hexadecimal equivalent of the base-5 number 11342.",
