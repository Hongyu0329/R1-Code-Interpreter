    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the number from the original base to base 10 (decimal):**\n   - Each digit in the number is multiplied by the base raised to the power of its position index (starting from 0 on the right).\n   - Sum all these values to get the decimal equivalent.\n\n2. **Convert the decimal number to the target base:**\n   - Divide the decimal number by the target base and keep track of the remainders.\n   - The remainders, read in reverse order, give the digits of the number in the target base.\n\nLet's apply this to convert the base-11 number \"20a\" to base-14.\n\n### Step 1: Convert \"20a\" from base-11 to decimal\n\n- The number \"20a\" in base-11 can be broken down as:\n  - \\(2 \\times 11^2 + 0 \\times 11^1 + 10 \\times 11^0\\)\n  - Here, 'a' represents 10 in base-11.\n\n### Step 2: Convert the decimal number to base-14\n\n- Once we have the decimal equivalent, we will convert it to base-14 by dividing by 14 and recording the remainders.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-11 number \"20a\" to decimal\nbase_11_number = \"20a\"\nbase_11 = 11\n\n# Convert base-11 to decimal\ndecimal_value = 0\nfor index, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_11_number)):\n    if digit.isdigit():\n        value = int(digit)\n    else:\n        value = ord(digit) - ord('a') + 10\n    decimal_value += value * (base_11 ** index)\n\n# Step 2: Convert decimal to base-14\nbase_14 = 14\nbase_14_number = []\n\nwhile decimal_value > 0:\n    remainder = decimal_value % base_14\n    if remainder >= 10:\n        base_14_number.append(chr(remainder - 10 + ord('a')))\n    else:\n        base_14_number.append(str(remainder))\n    decimal_value //= base_14\n\n# The base-14 number is the reverse of the remainders collected\nbase_14_number.reverse()\nbase_14_result = ''.join(base_14_number)\n\nprint(base_14_result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the base-14 equivalent of the base-11 number \"20a\".",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is \"140\". This means that the base-11 number \"20a\" is equivalent to \"140\" in base-14.\n\n<<<140>>>"
