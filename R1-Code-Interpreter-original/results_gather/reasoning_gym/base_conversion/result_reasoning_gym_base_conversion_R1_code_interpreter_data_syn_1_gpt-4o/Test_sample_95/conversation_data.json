    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the number from the original base to decimal (base-10):**\n   - The hexadecimal number system is base-16, which means it uses 16 symbols: 0-9 and a-f, where 'a' represents 10, 'b' represents 11, ..., and 'f' represents 15.\n   - The number 2d in hexadecimal can be broken down as follows:\n     - \\(2 \\times 16^1 + d \\times 16^0\\)\n     - Here, 'd' in hexadecimal is equivalent to 13 in decimal.\n\n2. **Convert the decimal number to the target base (base-11):**\n   - Once we have the decimal equivalent, we can convert it to base-11 by repeatedly dividing the number by 11 and recording the remainders.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert hexadecimal '2d' to decimal\nhex_number = '2d'\ndecimal_number = int(hex_number, 16)\n\n# Step 2: Convert the decimal number to base-11\ndef decimal_to_base_n(decimal, base):\n    if decimal == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while decimal:\n        remainder = decimal % base\n        if remainder >= 10:\n            # Convert remainder to corresponding letter for bases > 10\n            digits.append(chr(remainder - 10 + ord('a')))\n        else:\n            digits.append(str(remainder))\n        decimal //= base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\nbase_11_number = decimal_to_base_n(decimal_number, 11)\nprint(base_11_number)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the base-11 equivalent of the hexadecimal number 2d.",
