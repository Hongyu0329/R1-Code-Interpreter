    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the original number to base 10**: This involves multiplying each digit of the original number by its base raised to the power of its position index (starting from 0 on the right).\n\n2. **Convert the base 10 number to the target base**: This involves repeatedly dividing the base 10 number by the target base and recording the remainders.\n\nLet's apply these steps to convert the base-6 number 554 to base-8.\n\n### Step 1: Convert base-6 number 554 to base-10\n\nThe base-6 number 554 can be expanded as:\n\\[ 5 \\times 6^2 + 5 \\times 6^1 + 4 \\times 6^0 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Convert the base-10 number to base-8\n\nOnce we have the base-10 equivalent, we will convert it to base-8 by dividing by 8 and recording the remainders.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the result.\n\n```python\n# Convert base-6 number 554 to base-10\nbase_6_number = '554'\nbase_10_number = sum(int(digit) * (6 ** idx) for idx, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_6_number)))\n\n# Convert base-10 number to base-8\nbase_8_number = ''\nwhile base_10_number > 0:\n    remainder = base_10_number % 8\n    base_8_number = str(remainder) + base_8_number\n    base_10_number //= 8\n\nprint(base_8_number)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to find the base-8 equivalent of the base-6 number 554.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the base-8 equivalent of the base-6 number 554 is 326.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<326>>>"
