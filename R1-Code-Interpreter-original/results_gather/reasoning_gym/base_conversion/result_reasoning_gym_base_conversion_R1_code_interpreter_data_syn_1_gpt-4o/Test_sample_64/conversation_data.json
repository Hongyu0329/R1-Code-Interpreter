    "To convert a number from base-7 to hexadecimal, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the base-7 number to a decimal number**: This involves multiplying each digit of the base-7 number by 7 raised to the power of its position index (starting from 0 from the right).\n\n2. **Convert the decimal number to hexadecimal**: This involves repeatedly dividing the decimal number by 16 and recording the remainders. The remainders, read in reverse order, give the hexadecimal representation.\n\nLet's perform these steps using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-7 number to decimal\nbase_7_number = \"1051\"\ndecimal_number = 0\nbase = 7\n\n# Convert base-7 to decimal\nfor index, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_7_number)):\n    decimal_number += int(digit) * (base ** index)\n\n# Step 2: Convert decimal number to hexadecimal\nhexadecimal_number = \"\"\nhex_base = 16\nhex_digits = \"0123456789abcdef\"\n\nwhile decimal_number > 0:\n    remainder = decimal_number % hex_base\n    hexadecimal_number = hex_digits[remainder] + hexadecimal_number\n    decimal_number //= hex_base\n\n# If the number is 0, the hexadecimal representation should be \"0\"\nif not hexadecimal_number:\n    hexadecimal_number = \"0\"\n\nprint(hexadecimal_number)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the hexadecimal representation of the base-7 number 1051.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is `17b`. This means that the base-7 number `1051` converts to the hexadecimal number `17b`.\n\n<<<17b>>>"
