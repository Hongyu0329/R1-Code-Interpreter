    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the number from the original base to base-10 (decimal):**\n   - For a base-7 number like 61, we interpret it as \\(6 \\times 7^1 + 1 \\times 7^0\\).\n\n2. **Convert the base-10 number to the target base (base-11 in this case):**\n   - We repeatedly divide the base-10 number by the target base (11) and keep track of the remainders. These remainders represent the digits of the number in the new base, starting from the least significant digit.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-7 number 61 to base-10\nbase_7_number = \"61\"\nbase_10_number = int(base_7_number, 7)\n\n# Step 2: Convert base-10 number to base-11\ndef convert_to_base_11(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return \"0\"\n    digits = []\n    while n:\n        digits.append(int(n % 11))\n        n //= 11\n    # Convert digits to appropriate base-11 representation\n    base_11_number = ''.join(str(d) if d < 10 else chr(d - 10 + ord('a')) for d in reversed(digits))\n    return base_11_number\n\nbase_11_number = convert_to_base_11(base_10_number)\nprint(base_11_number)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the base-11 representation of the base-7 number 61.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the base-11 representation of the base-7 number 61 is \"3a\". \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3a>>>"
