    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the number from the original base to base 10 (decimal):**\n   - Each digit in the number is multiplied by the base raised to the power of its position index (starting from 0 on the right).\n   - Sum all these values to get the decimal equivalent.\n\n2. **Convert the decimal number to the target base:**\n   - Divide the decimal number by the target base and keep track of the remainders.\n   - The remainders, read in reverse order, give the digits of the number in the target base.\n\nLet's apply this to convert the base-14 number \"5d\" to base-11.\n\n### Step 1: Convert \"5d\" from base-14 to decimal\n- \"5d\" in base-14 means:\n  - '5' is in the 14^1 position\n  - 'd' (which is 13 in decimal) is in the 14^0 position\n\nThe decimal value is calculated as:\n\\[ 5 \\times 14^1 + 13 \\times 14^0 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Convert the decimal number to base-11\n- Use the division-remainder method to convert the decimal number to base-11.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the result.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-14 to decimal\nbase_14_number = \"5d\"\nbase_14 = 14\n\n# Convert each digit to decimal\ndecimal_value = 0\nfor i, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_14_number)):\n    if digit.isdigit():\n        value = int(digit)\n    else:\n        value = ord(digit) - ord('a') + 10\n    decimal_value += value * (base_14 ** i)\n\n# Step 2: Convert decimal to base-11\nbase_11 = 11\nbase_11_number = \"\"\n\nwhile decimal_value > 0:\n    remainder = decimal_value % base_11\n    if remainder >= 10:\n        base_11_number = chr(remainder - 10 + ord('a')) + base_11_number\n    else:\n        base_11_number = str(remainder) + base_11_number\n    decimal_value //= base_11\n\nprint(base_11_number)\n```\n\nThis code will convert the base-14 number \"5d\" to its equivalent in base-11. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is \"76\". This means that the base-14 number \"5d\" is equivalent to \"76\" in base-11.\n\n<<<76>>>"
