    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the number from the original base to base-10 (decimal):**\n   - We need to interpret the number in its original base and convert it to a decimal number.\n   - For a base-13 number, each digit represents a power of 13.\n\n2. **Convert the base-10 number to the target base:**\n   - Once we have the decimal equivalent, we can convert it to the target base by repeatedly dividing the number by the target base and recording the remainders.\n\nLet's apply these steps to convert the base-13 number \"130\" to base-3.\n\n### Step 1: Convert base-13 to base-10\nThe base-13 number \"130\" can be broken down as:\n- \\(1 \\times 13^2 + 3 \\times 13^1 + 0 \\times 13^0\\)\n\n### Step 2: Convert the resulting base-10 number to base-3\nOnce we have the base-10 equivalent, we will convert it to base-3 by dividing by 3 and keeping track of the remainders.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the final result.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-13 to base-10\nbase_13_number = \"130\"\nbase_10_number = int(base_13_number, 13)\n\n# Step 2: Convert base-10 to base-3\ndef convert_to_base_3(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return \"0\"\n    digits = []\n    while n:\n        digits.append(int(n % 3))\n        n //= 3\n    return ''.join(str(x) for x in digits[::-1])\n\nbase_3_number = convert_to_base_3(base_10_number)\nprint(base_3_number)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the base-3 equivalent of the base-13 number \"130\".",
    "The code executed successfully, and the base-3 equivalent of the base-13 number \"130\" is \"21201\". \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<21201>>>"
