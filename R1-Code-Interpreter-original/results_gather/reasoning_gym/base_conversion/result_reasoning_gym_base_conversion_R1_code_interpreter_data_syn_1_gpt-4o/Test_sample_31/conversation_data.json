    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the number from the original base to base-10 (decimal):**\n   - For a base-9 number like 555, each digit represents a power of 9.\n   - The number 555 in base-9 can be expanded as: \\(5 \\times 9^2 + 5 \\times 9^1 + 5 \\times 9^0\\).\n\n2. **Convert the base-10 number to the target base (base-6 in this case):**\n   - We repeatedly divide the base-10 number by the target base (6) and keep track of the remainders.\n   - The remainders, read in reverse order, give us the number in the target base.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-9 number 555 to base-10\nbase_9_number = \"555\"\nbase_10_number = sum(int(digit) * (9 ** idx) for idx, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_9_number)))\n\n# Step 2: Convert base-10 number to base-6\nbase_6_number = \"\"\nwhile base_10_number > 0:\n    remainder = base_10_number % 6\n    base_6_number = str(remainder) + base_6_number\n    base_10_number //= 6\n\nprint(base_6_number)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to find the base-6 equivalent of the base-9 number 555.",
