    "To convert a base-10 number to another base, we can use the method of repeated division by the target base, keeping track of the remainders. These remainders represent the digits of the number in the new base, starting from the least significant digit (rightmost) to the most significant digit (leftmost).\n\nFor this problem, we need to convert the base-10 number 778 to base-13. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Divide the number by the new base (13) and record the remainder.\n2. Update the number to be the quotient of the division.\n3. Repeat the process until the quotient is zero.\n4. The remainders collected, in reverse order, form the number in the new base.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the result.\n\n```python\ndef convert_to_base(n, base):\n    digits = \"0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\"\n    if n == 0:\n        return \"0\"\n    result = []\n    while n > 0:\n        remainder = n % base\n        result.append(digits[remainder])\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(result))\n\n# Convert 778 from base-10 to base-13\nbase_10_number = 778\nbase_13_number = convert_to_base(base_10_number, 13)\nprint(base_13_number)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the base-13 representation of 778.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the base-13 representation of the base-10 number 778 is \"47b\". \n\nThe conversion process involved dividing 778 by 13 repeatedly and collecting the remainders, which were then mapped to the appropriate digits in base-13 using the string \"0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\".\n\n<<<47b>>>"
