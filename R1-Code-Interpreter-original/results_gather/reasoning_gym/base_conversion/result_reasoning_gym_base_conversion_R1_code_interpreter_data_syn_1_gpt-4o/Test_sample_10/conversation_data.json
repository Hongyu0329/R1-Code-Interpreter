    "To convert a number from base-3 to binary, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the base-3 number to a decimal number.**\n   - Each digit in the base-3 number represents a power of 3, starting from the rightmost digit which is 3^0.\n   - Multiply each digit by its corresponding power of 3 and sum them up to get the decimal equivalent.\n\n2. **Convert the decimal number to binary.**\n   - Divide the decimal number by 2 and record the remainder.\n   - Continue dividing the quotient by 2 until the quotient is 0, recording each remainder.\n   - The binary number is the sequence of remainders read in reverse order.\n\nLet's implement this process in Python to find the binary equivalent of the base-3 number 220020.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-3 to decimal\nbase_3_number = \"220020\"\ndecimal_number = 0\nbase = 3\n\n# Convert base-3 to decimal\nfor i, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_3_number)):\n    decimal_number += int(digit) * (base ** i)\n\n# Step 2: Convert decimal to binary\nbinary_number = \"\"\nwhile decimal_number > 0:\n    binary_number = str(decimal_number % 2) + binary_number\n    decimal_number //= 2\n\n# Print the binary number\nprint(binary_number)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the binary equivalent of the base-3 number 220020.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the binary equivalent of the base-3 number 220020 is `1010001110`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1010001110>>>"
