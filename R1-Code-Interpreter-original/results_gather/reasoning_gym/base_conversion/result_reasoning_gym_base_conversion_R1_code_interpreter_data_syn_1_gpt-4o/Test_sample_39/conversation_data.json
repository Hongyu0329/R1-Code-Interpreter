    "To convert a base-10 number to another base, we can use the method of successive division by the target base, keeping track of the remainders. These remainders represent the digits of the number in the new base, starting from the least significant digit (rightmost) to the most significant digit (leftmost).\n\nFor this problem, we need to convert the base-10 number 331 to base-11. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Divide the number by the target base (11) and record the remainder.\n2. Update the number to be the quotient of the division.\n3. Repeat the process until the quotient is zero.\n4. The remainders collected, in reverse order, form the number in the new base.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the result.\n\n```python\ndef convert_to_base(number, base):\n    if number == 0:\n        return \"0\"\n    \n    digits = []\n    while number:\n        remainder = number % base\n        if remainder >= 10:\n            # Convert remainder to corresponding letter for bases > 10\n            digits.append(chr(remainder - 10 + ord('a')))\n        else:\n            digits.append(str(remainder))\n        number //= base\n    \n    # The digits are collected in reverse order\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\n# Convert 331 from base-10 to base-11\nresult = convert_to_base(331, 11)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will output the base-11 representation of the number 331. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is `281`. This means that the base-10 number 331 is represented as `281` in base-11.\n\n<<<281>>>"
