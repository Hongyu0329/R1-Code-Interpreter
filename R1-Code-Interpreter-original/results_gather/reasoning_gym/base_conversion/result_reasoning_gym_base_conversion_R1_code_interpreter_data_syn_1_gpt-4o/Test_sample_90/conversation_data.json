    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the number from the original base to base-10 (decimal):**\n   - Start from the rightmost digit, multiply each digit by the base raised to the power of its position index (starting from 0), and sum all these values.\n\n2. **Convert the base-10 number to the target base:**\n   - Divide the base-10 number by the target base and keep track of the remainders.\n   - The remainders, read in reverse order, give the digits of the number in the target base.\n\nLet's apply this to convert the base-5 number 4042 to base-11.\n\n### Step 1: Convert 4042 from base-5 to base-10\n\nThe base-5 number 4042 can be expanded as:\n\\[ 4 \\times 5^3 + 0 \\times 5^2 + 4 \\times 5^1 + 2 \\times 5^0 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Convert the resulting base-10 number to base-11\n\nOnce we have the base-10 equivalent, we will convert it to base-11 by repeatedly dividing by 11 and recording the remainders.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the result.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-5 number 4042 to base-10\nbase_5_number = \"4042\"\nbase_5 = 5\n\n# Convert base-5 to base-10\nbase_10_number = 0\nfor index, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_5_number)):\n    base_10_number += int(digit) * (base_5 ** index)\n\n# Step 2: Convert base-10 number to base-11\nbase_11 = 11\nbase_11_number = \"\"\n\nwhile base_10_number > 0:\n    remainder = base_10_number % base_11\n    if remainder >= 10:\n        # Convert remainder to corresponding letter for bases > 10\n        base_11_number = chr(remainder - 10 + ord('a')) + base_11_number\n    else:\n        base_11_number = str(remainder) + base_11_number\n    base_10_number //= base_11\n\nprint(base_11_number)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the base-11 equivalent of the base-5 number 4042.",
