    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the original number to a base-10 (decimal) number.\n2. Convert the base-10 number to the target base.\n\nLet's apply this to the problem:\n\n1. **Convert the base-8 number 426 to base-10:**\n\n   The base-8 number 426 can be expanded as:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 8^2 + 2 \\times 8^1 + 6 \\times 8^0\n   \\]\n\n2. **Convert the resulting base-10 number to base-9:**\n\n   We will repeatedly divide the base-10 number by 9 and record the remainders. The base-9 number is formed by the remainders read in reverse order.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the final result.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-8 number 426 to base-10\nbase_8_number = \"426\"\nbase_10_number = int(base_8_number, 8)\n\n# Step 2: Convert base-10 number to base-9\ndef convert_to_base_9(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return \"0\"\n    digits = []\n    while n:\n        digits.append(int(n % 9))\n        n //= 9\n    return ''.join(str(x) for x in digits[::-1])\n\nbase_9_number = convert_to_base_9(base_10_number)\nprint(base_9_number)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the base-9 equivalent of the base-8 number 426.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the base-9 equivalent of the base-8 number 426 is 338.\n\n<<<338>>>"
