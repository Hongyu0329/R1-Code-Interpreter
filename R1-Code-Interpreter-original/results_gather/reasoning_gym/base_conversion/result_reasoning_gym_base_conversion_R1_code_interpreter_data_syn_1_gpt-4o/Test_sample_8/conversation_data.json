    "To convert a number from base-11 to hexadecimal (base-16), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the base-11 number to a decimal number**: This involves multiplying each digit of the base-11 number by 11 raised to the power of its position index (starting from 0 from the right) and summing the results.\n\n2. **Convert the decimal number to hexadecimal**: This involves repeatedly dividing the decimal number by 16 and recording the remainders. The hexadecimal number is formed by the remainders, read in reverse order.\n\nLet's perform these steps using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-11 number to decimal\nbase_11_number = \"397\"\ndecimal_number = 0\nbase_11_length = len(base_11_number)\n\nfor i, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_11_number)):\n    decimal_number += int(digit) * (11 ** i)\n\n# Step 2: Convert decimal number to hexadecimal\nhexadecimal_number = \"\"\nwhile decimal_number > 0:\n    remainder = decimal_number % 16\n    if remainder < 10:\n        hexadecimal_number = str(remainder) + hexadecimal_number\n    else:\n        # Convert remainder to corresponding hexadecimal character\n        hexadecimal_number = chr(ord('a') + remainder - 10) + hexadecimal_number\n    decimal_number //= 16\n\nprint(hexadecimal_number)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the hexadecimal equivalent of the base-11 number 397.",
    "The code executed successfully and converted the base-11 number 397 to its hexadecimal equivalent. The output is `1d5`.\n\nTherefore, the base-11 number 397 is equivalent to the hexadecimal number 1d5.\n\n<<<1d5>>>"
