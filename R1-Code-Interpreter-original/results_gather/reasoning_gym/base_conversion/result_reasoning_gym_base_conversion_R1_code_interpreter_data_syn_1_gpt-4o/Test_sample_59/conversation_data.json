    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the original number to base-10 (decimal):**\n   - We need to interpret the base-11 number `78` in base-10. \n   - The number `78` in base-11 can be expanded as: \\(7 \\times 11^1 + 8 \\times 11^0\\).\n\n2. **Convert the base-10 number to the target base (base-4):**\n   - Once we have the base-10 equivalent, we can convert it to base-4 by repeatedly dividing the number by 4 and recording the remainders.\n\nLet's implement this process using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-11 number '78' to base-10\nbase_11_number = '78'\nbase_11 = 11\n\n# Convert to base-10\nbase_10_number = int(base_11_number, base_11)\n\n# Step 2: Convert base-10 number to base-4\nbase_4 = 4\nbase_4_number = ''\n\nwhile base_10_number > 0:\n    remainder = base_10_number % base_4\n    base_4_number = str(remainder) + base_4_number\n    base_10_number //= base_4\n\nprint(base_4_number)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the base-4 equivalent of the base-11 number `78`.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the base-4 equivalent of the base-11 number `78` is `1111`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1111>>>"
