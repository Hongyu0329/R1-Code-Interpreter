    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the original number to base 10**: This involves interpreting the number in its original base and calculating its equivalent in base 10.\n\n2. **Convert the base 10 number to the target base**: Once we have the base 10 equivalent, we can convert it to the desired base by repeatedly dividing the number by the target base and recording the remainders.\n\nLet's apply this process to convert the base-14 number \"a8\" to base-9.\n\n### Step 1: Convert \"a8\" from base-14 to base-10\n\n- The number \"a8\" in base-14 can be broken down as:\n  - 'a' in base-14 is equivalent to 10 in base-10.\n  - '8' in base-14 is equivalent to 8 in base-10.\n\n- The base-10 equivalent of \"a8\" is calculated as:\n  \\[\n  (10 \\times 14^1) + (8 \\times 14^0) = 140 + 8 = 148\n  \\]\n\n### Step 2: Convert 148 from base-10 to base-9\n\n- We will divide 148 by 9 and keep track of the remainders.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\ndef base14_to_base10(number):\n    base14_digits = '0123456789abcdef'\n    base10 = 0\n    for i, digit in enumerate(reversed(number)):\n        base10 += base14_digits.index(digit) * (14 ** i)\n    return base10\n\ndef base10_to_base9(number):\n    if number == 0:\n        return '0'\n    base9_digits = []\n    while number > 0:\n        base9_digits.append(str(number % 9))\n        number //= 9\n    return ''.join(reversed(base9_digits))\n\n# Convert base-14 number 'a8' to base-10\nbase10_number = base14_to_base10('a8')\n\n# Convert the base-10 number to base-9\nbase9_number = base10_to_base9(base10_number)\n\nprint(base9_number)\n```\n\nThis script will convert the base-14 number \"a8\" to its base-9 equivalent. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the base-9 equivalent of the base-14 number \"a8\" is 174.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<174>>>"
