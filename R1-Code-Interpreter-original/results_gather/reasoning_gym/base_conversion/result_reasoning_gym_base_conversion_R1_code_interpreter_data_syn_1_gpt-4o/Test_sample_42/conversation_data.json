    "To convert a number from base-11 to base-10, we need to understand the positional value of each digit in the base-11 number. In base-11, each digit represents a power of 11, starting from the rightmost digit which is 11^0, then 11^1, 11^2, and so on.\n\nThe base-11 number given is 730. We will break it down as follows:\n\n- The rightmost digit '0' is in the 11^0 position.\n- The middle digit '3' is in the 11^1 position.\n- The leftmost digit '7' is in the 11^2 position.\n\nThe conversion to base-10 is done by multiplying each digit by its positional value and summing them up:\n\n- \\(7 \\times 11^2\\)\n- \\(3 \\times 11^1\\)\n- \\(0 \\times 11^0\\)\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Base-11 number\nbase_11_number = \"730\"\n\n# Convert each digit to base-10\nbase_10_value = 0\nbase = 11\n\n# Calculate the base-10 equivalent\nfor i, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_11_number)):\n    base_10_value += int(digit) * (base ** i)\n\nprint(base_10_value)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the base-10 equivalent of the base-11 number 730.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the base-10 equivalent of the base-11 number 730. The calculation was performed by multiplying each digit by its corresponding power of 11 and summing the results.\n\nThe base-11 number 730 is equivalent to 880 in base-10.\n\n<<<880>>>"
