    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the number from the original base to base 10 (decimal).**\n2. **Convert the decimal number to the target base.**\n\nLet's apply these steps to convert the base-12 number `107` to base-11.\n\n### Step 1: Convert from base-12 to base-10\n\nThe base-12 number `107` can be expanded as:\n\\[ 1 \\times 12^2 + 0 \\times 12^1 + 7 \\times 12^0 \\]\n\nLet's calculate this value in base-10.\n\n### Step 2: Convert from base-10 to base-11\n\nOnce we have the base-10 equivalent, we can convert it to base-11 by repeatedly dividing the number by 11 and recording the remainders.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the result.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-12 to base-10\nbase_12_number = \"107\"\nbase_12 = 12\nbase_10_number = 0\n\n# Calculate base-10 equivalent\nfor i, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_12_number)):\n    base_10_number += int(digit) * (base_12 ** i)\n\n# Step 2: Convert base-10 to base-11\nbase_11 = 11\nbase_11_number = \"\"\n\n# Calculate base-11 equivalent\nwhile base_10_number > 0:\n    remainder = base_10_number % base_11\n    base_11_number = str(remainder) + base_11_number\n    base_10_number //= base_11\n\nprint(base_11_number)\n```\n\nThis code will convert the base-12 number `107` to its base-11 equivalent. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the base-11 equivalent of the base-12 number `107` is `128`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<128>>>"
