    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the number from the original base to base-10 (decimal):**\n   - For a base-8 number like 307, each digit represents a power of 8.\n   - Calculate the decimal equivalent by multiplying each digit by 8 raised to the power of its position (from right to left, starting at 0).\n\n2. **Convert the base-10 number to the target base (base-14 in this case):**\n   - Divide the base-10 number by the target base (14) and keep track of the remainders.\n   - The remainders represent the digits of the number in the new base, starting from the least significant digit.\n\nLet's perform these steps using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-8 number 307 to base-10\nbase_8_number = '307'\nbase_10_number = 0\n\n# Convert base-8 to base-10\nfor i, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_8_number)):\n    base_10_number += int(digit) * (8 ** i)\n\n# Step 2: Convert base-10 number to base-14\nbase_14_number = ''\nbase = 14\ndigits = '0123456789abcdef'\n\nwhile base_10_number > 0:\n    remainder = base_10_number % base\n    base_14_number = digits[remainder] + base_14_number\n    base_10_number //= base\n\nprint(base_14_number)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the base-14 equivalent of the base-8 number 307.",
