    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the number from the original base to base 10 (decimal):**\n   - Each digit in the number is multiplied by the base raised to the power of its position index (starting from 0 on the right).\n   - Sum all these values to get the decimal equivalent.\n\n2. **Convert the decimal number to the target base:**\n   - Divide the decimal number by the target base and keep track of the remainders.\n   - The remainders, read in reverse order, give the digits of the number in the target base.\n\nLet's apply this to convert the base-13 number \"4c9\" to base-11.\n\n### Step 1: Convert \"4c9\" from base-13 to decimal\n\n- The number \"4c9\" in base-13 can be broken down as:\n  - \\(4 \\times 13^2 + c \\times 13^1 + 9 \\times 13^0\\)\n  - Here, 'c' in base-13 is equivalent to 12 in decimal.\n\n### Step 2: Convert the decimal number to base-11\n\n- Once we have the decimal equivalent, we will convert it to base-11 by dividing by 11 and recording the remainders.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\ndef base13_to_decimal(base13_num):\n    base13_digits = '0123456789abc'\n    decimal_value = 0\n    for i, digit in enumerate(reversed(base13_num)):\n        decimal_value += base13_digits.index(digit) * (13 ** i)\n    return decimal_value\n\ndef decimal_to_base11(decimal_num):\n    base11_digits = '0123456789a'\n    if decimal_num == 0:\n        return '0'\n    base11_num = ''\n    while decimal_num > 0:\n        remainder = decimal_num % 11\n        base11_num = base11_digits[remainder] + base11_num\n        decimal_num //= 11\n    return base11_num\n\n# Convert base-13 number \"4c9\" to decimal\ndecimal_value = base13_to_decimal('4c9')\n\n# Convert the decimal value to base-11\nbase11_value = decimal_to_base11(decimal_value)\n\nprint(base11_value)\n```\n\nThis code will convert the base-13 number \"4c9\" to its base-11 equivalent. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the base-11 equivalent of the base-13 number \"4c9\" is \"6a5\".\n\n<<<6a5>>>"
