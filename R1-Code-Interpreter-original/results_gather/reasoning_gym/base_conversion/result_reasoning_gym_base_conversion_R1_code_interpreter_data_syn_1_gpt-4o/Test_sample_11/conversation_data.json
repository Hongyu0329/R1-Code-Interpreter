    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the number from the original base to base-10 (decimal):**\n   - For a number in base-6, each digit represents a power of 6. \n   - The number 103 in base-6 can be expanded as: \\(1 \\times 6^2 + 0 \\times 6^1 + 3 \\times 6^0\\).\n\n2. **Convert the base-10 number to the target base (base-13 in this case):**\n   - We repeatedly divide the base-10 number by the target base (13) and keep track of the remainders.\n   - The remainders, read in reverse order, give us the digits of the number in the target base.\n\nLet's implement this process in Python to find the base-13 representation of the base-6 number 103.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-6 number 103 to base-10\nbase_6_number = \"103\"\nbase_10_number = 0\nbase_6_length = len(base_6_number)\n\nfor i in range(base_6_length):\n    digit = int(base_6_number[i])\n    power = base_6_length - i - 1\n    base_10_number += digit * (6 ** power)\n\n# Step 2: Convert base-10 number to base-13\nbase_13_number = \"\"\nbase = 13\nwhile base_10_number > 0:\n    remainder = base_10_number % base\n    if remainder >= 10:\n        # Convert remainder to corresponding letter\n        remainder = chr(remainder - 10 + ord('a'))\n    base_13_number = str(remainder) + base_13_number\n    base_10_number //= base\n\nprint(base_13_number)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to find the base-13 representation of the base-6 number 103.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the base-13 representation of the base-6 number 103 is \"30\". \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<30>>>"
