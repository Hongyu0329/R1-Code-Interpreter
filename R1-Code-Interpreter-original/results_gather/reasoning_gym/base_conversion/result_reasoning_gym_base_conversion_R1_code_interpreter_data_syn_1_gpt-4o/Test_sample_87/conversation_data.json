    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the number from the original base to base-10 (decimal).\n2. Convert the base-10 number to the target base.\n\nLet's apply this to convert the base-6 number 4220 to base-4.\n\n### Step 1: Convert from base-6 to base-10\n\nThe base-6 number 4220 can be expanded as:\n\\[ 4 \\times 6^3 + 2 \\times 6^2 + 2 \\times 6^1 + 0 \\times 6^0 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Convert from base-10 to base-4\n\nOnce we have the base-10 equivalent, we can convert it to base-4 by repeatedly dividing the number by 4 and recording the remainders.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-6 to base-10\nbase_6_number = \"4220\"\nbase_10_number = 0\nbase_6_number_reversed = base_6_number[::-1]\n\nfor i, digit in enumerate(base_6_number_reversed):\n    base_10_number += int(digit) * (6 ** i)\n\n# Step 2: Convert base-10 to base-4\nbase_4_number = \"\"\nwhile base_10_number > 0:\n    remainder = base_10_number % 4\n    base_4_number = str(remainder) + base_4_number\n    base_10_number //= 4\n\nprint(base_4_number)\n```\n\nThis code will convert the base-6 number 4220 to its base-4 equivalent. Let's execute it to find the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is `32310`. This means the base-6 number `4220` is equivalent to the base-4 number `32310`.\n\n<<<32310>>>"
