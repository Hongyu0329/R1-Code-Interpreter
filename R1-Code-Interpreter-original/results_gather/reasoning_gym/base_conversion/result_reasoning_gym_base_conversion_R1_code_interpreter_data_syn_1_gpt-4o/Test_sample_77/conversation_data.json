    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the number from the original base to base-10 (decimal):**\n   - Start from the rightmost digit, multiply each digit by the base raised to the power of its position index (starting from 0), and sum all these values.\n\n2. **Convert the base-10 number to the target base:**\n   - Divide the base-10 number by the target base and keep track of the remainders.\n   - The remainders, read in reverse order, give the digits of the number in the target base.\n\nLet's apply this process to convert the base-5 number 2121 to base-9.\n\n### Step 1: Convert 2121 from base-5 to base-10\n\nThe base-5 number 2121 can be expanded as:\n\\[ 2 \\times 5^3 + 1 \\times 5^2 + 2 \\times 5^1 + 1 \\times 5^0 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Convert the resulting base-10 number to base-9\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Convert base-5 number 2121 to base-10\nbase_5_number = '2121'\nbase_5 = 5\nbase_10_number = sum(int(digit) * (base_5 ** idx) for idx, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_5_number)))\n\n# Convert base-10 number to base-9\nbase_9 = 9\nbase_9_number = ''\nwhile base_10_number > 0:\n    remainder = base_10_number % base_9\n    base_9_number = str(remainder) + base_9_number\n    base_10_number //= base_9\n\nprint(base_9_number)\n```\n\nThis script will convert the base-5 number 2121 to base-9. Let's execute it to find the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is `347`. This means that the base-5 number `2121` is equivalent to the base-9 number `347`.\n\n<<<347>>>"
