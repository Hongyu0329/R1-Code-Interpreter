    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the number from the original base to base-10 (decimal):**\n   - For a base-12 number, each digit represents a power of 12. \n   - The number 27 in base-12 can be broken down as follows: \n     - The digit '2' is in the 12^1 place, and the digit '7' is in the 12^0 place.\n     - Therefore, the base-10 equivalent is \\(2 \\times 12^1 + 7 \\times 12^0\\).\n\n2. **Convert the base-10 number to the target base (base-15 in this case):**\n   - We repeatedly divide the base-10 number by the target base (15) and keep track of the remainders.\n   - The remainders represent the digits of the number in the new base, starting from the least significant digit.\n\nLet's implement this process in Python to find the base-15 equivalent of the base-12 number 27.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-12 number '27' to base-10\nbase_12_number = '27'\nbase_10_number = 0\nbase_12 = 12\n\n# Convert each digit to base-10\nfor i, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_12_number)):\n    base_10_number += int(digit) * (base_12 ** i)\n\n# Step 2: Convert base-10 number to base-15\nbase_15_number = ''\nbase_15 = 15\n\nwhile base_10_number > 0:\n    remainder = base_10_number % base_15\n    if remainder >= 10:\n        # Convert remainder to corresponding letter for base > 10\n        base_15_number = chr(remainder - 10 + ord('a')) + base_15_number\n    else:\n        base_15_number = str(remainder) + base_15_number\n    base_10_number //= base_15\n\nprint(base_15_number)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the base-15 equivalent of the base-12 number 27.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is `21`. This means that the base-12 number `27` is equivalent to `21` in base-15.\n\n<<<21>>>"
