    "To convert a number from base-15 to hexadecimal (base-16), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the base-15 number to a decimal (base-10) number.**\n   - The base-15 number is `2c1`.\n   - In base-15, the digit 'c' represents the decimal value 12.\n   - The number `2c1` in base-15 can be expanded as:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 15^2 + 12 \\times 15^1 + 1 \\times 15^0\n     \\]\n\n2. **Convert the decimal number to hexadecimal (base-16).**\n   - Once we have the decimal equivalent, we can convert it to base-16 by repeatedly dividing the number by 16 and recording the remainders.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the solution:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-15 number '2c1' to decimal\nbase_15_number = '2c1'\nbase_15_digits = '0123456789abcde'\ndecimal_value = 0\n\n# Calculate the decimal value\nfor i, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_15_number)):\n    decimal_value += base_15_digits.index(digit) * (15 ** i)\n\n# Step 2: Convert the decimal value to hexadecimal\nhexadecimal_value = ''\nhex_digits = '0123456789abcdef'\n\nwhile decimal_value > 0:\n    remainder = decimal_value % 16\n    hexadecimal_value = hex_digits[remainder] + hexadecimal_value\n    decimal_value //= 16\n\nprint(hexadecimal_value)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the hexadecimal equivalent of the base-15 number `2c1`.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is `277`. This means that the base-15 number `2c1` is equivalent to the hexadecimal number `277`.\n\n<<<277>>>"
