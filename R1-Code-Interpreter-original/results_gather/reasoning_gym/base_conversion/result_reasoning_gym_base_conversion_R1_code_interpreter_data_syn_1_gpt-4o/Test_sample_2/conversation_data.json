    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the base-7 number to a decimal (base-10) number.**\n   - Each digit in the base-7 number represents a power of 7. \n   - For example, the number 1402 in base-7 can be expanded as:\n     \\[\n     1 \\times 7^3 + 4 \\times 7^2 + 0 \\times 7^1 + 2 \\times 7^0\n     \\]\n\n2. **Convert the decimal number to the target base (base-11 in this case).**\n   - Divide the decimal number by the target base (11) and keep track of the remainders.\n   - The remainders represent the digits in the new base, starting from the least significant digit.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the base-11 representation of the base-7 number 1402.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-7 number to decimal\nbase_7_number = \"1402\"\ndecimal_number = 0\nbase_7_length = len(base_7_number)\n\nfor i in range(base_7_length):\n    digit = int(base_7_number[i])\n    power = base_7_length - i - 1\n    decimal_number += digit * (7 ** power)\n\n# Step 2: Convert decimal number to base-11\nbase_11_number = \"\"\nwhile decimal_number > 0:\n    remainder = decimal_number % 11\n    if remainder >= 10:\n        # Convert remainder to corresponding letter for base > 10\n        remainder = chr(remainder - 10 + ord('a'))\n    base_11_number = str(remainder) + base_11_number\n    decimal_number //= 11\n\nprint(base_11_number)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the base-11 representation.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is `452`. This means that the base-7 number `1402` converts to `452` in base-11.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<452>>>"
