    "To convert a number from base-3 to base-12, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the base-3 number to a decimal (base-10) number.**\n   - Each digit in the base-3 number represents a power of 3, starting from the rightmost digit which is 3^0.\n   - Multiply each digit by its corresponding power of 3 and sum them up to get the decimal equivalent.\n\n2. **Convert the decimal number to base-12.**\n   - Divide the decimal number by 12 and keep track of the remainders.\n   - The remainders represent the digits in the base-12 number, starting from the least significant digit.\n\nLet's implement this process in Python to find the base-12 equivalent of the base-3 number 200001.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-3 to decimal\nbase_3_number = \"200001\"\ndecimal_number = 0\nbase_3_length = len(base_3_number)\n\nfor i in range(base_3_length):\n    digit = int(base_3_number[base_3_length - i - 1])\n    decimal_number += digit * (3 ** i)\n\n# Step 2: Convert decimal to base-12\nbase_12_number = \"\"\nwhile decimal_number > 0:\n    remainder = decimal_number % 12\n    if remainder >= 10:\n        # Convert remainder to corresponding letter for base > 10\n        base_12_number = chr(remainder - 10 + ord('a')) + base_12_number\n    else:\n        base_12_number = str(remainder) + base_12_number\n    decimal_number //= 12\n\nprint(base_12_number)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the base-12 equivalent of the base-3 number 200001.",
