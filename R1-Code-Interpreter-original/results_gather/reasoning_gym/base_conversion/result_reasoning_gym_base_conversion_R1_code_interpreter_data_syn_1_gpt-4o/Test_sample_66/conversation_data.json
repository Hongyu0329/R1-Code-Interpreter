    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the number from the original base to base 10 (decimal):**\n   - For a base-11 number like 301, each digit represents a power of 11.\n   - The number 301 in base-11 can be expanded as: \\(3 \\times 11^2 + 0 \\times 11^1 + 1 \\times 11^0\\).\n\n2. **Convert the base-10 number to the target base (base-15 in this case):**\n   - Divide the base-10 number by the target base (15) and keep track of the remainders.\n   - The remainders represent the digits of the number in the new base, starting from the least significant digit.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-11 number 301 to base-10\nbase_11_number = \"301\"\nbase_11 = 11\n\n# Convert to base-10\nbase_10_number = 0\nfor i, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_11_number)):\n    base_10_number += int(digit) * (base_11 ** i)\n\n# Step 2: Convert base-10 number to base-15\nbase_15 = 15\nbase_15_number = \"\"\n\nwhile base_10_number > 0:\n    remainder = base_10_number % base_15\n    if remainder >= 10:\n        # Convert remainder to corresponding letter for bases > 10\n        base_15_number = chr(remainder - 10 + ord('a')) + base_15_number\n    else:\n        base_15_number = str(remainder) + base_15_number\n    base_10_number //= base_15\n\nprint(base_15_number)\n```\n\nThis code will convert the base-11 number 301 to base-15 and print the result. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is `194`. This means that the base-11 number `301` is equivalent to `194` in base-15.\n\n<<<194>>>"
