    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the number from the original base to base 10 (decimal):**\n   - For a number in base-15, each digit represents a power of 15. \n   - The number 424 in base-15 can be expanded as: \\(4 \\times 15^2 + 2 \\times 15^1 + 4 \\times 15^0\\).\n\n2. **Convert the base-10 number to the target base (base-9 in this case):**\n   - Divide the base-10 number by the target base (9) and keep track of the remainders.\n   - The remainders, read in reverse order, will give the digits of the number in the target base.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-15 number 424 to base-10\nbase_15_number = \"424\"\nbase_15 = 15\n\n# Convert to base-10\nbase_10_number = 0\nfor i, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_15_number)):\n    base_10_number += int(digit) * (base_15 ** i)\n\n# Step 2: Convert base-10 number to base-9\nbase_9 = 9\nbase_9_number = \"\"\n\nwhile base_10_number > 0:\n    remainder = base_10_number % base_9\n    base_9_number = str(remainder) + base_9_number\n    base_10_number //= base_9\n\nprint(base_9_number)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the base-9 equivalent of the base-15 number 424.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the base-9 equivalent of the base-15 number 424 is 1247.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1247>>>"
