    "To convert a number from base-3 to base-10, we need to understand the positional value of each digit in the base-3 number. Each digit in a base-3 number represents a power of 3, starting from the rightmost digit which is 3^0, the next is 3^1, and so on.\n\nThe base-3 number given is 101121. We will convert it to base-10 by multiplying each digit by its corresponding power of 3 and summing the results.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the conversion:\n\n- The rightmost digit is 1, which is multiplied by 3^0.\n- The next digit is 2, which is multiplied by 3^1.\n- The next digit is 1, which is multiplied by 3^2.\n- The next digit is 1, which is multiplied by 3^3.\n- The next digit is 0, which is multiplied by 3^4.\n- The leftmost digit is 1, which is multiplied by 3^5.\n\nThe base-10 value is the sum of all these products.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Base-3 number\nbase_3_number = \"101121\"\n\n# Convert base-3 to base-10\nbase_10_number = 0\nfor i, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_3_number)):\n    base_10_number += int(digit) * (3 ** i)\n\nprint(base_10_number)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the base-10 equivalent of the base-3 number 101121.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the base-10 equivalent of the base-3 number 101121. \n\nThe conversion process was as follows:\n\n- \\(1 \\times 3^5 = 243\\)\n- \\(0 \\times 3^4 = 0\\)\n- \\(1 \\times 3^3 = 27\\)\n- \\(1 \\times 3^2 = 9\\)\n- \\(2 \\times 3^1 = 6\\)\n- \\(1 \\times 3^0 = 1\\)\n\nAdding these values together gives:\n\n\\[243 + 0 + 27 + 9 + 6 + 1 = 286\\]\n\nThus, the base-10 equivalent of the base-3 number 101121 is 286.\n\n<<<286>>>"
