    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the number from the original base to base 10 (decimal):**\n   - Each digit in the number is multiplied by the base raised to the power of its position index (starting from 0 on the right).\n   - Sum all these values to get the decimal equivalent.\n\n2. **Convert the decimal number to the target base:**\n   - Divide the decimal number by the target base and keep track of the remainders.\n   - The remainders, read in reverse order, give the digits of the number in the target base.\n\nLet's apply this to convert the base-15 number \"22c\" to base-12.\n\n### Step 1: Convert \"22c\" from base-15 to decimal\n\n- The number \"22c\" in base-15 can be broken down as:\n  - \\(2 \\times 15^2 + 2 \\times 15^1 + c \\times 15^0\\)\n  - Here, 'c' in base-15 is equivalent to 12 in decimal.\n\n### Step 2: Convert the decimal number to base-12\n\n- Once we have the decimal equivalent, we will convert it to base-12 by dividing by 12 and recording the remainders.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-15 to decimal\nbase_15_number = \"22c\"\nbase_15 = 15\n\n# Convert each digit to its decimal equivalent\ndecimal_value = 0\nfor i, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_15_number)):\n    if digit.isdigit():\n        value = int(digit)\n    else:\n        value = ord(digit) - ord('a') + 10\n    decimal_value += value * (base_15 ** i)\n\n# Step 2: Convert decimal to base-12\nbase_12 = 12\nbase_12_number = []\n\nwhile decimal_value > 0:\n    remainder = decimal_value % base_12\n    if remainder >= 10:\n        base_12_number.append(chr(remainder - 10 + ord('a')))\n    else:\n        base_12_number.append(str(remainder))\n    decimal_value //= base_12\n\n# The base-12 number is the reverse of the remainders collected\nbase_12_number.reverse()\nbase_12_result = ''.join(base_12_number)\n\nprint(base_12_result)\n```\n\nThis script will convert the base-15 number \"22c\" to its base-12 equivalent. Let's execute the code to find the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the base-15 number \"22c\" was converted to the base-12 number \"350\". \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<350>>>"
