    "To convert a number from base-15 to base-10, we need to understand the positional value of each digit in the base-15 number. In base-15, each digit represents a power of 15, starting from the rightmost digit which is 15^0, then 15^1, 15^2, and so on.\n\nThe base-15 number given is 119. Let's break it down:\n\n- The rightmost digit '9' is in the 15^0 position.\n- The middle digit '1' is in the 15^1 position.\n- The leftmost digit '1' is in the 15^2 position.\n\nTo convert this to base-10, we calculate the value of each digit multiplied by its positional value and sum them up:\n\n- The value of the rightmost digit: 9 * (15^0) = 9 * 1 = 9\n- The value of the middle digit: 1 * (15^1) = 1 * 15 = 15\n- The value of the leftmost digit: 1 * (15^2) = 1 * 225 = 225\n\nNow, we sum these values to get the base-10 equivalent.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Base-15 number\nbase_15_number = \"119\"\n\n# Convert base-15 to base-10\nbase_10_number = int(base_15_number, 15)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(base_10_number)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the base-10 equivalent.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the base-10 equivalent of the base-15 number 119 is 249.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<249>>>"
