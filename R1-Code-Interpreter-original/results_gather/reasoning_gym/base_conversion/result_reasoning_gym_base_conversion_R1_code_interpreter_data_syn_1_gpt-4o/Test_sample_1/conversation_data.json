    "To convert a number from base-4 to base-12, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the base-4 number to a base-10 (decimal) number.**\n   - Each digit in the base-4 number represents a power of 4, starting from the rightmost digit which is 4^0.\n   - For the base-4 number 21020, calculate its decimal equivalent by summing up each digit multiplied by 4 raised to the power of its position index (from right to left, starting at 0).\n\n2. **Convert the base-10 number to a base-12 number.**\n   - Divide the base-10 number by 12 and keep track of the remainders.\n   - The remainders represent the digits of the base-12 number, starting from the least significant digit (rightmost).\n\nLet's implement this process in Python to find the base-12 equivalent of the base-4 number 21020.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-4 to base-10\nbase_4_number = \"21020\"\nbase_10_number = 0\n\n# Calculate the base-10 equivalent\nfor index, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_4_number)):\n    base_10_number += int(digit) * (4 ** index)\n\n# Step 2: Convert base-10 to base-12\nbase_12_number = \"\"\nwhile base_10_number > 0:\n    remainder = base_10_number % 12\n    if remainder >= 10:\n        # Convert remainder to a letter if it's 10 or 11\n        base_12_number = chr(remainder - 10 + ord('a')) + base_12_number\n    else:\n        base_12_number = str(remainder) + base_12_number\n    base_10_number //= 12\n\nprint(base_12_number)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the base-12 equivalent of the base-4 number 21020.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the base-12 equivalent of the base-4 number 21020 is 408. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<408>>>"
