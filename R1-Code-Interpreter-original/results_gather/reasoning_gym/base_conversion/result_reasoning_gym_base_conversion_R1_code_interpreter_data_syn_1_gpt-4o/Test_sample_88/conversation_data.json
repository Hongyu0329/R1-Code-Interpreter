    "To convert a number from base-5 to hexadecimal, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the base-5 number to a decimal number.**\n   - The base-5 number 4102 can be expanded as:\n     \\[\n     4 \\times 5^3 + 1 \\times 5^2 + 0 \\times 5^1 + 2 \\times 5^0\n     \\]\n\n2. **Convert the decimal number to a hexadecimal number.**\n   - Once we have the decimal equivalent, we can convert it to hexadecimal by repeatedly dividing the number by 16 and recording the remainders.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the result.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-5 to decimal\nbase_5_number = \"4102\"\ndecimal_number = 0\nbase = 5\n\n# Convert base-5 to decimal\nfor i, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_5_number)):\n    decimal_number += int(digit) * (base ** i)\n\n# Step 2: Convert decimal to hexadecimal\nhexadecimal_number = \"\"\nhex_digits = \"0123456789abcdef\"\n\nwhile decimal_number > 0:\n    remainder = decimal_number % 16\n    hexadecimal_number = hex_digits[remainder] + hexadecimal_number\n    decimal_number //= 16\n\n# If the number is 0, the hexadecimal representation is also 0\nif not hexadecimal_number:\n    hexadecimal_number = \"0\"\n\nprint(hexadecimal_number)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the hexadecimal equivalent of the base-5 number 4102.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is `20f`. This means that the base-5 number `4102` is equivalent to the hexadecimal number `20f`.\n\n<<<20f>>>"
