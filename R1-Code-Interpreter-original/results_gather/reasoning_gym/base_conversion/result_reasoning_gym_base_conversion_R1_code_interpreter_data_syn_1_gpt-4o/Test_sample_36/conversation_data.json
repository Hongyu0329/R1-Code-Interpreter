    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the number from the original base to base 10 (decimal):**\n   - For a number in base-9, each digit represents a power of 9. \n   - For example, the number 1033 in base-9 can be expanded as:\n     \\[\n     1 \\times 9^3 + 0 \\times 9^2 + 3 \\times 9^1 + 3 \\times 9^0\n     \\]\n\n2. **Convert the base-10 number to the target base (base-13 in this case):**\n   - Repeatedly divide the base-10 number by the target base (13) and keep track of the remainders.\n   - The remainders, read in reverse order, give the digits of the number in the target base.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the base-13 representation of the base-9 number 1033.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-9 number 1033 to base-10\nbase_9_number = \"1033\"\nbase_10_number = 0\nbase_9_length = len(base_9_number)\n\nfor i in range(base_9_length):\n    digit = int(base_9_number[i])\n    power = base_9_length - i - 1\n    base_10_number += digit * (9 ** power)\n\n# Step 2: Convert base-10 number to base-13\nbase_13_number = \"\"\nwhile base_10_number > 0:\n    remainder = base_10_number % 13\n    if remainder >= 10:\n        # Convert remainder to corresponding letter for base > 10\n        base_13_number = chr(remainder - 10 + ord('a')) + base_13_number\n    else:\n        base_13_number = str(remainder) + base_13_number\n    base_10_number //= 13\n\nprint(base_13_number)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the base-13 representation.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the base-13 representation of the base-9 number 1033 is `465`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<465>>>"
