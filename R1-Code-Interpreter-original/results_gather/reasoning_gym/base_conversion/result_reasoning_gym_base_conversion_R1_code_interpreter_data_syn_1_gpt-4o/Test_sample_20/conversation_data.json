    "To convert a binary number to a hexadecimal number, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Group the binary digits into sets of four**, starting from the right. If the number of binary digits is not a multiple of four, pad the leftmost group with zeros.\n\n2. **Convert each group of four binary digits to a single hexadecimal digit**. Each group of four binary digits corresponds to a single hexadecimal digit.\n\n3. **Combine the hexadecimal digits** to form the final hexadecimal number.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the binary number `100010010`:\n\n1. Group the binary digits into sets of four:\n   - 0001 0001 0010\n\n2. Convert each group to a hexadecimal digit:\n   - 0001 -> 1\n   - 0001 -> 1\n   - 0010 -> 2\n\n3. Combine the hexadecimal digits:\n   - The hexadecimal number is `112`.\n\nLet's verify this conversion using a Python script to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\ndef binary_to_hexadecimal(binary_str):\n    # Convert binary to integer\n    decimal_value = int(binary_str, 2)\n    # Convert integer to hexadecimal\n    hexadecimal_value = hex(decimal_value)[2:]  # [2:] to remove the '0x' prefix\n    return hexadecimal_value\n\nbinary_number = \"100010010\"\nhexadecimal_number = binary_to_hexadecimal(binary_number)\nprint(hexadecimal_number)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the conversion.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output confirms that the binary number `100010010` converts to the hexadecimal number `112`. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<112>>>"
