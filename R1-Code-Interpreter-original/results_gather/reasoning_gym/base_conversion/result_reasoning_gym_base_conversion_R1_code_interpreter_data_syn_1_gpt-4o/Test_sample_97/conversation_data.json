    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the number from the original base to base 10 (decimal):**\n   - For a number in base-15, each digit represents a power of 15. \n   - The number 2a0 in base-15 can be broken down as:\n     - \\(2 \\times 15^2\\)\n     - \\(a \\times 15^1\\) (where 'a' represents 10 in decimal)\n     - \\(0 \\times 15^0\\)\n\n2. **Convert the decimal number to the target base (base-14 in this case):**\n   - Repeatedly divide the decimal number by the target base (14) and keep track of the remainders.\n   - The remainders, read in reverse order, will give the number in the target base.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the base-14 equivalent of the base-15 number 2a0.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-15 number '2a0' to decimal\nbase_15_number = '2a0'\nbase_15 = 15\n\n# Convert each digit to decimal\ndecimal_value = 0\nfor i, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_15_number)):\n    if digit.isdigit():\n        value = int(digit)\n    else:\n        value = ord(digit) - ord('a') + 10\n    decimal_value += value * (base_15 ** i)\n\n# Step 2: Convert the decimal number to base-14\nbase_14 = 14\nbase_14_number = ''\n\nwhile decimal_value > 0:\n    remainder = decimal_value % base_14\n    if remainder < 10:\n        base_14_number = str(remainder) + base_14_number\n    else:\n        base_14_number = chr(remainder - 10 + ord('a')) + base_14_number\n    decimal_value //= base_14\n\nprint(base_14_number)\n```\n\nThis code will convert the base-15 number '2a0' to its base-14 equivalent. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the base-15 number '2a0' was correctly converted to base-14. The result is '30c'.\n\nTherefore, the base-14 equivalent of the base-15 number '2a0' is:\n\n<<<30c>>>"
