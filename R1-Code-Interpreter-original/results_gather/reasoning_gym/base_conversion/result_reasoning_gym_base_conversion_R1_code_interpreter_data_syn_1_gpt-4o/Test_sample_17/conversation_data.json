    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the number from the original base to base-10 (decimal):**\n   - For a base-7 number, each digit represents a power of 7. For example, the number 125 in base-7 is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     1 \\times 7^2 + 2 \\times 7^1 + 5 \\times 7^0\n     \\]\n\n2. **Convert the base-10 number to the target base (base-8 in this case):**\n   - Once we have the decimal equivalent, we can convert it to base-8 by repeatedly dividing the number by 8 and recording the remainders.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the base-8 equivalent of the base-7 number 125.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-7 number 125 to base-10\nbase_7_number = \"125\"\nbase_10_number = 0\nbase_7_length = len(base_7_number)\n\nfor i in range(base_7_length):\n    digit = int(base_7_number[i])\n    power = base_7_length - i - 1\n    base_10_number += digit * (7 ** power)\n\n# Step 2: Convert base-10 number to base-8\nbase_8_number = \"\"\nwhile base_10_number > 0:\n    remainder = base_10_number % 8\n    base_8_number = str(remainder) + base_8_number\n    base_10_number //= 8\n\nprint(base_8_number)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the base-8 equivalent of the base-7 number 125.",
    "The code executed successfully and converted the base-7 number 125 to base-8, resulting in the number 104.\n\nTherefore, the base-8 equivalent of the base-7 number 125 is:\n\n<<<104>>>"
