    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the number from the original base to base-10 (decimal):**\n   - We will convert the base-9 number 461 to a decimal number.\n   - The base-9 number 461 can be expanded as: \\(4 \\times 9^2 + 6 \\times 9^1 + 1 \\times 9^0\\).\n\n2. **Convert the decimal number to the target base (base-8 in this case):**\n   - Once we have the decimal equivalent, we will convert it to base-8.\n   - This involves repeatedly dividing the decimal number by 8 and recording the remainders.\n\nLet's implement this process using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Convert base-9 number 461 to decimal\nbase_9_number = \"461\"\ndecimal_number = 0\nbase_9 = 9\n\n# Convert base-9 to decimal\nfor i, digit in enumerate(reversed(base_9_number)):\n    decimal_number += int(digit) * (base_9 ** i)\n\n# Step 2: Convert decimal number to base-8\nbase_8 = 8\nbase_8_number = \"\"\n\n# Convert decimal to base-8\nwhile decimal_number > 0:\n    remainder = decimal_number % base_8\n    base_8_number = str(remainder) + base_8_number\n    decimal_number //= base_8\n\nprint(base_8_number)\n```\n\nThis code will convert the base-9 number 461 to its base-8 equivalent. Let's execute the code to find the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the base-9 number 461 was converted to the base-8 number 573. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<573>>>"
