    "To convert a number from base-11 to base-10, we need to understand the positional value of each digit in the base-11 number. In base-11, each digit represents a power of 11, starting from the rightmost digit which is 11^0, then 11^1, 11^2, and so on.\n\nLet's break down the conversion of the base-11 number 730 to base-10 step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the digits and their positions:**\n   - The number 730 in base-11 has three digits: 7, 3, and 0.\n   - The rightmost digit (0) is in the 11^0 position.\n   - The middle digit (3) is in the 11^1 position.\n   - The leftmost digit (7) is in the 11^2 position.\n\n2. **Calculate the value of each digit:**\n   - The rightmost digit is 0, and its value is 0 * 11^0 = 0 * 1 = 0.\n   - The middle digit is 3, and its value is 3 * 11^1 = 3 * 11 = 33.\n   - The leftmost digit is 7, and its value is 7 * 11^2 = 7 * 121 = 847.\n\n3. **Sum the values to get the base-10 equivalent:**\n   - Add the values of each digit: 0 + 33 + 847 = 880.\n\nTherefore, the base-10 equivalent of the base-11 number 730 is 880.\n\nThe final answer is formatted as requested:\n\n<<<880>>>"
