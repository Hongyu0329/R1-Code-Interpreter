    "To convert the base-5 number 2121 to base-9, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's break it down:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Base-5 Number\nThe number 2121 in base-5 means:\n- The rightmost digit is the least significant digit (LSD).\n- Each digit represents a power of 5, starting from 0 on the right.\n\nSo, 2121 in base-5 can be expanded as:\n- \\(2 \\times 5^3\\)\n- \\(1 \\times 5^2\\)\n- \\(2 \\times 5^1\\)\n- \\(1 \\times 5^0\\)\n\n### Step 2: Convert Base-5 to Base-10\nCalculate the decimal (base-10) equivalent of the base-5 number:\n\n- \\(2 \\times 5^3 = 2 \\times 125 = 250\\)\n- \\(1 \\times 5^2 = 1 \\times 25 = 25\\)\n- \\(2 \\times 5^1 = 2 \\times 5 = 10\\)\n- \\(1 \\times 5^0 = 1 \\times 1 = 1\\)\n\nAdd these values together to get the base-10 equivalent:\n\\[250 + 25 + 10 + 1 = 286\\]\n\n### Step 3: Convert Base-10 to Base-9\nNow, convert the decimal number 286 to base-9:\n\n1. **Divide 286 by 9**:\n   - 286 รท 9 = 31 remainder 7\n   - The remainder (7) is the least significant digit (LSD) in base-9.\n\n2. **Divide the quotient (31) by 9**:\n   - 31 รท 9 = 3 remainder 4\n   - The remainder (4) is the next digit in base-9.\n\n3. **Divide the quotient (3) by 9**:\n   - 3 รท 9 = 0 remainder 3\n   - The remainder (3) is the most significant digit (MSD) in base-9.\n\n### Step 4: Compile the Base-9 Number\nThe base-9 number is compiled from the remainders, starting from the last division:\n- MSD to LSD: 347\n\n### Final Answer\nThe base-5 number 2121 is equivalent to the base-9 number 347.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<347>>>"
