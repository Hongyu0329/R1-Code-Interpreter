    "To convert a number from base-13 to base-5, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input**: The number given is \"b6\" in base-13. In base-13, digits range from 0 to 9 and then continue with letters a, b, c, etc., where 'a' represents 10, 'b' represents 11, and so on.\n\n2. **Convert Base-13 to Decimal**: \n   - The number \"b6\" in base-13 can be broken down as follows:\n     - 'b' is 11 in decimal.\n     - '6' is 6 in decimal.\n   - The base-13 number \"b6\" can be expressed in decimal as:\n     \\[\n     11 \\times 13^1 + 6 \\times 13^0\n     \\]\n   - Calculate each term:\n     - \\(11 \\times 13^1 = 11 \\times 13 = 143\\)\n     - \\(6 \\times 13^0 = 6 \\times 1 = 6\\)\n   - Add these values to get the decimal equivalent:\n     \\[\n     143 + 6 = 149\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, \"b6\" in base-13 is 149 in decimal.\n\n3. **Convert Decimal to Base-5**:\n   - We need to convert the decimal number 149 to base-5.\n   - Divide the number by 5 and keep track of the remainders:\n     - \\(149 \\div 5 = 29\\) with a remainder of 4.\n     - \\(29 \\div 5 = 5\\) with a remainder of 4.\n     - \\(5 \\div 5 = 1\\) with a remainder of 0.\n     - \\(1 \\div 5 = 0\\) with a remainder of 1.\n   - The remainders, read from bottom to top, give the base-5 number: 1044.\n\n4. **Final Answer**: The base-5 representation of the base-13 number \"b6\" is 1044.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1044>>>"
