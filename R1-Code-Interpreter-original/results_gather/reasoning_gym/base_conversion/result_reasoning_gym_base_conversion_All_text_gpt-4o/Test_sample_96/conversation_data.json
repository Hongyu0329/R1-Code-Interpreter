    "To convert the base-15 number 442 to base-5, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's break it down:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Base-15 Number\nThe number 442 in base-15 means:\n- The rightmost digit is in the \\(15^0\\) place.\n- The middle digit is in the \\(15^1\\) place.\n- The leftmost digit is in the \\(15^2\\) place.\n\nSo, the base-15 number 442 can be expanded as:\n\\[ 4 \\times 15^2 + 4 \\times 15^1 + 2 \\times 15^0 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Convert Base-15 to Base-10\nCalculate the value of each term:\n- \\(4 \\times 15^2 = 4 \\times 225 = 900\\)\n- \\(4 \\times 15^1 = 4 \\times 15 = 60\\)\n- \\(2 \\times 15^0 = 2 \\times 1 = 2\\)\n\nAdd these values together to get the base-10 equivalent:\n\\[ 900 + 60 + 2 = 962 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Convert Base-10 to Base-5\nNow, we need to convert the base-10 number 962 to base-5. We do this by repeatedly dividing the number by 5 and keeping track of the remainders.\n\n1. Divide 962 by 5:\n   - Quotient: 192\n   - Remainder: 2\n\n2. Divide 192 by 5:\n   - Quotient: 38\n   - Remainder: 2\n\n3. Divide 38 by 5:\n   - Quotient: 7\n   - Remainder: 3\n\n4. Divide 7 by 5:\n   - Quotient: 1\n   - Remainder: 2\n\n5. Divide 1 by 5:\n   - Quotient: 0\n   - Remainder: 1\n\n### Step 4: Read the Remainders in Reverse Order\nThe base-5 number is obtained by reading the remainders from last to first:\n\\[ 12322_5 \\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe base-15 number 442 is equivalent to the base-5 number 12322.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<12322>>>"
