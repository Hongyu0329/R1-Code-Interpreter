    "To convert the binary number 1111010110 to base-15, we need to follow a series of steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input and Output Bases:**\n   - The input number is in binary (base-2).\n   - The target base is base-15.\n\n2. **Convert the Binary Number to Decimal:**\n   - The binary number 1111010110 can be converted to decimal by evaluating each bit's contribution based on its position.\n   - Starting from the rightmost bit (least significant bit), each bit represents a power of 2.\n   - Calculate the decimal value:\n     - \\(1 \\times 2^9 = 512\\)\n     - \\(1 \\times 2^8 = 256\\)\n     - \\(1 \\times 2^7 = 128\\)\n     - \\(1 \\times 2^6 = 64\\)\n     - \\(0 \\times 2^5 = 0\\)\n     - \\(1 \\times 2^4 = 16\\)\n     - \\(0 \\times 2^3 = 0\\)\n     - \\(1 \\times 2^2 = 4\\)\n     - \\(1 \\times 2^1 = 2\\)\n     - \\(0 \\times 2^0 = 0\\)\n   - Sum these values: \\(512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 0 + 16 + 0 + 4 + 2 + 0 = 982\\).\n\n3. **Convert the Decimal Number to Base-15:**\n   - Now, convert the decimal number 982 to base-15.\n   - Divide the number by 15 and record the remainder. This remainder is the least significant digit in base-15.\n   - Continue dividing the quotient by 15 until the quotient is zero, recording each remainder.\n   - Perform the division:\n     - \\(982 \\div 15 = 65\\) remainder \\(7\\)\n     - \\(65 \\div 15 = 4\\) remainder \\(5\\)\n     - \\(4 \\div 15 = 0\\) remainder \\(4\\)\n   - The remainders, read from last to first, give the base-15 number: 457.\n\n4. **Format the Answer:**\n   - The base-15 number is 457, which uses digits 4, 5, and 7, all of which are less than 10, so no letters are needed.\n\nThe final answer is formatted as requested:\n\n<<<457>>>"
