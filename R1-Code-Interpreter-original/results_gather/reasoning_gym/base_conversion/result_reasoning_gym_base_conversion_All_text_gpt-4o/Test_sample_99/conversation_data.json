    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to convert the base-7 number \"641\" to a base-14 number. In base-7, the digits range from 0 to 6, and in base-14, the digits range from 0 to 9 and then from 'a' to 'd' for values 10 to 13.\n\n2. **Convert Base-7 to Decimal**: \n   - The number \"641\" in base-7 can be expanded as:\n     - \\(6 \\times 7^2 + 4 \\times 7^1 + 1 \\times 7^0\\)\n   - Calculate each term:\n     - \\(6 \\times 7^2 = 6 \\times 49 = 294\\)\n     - \\(4 \\times 7^1 = 4 \\times 7 = 28\\)\n     - \\(1 \\times 7^0 = 1 \\times 1 = 1\\)\n   - Add these values together to get the decimal equivalent:\n     - \\(294 + 28 + 1 = 323\\)\n\n3. **Convert Decimal to Base-14**:\n   - We now need to convert the decimal number 323 to base-14.\n   - Divide the number by 14 and keep track of the remainders:\n     - \\(323 \\div 14 = 23\\) remainder \\(1\\)\n     - \\(23 \\div 14 = 1\\) remainder \\(9\\)\n     - \\(1 \\div 14 = 0\\) remainder \\(1\\)\n   - The remainders give us the digits of the base-14 number, starting from the last remainder to the first:\n     - The base-14 number is \"191\".\n\n4. **Final Answer**: The base-7 number \"641\" is equivalent to the base-14 number \"191\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<191>>>"
