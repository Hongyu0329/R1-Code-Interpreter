    "To convert the base-14 number \"a8\" to base-9, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's break it down:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Base-14 Number\n- The number \"a8\" is in base-14.\n- In base-14, the digits range from 0 to 9 and then continue with letters a, b, c, ..., up to d, which represent values 10, 11, 12, ..., up to 13 respectively.\n- Therefore, in base-14, 'a' represents 10 and '8' represents 8.\n\n### Step 2: Convert Base-14 to Base-10\nTo convert the number from base-14 to base-10, we use the positional value method:\n- The rightmost digit is the least significant digit (LSD), and its position is 0.\n- The next digit to the left is more significant, and its position is 1, and so on.\n\nFor \"a8\" in base-14:\n- 'a' is in the 14^1 position, and '8' is in the 14^0 position.\n\nCalculate the base-10 equivalent:\n- Value of 'a' in base-10: 10 * (14^1) = 10 * 14 = 140\n- Value of '8' in base-10: 8 * (14^0) = 8 * 1 = 8\n\nAdd these values together to get the base-10 equivalent:\n- Base-10 value = 140 + 8 = 148\n\n### Step 3: Convert Base-10 to Base-9\nNow, we need to convert the base-10 number 148 to base-9.\n\nTo do this, we repeatedly divide the number by 9 and keep track of the remainders:\n1. Divide 148 by 9:\n   - 148 รท 9 = 16 with a remainder of 4\n2. Divide the quotient 16 by 9:\n   - 16 รท 9 = 1 with a remainder of 7\n3. Divide the quotient 1 by 9:\n   - 1 รท 9 = 0 with a remainder of 1\n\nThe base-9 number is formed by the remainders read from bottom to top:\n- Base-9 number = 174\n\n### Final Answer\nThe base-14 number \"a8\" is equivalent to the base-9 number \"174\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<174>>>"
