    "To convert the base-4 number 32213 to base-9, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's break it down:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Base-4 Number\nThe number 32213 in base-4 means:\n- The rightmost digit is the least significant digit (LSD).\n- Each digit represents a power of 4, starting from 0 on the right.\n\n### Step 2: Convert Base-4 to Base-10\nTo convert the base-4 number to base-10, we multiply each digit by 4 raised to the power of its position (starting from 0 on the right) and sum them up.\n\n- \\(3 \\times 4^4 = 3 \\times 256 = 768\\)\n- \\(2 \\times 4^3 = 2 \\times 64 = 128\\)\n- \\(2 \\times 4^2 = 2 \\times 16 = 32\\)\n- \\(1 \\times 4^1 = 1 \\times 4 = 4\\)\n- \\(3 \\times 4^0 = 3 \\times 1 = 3\\)\n\nAdd these values together to get the base-10 equivalent:\n\\[768 + 128 + 32 + 4 + 3 = 935\\]\n\n### Step 3: Convert Base-10 to Base-9\nNow, we need to convert the base-10 number 935 to base-9.\n\n1. **Divide 935 by 9**:\n   - Quotient: 103\n   - Remainder: 8 (this is the least significant digit in base-9)\n\n2. **Divide 103 by 9**:\n   - Quotient: 11\n   - Remainder: 4\n\n3. **Divide 11 by 9**:\n   - Quotient: 1\n   - Remainder: 2\n\n4. **Divide 1 by 9**:\n   - Quotient: 0\n   - Remainder: 1 (this is the most significant digit in base-9)\n\n### Step 4: Compile the Base-9 Number\nThe remainders from the division steps give us the digits of the base-9 number, starting from the last remainder to the first:\n- The base-9 number is 1248.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe base-4 number 32213 is equivalent to the base-9 number 1248.\n\n<<<1248>>>"
