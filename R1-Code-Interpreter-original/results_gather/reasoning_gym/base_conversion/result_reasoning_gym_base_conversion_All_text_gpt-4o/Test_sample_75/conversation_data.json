    "To convert the base-11 number \"20a\" to base-14, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's break it down:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Input\n- The number \"20a\" is in base-11.\n- In base-11, the digits range from 0 to 10, where 'a' represents 10.\n\n### Step 2: Convert Base-11 to Base-10\nTo convert a number from base-11 to base-10, we multiply each digit by 11 raised to the power of its position (counting from right to left, starting at 0).\n\n- The number \"20a\" in base-11 can be broken down as:\n  - '2' is in the hundreds place (11^2)\n  - '0' is in the tens place (11^1)\n  - 'a' (which is 10) is in the units place (11^0)\n\nThe base-10 conversion is calculated as follows:\n- \\(2 \\times 11^2 = 2 \\times 121 = 242\\)\n- \\(0 \\times 11^1 = 0 \\times 11 = 0\\)\n- \\(10 \\times 11^0 = 10 \\times 1 = 10\\)\n\nAdd these values together to get the base-10 equivalent:\n- \\(242 + 0 + 10 = 252\\)\n\n### Step 3: Convert Base-10 to Base-14\nNow, we need to convert the base-10 number 252 to base-14.\n\n- Divide the number by 14 and keep track of the quotient and remainder.\n- Continue dividing the quotient by 14 until the quotient is 0.\n- The remainders, read in reverse order, give the base-14 number.\n\nPerform the division:\n1. \\(252 \\div 14 = 18\\) with a remainder of \\(0\\)\n2. \\(18 \\div 14 = 1\\) with a remainder of \\(4\\)\n3. \\(1 \\div 14 = 0\\) with a remainder of \\(1\\)\n\nReading the remainders from last to first, we get the base-14 number: \"140\".\n\n### Final Answer\nThe base-11 number \"20a\" converts to \"140\" in base-14.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<140>>>"
