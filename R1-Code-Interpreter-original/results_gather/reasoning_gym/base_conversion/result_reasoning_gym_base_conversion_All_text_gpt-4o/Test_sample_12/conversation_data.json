    "To convert a base-10 number to another base, we need to repeatedly divide the number by the new base and keep track of the remainders. These remainders represent the digits in the new base, starting from the least significant digit (rightmost) to the most significant digit (leftmost).\n\nLet's convert the base-10 number 418 to base-13 step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Number**: 418\n2. **Target Base**: 13\n\n**Step-by-Step Conversion**:\n\n1. **Divide 418 by 13**:\n   - Quotient: 418 รท 13 = 32\n   - Remainder: 418 % 13 = 2\n   - The remainder (2) is the least significant digit in base-13.\n\n2. **Divide the Quotient (32) by 13**:\n   - Quotient: 32 รท 13 = 2\n   - Remainder: 32 % 13 = 6\n   - The remainder (6) is the next digit in base-13.\n\n3. **Divide the Quotient (2) by 13**:\n   - Quotient: 2 รท 13 = 0\n   - Remainder: 2 % 13 = 2\n   - The remainder (2) is the most significant digit in base-13.\n\nNow, we have all the digits from the least significant to the most significant: 2, 6, 2.\n\nTherefore, the base-13 representation of the base-10 number 418 is read from the most significant digit to the least significant digit, which is 262.\n\n**Final Answer**:\n<<<262>>>"
