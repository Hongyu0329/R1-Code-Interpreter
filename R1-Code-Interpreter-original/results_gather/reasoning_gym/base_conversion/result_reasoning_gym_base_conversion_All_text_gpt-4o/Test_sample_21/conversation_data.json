    "To convert the base-15 number \"2c1\" to hexadecimal, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the Bases**:\n   - Base-15 uses digits 0-9 and letters a-e to represent values 0-14.\n   - Hexadecimal (base-16) uses digits 0-9 and letters a-f to represent values 0-15.\n\n2. **Convert Base-15 to Decimal**:\n   - The number \"2c1\" in base-15 can be expanded as:\n     - \\(2 \\times 15^2 + c \\times 15^1 + 1 \\times 15^0\\)\n   - Here, 'c' in base-15 is equivalent to 12 in decimal.\n   - Calculate each term:\n     - \\(2 \\times 15^2 = 2 \\times 225 = 450\\)\n     - \\(c \\times 15^1 = 12 \\times 15 = 180\\)\n     - \\(1 \\times 15^0 = 1 \\times 1 = 1\\)\n   - Sum these values to get the decimal equivalent:\n     - \\(450 + 180 + 1 = 631\\)\n\n3. **Convert Decimal to Hexadecimal**:\n   - Now, convert the decimal number 631 to hexadecimal.\n   - Divide 631 by 16 and find the remainder:\n     - \\(631 \\div 16 = 39\\) remainder \\(7\\)\n   - Divide the quotient 39 by 16:\n     - \\(39 \\div 16 = 2\\) remainder \\(7\\)\n   - Divide the quotient 2 by 16:\n     - \\(2 \\div 16 = 0\\) remainder \\(2\\)\n   - The remainders give the hexadecimal number when read from bottom to top: 277.\n\n4. **Final Answer**:\n   - The base-15 number \"2c1\" is equivalent to \"277\" in hexadecimal.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<277>>>"
