    "To convert the base-11 number 397 to hexadecimal, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to convert a number from base-11 to base-16 (hexadecimal). Base-11 uses digits 0-9 and 'a' for 10. Hexadecimal uses digits 0-9 and 'a' to 'f' for 10 to 15.\n\n2. **Convert Base-11 to Base-10**: \n   - The number 397 in base-11 can be expanded as:\n     - \\(3 \\times 11^2 + 9 \\times 11^1 + 7 \\times 11^0\\)\n   - Calculate each term:\n     - \\(3 \\times 11^2 = 3 \\times 121 = 363\\)\n     - \\(9 \\times 11^1 = 9 \\times 11 = 99\\)\n     - \\(7 \\times 11^0 = 7 \\times 1 = 7\\)\n   - Add these values together to get the base-10 equivalent:\n     - \\(363 + 99 + 7 = 469\\)\n\n3. **Convert Base-10 to Base-16**:\n   - Now, convert the base-10 number 469 to hexadecimal.\n   - Divide 469 by 16 and find the quotient and remainder:\n     - \\(469 \\div 16 = 29\\) remainder \\(5\\)\n   - The remainder is the least significant digit (rightmost) in the hexadecimal number.\n   - Now, take the quotient 29 and divide by 16:\n     - \\(29 \\div 16 = 1\\) remainder \\(13\\)\n   - The remainder 13 corresponds to 'd' in hexadecimal.\n   - Finally, take the quotient 1 and divide by 16:\n     - \\(1 \\div 16 = 0\\) remainder \\(1\\)\n   - The remainder 1 is the most significant digit (leftmost) in the hexadecimal number.\n\n4. **Combine the Hexadecimal Digits**:\n   - From the divisions, we have the remainders 1, 13 ('d'), and 5.\n   - Therefore, the hexadecimal representation is 1d5.\n\n5. **Final Answer**:\n   - The base-11 number 397 is equivalent to the hexadecimal number 1d5.\n\n<<<1d5>>>"
