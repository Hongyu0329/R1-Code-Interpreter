    "To convert the base-7 number 1402 to base-11, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's break it down:\n\n### Step 1: Convert the Base-7 Number to Base-10\n\nThe first step is to convert the number from base-7 to base-10. The number 1402 in base-7 can be expanded as follows:\n\n- The rightmost digit is the least significant digit (LSD), and the leftmost is the most significant digit (MSD).\n- Each digit is multiplied by 7 raised to the power of its position index, starting from 0 on the right.\n\nSo, the base-10 conversion is calculated as:\n\n\\[ 1402_{7} = 1 \\times 7^3 + 4 \\times 7^2 + 0 \\times 7^1 + 2 \\times 7^0 \\]\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n- \\( 1 \\times 7^3 = 1 \\times 343 = 343 \\)\n- \\( 4 \\times 7^2 = 4 \\times 49 = 196 \\)\n- \\( 0 \\times 7^1 = 0 \\times 7 = 0 \\)\n- \\( 2 \\times 7^0 = 2 \\times 1 = 2 \\)\n\nAdding these values together gives:\n\n\\[ 343 + 196 + 0 + 2 = 541 \\]\n\nSo, the base-10 equivalent of 1402 in base-7 is 541.\n\n### Step 2: Convert the Base-10 Number to Base-11\n\nNow, we need to convert the base-10 number 541 to base-11. This involves dividing the number by 11 and keeping track of the remainders.\n\n1. Divide 541 by 11:\n   - \\( 541 \\div 11 = 49 \\) remainder \\( 2 \\)\n\n2. Divide the quotient (49) by 11:\n   - \\( 49 \\div 11 = 4 \\) remainder \\( 5 \\)\n\n3. Divide the quotient (4) by 11:\n   - \\( 4 \\div 11 = 0 \\) remainder \\( 4 \\)\n\nSince the quotient is now 0, we stop here. The remainders give us the digits of the base-11 number, read from bottom to top.\n\nThus, the base-11 representation of 541 is \\( 452_{11} \\).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe base-7 number 1402 is equivalent to the base-11 number 452.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<452>>>"
