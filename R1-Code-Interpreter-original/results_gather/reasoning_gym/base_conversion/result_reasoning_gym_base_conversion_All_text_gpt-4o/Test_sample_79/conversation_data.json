    "To convert the base-5 number 11342 to hexadecimal, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We are given a number in base-5 and need to convert it to base-16 (hexadecimal). In base-16, digits above 9 are represented by letters a-f.\n\n2. **Convert Base-5 to Base-10**: \n   - The base-5 number 11342 can be expanded as:\n     \\[\n     1 \\times 5^4 + 1 \\times 5^3 + 3 \\times 5^2 + 4 \\times 5^1 + 2 \\times 5^0\n     \\]\n   - Calculate each term:\n     - \\(1 \\times 5^4 = 1 \\times 625 = 625\\)\n     - \\(1 \\times 5^3 = 1 \\times 125 = 125\\)\n     - \\(3 \\times 5^2 = 3 \\times 25 = 75\\)\n     - \\(4 \\times 5^1 = 4 \\times 5 = 20\\)\n     - \\(2 \\times 5^0 = 2 \\times 1 = 2\\)\n   - Sum these values to get the base-10 equivalent:\n     \\[\n     625 + 125 + 75 + 20 + 2 = 847\n     \\]\n\n3. **Convert Base-10 to Base-16**:\n   - We need to convert the decimal number 847 to hexadecimal.\n   - Divide 847 by 16 and find the quotient and remainder:\n     - \\(847 \\div 16 = 52\\) remainder \\(15\\) (15 in hexadecimal is 'f')\n   - Divide the quotient 52 by 16:\n     - \\(52 \\div 16 = 3\\) remainder \\(4\\)\n   - Divide the quotient 3 by 16:\n     - \\(3 \\div 16 = 0\\) remainder \\(3\\)\n   - The remainders give us the hexadecimal number from least significant to most significant digit: 3, 4, f.\n\n4. **Combine the Hexadecimal Digits**:\n   - Read the remainders from last to first to get the hexadecimal number: 34f.\n\nTherefore, the base-5 number 11342 is equivalent to the hexadecimal number 34f.\n\nFinal answer: <<<34f>>>"
