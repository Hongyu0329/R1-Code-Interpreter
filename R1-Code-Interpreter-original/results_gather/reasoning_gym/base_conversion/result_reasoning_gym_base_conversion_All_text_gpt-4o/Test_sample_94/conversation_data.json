    "To convert the binary number 1001001010 to base-11, we need to follow a series of steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input and Output Bases:**\n   - The input number is in binary (base-2).\n   - The target base is base-11.\n\n2. **Convert the Binary Number to Decimal:**\n   - The binary number 1001001010 needs to be converted to a decimal (base-10) number first.\n   - Each digit in the binary number represents a power of 2, starting from the rightmost digit (which is 2^0).\n\n   Let's break it down:\n   - The binary number is 1001001010.\n   - From right to left, the powers of 2 are: 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, ..., 2^9.\n   - Calculate the decimal value:\n     - 1 * 2^9 = 512\n     - 0 * 2^8 = 0\n     - 0 * 2^7 = 0\n     - 1 * 2^6 = 64\n     - 0 * 2^5 = 0\n     - 0 * 2^4 = 0\n     - 1 * 2^3 = 8\n     - 0 * 2^2 = 0\n     - 1 * 2^1 = 2\n     - 0 * 2^0 = 0\n\n   - Sum these values: 512 + 0 + 0 + 64 + 0 + 0 + 8 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 586\n\n3. **Convert the Decimal Number to Base-11:**\n   - Now, convert the decimal number 586 to base-11.\n   - Divide the number by 11 and keep track of the remainders.\n\n   Let's perform the division:\n   - 586 รท 11 = 53 with a remainder of 3\n   - 53 รท 11 = 4 with a remainder of 9\n   - 4 รท 11 = 0 with a remainder of 4\n\n   - The remainders, read from bottom to top, give the base-11 number: 493\n\n4. **Format the Final Answer:**\n   - The base-11 number is 493.\n\nTherefore, the binary number 1001001010 converted to base-11 is:\n\n<<<493>>>"
