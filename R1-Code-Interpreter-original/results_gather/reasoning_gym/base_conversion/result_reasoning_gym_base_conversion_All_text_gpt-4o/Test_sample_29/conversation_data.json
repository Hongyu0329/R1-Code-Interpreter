    "To convert a number from base-4 to base-10, we need to understand the positional value of each digit in the base-4 number. Each digit in a base-4 number represents a power of 4, starting from the rightmost digit which is 4^0, then 4^1, 4^2, and so on, moving left.\n\nLet's break down the conversion of the base-4 number 13322 to base-10 step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the digits and their positions:**\n   - The number 13322 in base-4 has the following digits from left to right: 1, 3, 3, 2, 2.\n\n2. **Assign powers of 4 to each digit based on its position:**\n   - The rightmost digit (2) is in the 4^0 position.\n   - The next digit to the left (2) is in the 4^1 position.\n   - The next digit (3) is in the 4^2 position.\n   - The next digit (3) is in the 4^3 position.\n   - The leftmost digit (1) is in the 4^4 position.\n\n3. **Calculate the value of each digit:**\n   - The rightmost digit: 2 * 4^0 = 2 * 1 = 2\n   - The next digit: 2 * 4^1 = 2 * 4 = 8\n   - The next digit: 3 * 4^2 = 3 * 16 = 48\n   - The next digit: 3 * 4^3 = 3 * 64 = 192\n   - The leftmost digit: 1 * 4^4 = 1 * 256 = 256\n\n4. **Sum the values to get the base-10 equivalent:**\n   - Total = 2 + 8 + 48 + 192 + 256 = 506\n\nTherefore, the base-10 equivalent of the base-4 number 13322 is 506.\n\n<<<506>>>"
