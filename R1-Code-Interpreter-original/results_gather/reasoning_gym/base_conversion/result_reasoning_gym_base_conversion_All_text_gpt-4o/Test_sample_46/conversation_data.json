    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to convert the base-5 number 11314 to a base-3 number.\n\n2. **Convert the Base-5 Number to Decimal**: \n   - The base-5 number 11314 can be expanded as:\n     \\[\n     1 \\times 5^4 + 1 \\times 5^3 + 3 \\times 5^2 + 1 \\times 5^1 + 4 \\times 5^0\n     \\]\n   - Calculate each term:\n     - \\(1 \\times 5^4 = 1 \\times 625 = 625\\)\n     - \\(1 \\times 5^3 = 1 \\times 125 = 125\\)\n     - \\(3 \\times 5^2 = 3 \\times 25 = 75\\)\n     - \\(1 \\times 5^1 = 1 \\times 5 = 5\\)\n     - \\(4 \\times 5^0 = 4 \\times 1 = 4\\)\n   - Sum these values to get the decimal equivalent:\n     \\[\n     625 + 125 + 75 + 5 + 4 = 834\n     \\]\n\n3. **Convert the Decimal Number to Base-3**:\n   - We need to express 834 in base-3.\n   - Divide 834 by 3 and keep track of the remainders:\n     - \\(834 \\div 3 = 278\\) remainder \\(0\\)\n     - \\(278 \\div 3 = 92\\) remainder \\(2\\)\n     - \\(92 \\div 3 = 30\\) remainder \\(2\\)\n     - \\(30 \\div 3 = 10\\) remainder \\(0\\)\n     - \\(10 \\div 3 = 3\\) remainder \\(1\\)\n     - \\(3 \\div 3 = 1\\) remainder \\(0\\)\n     - \\(1 \\div 3 = 0\\) remainder \\(1\\)\n   - The base-3 number is read from the last remainder to the first: \\(1022002_3\\).\n\n4. **Final Answer**: The base-3 equivalent of the base-5 number 11314 is 1022002.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1022002>>>"
