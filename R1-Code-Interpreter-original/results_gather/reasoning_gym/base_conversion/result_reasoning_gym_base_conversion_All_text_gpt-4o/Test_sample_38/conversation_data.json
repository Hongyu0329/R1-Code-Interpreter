    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to convert the base-3 number `1021111` to a base-6 number.\n\n2. **Convert Base-3 to Decimal**: \n   - Each digit in a base-3 number represents a power of 3, starting from the rightmost digit which is 3^0.\n   - The number `1021111` in base-3 can be expanded as:\n     - \\(1 \\times 3^6\\)\n     - \\(0 \\times 3^5\\)\n     - \\(2 \\times 3^4\\)\n     - \\(1 \\times 3^3\\)\n     - \\(1 \\times 3^2\\)\n     - \\(1 \\times 3^1\\)\n     - \\(1 \\times 3^0\\)\n\n   - Calculate each term:\n     - \\(1 \\times 3^6 = 729\\)\n     - \\(0 \\times 3^5 = 0\\)\n     - \\(2 \\times 3^4 = 162\\)\n     - \\(1 \\times 3^3 = 27\\)\n     - \\(1 \\times 3^2 = 9\\)\n     - \\(1 \\times 3^1 = 3\\)\n     - \\(1 \\times 3^0 = 1\\)\n\n   - Sum these values to get the decimal equivalent:\n     - \\(729 + 0 + 162 + 27 + 9 + 3 + 1 = 931\\)\n\n3. **Convert Decimal to Base-6**:\n   - Divide the decimal number by 6 and record the remainder.\n   - Continue dividing the quotient by 6 until the quotient is 0, recording each remainder.\n   - The base-6 number is the remainders read from bottom to top.\n\n   - Perform the division:\n     - \\(931 \\div 6 = 155\\) remainder \\(1\\)\n     - \\(155 \\div 6 = 25\\) remainder \\(5\\)\n     - \\(25 \\div 6 = 4\\) remainder \\(1\\)\n     - \\(4 \\div 6 = 0\\) remainder \\(4\\)\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top gives us the base-6 number: `4151`.\n\n4. **Final Answer**: The base-3 number `1021111` is equivalent to the base-6 number `4151`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<4151>>>"
