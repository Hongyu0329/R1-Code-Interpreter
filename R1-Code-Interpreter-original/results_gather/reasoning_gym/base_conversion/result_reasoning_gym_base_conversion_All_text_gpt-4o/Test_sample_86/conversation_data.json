    "To convert the base-12 number 508 to base-4, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's break it down:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Base-12 Number\nThe number 508 in base-12 means:\n- 5 in the hundreds place (12^2)\n- 0 in the tens place (12^1)\n- 8 in the ones place (12^0)\n\n### Step 2: Convert Base-12 to Base-10\nFirst, convert the base-12 number to a base-10 number. This is done by multiplying each digit by its place value and summing the results.\n\n\\[ 508_{12} = 5 \\times 12^2 + 0 \\times 12^1 + 8 \\times 12^0 \\]\n\nCalculate each term:\n- \\( 5 \\times 12^2 = 5 \\times 144 = 720 \\)\n- \\( 0 \\times 12^1 = 0 \\times 12 = 0 \\)\n- \\( 8 \\times 12^0 = 8 \\times 1 = 8 \\)\n\nAdd these values together:\n\\[ 720 + 0 + 8 = 728 \\]\n\nSo, 508 in base-12 is equivalent to 728 in base-10.\n\n### Step 3: Convert Base-10 to Base-4\nNow, convert the base-10 number 728 to base-4. This involves dividing the number by 4 and keeping track of the remainders.\n\n1. Divide 728 by 4:\n   - 728 ÷ 4 = 182, remainder 0\n\n2. Divide 182 by 4:\n   - 182 ÷ 4 = 45, remainder 2\n\n3. Divide 45 by 4:\n   - 45 ÷ 4 = 11, remainder 1\n\n4. Divide 11 by 4:\n   - 11 ÷ 4 = 2, remainder 3\n\n5. Divide 2 by 4:\n   - 2 ÷ 4 = 0, remainder 2\n\nNow, read the remainders from bottom to top to get the base-4 number.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe base-4 representation of the base-12 number 508 is 23120.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<23120>>>"
