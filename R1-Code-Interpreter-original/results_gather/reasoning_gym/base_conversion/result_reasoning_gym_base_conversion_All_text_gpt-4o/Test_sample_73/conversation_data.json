    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to convert the number 748 from base-11 to base-7.\n\n2. **Convert the Base-11 Number to Base-10**:\n   - The number 748 in base-11 can be expanded as:\n     \\[\n     7 \\times 11^2 + 4 \\times 11^1 + 8 \\times 11^0\n     \\]\n   - Calculate each term:\n     - \\(7 \\times 11^2 = 7 \\times 121 = 847\\)\n     - \\(4 \\times 11^1 = 4 \\times 11 = 44\\)\n     - \\(8 \\times 11^0 = 8 \\times 1 = 8\\)\n   - Sum these values to get the base-10 equivalent:\n     \\[\n     847 + 44 + 8 = 899\n     \\]\n   - So, 748 in base-11 is 899 in base-10.\n\n3. **Convert the Base-10 Number to Base-7**:\n   - We need to convert 899 from base-10 to base-7.\n   - Divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders:\n     - \\(899 \\div 7 = 128\\) remainder \\(3\\)\n     - \\(128 \\div 7 = 18\\) remainder \\(2\\)\n     - \\(18 \\div 7 = 2\\) remainder \\(4\\)\n     - \\(2 \\div 7 = 0\\) remainder \\(2\\)\n   - The remainders, read from bottom to top, give the base-7 number.\n\n4. **Compile the Base-7 Number**:\n   - The remainders from the division process are 2, 4, 2, and 3.\n   - Therefore, the base-7 representation of 899 is 2423.\n\n5. **Final Answer**:\n   - The base-11 number 748 is equivalent to the base-7 number 2423.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<2423>>>"
