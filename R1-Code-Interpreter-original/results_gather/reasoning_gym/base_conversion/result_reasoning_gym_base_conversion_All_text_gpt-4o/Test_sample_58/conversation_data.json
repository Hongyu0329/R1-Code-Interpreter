    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to convert the number 130 from base-13 to base-3.\n\n2. **Convert the Base-13 Number to Decimal**:\n   - The number 130 in base-13 can be expanded as:\n     \\[\n     1 \\times 13^2 + 3 \\times 13^1 + 0 \\times 13^0\n     \\]\n   - Calculate each term:\n     - \\(1 \\times 13^2 = 1 \\times 169 = 169\\)\n     - \\(3 \\times 13^1 = 3 \\times 13 = 39\\)\n     - \\(0 \\times 13^0 = 0 \\times 1 = 0\\)\n   - Add these values together to get the decimal equivalent:\n     \\[\n     169 + 39 + 0 = 208\n     \\]\n   - So, the decimal equivalent of 130 in base-13 is 208.\n\n3. **Convert the Decimal Number to Base-3**:\n   - We need to convert the decimal number 208 to base-3.\n   - Divide the number by 3 and keep track of the remainders:\n     - \\(208 \\div 3 = 69\\) remainder \\(1\\)\n     - \\(69 \\div 3 = 23\\) remainder \\(0\\)\n     - \\(23 \\div 3 = 7\\) remainder \\(2\\)\n     - \\(7 \\div 3 = 2\\) remainder \\(1\\)\n     - \\(2 \\div 3 = 0\\) remainder \\(2\\)\n   - The remainders, read from bottom to top, give the base-3 number: 21021.\n\n4. **Final Answer**:\n   - The base-3 equivalent of the base-13 number 130 is 21021.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<21021>>>"
