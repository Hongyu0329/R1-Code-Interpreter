    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to convert the base-6 number 4220 to a base-4 number.\n\n2. **Convert the Base-6 Number to Decimal**: \n   - The base-6 number 4220 can be expanded as:\n     \\[\n     4 \\times 6^3 + 2 \\times 6^2 + 2 \\times 6^1 + 0 \\times 6^0\n     \\]\n   - Calculate each term:\n     - \\(4 \\times 6^3 = 4 \\times 216 = 864\\)\n     - \\(2 \\times 6^2 = 2 \\times 36 = 72\\)\n     - \\(2 \\times 6^1 = 2 \\times 6 = 12\\)\n     - \\(0 \\times 6^0 = 0 \\times 1 = 0\\)\n   - Sum these values to get the decimal equivalent:\n     \\[\n     864 + 72 + 12 + 0 = 948\n     \\]\n\n3. **Convert the Decimal Number to Base-4**:\n   - We need to express 948 in base-4.\n   - Divide 948 by 4 and keep track of the remainders:\n     - \\(948 \\div 4 = 237\\) remainder \\(0\\)\n     - \\(237 \\div 4 = 59\\) remainder \\(1\\)\n     - \\(59 \\div 4 = 14\\) remainder \\(3\\)\n     - \\(14 \\div 4 = 3\\) remainder \\(2\\)\n     - \\(3 \\div 4 = 0\\) remainder \\(3\\)\n   - The remainders, read from bottom to top, give the base-4 number: 32310.\n\n4. **Final Answer**: The base-4 representation of the base-6 number 4220 is 32310.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<32310>>>"
