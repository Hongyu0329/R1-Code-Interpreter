    "To convert the binary number 101010000 to base-14, we need to follow a series of steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input and Output Bases:**\n   - The input number is in binary (base-2).\n   - The target base is base-14.\n\n2. **Convert the Binary Number to Decimal:**\n   - The binary number 101010000 can be expanded as follows:\n     - \\(1 \\times 2^8 + 0 \\times 2^7 + 1 \\times 2^6 + 0 \\times 2^5 + 1 \\times 2^4 + 0 \\times 2^3 + 0 \\times 2^2 + 0 \\times 2^1 + 0 \\times 2^0\\)\n   - Calculate each term:\n     - \\(1 \\times 2^8 = 256\\)\n     - \\(0 \\times 2^7 = 0\\)\n     - \\(1 \\times 2^6 = 64\\)\n     - \\(0 \\times 2^5 = 0\\)\n     - \\(1 \\times 2^4 = 16\\)\n     - \\(0 \\times 2^3 = 0\\)\n     - \\(0 \\times 2^2 = 0\\)\n     - \\(0 \\times 2^1 = 0\\)\n     - \\(0 \\times 2^0 = 0\\)\n   - Sum these values to get the decimal equivalent:\n     - \\(256 + 0 + 64 + 0 + 16 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 336\\)\n\n3. **Convert the Decimal Number to Base-14:**\n   - Start with the decimal number 336.\n   - Divide the number by 14 and keep track of the quotient and remainder.\n   - Continue dividing the quotient by 14 until the quotient is 0.\n   - The remainders, read in reverse order, give the base-14 representation.\n   - Perform the division:\n     - \\(336 \\div 14 = 24\\) with a remainder of \\(0\\)\n     - \\(24 \\div 14 = 1\\) with a remainder of \\(10\\)\n     - \\(1 \\div 14 = 0\\) with a remainder of \\(1\\)\n   - The remainders are 0, 10, and 1.\n   - In base-14, the digit 10 is represented by the letter 'a'.\n\n4. **Compile the Base-14 Number:**\n   - Read the remainders from last to first: 1, 10, 0.\n   - Convert the remainders to base-14 digits: 1, a, 0.\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   - The base-14 representation of the binary number 101010000 is 1a0.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1a0>>>"
