    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to convert the number 55 from base-14 to base-11.\n\n2. **Convert the Base-14 Number to Base-10**:\n   - The number 55 in base-14 means:\n     - The leftmost digit (5) is in the 14^1 place.\n     - The rightmost digit (5) is in the 14^0 place.\n   - Calculate the base-10 equivalent:\n     - \\(5 \\times 14^1 + 5 \\times 14^0\\)\n     - \\(5 \\times 14 + 5 \\times 1\\)\n     - \\(70 + 5 = 75\\)\n   - So, the base-10 equivalent of the base-14 number 55 is 75.\n\n3. **Convert the Base-10 Number to Base-11**:\n   - We need to convert the base-10 number 75 to base-11.\n   - Divide the number by 11 and keep track of the remainders:\n     - \\(75 \\div 11 = 6\\) with a remainder of 9.\n     - \\(6 \\div 11 = 0\\) with a remainder of 6.\n   - The remainders give us the digits of the base-11 number, starting from the last remainder to the first.\n   - Therefore, the base-11 representation is 69.\n\n4. **Final Answer**:\n   - The base-14 number 55 is equivalent to the base-11 number 69.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<69>>>"
