    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the base-7 number to a decimal (base-10) number.**\n\n   The base-7 number given is 1431. To convert it to a decimal number, we need to multiply each digit by 7 raised to the power of its position, starting from the right (0-indexed).\n\n   - The rightmost digit is 1, and its position is 0: \\(1 \\times 7^0 = 1\\).\n   - The next digit is 3, and its position is 1: \\(3 \\times 7^1 = 21\\).\n   - The next digit is 4, and its position is 2: \\(4 \\times 7^2 = 196\\).\n   - The leftmost digit is 1, and its position is 3: \\(1 \\times 7^3 = 343\\).\n\n   Add these values together to get the decimal equivalent:\n   \\[\n   1 + 21 + 196 + 343 = 561\n   \\]\n\n2. **Convert the decimal number to the target base (base-14).**\n\n   Now, we need to convert the decimal number 561 to base-14. We do this by repeatedly dividing the number by 14 and keeping track of the remainders.\n\n   - Divide 561 by 14: the quotient is 40, and the remainder is 1.\n   - Divide 40 by 14: the quotient is 2, and the remainder is 12.\n   - Divide 2 by 14: the quotient is 0, and the remainder is 2.\n\n   The remainders, read from bottom to top, give us the digits of the number in base-14. Note that in base-14, the digit 12 is represented by the letter 'c'.\n\n   Therefore, the base-14 representation of the number is 2c1.\n\n3. **Format the final answer.**\n\n   According to the required format, we need to enclose the answer in triple angle brackets.\n\n   The final answer is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{<<<2c1>>>}\n   \\]"
