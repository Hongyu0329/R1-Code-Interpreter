    "To convert a number from base-3 to base-8, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to convert a number from base-3 (ternary) to base-8 (octal). The given number is 1020200 in base-3.\n\n2. **Convert Base-3 to Base-10**: First, we convert the base-3 number to a base-10 (decimal) number. This involves multiplying each digit by 3 raised to the power of its position (counting from right to left, starting at 0).\n\n   - The base-3 number is 1020200.\n   - Break it down by position:\n     - \\(0 \\times 3^0 = 0\\)\n     - \\(0 \\times 3^1 = 0\\)\n     - \\(2 \\times 3^2 = 18\\)\n     - \\(0 \\times 3^3 = 0\\)\n     - \\(2 \\times 3^4 = 162\\)\n     - \\(0 \\times 3^5 = 0\\)\n     - \\(1 \\times 3^6 = 729\\)\n\n   - Add these values together: \\(0 + 0 + 18 + 0 + 162 + 0 + 729 = 909\\)\n\n   So, the base-10 equivalent of 1020200 in base-3 is 909.\n\n3. **Convert Base-10 to Base-8**: Now, convert the base-10 number (909) to base-8.\n\n   - Divide the number by 8 and record the remainder. Continue dividing the quotient by 8 until the quotient is 0. The base-8 number is the remainders read from bottom to top.\n\n   - \\(909 \\div 8 = 113\\) remainder \\(5\\)\n   - \\(113 \\div 8 = 14\\) remainder \\(1\\)\n   - \\(14 \\div 8 = 1\\) remainder \\(6\\)\n   - \\(1 \\div 8 = 0\\) remainder \\(1\\)\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get 1615.\n\n4. **Final Answer**: The base-8 equivalent of the base-3 number 1020200 is 1615.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1615>>>"
