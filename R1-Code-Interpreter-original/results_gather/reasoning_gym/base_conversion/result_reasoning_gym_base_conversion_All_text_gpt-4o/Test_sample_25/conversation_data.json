    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to convert the base-7 number \"61\" to a base-11 number. In base-7, the digits range from 0 to 6. In base-11, the digits range from 0 to 9 and then use letters 'a' to 'a' for 10.\n\n2. **Convert Base-7 to Decimal**: \n   - The number \"61\" in base-7 can be expanded as:\n     - \\(6 \\times 7^1 + 1 \\times 7^0\\)\n   - Calculate each term:\n     - \\(6 \\times 7^1 = 6 \\times 7 = 42\\)\n     - \\(1 \\times 7^0 = 1 \\times 1 = 1\\)\n   - Add these values together to get the decimal equivalent:\n     - \\(42 + 1 = 43\\)\n\n3. **Convert Decimal to Base-11**:\n   - We now have the decimal number 43, which we need to convert to base-11.\n   - Divide the decimal number by 11 and keep track of the quotient and remainder:\n     - \\(43 \\div 11 = 3\\) with a remainder of \\(10\\)\n   - The quotient is 3, and the remainder is 10. In base-11, the digit 10 is represented by 'a'.\n   - Since the quotient (3) is less than 11, it can be directly used as the next digit.\n   - Therefore, the base-11 representation is \"3a\".\n\n4. **Compile the Result**:\n   - The digits obtained from the conversion process are combined in the order of division, from last quotient to first remainder.\n   - Thus, the base-11 representation of the base-7 number \"61\" is \"3a\".\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<3a>>>"
