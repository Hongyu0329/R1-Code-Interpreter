    "To convert a number from base-3 to base-8, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Number in Base-3**: \n   - The given number is 111100 in base-3. \n   - In base-3, each digit represents a power of 3, starting from the rightmost digit which is 3^0.\n\n2. **Convert Base-3 to Base-10**:\n   - To convert the base-3 number to base-10, we multiply each digit by its corresponding power of 3 and sum them up.\n   - The number 111100 in base-3 can be expanded as:\n     - \\(1 \\times 3^5 + 1 \\times 3^4 + 1 \\times 3^3 + 1 \\times 3^2 + 0 \\times 3^1 + 0 \\times 3^0\\)\n   - Calculate each term:\n     - \\(1 \\times 3^5 = 243\\)\n     - \\(1 \\times 3^4 = 81\\)\n     - \\(1 \\times 3^3 = 27\\)\n     - \\(1 \\times 3^2 = 9\\)\n     - \\(0 \\times 3^1 = 0\\)\n     - \\(0 \\times 3^0 = 0\\)\n   - Sum these values: \\(243 + 81 + 27 + 9 + 0 + 0 = 360\\)\n   - Therefore, 111100 in base-3 is equal to 360 in base-10.\n\n3. **Convert Base-10 to Base-8**:\n   - Now, we need to convert the base-10 number 360 to base-8.\n   - To do this, we repeatedly divide the number by 8 and record the remainders.\n   - Divide 360 by 8:\n     - 360 รท 8 = 45 with a remainder of 0\n   - Divide 45 by 8:\n     - 45 รท 8 = 5 with a remainder of 5\n   - Divide 5 by 8:\n     - 5 รท 8 = 0 with a remainder of 5\n   - The remainders, read from bottom to top, give us the base-8 number.\n   - Therefore, 360 in base-10 is 550 in base-8.\n\n4. **Final Answer**:\n   - The base-3 number 111100 is equivalent to the base-8 number 550.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<550>>>"
