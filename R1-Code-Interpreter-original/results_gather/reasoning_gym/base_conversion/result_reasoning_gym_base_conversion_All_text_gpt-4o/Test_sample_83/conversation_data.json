    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to convert the base-6 number 4125 to a base-5 number.\n\n2. **Convert the Base-6 Number to Decimal**: \n   - The base-6 number 4125 can be expanded as:\n     \\[\n     4 \\times 6^3 + 1 \\times 6^2 + 2 \\times 6^1 + 5 \\times 6^0\n     \\]\n   - Calculate each term:\n     - \\(4 \\times 6^3 = 4 \\times 216 = 864\\)\n     - \\(1 \\times 6^2 = 1 \\times 36 = 36\\)\n     - \\(2 \\times 6^1 = 2 \\times 6 = 12\\)\n     - \\(5 \\times 6^0 = 5 \\times 1 = 5\\)\n   - Sum these values to get the decimal equivalent:\n     \\[\n     864 + 36 + 12 + 5 = 917\n     \\]\n\n3. **Convert the Decimal Number to Base-5**:\n   - We need to express 917 in base-5.\n   - Divide 917 by 5 and keep track of the remainders:\n     - \\(917 \\div 5 = 183\\) remainder \\(2\\)\n     - \\(183 \\div 5 = 36\\) remainder \\(3\\)\n     - \\(36 \\div 5 = 7\\) remainder \\(1\\)\n     - \\(7 \\div 5 = 1\\) remainder \\(2\\)\n     - \\(1 \\div 5 = 0\\) remainder \\(1\\)\n   - The base-5 number is read from the last remainder to the first: 12132.\n\n4. **Final Answer**: The base-5 representation of the base-6 number 4125 is 12132.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<12132>>>"
