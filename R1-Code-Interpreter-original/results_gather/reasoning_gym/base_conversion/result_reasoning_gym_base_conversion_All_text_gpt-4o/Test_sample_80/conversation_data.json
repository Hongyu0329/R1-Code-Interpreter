    "To convert the base-15 number \"22c\" to base-12, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Base-15 Number:**\n   - The number \"22c\" is in base-15.\n   - In base-15, digits range from 0 to 9 and then from 'a' to 'e' for values 10 to 14.\n   - Here, '2' is 2, and 'c' represents 12 in decimal.\n\n2. **Convert Base-15 to Decimal:**\n   - The number \"22c\" in base-15 can be expanded as:\n     - \\(2 \\times 15^2 + 2 \\times 15^1 + c \\times 15^0\\)\n   - Calculate each term:\n     - \\(2 \\times 15^2 = 2 \\times 225 = 450\\)\n     - \\(2 \\times 15^1 = 2 \\times 15 = 30\\)\n     - \\(c \\times 15^0 = 12 \\times 1 = 12\\)\n   - Add these values to get the decimal equivalent:\n     - \\(450 + 30 + 12 = 492\\)\n\n3. **Convert Decimal to Base-12:**\n   - Now, convert the decimal number 492 to base-12.\n   - Divide 492 by 12 and find the remainder:\n     - \\(492 \\div 12 = 41\\) remainder \\(0\\)\n   - Divide the quotient 41 by 12:\n     - \\(41 \\div 12 = 3\\) remainder \\(5\\)\n   - Divide the quotient 3 by 12:\n     - \\(3 \\div 12 = 0\\) remainder \\(3\\)\n   - The remainders give the base-12 number from least significant to most significant digit.\n\n4. **Compile the Base-12 Number:**\n   - The remainders from the division steps give us the base-12 number:\n     - From least significant to most significant: 0, 5, 3\n   - Therefore, the base-12 number is \"350\".\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   - The base-15 number \"22c\" is equivalent to the base-12 number \"350\".\n\nThe final answer is: <<<350>>>"
