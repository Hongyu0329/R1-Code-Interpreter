    "To convert a number from one base to another, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the process step by step for converting the base-13 number \"a3\" to base-15.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Input\n- The number \"a3\" is in base-13.\n- In base-13, the digits range from 0 to 9 and then from 'a' to 'c', where 'a' represents 10, 'b' represents 11, and 'c' represents 12.\n\n### Step 2: Convert Base-13 to Base-10\nTo convert the number from base-13 to base-10, we need to evaluate it as follows:\n- The number \"a3\" in base-13 can be expanded as:\n  - \\( a \\times 13^1 + 3 \\times 13^0 \\)\n  - Here, 'a' represents 10 in decimal.\n\nCalculate each term:\n- \\( a \\times 13^1 = 10 \\times 13 = 130 \\)\n- \\( 3 \\times 13^0 = 3 \\times 1 = 3 \\)\n\nAdd these values together to get the base-10 equivalent:\n- \\( 130 + 3 = 133 \\)\n\nSo, the base-10 equivalent of \"a3\" in base-13 is 133.\n\n### Step 3: Convert Base-10 to Base-15\nNow, we need to convert the base-10 number 133 to base-15.\n\nTo do this, we perform successive division by 15 and keep track of the remainders:\n1. Divide 133 by 15:\n   - Quotient: \\( 133 \\div 15 = 8 \\) (integer division)\n   - Remainder: \\( 133 \\mod 15 = 13 \\)\n\n2. Divide the quotient (8) by 15:\n   - Quotient: \\( 8 \\div 15 = 0 \\) (since 8 is less than 15)\n   - Remainder: \\( 8 \\mod 15 = 8 \\)\n\nThe remainders give us the digits of the base-15 number, starting from the least significant digit (rightmost):\n- The least significant digit is 13, which corresponds to 'd' in base-15 (since 'a' is 10, 'b' is 11, 'c' is 12, and 'd' is 13).\n- The next digit is 8.\n\nThus, the base-15 representation of the number is \"8d\".\n\n### Final Answer\nThe base-15 equivalent of the base-13 number \"a3\" is:\n\n<<<8d>>>"
