    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to convert the base-9 number 174 to a base-7 number.\n\n2. **Convert the Base-9 Number to Decimal**:\n   - The base-9 number 174 can be expanded as:\n     \\[\n     1 \\times 9^2 + 7 \\times 9^1 + 4 \\times 9^0\n     \\]\n   - Calculate each term:\n     - \\(1 \\times 9^2 = 1 \\times 81 = 81\\)\n     - \\(7 \\times 9^1 = 7 \\times 9 = 63\\)\n     - \\(4 \\times 9^0 = 4 \\times 1 = 4\\)\n   - Sum these values to get the decimal equivalent:\n     \\[\n     81 + 63 + 4 = 148\n     \\]\n   - So, the decimal equivalent of the base-9 number 174 is 148.\n\n3. **Convert the Decimal Number to Base-7**:\n   - We need to convert the decimal number 148 to base-7.\n   - Divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders:\n     - \\(148 \\div 7 = 21\\) remainder \\(1\\)\n     - \\(21 \\div 7 = 3\\) remainder \\(0\\)\n     - \\(3 \\div 7 = 0\\) remainder \\(3\\)\n   - The remainders, read from bottom to top, give the base-7 number.\n   - Therefore, the base-7 representation of the decimal number 148 is 301.\n\n4. **Final Answer**:\n   - The base-9 number 174 is equivalent to the base-7 number 301.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<301>>>"
