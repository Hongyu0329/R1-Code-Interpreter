    "To convert the base-5 number 4334 to base-13, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's break it down:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Base-5 Number\nThe number 4334 in base-5 means:\n- The rightmost digit is the least significant digit (LSD).\n- Each digit represents a power of 5, starting from 5^0 on the right.\n\nSo, 4334 in base-5 can be expanded as:\n- \\(4 \\times 5^3\\)\n- \\(3 \\times 5^2\\)\n- \\(3 \\times 5^1\\)\n- \\(4 \\times 5^0\\)\n\n### Step 2: Convert Base-5 to Base-10\nCalculate the decimal (base-10) equivalent of the base-5 number:\n\n1. \\(4 \\times 5^3 = 4 \\times 125 = 500\\)\n2. \\(3 \\times 5^2 = 3 \\times 25 = 75\\)\n3. \\(3 \\times 5^1 = 3 \\times 5 = 15\\)\n4. \\(4 \\times 5^0 = 4 \\times 1 = 4\\)\n\nAdd these values together to get the base-10 equivalent:\n\\[500 + 75 + 15 + 4 = 594\\]\n\n### Step 3: Convert Base-10 to Base-13\nNow, convert the decimal number 594 to base-13:\n\n1. Divide 594 by 13:\n   - \\(594 \\div 13 = 45\\) remainder \\(9\\)\n   - The remainder (9) is the least significant digit in base-13.\n\n2. Divide the quotient (45) by 13:\n   - \\(45 \\div 13 = 3\\) remainder \\(6\\)\n   - The remainder (6) is the next digit in base-13.\n\n3. Divide the quotient (3) by 13:\n   - \\(3 \\div 13 = 0\\) remainder \\(3\\)\n   - The remainder (3) is the most significant digit in base-13.\n\n### Step 4: Compile the Base-13 Number\nThe base-13 number is read from the most significant digit to the least significant digit, which gives us 369 in base-13.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe base-5 number 4334 is equivalent to the base-13 number 369.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<369>>>"
