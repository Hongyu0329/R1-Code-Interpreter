    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to convert the base-11 number \"78\" to a base-4 number. In base-11, the digits range from 0 to 10, where '10' is represented as 'a'. However, since \"78\" is less than 11, it only uses digits 0-9.\n\n2. **Convert Base-11 to Base-10**: \n   - The number \"78\" in base-11 can be expanded as:\n     \\[\n     7 \\times 11^1 + 8 \\times 11^0\n     \\]\n   - Calculate each term:\n     - \\(7 \\times 11^1 = 7 \\times 11 = 77\\)\n     - \\(8 \\times 11^0 = 8 \\times 1 = 8\\)\n   - Add these values to get the base-10 equivalent:\n     \\[\n     77 + 8 = 85\n     \\]\n   - So, the base-10 equivalent of the base-11 number \"78\" is 85.\n\n3. **Convert Base-10 to Base-4**:\n   - We need to convert the base-10 number 85 to base-4.\n   - Divide the number by 4 and keep track of the remainders:\n     - \\(85 \\div 4 = 21\\) remainder \\(1\\)\n     - \\(21 \\div 4 = 5\\) remainder \\(1\\)\n     - \\(5 \\div 4 = 1\\) remainder \\(1\\)\n     - \\(1 \\div 4 = 0\\) remainder \\(1\\)\n   - The remainders, read from bottom to top, give the base-4 number: 1111.\n\n4. **Final Answer**: The base-4 representation of the base-11 number \"78\" is 1111.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1111>>>"
