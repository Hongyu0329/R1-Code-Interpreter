    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to convert the number 204 from base-11 to base-3.\n\n2. **Convert the Base-11 Number to Decimal**:\n   - The number 204 in base-11 can be expanded as:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 11^2 + 0 \\times 11^1 + 4 \\times 11^0\n     \\]\n   - Calculate each term:\n     - \\(2 \\times 11^2 = 2 \\times 121 = 242\\)\n     - \\(0 \\times 11^1 = 0 \\times 11 = 0\\)\n     - \\(4 \\times 11^0 = 4 \\times 1 = 4\\)\n   - Sum these values to get the decimal equivalent:\n     \\[\n     242 + 0 + 4 = 246\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the decimal equivalent of 204 in base-11 is 246.\n\n3. **Convert the Decimal Number to Base-3**:\n   - We need to convert the decimal number 246 to base-3.\n   - Divide the number by 3 and keep track of the remainders:\n     - \\(246 \\div 3 = 82\\) remainder \\(0\\)\n     - \\(82 \\div 3 = 27\\) remainder \\(1\\)\n     - \\(27 \\div 3 = 9\\) remainder \\(0\\)\n     - \\(9 \\div 3 = 3\\) remainder \\(0\\)\n     - \\(3 \\div 3 = 1\\) remainder \\(0\\)\n     - \\(1 \\div 3 = 0\\) remainder \\(1\\)\n   - The remainders, read from bottom to top, give the base-3 number: 100010.\n\n4. **Final Answer**:\n   - The base-3 representation of the base-11 number 204 is 100010.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<100010>>>"
