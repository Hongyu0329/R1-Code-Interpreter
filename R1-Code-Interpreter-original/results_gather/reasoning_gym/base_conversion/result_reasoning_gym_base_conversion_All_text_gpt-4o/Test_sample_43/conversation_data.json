    "To convert the base-11 number \"38a\" to base-8, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's break it down:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Base-11 Number\n- The number \"38a\" is in base-11.\n- In base-11, digits range from 0 to 10, where 'a' represents 10.\n\n### Step 2: Convert Base-11 to Base-10\nTo convert a number from base-11 to base-10, we multiply each digit by 11 raised to the power of its position (counting from right to left, starting at 0).\n\n- The rightmost digit is 'a', which is 10 in base-10.\n- The middle digit is '8'.\n- The leftmost digit is '3'.\n\nThe base-10 conversion is calculated as follows:\n\\[ \n3 \\times 11^2 + 8 \\times 11^1 + 10 \\times 11^0 \n\\]\n\nCalculate each term:\n- \\(3 \\times 11^2 = 3 \\times 121 = 363\\)\n- \\(8 \\times 11^1 = 8 \\times 11 = 88\\)\n- \\(10 \\times 11^0 = 10 \\times 1 = 10\\)\n\nAdd these values together to get the base-10 equivalent:\n\\[ \n363 + 88 + 10 = 461 \n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Convert Base-10 to Base-8\nNow, we need to convert the base-10 number 461 to base-8.\n\nTo do this, we repeatedly divide the number by 8 and record the remainders.\n\n1. Divide 461 by 8:\n   - Quotient: 57\n   - Remainder: 5\n\n2. Divide 57 by 8:\n   - Quotient: 7\n   - Remainder: 1\n\n3. Divide 7 by 8:\n   - Quotient: 0\n   - Remainder: 7\n\nThe base-8 number is read from the last remainder to the first: 715.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe base-11 number \"38a\" converts to base-8 as:\n\n<<<715>>>"
