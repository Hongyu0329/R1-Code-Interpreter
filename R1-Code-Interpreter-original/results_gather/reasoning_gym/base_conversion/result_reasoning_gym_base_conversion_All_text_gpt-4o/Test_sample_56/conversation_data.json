    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to convert the base-5 number 3112 to a base-7 number.\n\n2. **Convert the Base-5 Number to Decimal**: \n   - The base-5 number 3112 can be expanded as:\n     \\[\n     3 \\times 5^3 + 1 \\times 5^2 + 1 \\times 5^1 + 2 \\times 5^0\n     \\]\n   - Calculate each term:\n     - \\(3 \\times 5^3 = 3 \\times 125 = 375\\)\n     - \\(1 \\times 5^2 = 1 \\times 25 = 25\\)\n     - \\(1 \\times 5^1 = 1 \\times 5 = 5\\)\n     - \\(2 \\times 5^0 = 2 \\times 1 = 2\\)\n   - Sum these values to get the decimal equivalent:\n     \\[\n     375 + 25 + 5 + 2 = 407\n     \\]\n\n3. **Convert the Decimal Number to Base-7**:\n   - We need to convert the decimal number 407 to base-7.\n   - Divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders:\n     - \\(407 \\div 7 = 58\\) with a remainder of \\(1\\)\n     - \\(58 \\div 7 = 8\\) with a remainder of \\(2\\)\n     - \\(8 \\div 7 = 1\\) with a remainder of \\(1\\)\n     - \\(1 \\div 7 = 0\\) with a remainder of \\(1\\)\n   - The base-7 number is obtained by reading the remainders from last to first: \\(1121\\).\n\n4. **Final Answer**: The base-5 number 3112 is equivalent to the base-7 number 1121.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1121>>>"
