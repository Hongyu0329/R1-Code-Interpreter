    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to convert the number 301 from base-11 to base-15.\n\n2. **Convert the Base-11 Number to Decimal**:\n   - The number 301 in base-11 can be expanded as:\n     - \\(3 \\times 11^2 + 0 \\times 11^1 + 1 \\times 11^0\\)\n   - Calculate each term:\n     - \\(3 \\times 11^2 = 3 \\times 121 = 363\\)\n     - \\(0 \\times 11^1 = 0 \\times 11 = 0\\)\n     - \\(1 \\times 11^0 = 1 \\times 1 = 1\\)\n   - Add these values together to get the decimal equivalent:\n     - \\(363 + 0 + 1 = 364\\)\n\n3. **Convert the Decimal Number to Base-15**:\n   - We need to convert the decimal number 364 to base-15.\n   - Divide the number by 15 and keep track of the remainders:\n     - \\(364 \\div 15 = 24\\) with a remainder of \\(4\\)\n     - \\(24 \\div 15 = 1\\) with a remainder of \\(9\\)\n     - \\(1 \\div 15 = 0\\) with a remainder of \\(1\\)\n   - The remainders give us the digits of the base-15 number, read from bottom to top.\n\n4. **Construct the Base-15 Number**:\n   - The remainders from the division steps are 1, 9, and 4.\n   - Therefore, the base-15 representation of the decimal number 364 is 194.\n\n5. **Final Answer**:\n   - The base-15 representation of the base-11 number 301 is 194.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<194>>>"
