    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the original number to base-10 (decimal):**\n   - The original number is 635 in base-8.\n   - To convert it to base-10, we need to expand it using powers of 8.\n   - The number 635 in base-8 can be expressed as:\n     \\[\n     6 \\times 8^2 + 3 \\times 8^1 + 5 \\times 8^0\n     \\]\n   - Calculate each term:\n     - \\(6 \\times 8^2 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\)\n     - \\(3 \\times 8^1 = 3 \\times 8 = 24\\)\n     - \\(5 \\times 8^0 = 5 \\times 1 = 5\\)\n   - Add these values together to get the base-10 equivalent:\n     \\[\n     384 + 24 + 5 = 413\n     \\]\n   - So, 635 in base-8 is 413 in base-10.\n\n2. **Convert the base-10 number to the target base (base-5):**\n   - We need to convert 413 from base-10 to base-5.\n   - To do this, repeatedly divide the number by 5 and record the remainders.\n   - Perform the division:\n     - \\(413 \\div 5 = 82\\) remainder \\(3\\)\n     - \\(82 \\div 5 = 16\\) remainder \\(2\\)\n     - \\(16 \\div 5 = 3\\) remainder \\(1\\)\n     - \\(3 \\div 5 = 0\\) remainder \\(3\\)\n   - The remainders, read from bottom to top, give the base-5 number.\n   - Therefore, 413 in base-10 is 3123 in base-5.\n\n3. **Output the final answer:**\n   - The base-5 representation of the base-8 number 635 is 3123.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<3123>>>"
