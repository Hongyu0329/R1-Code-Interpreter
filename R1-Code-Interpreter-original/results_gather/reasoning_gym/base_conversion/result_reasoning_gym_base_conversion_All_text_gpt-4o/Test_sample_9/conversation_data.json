    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to convert the base-7 number 1065 to base-5.\n\n2. **Convert the Base-7 Number to Base-10**: \n   - The base-7 number 1065 can be expanded as:\n     \\[\n     1 \\times 7^3 + 0 \\times 7^2 + 6 \\times 7^1 + 5 \\times 7^0\n     \\]\n   - Calculate each term:\n     - \\(1 \\times 7^3 = 1 \\times 343 = 343\\)\n     - \\(0 \\times 7^2 = 0 \\times 49 = 0\\)\n     - \\(6 \\times 7^1 = 6 \\times 7 = 42\\)\n     - \\(5 \\times 7^0 = 5 \\times 1 = 5\\)\n   - Sum these values to get the base-10 equivalent:\n     \\[\n     343 + 0 + 42 + 5 = 390\n     \\]\n\n3. **Convert the Base-10 Number to Base-5**:\n   - We need to express 390 in base-5.\n   - Divide 390 by 5 and keep track of the remainders:\n     - \\(390 \\div 5 = 78\\) with a remainder of 0\n     - \\(78 \\div 5 = 15\\) with a remainder of 3\n     - \\(15 \\div 5 = 3\\) with a remainder of 0\n     - \\(3 \\div 5 = 0\\) with a remainder of 3\n   - The remainders, read from bottom to top, give the base-5 number: 3300\n\n4. **Final Answer**: The base-5 equivalent of the base-7 number 1065 is 3300.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3300>>>"
