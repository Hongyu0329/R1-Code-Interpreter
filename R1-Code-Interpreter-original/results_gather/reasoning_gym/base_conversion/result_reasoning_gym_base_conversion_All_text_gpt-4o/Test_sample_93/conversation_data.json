    "To convert the base-5 number 12141 to base-15, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's break it down:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Base-5 Number\nThe number 12141 in base-5 means:\n- The rightmost digit is the least significant digit (LSD).\n- Each digit represents a power of 5, starting from 0 on the right.\n\nSo, 12141 in base-5 can be expanded as:\n- \\(1 \\times 5^4\\)\n- \\(2 \\times 5^3\\)\n- \\(1 \\times 5^2\\)\n- \\(4 \\times 5^1\\)\n- \\(1 \\times 5^0\\)\n\n### Step 2: Convert Base-5 to Base-10\nCalculate the decimal (base-10) equivalent of the base-5 number:\n\n1. \\(1 \\times 5^4 = 1 \\times 625 = 625\\)\n2. \\(2 \\times 5^3 = 2 \\times 125 = 250\\)\n3. \\(1 \\times 5^2 = 1 \\times 25 = 25\\)\n4. \\(4 \\times 5^1 = 4 \\times 5 = 20\\)\n5. \\(1 \\times 5^0 = 1 \\times 1 = 1\\)\n\nAdd these values together to get the base-10 equivalent:\n\\[ 625 + 250 + 25 + 20 + 1 = 921 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Convert Base-10 to Base-15\nNow, convert the decimal number 921 to base-15:\n\n1. Divide 921 by 15:\n   - Quotient: 61\n   - Remainder: 6\n\n2. Divide the quotient (61) by 15:\n   - Quotient: 4\n   - Remainder: 1\n\n3. Divide the quotient (4) by 15:\n   - Quotient: 0\n   - Remainder: 4\n\nThe remainders, read from bottom to top, give the base-15 number.\n\n### Step 4: Construct the Base-15 Number\nThe base-15 number is constructed from the remainders:\n- The remainders are 4, 1, and 6.\n- Therefore, the base-15 number is 416.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe base-5 number 12141 is equivalent to the base-15 number 416.\n\nOutput the final answer in the specified format:\n<<<416>>>"
