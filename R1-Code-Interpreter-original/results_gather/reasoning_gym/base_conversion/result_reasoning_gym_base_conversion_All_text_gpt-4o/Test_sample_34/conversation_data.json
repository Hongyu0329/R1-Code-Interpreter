    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to convert the base-6 number \"200\" to a base-8 number.\n\n2. **Convert the Base-6 Number to Decimal**:\n   - The base-6 number \"200\" can be expanded as:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 6^2 + 0 \\times 6^1 + 0 \\times 6^0\n     \\]\n   - Calculate each term:\n     - \\(2 \\times 6^2 = 2 \\times 36 = 72\\)\n     - \\(0 \\times 6^1 = 0\\)\n     - \\(0 \\times 6^0 = 0\\)\n   - Add these values together to get the decimal equivalent:\n     \\[\n     72 + 0 + 0 = 72\n     \\]\n   - So, the base-6 number \"200\" is equal to 72 in decimal.\n\n3. **Convert the Decimal Number to Base-8**:\n   - We need to convert the decimal number 72 to base-8.\n   - Divide the decimal number by 8 and keep track of the remainders:\n     - \\(72 \\div 8 = 9\\) with a remainder of 0\n     - \\(9 \\div 8 = 1\\) with a remainder of 1\n     - \\(1 \\div 8 = 0\\) with a remainder of 1\n   - The base-8 number is formed by the remainders read from bottom to top: 110.\n\n4. **Final Answer**:\n   - The base-6 number \"200\" is equivalent to the base-8 number \"110\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<110>>>"
