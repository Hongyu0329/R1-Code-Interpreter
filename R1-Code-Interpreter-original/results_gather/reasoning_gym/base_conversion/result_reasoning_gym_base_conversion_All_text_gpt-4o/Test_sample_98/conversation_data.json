    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to convert the base-8 number 1024 to a base-6 number.\n\n2. **Convert the Base-8 Number to Decimal**: \n   - The base-8 number 1024 can be expanded as:\n     \\[\n     1 \\times 8^3 + 0 \\times 8^2 + 2 \\times 8^1 + 4 \\times 8^0\n     \\]\n   - Calculate each term:\n     - \\(1 \\times 8^3 = 1 \\times 512 = 512\\)\n     - \\(0 \\times 8^2 = 0 \\times 64 = 0\\)\n     - \\(2 \\times 8^1 = 2 \\times 8 = 16\\)\n     - \\(4 \\times 8^0 = 4 \\times 1 = 4\\)\n   - Sum these values to get the decimal equivalent:\n     \\[\n     512 + 0 + 16 + 4 = 532\n     \\]\n\n3. **Convert the Decimal Number to Base-6**:\n   - We need to express 532 in base-6.\n   - Divide 532 by 6 and keep track of the remainders:\n     - \\(532 \\div 6 = 88\\) remainder \\(4\\)\n     - \\(88 \\div 6 = 14\\) remainder \\(4\\)\n     - \\(14 \\div 6 = 2\\) remainder \\(2\\)\n     - \\(2 \\div 6 = 0\\) remainder \\(2\\)\n   - The base-6 number is read from the last remainder to the first: \\(2244_6\\).\n\n4. **Final Answer**: The base-6 representation of the base-8 number 1024 is 2244.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2244>>>"
