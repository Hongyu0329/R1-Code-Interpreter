    "To convert a base-10 number to another base, we need to repeatedly divide the number by the new base and keep track of the remainders. These remainders represent the digits of the number in the new base, starting from the least significant digit (rightmost) to the most significant digit (leftmost).\n\nLet's convert the base-10 number 331 to base-11 step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Number**: Start with the base-10 number 331.\n\n2. **Divide by Base-11**: Divide 331 by 11 and find the quotient and remainder.\n   - 331 รท 11 = 30 with a remainder of 1.\n   - The remainder (1) is the least significant digit in base-11.\n\n3. **Next Division**: Take the quotient from the previous step (30) and divide it by 11.\n   - 30 รท 11 = 2 with a remainder of 8.\n   - The remainder (8) is the next digit in base-11.\n\n4. **Final Division**: Take the quotient from the previous step (2) and divide it by 11.\n   - 2 รท 11 = 0 with a remainder of 2.\n   - The remainder (2) is the most significant digit in base-11.\n\n5. **Construct the Base-11 Number**: Write the remainders from the last to the first to form the base-11 number.\n   - The digits from most significant to least significant are 2, 8, and 1.\n\nTherefore, the base-10 number 331 is represented as 281 in base-11.\n\nFinal answer: <<<281>>>"
