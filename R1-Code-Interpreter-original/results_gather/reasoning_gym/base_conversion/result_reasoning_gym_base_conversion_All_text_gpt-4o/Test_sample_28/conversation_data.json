    "To convert the base-6 number 1243 to base-11, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's break it down:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Base-6 Number\nThe number 1243 in base-6 means:\n- The rightmost digit is the least significant digit (LSD).\n- Each digit represents a power of 6, starting from 0 on the right.\n\nSo, 1243 in base-6 can be expanded as:\n- \\(1 \\times 6^3\\)\n- \\(2 \\times 6^2\\)\n- \\(4 \\times 6^1\\)\n- \\(3 \\times 6^0\\)\n\n### Step 2: Convert Base-6 to Base-10\nCalculate the decimal (base-10) equivalent of the base-6 number:\n\n1. \\(1 \\times 6^3 = 1 \\times 216 = 216\\)\n2. \\(2 \\times 6^2 = 2 \\times 36 = 72\\)\n3. \\(4 \\times 6^1 = 4 \\times 6 = 24\\)\n4. \\(3 \\times 6^0 = 3 \\times 1 = 3\\)\n\nAdd these values together to get the base-10 equivalent:\n\\[ 216 + 72 + 24 + 3 = 315 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Convert Base-10 to Base-11\nNow, convert the base-10 number 315 to base-11:\n\n1. Divide 315 by 11:\n   - \\(315 \\div 11 = 28\\) remainder \\(7\\)\n   - The remainder (7) is the least significant digit (LSD) in base-11.\n\n2. Divide the quotient (28) by 11:\n   - \\(28 \\div 11 = 2\\) remainder \\(6\\)\n   - The remainder (6) is the next digit in base-11.\n\n3. Divide the quotient (2) by 11:\n   - \\(2 \\div 11 = 0\\) remainder \\(2\\)\n   - The remainder (2) is the most significant digit (MSD) in base-11.\n\n### Step 4: Compile the Base-11 Number\nThe base-11 number is compiled from the remainders, starting from the last division:\n- MSD to LSD: 267\n\n### Final Answer\nThe base-6 number 1243 is equivalent to the base-11 number 267.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<267>>>"
