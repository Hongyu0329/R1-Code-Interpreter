    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input and Output Bases:**\n   - The input number is in base-15.\n   - The target base is base-14.\n\n2. **Convert the Base-15 Number to Decimal:**\n   - The number given is \"2a0\" in base-15.\n   - In base-15, the digits are 0-9 and a-e, where 'a' represents 10.\n   - The number \"2a0\" can be expanded as:\n     - \\(2 \\times 15^2 + a \\times 15^1 + 0 \\times 15^0\\)\n     - Substitute 'a' with 10:\n     - \\(2 \\times 15^2 + 10 \\times 15^1 + 0 \\times 15^0\\)\n   - Calculate each term:\n     - \\(2 \\times 15^2 = 2 \\times 225 = 450\\)\n     - \\(10 \\times 15^1 = 10 \\times 15 = 150\\)\n     - \\(0 \\times 15^0 = 0\\)\n   - Sum these values to get the decimal equivalent:\n     - \\(450 + 150 + 0 = 600\\)\n\n3. **Convert the Decimal Number to Base-14:**\n   - Now, convert the decimal number 600 to base-14.\n   - Divide the number by 14 and keep track of the remainders:\n     - \\(600 \\div 14 = 42\\) remainder \\(12\\)\n     - \\(42 \\div 14 = 3\\) remainder \\(0\\)\n     - \\(3 \\div 14 = 0\\) remainder \\(3\\)\n   - The remainders give the digits of the base-14 number, read from bottom to top.\n   - The base-14 number is \"30c\", where 'c' represents 12.\n\n4. **Final Answer:**\n   - The base-15 number \"2a0\" converts to \"30c\" in base-14.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<30c>>>"
