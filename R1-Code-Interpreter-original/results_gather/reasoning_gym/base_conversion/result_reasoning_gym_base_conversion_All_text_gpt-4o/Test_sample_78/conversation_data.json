    "To convert the base-8 number 1674 to base-14, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Base-8 Number System**: \n   - Base-8 (octal) uses digits from 0 to 7.\n   - The number 1674 in base-8 can be expanded as:\n     \\[\n     1 \\times 8^3 + 6 \\times 8^2 + 7 \\times 8^1 + 4 \\times 8^0\n     \\]\n\n2. **Convert Base-8 to Base-10**:\n   - Calculate each term:\n     - \\(1 \\times 8^3 = 1 \\times 512 = 512\\)\n     - \\(6 \\times 8^2 = 6 \\times 64 = 384\\)\n     - \\(7 \\times 8^1 = 7 \\times 8 = 56\\)\n     - \\(4 \\times 8^0 = 4 \\times 1 = 4\\)\n   - Sum these values to get the base-10 equivalent:\n     \\[\n     512 + 384 + 56 + 4 = 956\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the base-10 equivalent of 1674 (base-8) is 956.\n\n3. **Convert Base-10 to Base-14**:\n   - Base-14 uses digits 0-9 and letters a, b, c, d, e, f for values 10-13.\n   - Divide the base-10 number by 14 and keep track of the remainders:\n     - \\(956 \\div 14 = 68\\) remainder \\(4\\)\n     - \\(68 \\div 14 = 4\\) remainder \\(12\\) (which is 'c' in base-14)\n     - \\(4 \\div 14 = 0\\) remainder \\(4\\)\n   - The remainders give the digits of the base-14 number, read from bottom to top.\n\n4. **Compile the Base-14 Number**:\n   - The remainders from the division steps are 4, 12 ('c'), and 4.\n   - Therefore, the base-14 representation of the number is 4c4.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<4c4>>>"
