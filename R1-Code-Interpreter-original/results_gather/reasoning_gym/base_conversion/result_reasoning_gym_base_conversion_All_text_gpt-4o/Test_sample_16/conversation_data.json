    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to convert the base-7 number 1431 to base-4.\n\n2. **Convert the Base-7 Number to Base-10**: \n   - The base-7 number 1431 can be expanded as:\n     \\[\n     1 \\times 7^3 + 4 \\times 7^2 + 3 \\times 7^1 + 1 \\times 7^0\n     \\]\n   - Calculate each term:\n     - \\(1 \\times 7^3 = 1 \\times 343 = 343\\)\n     - \\(4 \\times 7^2 = 4 \\times 49 = 196\\)\n     - \\(3 \\times 7^1 = 3 \\times 7 = 21\\)\n     - \\(1 \\times 7^0 = 1 \\times 1 = 1\\)\n   - Sum these values to get the base-10 equivalent:\n     \\[\n     343 + 196 + 21 + 1 = 561\n     \\]\n\n3. **Convert the Base-10 Number to Base-4**:\n   - We need to convert 561 from base-10 to base-4.\n   - Divide the number by 4 and keep track of the remainders:\n     - \\(561 \\div 4 = 140\\) remainder \\(1\\)\n     - \\(140 \\div 4 = 35\\) remainder \\(0\\)\n     - \\(35 \\div 4 = 8\\) remainder \\(3\\)\n     - \\(8 \\div 4 = 2\\) remainder \\(0\\)\n     - \\(2 \\div 4 = 0\\) remainder \\(2\\)\n   - The remainders, read from bottom to top, give the base-4 number: 20301.\n\n4. **Final Answer**: The base-4 equivalent of the base-7 number 1431 is 20301.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<20301>>>"
