    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to convert the number 107 from base-12 to base-11.\n\n2. **Convert the Base-12 Number to Decimal**:\n   - The number 107 in base-12 can be expanded as:\n     \\[\n     1 \\times 12^2 + 0 \\times 12^1 + 7 \\times 12^0\n     \\]\n   - Calculate each term:\n     - \\(1 \\times 12^2 = 1 \\times 144 = 144\\)\n     - \\(0 \\times 12^1 = 0 \\times 12 = 0\\)\n     - \\(7 \\times 12^0 = 7 \\times 1 = 7\\)\n   - Add these values together to get the decimal equivalent:\n     \\[\n     144 + 0 + 7 = 151\n     \\]\n   - So, the base-12 number 107 is equal to 151 in decimal.\n\n3. **Convert the Decimal Number to Base-11**:\n   - We need to convert the decimal number 151 to base-11.\n   - Divide the number by 11 and keep track of the remainders:\n     - \\(151 \\div 11 = 13\\) with a remainder of 8\n     - \\(13 \\div 11 = 1\\) with a remainder of 2\n     - \\(1 \\div 11 = 0\\) with a remainder of 1\n   - The remainders, read from last to first, give the base-11 number.\n   - Therefore, the base-11 representation is 128.\n\n4. **Final Answer**:\n   - The base-12 number 107 is equivalent to the base-11 number 128.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<128>>>"
