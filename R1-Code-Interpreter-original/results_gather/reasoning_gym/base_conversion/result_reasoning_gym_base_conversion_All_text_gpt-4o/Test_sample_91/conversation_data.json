    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to convert the base-6 number 125 to base-3.\n\n2. **Convert the Base-6 Number to Decimal**:\n   - The base-6 number 125 can be expanded as:\n     - \\(1 \\times 6^2 + 2 \\times 6^1 + 5 \\times 6^0\\)\n   - Calculate each term:\n     - \\(1 \\times 6^2 = 1 \\times 36 = 36\\)\n     - \\(2 \\times 6^1 = 2 \\times 6 = 12\\)\n     - \\(5 \\times 6^0 = 5 \\times 1 = 5\\)\n   - Add these values together to get the decimal equivalent:\n     - \\(36 + 12 + 5 = 53\\)\n\n3. **Convert the Decimal Number to Base-3**:\n   - We need to convert the decimal number 53 to base-3.\n   - Divide the number by 3 and keep track of the remainders:\n     - \\(53 \\div 3 = 17\\) with a remainder of 2\n     - \\(17 \\div 3 = 5\\) with a remainder of 2\n     - \\(5 \\div 3 = 1\\) with a remainder of 2\n     - \\(1 \\div 3 = 0\\) with a remainder of 1\n   - The base-3 number is read from the last remainder to the first: 1222\n\n4. **Final Answer**:\n   - The base-6 number 125 is equivalent to the base-3 number 1222.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1222>>>"
