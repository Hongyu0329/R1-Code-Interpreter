    "To convert the binary number 1010111100 to base-3, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the Input and Output Bases:**\n   - The input number is in binary (base-2).\n   - The target base is base-3.\n\n2. **Convert the Binary Number to Decimal:**\n   - The binary number 1010111100 can be converted to decimal by evaluating the sum of powers of 2 for each bit that is set (1).\n   - Starting from the right (least significant bit), the powers of 2 are: \\(2^0, 2^1, 2^2, \\ldots, 2^9\\).\n   - Calculate the decimal value:\n     \\[\n     1 \\times 2^9 + 0 \\times 2^8 + 1 \\times 2^7 + 0 \\times 2^6 + 1 \\times 2^5 + 1 \\times 2^4 + 1 \\times 2^3 + 1 \\times 2^2 + 0 \\times 2^1 + 0 \\times 2^0\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     = 1 \\times 512 + 0 \\times 256 + 1 \\times 128 + 0 \\times 64 + 1 \\times 32 + 1 \\times 16 + 1 \\times 8 + 1 \\times 4 + 0 \\times 2 + 0 \\times 1\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     = 512 + 0 + 128 + 0 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 0 + 0 = 700\n     \\]\n   - The decimal equivalent of the binary number 1010111100 is 700.\n\n3. **Convert the Decimal Number to Base-3:**\n   - To convert from decimal to base-3, repeatedly divide the number by 3 and record the remainders.\n   - Perform the division:\n     - \\(700 \\div 3 = 233\\) remainder \\(1\\)\n     - \\(233 \\div 3 = 77\\) remainder \\(2\\)\n     - \\(77 \\div 3 = 25\\) remainder \\(2\\)\n     - \\(25 \\div 3 = 8\\) remainder \\(1\\)\n     - \\(8 \\div 3 = 2\\) remainder \\(2\\)\n     - \\(2 \\div 3 = 0\\) remainder \\(2\\)\n   - The remainders, read from bottom to top, give the base-3 number.\n\n4. **Compile the Base-3 Number:**\n   - The base-3 number is \\(221221\\).\n\n5. **Output the Final Answer:**\n   - The base-3 representation of the binary number 1010111100 is \\(221221\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<221221>>>"
