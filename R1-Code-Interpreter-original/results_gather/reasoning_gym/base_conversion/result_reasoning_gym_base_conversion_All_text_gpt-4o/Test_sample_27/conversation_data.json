    "To convert the base-3 number 22111 to hexadecimal, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's break it down:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\n- We have a number in base-3: 22111.\n- We need to convert this number to base-16 (hexadecimal).\n\n### Step 2: Convert Base-3 to Base-10\nTo convert a number from base-3 to base-10, we multiply each digit by 3 raised to the power of its position (counting from right to left, starting at 0).\n\nFor the number 22111 in base-3:\n- The rightmost digit is 1, and its position is 0.\n- The next digit is 1, and its position is 1.\n- The next digit is 1, and its position is 2.\n- The next digit is 2, and its position is 3.\n- The leftmost digit is 2, and its position is 4.\n\nCalculate the base-10 value:\n\\[ \n2 \\times 3^4 + 2 \\times 3^3 + 1 \\times 3^2 + 1 \\times 3^1 + 1 \\times 3^0 \n\\]\n\nBreaking it down:\n- \\(2 \\times 3^4 = 2 \\times 81 = 162\\)\n- \\(2 \\times 3^3 = 2 \\times 27 = 54\\)\n- \\(1 \\times 3^2 = 1 \\times 9 = 9\\)\n- \\(1 \\times 3^1 = 1 \\times 3 = 3\\)\n- \\(1 \\times 3^0 = 1 \\times 1 = 1\\)\n\nAdd these values together:\n\\[ \n162 + 54 + 9 + 3 + 1 = 229 \n\\]\n\nSo, the base-10 equivalent of 22111 in base-3 is 229.\n\n### Step 3: Convert Base-10 to Base-16\nNow, we need to convert the base-10 number 229 to base-16.\n\nTo do this, we divide the number by 16 and keep track of the remainders:\n- \\(229 \\div 16 = 14\\) remainder \\(5\\)\n\nThe quotient is 14, and the remainder is 5. In hexadecimal, 14 is represented by the letter 'e'.\n\nThus, the base-16 representation of 229 is 'e5'.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe base-3 number 22111 is equivalent to the hexadecimal number e5.\n\nOutput the final answer in the specified format:\n<<<e5>>>"
