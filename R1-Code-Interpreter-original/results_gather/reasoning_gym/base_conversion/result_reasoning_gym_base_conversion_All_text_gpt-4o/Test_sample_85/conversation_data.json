    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to convert the base-4 number 3311 to a base-5 number.\n\n2. **Convert the Base-4 Number to Decimal**:\n   - The base-4 number 3311 can be expanded as:\n     - \\(3 \\times 4^3 + 3 \\times 4^2 + 1 \\times 4^1 + 1 \\times 4^0\\)\n   - Calculate each term:\n     - \\(3 \\times 4^3 = 3 \\times 64 = 192\\)\n     - \\(3 \\times 4^2 = 3 \\times 16 = 48\\)\n     - \\(1 \\times 4^1 = 1 \\times 4 = 4\\)\n     - \\(1 \\times 4^0 = 1 \\times 1 = 1\\)\n   - Sum these values to get the decimal equivalent:\n     - \\(192 + 48 + 4 + 1 = 245\\)\n\n3. **Convert the Decimal Number to Base-5**:\n   - We need to convert the decimal number 245 to base-5.\n   - Divide the number by 5 and keep track of the remainders:\n     - \\(245 \\div 5 = 49\\) with a remainder of 0\n     - \\(49 \\div 5 = 9\\) with a remainder of 4\n     - \\(9 \\div 5 = 1\\) with a remainder of 4\n     - \\(1 \\div 5 = 0\\) with a remainder of 1\n   - The base-5 number is obtained by reading the remainders from last to first: 1440\n\n4. **Final Answer**:\n   - The base-4 number 3311 is equivalent to the base-5 number 1440.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1440>>>"
