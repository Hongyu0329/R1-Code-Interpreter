    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to convert the number 129 from base-13 to base-11.\n\n2. **Convert the Base-13 Number to Decimal**:\n   - The number 129 in base-13 can be expanded as:\n     \\[\n     1 \\times 13^2 + 2 \\times 13^1 + 9 \\times 13^0\n     \\]\n   - Calculate each term:\n     - \\(1 \\times 13^2 = 1 \\times 169 = 169\\)\n     - \\(2 \\times 13^1 = 2 \\times 13 = 26\\)\n     - \\(9 \\times 13^0 = 9 \\times 1 = 9\\)\n   - Sum these values to get the decimal equivalent:\n     \\[\n     169 + 26 + 9 = 204\n     \\]\n   - So, the decimal equivalent of 129 in base-13 is 204.\n\n3. **Convert the Decimal Number to Base-11**:\n   - We need to convert the decimal number 204 to base-11.\n   - Divide the number by 11 and keep track of the remainders:\n     - \\(204 \\div 11 = 18\\) with a remainder of \\(6\\)\n     - \\(18 \\div 11 = 1\\) with a remainder of \\(7\\)\n     - \\(1 \\div 11 = 0\\) with a remainder of \\(1\\)\n   - The remainders give us the digits of the base-11 number, starting from the last remainder to the first:\n     - The base-11 number is \\(176\\).\n\n4. **Final Answer**:\n   - The base-11 equivalent of the base-13 number 129 is 176.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<176>>>"
