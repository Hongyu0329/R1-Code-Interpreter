    "To convert the binary number 100010010 to hexadecimal, we need to follow a step-by-step process. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the Bases**:\n   - Binary is base 2, which uses digits 0 and 1.\n   - Hexadecimal is base 16, which uses digits 0-9 and letters a-f (or A-F) for values 10-15.\n\n2. **Group the Binary Digits**:\n   - Hexadecimal digits represent 4 binary digits (bits) because \\(2^4 = 16\\).\n   - Start grouping the binary number from the right (least significant bit) to the left, in groups of 4.\n   - If the number of binary digits is not a multiple of 4, pad the leftmost group with zeros.\n\n3. **Binary Number**: 100010010\n   - Group from right: 1000 1001 0\n   - Pad the leftmost group with zeros to make it 4 bits: 0100 0010 0100\n\n4. **Convert Each Group to Hexadecimal**:\n   - 0100 in binary is 4 in decimal, which is 4 in hexadecimal.\n   - 0010 in binary is 2 in decimal, which is 2 in hexadecimal.\n   - 0100 in binary is 4 in decimal, which is 4 in hexadecimal.\n\n5. **Combine the Hexadecimal Digits**:\n   - Combine the hexadecimal digits from left to right: 124\n\n6. **Final Answer**:\n   - The binary number 100010010 converts to 124 in hexadecimal.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<124>>>"
