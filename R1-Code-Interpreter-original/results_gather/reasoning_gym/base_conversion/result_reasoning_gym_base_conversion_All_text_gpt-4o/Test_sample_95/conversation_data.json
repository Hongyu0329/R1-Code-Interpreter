    "To convert the hexadecimal number \"2d\" to base-11, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's break it down:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Input\n- The input number is \"2d\" in hexadecimal (base-16).\n- Hexadecimal uses digits 0-9 and letters a-f, where:\n  - 'a' = 10\n  - 'b' = 11\n  - 'c' = 12\n  - 'd' = 13\n  - 'e' = 14\n  - 'f' = 15\n\n### Step 2: Convert Hexadecimal to Decimal\n- The hexadecimal number \"2d\" can be broken down as:\n  - '2' in the 16^1 place\n  - 'd' in the 16^0 place\n\n- Calculate the decimal value:\n  - '2' in the 16^1 place: 2 * 16^1 = 2 * 16 = 32\n  - 'd' in the 16^0 place: 13 * 16^0 = 13 * 1 = 13\n\n- Add these values together to get the decimal equivalent:\n  - 32 + 13 = 45\n\n### Step 3: Convert Decimal to Base-11\n- Now, we need to convert the decimal number 45 to base-11.\n\n- Divide the decimal number by 11 and find the quotient and remainder:\n  - 45 รท 11 = 4 with a remainder of 1\n\n- The quotient is 4, and the remainder is 1. Since the quotient is less than 11, we stop here.\n\n- The base-11 number is formed by the remainders, read from top to bottom (from the last remainder to the first).\n\n### Step 4: Construct the Base-11 Number\n- The base-11 number is \"41\".\n\n### Final Answer\n- The hexadecimal number \"2d\" converts to \"41\" in base-11.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<41>>>"
