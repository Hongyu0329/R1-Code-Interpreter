    "To convert the base-6 number 103 to base-13, we need to follow a series of steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Base-6 Number:**\n   - The number 103 in base-6 means:\n     - The rightmost digit is the 6^0 place.\n     - The middle digit is the 6^1 place.\n     - The leftmost digit is the 6^2 place.\n\n2. **Convert Base-6 to Base-10:**\n   - Calculate the decimal (base-10) equivalent of the base-6 number 103.\n   - The base-6 number 103 can be expanded as:\n     - \\(1 \\times 6^2 + 0 \\times 6^1 + 3 \\times 6^0\\)\n   - Calculate each term:\n     - \\(1 \\times 6^2 = 1 \\times 36 = 36\\)\n     - \\(0 \\times 6^1 = 0 \\times 6 = 0\\)\n     - \\(3 \\times 6^0 = 3 \\times 1 = 3\\)\n   - Sum these values to get the base-10 equivalent:\n     - \\(36 + 0 + 3 = 39\\)\n\n3. **Convert Base-10 to Base-13:**\n   - Now, convert the decimal number 39 to base-13.\n   - Divide the number by 13 and keep track of the quotient and remainder.\n   - First division:\n     - \\(39 \\div 13 = 3\\) with a remainder of \\(0\\).\n   - The quotient is 3, and the remainder is 0.\n   - Since the quotient (3) is less than 13, it becomes the most significant digit.\n   - The base-13 number is formed by the digits: 30.\n\n4. **Final Result:**\n   - The base-6 number 103 is equivalent to the base-13 number 30.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<30>>>"
