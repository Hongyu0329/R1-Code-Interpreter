    "To convert the base-8 number 1216 to base-14, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's break it down:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Base-8 Number\nThe number 1216 in base-8 means:\n- The rightmost digit is the least significant digit.\n- Each digit represents a power of 8, starting from 0 on the right.\n\nSo, 1216 in base-8 can be expanded as:\n\\[ 1 \\times 8^3 + 2 \\times 8^2 + 1 \\times 8^1 + 6 \\times 8^0 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Convert Base-8 to Base-10\nCalculate the decimal (base-10) equivalent of the base-8 number:\n- \\( 1 \\times 8^3 = 1 \\times 512 = 512 \\)\n- \\( 2 \\times 8^2 = 2 \\times 64 = 128 \\)\n- \\( 1 \\times 8^1 = 1 \\times 8 = 8 \\)\n- \\( 6 \\times 8^0 = 6 \\times 1 = 6 \\)\n\nAdd these values together to get the base-10 equivalent:\n\\[ 512 + 128 + 8 + 6 = 654 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Convert Base-10 to Base-14\nNow, we need to convert the decimal number 654 to base-14. We do this by dividing the number by 14 and keeping track of the remainders.\n\n1. Divide 654 by 14:\n   - Quotient: 46\n   - Remainder: 10\n\n2. Divide the quotient (46) by 14:\n   - Quotient: 3\n   - Remainder: 4\n\n3. Divide the quotient (3) by 14:\n   - Quotient: 0\n   - Remainder: 3\n\nThe remainders, read from bottom to top, give us the base-14 number. Note that in base-14, the digit 10 is represented by 'a'.\n\n### Step 4: Write the Base-14 Number\nThe base-14 number is constructed from the remainders:\n- The least significant digit (rightmost) is the first remainder (10, which is 'a').\n- The next digit is 4.\n- The most significant digit (leftmost) is 3.\n\nThus, the base-14 representation of the number is 34a.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe base-8 number 1216 converted to base-14 is:\n\n<<<34a>>>"
