    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to convert the number 555 from base-9 to base-6.\n\n2. **Convert the Base-9 Number to Decimal**:\n   - The number 555 in base-9 can be expanded as:\n     \\[\n     5 \\times 9^2 + 5 \\times 9^1 + 5 \\times 9^0\n     \\]\n   - Calculate each term:\n     - \\(5 \\times 9^2 = 5 \\times 81 = 405\\)\n     - \\(5 \\times 9^1 = 5 \\times 9 = 45\\)\n     - \\(5 \\times 9^0 = 5 \\times 1 = 5\\)\n   - Sum these values to get the decimal equivalent:\n     \\[\n     405 + 45 + 5 = 455\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, 555 in base-9 is 455 in decimal.\n\n3. **Convert the Decimal Number to Base-6**:\n   - We need to convert 455 from decimal to base-6.\n   - Divide the number by 6 and keep track of the remainders:\n     - \\(455 \\div 6 = 75\\) remainder \\(5\\)\n     - \\(75 \\div 6 = 12\\) remainder \\(3\\)\n     - \\(12 \\div 6 = 2\\) remainder \\(0\\)\n     - \\(2 \\div 6 = 0\\) remainder \\(2\\)\n   - The remainders, read from bottom to top, give the base-6 number.\n\n4. **Compile the Base-6 Number**:\n   - The remainders from the division process are 2, 0, 3, and 5.\n   - Therefore, the base-6 representation of the decimal number 455 is 2035.\n\n5. **Final Answer**:\n   - The base-9 number 555 is equivalent to the base-6 number 2035.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<2035>>>"
