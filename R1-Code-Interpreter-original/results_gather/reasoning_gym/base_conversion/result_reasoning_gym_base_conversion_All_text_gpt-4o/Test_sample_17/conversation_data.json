    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to convert the base-7 number \"125\" to a base-8 number.\n\n2. **Convert the Base-7 Number to Base-10**:\n   - The base-7 number \"125\" can be expanded as:\n     - \\(1 \\times 7^2 + 2 \\times 7^1 + 5 \\times 7^0\\)\n   - Calculate each term:\n     - \\(1 \\times 7^2 = 1 \\times 49 = 49\\)\n     - \\(2 \\times 7^1 = 2 \\times 7 = 14\\)\n     - \\(5 \\times 7^0 = 5 \\times 1 = 5\\)\n   - Add these values together to get the base-10 equivalent:\n     - \\(49 + 14 + 5 = 68\\)\n\n3. **Convert the Base-10 Number to Base-8**:\n   - We now have the base-10 number 68, which we need to convert to base-8.\n   - Divide the number by 8 and keep track of the remainders:\n     - \\(68 \\div 8 = 8\\) with a remainder of 4\n     - \\(8 \\div 8 = 1\\) with a remainder of 0\n     - \\(1 \\div 8 = 0\\) with a remainder of 1\n   - The base-8 number is formed by the remainders read from bottom to top: 104\n\n4. **Final Answer**:\n   - The base-7 number \"125\" is equivalent to the base-8 number \"104\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<104>>>"
