    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to convert the number 248 from base-15 to base-9.\n\n2. **Convert the Base-15 Number to Base-10**:\n   - The number 248 in base-15 can be expanded as:\n     \\[\n     2 \\times 15^2 + 4 \\times 15^1 + 8 \\times 15^0\n     \\]\n   - Calculate each term:\n     - \\(2 \\times 15^2 = 2 \\times 225 = 450\\)\n     - \\(4 \\times 15^1 = 4 \\times 15 = 60\\)\n     - \\(8 \\times 15^0 = 8 \\times 1 = 8\\)\n   - Sum these values to get the base-10 equivalent:\n     \\[\n     450 + 60 + 8 = 518\n     \\]\n   - So, 248 in base-15 is 518 in base-10.\n\n3. **Convert the Base-10 Number to Base-9**:\n   - We need to convert 518 from base-10 to base-9.\n   - Divide 518 by 9 and keep track of the remainders:\n     - \\(518 \\div 9 = 57\\) remainder \\(5\\)\n     - \\(57 \\div 9 = 6\\) remainder \\(3\\)\n     - \\(6 \\div 9 = 0\\) remainder \\(6\\)\n   - The remainders give us the digits of the base-9 number, read from bottom to top.\n\n4. **Compile the Base-9 Number**:\n   - Reading the remainders from last to first, we get the base-9 number: 635.\n\nTherefore, the base-15 number 248 is equivalent to the base-9 number 635.\n\nFinal answer: <<<635>>>"
