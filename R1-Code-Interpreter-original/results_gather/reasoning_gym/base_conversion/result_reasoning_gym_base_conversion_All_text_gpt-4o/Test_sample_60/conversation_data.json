    "To convert a number from base-10 to another base, we need to repeatedly divide the number by the target base and keep track of the remainders. These remainders represent the digits of the number in the new base, starting from the least significant digit (rightmost) to the most significant digit (leftmost).\n\nLet's convert the base-10 number 431 to base-11 step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Number**: 431\n2. **Target Base**: 11\n\n**Step-by-Step Conversion**:\n\n1. **Divide 431 by 11**:\n   - Quotient: 431 รท 11 = 39\n   - Remainder: 431 % 11 = 2\n   - The remainder (2) is the least significant digit in base-11.\n\n2. **Divide the Quotient (39) by 11**:\n   - Quotient: 39 รท 11 = 3\n   - Remainder: 39 % 11 = 6\n   - The remainder (6) is the next digit in base-11.\n\n3. **Divide the Quotient (3) by 11**:\n   - Quotient: 3 รท 11 = 0\n   - Remainder: 3 % 11 = 3\n   - The remainder (3) is the most significant digit in base-11.\n\nSince the quotient is now 0, we stop the division process.\n\n**Assembling the Digits**:\n- The digits obtained from the remainders, from most significant to least significant, are 3, 6, and 2.\n\nTherefore, the base-11 representation of the base-10 number 431 is 362.\n\nFinal answer: <<<362>>>"
