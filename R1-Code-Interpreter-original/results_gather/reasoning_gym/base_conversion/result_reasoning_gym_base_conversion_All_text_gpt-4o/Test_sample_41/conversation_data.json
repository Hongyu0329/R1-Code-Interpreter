    "To convert a number from base-3 to base-10, we need to understand the positional value of each digit in the base-3 number. Each digit in a base-3 number represents a power of 3, starting from the rightmost digit which is 3^0, then 3^1, 3^2, and so on, moving left.\n\nLet's break down the conversion of the base-3 number 101121 to base-10 step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the digits and their positions**: \n   - The base-3 number is 101121.\n   - From right to left, the digits are: 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1.\n\n2. **Assign powers of 3 to each position**:\n   - The rightmost digit (1) is at position 0, so it is multiplied by 3^0.\n   - The next digit (2) is at position 1, so it is multiplied by 3^1.\n   - The next digit (1) is at position 2, so it is multiplied by 3^2.\n   - The next digit (1) is at position 3, so it is multiplied by 3^3.\n   - The next digit (0) is at position 4, so it is multiplied by 3^4.\n   - The leftmost digit (1) is at position 5, so it is multiplied by 3^5.\n\n3. **Calculate the value of each digit**:\n   - 1 * 3^0 = 1 * 1 = 1\n   - 2 * 3^1 = 2 * 3 = 6\n   - 1 * 3^2 = 1 * 9 = 9\n   - 1 * 3^3 = 1 * 27 = 27\n   - 0 * 3^4 = 0 * 81 = 0\n   - 1 * 3^5 = 1 * 243 = 243\n\n4. **Sum the values**:\n   - Add all the calculated values together: 1 + 6 + 9 + 27 + 0 + 243 = 286\n\nTherefore, the base-10 equivalent of the base-3 number 101121 is 286.\n\n<<<286>>>"
