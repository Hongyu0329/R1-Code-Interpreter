    "To convert the base-5 number 324 to base-11, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's break it down:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Base-5 Number\nThe number 324 in base-5 means:\n- The rightmost digit is the least significant digit (LSD).\n- The leftmost digit is the most significant digit (MSD).\n\nIn base-5, each digit represents a power of 5:\n- The rightmost digit (4) is in the 5^0 place.\n- The middle digit (2) is in the 5^1 place.\n- The leftmost digit (3) is in the 5^2 place.\n\n### Step 2: Convert Base-5 to Base-10\nTo convert the base-5 number to base-10, we calculate the sum of each digit multiplied by its respective power of 5:\n\n\\[ 324_{5} = 3 \\times 5^2 + 2 \\times 5^1 + 4 \\times 5^0 \\]\n\nCalculate each term:\n- \\( 3 \\times 5^2 = 3 \\times 25 = 75 \\)\n- \\( 2 \\times 5^1 = 2 \\times 5 = 10 \\)\n- \\( 4 \\times 5^0 = 4 \\times 1 = 4 \\)\n\nAdd these values together to get the base-10 equivalent:\n\\[ 75 + 10 + 4 = 89 \\]\n\nSo, \\( 324_{5} = 89_{10} \\).\n\n### Step 3: Convert Base-10 to Base-11\nNow, we need to convert the base-10 number 89 to base-11.\n\nTo do this, we repeatedly divide the number by 11 and keep track of the remainders:\n\n1. Divide 89 by 11:\n   - Quotient: \\( 89 \\div 11 = 8 \\)\n   - Remainder: \\( 89 \\mod 11 = 1 \\)\n\n2. Divide the quotient (8) by 11:\n   - Quotient: \\( 8 \\div 11 = 0 \\)\n   - Remainder: \\( 8 \\mod 11 = 8 \\)\n\nSince the quotient is now 0, we stop here.\n\n### Step 4: Read the Remainders\nThe base-11 number is read from the last remainder to the first:\n- The remainders are 8 and 1.\n\nThus, the base-11 representation of the number is 81.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe base-5 number 324 is equivalent to the base-11 number 81.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<81>>>"
