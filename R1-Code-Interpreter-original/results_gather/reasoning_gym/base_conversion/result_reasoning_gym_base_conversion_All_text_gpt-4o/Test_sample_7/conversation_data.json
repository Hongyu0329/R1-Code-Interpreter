    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to convert the base-6 number 554 to base-8.\n\n2. **Convert the Base-6 Number to Decimal**:\n   - The base-6 number 554 can be expanded as:\n     \\[\n     5 \\times 6^2 + 5 \\times 6^1 + 4 \\times 6^0\n     \\]\n   - Calculate each term:\n     - \\(5 \\times 6^2 = 5 \\times 36 = 180\\)\n     - \\(5 \\times 6^1 = 5 \\times 6 = 30\\)\n     - \\(4 \\times 6^0 = 4 \\times 1 = 4\\)\n   - Add these values together to get the decimal equivalent:\n     \\[\n     180 + 30 + 4 = 214\n     \\]\n\n3. **Convert the Decimal Number to Base-8**:\n   - We need to convert the decimal number 214 to base-8.\n   - Divide the number by 8 and keep track of the remainders:\n     - \\(214 \\div 8 = 26\\) remainder \\(6\\)\n     - \\(26 \\div 8 = 3\\) remainder \\(2\\)\n     - \\(3 \\div 8 = 0\\) remainder \\(3\\)\n   - The base-8 number is read from the last remainder to the first: \\(326\\).\n\n4. **Final Answer**:\n   - The base-6 number 554 is equivalent to the base-8 number 326.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<326>>>"
