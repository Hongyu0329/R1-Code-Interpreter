    "To convert the base-3 number 2211 to base-14, we need to follow a series of steps:\n\n### Step 1: Convert the base-3 number to a base-10 number.\n\nThe base-3 number 2211 can be expanded as follows:\n\n- The rightmost digit is multiplied by 3^0 (1).\n- The next digit to the left is multiplied by 3^1 (3).\n- The next digit to the left is multiplied by 3^2 (9).\n- The leftmost digit is multiplied by 3^3 (27).\n\nSo, the base-10 equivalent is calculated as:\n\n\\[ 2 \\times 3^3 + 2 \\times 3^2 + 1 \\times 3^1 + 1 \\times 3^0 \\]\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n- \\( 2 \\times 3^3 = 2 \\times 27 = 54 \\)\n- \\( 2 \\times 3^2 = 2 \\times 9 = 18 \\)\n- \\( 1 \\times 3^1 = 1 \\times 3 = 3 \\)\n- \\( 1 \\times 3^0 = 1 \\times 1 = 1 \\)\n\nAdding these values together gives the base-10 number:\n\n\\[ 54 + 18 + 3 + 1 = 76 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Convert the base-10 number to a base-14 number.\n\nNow, we need to convert the base-10 number 76 to base-14.\n\n1. Divide the number by 14 and find the quotient and remainder.\n2. The remainder is the least significant digit (rightmost) in the base-14 number.\n3. Repeat the process with the quotient until the quotient is zero.\n\nPerforming the division:\n\n- \\( 76 \\div 14 = 5 \\) with a remainder of \\( 6 \\).\n- \\( 5 \\div 14 = 0 \\) with a remainder of \\( 5 \\).\n\nSince the quotient is now zero, we stop here. The base-14 number is read from the last remainder to the first, which gives us 56.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe base-3 number 2211 is equivalent to the base-14 number 56.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<56>>>"
