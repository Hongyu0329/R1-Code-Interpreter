    "To convert the base-8 number 307 to base-14, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's break it down:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\n- We have a number in base-8 (octal) and we need to convert it to base-14.\n- Base-8 uses digits 0-7.\n- Base-14 uses digits 0-9 and letters a-d for values 10-13.\n\n### Step 2: Convert Base-8 to Base-10\nFirst, we need to convert the base-8 number to a base-10 (decimal) number. The base-8 number 307 can be expanded as follows:\n\n\\[ 307_{8} = 3 \\times 8^2 + 0 \\times 8^1 + 7 \\times 8^0 \\]\n\nCalculate each term:\n- \\( 3 \\times 8^2 = 3 \\times 64 = 192 \\)\n- \\( 0 \\times 8^1 = 0 \\times 8 = 0 \\)\n- \\( 7 \\times 8^0 = 7 \\times 1 = 7 \\)\n\nAdd these values together to get the base-10 equivalent:\n\\[ 192 + 0 + 7 = 199 \\]\n\nSo, \\( 307_{8} = 199_{10} \\).\n\n### Step 3: Convert Base-10 to Base-14\nNow, we need to convert the base-10 number 199 to base-14. We do this by dividing the number by 14 and keeping track of the remainders.\n\n1. Divide 199 by 14:\n   - \\( 199 \\div 14 = 14 \\) with a remainder of \\( 199 - 14 \\times 14 = 3 \\).\n\n2. Divide the quotient (14) by 14:\n   - \\( 14 \\div 14 = 1 \\) with a remainder of \\( 14 - 14 \\times 1 = 0 \\).\n\n3. Divide the new quotient (1) by 14:\n   - \\( 1 \\div 14 = 0 \\) with a remainder of \\( 1 - 14 \\times 0 = 1 \\).\n\nThe base-14 number is formed by the remainders read from last to first: 103.\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Conversion\nTo ensure accuracy, we can verify by converting 103 in base-14 back to base-10:\n\\[ 103_{14} = 1 \\times 14^2 + 0 \\times 14^1 + 3 \\times 14^0 \\]\n- \\( 1 \\times 14^2 = 1 \\times 196 = 196 \\)\n- \\( 0 \\times 14^1 = 0 \\times 14 = 0 \\)\n- \\( 3 \\times 14^0 = 3 \\times 1 = 3 \\)\n\nAdding these gives:\n\\[ 196 + 0 + 3 = 199 \\]\n\nThe conversion is verified as correct.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe base-8 number 307 is equivalent to the base-14 number 103.\n\n<<<103>>>"
