    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to convert the number 1033 from base-9 to base-13.\n\n2. **Convert the Base-9 Number to Base-10**:\n   - The number 1033 in base-9 can be expanded as:\n     \\[\n     1033_{9} = 1 \\times 9^3 + 0 \\times 9^2 + 3 \\times 9^1 + 3 \\times 9^0\n     \\]\n   - Calculate each term:\n     - \\(1 \\times 9^3 = 1 \\times 729 = 729\\)\n     - \\(0 \\times 9^2 = 0 \\times 81 = 0\\)\n     - \\(3 \\times 9^1 = 3 \\times 9 = 27\\)\n     - \\(3 \\times 9^0 = 3 \\times 1 = 3\\)\n   - Sum these values to get the base-10 equivalent:\n     \\[\n     729 + 0 + 27 + 3 = 759\n     \\]\n   - So, \\(1033_9 = 759_{10}\\).\n\n3. **Convert the Base-10 Number to Base-13**:\n   - We need to convert 759 from base-10 to base-13.\n   - Divide 759 by 13 and find the quotient and remainder:\n     - \\(759 \\div 13 = 58\\) with a remainder of \\(5\\).\n   - The remainder (5) is the least significant digit (rightmost) in base-13.\n   - Now, take the quotient (58) and divide by 13:\n     - \\(58 \\div 13 = 4\\) with a remainder of \\(6\\).\n   - The remainder (6) is the next digit in base-13.\n   - Now, take the quotient (4) and divide by 13:\n     - \\(4 \\div 13 = 0\\) with a remainder of \\(4\\).\n   - The remainder (4) is the most significant digit (leftmost) in base-13.\n   - Since the quotient is now 0, we stop here.\n\n4. **Compile the Base-13 Number**:\n   - Reading the remainders from most significant to least significant, we get the base-13 number: 465.\n\n5. **Final Answer**:\n   - The base-9 number 1033 is equivalent to the base-13 number 465.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<465>>>"
