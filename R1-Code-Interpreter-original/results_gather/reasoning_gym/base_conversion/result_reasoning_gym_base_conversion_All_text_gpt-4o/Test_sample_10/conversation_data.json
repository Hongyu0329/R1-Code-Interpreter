    "To convert the base-3 number 220020 to binary, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to convert a number from base-3 to binary (base-2). The number given is 220020 in base-3.\n\n2. **Convert Base-3 to Decimal**: \n   - Each digit in a base-3 number represents a power of 3, starting from the rightmost digit which is 3^0.\n   - The number 220020 in base-3 can be expanded as:\n     - \\(2 \\times 3^5 + 2 \\times 3^4 + 0 \\times 3^3 + 0 \\times 3^2 + 2 \\times 3^1 + 0 \\times 3^0\\)\n   - Calculate each term:\n     - \\(2 \\times 3^5 = 2 \\times 243 = 486\\)\n     - \\(2 \\times 3^4 = 2 \\times 81 = 162\\)\n     - \\(0 \\times 3^3 = 0\\)\n     - \\(0 \\times 3^2 = 0\\)\n     - \\(2 \\times 3^1 = 2 \\times 3 = 6\\)\n     - \\(0 \\times 3^0 = 0\\)\n   - Sum these values to get the decimal equivalent:\n     - \\(486 + 162 + 0 + 0 + 6 + 0 = 654\\)\n\n3. **Convert Decimal to Binary**:\n   - To convert the decimal number 654 to binary, we repeatedly divide by 2 and record the remainders.\n   - Perform the division:\n     - 654 ÷ 2 = 327 remainder 0\n     - 327 ÷ 2 = 163 remainder 1\n     - 163 ÷ 2 = 81 remainder 1\n     - 81 ÷ 2 = 40 remainder 1\n     - 40 ÷ 2 = 20 remainder 0\n     - 20 ÷ 2 = 10 remainder 0\n     - 10 ÷ 2 = 5 remainder 0\n     - 5 ÷ 2 = 2 remainder 1\n     - 2 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 0\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n   - Read the remainders from bottom to top to get the binary number: 1010001110\n\n4. **Final Answer**: The binary equivalent of the base-3 number 220020 is 1010001110.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1010001110>>>"
