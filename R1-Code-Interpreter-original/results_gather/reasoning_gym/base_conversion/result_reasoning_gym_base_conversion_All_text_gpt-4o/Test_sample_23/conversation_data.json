    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to convert the base-5 number \"332\" to a base-4 number.\n\n2. **Convert the Base-5 Number to Decimal**:\n   - The base-5 number \"332\" can be expanded as:\n     - \\(3 \\times 5^2 + 3 \\times 5^1 + 2 \\times 5^0\\)\n   - Calculate each term:\n     - \\(3 \\times 5^2 = 3 \\times 25 = 75\\)\n     - \\(3 \\times 5^1 = 3 \\times 5 = 15\\)\n     - \\(2 \\times 5^0 = 2 \\times 1 = 2\\)\n   - Sum these values to get the decimal equivalent:\n     - \\(75 + 15 + 2 = 92\\)\n\n3. **Convert the Decimal Number to Base-4**:\n   - We need to convert the decimal number 92 to base-4.\n   - Divide the number by 4 and keep track of the remainders:\n     - \\(92 \\div 4 = 23\\) with a remainder of 0\n     - \\(23 \\div 4 = 5\\) with a remainder of 3\n     - \\(5 \\div 4 = 1\\) with a remainder of 1\n     - \\(1 \\div 4 = 0\\) with a remainder of 1\n   - The base-4 number is obtained by reading the remainders from top to bottom: 1130\n\n4. **Final Answer**:\n   - The base-5 number \"332\" is equivalent to the base-4 number \"1130\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1130>>>"
