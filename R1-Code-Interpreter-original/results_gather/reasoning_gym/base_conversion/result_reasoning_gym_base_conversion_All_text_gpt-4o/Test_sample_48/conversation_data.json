    "To convert a number from base-8 (octal) to base-10 (decimal), we need to understand the positional value of each digit in the base-8 number. Each digit in a base-8 number represents a power of 8, starting from the rightmost digit which is 8^0, then 8^1, 8^2, and so on as we move to the left.\n\nLet's break down the conversion of the base-8 number 426 to base-10 step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the digits and their positions:**\n   - The number 426 in base-8 has three digits: 4, 2, and 6.\n   - The rightmost digit (6) is in the 8^0 position.\n   - The middle digit (2) is in the 8^1 position.\n   - The leftmost digit (4) is in the 8^2 position.\n\n2. **Calculate the decimal value of each digit:**\n   - The rightmost digit (6) contributes: 6 * 8^0 = 6 * 1 = 6\n   - The middle digit (2) contributes: 2 * 8^1 = 2 * 8 = 16\n   - The leftmost digit (4) contributes: 4 * 8^2 = 4 * 64 = 256\n\n3. **Sum the contributions to get the base-10 value:**\n   - Add the contributions from each digit: 256 + 16 + 6 = 278\n\nTherefore, the base-10 equivalent of the base-8 number 426 is 278.\n\n<<<278>>>"
