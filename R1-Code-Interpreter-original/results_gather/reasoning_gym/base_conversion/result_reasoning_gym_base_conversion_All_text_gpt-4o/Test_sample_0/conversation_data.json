    "To convert the hexadecimal number \"4f\" to base-5, we need to follow a series of steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input**: \n   - The given number is \"4f\" in hexadecimal (base-16).\n\n2. **Convert Hexadecimal to Decimal**:\n   - Hexadecimal is base-16, which means it uses digits 0-9 and letters a-f (where a=10, b=11, ..., f=15).\n   - The number \"4f\" in hexadecimal can be broken down as:\n     - The digit '4' is in the 16^1 place.\n     - The digit 'f' is in the 16^0 place.\n   - Calculate the decimal value:\n     - \\(4 \\times 16^1 = 4 \\times 16 = 64\\)\n     - \\(f \\times 16^0 = 15 \\times 1 = 15\\)\n   - Add these values together to get the decimal equivalent:\n     - \\(64 + 15 = 79\\)\n\n3. **Convert Decimal to Base-5**:\n   - Now, we need to convert the decimal number 79 to base-5.\n   - Divide the number by 5 and keep track of the remainders:\n     - \\(79 \\div 5 = 15\\) with a remainder of 4\n     - \\(15 \\div 5 = 3\\) with a remainder of 0\n     - \\(3 \\div 5 = 0\\) with a remainder of 3\n   - The base-5 number is read from the last remainder to the first: 304\n\n4. **Final Answer**:\n   - The base-5 representation of the hexadecimal number \"4f\" is \"304\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<304>>>"
