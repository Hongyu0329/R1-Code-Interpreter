    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to convert the base-8 number 426 to base-9.\n\n2. **Convert the Base-8 Number to Decimal**:\n   - The base-8 number 426 can be expanded as:\n     \\[\n     4 \\times 8^2 + 2 \\times 8^1 + 6 \\times 8^0\n     \\]\n   - Calculate each term:\n     - \\(4 \\times 8^2 = 4 \\times 64 = 256\\)\n     - \\(2 \\times 8^1 = 2 \\times 8 = 16\\)\n     - \\(6 \\times 8^0 = 6 \\times 1 = 6\\)\n   - Sum these values to get the decimal equivalent:\n     \\[\n     256 + 16 + 6 = 278\n     \\]\n\n3. **Convert the Decimal Number to Base-9**:\n   - We need to express 278 in base-9.\n   - Divide the decimal number by 9 and keep track of the remainders:\n     - \\(278 \\div 9 = 30\\) remainder \\(8\\)\n     - \\(30 \\div 9 = 3\\) remainder \\(3\\)\n     - \\(3 \\div 9 = 0\\) remainder \\(3\\)\n   - The base-9 number is read from the last remainder to the first: \\(338_9\\).\n\n4. **Final Answer**:\n   - The base-8 number 426 is equivalent to the base-9 number 338.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<338>>>"
