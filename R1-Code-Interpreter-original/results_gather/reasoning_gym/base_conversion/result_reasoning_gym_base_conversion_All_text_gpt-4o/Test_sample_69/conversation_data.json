    "To convert the base-15 number \"29a\" to base-5, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's break it down:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Base-15 Number\n- The number \"29a\" is in base-15.\n- In base-15, digits range from 0 to 14, where 'a' represents 10.\n\n### Step 2: Convert Base-15 to Base-10\nTo convert \"29a\" from base-15 to base-10, we need to expand it using powers of 15:\n\n- The rightmost digit 'a' (which is 10 in decimal) is in the 15^0 place.\n- The middle digit '9' is in the 15^1 place.\n- The leftmost digit '2' is in the 15^2 place.\n\nCalculate the decimal (base-10) value:\n- \\(2 \\times 15^2 = 2 \\times 225 = 450\\)\n- \\(9 \\times 15^1 = 9 \\times 15 = 135\\)\n- \\(10 \\times 15^0 = 10 \\times 1 = 10\\)\n\nAdd these values together to get the base-10 equivalent:\n- \\(450 + 135 + 10 = 595\\)\n\n### Step 3: Convert Base-10 to Base-5\nNow, convert the base-10 number 595 to base-5:\n\n1. Divide 595 by 5:\n   - 595 รท 5 = 119 with a remainder of 0.\n2. Divide 119 by 5:\n   - 119 รท 5 = 23 with a remainder of 4.\n3. Divide 23 by 5:\n   - 23 รท 5 = 4 with a remainder of 3.\n4. Divide 4 by 5:\n   - 4 รท 5 = 0 with a remainder of 4.\n\nThe remainders, read from bottom to top, give the base-5 number.\n\n### Step 4: Compile the Base-5 Number\nThe base-5 number is 4304.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe base-15 number \"29a\" converts to base-5 as:\n\n<<<4304>>>"
