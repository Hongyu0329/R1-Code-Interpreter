    "To convert the base-3 number 200001 to base-12, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's break it down:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Base-3 Number\nThe number 200001 in base-3 is composed of digits that are valid in base-3, which are 0, 1, and 2. Each digit represents a power of 3, starting from the rightmost digit (which is the least significant digit).\n\n### Step 2: Convert Base-3 to Base-10\nTo convert the base-3 number to base-10, we need to expand it using powers of 3:\n\n- The rightmost digit (1) is multiplied by \\(3^0\\).\n- The next digit (0) is multiplied by \\(3^1\\).\n- The next digit (0) is multiplied by \\(3^2\\).\n- The next digit (0) is multiplied by \\(3^3\\).\n- The next digit (0) is multiplied by \\(3^4\\).\n- The leftmost digit (2) is multiplied by \\(3^5\\).\n\nSo, the base-10 equivalent is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ \n2 \\times 3^5 + 0 \\times 3^4 + 0 \\times 3^3 + 0 \\times 3^2 + 0 \\times 3^1 + 1 \\times 3^0 \n\\]\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n- \\(2 \\times 3^5 = 2 \\times 243 = 486\\)\n- \\(0 \\times 3^4 = 0\\)\n- \\(0 \\times 3^3 = 0\\)\n- \\(0 \\times 3^2 = 0\\)\n- \\(0 \\times 3^1 = 0\\)\n- \\(1 \\times 3^0 = 1\\)\n\nAdding these up gives the base-10 number:\n\n\\[ \n486 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 487 \n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Convert Base-10 to Base-12\nNow, we need to convert the base-10 number 487 to base-12. We do this by dividing the number by 12 and keeping track of the remainders:\n\n1. Divide 487 by 12:\n   - Quotient: 40\n   - Remainder: 7\n\n2. Divide the quotient (40) by 12:\n   - Quotient: 3\n   - Remainder: 4\n\n3. Divide the quotient (3) by 12:\n   - Quotient: 0\n   - Remainder: 3\n\nSince the quotient is now 0, we stop here. The base-12 number is read from the last remainder to the first, which gives us 347.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe base-3 number 200001 is equivalent to the base-12 number 347.\n\n<<<347>>>"
