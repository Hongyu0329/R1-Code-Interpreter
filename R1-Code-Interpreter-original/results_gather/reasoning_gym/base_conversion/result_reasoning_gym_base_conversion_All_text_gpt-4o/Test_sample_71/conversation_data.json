    "To convert the base-9 number 1002 to hexadecimal, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's break it down:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\n- We have a number in base-9: 1002.\n- We need to convert this number to base-16 (hexadecimal).\n\n### Step 2: Convert Base-9 to Base-10\nTo convert a number from base-9 to base-10, we multiply each digit by 9 raised to the power of its position (counting from right to left, starting at 0).\n\n- The number 1002 in base-9 can be broken down as:\n  - \\(1 \\times 9^3\\)\n  - \\(0 \\times 9^2\\)\n  - \\(0 \\times 9^1\\)\n  - \\(2 \\times 9^0\\)\n\nCalculate each term:\n- \\(1 \\times 9^3 = 1 \\times 729 = 729\\)\n- \\(0 \\times 9^2 = 0 \\times 81 = 0\\)\n- \\(0 \\times 9^1 = 0 \\times 9 = 0\\)\n- \\(2 \\times 9^0 = 2 \\times 1 = 2\\)\n\nAdd these values together to get the base-10 equivalent:\n- \\(729 + 0 + 0 + 2 = 731\\)\n\nSo, the base-10 equivalent of 1002 in base-9 is 731.\n\n### Step 3: Convert Base-10 to Base-16\nNow, we need to convert the base-10 number 731 to base-16.\n\n- Divide the number by 16 and keep track of the remainders:\n  - \\(731 \\div 16 = 45\\) remainder \\(11\\) (11 in base-16 is 'b')\n  - \\(45 \\div 16 = 2\\) remainder \\(13\\) (13 in base-16 is 'd')\n  - \\(2 \\div 16 = 0\\) remainder \\(2\\)\n\n- The remainders give us the digits of the base-16 number, read from bottom to top.\n\nThus, the base-16 representation of 731 is 2db.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe base-9 number 1002 is equivalent to the hexadecimal number 2db.\n\n<<<2db>>>"
