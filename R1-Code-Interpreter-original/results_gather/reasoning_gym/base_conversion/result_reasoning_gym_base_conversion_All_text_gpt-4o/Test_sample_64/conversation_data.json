    "To convert the base-7 number 1051 to hexadecimal, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's break it down:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\n- We have a number in base-7, which is 1051.\n- We need to convert this number to base-16 (hexadecimal).\n\n### Step 2: Convert Base-7 to Base-10\nTo convert a number from base-7 to base-10, we multiply each digit by 7 raised to the power of its position (counting from right to left, starting at 0).\n\nFor the number 1051 in base-7:\n- The rightmost digit is 1, and its position is 0: \\(1 \\times 7^0 = 1\\)\n- The next digit is 5, and its position is 1: \\(5 \\times 7^1 = 35\\)\n- The next digit is 0, and its position is 2: \\(0 \\times 7^2 = 0\\)\n- The leftmost digit is 1, and its position is 3: \\(1 \\times 7^3 = 343\\)\n\nAdd these values together to get the base-10 equivalent:\n\\[1 + 35 + 0 + 343 = 379\\]\n\n### Step 3: Convert Base-10 to Base-16\nNow, we need to convert the base-10 number 379 to base-16.\n\n1. Divide the number by 16 and find the quotient and remainder.\n   - \\(379 \\div 16 = 23\\) with a remainder of \\(11\\).\n   - The remainder 11 corresponds to 'b' in hexadecimal.\n\n2. Divide the quotient by 16 again.\n   - \\(23 \\div 16 = 1\\) with a remainder of \\(7\\).\n   - The remainder 7 corresponds to '7' in hexadecimal.\n\n3. Divide the new quotient by 16.\n   - \\(1 \\div 16 = 0\\) with a remainder of \\(1\\).\n   - The remainder 1 corresponds to '1' in hexadecimal.\n\n### Step 4: Combine the Hexadecimal Digits\nThe hexadecimal number is formed by the remainders obtained in reverse order of calculation:\n- From the last division: 1\n- From the second division: 7\n- From the first division: b\n\nThus, the base-16 representation of the base-7 number 1051 is 17b.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe base-7 number 1051 converted to hexadecimal is:\n<<<17b>>>"
