    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to convert the number 424 from base-15 to base-9.\n\n2. **Convert the Base-15 Number to Base-10**:\n   - The number 424 in base-15 can be expanded as:\n     \\[\n     4 \\times 15^2 + 2 \\times 15^1 + 4 \\times 15^0\n     \\]\n   - Calculate each term:\n     - \\(4 \\times 15^2 = 4 \\times 225 = 900\\)\n     - \\(2 \\times 15^1 = 2 \\times 15 = 30\\)\n     - \\(4 \\times 15^0 = 4 \\times 1 = 4\\)\n   - Sum these values to get the base-10 equivalent:\n     \\[\n     900 + 30 + 4 = 934\n     \\]\n   - So, 424 in base-15 is 934 in base-10.\n\n3. **Convert the Base-10 Number to Base-9**:\n   - We need to convert 934 from base-10 to base-9.\n   - Divide 934 by 9 and keep track of the remainders:\n     - \\(934 \\div 9 = 103\\) remainder \\(7\\)\n     - \\(103 \\div 9 = 11\\) remainder \\(4\\)\n     - \\(11 \\div 9 = 1\\) remainder \\(2\\)\n     - \\(1 \\div 9 = 0\\) remainder \\(1\\)\n   - The remainders, read from last to first, give the base-9 number.\n   - Therefore, 934 in base-10 is 1247 in base-9.\n\n4. **Final Answer**:\n   - The base-15 number 424 is equivalent to the base-9 number 1247.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<1247>>>"
