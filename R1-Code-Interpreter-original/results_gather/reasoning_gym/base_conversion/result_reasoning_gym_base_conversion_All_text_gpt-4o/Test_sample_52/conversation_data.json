    "To convert the base-6 number 3245 to hexadecimal, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's break it down:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Bases\n- **Base-6 (Senary)**: Uses digits 0-5.\n- **Hexadecimal (Base-16)**: Uses digits 0-9 and letters a-f for values 10-15.\n\n### Step 2: Convert Base-6 to Decimal\nTo convert a number from base-6 to decimal, we multiply each digit by 6 raised to the power of its position (counting from right, starting at 0).\n\nFor the base-6 number 3245:\n- The rightmost digit is 5, in position 0: \\(5 \\times 6^0 = 5\\)\n- The next digit is 4, in position 1: \\(4 \\times 6^1 = 24\\)\n- The next digit is 2, in position 2: \\(2 \\times 6^2 = 72\\)\n- The leftmost digit is 3, in position 3: \\(3 \\times 6^3 = 648\\)\n\nAdd these values together to get the decimal equivalent:\n\\[5 + 24 + 72 + 648 = 749\\]\n\n### Step 3: Convert Decimal to Hexadecimal\nNow, convert the decimal number 749 to hexadecimal.\n\n1. Divide the decimal number by 16 and record the remainder.\n2. Continue dividing the quotient by 16 until the quotient is 0.\n3. The hexadecimal number is the remainders read from bottom to top.\n\n- \\(749 \\div 16 = 46\\) remainder \\(13\\) (which is 'd' in hexadecimal)\n- \\(46 \\div 16 = 2\\) remainder \\(14\\) (which is 'e' in hexadecimal)\n- \\(2 \\div 16 = 0\\) remainder \\(2\\)\n\nReading the remainders from bottom to top, the hexadecimal representation is 2ed.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe base-6 number 3245 is equivalent to the hexadecimal number 2ed.\n\n<<<2ed>>>"
