    "To convert a number from base-15 to base-10, we need to understand the positional value of each digit in the base-15 number system. In base-15, each digit represents a power of 15, starting from the rightmost digit which is 15^0, then 15^1, 15^2, and so on.\n\nLet's break down the conversion of the base-15 number \"45e\" to base-10 step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the digits and their positions:**\n   - The number \"45e\" in base-15 has three digits: '4', '5', and 'e'.\n   - '4' is in the 15^2 position, '5' is in the 15^1 position, and 'e' is in the 15^0 position.\n\n2. **Convert each digit to its base-10 equivalent:**\n   - In base-15, the digits are 0-9 and then a-e, where 'a' is 10, 'b' is 11, ..., and 'e' is 14.\n   - Therefore, '4' remains 4, '5' remains 5, and 'e' is 14 in base-10.\n\n3. **Calculate the base-10 value of each digit:**\n   - For '4' in the 15^2 position: 4 * (15^2) = 4 * 225 = 900\n   - For '5' in the 15^1 position: 5 * (15^1) = 5 * 15 = 75\n   - For 'e' in the 15^0 position: 14 * (15^0) = 14 * 1 = 14\n\n4. **Sum the base-10 values:**\n   - Add the results from each position: 900 + 75 + 14 = 989\n\n5. **Final result:**\n   - The base-10 equivalent of the base-15 number \"45e\" is 989.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<989>>>"
