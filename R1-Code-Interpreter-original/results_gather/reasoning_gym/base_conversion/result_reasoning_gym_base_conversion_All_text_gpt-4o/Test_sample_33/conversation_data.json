    "To convert a number from base-6 to base-10, we need to understand the place value of each digit in the base-6 number. In base-6, each digit represents a power of 6, starting from the rightmost digit which is 6^0, then 6^1, 6^2, and so on.\n\nLet's break down the conversion of the base-6 number 1544 to base-10 step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the digits and their positions**: \n   - The number 1544 in base-6 has four digits: 1, 5, 4, and 4.\n   - From right to left, these digits are in the positions corresponding to 6^0, 6^1, 6^2, and 6^3.\n\n2. **Calculate the value of each digit in base-10**:\n   - The rightmost digit is 4, and it is in the 6^0 position. So, its value is 4 * 6^0 = 4 * 1 = 4.\n   - The next digit is 4, and it is in the 6^1 position. So, its value is 4 * 6^1 = 4 * 6 = 24.\n   - The next digit is 5, and it is in the 6^2 position. So, its value is 5 * 6^2 = 5 * 36 = 180.\n   - The leftmost digit is 1, and it is in the 6^3 position. So, its value is 1 * 6^3 = 1 * 216 = 216.\n\n3. **Sum the values to get the base-10 equivalent**:\n   - Add up all the values calculated in the previous step: 4 + 24 + 180 + 216.\n\n4. **Perform the addition**:\n   - 4 + 24 = 28\n   - 28 + 180 = 208\n   - 208 + 216 = 424\n\nTherefore, the base-10 equivalent of the base-6 number 1544 is 424.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<424>>>"
