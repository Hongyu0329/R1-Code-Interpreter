    "To convert the base-14 number \"41c\" to binary, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's break it down:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Base-14 Number\n- The number \"41c\" is in base-14.\n- In base-14, digits range from 0 to 9 and then continue with letters a to d, where:\n  - a = 10\n  - b = 11\n  - c = 12\n  - d = 13\n\n### Step 2: Convert Base-14 to Decimal\nTo convert \"41c\" from base-14 to decimal, we need to expand it using powers of 14:\n\n- The rightmost digit is 'c', which is 12 in decimal.\n- The middle digit is '1', which is 1 in decimal.\n- The leftmost digit is '4', which is 4 in decimal.\n\nThe number \"41c\" in base-14 can be expanded as:\n\\[ 4 \\times 14^2 + 1 \\times 14^1 + 12 \\times 14^0 \\]\n\nCalculate each term:\n- \\( 4 \\times 14^2 = 4 \\times 196 = 784 \\)\n- \\( 1 \\times 14^1 = 1 \\times 14 = 14 \\)\n- \\( 12 \\times 14^0 = 12 \\times 1 = 12 \\)\n\nAdd these values together to get the decimal equivalent:\n\\[ 784 + 14 + 12 = 810 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Convert Decimal to Binary\nNow, convert the decimal number 810 to binary. This involves dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainders:\n\n1. 810 ÷ 2 = 405, remainder 0\n2. 405 ÷ 2 = 202, remainder 1\n3. 202 ÷ 2 = 101, remainder 0\n4. 101 ÷ 2 = 50, remainder 1\n5. 50 ÷ 2 = 25, remainder 0\n6. 25 ÷ 2 = 12, remainder 1\n7. 12 ÷ 2 = 6, remainder 0\n8. 6 ÷ 2 = 3, remainder 0\n9. 3 ÷ 2 = 1, remainder 1\n10. 1 ÷ 2 = 0, remainder 1\n\nReading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 810 is:\n\\[ 1100101010 \\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe base-14 number \"41c\" converted to binary is:\n\n<<<1100101010>>>"
