    "To convert the base-4 number 21020 to base-12, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Base-4 Number**: \n   - The number 21020 in base-4 means each digit represents a power of 4, starting from the rightmost digit which is 4^0.\n\n2. **Convert Base-4 to Base-10**:\n   - Break down the number 21020 in base-4:\n     - \\(2 \\times 4^4\\)\n     - \\(1 \\times 4^3\\)\n     - \\(0 \\times 4^2\\)\n     - \\(2 \\times 4^1\\)\n     - \\(0 \\times 4^0\\)\n   - Calculate each term:\n     - \\(2 \\times 4^4 = 2 \\times 256 = 512\\)\n     - \\(1 \\times 4^3 = 1 \\times 64 = 64\\)\n     - \\(0 \\times 4^2 = 0 \\times 16 = 0\\)\n     - \\(2 \\times 4^1 = 2 \\times 4 = 8\\)\n     - \\(0 \\times 4^0 = 0 \\times 1 = 0\\)\n   - Sum these values to get the base-10 equivalent:\n     - \\(512 + 64 + 0 + 8 + 0 = 584\\)\n\n3. **Convert Base-10 to Base-12**:\n   - Start with the base-10 number 584 and divide by 12, keeping track of the quotient and remainder:\n     - \\(584 \\div 12 = 48\\) remainder \\(8\\)\n     - \\(48 \\div 12 = 4\\) remainder \\(0\\)\n     - \\(4 \\div 12 = 0\\) remainder \\(4\\)\n   - The remainders give the digits of the base-12 number, read from bottom to top.\n\n4. **Construct the Base-12 Number**:\n   - The base-12 number is constructed from the remainders: \\(408_{12}\\).\n\nTherefore, the base-4 number 21020 is equivalent to the base-12 number 408.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<408>>>"
