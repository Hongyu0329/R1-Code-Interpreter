    "To convert the base-6 number 3442 to base-7, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Base-6 Number**: \n   - The number 3442 in base-6 means:\n     - \\(3 \\times 6^3\\)\n     - \\(4 \\times 6^2\\)\n     - \\(4 \\times 6^1\\)\n     - \\(2 \\times 6^0\\)\n\n2. **Convert Base-6 to Base-10**:\n   - Calculate each term:\n     - \\(3 \\times 6^3 = 3 \\times 216 = 648\\)\n     - \\(4 \\times 6^2 = 4 \\times 36 = 144\\)\n     - \\(4 \\times 6^1 = 4 \\times 6 = 24\\)\n     - \\(2 \\times 6^0 = 2 \\times 1 = 2\\)\n   - Sum these values to get the base-10 equivalent:\n     - \\(648 + 144 + 24 + 2 = 818\\)\n\n3. **Convert Base-10 to Base-7**:\n   - We need to express 818 in base-7.\n   - Find the largest power of 7 less than or equal to 818:\n     - \\(7^3 = 343\\)\n     - \\(7^4 = 2401\\) (too large)\n   - Determine how many times 343 fits into 818:\n     - \\(818 \\div 343 = 2\\) (integer division)\n     - Remainder: \\(818 - 2 \\times 343 = 132\\)\n   - Next, find how many times 49 (which is \\(7^2\\)) fits into 132:\n     - \\(132 \\div 49 = 2\\)\n     - Remainder: \\(132 - 2 \\times 49 = 34\\)\n   - Next, find how many times 7 (which is \\(7^1\\)) fits into 34:\n     - \\(34 \\div 7 = 4\\)\n     - Remainder: \\(34 - 4 \\times 7 = 6\\)\n   - Finally, the remainder is 6, which is \\(7^0\\).\n\n4. **Compile the Base-7 Number**:\n   - From the calculations above, the base-7 number is 2246.\n\nTherefore, the base-7 equivalent of the base-6 number 3442 is:\n\n<<<2246>>>"
