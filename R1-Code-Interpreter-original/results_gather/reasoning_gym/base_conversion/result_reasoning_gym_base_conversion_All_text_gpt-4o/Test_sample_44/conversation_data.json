    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to convert the base-9 number 461 to base-8.\n\n2. **Convert the Base-9 Number to Base-10**: \n   - The base-9 number 461 can be expanded as:\n     \\[\n     4 \\times 9^2 + 6 \\times 9^1 + 1 \\times 9^0\n     \\]\n   - Calculate each term:\n     - \\(4 \\times 9^2 = 4 \\times 81 = 324\\)\n     - \\(6 \\times 9^1 = 6 \\times 9 = 54\\)\n     - \\(1 \\times 9^0 = 1 \\times 1 = 1\\)\n   - Add these values together to get the base-10 equivalent:\n     \\[\n     324 + 54 + 1 = 379\n     \\]\n\n3. **Convert the Base-10 Number to Base-8**:\n   - We need to convert the base-10 number 379 to base-8.\n   - Divide the number by 8 and keep track of the remainders:\n     - \\(379 \\div 8 = 47\\) remainder \\(3\\)\n     - \\(47 \\div 8 = 5\\) remainder \\(7\\)\n     - \\(5 \\div 8 = 0\\) remainder \\(5\\)\n   - The base-8 number is read from the last remainder to the first: \\(573\\).\n\n4. **Final Answer**: The base-9 number 461 is equivalent to the base-8 number 573.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<573>>>"
