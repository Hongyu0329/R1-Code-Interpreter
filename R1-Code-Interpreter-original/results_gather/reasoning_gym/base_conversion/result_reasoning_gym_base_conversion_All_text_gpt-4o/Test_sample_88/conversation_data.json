    "To convert the base-5 number 4102 to hexadecimal, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's break it down:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Base-5 Number\nThe number 4102 in base-5 means:\n- 4 is in the 5^3 place\n- 1 is in the 5^2 place\n- 0 is in the 5^1 place\n- 2 is in the 5^0 place\n\n### Step 2: Convert Base-5 to Base-10\nTo convert the base-5 number to base-10, we calculate the value as follows:\n- \\(4 \\times 5^3 = 4 \\times 125 = 500\\)\n- \\(1 \\times 5^2 = 1 \\times 25 = 25\\)\n- \\(0 \\times 5^1 = 0 \\times 5 = 0\\)\n- \\(2 \\times 5^0 = 2 \\times 1 = 2\\)\n\nAdd these values together to get the base-10 equivalent:\n\\[500 + 25 + 0 + 2 = 527\\]\n\n### Step 3: Convert Base-10 to Hexadecimal\nNow, we need to convert the base-10 number 527 to hexadecimal. We do this by dividing the number by 16 and keeping track of the remainders:\n\n1. Divide 527 by 16:\n   - Quotient: 32\n   - Remainder: 15\n\n2. Divide 32 by 16:\n   - Quotient: 2\n   - Remainder: 0\n\n3. Divide 2 by 16:\n   - Quotient: 0\n   - Remainder: 2\n\nNow, we write the remainders in reverse order to get the hexadecimal number. The remainders are 2, 0, and 15. In hexadecimal, the digit 15 is represented by the letter 'f'.\n\nThus, the hexadecimal representation is 20f.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe base-5 number 4102 is equivalent to the hexadecimal number 20f.\n\n<<<20f>>>"
