    "To convert the base-15 number \"23e\" to base-6, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's break it down:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Base-15 Number\n- The number \"23e\" is in base-15.\n- In base-15, digits range from 0 to 9 and then continue with letters a (10) to e (14).\n\n### Step 2: Convert Base-15 to Base-10\n- We need to convert \"23e\" from base-15 to base-10 to make it easier to convert to another base.\n- The number \"23e\" in base-15 can be expanded as:\n  - \\(2 \\times 15^2 + 3 \\times 15^1 + e \\times 15^0\\)\n  - Here, 'e' represents 14 in base-10.\n\n- Calculate each term:\n  - \\(2 \\times 15^2 = 2 \\times 225 = 450\\)\n  - \\(3 \\times 15^1 = 3 \\times 15 = 45\\)\n  - \\(e \\times 15^0 = 14 \\times 1 = 14\\)\n\n- Add these values together to get the base-10 equivalent:\n  - \\(450 + 45 + 14 = 509\\)\n\n### Step 3: Convert Base-10 to Base-6\n- Now, we need to convert the base-10 number 509 to base-6.\n- We do this by repeatedly dividing the number by 6 and keeping track of the remainders.\n\n1. Divide 509 by 6:\n   - Quotient: 84, Remainder: 5\n\n2. Divide 84 by 6:\n   - Quotient: 14, Remainder: 0\n\n3. Divide 14 by 6:\n   - Quotient: 2, Remainder: 2\n\n4. Divide 2 by 6:\n   - Quotient: 0, Remainder: 2\n\n- The base-6 number is read from the last remainder to the first: 2205\n\n### Final Answer\nThe base-15 number \"23e\" is equivalent to the base-6 number \"2205\".\n\n<<<2205>>>"
