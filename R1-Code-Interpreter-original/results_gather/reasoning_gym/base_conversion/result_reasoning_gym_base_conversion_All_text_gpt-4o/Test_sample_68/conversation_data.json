    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to convert the base-9 number 175 to a base-14 number. In base-9, the digits range from 0 to 8. In base-14, the digits range from 0 to 9 and then continue with letters a to d for values 10 to 13.\n\n2. **Convert Base-9 to Base-10**: \n   - The number 175 in base-9 can be expanded as:\n     \\[\n     1 \\times 9^2 + 7 \\times 9^1 + 5 \\times 9^0\n     \\]\n   - Calculate each term:\n     - \\(1 \\times 9^2 = 1 \\times 81 = 81\\)\n     - \\(7 \\times 9^1 = 7 \\times 9 = 63\\)\n     - \\(5 \\times 9^0 = 5 \\times 1 = 5\\)\n   - Sum these values to get the base-10 equivalent:\n     \\[\n     81 + 63 + 5 = 149\n     \\]\n   - So, 175 in base-9 is 149 in base-10.\n\n3. **Convert Base-10 to Base-14**:\n   - We need to convert the base-10 number 149 to base-14.\n   - Divide the number by 14 and keep track of the remainders:\n     - \\(149 \\div 14 = 10\\) with a remainder of \\(9\\)\n     - \\(10 \\div 14 = 0\\) with a remainder of \\(10\\)\n   - The remainders give us the digits of the base-14 number, starting from the last remainder to the first:\n     - The first remainder (9) is the least significant digit.\n     - The second remainder (10) is the next digit, which corresponds to 'a' in base-14.\n   - Therefore, the base-14 representation is 'a9'.\n\n4. **Final Answer**: The base-9 number 175 is equivalent to the base-14 number 'a9'.\n\nOutput the final answer in the specified format:\n\n<<<a9>>>"
