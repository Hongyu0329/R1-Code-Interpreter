    "To convert a number from one base to another, we need to understand the value of each digit in the original base and then convert it to the desired base. Here, we are converting a base-15 number to a base-10 number.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Base-15 Number:**\n   - The number given is 119 in base-15.\n   - In base-15, the digits range from 0 to 14, where 10 is represented by 'a', 11 by 'b', 12 by 'c', 13 by 'd', and 14 by 'e'. However, in this number, we only have digits 1 and 9, which are within the range of 0-9, so no letters are involved.\n\n2. **Break Down the Base-15 Number:**\n   - The number 119 in base-15 can be broken down as:\n     - \\(1 \\times 15^2\\) (the hundreds place in base-15)\n     - \\(1 \\times 15^1\\) (the tens place in base-15)\n     - \\(9 \\times 15^0\\) (the units place in base-15)\n\n3. **Calculate Each Term:**\n   - Calculate \\(1 \\times 15^2\\):\n     - \\(15^2 = 225\\)\n     - So, \\(1 \\times 225 = 225\\)\n   - Calculate \\(1 \\times 15^1\\):\n     - \\(15^1 = 15\\)\n     - So, \\(1 \\times 15 = 15\\)\n   - Calculate \\(9 \\times 15^0\\):\n     - \\(15^0 = 1\\)\n     - So, \\(9 \\times 1 = 9\\)\n\n4. **Sum the Values:**\n   - Add the results of each term to get the base-10 equivalent:\n     - \\(225 + 15 + 9 = 249\\)\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   - The base-10 equivalent of the base-15 number 119 is 249.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<249>>>"
