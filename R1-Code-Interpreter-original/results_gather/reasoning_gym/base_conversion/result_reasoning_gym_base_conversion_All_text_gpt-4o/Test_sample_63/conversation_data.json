    "To convert a base-10 number to another base, we need to repeatedly divide the number by the new base and keep track of the remainders. These remainders represent the digits of the number in the new base, starting from the least significant digit (rightmost) to the most significant digit (leftmost).\n\nLet's convert the base-10 number 778 to base-13 step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Number**: Start with the base-10 number 778.\n\n2. **Divide by Base-13**: Divide 778 by 13 and find the quotient and remainder.\n   - 778 รท 13 = 59 with a remainder of 11.\n   - The remainder 11 corresponds to the digit 'b' in base-13 (since a = 10, b = 11, c = 12, etc.).\n\n3. **Next Division**: Take the quotient from the previous division (59) and divide it by 13.\n   - 59 รท 13 = 4 with a remainder of 7.\n   - The remainder 7 is directly used as a digit in base-13.\n\n4. **Final Division**: Take the quotient from the previous division (4) and divide it by 13.\n   - 4 รท 13 = 0 with a remainder of 4.\n   - The remainder 4 is directly used as a digit in base-13.\n\n5. **Compile the Digits**: The remainders collected from each step, read from last to first, give us the number in base-13.\n   - The digits are 4, 7, and b.\n\n6. **Final Base-13 Number**: Combine these digits to form the final number in base-13.\n   - The base-13 representation of 778 is 47b.\n\nTherefore, the base-13 representation of the base-10 number 778 is:\n\n<<<47b>>>"
