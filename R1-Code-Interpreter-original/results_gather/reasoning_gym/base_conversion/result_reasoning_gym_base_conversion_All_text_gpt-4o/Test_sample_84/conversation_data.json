    "To convert the base-13 number \"4c9\" to base-11, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's break it down:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Base-13 Number\n- The number \"4c9\" is in base-13.\n- In base-13, digits range from 0 to 9 and then continue with letters a, b, c, ..., where a = 10, b = 11, c = 12, etc.\n\n### Step 2: Convert Base-13 to Base-10\nTo convert \"4c9\" from base-13 to base-10, we need to evaluate it as follows:\n- The rightmost digit is 9, which is in the 13^0 place.\n- The middle digit is 'c', which is 12 in base-10, and is in the 13^1 place.\n- The leftmost digit is 4, which is in the 13^2 place.\n\nCalculate the base-10 equivalent:\n- \\( 4 \\times 13^2 = 4 \\times 169 = 676 \\)\n- \\( 12 \\times 13^1 = 12 \\times 13 = 156 \\)\n- \\( 9 \\times 13^0 = 9 \\times 1 = 9 \\)\n\nAdd these values together to get the base-10 number:\n- \\( 676 + 156 + 9 = 841 \\)\n\n### Step 3: Convert Base-10 to Base-11\nNow, convert the base-10 number 841 to base-11:\n- Divide 841 by 11 and find the quotient and remainder.\n- \\( 841 \\div 11 = 76 \\) with a remainder of 5.\n- The remainder (5) is the least significant digit (rightmost) in base-11.\n\nContinue with the quotient:\n- \\( 76 \\div 11 = 6 \\) with a remainder of 10.\n- The remainder (10) is represented as 'a' in base-11.\n\nContinue with the quotient:\n- \\( 6 \\div 11 = 0 \\) with a remainder of 6.\n- The remainder (6) is the most significant digit (leftmost) in base-11.\n\n### Step 4: Assemble the Base-11 Number\nFrom the remainders obtained, the base-11 number is assembled from most significant to least significant:\n- The digits are 6, 'a', and 5.\n\nThus, the base-11 representation of the base-13 number \"4c9\" is \"6a5\".\n\n### Final Answer\nThe base-11 equivalent of the base-13 number \"4c9\" is:\n<<<6a5>>>"
