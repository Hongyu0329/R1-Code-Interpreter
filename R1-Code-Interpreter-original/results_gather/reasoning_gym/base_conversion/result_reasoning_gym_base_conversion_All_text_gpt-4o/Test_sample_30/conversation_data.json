    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to convert the number 794 from base-11 to base-4.\n\n2. **Convert the Base-11 Number to Decimal**:\n   - The number 794 in base-11 can be expanded as:\n     \\[\n     7 \\times 11^2 + 9 \\times 11^1 + 4 \\times 11^0\n     \\]\n   - Calculate each term:\n     - \\(7 \\times 11^2 = 7 \\times 121 = 847\\)\n     - \\(9 \\times 11^1 = 9 \\times 11 = 99\\)\n     - \\(4 \\times 11^0 = 4 \\times 1 = 4\\)\n   - Add these values together to get the decimal equivalent:\n     \\[\n     847 + 99 + 4 = 950\n     \\]\n   - So, 794 in base-11 is 950 in decimal.\n\n3. **Convert the Decimal Number to Base-4**:\n   - We need to convert 950 from decimal to base-4.\n   - Divide the number by 4 and keep track of the remainders:\n     - \\(950 \\div 4 = 237\\) remainder \\(2\\)\n     - \\(237 \\div 4 = 59\\) remainder \\(1\\)\n     - \\(59 \\div 4 = 14\\) remainder \\(3\\)\n     - \\(14 \\div 4 = 3\\) remainder \\(2\\)\n     - \\(3 \\div 4 = 0\\) remainder \\(3\\)\n   - The remainders, read from bottom to top, give the base-4 number: 32132.\n\n4. **Final Answer**:\n   - The base-11 number 794 is equivalent to the base-4 number 32132.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<32132>>>"
