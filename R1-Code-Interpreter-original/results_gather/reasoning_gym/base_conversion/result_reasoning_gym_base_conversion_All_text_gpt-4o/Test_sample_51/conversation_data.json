    "To convert the base-15 number \"23d\" to base-9, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's break it down:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Base-15 Number\n- The number \"23d\" is in base-15.\n- In base-15, the digits range from 0 to 9 and then from 'a' to 'e' for values 10 to 14.\n- Here, 'd' represents the decimal value 13.\n\n### Step 2: Convert Base-15 to Decimal\nTo convert \"23d\" from base-15 to decimal, we need to expand it using powers of 15:\n\n- The rightmost digit is 'd', which is 13 in decimal. It is in the 15^0 place.\n- The middle digit is '3', which is 3 in decimal. It is in the 15^1 place.\n- The leftmost digit is '2', which is 2 in decimal. It is in the 15^2 place.\n\nNow, calculate the decimal value:\n\\[ \n2 \\times 15^2 + 3 \\times 15^1 + 13 \\times 15^0 \n\\]\n\nCalculate each term:\n- \\(2 \\times 15^2 = 2 \\times 225 = 450\\)\n- \\(3 \\times 15^1 = 3 \\times 15 = 45\\)\n- \\(13 \\times 15^0 = 13 \\times 1 = 13\\)\n\nAdd them up to get the decimal value:\n\\[ \n450 + 45 + 13 = 508 \n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Convert Decimal to Base-9\nNow, we need to convert the decimal number 508 to base-9.\n\n1. Divide 508 by 9:\n   - 508 รท 9 = 56 remainder 4\n   - The remainder is the least significant digit (rightmost).\n\n2. Divide the quotient 56 by 9:\n   - 56 รท 9 = 6 remainder 2\n   - The remainder is the next digit.\n\n3. Divide the quotient 6 by 9:\n   - 6 รท 9 = 0 remainder 6\n   - The remainder is the most significant digit (leftmost).\n\n### Step 4: Compile the Base-9 Number\nThe remainders from the division steps give us the base-9 number from least significant to most significant digit:\n- The base-9 number is \"624\".\n\n### Final Answer\nThe base-15 number \"23d\" converts to the base-9 number \"624\".\n\n<<<624>>>"
