    "To convert a number from one base to another, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to convert the number 585 from base-11 to base-3.\n\n2. **Convert the Base-11 Number to Decimal**:\n   - The number 585 in base-11 can be expanded as:\n     \\[\n     5 \\times 11^2 + 8 \\times 11^1 + 5 \\times 11^0\n     \\]\n   - Calculate each term:\n     - \\(5 \\times 11^2 = 5 \\times 121 = 605\\)\n     - \\(8 \\times 11^1 = 8 \\times 11 = 88\\)\n     - \\(5 \\times 11^0 = 5 \\times 1 = 5\\)\n   - Sum these values to get the decimal equivalent:\n     \\[\n     605 + 88 + 5 = 698\n     \\]\n   - So, the decimal equivalent of 585 in base-11 is 698.\n\n3. **Convert the Decimal Number to Base-3**:\n   - We need to convert 698 from decimal to base-3.\n   - Divide the number by 3 and keep track of the remainders:\n     - \\(698 \\div 3 = 232\\) remainder \\(2\\)\n     - \\(232 \\div 3 = 77\\) remainder \\(1\\)\n     - \\(77 \\div 3 = 25\\) remainder \\(2\\)\n     - \\(25 \\div 3 = 8\\) remainder \\(1\\)\n     - \\(8 \\div 3 = 2\\) remainder \\(2\\)\n     - \\(2 \\div 3 = 0\\) remainder \\(2\\)\n   - The remainders, read from bottom to top, give the base-3 number: \\(221212\\).\n\n4. **Final Answer**:\n   - The base-3 equivalent of the base-11 number 585 is \\(221212\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<221212>>>"
