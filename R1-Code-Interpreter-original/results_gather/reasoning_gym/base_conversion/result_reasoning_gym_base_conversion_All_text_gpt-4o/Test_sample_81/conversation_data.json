    "To convert a number from one base to another, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's break down the process of converting the base-12 number 27 to base-15:\n\n1. **Understand the Base-12 Number:**\n   - The number 27 in base-12 means:\n     - The digit '2' is in the 12^1 place.\n     - The digit '7' is in the 12^0 place.\n\n2. **Convert Base-12 to Base-10:**\n   - Calculate the decimal (base-10) equivalent of the base-12 number:\n     - \\(2 \\times 12^1 + 7 \\times 12^0\\)\n     - \\(= 2 \\times 12 + 7 \\times 1\\)\n     - \\(= 24 + 7\\)\n     - \\(= 31\\)\n   - So, the base-10 equivalent of the base-12 number 27 is 31.\n\n3. **Convert Base-10 to Base-15:**\n   - Now, convert the decimal number 31 to base-15:\n     - Divide the number by 15 and keep track of the quotient and remainder.\n     - \\(31 \\div 15 = 2\\) with a remainder of 1.\n     - The quotient is 2, and the remainder is 1.\n     - Since the quotient is less than 15, it becomes the next digit.\n   - Therefore, the base-15 representation is:\n     - The remainder (1) is the least significant digit.\n     - The quotient (2) is the next digit.\n   - So, the base-15 number is 21.\n\n4. **Final Answer:**\n   - The base-12 number 27 is equivalent to the base-15 number 21.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<21>>>"
