    "To convert the base-5 number 4042 to base-11, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's break it down:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Base-5 Number\nThe number 4042 in base-5 means:\n- The rightmost digit is the least significant digit (LSD).\n- Each digit represents a power of 5, starting from 0 on the right.\n\nSo, 4042 in base-5 can be expanded as:\n- \\(4 \\times 5^3\\)\n- \\(0 \\times 5^2\\)\n- \\(4 \\times 5^1\\)\n- \\(2 \\times 5^0\\)\n\n### Step 2: Convert Base-5 to Base-10\nCalculate the decimal (base-10) equivalent of the base-5 number:\n\n1. \\(4 \\times 5^3 = 4 \\times 125 = 500\\)\n2. \\(0 \\times 5^2 = 0 \\times 25 = 0\\)\n3. \\(4 \\times 5^1 = 4 \\times 5 = 20\\)\n4. \\(2 \\times 5^0 = 2 \\times 1 = 2\\)\n\nAdd these values together to get the base-10 equivalent:\n\\[500 + 0 + 20 + 2 = 522\\]\n\n### Step 3: Convert Base-10 to Base-11\nNow, convert the decimal number 522 to base-11:\n\n1. Divide 522 by 11:\n   - \\(522 \\div 11 = 47\\) remainder \\(5\\)\n   - The remainder is the least significant digit (LSD) in base-11.\n\n2. Divide the quotient (47) by 11:\n   - \\(47 \\div 11 = 4\\) remainder \\(3\\)\n   - The remainder is the next digit in base-11.\n\n3. Divide the quotient (4) by 11:\n   - \\(4 \\div 11 = 0\\) remainder \\(4\\)\n   - The remainder is the most significant digit (MSD) in base-11.\n\n### Step 4: Compile the Base-11 Number\nThe base-11 number is compiled from the remainders, starting from the last division:\n- MSD to LSD: 435\n\nThus, the base-5 number 4042 is equivalent to the base-11 number 435.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe base-11 representation of the base-5 number 4042 is:\n<<<435>>>"
