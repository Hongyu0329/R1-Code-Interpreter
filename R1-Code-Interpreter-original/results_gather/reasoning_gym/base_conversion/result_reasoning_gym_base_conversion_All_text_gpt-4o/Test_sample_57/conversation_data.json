    "To convert the base-14 number \"5d\" to base-11, we need to follow a series of steps. Let's break it down:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Input\n- The number \"5d\" is in base-14.\n- In base-14, digits range from 0 to 9 and then continue with letters a to d, where:\n  - a = 10\n  - b = 11\n  - c = 12\n  - d = 13\n\n### Step 2: Convert Base-14 to Base-10\nTo convert \"5d\" from base-14 to base-10, we need to evaluate it as follows:\n- The number \"5d\" in base-14 can be expanded as:\n  - \\(5 \\times 14^1 + d \\times 14^0\\)\n\nSubstitute the values:\n- \\(5 \\times 14^1 = 5 \\times 14 = 70\\)\n- \\(d \\times 14^0 = 13 \\times 1 = 13\\)\n\nAdd these values together to get the base-10 equivalent:\n- \\(70 + 13 = 83\\)\n\nSo, \"5d\" in base-14 is equivalent to 83 in base-10.\n\n### Step 3: Convert Base-10 to Base-11\nNow, we need to convert the base-10 number 83 to base-11.\n\nTo do this, we perform successive division by 11 and keep track of the remainders:\n1. Divide 83 by 11:\n   - Quotient: \\(83 \\div 11 = 7\\)\n   - Remainder: \\(83 \\mod 11 = 6\\)\n\n2. Divide the quotient (7) by 11:\n   - Quotient: \\(7 \\div 11 = 0\\)\n   - Remainder: \\(7 \\mod 11 = 7\\)\n\nSince the quotient is now 0, we stop here.\n\n### Step 4: Construct the Base-11 Number\nThe base-11 number is constructed by reading the remainders from last to first:\n- The remainders are 7 and 6, so the base-11 number is \"76\".\n\n### Final Answer\nThe base-14 number \"5d\" is equivalent to \"76\" in base-11.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<76>>>"
