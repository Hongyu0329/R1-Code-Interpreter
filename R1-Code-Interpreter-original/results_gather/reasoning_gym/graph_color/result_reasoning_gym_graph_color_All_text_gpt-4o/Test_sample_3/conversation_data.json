    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have 10 vertices and 6 edges, and we can use up to 3 different colors.\n\nLet's analyze the graph step by step:\n\n1. **Vertices and Edges**: \n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(1, 9), (2, 5), (2, 7), (3, 6), (3, 8), (4, 5)]\n\n2. **Graph Structure**:\n   - Vertex 1 is connected to vertex 9.\n   - Vertex 2 is connected to vertices 5 and 7.\n   - Vertex 3 is connected to vertices 6 and 8.\n   - Vertex 4 is connected to vertex 5.\n\n3. **Color Assignment Strategy**:\n   - We will start by coloring the vertices with the least number of connections first, as they have fewer constraints.\n   - We will use colors 1, 2, and 3.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Coloring**:\n   - **Vertex 0**: No edges, can be any color. Let's choose color 1.\n   - **Vertex 1**: Connected to vertex 9. Assign color 1 to vertex 1.\n   - **Vertex 9**: Connected to vertex 1, which is color 1. Assign color 2 to vertex 9.\n   - **Vertex 2**: Connected to vertices 5 and 7. Assign color 1 to vertex 2.\n   - **Vertex 5**: Connected to vertices 2 and 4. Vertex 2 is color 1, so assign color 2 to vertex 5.\n   - **Vertex 7**: Connected to vertex 2, which is color 1. Assign color 2 to vertex 7.\n   - **Vertex 3**: Connected to vertices 6 and 8. Assign color 1 to vertex 3.\n   - **Vertex 6**: Connected to vertex 3, which is color 1. Assign color 2 to vertex 6.\n   - **Vertex 8**: Connected to vertex 3, which is color 1. Assign color 2 to vertex 8.\n   - **Vertex 4**: Connected to vertex 5, which is color 2. Assign color 1 to vertex 4.\n\n5. **Final Coloring**:\n   - Vertex 0: Color 1\n   - Vertex 1: Color 1\n   - Vertex 2: Color 1\n   - Vertex 3: Color 1\n   - Vertex 4: Color 1\n   - Vertex 5: Color 2\n   - Vertex 6: Color 2\n   - Vertex 7: Color 2\n   - Vertex 8: Color 2\n   - Vertex 9: Color 2\n\nThe final coloring ensures that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nThe solution in JSON format is:\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 2, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 2, \"8\": 2, \"9\": 2}>>>"
