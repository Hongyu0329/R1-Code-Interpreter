    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have three colors available: 1, 2, and 3. Let's analyze the graph step by step:\n\n1. **Vertices and Edges**: \n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(0, 1), (0, 7), (0, 9), (1, 4), (2, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (6, 8), (7, 9)]\n\n2. **Graph Structure**:\n   - Vertex 0 is connected to vertices 1, 7, and 9.\n   - Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 0 and 4.\n   - Vertex 2 is connected to vertex 4.\n   - Vertex 3 is connected to vertices 5 and 6.\n   - Vertex 4 is connected to vertices 1 and 2.\n   - Vertex 5 is connected to vertex 3.\n   - Vertex 6 is connected to vertices 3 and 8.\n   - Vertex 7 is connected to vertices 0 and 9.\n   - Vertex 8 is connected to vertex 6.\n   - Vertex 9 is connected to vertices 0 and 7.\n\n3. **Coloring Strategy**:\n   - Start with vertex 0 and assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 1 is adjacent to vertex 0, so assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 7 is adjacent to vertex 0, so assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 9 is adjacent to vertices 0 and 7, so assign it color 3.\n   - Vertex 4 is adjacent to vertex 1, so assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 2 is adjacent to vertex 4, so assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 3 is not adjacent to any colored vertex yet, so assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 5 is adjacent to vertex 3, so assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 6 is adjacent to vertex 3, so assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 8 is adjacent to vertex 6, so assign it color 1.\n\n4. **Final Coloring**:\n   - Vertex 0: Color 1\n   - Vertex 1: Color 2\n   - Vertex 2: Color 2\n   - Vertex 3: Color 1\n   - Vertex 4: Color 1\n   - Vertex 5: Color 2\n   - Vertex 6: Color 2\n   - Vertex 7: Color 2\n   - Vertex 8: Color 1\n   - Vertex 9: Color 3\n\nThe final coloring ensures that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. The solution can be represented as a JSON map:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 2, \"2\": 2, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 2, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 2, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 3}>>>"
