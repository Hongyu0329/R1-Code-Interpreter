    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have 10 vertices and 5 edges, and we can use up to 3 different colors.\n\nLet's analyze the graph step by step:\n\n1. **Vertices and Edges**: \n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(0, 4), (1, 6), (2, 6), (4, 7), (7, 8)]\n\n2. **Graph Structure**:\n   - Vertex 0 is connected to vertex 4.\n   - Vertex 1 is connected to vertex 6.\n   - Vertex 2 is connected to vertex 6.\n   - Vertex 4 is connected to vertex 7.\n   - Vertex 7 is connected to vertex 8.\n\n3. **Color Assignment**:\n   - We have 3 colors available: [1, 2, 3].\n   - Start by coloring vertex 0 with color 1.\n   - Vertex 4 is adjacent to vertex 0, so it cannot be color 1. Assign color 2 to vertex 4.\n   - Vertex 7 is adjacent to vertex 4, so it cannot be color 2. Assign color 1 to vertex 7.\n   - Vertex 8 is adjacent to vertex 7, so it cannot be color 1. Assign color 2 to vertex 8.\n   - Vertex 1 is not adjacent to any colored vertex yet, so assign color 1 to vertex 1.\n   - Vertex 6 is adjacent to vertex 1, so it cannot be color 1. Assign color 2 to vertex 6.\n   - Vertex 2 is adjacent to vertex 6, so it cannot be color 2. Assign color 1 to vertex 2.\n   - Vertices 3, 5, and 9 are not adjacent to any other vertices, so they can be assigned any color. Assign color 1 to vertex 3, color 1 to vertex 5, and color 1 to vertex 9.\n\n4. **Final Coloring**:\n   - Vertex 0: Color 1\n   - Vertex 1: Color 1\n   - Vertex 2: Color 1\n   - Vertex 3: Color 1\n   - Vertex 4: Color 2\n   - Vertex 5: Color 1\n   - Vertex 6: Color 2\n   - Vertex 7: Color 1\n   - Vertex 8: Color 2\n   - Vertex 9: Color 1\n\nThe final coloring ensures that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nThe solution in JSON format is:\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 2, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 2, \"9\": 1}>>>"
