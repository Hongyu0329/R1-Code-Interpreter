    "To solve the problem of coloring the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color, we need to carefully analyze the graph's structure and apply a graph coloring strategy. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Graph Structure:**\n   - The graph has 10 vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n   - The edges are: (0, 1), (0, 6), (5, 9), (6, 8), (8, 9).\n\n2. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - Each vertex must be colored such that no two adjacent vertices (connected by an edge) have the same color.\n   - We have three possible colors: 1, 2, and 3.\n\n3. **Plan the Coloring:**\n   - Start with vertex 0 and assign it the first color, say color 1.\n   - Move to vertex 1, which is adjacent to vertex 0, and assign it a different color, say color 2.\n   - Vertex 6 is also adjacent to vertex 0, so it cannot be color 1. Assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 8 is adjacent to vertex 6, so it cannot be color 2. Assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 9 is adjacent to vertex 8, so it cannot be color 1. Assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 5 is adjacent to vertex 9, so it cannot be color 2. Assign it color 1.\n   - Vertices 2, 3, 4, and 7 are not connected to any other vertices in the given edges, so they can be assigned any color. For simplicity, assign them color 1.\n\n4. **Verify the Coloring:**\n   - Check each edge to ensure no two connected vertices share the same color:\n     - (0, 1): Colors are 1 and 2.\n     - (0, 6): Colors are 1 and 2.\n     - (5, 9): Colors are 1 and 2.\n     - (6, 8): Colors are 2 and 1.\n     - (8, 9): Colors are 1 and 2.\n   - All edges satisfy the coloring condition.\n\n5. **Construct the JSON Map:**\n   - Create a JSON map of vertices to their assigned colors.\n\nThe final coloring solution is:\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 2, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 2}>>>"
