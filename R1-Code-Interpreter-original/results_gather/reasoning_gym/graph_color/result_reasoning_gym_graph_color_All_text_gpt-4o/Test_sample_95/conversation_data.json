    "To solve the problem of coloring the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color, we need to carefully analyze the given graph properties and constraints. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Graph Structure:**\n   - **Vertices:** [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - **Edges:** [(0, 4), (1, 4), (5, 9)]\n\n2. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - Each vertex must be assigned a color from the set [1, 2, 3].\n   - Adjacent vertices (connected by an edge) must not share the same color.\n\n3. **Analyze the Edges:**\n   - The edge (0, 4) means vertices 0 and 4 must have different colors.\n   - The edge (1, 4) means vertices 1 and 4 must have different colors.\n   - The edge (5, 9) means vertices 5 and 9 must have different colors.\n\n4. **Assign Colors:**\n   - Start with vertex 0 and assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 4 is adjacent to vertex 0, so it cannot be color 1. Assign vertex 4 color 2.\n   - Vertex 1 is adjacent to vertex 4, so it cannot be color 2. Assign vertex 1 color 1.\n   - Vertex 5 can be assigned any color since it is not adjacent to any colored vertex yet. Assign vertex 5 color 1.\n   - Vertex 9 is adjacent to vertex 5, so it cannot be color 1. Assign vertex 9 color 2.\n   - Vertices 2, 3, 6, 7, and 8 are not adjacent to any other vertices with assigned colors, so they can be assigned any color. Assign them color 1 for simplicity.\n\n5. **Verify the Coloring:**\n   - Check that all adjacent vertices have different colors:\n     - (0, 4): 0 is color 1, 4 is color 2.\n     - (1, 4): 1 is color 1, 4 is color 2.\n     - (5, 9): 5 is color 1, 9 is color 2.\n   - All constraints are satisfied.\n\n6. **Construct the JSON Map:**\n   - Create a JSON map of vertices to their assigned colors.\n\nThe final coloring solution is:\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 2, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 2}>>>"
