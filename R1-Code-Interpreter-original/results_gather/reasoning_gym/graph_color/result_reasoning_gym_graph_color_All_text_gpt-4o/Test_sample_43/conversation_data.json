    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. The graph is defined by its vertices and edges, and we have three possible colors to use.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the vertices and edges:**\n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(4, 5), (4, 8), (5, 7)]\n\n2. **Understand the constraints:**\n   - Vertices connected by an edge must have different colors.\n   - We have three colors available: [1, 2, 3].\n\n3. **Plan the coloring:**\n   - Start with vertex 4, which is connected to vertices 5 and 8. Assign it the first color, say color 1.\n   - Vertex 5 is connected to vertices 4 and 7. Since vertex 4 is color 1, assign vertex 5 a different color, say color 2.\n   - Vertex 8 is connected to vertex 4. Since vertex 4 is color 1, assign vertex 8 a different color, say color 2.\n   - Vertex 7 is connected to vertex 5. Since vertex 5 is color 2, assign vertex 7 a different color, say color 1.\n\n4. **Assign colors to the remaining vertices:**\n   - Vertices 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9 are not connected to any other vertices in the given edges, so they can be assigned any color. For simplicity, assign them color 1.\n\n5. **Verify the solution:**\n   - Check that no two connected vertices share the same color:\n     - Edge (4, 5): Vertex 4 is color 1, vertex 5 is color 2.\n     - Edge (4, 8): Vertex 4 is color 1, vertex 8 is color 2.\n     - Edge (5, 7): Vertex 5 is color 2, vertex 7 is color 1.\n   - All constraints are satisfied.\n\n6. **Create the JSON map:**\n   - Assign colors to each vertex based on the above plan.\n\nThe final coloring solution is:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 2, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 2, \"9\": 1}>>>"
