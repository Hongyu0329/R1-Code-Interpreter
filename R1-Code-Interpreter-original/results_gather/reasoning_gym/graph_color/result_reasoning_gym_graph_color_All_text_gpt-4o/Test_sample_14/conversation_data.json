    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have 10 vertices and 6 edges, and we can use up to 3 different colors.\n\nLet's analyze the graph step by step:\n\n1. **Vertices and Edges**: \n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(0, 8), (0, 9), (2, 3), (2, 8), (4, 7), (8, 9)]\n\n2. **Graph Structure**:\n   - Vertex 0 is connected to vertices 8 and 9.\n   - Vertex 2 is connected to vertices 3 and 8.\n   - Vertex 4 is connected to vertex 7.\n   - Vertex 8 is connected to vertices 0, 2, and 9.\n   - Vertex 9 is connected to vertices 0 and 8.\n\n3. **Color Assignment Strategy**:\n   - Start with vertex 0 and assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 8 is adjacent to vertex 0, so assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 9 is adjacent to vertices 0 and 8, so assign it color 3.\n   - Vertex 2 is not adjacent to 0, 8, or 9, so assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 3 is adjacent to vertex 2, so assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 4 is not adjacent to any colored vertex, so assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 7 is adjacent to vertex 4, so assign it color 2.\n   - Vertices 1, 5, and 6 are isolated (no edges), so they can be assigned any color. Assign them color 1.\n\n4. **Final Color Assignment**:\n   - Vertex 0: Color 1\n   - Vertex 1: Color 1\n   - Vertex 2: Color 1\n   - Vertex 3: Color 2\n   - Vertex 4: Color 1\n   - Vertex 5: Color 1\n   - Vertex 6: Color 1\n   - Vertex 7: Color 2\n   - Vertex 8: Color 2\n   - Vertex 9: Color 3\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - Check each edge to ensure no two connected vertices share the same color:\n     - (0, 8): Colors 1 and 2\n     - (0, 9): Colors 1 and 3\n     - (2, 3): Colors 1 and 2\n     - (2, 8): Colors 1 and 2\n     - (4, 7): Colors 1 and 2\n     - (8, 9): Colors 2 and 3\n\nAll edges satisfy the condition that no two connected vertices share the same color.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 2, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 2, \"8\": 2, \"9\": 3}>>>"
