    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have 10 vertices and 4 edges, and we can use up to 3 different colors.\n\nLet's analyze the graph step by step:\n\n1. **Vertices and Edges**: \n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(1, 3), (1, 5), (5, 8), (7, 8)]\n\n2. **Graph Structure**:\n   - Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 3 and 5.\n   - Vertex 5 is connected to vertices 1 and 8.\n   - Vertex 8 is connected to vertices 5 and 7.\n   - Vertex 7 is connected to vertex 8.\n\n3. **Color Assignment Strategy**:\n   - We will start by coloring the vertices with the highest degree (most connections) first, which helps in minimizing conflicts.\n   - We have 3 colors available: [1, 2, 3].\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Coloring**:\n   - **Vertex 1**: It is connected to vertices 3 and 5. Assign color 1 to vertex 1.\n   - **Vertex 3**: It is connected to vertex 1. Assign color 2 to vertex 3 (different from vertex 1).\n   - **Vertex 5**: It is connected to vertices 1 and 8. Assign color 2 to vertex 5 (different from vertex 1).\n   - **Vertex 8**: It is connected to vertices 5 and 7. Assign color 1 to vertex 8 (different from vertex 5).\n   - **Vertex 7**: It is connected to vertex 8. Assign color 2 to vertex 7 (different from vertex 8).\n\n5. **Remaining Vertices**:\n   - Vertices 0, 2, 4, 6, and 9 are not connected to any other vertices, so they can be assigned any color. For simplicity, assign color 1 to all of them.\n\n6. **Final Coloring**:\n   - Vertex 0: Color 1\n   - Vertex 1: Color 1\n   - Vertex 2: Color 1\n   - Vertex 3: Color 2\n   - Vertex 4: Color 1\n   - Vertex 5: Color 2\n   - Vertex 6: Color 1\n   - Vertex 7: Color 2\n   - Vertex 8: Color 1\n   - Vertex 9: Color 1\n\nThe final coloring ensures that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nThe solution in JSON format is:\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 2, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 2, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 2, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 1}>>>"
