    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have 10 vertices and 4 edges, and we can use up to 3 different colors.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the vertices and edges:**\n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(1, 5), (1, 9), (3, 6), (7, 9)]\n\n2. **Understand the constraints:**\n   - Each vertex must be assigned one of the colors [1, 2, 3].\n   - No two vertices connected by an edge can have the same color.\n\n3. **Plan the coloring:**\n   - Start by coloring the vertices connected by edges, as these have constraints.\n   - Use the minimum number of colors necessary to satisfy the constraints.\n\n4. **Color the vertices:**\n   - Start with vertex 1. Assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 5 is connected to vertex 1, so it cannot be color 1. Assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 9 is also connected to vertex 1, so it cannot be color 1. Assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 3 is not yet colored. Assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 6 is connected to vertex 3, so it cannot be color 1. Assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 7 is not yet colored. Assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 9 is already colored, and it is connected to vertex 7. Since vertex 9 is color 2, vertex 7 can remain color 1.\n   - Vertices 0, 2, 4, and 8 are not connected to any other vertices by edges, so they can be any color. Assign them color 1 for simplicity.\n\n5. **Verify the solution:**\n   - Check each edge to ensure no two connected vertices share the same color:\n     - Edge (1, 5): Colors are 1 and 2.\n     - Edge (1, 9): Colors are 1 and 2.\n     - Edge (3, 6): Colors are 1 and 2.\n     - Edge (7, 9): Colors are 1 and 2.\n   - All constraints are satisfied.\n\n6. **Create the JSON map:**\n   - Assign the colors to each vertex as determined.\n\nThe final coloring solution is:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 2, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 2}>>>"
