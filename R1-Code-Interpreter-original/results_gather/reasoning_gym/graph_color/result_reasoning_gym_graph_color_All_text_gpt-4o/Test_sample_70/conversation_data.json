    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have 10 vertices and 4 edges, and we can use 3 different colors. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the vertices and edges:**\n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(1, 9), (2, 3), (3, 7), (5, 9)]\n\n2. **Understand the constraints:**\n   - Each vertex must be colored such that no two vertices connected by an edge have the same color.\n   - We have 3 colors available: [1, 2, 3].\n\n3. **Plan the coloring:**\n   - Start with vertices that have the most connections (highest degree) to minimize conflicts.\n   - Assign colors to these vertices first, then proceed to less connected vertices.\n\n4. **Color the vertices:**\n   - Vertex 1 is connected to vertex 9. Assign color 1 to vertex 1.\n   - Vertex 9 is connected to vertex 1 and vertex 5. Assign color 2 to vertex 9.\n   - Vertex 5 is connected to vertex 9. Assign color 1 to vertex 5.\n   - Vertex 2 is connected to vertex 3. Assign color 1 to vertex 2.\n   - Vertex 3 is connected to vertex 2 and vertex 7. Assign color 2 to vertex 3.\n   - Vertex 7 is connected to vertex 3. Assign color 1 to vertex 7.\n\n5. **Assign colors to remaining vertices:**\n   - Vertices 0, 4, 6, and 8 are not connected to any other vertices, so they can be assigned any color. For simplicity, assign color 1 to these vertices.\n\n6. **Verify the solution:**\n   - Check each edge to ensure no two connected vertices share the same color:\n     - (1, 9): Colors are 1 and 2.\n     - (2, 3): Colors are 1 and 2.\n     - (3, 7): Colors are 2 and 1.\n     - (5, 9): Colors are 1 and 2.\n   - All constraints are satisfied.\n\n7. **Prepare the JSON map:**\n   - Create a JSON map of vertices to their assigned colors.\n\nThe final coloring solution is:\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 2, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 2}>>>"
