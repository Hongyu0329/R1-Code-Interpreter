    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have 10 vertices and 4 edges, and we can use 3 different colors. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the vertices and edges**: \n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(3, 8), (4, 5), (5, 6), (5, 8)]\n\n2. **Understand the constraints**:\n   - Vertices connected by an edge must have different colors.\n   - We have 3 colors available: [1, 2, 3].\n\n3. **Plan the coloring**:\n   - Start with a vertex and assign it a color.\n   - Move to an adjacent vertex and assign it a different color.\n   - Continue this process, ensuring no two connected vertices share the same color.\n\n4. **Color the graph**:\n   - Start with vertex 3 and assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 8 is connected to vertex 3, so assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 4 is not connected to 3 or 8, so assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 5 is connected to vertex 4, so assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 6 is connected to vertex 5, so assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 5 is also connected to vertex 8, which already has color 2, so this is consistent.\n   - Vertices 0, 1, 2, 7, and 9 are not connected to any other vertices, so they can be assigned any color. For simplicity, assign them color 1.\n\n5. **Verify the solution**:\n   - Check each edge to ensure connected vertices have different colors:\n     - (3, 8): Colors are 1 and 2.\n     - (4, 5): Colors are 1 and 2.\n     - (5, 6): Colors are 2 and 1.\n     - (5, 8): Colors are 2 and 2, which is incorrect. Adjust vertex 8 to color 3.\n\n6. **Adjust and finalize the coloring**:\n   - Reassign vertex 8 to color 3 to resolve the conflict with vertex 5.\n   - Verify again:\n     - (3, 8): Colors are 1 and 3.\n     - (4, 5): Colors are 1 and 2.\n     - (5, 6): Colors are 2 and 1.\n     - (5, 8): Colors are 2 and 3.\n\n7. **Output the solution**:\n   - The final coloring is consistent with the constraints.\n\nThe final coloring of the graph is:\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 2, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 3, \"9\": 1}>>>"
