    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have three colors available: 1, 2, and 3. Let's analyze the graph step by step:\n\n1. **Vertices and Edges**: \n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(0, 1), (1, 5), (1, 7), (1, 8), (4, 8), (6, 7), (6, 8)]\n\n2. **Graph Structure**:\n   - Vertex 0 is connected to 1.\n   - Vertex 1 is connected to 0, 5, 7, and 8.\n   - Vertex 4 is connected to 8.\n   - Vertex 6 is connected to 7 and 8.\n   - Vertex 7 is connected to 1 and 6.\n   - Vertex 8 is connected to 1, 4, and 6.\n   - Vertices 2, 3, and 9 are isolated (no edges).\n\n3. **Coloring Strategy**:\n   - Start with vertex 0 and assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 1 is adjacent to 0, so assign it a different color, say 2.\n   - Vertex 5 is adjacent to 1, so assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 7 is adjacent to 1, so assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 8 is adjacent to 1, so assign it color 3.\n   - Vertex 4 is adjacent to 8, so assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 6 is adjacent to 7 and 8, so assign it color 2.\n   - Vertices 2, 3, and 9 are isolated, so they can be assigned any color. Assign them color 1 for simplicity.\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   - Check each edge to ensure no two connected vertices have the same color:\n     - (0, 1): Colors are 1 and 2.\n     - (1, 5): Colors are 2 and 1.\n     - (1, 7): Colors are 2 and 1.\n     - (1, 8): Colors are 2 and 3.\n     - (4, 8): Colors are 1 and 3.\n     - (6, 7): Colors are 2 and 1.\n     - (6, 8): Colors are 2 and 3.\n   - All conditions are satisfied.\n\n5. **Final Coloring**:\n   - Vertex 0: Color 1\n   - Vertex 1: Color 2\n   - Vertex 2: Color 1\n   - Vertex 3: Color 1\n   - Vertex 4: Color 1\n   - Vertex 5: Color 1\n   - Vertex 6: Color 2\n   - Vertex 7: Color 1\n   - Vertex 8: Color 3\n   - Vertex 9: Color 1\n\nThe final solution is:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 2, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 3, \"9\": 1}>>>"
