    "To solve the problem of coloring the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color, we need to carefully analyze the given graph properties and constraints. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Graph Structure:**\n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(2, 4), (3, 7), (5, 8), (7, 9)]\n\n2. **Understand the Coloring Constraint:**\n   - We need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two vertices connected by an edge have the same color.\n   - Available colors: [1, 2, 3]\n\n3. **Analyze the Graph:**\n   - The graph is sparse, with only four edges, meaning most vertices are isolated and can be colored independently.\n   - The edges connect the following pairs of vertices:\n     - (2, 4)\n     - (3, 7)\n     - (5, 8)\n     - (7, 9)\n\n4. **Color the Graph:**\n   - Start by coloring the vertices connected by edges, ensuring no two connected vertices share the same color.\n   - For edge (2, 4), assign different colors to vertices 2 and 4. For example, color 2 with 1 and 4 with 2.\n   - For edge (3, 7), assign different colors to vertices 3 and 7. For example, color 3 with 1 and 7 with 2.\n   - For edge (5, 8), assign different colors to vertices 5 and 8. For example, color 5 with 1 and 8 with 2.\n   - For edge (7, 9), vertex 7 is already colored with 2, so color vertex 9 with a different color, such as 1.\n\n5. **Color the Remaining Vertices:**\n   - The remaining vertices (0, 1, 6) are not connected by any edges, so they can be colored with any of the available colors. For simplicity, assign them the same color, such as 1.\n\n6. **Construct the JSON Map:**\n   - Create a JSON map of vertices to their assigned colors.\n\nFollowing these steps, the coloring of the graph can be represented as:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 2, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 2, \"8\": 2, \"9\": 1}>>>"
