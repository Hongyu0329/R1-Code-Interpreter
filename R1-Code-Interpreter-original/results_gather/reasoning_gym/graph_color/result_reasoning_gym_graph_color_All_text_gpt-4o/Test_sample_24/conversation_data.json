    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have 10 vertices and 6 edges, and we can use up to 3 colors.\n\nLet's analyze the graph step by step:\n\n1. **Vertices and Edges**: \n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(0, 8), (1, 9), (3, 6), (4, 8), (5, 7), (5, 9)]\n\n2. **Graph Structure**:\n   - The graph is sparse with only 6 edges.\n   - Each edge connects two vertices, and we need to ensure these connected vertices have different colors.\n\n3. **Color Assignment Strategy**:\n   - We have 3 colors available: [1, 2, 3].\n   - We will start coloring from vertex 0 and proceed to other vertices, ensuring no two connected vertices have the same color.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Coloring**:\n   - **Vertex 0**: Start with color 1.\n   - **Vertex 8**: Connected to vertex 0, so use a different color, say color 2.\n   - **Vertex 1**: Not connected to 0 or 8, can use color 1.\n   - **Vertex 9**: Connected to vertex 1, use a different color, say color 2.\n   - **Vertex 3**: Not connected to any colored vertex, can use color 1.\n   - **Vertex 6**: Connected to vertex 3, use a different color, say color 2.\n   - **Vertex 4**: Connected to vertex 8, use a different color, say color 1.\n   - **Vertex 5**: Not connected to any colored vertex, can use color 1.\n   - **Vertex 7**: Connected to vertex 5, use a different color, say color 2.\n\n5. **Final Check**:\n   - Ensure all connected vertices have different colors.\n   - Adjust colors if necessary to ensure no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\n6. **Final Coloring**:\n   - Vertex 0: Color 1\n   - Vertex 1: Color 1\n   - Vertex 2: Color 1 (not connected to any other vertex)\n   - Vertex 3: Color 1\n   - Vertex 4: Color 1\n   - Vertex 5: Color 1\n   - Vertex 6: Color 2\n   - Vertex 7: Color 2\n   - Vertex 8: Color 2\n   - Vertex 9: Color 2\n\nThe final coloring ensures that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nThe solution in JSON format is:\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 2, \"8\": 2, \"9\": 2}>>>"
