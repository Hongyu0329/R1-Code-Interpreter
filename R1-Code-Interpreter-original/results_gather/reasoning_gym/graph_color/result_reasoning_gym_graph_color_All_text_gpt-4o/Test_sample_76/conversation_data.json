    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have 10 vertices and 6 edges, and we can use up to 3 different colors.\n\nLet's analyze the graph step by step:\n\n1. **Vertices and Edges**: \n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(0, 2), (1, 4), (3, 4), (4, 7), (4, 8), (7, 8)]\n\n2. **Graph Structure**:\n   - Vertex 0 is connected to vertex 2.\n   - Vertex 1 is connected to vertex 4.\n   - Vertex 3 is connected to vertex 4.\n   - Vertex 4 is connected to vertices 1, 3, 7, and 8.\n   - Vertex 7 is connected to vertices 4 and 8.\n   - Vertex 8 is connected to vertices 4 and 7.\n\n3. **Color Assignment Strategy**:\n   - Start with vertex 0 and assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 2 is adjacent to vertex 0, so assign it a different color, say color 2.\n   - Vertex 1 is not adjacent to vertex 0 or 2, so it can be assigned color 1.\n   - Vertex 4 is adjacent to vertex 1, so assign it a different color, say color 2.\n   - Vertex 3 is adjacent to vertex 4, so assign it a different color, say color 1.\n   - Vertex 7 is adjacent to vertex 4, so assign it a different color, say color 3.\n   - Vertex 8 is adjacent to vertices 4 and 7, so it cannot be color 2 or 3. Assign it color 1.\n   - Vertices 5, 6, and 9 are not connected to any other vertices, so they can be assigned any color. Assign them color 1 for simplicity.\n\n4. **Final Color Assignment**:\n   - Vertex 0: Color 1\n   - Vertex 1: Color 1\n   - Vertex 2: Color 2\n   - Vertex 3: Color 1\n   - Vertex 4: Color 2\n   - Vertex 5: Color 1\n   - Vertex 6: Color 1\n   - Vertex 7: Color 3\n   - Vertex 8: Color 1\n   - Vertex 9: Color 1\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - Check each edge to ensure no two connected vertices share the same color:\n     - (0, 2): Colors 1 and 2\n     - (1, 4): Colors 1 and 2\n     - (3, 4): Colors 1 and 2\n     - (4, 7): Colors 2 and 3\n     - (4, 8): Colors 2 and 1\n     - (7, 8): Colors 3 and 1\n\nAll edges have vertices with different colors, so the coloring is valid.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 2, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 2, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 3, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 1}>>>"
