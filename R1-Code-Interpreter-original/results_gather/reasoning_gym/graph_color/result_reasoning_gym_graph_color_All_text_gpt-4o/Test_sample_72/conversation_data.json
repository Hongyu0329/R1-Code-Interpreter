    "To solve the problem of coloring the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color, we need to carefully analyze the given graph properties and constraints. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Graph Structure:**\n   - The graph has 10 vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].\n   - There are only two edges: (0, 7) and (5, 7).\n\n2. **Understand the Coloring Constraint:**\n   - We need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two vertices connected by an edge have the same color.\n   - The available colors are [1, 2, 3].\n\n3. **Analyze the Edges:**\n   - The edge (0, 7) means vertices 0 and 7 must have different colors.\n   - The edge (5, 7) means vertices 5 and 7 must have different colors.\n\n4. **Plan the Coloring:**\n   - Since vertex 7 is connected to both vertices 0 and 5, it must have a different color from both.\n   - We can start by assigning a color to vertex 7 and then choose different colors for vertices 0 and 5.\n\n5. **Assign Colors:**\n   - Assign color 1 to vertex 7.\n   - Assign color 2 to vertex 0 (different from vertex 7).\n   - Assign color 3 to vertex 5 (different from vertex 7).\n\n6. **Color the Remaining Vertices:**\n   - Vertices 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9 are not connected to any other vertices by the given edges, so they can be assigned any color. For simplicity, we can assign them all the same color, or distribute the colors evenly.\n\n7. **Final Coloring:**\n   - Assign color 1 to vertices 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9.\n\n8. **Verify the Solution:**\n   - Ensure that no two connected vertices share the same color:\n     - Vertex 0 (color 2) and vertex 7 (color 1) are different.\n     - Vertex 5 (color 3) and vertex 7 (color 1) are different.\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that the graph is properly colored according to the given constraints.\n\nThe final coloring solution is:\n<<<{\"0\": 2, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 3, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 1}>>>"
