    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have 10 vertices and 4 edges, and we can use 3 different colors. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the vertices and edges**: \n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(0, 3), (0, 8), (2, 5), (4, 6)]\n\n2. **Understand the constraints**:\n   - Each vertex must be colored such that no two vertices connected by an edge have the same color.\n   - We have 3 colors available: [1, 2, 3].\n\n3. **Plan the coloring**:\n   - Start by coloring the vertices connected by edges, as these have constraints.\n   - Use a greedy approach to assign colors, ensuring no two connected vertices share the same color.\n\n4. **Color the vertices**:\n   - Start with vertex 0. Assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 0 is connected to vertices 3 and 8. Assign vertex 3 color 2 and vertex 8 color 3.\n   - Vertex 2 is not connected to vertex 0, 3, or 8, so assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 2 is connected to vertex 5. Assign vertex 5 color 2.\n   - Vertex 4 is not connected to any of the previously colored vertices, so assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 4 is connected to vertex 6. Assign vertex 6 color 2.\n   - Vertices 1, 7, and 9 are not connected to any other vertices, so they can be assigned any color. Assign them color 1.\n\n5. **Verify the coloring**:\n   - Check each edge to ensure no two connected vertices have the same color:\n     - Edge (0, 3): Colors are 1 and 2.\n     - Edge (0, 8): Colors are 1 and 3.\n     - Edge (2, 5): Colors are 1 and 2.\n     - Edge (4, 6): Colors are 1 and 2.\n   - All constraints are satisfied.\n\n6. **Prepare the final answer**:\n   - Create a JSON map of vertices to colors.\n\nThe final coloring of the graph is:\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 2, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 2, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 3, \"9\": 1}>>>"
