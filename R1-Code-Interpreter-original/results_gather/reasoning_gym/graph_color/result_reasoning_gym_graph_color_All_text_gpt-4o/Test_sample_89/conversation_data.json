    "To solve the problem of coloring the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Graph Structure**: \n   - We have 10 vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n   - The edges are: (1, 2), (3, 9), (6, 8). This means:\n     - Vertex 1 is connected to vertex 2.\n     - Vertex 3 is connected to vertex 9.\n     - Vertex 6 is connected to vertex 8.\n\n2. **Identify the Coloring Constraint**:\n   - We need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two vertices connected by an edge have the same color.\n   - We have three possible colors: 1, 2, and 3.\n\n3. **Plan the Coloring**:\n   - Start by coloring the vertices connected by edges, as these have constraints.\n   - For each pair of connected vertices, assign different colors.\n\n4. **Assign Colors**:\n   - For edge (1, 2): Assign color 1 to vertex 1 and color 2 to vertex 2.\n   - For edge (3, 9): Assign color 1 to vertex 3 and color 2 to vertex 9.\n   - For edge (6, 8): Assign color 1 to vertex 6 and color 2 to vertex 8.\n\n5. **Color Remaining Vertices**:\n   - Vertices 0, 4, 5, and 7 are not connected to any other vertices by edges, so they can be assigned any color. To keep it simple, assign color 1 to these vertices.\n\n6. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - Ensure that no two connected vertices share the same color. \n   - Check that all vertices are assigned a color.\n\n7. **Output the Solution**:\n   - Create a JSON map of vertices to colors.\n\nFollowing these steps, the coloring of the graph is:\n\n- Vertex 0: Color 1\n- Vertex 1: Color 1\n- Vertex 2: Color 2\n- Vertex 3: Color 1\n- Vertex 4: Color 1\n- Vertex 5: Color 1\n- Vertex 6: Color 1\n- Vertex 7: Color 1\n- Vertex 8: Color 2\n- Vertex 9: Color 2\n\nThe final JSON map of vertices to colors is:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 2, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 2, \"9\": 2}>>>"
