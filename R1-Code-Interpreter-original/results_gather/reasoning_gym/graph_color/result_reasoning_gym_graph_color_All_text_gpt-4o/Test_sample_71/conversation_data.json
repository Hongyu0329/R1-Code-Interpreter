    "To solve the problem of coloring the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Graph Structure**: \n   - We have 10 vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n   - The edges are: (1, 7), (3, 7), (6, 9). This means:\n     - Vertex 1 is connected to vertex 7.\n     - Vertex 3 is connected to vertex 7.\n     - Vertex 6 is connected to vertex 9.\n\n2. **Identify the Constraints**:\n   - Vertices connected by an edge must not share the same color.\n   - We have three colors available: 1, 2, and 3.\n\n3. **Plan the Coloring**:\n   - Start by coloring the vertices with the most connections first, to minimize conflicts later.\n   - Since vertex 7 is connected to both 1 and 3, it is a good candidate to start with.\n\n4. **Color the Graph**:\n   - Assign a color to vertex 7. Let's choose color 1 for vertex 7.\n   - Vertex 1, connected to vertex 7, cannot be color 1. Assign color 2 to vertex 1.\n   - Vertex 3, also connected to vertex 7, cannot be color 1. Assign color 2 to vertex 3.\n   - Vertex 6 is connected to vertex 9. Assign color 1 to vertex 6.\n   - Vertex 9, connected to vertex 6, cannot be color 1. Assign color 2 to vertex 9.\n   - The remaining vertices (0, 2, 4, 5, 8) are not connected to any other vertices, so they can be any color. Assign color 1 to these vertices for simplicity.\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - Check that no two connected vertices share the same color:\n     - (1, 7): Colors are 2 and 1, respectively.\n     - (3, 7): Colors are 2 and 1, respectively.\n     - (6, 9): Colors are 1 and 2, respectively.\n   - All constraints are satisfied.\n\n6. **Output the Solution**:\n   - Create a JSON map of vertices to colors.\n\nThe final coloring of the graph is:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 2, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 2, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 2}>>>"
