    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have 10 vertices and 2 edges, and we can use 3 different colors. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the vertices and edges**: \n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(0, 6), (1, 2)]\n\n2. **Understand the constraints**:\n   - Vertices connected by an edge must have different colors.\n   - We have three colors available: [1, 2, 3].\n\n3. **Assign colors to vertices**:\n   - Start with the vertices connected by edges, as they have constraints:\n     - For edge (0, 6), assign different colors to vertices 0 and 6. Let's assign color 1 to vertex 0 and color 2 to vertex 6.\n     - For edge (1, 2), assign different colors to vertices 1 and 2. Let's assign color 1 to vertex 1 and color 2 to vertex 2.\n\n4. **Assign colors to the remaining vertices**:\n   - Vertices 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 are not connected by any edges, so they can be assigned any color. We can assign color 1 to all of them for simplicity.\n\n5. **Verify the solution**:\n   - Ensure that no two connected vertices have the same color:\n     - Vertex 0 (color 1) and vertex 6 (color 2) are correctly colored.\n     - Vertex 1 (color 1) and vertex 2 (color 2) are correctly colored.\n   - All other vertices are not connected by edges, so their colors do not matter in terms of adjacency.\n\n6. **Create the JSON map**:\n   - Construct a JSON map of vertices to their assigned colors.\n\nThe final coloring solution is:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 2, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 1}>>>"
