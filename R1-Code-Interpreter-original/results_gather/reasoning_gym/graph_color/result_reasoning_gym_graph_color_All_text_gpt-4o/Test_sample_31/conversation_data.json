    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have three colors available: 1, 2, and 3. Let's analyze the graph step by step:\n\n1. **Vertices and Edges**: \n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(0, 6), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 8), (4, 8), (5, 7), (6, 7), (6, 8), (6, 9)]\n\n2. **Graph Structure**:\n   - Vertex 0 is connected to 6.\n   - Vertex 1 is connected to 4.\n   - Vertex 2 is connected to 3 and 4.\n   - Vertex 3 is connected to 2 and 8.\n   - Vertex 4 is connected to 1, 2, and 8.\n   - Vertex 5 is connected to 7.\n   - Vertex 6 is connected to 0, 7, 8, and 9.\n   - Vertex 7 is connected to 5 and 6.\n   - Vertex 8 is connected to 3, 4, and 6.\n   - Vertex 9 is connected to 6.\n\n3. **Coloring Strategy**:\n   - Start with vertex 0 and assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 6 is adjacent to 0, so assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 7 is adjacent to 6, so assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 5 is adjacent to 7, so assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 9 is adjacent to 6, so assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 8 is adjacent to 6, so assign it color 3.\n   - Vertex 3 is adjacent to 8, so assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 2 is adjacent to 3, so assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 4 is adjacent to 2 and 8, so assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 1 is adjacent to 4, so assign it color 2.\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   - Check each edge to ensure no two connected vertices have the same color:\n     - (0, 6): Colors 1 and 2\n     - (1, 4): Colors 2 and 1\n     - (2, 3): Colors 2 and 1\n     - (2, 4): Colors 2 and 1\n     - (3, 8): Colors 1 and 3\n     - (4, 8): Colors 1 and 3\n     - (5, 7): Colors 2 and 1\n     - (6, 7): Colors 2 and 1\n     - (6, 8): Colors 2 and 3\n     - (6, 9): Colors 2 and 1\n\nAll edges have different colors for their vertices, so the coloring is valid.\n\n5. **Final Coloring**:\n   - Vertex 0: Color 1\n   - Vertex 1: Color 2\n   - Vertex 2: Color 2\n   - Vertex 3: Color 1\n   - Vertex 4: Color 1\n   - Vertex 5: Color 2\n   - Vertex 6: Color 2\n   - Vertex 7: Color 1\n   - Vertex 8: Color 3\n   - Vertex 9: Color 1\n\nThe final answer in JSON format is:\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 2, \"2\": 2, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 2, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 3, \"9\": 1}>>>"
