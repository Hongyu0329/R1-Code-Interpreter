    "To solve the problem of coloring the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color, we need to carefully analyze the given graph properties and constraints. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Graph Structure:**\n   - The graph has 10 vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].\n   - The graph has 2 edges: [(5, 6), (7, 9)].\n   - This means that vertex 5 is connected to vertex 6, and vertex 7 is connected to vertex 9. All other vertices are isolated and have no connections.\n\n2. **Understand the Coloring Constraint:**\n   - We need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two connected vertices have the same color.\n   - We have 3 possible colors to use: [1, 2, 3].\n\n3. **Plan the Coloring:**\n   - Since vertices 5 and 6 are connected, they must have different colors. We can assign color 1 to vertex 5 and color 2 to vertex 6.\n   - Similarly, vertices 7 and 9 are connected, so they must also have different colors. We can assign color 1 to vertex 7 and color 2 to vertex 9.\n   - The remaining vertices [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8] are not connected to any other vertices, so they can be assigned any of the available colors. For simplicity, we can assign color 1 to all of them.\n\n4. **Assign Colors:**\n   - Vertex 0: Color 1\n   - Vertex 1: Color 1\n   - Vertex 2: Color 1\n   - Vertex 3: Color 1\n   - Vertex 4: Color 1\n   - Vertex 5: Color 1\n   - Vertex 6: Color 2\n   - Vertex 7: Color 1\n   - Vertex 8: Color 1\n   - Vertex 9: Color 2\n\n5. **Verify the Solution:**\n   - Check that no two connected vertices have the same color:\n     - Edge (5, 6): Vertex 5 has color 1, vertex 6 has color 2 (different colors).\n     - Edge (7, 9): Vertex 7 has color 1, vertex 9 has color 2 (different colors).\n   - All constraints are satisfied.\n\n6. **Output the Solution:**\n   - Format the solution as a JSON map of vertices to colors.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 2}>>>"
