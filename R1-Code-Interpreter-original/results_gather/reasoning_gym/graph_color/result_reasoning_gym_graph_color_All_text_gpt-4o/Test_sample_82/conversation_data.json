    "To solve the problem of coloring the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color, we need to carefully analyze the given graph properties and constraints. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Graph Structure:**\n   - The graph has 10 vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].\n   - There are only two edges: (0, 5) and (1, 7).\n\n2. **Understand the Coloring Constraint:**\n   - We need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two vertices connected by an edge have the same color.\n   - The available colors are [1, 2, 3].\n\n3. **Analyze the Edges:**\n   - Edge (0, 5): Vertices 0 and 5 must have different colors.\n   - Edge (1, 7): Vertices 1 and 7 must have different colors.\n\n4. **Assign Colors:**\n   - Since there are only two edges, we can start by assigning colors to the vertices involved in these edges.\n   - Assign color 1 to vertex 0 and color 2 to vertex 5 to satisfy the edge (0, 5).\n   - Assign color 1 to vertex 1 and color 2 to vertex 7 to satisfy the edge (1, 7).\n\n5. **Color the Remaining Vertices:**\n   - Vertices 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9 are not connected by any edges, so they can be assigned any of the available colors.\n   - For simplicity, we can assign color 1 to all these vertices.\n\n6. **Verify the Solution:**\n   - Ensure that no two connected vertices share the same color:\n     - For edge (0, 5), vertex 0 is color 1 and vertex 5 is color 2.\n     - For edge (1, 7), vertex 1 is color 1 and vertex 7 is color 2.\n   - All other vertices are not connected by any edges, so their colors do not affect the solution.\n\n7. **Construct the JSON Map:**\n   - Create a JSON map of vertices to their assigned colors.\n\nThe final coloring solution is:\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 2, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 2, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 1}>>>"
