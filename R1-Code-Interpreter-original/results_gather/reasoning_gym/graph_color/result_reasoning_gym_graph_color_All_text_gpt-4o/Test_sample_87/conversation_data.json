    "To solve the problem of coloring the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Graph Structure**: \n   - We have 10 vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n   - The edges are: (0, 7), (2, 7), (4, 9). This means:\n     - Vertex 0 is connected to vertex 7.\n     - Vertex 2 is connected to vertex 7.\n     - Vertex 4 is connected to vertex 9.\n\n2. **Identify the Coloring Constraint**:\n   - We need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two connected vertices have the same color.\n   - We have three possible colors: 1, 2, and 3.\n\n3. **Plan the Coloring**:\n   - Start by coloring the vertices involved in the edges, as they have constraints.\n   - For edge (0, 7), assign different colors to 0 and 7.\n   - For edge (2, 7), ensure 2 has a different color from 7.\n   - For edge (4, 9), assign different colors to 4 and 9.\n\n4. **Assign Colors**:\n   - Assign color 1 to vertex 0.\n   - Assign color 2 to vertex 7 (different from 0).\n   - Assign color 1 to vertex 2 (different from 7).\n   - Assign color 1 to vertex 4.\n   - Assign color 2 to vertex 9 (different from 4).\n\n5. **Color Remaining Vertices**:\n   - Vertices 1, 3, 5, 6, and 8 are not connected to any other vertices, so they can be assigned any color. For simplicity, assign them color 1.\n\n6. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - Check that no two connected vertices share the same color:\n     - (0, 7): 0 is color 1, 7 is color 2.\n     - (2, 7): 2 is color 1, 7 is color 2.\n     - (4, 9): 4 is color 1, 9 is color 2.\n   - All constraints are satisfied.\n\n7. **Prepare the JSON Map**:\n   - Create a JSON map of vertices to their assigned colors.\n\nThe final coloring solution is:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 2, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 2}>>>"
