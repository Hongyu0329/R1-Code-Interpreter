    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have three colors available: 1, 2, and 3. The graph has 10 vertices and 3 edges, which means it is relatively sparse. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the vertices and edges:**\n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(0, 3), (1, 2), (3, 4)]\n\n2. **Understand the constraints:**\n   - Vertices connected by an edge must have different colors.\n   - We have three colors to use: 1, 2, and 3.\n\n3. **Plan the coloring:**\n   - Start with vertex 0. Assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 0 is connected to vertex 3. Assign vertex 3 a different color, say color 2.\n   - Vertex 3 is connected to vertex 4. Assign vertex 4 a different color from vertex 3, say color 1.\n   - Vertex 1 is connected to vertex 2. Assign vertex 1 color 1 and vertex 2 a different color, say color 2.\n   - Vertices 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 are not connected to any other vertices, so they can be assigned any color. For simplicity, assign them color 1.\n\n4. **Verify the coloring:**\n   - Check each edge to ensure no two connected vertices share the same color:\n     - Edge (0, 3): Vertex 0 is color 1, vertex 3 is color 2. Different colors.\n     - Edge (1, 2): Vertex 1 is color 1, vertex 2 is color 2. Different colors.\n     - Edge (3, 4): Vertex 3 is color 2, vertex 4 is color 1. Different colors.\n\n5. **Construct the JSON map:**\n   - Assign the colors to each vertex as planned.\n\nThe final coloring solution is:\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 2, \"3\": 2, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 1}>>>"
