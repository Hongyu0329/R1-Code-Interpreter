    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have 10 vertices and 6 edges, and we can use up to 3 different colors.\n\nLet's analyze the graph step by step:\n\n1. **Vertices and Edges**: \n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(0, 5), (2, 3), (4, 5), (4, 6), (6, 7), (6, 8)]\n\n2. **Graph Structure**:\n   - Vertex 0 is connected to vertex 5.\n   - Vertex 2 is connected to vertex 3.\n   - Vertex 4 is connected to vertices 5 and 6.\n   - Vertex 6 is connected to vertices 4, 7, and 8.\n\n3. **Color Assignment**:\n   - Start with vertex 0 and assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 5 is adjacent to vertex 0, so assign it a different color, say color 2.\n   - Vertex 2 can be assigned color 1.\n   - Vertex 3 is adjacent to vertex 2, so assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 4 can be assigned color 1.\n   - Vertex 6 is adjacent to vertex 4, so assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 7 is adjacent to vertex 6, so assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 8 is adjacent to vertex 6, so assign it color 1.\n   - Vertices 1 and 9 are isolated (not connected to any other vertices), so they can be assigned any color. Assign them color 1.\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   - Check each edge to ensure no two connected vertices have the same color:\n     - (0, 5): Colors are 1 and 2.\n     - (2, 3): Colors are 1 and 2.\n     - (4, 5): Colors are 1 and 2.\n     - (4, 6): Colors are 1 and 2.\n     - (6, 7): Colors are 2 and 1.\n     - (6, 8): Colors are 2 and 1.\n   - All edges have vertices with different colors, so the coloring is valid.\n\n5. **Final Coloring**:\n   - Vertex 0: Color 1\n   - Vertex 1: Color 1\n   - Vertex 2: Color 1\n   - Vertex 3: Color 2\n   - Vertex 4: Color 1\n   - Vertex 5: Color 2\n   - Vertex 6: Color 2\n   - Vertex 7: Color 1\n   - Vertex 8: Color 1\n   - Vertex 9: Color 1\n\nThe final solution is:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 2, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 2, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 1}>>>"
