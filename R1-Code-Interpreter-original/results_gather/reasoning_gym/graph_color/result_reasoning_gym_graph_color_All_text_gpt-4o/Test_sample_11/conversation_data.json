    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have 10 vertices and 6 edges, and we can use up to 3 different colors.\n\nLet's analyze the graph step by step:\n\n1. **Vertices and Edges**: \n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(0, 6), (1, 8), (3, 6), (3, 9), (4, 7), (5, 9)]\n\n2. **Graph Structure**:\n   - Vertex 0 is connected to vertex 6.\n   - Vertex 1 is connected to vertex 8.\n   - Vertex 3 is connected to vertices 6 and 9.\n   - Vertex 4 is connected to vertex 7.\n   - Vertex 5 is connected to vertex 9.\n\n3. **Color Assignment Strategy**:\n   - We will start by coloring the vertices with the least number of connections first, as they have fewer constraints.\n   - We will use colors 1, 2, and 3.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Coloring**:\n   - **Vertex 0**: Can be colored with color 1.\n   - **Vertex 6**: Connected to vertex 0, so it cannot be color 1. Use color 2.\n   - **Vertex 1**: Can be colored with color 1.\n   - **Vertex 8**: Connected to vertex 1, so it cannot be color 1. Use color 2.\n   - **Vertex 3**: Can be colored with color 1.\n   - **Vertex 9**: Connected to vertex 3, so it cannot be color 1. Use color 2.\n   - **Vertex 4**: Can be colored with color 1.\n   - **Vertex 7**: Connected to vertex 4, so it cannot be color 1. Use color 2.\n   - **Vertex 5**: Can be colored with color 1.\n\n5. **Final Check**:\n   - Ensure no two connected vertices share the same color.\n   - All edges are satisfied with different colors on connected vertices.\n\n6. **Result**:\n   - The coloring is valid with the given constraints.\n\nThe final coloring of the graph is as follows:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 2, \"8\": 2, \"9\": 2}>>>"
