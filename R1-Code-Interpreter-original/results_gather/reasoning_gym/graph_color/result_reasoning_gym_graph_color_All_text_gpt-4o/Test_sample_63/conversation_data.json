    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have 10 vertices and 6 edges, and we can use up to 3 different colors.\n\nLet's analyze the graph step by step:\n\n1. **Vertices and Edges**: \n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(0, 2), (0, 7), (2, 8), (3, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8)]\n\n2. **Coloring Strategy**:\n   - We will start coloring from vertex 0 and proceed to other vertices, ensuring no two connected vertices have the same color.\n   - We have 3 colors available: [1, 2, 3].\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Coloring**:\n   - **Vertex 0**: Start with color 1.\n   - **Vertex 2**: Connected to 0, so use color 2.\n   - **Vertex 7**: Connected to 0, so use color 2.\n   - **Vertex 8**: Connected to 2, so use color 1.\n   - **Vertex 3**: Not connected to any colored vertex yet, so use color 1.\n   - **Vertex 6**: Connected to 3, so use color 2.\n   - **Vertex 5**: Not connected to any colored vertex yet, so use color 1.\n   - **Vertex 1**: Not connected to any colored vertex yet, so use color 1.\n   - **Vertex 4**: Not connected to any colored vertex yet, so use color 1.\n   - **Vertex 9**: Not connected to any colored vertex yet, so use color 1.\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   - Check each edge to ensure no two connected vertices have the same color:\n     - (0, 2): Colors are 1 and 2.\n     - (0, 7): Colors are 1 and 2.\n     - (2, 8): Colors are 2 and 1.\n     - (3, 6): Colors are 1 and 2.\n     - (5, 7): Colors are 1 and 2.\n     - (5, 8): Colors are 1 and 1 (this is incorrect, so we need to adjust).\n\n5. **Adjustments**:\n   - Since vertex 5 and vertex 8 both have color 1 and are connected, we need to change the color of vertex 5 to 3.\n\n6. **Final Coloring**:\n   - Vertex 0: Color 1\n   - Vertex 1: Color 1\n   - Vertex 2: Color 2\n   - Vertex 3: Color 1\n   - Vertex 4: Color 1\n   - Vertex 5: Color 3\n   - Vertex 6: Color 2\n   - Vertex 7: Color 2\n   - Vertex 8: Color 1\n   - Vertex 9: Color 1\n\nThe final coloring ensures no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nThe solution in JSON format is:\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 2, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 3, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 2, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 1}>>>"
