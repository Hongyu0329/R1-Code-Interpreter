    "To solve the problem of coloring the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Graph Structure**: \n   - We have 10 vertices labeled from 0 to 9.\n   - There are only two edges: (5, 7) and (5, 9).\n   - This means vertex 5 is connected to vertices 7 and 9, while vertices 7 and 9 are not directly connected to each other.\n\n2. **Identify the Coloring Constraints**:\n   - Vertices 5 and 7 must have different colors.\n   - Vertices 5 and 9 must have different colors.\n   - Vertices 7 and 9 can have the same color since they are not directly connected.\n\n3. **Choose Colors for the Vertices**:\n   - We have three possible colors: 1, 2, and 3.\n   - Assign color 1 to vertex 5.\n   - Assign color 2 to vertex 7 (different from vertex 5).\n   - Assign color 3 to vertex 9 (different from vertex 5).\n\n4. **Assign Colors to Remaining Vertices**:\n   - Vertices 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 are not connected to any other vertices, so they can be assigned any color.\n   - For simplicity, assign color 1 to all these vertices.\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - Ensure that no two connected vertices share the same color:\n     - Vertex 5 (color 1) is connected to vertex 7 (color 2) and vertex 9 (color 3), satisfying the condition.\n     - Vertices 7 and 9 are not connected, so their colors do not matter in relation to each other.\n\n6. **Prepare the JSON Map**:\n   - Create a JSON map of vertices to their assigned colors.\n\nFollowing these steps, the coloring of the graph is as follows:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 2, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 3}>>>"
