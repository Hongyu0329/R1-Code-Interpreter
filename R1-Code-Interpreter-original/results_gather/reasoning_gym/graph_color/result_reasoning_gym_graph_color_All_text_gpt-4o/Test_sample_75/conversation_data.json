    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have 10 vertices and 6 edges, and we can use up to 3 different colors.\n\nLet's analyze the graph step by step:\n\n1. **Vertices and Edges**: \n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(1, 3), (2, 8), (3, 5), (3, 9), (4, 9), (6, 9)]\n\n2. **Graph Structure**:\n   - Vertex 1 is connected to vertex 3.\n   - Vertex 2 is connected to vertex 8.\n   - Vertex 3 is connected to vertices 1, 5, and 9.\n   - Vertex 4 is connected to vertex 9.\n   - Vertex 5 is connected to vertex 3.\n   - Vertex 6 is connected to vertex 9.\n   - Vertex 8 is connected to vertex 2.\n   - Vertex 9 is connected to vertices 3, 4, and 6.\n\n3. **Color Assignment Strategy**:\n   - We will start by coloring the vertices with the highest degree (most connections) first, as they have the most constraints.\n   - Vertex 3 has the highest degree (3 connections), so we start with it.\n\n4. **Coloring Steps**:\n   - **Vertex 3**: Assign color 1.\n   - **Vertex 1**: Connected to vertex 3, assign color 2.\n   - **Vertex 5**: Connected to vertex 3, assign color 2.\n   - **Vertex 9**: Connected to vertex 3, assign color 2.\n   - **Vertex 4**: Connected to vertex 9, assign color 1.\n   - **Vertex 6**: Connected to vertex 9, assign color 1.\n   - **Vertex 2**: Not connected to any colored vertex yet, assign color 1.\n   - **Vertex 8**: Connected to vertex 2, assign color 2.\n   - **Vertex 0**: Not connected to any other vertex, assign color 1.\n   - **Vertex 7**: Not connected to any other vertex, assign color 1.\n\n5. **Final Coloring**:\n   - Vertex 0: Color 1\n   - Vertex 1: Color 2\n   - Vertex 2: Color 1\n   - Vertex 3: Color 1\n   - Vertex 4: Color 1\n   - Vertex 5: Color 2\n   - Vertex 6: Color 1\n   - Vertex 7: Color 1\n   - Vertex 8: Color 2\n   - Vertex 9: Color 2\n\nThe final coloring ensures that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nThe solution in JSON format is:\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 2, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 2, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 2, \"9\": 2}>>>"
