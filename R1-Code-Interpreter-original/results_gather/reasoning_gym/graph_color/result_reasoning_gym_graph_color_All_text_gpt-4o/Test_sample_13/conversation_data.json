    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have 10 vertices and 5 edges, and we can use 3 colors: 1, 2, and 3.\n\nLet's analyze the graph step by step:\n\n1. **Vertices and Edges**: \n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(0, 4), (1, 4), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 7)]\n\n2. **Graph Structure**:\n   - Vertex 0 is connected to vertex 4.\n   - Vertex 1 is connected to vertex 4.\n   - Vertex 2 is connected to vertices 6 and 7.\n   - Vertex 3 is connected to vertex 7.\n   - Vertices 5, 8, and 9 are isolated (no edges).\n\n3. **Coloring Strategy**:\n   - Start with vertex 0 and assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 4 is adjacent to vertex 0, so it cannot be color 1. Assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 1 is adjacent to vertex 4, so it cannot be color 2. Assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 2 is not adjacent to any colored vertex yet, so assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 6 is adjacent to vertex 2, so it cannot be color 1. Assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 7 is adjacent to vertex 2, so it cannot be color 1. Assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 3 is adjacent to vertex 7, so it cannot be color 2. Assign it color 1.\n   - Vertices 5, 8, and 9 are isolated, so they can be any color. Assign them color 1.\n\n4. **Final Coloring**:\n   - Vertex 0: Color 1\n   - Vertex 1: Color 1\n   - Vertex 2: Color 1\n   - Vertex 3: Color 1\n   - Vertex 4: Color 2\n   - Vertex 5: Color 1\n   - Vertex 6: Color 2\n   - Vertex 7: Color 2\n   - Vertex 8: Color 1\n   - Vertex 9: Color 1\n\nThe coloring ensures that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 2, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 2, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 1}>>>"
