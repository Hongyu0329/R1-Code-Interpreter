    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have 10 vertices and 4 edges, and we can use 3 different colors. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the vertices and edges:**\n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(0, 3), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5)]\n\n2. **Understand the constraints:**\n   - Vertices connected by an edge must have different colors.\n   - We have 3 colors available: [1, 2, 3].\n\n3. **Plan the coloring:**\n   - Start with vertex 0. Assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 3 is connected to vertex 0, so it cannot be color 1. Assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 5 is connected to vertex 3, so it cannot be color 2. Assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 2 is connected to vertex 5, so it cannot be color 1. Assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 4 is connected to vertex 5, so it cannot be color 1. Assign it color 2.\n   - Vertices 1, 6, 7, 8, and 9 are not connected to any other vertices in the given edges, so they can be assigned any color. Assign them color 1 for simplicity.\n\n4. **Verify the coloring:**\n   - Check each edge to ensure no two connected vertices share the same color:\n     - Edge (0, 3): Vertex 0 is color 1, vertex 3 is color 2. Different colors.\n     - Edge (2, 5): Vertex 2 is color 2, vertex 5 is color 1. Different colors.\n     - Edge (3, 5): Vertex 3 is color 2, vertex 5 is color 1. Different colors.\n     - Edge (4, 5): Vertex 4 is color 2, vertex 5 is color 1. Different colors.\n\n5. **Construct the JSON map:**\n   - Assign the colors to each vertex as determined.\n\nThe final coloring solution is:\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 2, \"3\": 2, \"4\": 2, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 1}>>>"
