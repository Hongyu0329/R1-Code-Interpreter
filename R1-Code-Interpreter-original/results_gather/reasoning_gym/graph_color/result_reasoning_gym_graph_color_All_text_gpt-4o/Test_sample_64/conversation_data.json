    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have 10 vertices and 4 edges, and we can use up to 3 different colors.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the vertices and edges:**\n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 2), (3, 9)]\n\n2. **Understand the constraints:**\n   - Each vertex must be colored such that no two vertices connected by an edge have the same color.\n   - We have 3 colors available: [1, 2, 3].\n\n3. **Plan the coloring:**\n   - Start with vertex 0. Assign it the first color, say color 1.\n   - Vertex 0 is connected to vertices 4 and 6. Assign a different color to these vertices, say color 2.\n   - Vertex 1 is not connected to vertex 0, so it can also be assigned color 1.\n   - Vertex 1 is connected to vertex 2, so assign vertex 2 a different color, say color 2.\n   - Vertex 3 is not connected to any of the previously colored vertices, so it can be assigned color 1.\n   - Vertex 3 is connected to vertex 9, so assign vertex 9 a different color, say color 2.\n   - Vertices 5, 7, and 8 are not connected to any other vertices, so they can be assigned any color. For simplicity, assign them color 1.\n\n4. **Verify the coloring:**\n   - Check each edge to ensure no two connected vertices share the same color:\n     - Edge (0, 4): Colors are 1 and 2.\n     - Edge (0, 6): Colors are 1 and 2.\n     - Edge (1, 2): Colors are 1 and 2.\n     - Edge (3, 9): Colors are 1 and 2.\n   - All edges satisfy the coloring condition.\n\n5. **Construct the JSON map:**\n   - Assign the colors to each vertex as determined.\n\nThe final coloring solution is:\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 2, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 2, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 2}>>>"
