    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have 10 vertices and 3 possible colors. The edges given are (0, 4), (0, 8), and (3, 6). Let's proceed step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the vertices and edges**: \n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(0, 4), (0, 8), (3, 6)]\n\n2. **Understand the constraints**:\n   - Vertices 0 and 4 must have different colors.\n   - Vertices 0 and 8 must have different colors.\n   - Vertices 3 and 6 must have different colors.\n\n3. **Assign colors to vertices**:\n   - Start with vertex 0. Assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 4 is connected to vertex 0, so it cannot be color 1. Assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 8 is also connected to vertex 0, so it cannot be color 1. Assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 3 is not connected to 0, 4, or 8, so it can be color 1.\n   - Vertex 6 is connected to vertex 3, so it cannot be color 1. Assign it color 2.\n   - Vertices 1, 2, 5, 7, and 9 are not connected to any other vertices, so they can be any color. Assign them color 1 for simplicity.\n\n4. **Verify the coloring**:\n   - Check each edge to ensure no two connected vertices share the same color:\n     - Edge (0, 4): Colors are 1 and 2, different.\n     - Edge (0, 8): Colors are 1 and 2, different.\n     - Edge (3, 6): Colors are 1 and 2, different.\n\n5. **Construct the JSON map**:\n   - Create a JSON map of vertices to their assigned colors.\n\nThe final coloring solution is:\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 2, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 2, \"9\": 1}>>>"
