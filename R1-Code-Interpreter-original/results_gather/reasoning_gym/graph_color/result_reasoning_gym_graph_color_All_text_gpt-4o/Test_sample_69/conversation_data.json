    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have 10 vertices and 4 edges, and we can use 3 different colors. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the vertices and edges:**\n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(0, 4), (2, 6), (4, 5), (5, 6)]\n\n2. **Understand the constraints:**\n   - Each vertex must be colored such that no two connected vertices (i.e., vertices that share an edge) have the same color.\n\n3. **List the possible colors:**\n   - Colors: [1, 2, 3]\n\n4. **Plan the coloring:**\n   - Start with vertex 0 and assign it a color.\n   - Move to vertex 4 (connected to 0) and assign it a different color.\n   - Continue this process for each vertex, ensuring no two connected vertices share the same color.\n\n5. **Color the vertices:**\n   - Vertex 0: Assign color 1.\n   - Vertex 4 (connected to 0): Assign color 2.\n   - Vertex 5 (connected to 4): Assign color 1 (since 4 is color 2).\n   - Vertex 6 (connected to 5): Assign color 2 (since 5 is color 1).\n   - Vertex 2 (connected to 6): Assign color 1 (since 6 is color 2).\n\n6. **Color the remaining vertices:**\n   - Vertices 1, 3, 7, 8, and 9 are not connected to any other vertices in the given edges, so they can be assigned any color. For simplicity, assign them color 1.\n\n7. **Verify the solution:**\n   - Check each edge to ensure no two connected vertices have the same color:\n     - Edge (0, 4): Colors are 1 and 2.\n     - Edge (2, 6): Colors are 1 and 2.\n     - Edge (4, 5): Colors are 2 and 1.\n     - Edge (5, 6): Colors are 1 and 2.\n   - All constraints are satisfied.\n\n8. **Prepare the JSON map:**\n   - Create a JSON map of vertices to their assigned colors.\n\nThe final coloring solution is:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 2, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 1}>>>"
