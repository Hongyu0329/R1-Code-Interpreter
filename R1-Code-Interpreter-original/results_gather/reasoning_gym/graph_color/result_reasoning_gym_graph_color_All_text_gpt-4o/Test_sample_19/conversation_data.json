    "To solve the problem of coloring the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Graph Structure**: \n   - We have 10 vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n   - The edges are: (1, 9), (2, 5), (3, 9), (4, 7), (4, 8).\n   - This means vertex 1 is connected to vertex 9, vertex 2 is connected to vertex 5, and so on.\n\n2. **Identify the Degree of Each Vertex**:\n   - Degree is the number of edges connected to a vertex.\n   - Vertex 1: degree 1 (connected to 9)\n   - Vertex 2: degree 1 (connected to 5)\n   - Vertex 3: degree 1 (connected to 9)\n   - Vertex 4: degree 2 (connected to 7 and 8)\n   - Vertex 5: degree 1 (connected to 2)\n   - Vertex 6: degree 0 (no connections)\n   - Vertex 7: degree 1 (connected to 4)\n   - Vertex 8: degree 1 (connected to 4)\n   - Vertex 9: degree 2 (connected to 1 and 3)\n\n3. **Choose a Coloring Strategy**:\n   - We have 3 colors available: 1, 2, 3.\n   - Start by coloring vertices with the highest degree to minimize conflicts.\n\n4. **Color the Graph**:\n   - Start with vertex 4 (degree 2), color it with color 1.\n   - Vertex 7 (connected to 4), color it with color 2.\n   - Vertex 8 (connected to 4), color it with color 2.\n   - Vertex 9 (degree 2), color it with color 1.\n   - Vertex 1 (connected to 9), color it with color 2.\n   - Vertex 3 (connected to 9), color it with color 2.\n   - Vertex 2 (degree 1), color it with color 1.\n   - Vertex 5 (connected to 2), color it with color 2.\n   - Vertex 6 (degree 0), can be any color, choose color 1.\n\n5. **Verify the Coloring**:\n   - Ensure no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n   - Check each edge to confirm the colors are different.\n\n6. **Output the Solution**:\n   - Create a JSON map of vertices to colors.\n\nThe final coloring of the graph is:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 2, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 2, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 2, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 2, \"8\": 2, \"9\": 1}>>>"
