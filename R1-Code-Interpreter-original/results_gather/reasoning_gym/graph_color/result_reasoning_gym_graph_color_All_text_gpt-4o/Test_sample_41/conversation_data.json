    "To solve the problem of coloring the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Graph Structure**: \n   - We have 10 vertices: 0 through 9.\n   - The edges are: (0, 5), (0, 9), (1, 9), (2, 7), (3, 6), (5, 7).\n   - This means vertex 0 is connected to vertices 5 and 9, vertex 1 is connected to vertex 9, and so on.\n\n2. **Identify Constraints**:\n   - Each vertex must be colored such that no two connected vertices have the same color.\n   - We have three colors available: 1, 2, and 3.\n\n3. **Plan the Coloring**:\n   - Start with a vertex and assign it a color.\n   - Move to an adjacent vertex and assign it a different color.\n   - Continue this process, ensuring that no two connected vertices share the same color.\n\n4. **Color the Graph**:\n   - Start with vertex 0 and assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 0 is connected to vertices 5 and 9. Assign vertex 5 color 2 and vertex 9 color 3.\n   - Vertex 1 is connected to vertex 9, which is already colored 3, so assign vertex 1 color 1.\n   - Vertex 2 is connected to vertex 7. Assign vertex 2 color 1 and vertex 7 color 2.\n   - Vertex 3 is connected to vertex 6. Assign vertex 3 color 1 and vertex 6 color 2.\n   - Vertex 4 is not connected to any other vertex, so it can be assigned any color. Assign vertex 4 color 1.\n   - Vertex 8 is not connected to any other vertex, so it can be assigned any color. Assign vertex 8 color 1.\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - Check each edge to ensure that the connected vertices have different colors.\n   - (0, 5): Colors are 1 and 2.\n   - (0, 9): Colors are 1 and 3.\n   - (1, 9): Colors are 1 and 3.\n   - (2, 7): Colors are 1 and 2.\n   - (3, 6): Colors are 1 and 2.\n   - (5, 7): Colors are 2 and 2. (This is incorrect, so we need to adjust.)\n\n6. **Adjust the Coloring**:\n   - Re-evaluate the coloring for vertices 5 and 7. Assign vertex 5 color 3 and vertex 7 color 1.\n   - Re-check the edges:\n     - (0, 5): Colors are 1 and 3.\n     - (0, 9): Colors are 1 and 3.\n     - (1, 9): Colors are 1 and 3.\n     - (2, 7): Colors are 1 and 1. (This is incorrect, so adjust vertex 2 to color 2.)\n     - (3, 6): Colors are 1 and 2.\n     - (5, 7): Colors are 3 and 1.\n\n7. **Final Verification**:\n   - All edges now have vertices with different colors.\n\nThe final coloring of the graph is:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 2, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 3, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 3}>>>"
