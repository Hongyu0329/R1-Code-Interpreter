    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have three possible colors: 1, 2, and 3. Let's analyze the graph step by step:\n\n1. **Vertices and Edges**: \n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(0, 1), (0, 4), (2, 4), (2, 9)]\n\n2. **Graph Structure**:\n   - Vertex 0 is connected to vertices 1 and 4.\n   - Vertex 2 is connected to vertices 4 and 9.\n   - Other vertices (3, 5, 6, 7, 8) are isolated, meaning they have no edges.\n\n3. **Coloring Strategy**:\n   - Start with vertex 0 and assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 1 is adjacent to vertex 0, so it cannot be color 1. Assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 4 is adjacent to vertex 0, so it cannot be color 1. Assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 2 is adjacent to vertex 4, so it cannot be color 2. Assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 9 is adjacent to vertex 2, so it cannot be color 1. Assign it color 2.\n   - Vertices 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8 are isolated, so they can be assigned any color. For simplicity, assign them color 1.\n\n4. **Final Coloring**:\n   - Vertex 0: Color 1\n   - Vertex 1: Color 2\n   - Vertex 2: Color 1\n   - Vertex 3: Color 1\n   - Vertex 4: Color 2\n   - Vertex 5: Color 1\n   - Vertex 6: Color 1\n   - Vertex 7: Color 1\n   - Vertex 8: Color 1\n   - Vertex 9: Color 2\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - Check each edge to ensure no two connected vertices share the same color:\n     - (0, 1): Colors 1 and 2\n     - (0, 4): Colors 1 and 2\n     - (2, 4): Colors 1 and 2\n     - (2, 9): Colors 1 and 2\n   - All conditions are satisfied.\n\nThe final solution is:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 2, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 2, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 2}>>>"
