    "To solve the problem of coloring the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Graph Structure**: \n   - The graph has 10 vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n   - The edges are: (6, 8) and (8, 9). This means:\n     - Vertex 6 is connected to vertex 8.\n     - Vertex 8 is connected to vertex 9.\n\n2. **Identify the Constraints**:\n   - Vertices connected by an edge must not share the same color.\n   - We have three possible colors: 1, 2, and 3.\n\n3. **Color the Graph**:\n   - Start with vertex 6. Assign it the first color, say color 1.\n   - Vertex 8 is connected to vertex 6, so it cannot be color 1. Assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 9 is connected to vertex 8, so it cannot be color 2. Assign it color 1.\n   - Vertices 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 are not connected to any other vertices, so they can be assigned any color. For simplicity, assign them color 1.\n\n4. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - Check that no two connected vertices share the same color:\n     - Vertex 6 (color 1) and vertex 8 (color 2) are different.\n     - Vertex 8 (color 2) and vertex 9 (color 1) are different.\n   - All other vertices are isolated and can have any color.\n\n5. **Prepare the JSON Map**:\n   - Create a JSON map of vertices to their assigned colors.\n\nThe final coloring of the graph is as follows:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 2, \"9\": 1}>>>"
