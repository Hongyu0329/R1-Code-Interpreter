    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. The graph has 10 vertices and 5 edges, and we have 3 possible colors to use.\n\nLet's analyze the graph step by step:\n\n1. **Vertices and Edges**: \n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(0, 5), (1, 9), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5)]\n\n2. **Graph Structure**:\n   - Vertex 5 is connected to vertices 0, 2, 3, and 4.\n   - Vertex 1 is connected to vertex 9.\n   - Vertices 6, 7, and 8 are isolated (not connected to any other vertices).\n\n3. **Coloring Strategy**:\n   - Start by coloring vertex 5, which has the most connections, to minimize conflicts. Assign color 1 to vertex 5.\n   - Color vertices 0, 2, 3, and 4 with a different color than vertex 5. Assign color 2 to these vertices.\n   - Vertex 1 is connected to vertex 9, so they must have different colors. Assign color 1 to vertex 1 and color 2 to vertex 9.\n   - Vertices 6, 7, and 8 are isolated, so they can be colored with any available color. Assign color 1 to these vertices for simplicity.\n\n4. **Final Coloring**:\n   - Vertex 0: Color 2\n   - Vertex 1: Color 1\n   - Vertex 2: Color 2\n   - Vertex 3: Color 2\n   - Vertex 4: Color 2\n   - Vertex 5: Color 1\n   - Vertex 6: Color 1\n   - Vertex 7: Color 1\n   - Vertex 8: Color 1\n   - Vertex 9: Color 2\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - Check that no two adjacent vertices share the same color:\n     - (0, 5): Colors 2 and 1\n     - (1, 9): Colors 1 and 2\n     - (2, 5): Colors 2 and 1\n     - (3, 5): Colors 2 and 1\n     - (4, 5): Colors 2 and 1\n   - All conditions are satisfied.\n\nThe final coloring of the graph is:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 2, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 2, \"3\": 2, \"4\": 2, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 2}>>>"
