    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have 10 vertices and 5 edges, and we can use 3 different colors. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the vertices and edges**: \n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(1, 5), (1, 8), (3, 4), (3, 5), (5, 6)]\n\n2. **Understand the constraints**:\n   - Each vertex must be assigned one of the colors [1, 2, 3].\n   - No two vertices connected by an edge can have the same color.\n\n3. **Plan the coloring**:\n   - Start with a vertex and assign it a color.\n   - Move to an adjacent vertex and assign it a different color.\n   - Continue this process, ensuring that no two connected vertices share the same color.\n\n4. **Assign colors**:\n   - Vertex 1: Assign color 1.\n   - Vertex 5: Connected to vertex 1, assign color 2.\n   - Vertex 8: Connected to vertex 1, assign color 2.\n   - Vertex 3: Assign color 1.\n   - Vertex 4: Connected to vertex 3, assign color 2.\n   - Vertex 6: Connected to vertex 5, assign color 1.\n   - Vertices 0, 2, 7, 9: Not connected to any other vertices in the given edges, so they can be assigned any color. Assign color 1 for simplicity.\n\n5. **Verify the solution**:\n   - Check each edge to ensure no two connected vertices have the same color:\n     - (1, 5): Colors are 1 and 2.\n     - (1, 8): Colors are 1 and 2.\n     - (3, 4): Colors are 1 and 2.\n     - (3, 5): Colors are 1 and 2.\n     - (5, 6): Colors are 2 and 1.\n   - All constraints are satisfied.\n\n6. **Prepare the JSON map**:\n   - Create a JSON map of vertices to their assigned colors.\n\nThe final coloring solution is:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 2, \"5\": 2, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 2, \"9\": 1}>>>"
