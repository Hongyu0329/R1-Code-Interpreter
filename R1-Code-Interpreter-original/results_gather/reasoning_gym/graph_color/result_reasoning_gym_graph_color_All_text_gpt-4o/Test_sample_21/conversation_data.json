    "To solve the problem of coloring the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color, we need to carefully analyze the graph's structure and apply a coloring strategy. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Graph Structure:**\n   - The graph has 10 vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n   - The edges are: (0, 8), (2, 9), (3, 5), (6, 7), (7, 8).\n\n2. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - Each vertex must be colored such that no two connected vertices (i.e., vertices that share an edge) have the same color.\n   - We have three possible colors: 1, 2, and 3.\n\n3. **Plan the Coloring:**\n   - Start with vertices that have the most connections, as they will have the most constraints.\n   - Use a greedy algorithm to assign colors, ensuring no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\n4. **Color the Graph:**\n   - Start with vertex 0. Assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 8 is connected to vertex 0, so it cannot be color 1. Assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 2 is not connected to 0 or 8, so it can be color 1.\n   - Vertex 9 is connected to vertex 2, so it cannot be color 1. Assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 3 is not connected to any colored vertex, so it can be color 1.\n   - Vertex 5 is connected to vertex 3, so it cannot be color 1. Assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 6 is not connected to any colored vertex, so it can be color 1.\n   - Vertex 7 is connected to vertex 6, so it cannot be color 1. Assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 8 is already colored.\n   - Vertex 9 is already colored.\n\n5. **Verify the Coloring:**\n   - Check each edge to ensure no two connected vertices share the same color:\n     - (0, 8): 0 is color 1, 8 is color 2.\n     - (2, 9): 2 is color 1, 9 is color 2.\n     - (3, 5): 3 is color 1, 5 is color 2.\n     - (6, 7): 6 is color 1, 7 is color 2.\n     - (7, 8): 7 is color 2, 8 is color 2. (This is incorrect, so we need to adjust.)\n\n6. **Adjust the Coloring:**\n   - Since vertex 7 and 8 both have color 2, we need to change one of them.\n   - Change vertex 8 to color 3 to resolve the conflict.\n\n7. **Final Coloring:**\n   - Vertex 0: Color 1\n   - Vertex 1: Color 1 (not connected to any other vertex)\n   - Vertex 2: Color 1\n   - Vertex 3: Color 1\n   - Vertex 4: Color 1 (not connected to any other vertex)\n   - Vertex 5: Color 2\n   - Vertex 6: Color 1\n   - Vertex 7: Color 2\n   - Vertex 8: Color 3\n   - Vertex 9: Color 2\n\nThe final coloring ensures no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nAnswer: <<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 2, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 2, \"8\": 3, \"9\": 2}>>>"
