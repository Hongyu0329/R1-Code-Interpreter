    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have 10 vertices and 7 edges, and we can use up to 3 different colors.\n\nLet's analyze the graph step by step:\n\n1. **Vertices and Edges**: \n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(0, 1), (0, 8), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 9)]\n\n2. **Coloring Strategy**:\n   - We will use a greedy algorithm to color the graph. This involves coloring each vertex one by one, choosing the smallest available color that hasn't been used by its adjacent vertices.\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Coloring**:\n   - **Vertex 0**: It is connected to vertices 1 and 8. We can start by coloring vertex 0 with color 1.\n   - **Vertex 1**: It is connected to vertices 0, 4, and 6. Vertex 0 is already colored with 1, so we use color 2 for vertex 1.\n   - **Vertex 2**: It is connected to vertex 7. We can color vertex 2 with color 1.\n   - **Vertex 3**: It is connected to vertex 7. We can color vertex 3 with color 1.\n   - **Vertex 4**: It is connected to vertices 1 and 9. Vertex 1 is colored with 2, so we use color 1 for vertex 4.\n   - **Vertex 5**: It is not connected to any other vertex, so we can use color 1.\n   - **Vertex 6**: It is connected to vertex 1. Vertex 1 is colored with 2, so we use color 1 for vertex 6.\n   - **Vertex 7**: It is connected to vertices 2 and 3. Both vertices 2 and 3 are colored with 1, so we use color 2 for vertex 7.\n   - **Vertex 8**: It is connected to vertex 0. Vertex 0 is colored with 1, so we use color 2 for vertex 8.\n   - **Vertex 9**: It is connected to vertex 4. Vertex 4 is colored with 1, so we use color 2 for vertex 9.\n\n4. **Final Coloring**:\n   - Vertex 0: Color 1\n   - Vertex 1: Color 2\n   - Vertex 2: Color 1\n   - Vertex 3: Color 1\n   - Vertex 4: Color 1\n   - Vertex 5: Color 1\n   - Vertex 6: Color 1\n   - Vertex 7: Color 2\n   - Vertex 8: Color 2\n   - Vertex 9: Color 2\n\nThe final coloring ensures that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nThe JSON map of vertices to colors is:\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 2, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 2, \"8\": 2, \"9\": 2}>>>"
