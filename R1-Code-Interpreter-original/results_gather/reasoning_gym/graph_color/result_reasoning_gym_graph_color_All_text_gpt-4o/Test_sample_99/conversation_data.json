    "To solve the problem of coloring the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Graph Structure**: \n   - We have 10 vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n   - The edges are: (0, 4), (3, 4), (7, 8).\n   - This means vertex 0 is connected to vertex 4, vertex 3 is connected to vertex 4, and vertex 7 is connected to vertex 8.\n\n2. **Identify the Constraints**:\n   - Vertices connected by an edge must not share the same color.\n   - We have three possible colors: 1, 2, and 3.\n\n3. **Plan the Coloring**:\n   - Start by coloring the vertices with edges, as they have constraints.\n   - Choose a color for vertex 0, say color 1.\n   - Vertex 4 is connected to both 0 and 3, so it cannot be the same color as either. If 0 is color 1, choose color 2 for vertex 4.\n   - Vertex 3 is connected to vertex 4, so it cannot be color 2. Choose color 1 for vertex 3.\n   - Vertex 7 and vertex 8 are connected, so they must have different colors. If vertex 7 is color 1, then vertex 8 can be color 2.\n\n4. **Color the Remaining Vertices**:\n   - Vertices 1, 2, 5, 6, and 9 are not connected to any other vertices, so they can be any color. We can choose color 1 for simplicity.\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - Ensure no two connected vertices share the same color.\n   - Check that all vertices are assigned a color.\n\n6. **Construct the JSON Map**:\n   - Create a JSON map of vertices to their assigned colors.\n\nFollowing these steps, the coloring of the graph can be represented as:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 2, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 2, \"9\": 1}>>>"
