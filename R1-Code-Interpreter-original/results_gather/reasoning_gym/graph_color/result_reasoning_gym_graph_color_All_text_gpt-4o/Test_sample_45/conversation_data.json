    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have 10 vertices and 6 edges, and we can use 3 colors: 1, 2, and 3.\n\nLet's analyze the graph step by step:\n\n1. **Vertices and Edges**: \n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 9), (5, 6), (5, 8)]\n\n2. **Graph Structure**:\n   - Vertex 1 is connected to vertex 4.\n   - Vertex 2 is connected to vertex 5.\n   - Vertex 3 is connected to vertices 4 and 9.\n   - Vertex 5 is connected to vertices 2, 6, and 8.\n\n3. **Color Assignment Strategy**:\n   - Start with vertex 0. Since it has no edges, we can assign it any color, say color 1.\n   - Vertex 1 is connected to vertex 4. Assign color 1 to vertex 1.\n   - Vertex 4 is connected to vertices 1 and 3. Assign color 2 to vertex 4.\n   - Vertex 3 is connected to vertices 4 and 9. Assign color 1 to vertex 3.\n   - Vertex 9 is connected to vertex 3. Assign color 2 to vertex 9.\n   - Vertex 2 is connected to vertex 5. Assign color 1 to vertex 2.\n   - Vertex 5 is connected to vertices 2, 6, and 8. Assign color 2 to vertex 5.\n   - Vertex 6 is connected to vertex 5. Assign color 1 to vertex 6.\n   - Vertex 8 is connected to vertex 5. Assign color 1 to vertex 8.\n   - Vertex 7 is isolated (no edges), so we can assign it any color, say color 1.\n\n4. **Final Color Assignment**:\n   - Vertex 0: Color 1\n   - Vertex 1: Color 1\n   - Vertex 2: Color 1\n   - Vertex 3: Color 1\n   - Vertex 4: Color 2\n   - Vertex 5: Color 2\n   - Vertex 6: Color 1\n   - Vertex 7: Color 1\n   - Vertex 8: Color 1\n   - Vertex 9: Color 2\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - Check each edge to ensure no two connected vertices have the same color:\n     - (1, 4): Colors 1 and 2\n     - (2, 5): Colors 1 and 2\n     - (3, 4): Colors 1 and 2\n     - (3, 9): Colors 1 and 2\n     - (5, 6): Colors 2 and 1\n     - (5, 8): Colors 2 and 1\n\nAll edges have vertices with different colors, satisfying the graph coloring condition.\n\nThe final solution is:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 2, \"5\": 2, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 2}>>>"
