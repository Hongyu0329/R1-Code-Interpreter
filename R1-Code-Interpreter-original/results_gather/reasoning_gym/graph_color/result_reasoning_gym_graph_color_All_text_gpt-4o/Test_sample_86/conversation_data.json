    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. The graph has 10 vertices and 3 edges, and we have 3 possible colors to use.\n\nLet's analyze the graph step by step:\n\n1. **Vertices and Edges**: \n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(0, 4), (0, 6), (5, 7)]\n\n2. **Graph Structure**:\n   - Vertex 0 is connected to vertices 4 and 6.\n   - Vertex 5 is connected to vertex 7.\n   - All other vertices (1, 2, 3, 8, 9) are isolated, meaning they have no edges connecting them to other vertices.\n\n3. **Coloring Strategy**:\n   - We need to ensure that connected vertices do not share the same color.\n   - Since we have 3 colors available, we can use them to ensure no two connected vertices have the same color.\n\n4. **Assign Colors**:\n   - Start with vertex 0. Assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 4 is connected to vertex 0, so it cannot be color 1. Assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 6 is also connected to vertex 0, so it cannot be color 1. Assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 5 can be assigned color 1.\n   - Vertex 7 is connected to vertex 5, so it cannot be color 1. Assign it color 2.\n   - Vertices 1, 2, 3, 8, and 9 are isolated, so they can be assigned any color. For simplicity, assign them color 1.\n\n5. **Final Coloring**:\n   - Vertex 0: Color 1\n   - Vertex 1: Color 1\n   - Vertex 2: Color 1\n   - Vertex 3: Color 1\n   - Vertex 4: Color 2\n   - Vertex 5: Color 1\n   - Vertex 6: Color 2\n   - Vertex 7: Color 2\n   - Vertex 8: Color 1\n   - Vertex 9: Color 1\n\nThe final coloring ensures that no two connected vertices share the same color.\n\nThe solution in JSON format is:\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 2, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 2, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 1}>>>"
