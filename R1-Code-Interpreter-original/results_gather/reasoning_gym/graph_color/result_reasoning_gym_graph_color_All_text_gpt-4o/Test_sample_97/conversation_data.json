    "To solve the problem of coloring the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Graph Structure**:\n   - We have 10 vertices: 0 through 9.\n   - There are only two edges: (0, 1) and (2, 9).\n   - This means vertex 0 is connected to vertex 1, and vertex 2 is connected to vertex 9. All other vertices are isolated or not directly connected to each other.\n\n2. **Identify the Coloring Constraints**:\n   - Vertices connected by an edge must have different colors.\n   - We have three possible colors: 1, 2, and 3.\n\n3. **Assign Colors to Vertices**:\n   - Start by coloring the vertices connected by edges:\n     - For edge (0, 1), assign different colors to vertices 0 and 1. For example, color vertex 0 with color 1 and vertex 1 with color 2.\n     - For edge (2, 9), assign different colors to vertices 2 and 9. For example, color vertex 2 with color 1 and vertex 9 with color 2.\n   - The remaining vertices (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) are not connected to any other vertices, so they can be colored with any of the available colors. To keep it simple, we can assign them all the same color, such as color 1.\n\n4. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - Ensure that no two connected vertices share the same color:\n     - Vertex 0 (color 1) and vertex 1 (color 2) are correctly colored.\n     - Vertex 2 (color 1) and vertex 9 (color 2) are correctly colored.\n   - All other vertices are isolated and can have any color.\n\n5. **Construct the JSON Map**:\n   - Create a JSON map of vertices to their assigned colors.\n\nFollowing these steps, the coloring solution is:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 2, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 2}>>>"
