    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have 10 vertices and 4 edges, and we can use up to 3 different colors.\n\nLet's analyze the graph step by step:\n\n1. **Vertices and Edges**: \n   - We have vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n   - The edges are: (1, 4), (1, 6), (4, 7), (7, 8).\n\n2. **Graph Structure**:\n   - Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 4 and 6.\n   - Vertex 4 is connected to vertices 1 and 7.\n   - Vertex 7 is connected to vertices 4 and 8.\n   - Vertex 8 is connected to vertex 7.\n\n3. **Color Assignment**:\n   - We start by coloring vertex 1 with color 1.\n   - Vertex 4, which is connected to vertex 1, cannot be color 1. We assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 6, which is also connected to vertex 1, cannot be color 1. We assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 7, which is connected to vertex 4, cannot be color 2. We assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 8, which is connected to vertex 7, cannot be color 1. We assign it color 2.\n\n4. **Remaining Vertices**:\n   - Vertices 0, 2, 3, 5, and 9 are not connected to any other vertices in the given edges, so they can be assigned any color. We can assign them color 1 for simplicity.\n\n5. **Final Coloring**:\n   - Vertex 0: Color 1\n   - Vertex 1: Color 1\n   - Vertex 2: Color 1\n   - Vertex 3: Color 1\n   - Vertex 4: Color 2\n   - Vertex 5: Color 1\n   - Vertex 6: Color 2\n   - Vertex 7: Color 1\n   - Vertex 8: Color 2\n   - Vertex 9: Color 1\n\nThe final coloring ensures that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nThe solution in JSON format is:\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 2, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 2, \"9\": 1}>>>"
