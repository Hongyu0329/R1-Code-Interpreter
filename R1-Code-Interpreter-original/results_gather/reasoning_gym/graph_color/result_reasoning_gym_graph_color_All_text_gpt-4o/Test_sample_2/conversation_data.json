    "To solve the problem of coloring the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color, we need to carefully analyze the given graph properties and constraints. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Graph Structure:**\n   - We have 10 vertices labeled from 0 to 9.\n   - The edges are given as pairs of vertices: (0, 9), (1, 8), and (1, 9).\n   - This means vertex 0 is connected to vertex 9, vertex 1 is connected to vertices 8 and 9.\n\n2. **Identify the Constraints:**\n   - No two connected vertices can have the same color.\n   - We have three possible colors to use: 1, 2, and 3.\n\n3. **Plan the Coloring:**\n   - Start by coloring the vertices with the most connections first, as they have the highest constraints.\n   - Vertex 1 is connected to two other vertices (8 and 9), so we start with it.\n\n4. **Color the Vertices:**\n   - Assign color 1 to vertex 1.\n   - Vertex 8 is connected to vertex 1, so it cannot be color 1. Assign color 2 to vertex 8.\n   - Vertex 9 is connected to both vertices 0 and 1. Since vertex 1 is color 1, assign color 2 to vertex 9.\n   - Vertex 0 is connected to vertex 9, which is color 2, so assign color 1 to vertex 0.\n\n5. **Color the Remaining Vertices:**\n   - Vertices 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are not connected to any other vertices, so they can be any color. For simplicity, assign color 1 to all of them.\n\n6. **Verify the Solution:**\n   - Check that no two connected vertices share the same color:\n     - (0, 9): Vertex 0 is color 1, vertex 9 is color 2.\n     - (1, 8): Vertex 1 is color 1, vertex 8 is color 2.\n     - (1, 9): Vertex 1 is color 1, vertex 9 is color 2.\n   - All constraints are satisfied.\n\n7. **Output the Solution:**\n   - Create a JSON map of vertices to colors.\n\nThe final coloring of the graph is as follows:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 2, \"9\": 2}>>>"
