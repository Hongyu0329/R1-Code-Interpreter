    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have 10 vertices and 7 edges, and we can use up to 3 different colors.\n\nLet's analyze the graph step by step:\n\n1. **Vertices and Edges**: \n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(0, 7), (0, 9), (1, 4), (2, 8), (4, 5), (7, 8), (8, 9)]\n\n2. **Graph Structure**:\n   - Vertex 0 is connected to vertices 7 and 9.\n   - Vertex 1 is connected to vertex 4.\n   - Vertex 2 is connected to vertex 8.\n   - Vertex 4 is connected to vertex 5.\n   - Vertex 7 is connected to vertex 8.\n   - Vertex 8 is connected to vertex 9.\n\n3. **Color Assignment Strategy**:\n   - Start with vertex 0 and assign it color 1.\n   - Assign colors to adjacent vertices ensuring no two connected vertices share the same color.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Coloring**:\n   - **Vertex 0**: Assign color 1.\n   - **Vertex 7**: Adjacent to 0, assign color 2.\n   - **Vertex 9**: Adjacent to 0, assign color 2.\n   - **Vertex 8**: Adjacent to 7 and 9, assign color 1.\n   - **Vertex 2**: Adjacent to 8, assign color 2.\n   - **Vertex 1**: Assign color 1 (not adjacent to any colored vertex yet).\n   - **Vertex 4**: Adjacent to 1, assign color 2.\n   - **Vertex 5**: Adjacent to 4, assign color 1.\n   - **Vertex 3**: Not adjacent to any colored vertex, assign color 1.\n   - **Vertex 6**: Not adjacent to any colored vertex, assign color 1.\n\n5. **Final Coloring**:\n   - Vertex 0: Color 1\n   - Vertex 1: Color 1\n   - Vertex 2: Color 2\n   - Vertex 3: Color 1\n   - Vertex 4: Color 2\n   - Vertex 5: Color 1\n   - Vertex 6: Color 1\n   - Vertex 7: Color 2\n   - Vertex 8: Color 1\n   - Vertex 9: Color 2\n\nThis coloring ensures that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 2, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 2, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 2, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 2}>>>"
