    "To solve the problem of coloring the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Graph Structure**: \n   - We have 10 vertices labeled from 0 to 9.\n   - There are only two edges: (0, 2) and (1, 6).\n   - This means that vertex 0 is connected to vertex 2, and vertex 1 is connected to vertex 6. All other vertices are isolated or not directly connected to each other.\n\n2. **Identify the Coloring Constraint**:\n   - We need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two connected vertices have the same color.\n   - The available colors are 1, 2, and 3.\n\n3. **Assign Colors to Vertices**:\n   - Start with the vertices that have edges:\n     - For edge (0, 2), assign different colors to vertices 0 and 2. For example, assign color 1 to vertex 0 and color 2 to vertex 2.\n     - For edge (1, 6), assign different colors to vertices 1 and 6. For example, assign color 1 to vertex 1 and color 2 to vertex 6.\n   - The remaining vertices (3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9) are not connected to any other vertices, so they can be assigned any color. For simplicity, assign color 1 to all of them.\n\n4. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - Ensure that no two connected vertices share the same color:\n     - Vertex 0 (color 1) and vertex 2 (color 2) are correctly colored.\n     - Vertex 1 (color 1) and vertex 6 (color 2) are correctly colored.\n   - All other vertices are isolated, so their colors do not affect the solution.\n\n5. **Construct the JSON Map**:\n   - Create a JSON map of vertices to their assigned colors.\n\nFollowing these steps, the coloring solution is:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 2, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 1}>>>"
