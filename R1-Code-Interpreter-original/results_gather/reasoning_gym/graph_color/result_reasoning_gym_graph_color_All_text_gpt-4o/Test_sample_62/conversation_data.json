    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have 10 vertices and 7 edges, and we can use up to 3 different colors.\n\nLet's analyze the graph step by step:\n\n1. **Vertices and Edges**: \n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 9), (3, 5), (4, 8), (7, 9)]\n\n2. **Coloring Strategy**:\n   - We will start coloring from vertex 0 and proceed to other vertices, ensuring no two connected vertices have the same color.\n   - We have 3 colors available: [1, 2, 3].\n\n3. **Step-by-Step Coloring**:\n   - **Vertex 0**: Start with color 1.\n   - **Vertex 4**: Connected to vertex 0, so use color 2.\n   - **Vertex 8**: Connected to vertex 4, so use color 1.\n   - **Vertex 1**: Not connected to 0, 4, or 8, so use color 1.\n   - **Vertex 2**: Connected to vertex 1, so use color 2.\n   - **Vertex 3**: Connected to vertex 1, so use color 2.\n   - **Vertex 5**: Connected to vertex 3, so use color 1.\n   - **Vertex 9**: Connected to vertex 1, so use color 2.\n   - **Vertex 7**: Connected to vertex 9, so use color 1.\n   - **Vertex 6**: Not connected to any colored vertex, so use color 1.\n\n4. **Final Coloring**:\n   - Vertex 0: Color 1\n   - Vertex 1: Color 1\n   - Vertex 2: Color 2\n   - Vertex 3: Color 2\n   - Vertex 4: Color 2\n   - Vertex 5: Color 1\n   - Vertex 6: Color 1\n   - Vertex 7: Color 1\n   - Vertex 8: Color 1\n   - Vertex 9: Color 2\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - Check each edge to ensure no two connected vertices have the same color:\n     - (0, 4): Colors 1 and 2\n     - (1, 2): Colors 1 and 2\n     - (1, 3): Colors 1 and 2\n     - (1, 9): Colors 1 and 2\n     - (3, 5): Colors 2 and 1\n     - (4, 8): Colors 2 and 1\n     - (7, 9): Colors 1 and 2\n\nAll edges are properly colored, satisfying the condition.\n\nThe final JSON map of vertices to colors is:\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 2, \"3\": 2, \"4\": 2, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 2}>>>"
