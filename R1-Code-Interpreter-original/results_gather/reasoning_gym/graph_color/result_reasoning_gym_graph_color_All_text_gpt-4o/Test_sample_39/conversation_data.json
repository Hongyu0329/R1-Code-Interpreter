    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have 10 vertices and 7 edges, and we can use up to 3 different colors.\n\nLet's analyze the graph step by step:\n\n1. **Vertices and Edges**: \n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(0, 7), (1, 9), (3, 4), (3, 6), (5, 6), (5, 7), (5, 8)]\n\n2. **Graph Structure**:\n   - Vertex 0 is connected to vertex 7.\n   - Vertex 1 is connected to vertex 9.\n   - Vertex 3 is connected to vertices 4 and 6.\n   - Vertex 5 is connected to vertices 6, 7, and 8.\n\n3. **Color Assignment Strategy**:\n   - We will start by coloring the vertices with the highest degree (most connections) first, as they have the most constraints.\n   - We will use the colors [1, 2, 3] and ensure no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Coloring**:\n   - **Vertex 5**: It has the highest degree (3 connections). Assign color 1.\n   - **Vertex 6**: Connected to vertices 3 and 5. Assign color 2 (since 5 is color 1).\n   - **Vertex 7**: Connected to vertices 0 and 5. Assign color 2 (since 5 is color 1).\n   - **Vertex 8**: Connected to vertex 5. Assign color 2 (since 5 is color 1).\n   - **Vertex 3**: Connected to vertices 4 and 6. Assign color 1 (since 6 is color 2).\n   - **Vertex 4**: Connected to vertex 3. Assign color 2 (since 3 is color 1).\n   - **Vertex 0**: Connected to vertex 7. Assign color 1 (since 7 is color 2).\n   - **Vertex 1**: Connected to vertex 9. Assign color 1 (since 9 is not yet colored).\n   - **Vertex 9**: Connected to vertex 1. Assign color 2 (since 1 is color 1).\n   - **Vertex 2**: Not connected to any other vertex, can be any color. Assign color 1.\n\n5. **Final Coloring**:\n   - Vertex 0: Color 1\n   - Vertex 1: Color 1\n   - Vertex 2: Color 1\n   - Vertex 3: Color 1\n   - Vertex 4: Color 2\n   - Vertex 5: Color 1\n   - Vertex 6: Color 2\n   - Vertex 7: Color 2\n   - Vertex 8: Color 2\n   - Vertex 9: Color 2\n\nThe final JSON map of vertices to colors is:\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 2, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 2, \"8\": 2, \"9\": 2}>>>"
