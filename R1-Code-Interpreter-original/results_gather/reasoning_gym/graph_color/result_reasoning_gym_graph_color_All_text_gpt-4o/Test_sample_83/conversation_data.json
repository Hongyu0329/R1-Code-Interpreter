    "To solve the problem of coloring the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color, we need to carefully analyze the given graph properties and constraints. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Graph Structure:**\n   - The graph has 10 vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].\n   - There is only one edge: (1, 5). This means vertex 1 is connected to vertex 5.\n\n2. **Understand the Coloring Constraint:**\n   - We need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two connected vertices have the same color.\n   - The available colors are [1, 2, 3].\n\n3. **Analyze the Edge Constraint:**\n   - Since there is only one edge (1, 5), we must ensure that vertices 1 and 5 have different colors.\n\n4. **Assign Colors to Vertices:**\n   - Start by assigning a color to vertex 1. We can choose any color from the available set, say color 1.\n   - Assign a different color to vertex 5, say color 2, to satisfy the edge constraint.\n\n5. **Assign Colors to Remaining Vertices:**\n   - The remaining vertices [0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9] are not connected to any other vertices, so they can be assigned any color. For simplicity, we can assign them all the same color, say color 1.\n\n6. **Construct the JSON Map:**\n   - Create a JSON map of vertices to their assigned colors.\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that the graph is properly colored according to the given constraints. The final coloring solution is:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 2, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 1}>>>"
