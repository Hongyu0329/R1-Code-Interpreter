    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have 10 vertices and 6 edges, and we can use up to 3 different colors.\n\nLet's analyze the graph step by step:\n\n1. **Vertices and Edges**: \n   - We have vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n   - The edges are: (0, 1), (3, 8), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (8, 9).\n\n2. **Graph Structure**:\n   - Vertex 0 is connected to vertex 1.\n   - Vertex 3 is connected to vertex 8.\n   - Vertex 4 is connected to vertices 7, 8, and 9.\n   - Vertex 8 is connected to vertex 9.\n\n3. **Color Assignment Strategy**:\n   - Start with vertex 0 and assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 1 is adjacent to vertex 0, so assign it a different color, say color 2.\n   - Vertex 2 is not connected to any other vertex, so it can be assigned any color, say color 1.\n   - Vertex 3 is connected to vertex 8, so assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 4 is connected to vertices 7, 8, and 9. Assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 5 is not connected to any other vertex, so it can be assigned any color, say color 1.\n   - Vertex 6 is not connected to any other vertex, so it can be assigned any color, say color 1.\n   - Vertex 7 is connected to vertex 4, so assign it a different color, say color 2.\n   - Vertex 8 is connected to vertices 3, 4, and 9. Assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 9 is connected to vertices 4 and 8. Assign it color 3.\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   - Check each edge to ensure no two connected vertices have the same color:\n     - (0, 1): Colors are 1 and 2.\n     - (3, 8): Colors are 1 and 2.\n     - (4, 7): Colors are 1 and 2.\n     - (4, 8): Colors are 1 and 2.\n     - (4, 9): Colors are 1 and 3.\n     - (8, 9): Colors are 2 and 3.\n\nAll edges have vertices with different colors, so the coloring is valid.\n\nThe final coloring of the graph is:\n- Vertex 0: Color 1\n- Vertex 1: Color 2\n- Vertex 2: Color 1\n- Vertex 3: Color 1\n- Vertex 4: Color 1\n- Vertex 5: Color 1\n- Vertex 6: Color 1\n- Vertex 7: Color 2\n- Vertex 8: Color 2\n- Vertex 9: Color 3\n\nThe JSON map of vertices to colors is:\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 2, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 2, \"8\": 2, \"9\": 3}>>>"
