    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. The graph is defined by its vertices and edges, and we have three possible colors to use.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the vertices and edges:**\n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(1, 4), (4, 5), (5, 8)]\n\n2. **Understand the constraints:**\n   - Each vertex must be assigned one of the colors [1, 2, 3].\n   - Adjacent vertices (connected by an edge) must not share the same color.\n\n3. **Plan the coloring:**\n   - Start with the vertices that have the most constraints (i.e., those involved in edges).\n   - Assign colors to these vertices first, ensuring no two connected vertices share the same color.\n   - Then, assign colors to the remaining vertices, which are not connected by any edges, so they can be colored freely.\n\n4. **Color the vertices:**\n   - Start with vertex 1. Assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 4 is connected to vertex 1, so it cannot be color 1. Assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 5 is connected to vertex 4, so it cannot be color 2. Assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 8 is connected to vertex 5, so it cannot be color 1. Assign it color 2.\n   - Vertices 0, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 9 are not connected by any edges, so they can be assigned any color. For simplicity, assign them color 1.\n\n5. **Verify the solution:**\n   - Check that no two connected vertices share the same color:\n     - (1, 4): Colors are 1 and 2.\n     - (4, 5): Colors are 2 and 1.\n     - (5, 8): Colors are 1 and 2.\n   - All constraints are satisfied.\n\n6. **Prepare the JSON map:**\n   - Create a JSON map of vertices to their assigned colors.\n\nThe final coloring solution is:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 2, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 2, \"9\": 1}>>>"
