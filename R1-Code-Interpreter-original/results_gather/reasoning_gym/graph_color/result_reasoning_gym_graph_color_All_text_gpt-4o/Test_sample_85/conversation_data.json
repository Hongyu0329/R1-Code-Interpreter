    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have 10 vertices and 5 edges, and we can use up to 3 different colors.\n\nLet's analyze the graph step by step:\n\n1. **Vertices and Edges**: \n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(1, 5), (3, 8), (4, 5), (7, 8), (8, 9)]\n\n2. **Graph Structure**:\n   - The graph is sparse, with only 5 edges connecting 10 vertices.\n   - The edges indicate the following connections:\n     - Vertex 1 is connected to Vertex 5.\n     - Vertex 3 is connected to Vertex 8.\n     - Vertex 4 is connected to Vertex 5.\n     - Vertex 7 is connected to Vertex 8.\n     - Vertex 8 is connected to Vertex 9.\n\n3. **Color Assignment Strategy**:\n   - We have 3 colors available: [1, 2, 3].\n   - We need to ensure that no two connected vertices share the same color.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Coloring**:\n   - Start with Vertex 1 and assign it Color 1.\n   - Vertex 5 is connected to Vertex 1, so assign it a different color, say Color 2.\n   - Vertex 4 is connected to Vertex 5, so assign it a different color from Vertex 5, say Color 1.\n   - Vertex 3 is not connected to any colored vertex yet, so assign it Color 1.\n   - Vertex 8 is connected to Vertex 3, so assign it a different color, say Color 2.\n   - Vertex 7 is connected to Vertex 8, so assign it a different color from Vertex 8, say Color 1.\n   - Vertex 9 is connected to Vertex 8, so assign it a different color from Vertex 8, say Color 1.\n   - Vertices 0, 2, and 6 are not connected to any other vertices, so they can be assigned any color. Assign them Color 1.\n\n5. **Final Coloring**:\n   - Vertex 0: Color 1\n   - Vertex 1: Color 1\n   - Vertex 2: Color 1\n   - Vertex 3: Color 1\n   - Vertex 4: Color 1\n   - Vertex 5: Color 2\n   - Vertex 6: Color 1\n   - Vertex 7: Color 1\n   - Vertex 8: Color 2\n   - Vertex 9: Color 1\n\nThe final coloring ensures that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nThe solution in JSON format is:\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 2, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 2, \"9\": 1}>>>"
