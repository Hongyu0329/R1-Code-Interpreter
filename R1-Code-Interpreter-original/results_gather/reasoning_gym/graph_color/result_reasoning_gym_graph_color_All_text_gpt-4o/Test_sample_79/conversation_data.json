    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. The graph has 10 vertices and only two edges, which makes it relatively sparse. We have three colors available: 1, 2, and 3.\n\nLet's analyze the graph step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the vertices and edges:**\n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(2, 3), (2, 8)]\n\n2. **Understand the constraints:**\n   - Vertex 2 is connected to vertices 3 and 8.\n   - Vertices 3 and 8 are not directly connected to each other.\n\n3. **Assign colors to the vertices:**\n   - Start with vertex 2, which is connected to both 3 and 8. Assign it color 1.\n   - Assign vertex 3 a different color from vertex 2. Use color 2.\n   - Assign vertex 8 a different color from vertex 2. Use color 2.\n\n4. **Assign colors to the remaining vertices:**\n   - Vertices 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9 are not connected to any other vertices in the graph. Therefore, they can be assigned any of the available colors. For simplicity, assign them color 1.\n\n5. **Verify the coloring:**\n   - Check that no two adjacent vertices have the same color:\n     - Vertex 2 (color 1) is adjacent to vertex 3 (color 2) and vertex 8 (color 2), which satisfies the condition.\n     - Vertices 3 and 8 are not adjacent, so their shared color does not violate the condition.\n\n6. **Construct the JSON map:**\n   - Based on the above assignments, the JSON map of vertices to colors is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"0\": 1,\n  \"1\": 1,\n  \"2\": 1,\n  \"3\": 2,\n  \"4\": 1,\n  \"5\": 1,\n  \"6\": 1,\n  \"7\": 1,\n  \"8\": 2,\n  \"9\": 1\n}\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 2, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 2, \"9\": 1}>>>"
