    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. The graph has 10 vertices and 4 edges, and we have 3 possible colors to use.\n\nLet's analyze the graph step by step:\n\n1. **Vertices and Edges**: \n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(2, 4), (3, 9), (4, 9), (6, 7)]\n\n2. **Graph Structure**:\n   - Vertex 2 is connected to vertex 4.\n   - Vertex 3 is connected to vertex 9.\n   - Vertex 4 is connected to vertex 9.\n   - Vertex 6 is connected to vertex 7.\n\n3. **Color Assignment Strategy**:\n   - We have 3 colors available: [1, 2, 3].\n   - We need to ensure that no two connected vertices have the same color.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Coloring**:\n   - Start with vertex 2 and assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 4 is connected to vertex 2, so assign it a different color, say color 2.\n   - Vertex 3 can be assigned color 1 (since it is not connected to vertex 2 or 4).\n   - Vertex 9 is connected to both vertex 3 and vertex 4, so assign it color 3.\n   - Vertex 6 can be assigned color 1 (since it is not connected to any of the previously colored vertices).\n   - Vertex 7 is connected to vertex 6, so assign it a different color, say color 2.\n   - Vertices 0, 1, 5, and 8 are not connected to any other vertices, so they can be assigned any color. For simplicity, assign them color 1.\n\n5. **Final Coloring**:\n   - Vertex 0: Color 1\n   - Vertex 1: Color 1\n   - Vertex 2: Color 1\n   - Vertex 3: Color 1\n   - Vertex 4: Color 2\n   - Vertex 5: Color 1\n   - Vertex 6: Color 1\n   - Vertex 7: Color 2\n   - Vertex 8: Color 1\n   - Vertex 9: Color 3\n\n6. **Verification**:\n   - Check each edge to ensure no two connected vertices have the same color:\n     - (2, 4): Colors are 1 and 2.\n     - (3, 9): Colors are 1 and 3.\n     - (4, 9): Colors are 2 and 3.\n     - (6, 7): Colors are 1 and 2.\n   - All conditions are satisfied.\n\nThe final solution is a JSON map of vertices to colors:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 2, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 2, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 3}>>>"
