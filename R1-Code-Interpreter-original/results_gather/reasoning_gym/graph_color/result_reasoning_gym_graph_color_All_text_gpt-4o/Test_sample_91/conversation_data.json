    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have 10 vertices and 5 edges, and we can use 3 colors: 1, 2, and 3.\n\nLet's analyze the graph step by step:\n\n1. **Vertices and Edges**: \n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(0, 9), (2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 8), (5, 7)]\n\n2. **Graph Structure**:\n   - Vertex 0 is connected to vertex 9.\n   - Vertex 2 is connected to vertices 3 and 6.\n   - Vertex 3 is connected to vertex 8.\n   - Vertex 5 is connected to vertex 7.\n\n3. **Color Assignment Strategy**:\n   - Start with vertex 0 and assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 9 is adjacent to vertex 0, so assign it a different color, say color 2.\n   - Vertex 2 can be assigned color 1 (since it is not adjacent to 0 or 9).\n   - Vertex 3 is adjacent to vertex 2, so assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 6 is adjacent to vertex 2, so assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 8 is adjacent to vertex 3, so assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 5 can be assigned color 1 (since it is not adjacent to any colored vertex yet).\n   - Vertex 7 is adjacent to vertex 5, so assign it color 2.\n   - Vertices 1 and 4 are isolated (no edges), so they can be assigned any color. Assign them color 1.\n\n4. **Final Color Assignment**:\n   - Vertex 0: Color 1\n   - Vertex 1: Color 1\n   - Vertex 2: Color 1\n   - Vertex 3: Color 2\n   - Vertex 4: Color 1\n   - Vertex 5: Color 1\n   - Vertex 6: Color 2\n   - Vertex 7: Color 2\n   - Vertex 8: Color 1\n   - Vertex 9: Color 2\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - Check each edge to ensure no two connected vertices share the same color:\n     - (0, 9): Colors 1 and 2\n     - (2, 3): Colors 1 and 2\n     - (2, 6): Colors 1 and 2\n     - (3, 8): Colors 2 and 1\n     - (5, 7): Colors 1 and 2\n\nAll conditions are satisfied, and no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 2, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 2, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 2}>>>"
