    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have 10 vertices and 6 edges, and we can use up to 3 different colors.\n\nLet's analyze the graph step by step:\n\n1. **Vertices and Edges**: \n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(0, 4), (1, 7), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (6, 8)]\n\n2. **Graph Structure**:\n   - Vertex 0 is connected to vertex 4.\n   - Vertex 1 is connected to vertex 7.\n   - Vertex 3 is connected to vertices 5 and 6.\n   - Vertex 4 is connected to vertex 5.\n   - Vertex 6 is connected to vertex 8.\n\n3. **Color Assignment Strategy**:\n   - Start with vertex 0 and assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 4 is adjacent to vertex 0, so assign it a different color, say color 2.\n   - Vertex 5 is adjacent to vertex 4, so assign it color 1 (since 4 is color 2).\n   - Vertex 3 is adjacent to vertex 5, so assign it color 2 (since 5 is color 1).\n   - Vertex 6 is adjacent to vertex 3, so assign it color 1 (since 3 is color 2).\n   - Vertex 8 is adjacent to vertex 6, so assign it color 2 (since 6 is color 1).\n   - Vertex 1 is not adjacent to any colored vertex yet, so assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 7 is adjacent to vertex 1, so assign it color 2 (since 1 is color 1).\n   - Vertices 2 and 9 are isolated (not connected to any other vertices), so they can be assigned any color. Assign them color 1.\n\n4. **Final Color Assignment**:\n   - 0: 1\n   - 1: 1\n   - 2: 1\n   - 3: 2\n   - 4: 2\n   - 5: 1\n   - 6: 1\n   - 7: 2\n   - 8: 2\n   - 9: 1\n\nThis assignment ensures that no two adjacent vertices share the same color, and we have used only two colors, which is within the allowed limit of three colors.\n\nThe final JSON map of vertices to colors is:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 2, \"4\": 2, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 2, \"8\": 2, \"9\": 1}>>>"
