    "To solve the problem of coloring the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Graph Structure**: \n   - We have 10 vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n   - There are 3 edges: (1, 6), (2, 8), and (4, 6).\n   - This means vertex 1 is connected to vertex 6, vertex 2 is connected to vertex 8, and vertex 4 is connected to vertex 6.\n\n2. **Identify the Coloring Constraints**:\n   - Vertices connected by an edge must not share the same color.\n   - We have 3 possible colors: 1, 2, and 3.\n\n3. **Plan the Coloring**:\n   - Start by coloring the vertices involved in the edges, as they have constraints.\n   - Choose a color for vertex 1, then a different color for vertex 6.\n   - Choose a color for vertex 2, then a different color for vertex 8.\n   - Choose a color for vertex 4, then a different color for vertex 6 (already colored).\n\n4. **Assign Colors**:\n   - Assign color 1 to vertex 1.\n   - Assign color 2 to vertex 6 (since it cannot be the same as vertex 1).\n   - Assign color 1 to vertex 2.\n   - Assign color 2 to vertex 8 (since it cannot be the same as vertex 2).\n   - Assign color 3 to vertex 4 (since vertex 6 is already colored with 2).\n\n5. **Color Remaining Vertices**:\n   - Vertices 0, 3, 5, 7, and 9 are not connected to any other vertices, so they can be colored with any of the available colors. For simplicity, assign them color 1.\n\n6. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - Ensure no two connected vertices share the same color.\n   - Check that all vertices are assigned a color.\n\n7. **Output the Solution**:\n   - Create a JSON map of vertices to their assigned colors.\n\nFollowing these steps, the coloring of the graph is:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 3, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 2, \"9\": 1}>>>"
