    "To solve the problem of coloring the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Graph Structure**: \n   - We have 10 vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n   - There are only two edges: (2, 9) and (5, 9).\n\n2. **Identify the Constraints**:\n   - Vertices 2 and 9 are connected, so they must have different colors.\n   - Vertices 5 and 9 are connected, so they must also have different colors.\n   - Vertices 2 and 5 are not directly connected, so they can potentially share the same color.\n\n3. **Choose Colors for Each Vertex**:\n   - We have three colors available: 1, 2, and 3.\n   - Start by coloring vertex 9, which is connected to both 2 and 5. Assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 2 is connected to vertex 9, so it cannot be color 1. Assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 5 is also connected to vertex 9, so it cannot be color 1. Assign it color 2 as well.\n   - The remaining vertices (0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8) are not connected to any other vertices, so they can be assigned any color. For simplicity, assign them color 1.\n\n4. **Verify the Coloring**:\n   - Check that no two connected vertices share the same color:\n     - Vertex 2 (color 2) and vertex 9 (color 1) are different.\n     - Vertex 5 (color 2) and vertex 9 (color 1) are different.\n   - All other vertices are not connected, so their colors do not matter in terms of adjacency.\n\n5. **Create the JSON Map**:\n   - Construct a JSON map of vertices to their assigned colors.\n\nFollowing these steps, the final coloring of the graph is:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 2, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 2, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 1}>>>"
