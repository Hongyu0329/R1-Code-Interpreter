    "To solve the problem of coloring the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Graph Structure**: \n   - We have 10 vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n   - The edges are: (1, 6), (3, 6), (3, 9), (4, 5).\n   - This means vertex 1 is connected to vertex 6, vertex 3 is connected to vertices 6 and 9, and vertex 4 is connected to vertex 5.\n\n2. **Identify the Coloring Constraints**:\n   - Vertices connected by an edge must have different colors.\n   - We have three colors available: 1, 2, and 3.\n\n3. **Plan the Coloring**:\n   - Start by coloring the vertices with the most connections first, as they have the most constraints.\n   - Vertex 3 is connected to two other vertices (6 and 9), so we start with it. Assign color 1 to vertex 3.\n   - Vertex 6 is connected to vertices 1 and 3. Since vertex 3 is colored 1, we can color vertex 6 with color 2.\n   - Vertex 9 is connected to vertex 3, which is colored 1, so we can color vertex 9 with color 2.\n   - Vertex 1 is connected to vertex 6, which is colored 2, so we can color vertex 1 with color 1.\n   - Vertex 4 is connected to vertex 5. We can color vertex 4 with color 1 and vertex 5 with color 2.\n   - The remaining vertices (0, 2, 7, 8) are not connected to any other vertices, so they can be colored with any available color. We can choose color 1 for simplicity.\n\n4. **Assign Colors**:\n   - Vertex 0: Color 1\n   - Vertex 1: Color 1\n   - Vertex 2: Color 1\n   - Vertex 3: Color 1\n   - Vertex 4: Color 1\n   - Vertex 5: Color 2\n   - Vertex 6: Color 2\n   - Vertex 7: Color 1\n   - Vertex 8: Color 1\n   - Vertex 9: Color 2\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - Check each edge to ensure no two connected vertices share the same color:\n     - (1, 6): Colors are 1 and 2.\n     - (3, 6): Colors are 1 and 2.\n     - (3, 9): Colors are 1 and 2.\n     - (4, 5): Colors are 1 and 2.\n   - All constraints are satisfied.\n\nThe final coloring of the graph is:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 2, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 2}>>>"
