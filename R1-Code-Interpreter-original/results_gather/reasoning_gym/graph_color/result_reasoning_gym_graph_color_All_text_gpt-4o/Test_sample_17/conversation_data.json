    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have 10 vertices and 5 edges, and we can use up to 3 different colors.\n\nLet's analyze the graph step by step:\n\n1. **Vertices and Edges**: \n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(1, 2), (1, 8), (2, 3), (3, 4), (8, 9)]\n\n2. **Graph Structure**:\n   - Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 2 and 8.\n   - Vertex 2 is connected to vertices 1 and 3.\n   - Vertex 3 is connected to vertices 2 and 4.\n   - Vertex 4 is connected to vertex 3.\n   - Vertex 8 is connected to vertices 1 and 9.\n   - Vertex 9 is connected to vertex 8.\n\n3. **Coloring Strategy**:\n   - We will start coloring from vertex 1 and proceed to its adjacent vertices, ensuring no two connected vertices have the same color.\n   - We will use colors 1, 2, and 3.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Coloring**:\n   - **Vertex 1**: Assign color 1.\n   - **Vertex 2**: Adjacent to vertex 1 (color 1), so assign color 2.\n   - **Vertex 3**: Adjacent to vertex 2 (color 2), so assign color 1.\n   - **Vertex 4**: Adjacent to vertex 3 (color 1), so assign color 2.\n   - **Vertex 8**: Adjacent to vertex 1 (color 1), so assign color 2.\n   - **Vertex 9**: Adjacent to vertex 8 (color 2), so assign color 1.\n   - **Vertices 0, 5, 6, 7**: These vertices are isolated (no edges), so they can be assigned any color. We will assign color 1 for simplicity.\n\n5. **Final Coloring**:\n   - Vertex 0: Color 1\n   - Vertex 1: Color 1\n   - Vertex 2: Color 2\n   - Vertex 3: Color 1\n   - Vertex 4: Color 2\n   - Vertex 5: Color 1\n   - Vertex 6: Color 1\n   - Vertex 7: Color 1\n   - Vertex 8: Color 2\n   - Vertex 9: Color 1\n\nThe final coloring ensures that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nThe solution in JSON format is:\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 2, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 2, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 2, \"9\": 1}>>>"
