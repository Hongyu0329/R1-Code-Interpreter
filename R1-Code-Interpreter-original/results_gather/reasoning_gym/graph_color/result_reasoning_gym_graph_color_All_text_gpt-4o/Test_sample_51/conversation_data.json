    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have 10 vertices and 6 edges, and we can use up to 3 different colors.\n\nLet's analyze the graph step by step:\n\n1. **Vertices and Edges**: \n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(0, 4), (0, 8), (2, 4), (2, 5), (5, 8), (6, 9)]\n\n2. **Graph Structure**:\n   - Vertex 0 is connected to vertices 4 and 8.\n   - Vertex 2 is connected to vertices 4 and 5.\n   - Vertex 5 is connected to vertex 8.\n   - Vertex 6 is connected to vertex 9.\n   - Vertices 1, 3, 7, and 9 are isolated in terms of the given edges, meaning they have no connections.\n\n3. **Color Assignment Strategy**:\n   - Start with vertex 0 and assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 4 is adjacent to vertex 0, so assign it a different color, say color 2.\n   - Vertex 8 is also adjacent to vertex 0, so assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 2 is adjacent to vertex 4, so assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 5 is adjacent to vertex 2, so assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 5 is also adjacent to vertex 8, which already has color 2, so assign vertex 5 color 3.\n   - Vertex 6 is isolated from the rest of the graph, so assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 9 is adjacent to vertex 6, so assign it color 2.\n   - Vertices 1, 3, and 7 are isolated, so they can be assigned any color. For simplicity, assign them color 1.\n\n4. **Final Color Assignment**:\n   - Vertex 0: Color 1\n   - Vertex 1: Color 1\n   - Vertex 2: Color 1\n   - Vertex 3: Color 1\n   - Vertex 4: Color 2\n   - Vertex 5: Color 3\n   - Vertex 6: Color 1\n   - Vertex 7: Color 1\n   - Vertex 8: Color 2\n   - Vertex 9: Color 2\n\nThis coloring ensures that no two adjacent vertices share the same color, and all vertices are colored using the available colors.\n\nThe final JSON map of vertices to colors is:\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 2, \"5\": 3, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 2, \"9\": 2}>>>"
