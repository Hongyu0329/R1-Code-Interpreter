    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have 10 vertices and 5 edges, and we can use up to 3 different colors.\n\nLet's analyze the graph step by step:\n\n1. **Vertices and Edges**: \n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(0, 7), (0, 8), (3, 8), (4, 5), (5, 7)]\n\n2. **Graph Structure**:\n   - Vertex 0 is connected to vertices 7 and 8.\n   - Vertex 3 is connected to vertex 8.\n   - Vertex 4 is connected to vertex 5.\n   - Vertex 5 is connected to vertex 7.\n\n3. **Color Assignment Strategy**:\n   - Start with vertex 0 and assign it the first color, say color 1.\n   - Assign colors to adjacent vertices (7 and 8) such that they are different from vertex 0.\n   - Continue this process for all vertices, ensuring no two connected vertices share the same color.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Coloring**:\n   - Assign color 1 to vertex 0.\n   - Vertex 7 is adjacent to vertex 0, so assign color 2 to vertex 7.\n   - Vertex 8 is adjacent to vertex 0, so assign color 2 to vertex 8.\n   - Vertex 3 is adjacent to vertex 8, so assign color 1 to vertex 3.\n   - Vertex 4 is not adjacent to any colored vertex, so assign color 1 to vertex 4.\n   - Vertex 5 is adjacent to vertex 4, so assign color 2 to vertex 5.\n   - Vertex 5 is also adjacent to vertex 7, which already has color 2, so we need to change the color of vertex 5 to color 3.\n   - Vertex 6 is not adjacent to any colored vertex, so assign color 1 to vertex 6.\n   - Vertex 9 is not adjacent to any colored vertex, so assign color 1 to vertex 9.\n\n5. **Final Coloring**:\n   - Vertex 0: Color 1\n   - Vertex 1: Color 1 (not connected to any other vertex)\n   - Vertex 2: Color 1 (not connected to any other vertex)\n   - Vertex 3: Color 1\n   - Vertex 4: Color 1\n   - Vertex 5: Color 3\n   - Vertex 6: Color 1\n   - Vertex 7: Color 2\n   - Vertex 8: Color 2\n   - Vertex 9: Color 1\n\nThe final coloring ensures that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. The JSON map of vertices to colors is:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 3, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 2, \"8\": 2, \"9\": 1}>>>"
