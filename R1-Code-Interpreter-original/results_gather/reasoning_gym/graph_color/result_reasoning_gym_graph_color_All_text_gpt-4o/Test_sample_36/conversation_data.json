    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. The graph has 10 vertices and 3 edges, and we have 3 colors available. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the vertices and edges**: \n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(1, 7), (2, 4), (6, 7)]\n\n2. **Understand the constraints**:\n   - Vertices connected by an edge must have different colors.\n   - We have 3 colors to use: [1, 2, 3].\n\n3. **Plan the coloring**:\n   - Start by coloring the vertices connected by edges, ensuring they have different colors.\n   - Then, color the remaining vertices, which are not directly connected by edges, with any available color.\n\n4. **Color the vertices connected by edges**:\n   - For edge (1, 7), assign different colors to vertices 1 and 7. Let's choose color 1 for vertex 1 and color 2 for vertex 7.\n   - For edge (2, 4), assign different colors to vertices 2 and 4. Let's choose color 1 for vertex 2 and color 2 for vertex 4.\n   - For edge (6, 7), vertex 7 is already colored with color 2, so assign a different color to vertex 6. Let's choose color 1 for vertex 6.\n\n5. **Color the remaining vertices**:\n   - Vertices 0, 3, 5, 8, and 9 are not directly connected by any edges, so they can be colored with any of the available colors. For simplicity, assign color 1 to all of them.\n\n6. **Verify the solution**:\n   - Ensure that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. The edges (1, 7), (2, 4), and (6, 7) are satisfied with different colors for connected vertices.\n\n7. **Create the JSON map**:\n   - Assign the colors to each vertex and format the solution as a JSON map.\n\nThe final coloring solution is:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 2, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 2, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 1}>>>"
