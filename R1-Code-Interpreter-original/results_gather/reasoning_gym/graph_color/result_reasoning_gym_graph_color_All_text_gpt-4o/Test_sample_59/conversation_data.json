    "To solve the problem of coloring the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color, we need to carefully analyze the given graph properties and constraints. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Graph Structure:**\n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(1, 8), (7, 8)]\n\n2. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - We have 10 vertices and only 2 edges.\n   - The edges indicate that vertex 1 is connected to vertex 8, and vertex 7 is connected to vertex 8.\n   - We need to ensure that connected vertices (1 and 8, 7 and 8) do not share the same color.\n\n3. **Available Colors:**\n   - Possible colors are [1, 2, 3].\n\n4. **Coloring Strategy:**\n   - Since there are only two edges, the graph is quite sparse, and most vertices are not directly connected.\n   - We can start by coloring the connected vertices with different colors and then assign any color to the remaining vertices, as they are not connected to each other.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Coloring:**\n   - Assign color 1 to vertex 1.\n   - Assign color 2 to vertex 8 (since it is connected to vertex 1).\n   - Assign color 3 to vertex 7 (since it is connected to vertex 8, and we want to use a different color than 2).\n   - The remaining vertices (0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9) are not connected to any other vertices, so they can be assigned any of the available colors. For simplicity, we can assign them color 1.\n\n6. **Final Coloring:**\n   - Vertex 0: Color 1\n   - Vertex 1: Color 1\n   - Vertex 2: Color 1\n   - Vertex 3: Color 1\n   - Vertex 4: Color 1\n   - Vertex 5: Color 1\n   - Vertex 6: Color 1\n   - Vertex 7: Color 3\n   - Vertex 8: Color 2\n   - Vertex 9: Color 1\n\n7. **Output the Solution:**\n   - The solution should be presented as a JSON map of vertices to colors.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 3, \"8\": 2, \"9\": 1}>>>"
