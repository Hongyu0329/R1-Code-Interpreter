    "To solve the problem of coloring the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color, we need to carefully analyze the given graph properties and constraints. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Graph Structure:**\n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(0, 9), (2, 4), (3, 9), (5, 6), (6, 7)]\n\n2. **Understand the Coloring Constraint:**\n   - We have three possible colors: [1, 2, 3].\n   - The goal is to assign a color to each vertex such that no two vertices connected by an edge have the same color.\n\n3. **Analyze the Graph:**\n   - The graph is sparse, with only a few edges connecting the vertices.\n   - Each edge represents a constraint where the two vertices at the ends of the edge must have different colors.\n\n4. **Plan the Coloring:**\n   - Start by coloring the vertices connected by edges, ensuring that adjacent vertices have different colors.\n   - Use the available colors [1, 2, 3] to ensure no two connected vertices share the same color.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Coloring:**\n   - Edge (0, 9): Assign color 1 to vertex 0 and color 2 to vertex 9.\n   - Edge (2, 4): Assign color 1 to vertex 2 and color 2 to vertex 4.\n   - Edge (3, 9): Vertex 9 is already colored 2, so assign color 1 to vertex 3.\n   - Edge (5, 6): Assign color 1 to vertex 5 and color 2 to vertex 6.\n   - Edge (6, 7): Vertex 6 is already colored 2, so assign color 1 to vertex 7.\n\n6. **Color Remaining Vertices:**\n   - Vertices 1 and 8 are not connected by any edges, so they can be assigned any color. Assign color 1 to both for simplicity.\n\n7. **Verify the Solution:**\n   - Check each edge to ensure that the connected vertices have different colors. The coloring should satisfy all constraints.\n\n8. **Final Coloring:**\n   - Vertex 0: Color 1\n   - Vertex 1: Color 1\n   - Vertex 2: Color 1\n   - Vertex 3: Color 1\n   - Vertex 4: Color 2\n   - Vertex 5: Color 1\n   - Vertex 6: Color 2\n   - Vertex 7: Color 1\n   - Vertex 8: Color 1\n   - Vertex 9: Color 2\n\nThe final solution is represented as a JSON map of vertices to colors:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 2, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 2}>>>"
