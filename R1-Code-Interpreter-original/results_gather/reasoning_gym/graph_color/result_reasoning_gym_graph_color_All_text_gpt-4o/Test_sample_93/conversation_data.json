    "To solve the problem of coloring the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Graph Structure**: \n   - We have 10 vertices: 0 through 9.\n   - The edges are: (0, 8), (3, 9), and (4, 7). This means:\n     - Vertex 0 is connected to vertex 8.\n     - Vertex 3 is connected to vertex 9.\n     - Vertex 4 is connected to vertex 7.\n\n2. **Identify the Coloring Constraint**:\n   - We need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two vertices connected by an edge have the same color.\n   - We have three possible colors: 1, 2, and 3.\n\n3. **Plan the Coloring**:\n   - Start by coloring the vertices connected by edges, as they have constraints.\n   - For each pair of connected vertices, assign different colors.\n   - Use the remaining color for any uncolored vertices, ensuring no conflicts.\n\n4. **Color the Graph**:\n   - Assign color 1 to vertex 0 and color 2 to vertex 8 (since they are connected).\n   - Assign color 1 to vertex 3 and color 2 to vertex 9 (since they are connected).\n   - Assign color 1 to vertex 4 and color 2 to vertex 7 (since they are connected).\n   - For the remaining vertices (1, 2, 5, 6), since they are not connected to any other vertices, we can assign them any color. To keep it simple, assign color 1 to all of them.\n\n5. **Verify the Solution**:\n   - Check that no two connected vertices share the same color:\n     - (0, 8): 0 is color 1, 8 is color 2.\n     - (3, 9): 3 is color 1, 9 is color 2.\n     - (4, 7): 4 is color 1, 7 is color 2.\n   - All constraints are satisfied.\n\n6. **Output the Solution**:\n   - Create a JSON map of vertices to colors.\n\nThe final coloring of the graph is:\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 2, \"8\": 2, \"9\": 2}>>>"
