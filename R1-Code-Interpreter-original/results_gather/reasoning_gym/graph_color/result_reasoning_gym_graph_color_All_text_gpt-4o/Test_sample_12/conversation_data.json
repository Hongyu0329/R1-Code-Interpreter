    "To solve the problem of coloring the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Graph Structure**: \n   - We have 10 vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n   - There are only two edges: (3, 7) and (4, 8).\n   - This means that most vertices are isolated and do not have any edges connecting them to other vertices.\n\n2. **Identify the Constraints**:\n   - Vertices 3 and 7 are connected, so they must have different colors.\n   - Vertices 4 and 8 are connected, so they must also have different colors.\n   - All other vertices (0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 9) are isolated and can be colored with any of the available colors.\n\n3. **Choose Colors for Connected Vertices**:\n   - For the edge (3, 7), we can choose any two different colors from the available colors [1, 2, 3]. Let's assign color 1 to vertex 3 and color 2 to vertex 7.\n   - For the edge (4, 8), we can similarly choose any two different colors. Let's assign color 1 to vertex 4 and color 2 to vertex 8.\n\n4. **Assign Colors to Isolated Vertices**:\n   - Since vertices 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, and 9 are isolated, they can be assigned any color. For simplicity, we can assign them all the same color, say color 1.\n\n5. **Construct the JSON Map**:\n   - Based on the above assignments, we construct the JSON map of vertices to colors.\n\nFollowing these steps, the coloring of the graph can be represented as:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 2, \"8\": 2, \"9\": 1}>>>"
