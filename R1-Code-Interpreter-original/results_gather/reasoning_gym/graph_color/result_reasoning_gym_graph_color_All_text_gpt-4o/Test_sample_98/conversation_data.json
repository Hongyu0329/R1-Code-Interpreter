    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have 10 vertices and 4 edges, and we can use up to 3 different colors.\n\nLet's analyze the graph step by step:\n\n1. **Vertices and Edges**: \n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(0, 5), (2, 5), (5, 9), (8, 9)]\n\n2. **Graph Structure**:\n   - Vertex 5 is connected to vertices 0, 2, and 9.\n   - Vertex 9 is connected to vertices 5 and 8.\n   - Vertices 0, 2, and 8 are each connected to one other vertex.\n\n3. **Color Assignment Strategy**:\n   - Start by coloring vertex 5, which has the highest degree (3 connections).\n   - Assign a color to vertex 5, then ensure that its adjacent vertices (0, 2, 9) receive different colors.\n   - Continue coloring the remaining vertices, ensuring no two connected vertices share the same color.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Coloring**:\n   - Color vertex 5 with color 1.\n   - Vertex 0 is connected to vertex 5, so color vertex 0 with color 2.\n   - Vertex 2 is connected to vertex 5, so color vertex 2 with color 2.\n   - Vertex 9 is connected to vertex 5, so color vertex 9 with color 2.\n   - Vertex 8 is connected to vertex 9, so color vertex 8 with color 1 (different from vertex 9).\n   - Vertices 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7 are not connected to any other vertices, so they can be colored with any available color. For simplicity, assign them color 1.\n\n5. **Final Coloring**:\n   - Vertex 0: Color 2\n   - Vertex 1: Color 1\n   - Vertex 2: Color 2\n   - Vertex 3: Color 1\n   - Vertex 4: Color 1\n   - Vertex 5: Color 1\n   - Vertex 6: Color 1\n   - Vertex 7: Color 1\n   - Vertex 8: Color 1\n   - Vertex 9: Color 2\n\nThe final coloring ensures that no two adjacent vertices share the same color, and all vertices are colored using the available colors.\n\nThe solution in JSON format is:\n<<<{\"0\": 2, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 2, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 2}>>>"
