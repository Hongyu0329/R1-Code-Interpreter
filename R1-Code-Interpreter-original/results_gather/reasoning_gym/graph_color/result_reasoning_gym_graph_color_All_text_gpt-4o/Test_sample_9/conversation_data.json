    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have 10 vertices and 9 edges, and we can use up to 3 different colors.\n\nLet's analyze the graph step by step:\n\n1. **Vertices and Edges**: \n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(1, 2), (1, 5), (3, 5), (3, 9), (4, 5), (5, 7), (6, 8), (7, 9), (8, 9)]\n\n2. **Graph Structure**:\n   - Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 2 and 5.\n   - Vertex 3 is connected to vertices 5 and 9.\n   - Vertex 4 is connected to vertex 5.\n   - Vertex 5 is connected to vertices 1, 3, 4, and 7.\n   - Vertex 6 is connected to vertex 8.\n   - Vertex 7 is connected to vertices 5 and 9.\n   - Vertex 8 is connected to vertices 6 and 9.\n   - Vertex 9 is connected to vertices 3, 7, and 8.\n\n3. **Color Assignment Strategy**:\n   - Start with vertex 0, which is isolated, so it can be any color. Let's assign color 1.\n   - Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 2 and 5. Assign color 1 to vertex 1.\n   - Vertex 2 is connected to vertex 1, so it cannot be color 1. Assign color 2 to vertex 2.\n   - Vertex 3 is connected to vertices 5 and 9. Assign color 1 to vertex 3.\n   - Vertex 4 is connected to vertex 5. Assign color 1 to vertex 4.\n   - Vertex 5 is connected to vertices 1, 3, 4, and 7. It cannot be color 1. Assign color 2 to vertex 5.\n   - Vertex 6 is connected to vertex 8. Assign color 1 to vertex 6.\n   - Vertex 7 is connected to vertices 5 and 9. It cannot be color 2. Assign color 1 to vertex 7.\n   - Vertex 8 is connected to vertices 6 and 9. It cannot be color 1. Assign color 2 to vertex 8.\n   - Vertex 9 is connected to vertices 3, 7, and 8. It cannot be color 1 or 2. Assign color 3 to vertex 9.\n\n4. **Final Color Assignment**:\n   - Vertex 0: Color 1\n   - Vertex 1: Color 1\n   - Vertex 2: Color 2\n   - Vertex 3: Color 1\n   - Vertex 4: Color 1\n   - Vertex 5: Color 2\n   - Vertex 6: Color 1\n   - Vertex 7: Color 1\n   - Vertex 8: Color 2\n   - Vertex 9: Color 3\n\nThe final coloring ensures that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. The solution is:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 2, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 2, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 2, \"9\": 3}>>>"
