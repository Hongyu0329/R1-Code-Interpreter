    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have three possible colors to use: 1, 2, and 3. Let's analyze the graph step by step:\n\n1. **Vertices and Edges**: \n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(0, 1), (1, 2), (1, 6), (4, 6), (5, 6)]\n\n2. **Graph Structure**:\n   - Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 0, 2, and 6.\n   - Vertex 6 is connected to vertices 1, 4, and 5.\n   - Other vertices (3, 7, 8, 9) are isolated and have no connections.\n\n3. **Coloring Strategy**:\n   - Start with vertex 0 and assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 1 is adjacent to vertex 0, so it cannot be color 1. Assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 2 is adjacent to vertex 1, so it cannot be color 2. Assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 6 is adjacent to vertex 1, so it cannot be color 2. Assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 4 is adjacent to vertex 6, so it cannot be color 1. Assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 5 is adjacent to vertex 6, so it cannot be color 1. Assign it color 2.\n   - Vertices 3, 7, 8, and 9 are isolated, so they can be assigned any color. Assign them color 1 for simplicity.\n\n4. **Final Coloring**:\n   - Vertex 0: Color 1\n   - Vertex 1: Color 2\n   - Vertex 2: Color 1\n   - Vertex 3: Color 1\n   - Vertex 4: Color 2\n   - Vertex 5: Color 2\n   - Vertex 6: Color 1\n   - Vertex 7: Color 1\n   - Vertex 8: Color 1\n   - Vertex 9: Color 1\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - Check each edge to ensure no two connected vertices have the same color:\n     - (0, 1): Colors 1 and 2\n     - (1, 2): Colors 2 and 1\n     - (1, 6): Colors 2 and 1\n     - (4, 6): Colors 2 and 1\n     - (5, 6): Colors 2 and 1\n   - All conditions are satisfied.\n\nThe final coloring of the graph is:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 2, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 2, \"5\": 2, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 1}>>>"
