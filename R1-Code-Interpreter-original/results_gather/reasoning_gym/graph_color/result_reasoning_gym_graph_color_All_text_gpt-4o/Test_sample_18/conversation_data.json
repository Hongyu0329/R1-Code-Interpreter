    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have 10 vertices and 5 edges, and we can use 3 different colors. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the vertices and edges:**\n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(1, 4), (1, 7), (2, 5), (2, 7), (3, 6)]\n\n2. **Understand the constraints:**\n   - Each vertex must be assigned one of the colors [1, 2, 3].\n   - No two vertices connected by an edge can have the same color.\n\n3. **Plan the coloring:**\n   - Start with a vertex and assign it a color.\n   - Move to an adjacent vertex and assign it a different color.\n   - Continue this process, ensuring no two connected vertices share the same color.\n\n4. **Assign colors:**\n   - Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 4 and 7. Assign color 1 to vertex 1.\n   - Vertex 4 is connected to vertex 1. Assign color 2 to vertex 4.\n   - Vertex 7 is connected to vertices 1 and 2. Assign color 2 to vertex 7.\n   - Vertex 2 is connected to vertices 5 and 7. Assign color 1 to vertex 2.\n   - Vertex 5 is connected to vertex 2. Assign color 2 to vertex 5.\n   - Vertex 3 is connected to vertex 6. Assign color 1 to vertex 3.\n   - Vertex 6 is connected to vertex 3. Assign color 2 to vertex 6.\n   - Vertices 0, 8, and 9 are not connected to any other vertices, so they can be assigned any color. Assign color 1 to vertex 0, color 1 to vertex 8, and color 1 to vertex 9.\n\n5. **Verify the solution:**\n   - Check each edge to ensure no two connected vertices have the same color:\n     - (1, 4): Colors are 1 and 2.\n     - (1, 7): Colors are 1 and 2.\n     - (2, 5): Colors are 1 and 2.\n     - (2, 7): Colors are 1 and 2.\n     - (3, 6): Colors are 1 and 2.\n   - All constraints are satisfied.\n\n6. **Output the solution:**\n   - Create a JSON map of vertices to colors.\n\nThe final coloring solution is:\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 2, \"5\": 2, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 2, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 1}>>>"
