    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have 10 vertices and 4 edges, and we can use 3 different colors. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the vertices and edges**: \n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(0, 1), (1, 7), (2, 8), (5, 9)]\n\n2. **Understand the constraints**:\n   - Vertices connected by an edge must have different colors.\n   - We have 3 colors available: [1, 2, 3].\n\n3. **Plan the coloring**:\n   - Start with vertex 0 and assign it the first color, say color 1.\n   - Vertex 1 is connected to vertex 0, so it cannot be color 1. Assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 7 is connected to vertex 1, so it cannot be color 2. Assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 2 is not connected to any colored vertex yet, so assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 8 is connected to vertex 2, so it cannot be color 1. Assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 5 is not connected to any colored vertex yet, so assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 9 is connected to vertex 5, so it cannot be color 1. Assign it color 2.\n   - Vertices 3, 4, and 6 are not connected to any other vertices, so they can be assigned any color. Assign them color 1.\n\n4. **Verify the solution**:\n   - Check each edge to ensure no two connected vertices have the same color:\n     - Edge (0, 1): Colors are 1 and 2.\n     - Edge (1, 7): Colors are 2 and 1.\n     - Edge (2, 8): Colors are 1 and 2.\n     - Edge (5, 9): Colors are 1 and 2.\n   - All constraints are satisfied.\n\n5. **Create the JSON map**:\n   - Assign the colors to each vertex as determined.\n\nThe final coloring of the graph is:\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 2, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 2, \"9\": 2}>>>"
