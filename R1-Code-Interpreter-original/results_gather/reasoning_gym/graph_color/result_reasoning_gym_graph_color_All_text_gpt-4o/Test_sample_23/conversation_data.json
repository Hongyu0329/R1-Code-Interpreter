    "To solve the problem of coloring the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Graph Structure**: \n   - We have 10 vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n   - The edges are: (0, 5), (0, 7), (2, 3), (2, 7), (3, 5), (4, 7).\n   - This means vertex 0 is connected to vertices 5 and 7, vertex 2 is connected to vertices 3 and 7, and so on.\n\n2. **Identify the Coloring Constraint**:\n   - We need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two connected vertices have the same color.\n   - We have three possible colors: 1, 2, and 3.\n\n3. **Plan the Coloring**:\n   - Start with a vertex and assign it a color.\n   - Move to an adjacent vertex and assign it a different color.\n   - Continue this process, ensuring that no two connected vertices share the same color.\n\n4. **Color the Graph**:\n   - Start with vertex 0 and assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 0 is connected to vertices 5 and 7. Assign vertex 5 color 2 and vertex 7 color 3.\n   - Vertex 2 is not connected to vertex 0, so it can also be assigned color 1.\n   - Vertex 2 is connected to vertices 3 and 7. Assign vertex 3 color 2 (since vertex 7 is already color 3).\n   - Vertex 4 is not connected to any colored vertex yet, so assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 4 is connected to vertex 7, which is color 3, so this is valid.\n   - Vertices 1, 6, 8, and 9 are not connected to any other vertices, so they can be assigned any color. Assign them color 1 for simplicity.\n\n5. **Verify the Coloring**:\n   - Check each edge to ensure no two connected vertices have the same color.\n   - (0, 5): colors are 1 and 2.\n   - (0, 7): colors are 1 and 3.\n   - (2, 3): colors are 1 and 2.\n   - (2, 7): colors are 1 and 3.\n   - (3, 5): colors are 2 and 2 (this needs correction, so assign vertex 3 color 3 instead).\n   - (4, 7): colors are 1 and 3.\n\n6. **Correct the Coloring**:\n   - Reassign vertex 3 to color 3 to resolve the conflict with vertex 5.\n\n7. **Final Coloring**:\n   - Vertex 0: color 1\n   - Vertex 1: color 1\n   - Vertex 2: color 1\n   - Vertex 3: color 3\n   - Vertex 4: color 1\n   - Vertex 5: color 2\n   - Vertex 6: color 1\n   - Vertex 7: color 3\n   - Vertex 8: color 1\n   - Vertex 9: color 1\n\nThe final solution is:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 3, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 2, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 3, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 1}>>>"
