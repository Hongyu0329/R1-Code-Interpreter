    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. The graph is defined by its vertices and edges, and we have three possible colors to use.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Graph Structure:**\n   - **Vertices:** [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - **Edges:** [(0, 4), (1, 8), (2, 8)]\n\n2. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - Vertices connected by an edge must have different colors.\n   - We have three colors available: [1, 2, 3].\n\n3. **Analyze the Edges:**\n   - **Edge (0, 4):** Vertex 0 and Vertex 4 must have different colors.\n   - **Edge (1, 8):** Vertex 1 and Vertex 8 must have different colors.\n   - **Edge (2, 8):** Vertex 2 and Vertex 8 must have different colors.\n\n4. **Assign Colors:**\n   - Start with Vertex 0. Assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 4 is connected to Vertex 0, so it cannot be color 1. Assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 1 can be assigned color 1 (since it is not connected to Vertex 0 or 4).\n   - Vertex 8 is connected to Vertex 1, so it cannot be color 1. Assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 2 is connected to Vertex 8, so it cannot be color 2. Assign it color 1.\n   - Vertices 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9 are not connected to any other vertices, so they can be assigned any color. Assign them color 1 for simplicity.\n\n5. **Verify the Solution:**\n   - Check each edge to ensure no two connected vertices share the same color:\n     - Edge (0, 4): Colors are 1 and 2 (different).\n     - Edge (1, 8): Colors are 1 and 2 (different).\n     - Edge (2, 8): Colors are 1 and 2 (different).\n\n6. **Construct the JSON Map:**\n   - Create a JSON map of vertices to their assigned colors.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe coloring of the graph is as follows:\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 2, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 2, \"9\": 1}>>>"
