    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have three colors available: 1, 2, and 3. Let's analyze the graph step by step:\n\n1. **Vertices and Edges**: \n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(0, 2), (0, 3), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 9)]\n\n2. **Graph Structure**:\n   - Vertex 0 is connected to vertices 2 and 3.\n   - Vertex 2 is connected to vertices 0 and 5.\n   - Vertex 3 is connected to vertices 0 and 5.\n   - Vertex 5 is connected to vertices 2 and 3.\n   - Vertex 4 is connected to vertex 9.\n\n3. **Coloring Strategy**:\n   - Start with vertex 0 and assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 2 is adjacent to vertex 0, so it cannot be color 1. Assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 3 is also adjacent to vertex 0, so it cannot be color 1. Assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 5 is adjacent to vertices 2 and 3, both of which are color 2, so assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 4 is not adjacent to any colored vertex yet, so assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 9 is adjacent to vertex 4, which is color 1, so assign it color 2.\n   - Vertices 1, 6, 7, and 8 are not connected to any other vertices, so they can be assigned any color. Assign them color 1 for simplicity.\n\n4. **Final Coloring**:\n   - Vertex 0: Color 1\n   - Vertex 1: Color 1\n   - Vertex 2: Color 2\n   - Vertex 3: Color 2\n   - Vertex 4: Color 1\n   - Vertex 5: Color 1\n   - Vertex 6: Color 1\n   - Vertex 7: Color 1\n   - Vertex 8: Color 1\n   - Vertex 9: Color 2\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - Check each edge to ensure no two connected vertices share the same color:\n     - (0, 2): Colors 1 and 2\n     - (0, 3): Colors 1 and 2\n     - (2, 5): Colors 2 and 1\n     - (3, 5): Colors 2 and 1\n     - (4, 9): Colors 1 and 2\n   - All conditions are satisfied.\n\nThe final coloring of the graph is:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 2, \"3\": 2, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 2}>>>"
