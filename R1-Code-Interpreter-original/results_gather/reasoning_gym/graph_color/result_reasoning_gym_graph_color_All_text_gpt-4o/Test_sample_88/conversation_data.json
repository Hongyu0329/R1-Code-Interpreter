    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have 10 vertices and 4 edges, and we can use 3 different colors. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the vertices and edges:**\n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(0, 6), (2, 9), (4, 9), (5, 6)]\n\n2. **Understand the constraints:**\n   - Each vertex must be colored such that no two vertices connected by an edge have the same color.\n   - We have 3 colors available: [1, 2, 3].\n\n3. **Plan the coloring:**\n   - Start by coloring the vertices connected by edges, as these have constraints.\n   - Then, color the remaining vertices, which are not directly connected by edges, ensuring no conflicts arise.\n\n4. **Color the vertices:**\n   - Edge (0, 6): Assign color 1 to vertex 0 and color 2 to vertex 6.\n   - Edge (2, 9): Assign color 1 to vertex 2 and color 2 to vertex 9.\n   - Edge (4, 9): Vertex 9 is already colored with 2, so assign color 1 to vertex 4.\n   - Edge (5, 6): Vertex 6 is already colored with 2, so assign color 1 to vertex 5.\n\n5. **Color the remaining vertices:**\n   - Vertices 1, 3, 7, and 8 are not directly connected by any edges, so they can be colored with any of the available colors. To minimize potential conflicts, assign them a different color from their neighbors:\n     - Assign color 3 to vertices 1, 3, 7, and 8.\n\n6. **Verify the solution:**\n   - Check each edge to ensure no two connected vertices share the same color:\n     - (0, 6): Colors are 1 and 2.\n     - (2, 9): Colors are 1 and 2.\n     - (4, 9): Colors are 1 and 2.\n     - (5, 6): Colors are 1 and 2.\n   - All constraints are satisfied.\n\n7. **Output the solution:**\n   - Create a JSON map of vertices to colors.\n\nThe final coloring solution is:\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 3, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 3, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 3, \"8\": 3, \"9\": 2}>>>"
