    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have 10 vertices and 7 edges, and we can use up to 3 different colors.\n\nLet's analyze the graph step by step:\n\n1. **Vertices and Edges**: \n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(0, 6), (0, 8), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 8), (5, 6), (5, 8)]\n\n2. **Graph Structure**:\n   - Vertex 0 is connected to vertices 6 and 8.\n   - Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 4, 6, and 8.\n   - Vertex 5 is connected to vertices 6 and 8.\n   - Vertices 2, 3, 7, and 9 are isolated (not connected to any other vertices).\n\n3. **Color Assignment Strategy**:\n   - Start with vertex 0 and assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 6 is adjacent to vertex 0, so assign it a different color, say color 2.\n   - Vertex 8 is adjacent to vertex 0, so assign it a different color, say color 3.\n   - Vertex 1 is adjacent to vertices 4, 6, and 8. Assign it color 1 (since 6 and 8 are already colored with 2 and 3).\n   - Vertex 4 is adjacent to vertex 1, so assign it a different color, say color 2.\n   - Vertex 5 is adjacent to vertices 6 and 8. Assign it color 1 (since 6 and 8 are already colored with 2 and 3).\n   - Vertices 2, 3, 7, and 9 are isolated, so they can be assigned any color. For simplicity, assign them color 1.\n\n4. **Final Coloring**:\n   - Vertex 0: Color 1\n   - Vertex 1: Color 1\n   - Vertex 2: Color 1\n   - Vertex 3: Color 1\n   - Vertex 4: Color 2\n   - Vertex 5: Color 1\n   - Vertex 6: Color 2\n   - Vertex 7: Color 1\n   - Vertex 8: Color 3\n   - Vertex 9: Color 1\n\nThe coloring ensures that no two adjacent vertices share the same color, and all vertices are colored using the available colors.\n\nFinal answer in JSON format:\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 2, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 3, \"9\": 1}>>>"
