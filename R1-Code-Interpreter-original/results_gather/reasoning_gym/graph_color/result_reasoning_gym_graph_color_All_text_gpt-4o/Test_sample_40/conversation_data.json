    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have 10 vertices and 6 edges, and we can use up to 3 different colors.\n\nLet's analyze the graph step by step:\n\n1. **Vertices and Edges**: \n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(1, 6), (1, 9), (2, 3), (5, 7), (5, 9), (6, 7)]\n\n2. **Graph Structure**:\n   - Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 6 and 9.\n   - Vertex 2 is connected to vertex 3.\n   - Vertex 5 is connected to vertices 7 and 9.\n   - Vertex 6 is connected to vertex 7.\n\n3. **Color Assignment Strategy**:\n   - We will start by coloring the vertices with the highest degree (most connections) first, as they are more constrained.\n   - We will use the smallest available color for each vertex.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Coloring**:\n   - **Vertex 1**: Connected to 6 and 9. Assign color 1 to vertex 1.\n   - **Vertex 6**: Connected to 1 and 7. Vertex 1 is color 1, so assign color 2 to vertex 6.\n   - **Vertex 9**: Connected to 1 and 5. Vertex 1 is color 1, so assign color 2 to vertex 9.\n   - **Vertex 5**: Connected to 7 and 9. Vertex 9 is color 2, so assign color 1 to vertex 5.\n   - **Vertex 7**: Connected to 5 and 6. Vertex 5 is color 1 and vertex 6 is color 2, so assign color 3 to vertex 7.\n   - **Vertex 2**: Connected to 3. Assign color 1 to vertex 2.\n   - **Vertex 3**: Connected to 2. Vertex 2 is color 1, so assign color 2 to vertex 3.\n   - **Vertices 0, 4, 8**: These vertices are isolated (no connections), so they can be assigned any color. Assign color 1 to each for simplicity.\n\n5. **Final Coloring**:\n   - Vertex 0: Color 1\n   - Vertex 1: Color 1\n   - Vertex 2: Color 1\n   - Vertex 3: Color 2\n   - Vertex 4: Color 1\n   - Vertex 5: Color 1\n   - Vertex 6: Color 2\n   - Vertex 7: Color 3\n   - Vertex 8: Color 1\n   - Vertex 9: Color 2\n\nThe final coloring ensures that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nThe solution in JSON format is:\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 2, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 3, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 2}>>>"
