    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have 10 vertices and 6 edges, and we can use up to 3 different colors.\n\nLet's analyze the graph step by step:\n\n1. **Vertices and Edges**: \n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(0, 2), (0, 5), (1, 2), (1, 9), (2, 6), (5, 9)]\n\n2. **Graph Structure**:\n   - Vertex 0 is connected to vertices 2 and 5.\n   - Vertex 1 is connected to vertices 2 and 9.\n   - Vertex 2 is connected to vertices 0, 1, and 6.\n   - Vertex 5 is connected to vertices 0 and 9.\n   - Vertex 6 is connected to vertex 2.\n   - Vertex 9 is connected to vertices 1 and 5.\n\n3. **Color Assignment Strategy**:\n   - Start with vertex 0 and assign it the first color, say color 1.\n   - Move to vertex 2, which is connected to vertex 0, so assign it a different color, say color 2.\n   - Vertex 5 is also connected to vertex 0, so assign it color 2.\n   - Vertex 1 is connected to vertex 2, so assign it a different color from vertex 2, say color 1.\n   - Vertex 9 is connected to vertex 1, so assign it a different color, say color 2.\n   - Vertex 6 is connected to vertex 2, so assign it a different color, say color 1.\n   - Vertices 3, 4, 7, and 8 are not connected to any other vertices, so they can be assigned any color. For simplicity, assign them color 1.\n\n4. **Final Color Assignment**:\n   - Vertex 0: Color 1\n   - Vertex 1: Color 1\n   - Vertex 2: Color 2\n   - Vertex 3: Color 1\n   - Vertex 4: Color 1\n   - Vertex 5: Color 2\n   - Vertex 6: Color 1\n   - Vertex 7: Color 1\n   - Vertex 8: Color 1\n   - Vertex 9: Color 2\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - Check each edge to ensure no two connected vertices have the same color:\n     - (0, 2): Colors 1 and 2\n     - (0, 5): Colors 1 and 2\n     - (1, 2): Colors 1 and 2\n     - (1, 9): Colors 1 and 2\n     - (2, 6): Colors 2 and 1\n     - (5, 9): Colors 2 and 2 (This is incorrect, so we need to adjust)\n\n6. **Adjustment**:\n   - Reassign color to vertex 9 to color 3 to resolve the conflict with vertex 5.\n\n7. **Final Corrected Color Assignment**:\n   - Vertex 0: Color 1\n   - Vertex 1: Color 1\n   - Vertex 2: Color 2\n   - Vertex 3: Color 1\n   - Vertex 4: Color 1\n   - Vertex 5: Color 2\n   - Vertex 6: Color 1\n   - Vertex 7: Color 1\n   - Vertex 8: Color 1\n   - Vertex 9: Color 3\n\nThe final solution is:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 2, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 2, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 3}>>>"
