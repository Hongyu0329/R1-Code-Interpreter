    "To solve the problem of coloring the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Graph Structure**: \n   - We have 10 vertices: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n   - The edges are: (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 8), (3, 9), (4, 8), (5, 9).\n   - This means vertices 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 are involved in edges, while vertices 0, 1, and 6 are isolated.\n\n2. **Identify Isolated Vertices**:\n   - Vertices 0, 1, and 6 have no edges, so they can be assigned any color without restriction.\n\n3. **Color the Graph**:\n   - Start with vertices that have the most connections to ensure no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n   - Vertex 8 is connected to vertices 2, 3, and 4. Assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 2 is connected to vertices 7 and 8. Since 8 is color 1, assign 2 color 2.\n   - Vertex 3 is connected to vertices 8 and 9. Since 8 is color 1, assign 3 color 2.\n   - Vertex 4 is connected to vertex 8. Since 8 is color 1, assign 4 color 2.\n   - Vertex 5 is connected to vertex 9. Assign 5 color 1.\n   - Vertex 7 is connected to vertex 2. Since 2 is color 2, assign 7 color 1.\n   - Vertex 9 is connected to vertices 3 and 5. Since 3 is color 2 and 5 is color 1, assign 9 color 3.\n\n4. **Assign Colors to Isolated Vertices**:\n   - Vertices 0, 1, and 6 can be assigned any color. For simplicity, assign them color 1.\n\n5. **Verify the Coloring**:\n   - Ensure no two adjacent vertices share the same color. The assignments should satisfy this condition.\n\nThe final coloring of the graph is as follows:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 2, \"3\": 2, \"4\": 2, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 3}>>>"
