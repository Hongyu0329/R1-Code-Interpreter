    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have 10 vertices and 6 edges, and we can use up to 3 colors.\n\nLet's analyze the graph step by step:\n\n1. **Vertices and Edges**: \n   - Vertices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n   - Edges: [(0, 9), (2, 7), (2, 8), (3, 6), (3, 9), (7, 9)]\n\n2. **Graph Structure**:\n   - Vertex 0 is connected to vertex 9.\n   - Vertex 2 is connected to vertices 7 and 8.\n   - Vertex 3 is connected to vertices 6 and 9.\n   - Vertex 7 is connected to vertices 2 and 9.\n   - Vertex 9 is connected to vertices 0, 3, and 7.\n\n3. **Color Assignment Strategy**:\n   - Start with vertex 0 and assign it color 1.\n   - Vertex 9 is adjacent to vertex 0, so assign it a different color, say color 2.\n   - Vertex 2 is not adjacent to vertex 0 or 9, so it can be assigned color 1.\n   - Vertex 7 is adjacent to vertex 2, so assign it a different color, say color 2.\n   - Vertex 8 is adjacent to vertex 2, so assign it a different color, say color 2.\n   - Vertex 3 is not adjacent to vertex 0, 2, or 8, so it can be assigned color 1.\n   - Vertex 6 is adjacent to vertex 3, so assign it a different color, say color 2.\n   - Vertex 1 and vertex 4 are not adjacent to any colored vertices, so they can be assigned color 1.\n   - Vertex 5 is not adjacent to any colored vertices, so it can be assigned color 1.\n\n4. **Final Color Assignment**:\n   - Vertex 0: Color 1\n   - Vertex 1: Color 1\n   - Vertex 2: Color 1\n   - Vertex 3: Color 1\n   - Vertex 4: Color 1\n   - Vertex 5: Color 1\n   - Vertex 6: Color 2\n   - Vertex 7: Color 2\n   - Vertex 8: Color 2\n   - Vertex 9: Color 2\n\nThis assignment ensures that no two adjacent vertices share the same color, and we have used only two colors, which is within the allowed limit of three colors.\n\nThe final solution in JSON format is:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 2, \"8\": 2, \"9\": 2}>>>"
