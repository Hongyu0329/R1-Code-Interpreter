    "To solve the problem of coloring the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Graph Structure**: \n   - We have 10 vertices: 0 through 9.\n   - The edges are: (0, 6), (0, 7), (1, 7), (4, 7), (5, 7), (7, 8).\n   - This means vertex 7 is connected to vertices 0, 1, 4, 5, and 8, making it a central node with the highest degree.\n\n2. **Identify the Coloring Constraint**:\n   - We have 3 colors available: 1, 2, and 3.\n   - The goal is to assign colors to each vertex such that no two connected vertices have the same color.\n\n3. **Start Coloring**:\n   - Begin with vertex 7, as it has the highest degree. Assign it color 1.\n   - For vertices connected to 7 (i.e., 0, 1, 4, 5, 8), assign a different color than 1. We can use colors 2 and 3.\n\n4. **Assign Colors to Connected Vertices**:\n   - Assign color 2 to vertex 0.\n   - Assign color 3 to vertex 1.\n   - Assign color 2 to vertex 4.\n   - Assign color 3 to vertex 5.\n   - Assign color 2 to vertex 8.\n\n5. **Color Remaining Vertices**:\n   - Vertices 2, 3, 6, and 9 are not directly connected to vertex 7, so they can be colored with any of the available colors as long as they don't conflict with their direct connections.\n   - Assign color 1 to vertex 2.\n   - Assign color 1 to vertex 3.\n   - Assign color 3 to vertex 6 (since it is connected to vertex 0 which is colored 2).\n   - Assign color 1 to vertex 9.\n\n6. **Verify the Coloring**:\n   - Ensure no two adjacent vertices share the same color. Check each edge to confirm this.\n\nBy following these steps, we can ensure a valid coloring of the graph. The final coloring is:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 2, \"1\": 3, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 2, \"5\": 3, \"6\": 3, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 2, \"9\": 1}>>>"
