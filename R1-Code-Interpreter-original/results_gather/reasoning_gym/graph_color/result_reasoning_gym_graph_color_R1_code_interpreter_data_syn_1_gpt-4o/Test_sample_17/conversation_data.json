    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.

We'll iterate over each vertex and assign the smallest possible color that hasn't been used by its neighbors.\n\n```python\ndef graph_coloring(vertices, edges, colors):\n    # Initialize the color assignment dictionary\n    color_assignment = {vertex: None for vertex in vertices}\n    \n    # Create an adjacency list from the edges\n    adjacency_list = {vertex: [] for vertex in vertices}\n    for edge in edges:\n        adjacency_list[edge[0]].append(edge[1])\n        adjacency_list[edge[1]].append(edge[0])\n    \n    # Assign colors to each vertex\n    for vertex in vertices:\n        # Find the colors used by adjacent vertices\n        used_colors = {color_assignment[neighbor] for neighbor in adjacency_list[vertex] if color_assignment[neighbor] is not None}\n        \n        # Assign the smallest available color\n        for color in colors:\n            if color not in used_colors:\n                color_assignment[vertex] = color\n                break\n    \n    return color_assignment\n\n# Define the graph properties\nvertices = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\nedges = [(1, 2), (1, 8), (2, 3), (3, 4), (8, 9)]\ncolors = [1, 2, 3]\n\n# Get the color assignment\ncolor_assignment = graph_coloring(vertices, edges, colors)\nprint(color_assignment)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find a valid coloring for the graph.",
