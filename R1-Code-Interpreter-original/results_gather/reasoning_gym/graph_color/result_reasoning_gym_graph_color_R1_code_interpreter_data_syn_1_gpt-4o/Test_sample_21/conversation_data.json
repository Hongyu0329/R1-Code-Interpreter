    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. The graph has 10 vertices and 5 edges, and we have 3 colors available.\n\nThe approach to solve this problem is to use a greedy algorithm, which iteratively assigns the smallest possible color to each vertex. This is a simple and efficient method for graph coloring problems, especially when the graph is sparse and the number of colors is relatively small.\n\nLet's outline the steps:\n1. Initialize a dictionary to store the color of each vertex.\n2. Iterate over each vertex and assign the smallest color that is not used by its adjacent vertices.\n3. Ensure that no two connected vertices have the same color.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python to find a valid coloring for the graph.\n\n```python\ndef graph_coloring(vertices, edges, colors):\n    # Initialize the color map with None for each vertex\n    color_map = {vertex: None for vertex in vertices}\n    \n    # Create an adjacency list for the graph\n    adjacency_list = {vertex: [] for vertex in vertices}\n    for edge in edges:\n        adjacency_list[edge[0]].append(edge[1])\n        adjacency_list[edge[1]].append(edge[0])\n    \n    # Assign colors to each vertex\n    for vertex in vertices:\n        # Find the colors of adjacent vertices\n        adjacent_colors = {color_map[adj] for adj in adjacency_list[vertex] if color_map[adj] is not None}\n        \n        # Assign the smallest available color\n        for color in colors:\n            if color not in adjacent_colors:\n                color_map[vertex] = color\n                break\n    \n    return color_map\n\n# Define the graph properties\nvertices = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\nedges = [(0, 8), (2, 9), (3, 5), (6, 7), (7, 8)]\ncolors = [1, 2, 3]\n\n# Get the coloring solution\ncoloring_solution = graph_coloring(vertices, edges, colors)\n\n# Print the solution in the required format\nprint(coloring_solution)\n```\n\nThis code will output a valid coloring for the graph, ensuring that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
