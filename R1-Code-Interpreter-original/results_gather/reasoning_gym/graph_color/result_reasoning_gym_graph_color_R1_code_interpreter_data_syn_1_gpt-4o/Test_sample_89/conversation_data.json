    "To solve this problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. This is a classic graph coloring problem, and we can use a greedy algorithm to find a solution.\n\nGiven the vertices and edges, we can start by assigning colors to each vertex one by one, ensuring that no two connected vertices have the same color. Since the graph is sparse (only three edges), this should be straightforward.\n\nLet's outline the steps:\n1. Initialize a dictionary to store the color of each vertex.\n2. Iterate over each vertex and assign the smallest possible color that is not used by its adjacent vertices.\n3. Return the resulting color mapping.\n\nWe will implement this logic in Python to find a valid coloring for the graph.\n\n```python\n# Define the vertices and edges\nvertices = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\nedges = [(1, 2), (3, 9), (6, 8)]\ncolors = [1, 2, 3]\n\n# Initialize a dictionary to store the color of each vertex\nvertex_colors = {}\n\n# Function to find the smallest available color for a vertex\ndef find_color(vertex, edges, vertex_colors, colors):\n    # Find colors of adjacent vertices\n    adjacent_colors = set()\n    for edge in edges:\n        if edge[0] == vertex and edge[1] in vertex_colors:\n            adjacent_colors.add(vertex_colors[edge[1]])\n        elif edge[1] == vertex and edge[0] in vertex_colors:\n            adjacent_colors.add(vertex_colors[edge[0]])\n    \n    # Assign the smallest color not used by adjacent vertices\n    for color in colors:\n        if color not in adjacent_colors:\n            return color\n    return None\n\n# Assign colors to each vertex\nfor vertex in vertices:\n    vertex_colors[vertex] = find_color(vertex, edges, vertex_colors, colors)\n\n# Print the resulting color mapping\nprint(vertex_colors)\n```\n\nThis code will output a valid coloring for the graph. Let's execute it to see the result.",
