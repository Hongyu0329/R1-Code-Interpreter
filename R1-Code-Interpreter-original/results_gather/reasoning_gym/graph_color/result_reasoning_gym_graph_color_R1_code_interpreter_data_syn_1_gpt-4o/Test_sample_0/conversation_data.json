    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have 10 vertices and 7 edges, and we can use up to 3 colors.\n\nThe graph can be represented as an adjacency list:\n- 0: [5, 6, 9]\n- 1: []\n- 2: [9]\n- 3: []\n- 4: []\n- 5: [0, 9]\n- 6: [0, 7]\n- 7: [6, 8]\n- 8: [7]\n- 9: [0, 2, 5]\n\nWe can use a greedy algorithm to color the graph. The algorithm will iterate over each vertex and assign the smallest possible color that hasn't been used by its adjacent vertices.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef graph_coloring(vertices, edges, colors):\n    # Initialize the color assignment dictionary\n    color_assignment = {v: None for v in vertices}\n    \n    # Create an adjacency list\n    adjacency_list = {v: [] for v in vertices}\n    for edge in edges:\n        adjacency_list[edge[0]].append(edge[1])\n        adjacency_list[edge[1]].append(edge[0])\n    \n    # Assign colors to each vertex\n    for vertex in vertices:\n        # Find the colors of adjacent vertices\n        adjacent_colors = {color_assignment[adj] for adj in adjacency_list[vertex] if color_assignment[adj] is not None}\n        \n        # Assign the smallest possible color\n        for color in colors:\n            if color not in adjacent_colors:\n                color_assignment[vertex] = color\n                break\n    \n    return color_assignment\n\n# Define the graph properties\nvertices = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\nedges = [(0, 5), (0, 6), (0, 9), (2, 9), (5, 9), (6, 7), (7, 8)]\ncolors = [1, 2, 3]\n\n# Get the color assignment\ncolor_assignment = graph_coloring(vertices, edges, colors)\nprint(color_assignment)\n```\n\nThis code will output a valid coloring for the graph. Let's execute it to see the result.",
