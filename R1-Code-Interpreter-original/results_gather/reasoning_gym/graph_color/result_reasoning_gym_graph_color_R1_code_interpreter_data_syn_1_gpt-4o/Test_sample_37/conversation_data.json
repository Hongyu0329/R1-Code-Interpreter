    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. The graph has 10 vertices and 6 edges, and we have 3 possible colors to use.\n\nThe approach to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1. **Initialize Colors**: Start by initializing a dictionary to store the color of each vertex.\n2. **Assign Colors**: Iterate over each vertex and assign the smallest possible color that is not used by its adjacent vertices.\n3. **Check Constraints**: Ensure that no two connected vertices have the same color.\n\nLet's implement this logic using Python code to find a valid coloring for the graph.\n\n```python\ndef graph_coloring(vertices, edges, colors):\n    # Initialize the color assignment dictionary\n    color_assignment = {v: None for v in vertices}\n    \n    # Function to check if a color can be assigned to a vertex\n    def can_color(vertex, color):\n        for edge in edges:\n            if vertex in edge:\n                adjacent_vertex = edge[0] if edge[1] == vertex else edge[1]\n                if color_assignment[adjacent_vertex] == color:\n                    return False\n        return True\n    \n    # Assign colors to each vertex\n    for vertex in vertices:\n        for color in colors:\n            if can_color(vertex, color):\n                color_assignment[vertex] = color\n                break\n    \n    return color_assignment\n\n# Define the graph properties\nvertices = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\nedges = [(0, 1), (3, 8), (4, 7), (4, 8), (4, 9), (8, 9)]\ncolors = [1, 2, 3]\n\n# Get the color assignment\ncolor_assignment = graph_coloring(vertices, edges, colors)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(color_assignment)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to color the graph using the given constraints and print the resulting color assignment. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
