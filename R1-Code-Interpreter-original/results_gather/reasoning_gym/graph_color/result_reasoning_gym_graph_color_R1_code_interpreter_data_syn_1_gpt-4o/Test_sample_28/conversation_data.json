    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have three colors available: 1, 2, and 3. The graph has 10 vertices and 7 edges.\n\nThe approach to solve this problem is to use a greedy coloring algorithm. This algorithm assigns the smallest possible color to each vertex, ensuring that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. We will iterate over each vertex and assign a color that is not used by its adjacent vertices.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the graph properties\nvertices = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\nedges = [(0, 7), (0, 9), (1, 4), (2, 8), (4, 5), (7, 8), (8, 9)]\ncolors = [1, 2, 3]\n\n# Initialize the color assignment dictionary\ncolor_assignment = {vertex: None for vertex in vertices}\n\n# Function to find the smallest available color for a vertex\ndef find_smallest_color(vertex, edges, color_assignment, colors):\n    # Find the colors of adjacent vertices\n    adjacent_colors = set()\n    for edge in edges:\n        if vertex in edge:\n            adjacent_vertex = edge[0] if edge[1] == vertex else edge[1]\n            if color_assignment[adjacent_vertex] is not None:\n                adjacent_colors.add(color_assignment[adjacent_vertex])\n    \n    # Assign the smallest color that is not used by adjacent vertices\n    for color in colors:\n        if color not in adjacent_colors:\n            return color\n    return None\n\n# Assign colors to each vertex\nfor vertex in vertices:\n    color_assignment[vertex] = find_smallest_color(vertex, edges, color_assignment, colors)\n\n# Print the color assignment\nprint(color_assignment)\n```\n\nThis code will output a valid coloring for the graph. Let's execute it to see the result.",
