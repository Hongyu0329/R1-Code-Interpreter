    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. The graph has 10 vertices and 6 edges, and we have 3 possible colors to use.\n\nThe problem can be approached using a backtracking algorithm, which tries to assign colors to vertices one by one and backtracks if it finds a conflict. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Initialize the Graph**: We have 10 vertices and the edges are given. We need to represent this graph in a way that allows us to easily check adjacency.\n\n2. **Color Assignment**: We will try to assign one of the three colors to each vertex. We start with the first vertex and proceed to the next, checking if the current color assignment is valid (i.e., no two adjacent vertices have the same color).\n\n3. **Backtracking**: If we reach a vertex where no color can be assigned without conflict, we backtrack to the previous vertex and try a different color.\n\n4. **Output the Solution**: Once all vertices are colored without conflicts, we output the solution.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find a valid coloring for the graph.\n\n```python\ndef is_valid_color(vertex, color, graph, colors):\n    for neighbor in graph[vertex]:\n        if colors[neighbor] == color:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef graph_coloring(graph, num_colors, colors, vertex):\n    if vertex == len(graph):\n        return True\n    \n    for color in range(1, num_colors + 1):\n        if is_valid_color(vertex, color, graph, colors):\n            colors[vertex] = color\n            if graph_coloring(graph, num_colors, colors, vertex + 1):\n                return True\n            colors[vertex] = 0\n    \n    return False\n\ndef solve_graph_coloring():\n    vertices = 10\n    edges = [(0, 4), (1, 7), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (6, 8)]\n    num_colors = 3\n    \n    # Create adjacency list for the graph\n    graph = {i: [] for i in range(vertices)}\n    for (u, v) in edges:\n        graph[u].append(v)\n        graph[v].append(u)\n    \n    # Initialize colors for each vertex\n    colors = [0] * vertices\n    \n    if graph_coloring(graph, num_colors, colors, 0):\n        return {str(i): colors[i] for i in range(vertices)}\n    else:\n        return \"No solution\"\n\n# Execute the function and print the result\nresult = solve_graph_coloring()\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to color the graph using the given constraints and return a valid coloring if possible. Let's execute it to see the result.",
