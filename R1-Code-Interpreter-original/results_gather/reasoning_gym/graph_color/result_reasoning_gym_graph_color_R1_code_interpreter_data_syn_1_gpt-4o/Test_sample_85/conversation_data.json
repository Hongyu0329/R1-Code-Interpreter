    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. The graph has 10 vertices and 5 edges, and we have 3 possible colors to use.\n\nThe approach to solve this problem is as follows:\n1. Start with the first vertex and assign it the first color.\n2. Move to the next vertex and assign it the lowest possible color that hasn't been used by its adjacent vertices.\n3. Continue this process for all vertices.\n4. If a vertex cannot be colored with any of the available colors, backtrack and try a different color for the previous vertex.\n\nLet's implement this logic using a Python script to find a valid coloring for the graph.\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(vertex, color, graph, colors):\n    for neighbor in graph[vertex]:\n        if colors[neighbor] == color:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef graph_coloring(graph, m, colors, vertex):\n    if vertex == len(graph):\n        return True\n\n    for color in range(1, m + 1):\n        if is_safe(vertex, color, graph, colors):\n            colors[vertex] = color\n            if graph_coloring(graph, m, colors, vertex + 1):\n                return True\n            colors[vertex] = 0\n\n    return False\n\ndef solve_graph_coloring():\n    vertices = 10\n    edges = [(1, 5), (3, 8), (4, 5), (7, 8), (8, 9)]\n    graph = {i: [] for i in range(vertices)}\n    for u, v in edges:\n        graph[u].append(v)\n        graph[v].append(u)\n\n    colors = [0] * vertices\n    m = 3  # Number of colors\n\n    if graph_coloring(graph, m, colors, 0):\n        return {str(i): colors[i] for i in range(vertices)}\n    else:\n        return \"No solution\"\n\nresult = solve_graph_coloring()\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code defines a function to check if a color can be safely assigned to a vertex, a recursive function to attempt to color the graph, and a main function to set up the graph and find a solution. The result is printed as a JSON map of vertices to colors.",
