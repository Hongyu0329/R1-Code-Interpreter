    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have 10 vertices and 8 edges, and we can use up to 3 colors.\n\nThe graph coloring problem is a classic problem that can be solved using a greedy algorithm. The greedy algorithm works by assigning the smallest possible color to each vertex, ensuring that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nLet's outline the steps for the greedy algorithm:\n1. Initialize a color assignment for each vertex as uncolored (or 0).\n2. For each vertex, check the colors of its adjacent vertices.\n3. Assign the smallest available color that is not used by its adjacent vertices.\n4. Continue this process for all vertices.\n\nNow, let's implement this algorithm in Python to find a valid coloring for the graph.\n\n```python\n# Define the graph properties\nvertices = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\nedges = [(0, 1), (0, 6), (2, 6), (2, 8), (3, 4), (3, 6), (5, 6), (5, 7)]\ncolors = [1, 2, 3]\n\n# Initialize the color assignment for each vertex\ncolor_assignment = {vertex: 0 for vertex in vertices}\n\n# Function to find the smallest available color for a vertex\ndef find_smallest_color(vertex, edges, color_assignment, colors):\n    # Find the colors of adjacent vertices\n    adjacent_colors = set()\n    for edge in edges:\n        if edge[0] == vertex:\n            adjacent_colors.add(color_assignment[edge[1]])\n        elif edge[1] == vertex:\n            adjacent_colors.add(color_assignment[edge[0]])\n    \n    # Find the smallest color not used by adjacent vertices\n    for color in colors:\n        if color not in adjacent_colors:\n            return color\n    return None\n\n# Assign colors to each vertex\nfor vertex in vertices:\n    color_assignment[vertex] = find_smallest_color(vertex, edges, color_assignment, colors)\n\n# Print the color assignment\nprint(color_assignment)\n```\n\nThis code will output a valid coloring for the graph. Let's execute it to see the result.",
