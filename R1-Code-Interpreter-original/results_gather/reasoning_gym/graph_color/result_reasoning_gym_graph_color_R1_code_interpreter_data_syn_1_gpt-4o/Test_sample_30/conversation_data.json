    "To solve the graph coloring problem, we need to assign colors to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. We have three colors available: 1, 2, and 3. The graph has 10 vertices and 7 edges.\n\nThe approach to solve this problem is to use a greedy coloring algorithm. This algorithm works by assigning the smallest possible color to each vertex, ensuring that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nLet's implement this algorithm in Python to find a valid coloring for the graph.\n\n```python\ndef graph_coloring(vertices, edges, colors):\n    # Initialize the color assignment for each vertex\n    color_assignment = {vertex: None for vertex in vertices}\n    \n    # Assign colors to each vertex\n    for vertex in vertices:\n        # Find the colors of the adjacent vertices\n        adjacent_colors = set()\n        for edge in edges:\n            if edge[0] == vertex and color_assignment[edge[1]] is not None:\n                adjacent_colors.add(color_assignment[edge[1]])\n            elif edge[1] == vertex and color_assignment[edge[0]] is not None:\n                adjacent_colors.add(color_assignment[edge[0]])\n        \n        # Assign the smallest possible color that is not used by adjacent vertices\n        for color in colors:\n            if color not in adjacent_colors:\n                color_assignment[vertex] = color\n                break\n    \n    return color_assignment\n\n# Define the graph properties\nvertices = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\nedges = [(0, 1), (0, 8), (1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 7), (3, 7), (4, 9)]\ncolors = [1, 2, 3]\n\n# Get the color assignment\ncolor_assignment = graph_coloring(vertices, edges, colors)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(color_assignment)\n```\n\nThis code will assign colors to the vertices of the graph using a greedy algorithm. Let's execute it to find the solution.",

The output is a JSON map of vertices to colors, ensuring that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. \n\nThe result is:\n- Vertex 0 is colored with 1\n- Vertex 1 is colored with 2\n- Vertex 2 is colored with 1\n- Vertex 3 is colored with 1\n- Vertex 4 is colored with 1\n- Vertex 5 is colored with 1\n- Vertex 6 is colored with 1\n- Vertex 7 is colored with 2\n- Vertex 8 is colored with 2\n- Vertex 9 is colored with 2\n\nThis coloring satisfies the condition that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\n<<<{0: 1, 1: 2, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 1, 6: 1, 7: 2, 8: 2, 9: 2}>>>"
