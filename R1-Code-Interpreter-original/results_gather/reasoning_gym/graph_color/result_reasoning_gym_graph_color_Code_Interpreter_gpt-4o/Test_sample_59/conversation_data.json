    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign colors to the vertices of the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. Given the edges \\((1, 8)\\) and \\((7, 8)\\), vertices 1 and 8 are connected, as well as vertices 7 and 8. We can use the three available colors to ensure that adjacent vertices have different colors.\n\nLet's proceed with the coloring:\n\n1. Assign color 1 to vertex 8.\n2. Assign color 2 to vertex 1 (since it is adjacent to vertex 8).\n3. Assign color 3 to vertex 7 (since it is adjacent to vertex 8).\n\nThe remaining vertices (0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9) are not connected to any other vertices, so they can be assigned any of the available colors. For simplicity, we can assign color 1 to all of them.\n\nHere's the JSON map of vertices to colors:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 2, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 3, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 1}>>>"
