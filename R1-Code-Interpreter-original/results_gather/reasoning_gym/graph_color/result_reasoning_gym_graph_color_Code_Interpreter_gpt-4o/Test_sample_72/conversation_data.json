Given the graph's properties, we can use a greedy coloring algorithm to find a valid coloring.\n\nLet's proceed with the coloring: \n\n1. Start with vertex 0 and assign it the first color.\n2. Move to vertex 7, which is connected to vertex 0, and assign it a different color.\n3. Move to vertex 5, which is connected to vertex 7, and assign it a different color from vertex 7.\n4.
