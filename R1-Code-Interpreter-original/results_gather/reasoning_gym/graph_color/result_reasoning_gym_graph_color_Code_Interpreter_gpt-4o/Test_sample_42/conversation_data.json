    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign colors to the vertices of the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. This is a classic graph coloring problem. Given the constraints, we will attempt to color the graph using the three available colors.\n\nLet's proceed with the coloring: \n\n1. Start with vertex 0 and assign it the first color.\n2. Move to the next vertex and assign it a color that is different from its adjacent vertices.\n3.
