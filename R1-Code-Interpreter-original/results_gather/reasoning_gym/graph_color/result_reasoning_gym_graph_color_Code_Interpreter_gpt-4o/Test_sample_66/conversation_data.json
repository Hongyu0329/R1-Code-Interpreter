Given the edges \\((0, 2)\\) and \\((1, 6)\\), we can use the three available colors to ensure this condition is met.\n\nLet's proceed with the coloring:\n\n1. Assign color 1 to vertex 0.\n2. Assign color 2 to vertex 2 (since it is connected to vertex 0).\n3. Assign color 1 to vertex 1.\n4. Assign color 2 to vertex 6 (since it is connected to vertex 1).\n5. Assign color 1 to the remaining vertices (3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9) as they are not directly connected to any other vertex.\n\nNow, let's represent this coloring as a JSON map.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the vertices and their assigned colors\ncoloring = {\n    \"0\": 1,\n    \"1\": 1,\n    \"2\": 2,\n    \"3\": 1,\n    \"4\": 1,\n    \"5\": 1,\n    \"6\": 2,\n    \"7\": 1,\n    \"8\": 1,\n    \"9\": 1\n}\n\ncoloring\nassistant > Here is a valid coloring for the graph:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 2, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 1}>>>\n\nThis coloring ensures that no two adjacent vertices share the same color."
