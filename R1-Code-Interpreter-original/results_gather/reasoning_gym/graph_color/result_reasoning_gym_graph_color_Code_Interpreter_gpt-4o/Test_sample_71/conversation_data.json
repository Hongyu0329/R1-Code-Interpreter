    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign colors to the vertices of the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. This is known as a graph coloring problem. Given the edges and the available colors, we can attempt to color the graph.\n\nLet's proceed with the coloring: \n\n1. Start with vertex 0 and assign it the first color.\n2. Move to the next vertex and assign it a color that is not used by its adjacent vertices.\n3.
