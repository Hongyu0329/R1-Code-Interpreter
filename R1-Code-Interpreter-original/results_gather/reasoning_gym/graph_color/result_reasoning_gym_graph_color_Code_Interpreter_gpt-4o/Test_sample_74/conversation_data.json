    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to color the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. This is known as a graph coloring problem. Given the constraints, we will attempt to color the graph using the three available colors.\n\nLet's proceed with the coloring: \n\n1. Start with vertex 0 and assign it the first color.\n2. Move to vertex 1, which is adjacent to vertex 0, and assign it a different color.\n3. Continue this process for each vertex, ensuring that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nLet's implement this approach.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the graph properties\nvertices = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\nedges = [(0, 1), (0, 4), (2, 4), (2, 9)]\ncolors = [1, 2, 3]\n\n# Initialize the coloring map\ncoloring = {}\n\n# Function to find a valid color for a vertex\ndef find_color(vertex, edges, coloring, colors):\n    # Find the colors of adjacent vertices\n    adjacent_colors = {coloring[adj] for adj in vertices if (vertex, adj) in edges or (adj, vertex) in edges if adj in coloring}\n    # Choose the first available color that is not used by adjacent vertices\n    for color in colors:\n        if color not in adjacent_colors:\n            return color\n    return None\n\n# Color the graph\nfor vertex in vertices:\n    coloring[vertex] = find_color(vertex, edges, coloring, colors)\n\ncoloring\nassistant > The graph has been successfully colored such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.
