    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign colors to the vertices of the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. Given the edges \\((0, 5)\\) and \\((1, 7)\\), we can assign colors to the vertices while ensuring that adjacent vertices have different colors.\n\nLet's proceed with the coloring:\n\n1. Assign color 1 to vertex 0.\n2. Assign color 2 to vertex 5 (since it is adjacent to vertex 0).\n3. Assign color 1 to vertex 1.\n4. Assign color 2 to vertex 7 (since it is adjacent to vertex 1).\n\nFor the remaining vertices (2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9), since they are not connected to any other vertices, we can assign any color to them. Let's assign color 1 to all of them for simplicity.\n\nHere's the JSON map of vertices to colors:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 2, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 2, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 1}>>>"
