    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign colors to the vertices of the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. This is a classic graph coloring problem. Given the constraints, we will attempt to color the graph using the three available colors: 1, 2, and 3.\n\nLet's proceed with the coloring: \n\n1. Start with vertex 0 and assign it color 1.\n2. Vertex 5 is adjacent to vertex 0, so it cannot be color 1. Assign it color 2.\n3. Vertex 1 is not adjacent to any colored vertex yet, so assign it color 1.\n4. Vertex 9 is adjacent to vertex 1, so it cannot be color 1. Assign it color 2.\n5. Vertex 2 is not adjacent to any colored vertex yet, so assign it color 1.\n6. Vertex 3 is not adjacent to any colored vertex yet, so assign it color 1.\n7. Vertex 4 is not adjacent to any colored vertex yet, so assign it color 1.\n8. Vertices 6, 7, and 8 are not adjacent to any colored vertices, so assign them color 1.\n\nNow, let's verify and finalize the coloring.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the graph structure\nvertices = list(range(10))\nedges = [(0, 5), (1, 9), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5)]\n\n# Initialize the coloring map\ncoloring = {v: None for v in vertices}\n\n# Available colors\ncolors = [1, 2, 3]\n\n# Function to find a valid color for a vertex\ndef find_color(vertex, coloring, edges):\n    # Find colors of adjacent vertices\n    adjacent_colors = {coloring[v] for u, v in edges if u == vertex and coloring[v] is not None}\n    adjacent_colors.update({coloring[u] for u, v in edges if v == vertex and coloring[u] is not None})\n    \n    # Choose the first available color that is not used by adjacent vertices\n    for color in colors:\n        if color not in adjacent_colors:\n            return color\n    return None\n\n# Assign colors to each vertex\nfor vertex in vertices:\n    coloring[vertex] = find_color(vertex, coloring, edges)\n\ncoloring\nassistant > The graph has been successfully colored such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.
