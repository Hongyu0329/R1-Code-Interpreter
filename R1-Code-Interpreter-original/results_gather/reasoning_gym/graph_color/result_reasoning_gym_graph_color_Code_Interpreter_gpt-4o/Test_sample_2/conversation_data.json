    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign colors to the vertices of the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. Given the graph's properties, we can use a greedy coloring algorithm to find a valid coloring.\n\nLet's proceed with the coloring: \n\n1. Start with vertex 0 and assign it the first color.\n2. Move to the next vertex and assign it the lowest possible color that hasn't been used by its adjacent vertices.\n\nWe'll continue this process for all vertices.
