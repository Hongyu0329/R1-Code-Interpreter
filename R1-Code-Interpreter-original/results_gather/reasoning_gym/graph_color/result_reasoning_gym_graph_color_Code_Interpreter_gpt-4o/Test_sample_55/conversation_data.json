Given the graph's properties, we can use a greedy algorithm to assign colors to the vertices.\n\nLet's proceed with the coloring: \n\n1. Start with the first vertex and assign it the first color.\n2. Move to the next vertex and assign it the lowest-numbered color that hasn't been used by its adjacent vertices.\n3.
