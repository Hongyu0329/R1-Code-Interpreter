    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to color the graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. This is known as a graph coloring problem. Given the graph's properties, we can use a greedy algorithm to assign colors to the vertices.\n\nLet's proceed with the coloring: \n\n1. Start with vertex 0 and assign it the first color.\n2.
