    "Let me solve this graph coloring problem step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we have:\n   - 10 vertices (0 through 9)\n   - Only 2 edges: (5,6) and (7,9)\n   - 3 possible colors (1, 2, 3)\n\n2) This is a very sparse graph! Most vertices are not connected to any other vertex.\n   - Only vertices 5-6 and 7-9 need different colors\n   - All other vertices can have any color\n\n3) Let's write a Python program to:\n   - Create a graph representation\n   - Implement a simple coloring algorithm\n   - Verify the solution\n   - Return the result in JSON format\n\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Create graph representation\nvertices = list(range(10))\nedges = [(5, 6), (7, 9)]\ncolors = [1, 2, 3]\n\n# Initialize coloring\ncoloring = {}\n\n# Create adjacency list for easier processing\nadj_list = {v: [] for v in vertices}\nfor v1, v2 in edges:\n    adj_list[v1].append(v2)\n    adj_list[v2].append(v1)\n\n# Color vertices\nfor v in vertices:\n    # For vertices with no neighbors, just use color 1\n    if not adj_list[v]:\n        coloring[v] = 1\n        continue\n    \n    # For vertices with neighbors, find first available color\n    neighbor_colors = {coloring[n] for n in adj_list[v] if n in coloring}\n    for color in colors:\n        if color not in neighbor_colors:\n            coloring[v] = color\n            break\n\n# Convert to string format\nresult = {str(k): v for k, v in coloring.items()}\nprint(\"<<<\" + json.dumps(result) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nLet's analyze what this code does:\n1) Creates an adjacency list representation of the graph\n2) For each vertex:\n   - If it has no neighbors, assigns color 1\n   - If it has neighbors, finds the first available color not used by neighbors\n3) Converts the result to the required format\n\nThe solution is valid because:\n- All vertices get a color (1, 2, or 3)\n- Vertices 5 and 6 get different colors\n- Vertices 7 and 9 get different colors\n- All other vertices can have any color (we give them color 1 for simplicity)\n\nThe code will output a valid coloring in the required format. Let's use the output directly as our answer:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 2}>>>",
    "Since the code executed successfully without errors and provided a valid solution, I can confirm this is our final answer. Let's verify the solution one last time:\n\n1) All vertices (0-9) are assigned a color (1 or 2 in this case)\n2) For edge (5,6):\n   - Vertex 5 has color 1\n   - Vertex 6 has color 2\n   - Different colors ✓\n3) For edge (7,9):\n   - Vertex 7 has color 1\n   - Vertex 9 has color 2\n   - Different colors ✓\n4) All other vertices have color 1, which is fine since they're not connected to any other vertex\n\nThe solution is valid and meets all requirements. Therefore, I'll return the same answer:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 2}>>>"
