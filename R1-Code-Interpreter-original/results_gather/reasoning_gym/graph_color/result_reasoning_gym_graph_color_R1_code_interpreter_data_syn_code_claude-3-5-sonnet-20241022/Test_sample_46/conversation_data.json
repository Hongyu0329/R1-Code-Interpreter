    "Let me help solve this graph coloring problem through a systematic approach.\n\nThinking process:\n1. This is a graph coloring problem where we need to assign colors to vertices such that no adjacent vertices have the same color.\n2. We can use a backtracking algorithm to try different color combinations.\n3. We'll first build the adjacency list representation of the graph.\n4. Then implement a function to check if a color assignment is valid.\n5. Finally, use backtracking to find a valid coloring.\n\nLet's write code to solve this:\n\n```python\ndef is_safe(graph, vertex, color, coloring):\n    # Check if any adjacent vertex has the same color\n    for neighbor in graph[vertex]:\n        if neighbor in coloring and coloring[neighbor] == color:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef graph_coloring(graph, colors, vertices):\n    # Initialize empty coloring dictionary\n    coloring = {}\n    \n    # Create adjacency list representation\n    adj_list = {v: [] for v in vertices}\n    for edge in [(0, 1), (0, 6), (5, 9), (6, 8), (8, 9)]:\n        adj_list[edge[0]].append(edge[1])\n        adj_list[edge[1]].append(edge[0])\n    \n    def backtrack(vertex_idx):\n        if vertex_idx == len(vertices):\n            return True\n        \n        current_vertex = vertices[vertex_idx]\n        \n        # Try each color\n        for color in colors:\n            if is_safe(adj_list, current_vertex, color, coloring):\n                coloring[current_vertex] = color\n                if backtrack(vertex_idx + 1):\n                    return True\n                coloring.pop(current_vertex, None)\n        \n        return False\n    \n    # Start backtracking from first vertex\n    backtrack(0)\n    \n    # Convert all values to strings for JSON compatibility\n    result = {str(k): v for k, v in coloring.items()}\n    \n    print(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n\n# Input data\nvertices = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\ncolors = [1, 2, 3]\n\ngraph_coloring({}, colors, vertices)\n```\n\nThe code works as follows:\n1. We create an adjacency list representation of the graph.\n2. The is_safe function checks if it's valid to assign a color to a vertex.\n3. We use backtracking to try different color combinations.\n4. The solution is guaranteed to exist since we have 3 colors and the graph is sparse.\n5. The result is formatted as requested with triple angle brackets.\n\nThe code will output a valid coloring. Since there are multiple possible solutions, any valid solution where no adjacent vertices have the same color is acceptable.\n\nThe output from the code execution will be our final answer, as it will be in the correct format: <<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 2, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 2}>>>",
    "Let me verify if this solution is correct by checking the constraints:\n\n1. All vertices [0-9] have been assigned a color (✓)\n2. Only colors from [1, 2, 3] are used (✓)\n3. Let's check each edge to ensure connected vertices have different colors:\n   - (0, 1): 1 ≠ 2 (✓)\n   - (0, 6): 1 ≠ 2 (✓)\n   - (5, 9): 1 ≠ 2 (✓)\n   - (6, 8): 2 ≠ 1 (✓)\n   - (8, 9): 1 ≠ 2 (✓)\n\nThe solution is valid because:\n1. Every vertex has been assigned a color\n2. All colors used (1 and 2) are from the allowed set [1, 2, 3]\n3. No adjacent vertices share the same color\n4. The format matches the required JSON map enclosed in triple angle brackets\n\nTherefore, I can confirm this is a correct solution:\n\n<<<{'0': 1, '1': 2, '2': 1, '3': 1, '4': 1, '5': 1, '6': 2, '7': 1, '8': 1, '9': 2}>>>"
