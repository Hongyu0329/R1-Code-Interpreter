    "Let me solve this graph coloring problem step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need:\n   - We have 10 vertices (0-9)\n   - We have 3 edges: (4,5), (4,8), (5,7)\n   - We can use 3 colors: [1,2,3]\n   - Each connected vertex must have different colors\n\n2) This is a graph coloring problem, but it's relatively simple because:\n   - Most vertices are disconnected\n   - We only have 3 edges\n   - We have enough colors (3) to color any simple graph structure\n\n3) Let's write code to:\n   - Create the graph structure\n   - Implement a simple coloring algorithm\n   - Verify the solution\n   - Return the result in JSON format\n\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef solve_graph_coloring():\n    # Initialize vertices and edges\n    vertices = list(range(10))\n    edges = [(4, 5), (4, 8), (5, 7)]\n    colors = [1, 2, 3]\n    \n    # Create adjacency list\n    adj_list = {v: [] for v in vertices}\n    for v1, v2 in edges:\n        adj_list[v1].append(v2)\n        adj_list[v2].append(v1)\n    \n    # Initialize coloring\n    coloring = {}\n    \n    # For vertices with edges, ensure proper coloring\n    for vertex in vertices:\n        if adj_list[vertex]:  # If vertex has connections\n            # Get colors of neighbors\n            neighbor_colors = {coloring.get(n) for n in adj_list[vertex]}\n            # Choose first available color\n            for color in colors:\n                if color not in neighbor_colors:\n                    coloring[vertex] = color\n                    break\n        else:  # If vertex has no connections\n            coloring[vertex] = 1  # Use first color for isolated vertices\n    \n    # Fill in any uncolored vertices\n    for vertex in vertices:\n        if vertex not in coloring:\n            coloring[vertex] = 1\n    \n    # Convert to string format\n    result = {str(k): v for k, v in coloring.items()}\n    return json.dumps(result)\n\nprint(solve_graph_coloring())\n```\n\nLet's analyze what this code does:\n1) Creates an adjacency list representation of the graph\n2) For vertices with edges:\n   - Checks neighbors' colors\n   - Assigns first available color that's different from neighbors\n3) For isolated vertices:\n   - Assigns color 1 (since they have no constraints)\n4) Returns the result in JSON format\n\nThe solution is valid because:\n- Vertex 4 is connected to 5 and 8, so they must have different colors\n- Vertex 5 is connected to 4 and 7, so they must have different colors\n- All other vertices are isolated and can have any color\n\nThe code has provided a valid coloring. Let's use this as our answer:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 2, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 2, \"9\": 1}>>>",
    "The code executed successfully and provided a valid solution. Let's verify the solution:\n\n1) Checking the constraints:\n   - Edge (4,5): vertex 4 has color 1, vertex 5 has color 2 ✓\n   - Edge (4,8): vertex 4 has color 1, vertex 8 has color 2 ✓\n   - Edge (5,7): vertex 5 has color 2, vertex 7 has color 1 ✓\n\n2) All vertices are colored with valid colors (1 or 2) from the allowed set [1,2,3]\n\n3) No adjacent vertices share the same color\n\n4) The solution is minimal in the sense that it uses only two colors (1 and 2) even though we had three colors available\n\nThe solution is correct and satisfies all the requirements. I will return the solution as provided by the code:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 2, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 2, \"9\": 1}>>>"
