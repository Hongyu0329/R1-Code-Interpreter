    "Let me solve this graph coloring problem step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need:\n   - We have 10 vertices (0 through 9)\n   - We have 4 edges connecting some vertices\n   - We need to assign one of three colors (1, 2, or 3) to each vertex\n   - Connected vertices must have different colors\n\n2) This is a graph coloring problem, and since we have only a few edges, it's relatively simple:\n   - Vertices 0 and 6 must have different colors\n   - Vertices 2 and 9 must have different colors\n   - Vertices 4 and 9 must have different colors\n   - Vertices 5 and 6 must have different colors\n\n3) Let's write a program to find a valid coloring:\n   - We'll create an adjacency list representation\n   - Use a simple algorithm to assign colors\n   - Verify the solution is valid\n\n```python\ndef is_valid_coloring(graph, colors):\n    # Check if adjacent vertices have different colors\n    for v1, v2 in graph:\n        if v1 in colors and v2 in colors and colors[v1] == colors[v2]:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef find_coloring():\n    vertices = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n    edges = [(0, 6), (2, 9), (4, 9), (5, 6)]\n    possible_colors = [1, 2, 3]\n    \n    # Initialize all vertices with color 1\n    coloring = {v: 1 for v in vertices}\n    \n    # Create adjacency list\n    adj_list = {}\n    for v in vertices:\n        adj_list[v] = []\n    for v1, v2 in edges:\n        adj_list[v1].append(v2)\n        adj_list[v2].append(v1)\n    \n    # For each vertex with edges, ensure valid coloring\n    for v in vertices:\n        if adj_list[v]:\n            # Get colors of neighbors\n            neighbor_colors = {coloring[n] for n in adj_list[v]}\n            # Find first available color\n            for color in possible_colors:\n                if color not in neighbor_colors:\n                    coloring[v] = color\n                    break\n    \n    # Convert to JSON string format\n    result = str(coloring).replace(\"'\", '\"')\n    print(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n\nfind_coloring()\n```\n\nThe code:\n1) Creates an adjacency list representation of the graph\n2) Initializes all vertices with color 1\n3) For each vertex that has edges, checks its neighbors' colors and assigns the first available color that's different from its neighbors\n4) Formats the result as requested\n\nThe solution is valid because:\n- Vertices 0 and 6 will have different colors\n- Vertices 2 and 9 will have different colors\n- Vertices 4 and 9 will have different colors\n- Vertices 5 and 6 will have different colors\n- All other vertices can keep their initial color as they have no constraints\n\nThe code will generate a valid coloring that satisfies all the constraints. The output will be in the requested format with triple angle brackets containing a JSON map of vertices to colors.\n\nThe solution provided by the code execution will be our final answer, as it will give us a valid coloring that satisfies all the requirements.",
    "Let me verify if this solution is correct by checking the constraints:\n\n1) Edge (0, 6): vertex 0 has color 2, vertex 6 has color 1 ✓\n2) Edge (2, 9): vertex 2 has color 2, vertex 9 has color 1 ✓\n3) Edge (4, 9): vertex 4 has color 2, vertex 9 has color 1 ✓\n4) Edge (5, 6): vertex 5 has color 2, vertex 6 has color 1 ✓\n\nThe solution is valid because:\n- All vertices have been assigned a color from the allowed set [1, 2, 3]\n- No adjacent vertices share the same color\n- Every constraint from the edges is satisfied\n\nTherefore, I can confirm this is a valid solution and provide it as the final answer:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 2, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 2, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 2, \"5\": 2, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 1}>>>"
