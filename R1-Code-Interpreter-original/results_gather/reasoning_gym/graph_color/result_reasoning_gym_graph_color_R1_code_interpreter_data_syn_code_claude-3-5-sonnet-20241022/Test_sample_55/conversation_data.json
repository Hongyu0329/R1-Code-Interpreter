    "Let me solve this graph coloring problem step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need:\n   - We have 10 vertices (0-9)\n   - We have 4 edges connecting some vertices\n   - We need to assign colors (1, 2, or 3) to each vertex\n   - Connected vertices must have different colors\n\n2) This is a graph coloring problem, but it's relatively simple because:\n   - The graph is very sparse (few edges)\n   - We have 3 colors available\n   - Many vertices are isolated (not connected to any other vertex)\n\n3) Let's write a program that will:\n   - Create the graph representation\n   - Implement a function to check if a coloring is valid\n   - Find a valid coloring\n   - Format the output as required\n\n```python\ndef is_valid_coloring(graph, colors, vertex, color):\n    # Check if any adjacent vertex has the same color\n    for neighbor in graph[vertex]:\n        if neighbor in colors and colors[neighbor] == color:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef color_graph():\n    # Initialize graph as adjacency list\n    vertices = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n    edges = [(1, 3), (1, 5), (5, 8), (7, 8)]\n    possible_colors = [1, 2, 3]\n    \n    # Create adjacency list representation\n    graph = {v: [] for v in vertices}\n    for v1, v2 in edges:\n        graph[v1].append(v2)\n        graph[v2].append(v1)\n    \n    # Initialize colors dictionary\n    colors = {}\n    \n    # For each vertex\n    for vertex in vertices:\n        # Try each color\n        for color in possible_colors:\n            if is_valid_coloring(graph, colors, vertex, color):\n                colors[vertex] = color\n                break\n    \n    # Convert to required format\n    result = {str(k): v for k, v in colors.items()}\n    print(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n\n# Run the solution\ncolor_graph()\n```\n\nLet's analyze what this code does:\n1) Creates an adjacency list representation of the graph\n2) For each vertex, tries colors 1, 2, 3 in order until finding a valid one\n3) A color is valid if no adjacent vertex has the same color\n4) Since we have 3 colors and the maximum degree of any vertex is 2 (vertex 8 has two neighbors), we're guaranteed to find a solution\n\nThe code will output a valid coloring. Since many vertices are isolated (0, 2, 4, 6, 9), they can take any color (the code will give them color 1). The connected components (1-3-5-8-7) will get different colors where needed.\n\nThe output from the code execution will be our final answer, as it will be in the correct format with triple angle brackets and represent a valid coloring where no adjacent vertices have the same color.\n\nThe solution provided by the code is optimal because:\n1) It uses the minimum number of colors needed\n2) It handles isolated vertices efficiently\n3) It ensures no adjacent vertices have the same color\n4) It provides the output in the exact format requested\n\nThe code execution will provide our final answer in the required format.",
    "The code has executed successfully and provided a valid coloring solution. Let me verify the solution:\n\n1) Let's check if the coloring is valid by examining each edge:\n   - Edge (1, 3): Vertex 1 has color 1, Vertex 3 has color 2 ✓\n   - Edge (1, 5): Vertex 1 has color 1, Vertex 5 has color 2 ✓\n   - Edge (5, 8): Vertex 5 has color 2, Vertex 8 has color 3 ✓\n   - Edge (7, 8): Vertex 7 has color 1, Vertex 8 has color 3 ✓\n\n2) All isolated vertices (0, 2, 4, 6, 9) were assigned color 1, which is perfectly fine as they don't have any constraints.\n\n3) The solution satisfies all requirements:\n   - Every vertex has been assigned a color\n   - No adjacent vertices have the same color\n   - Only colors from the allowed set [1, 2, 3] were used\n   - The format matches the requirement\n\nSince all conditions are met and the output is in the correct format, I can confirm this is a valid solution.\n\n<<<{'0': 1, '1': 1, '2': 1, '3': 2, '4': 1, '5': 2, '6': 1, '7': 1, '8': 3, '9': 1}>>>"
