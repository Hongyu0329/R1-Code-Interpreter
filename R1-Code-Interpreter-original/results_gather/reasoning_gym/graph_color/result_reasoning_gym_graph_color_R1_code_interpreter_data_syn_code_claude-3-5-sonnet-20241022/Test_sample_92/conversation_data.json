    "Let me solve this graph coloring problem step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we have:\n   - 10 vertices (0 through 9)\n   - Only 2 edges: (0,6) and (1,2)\n   - 3 possible colors (1, 2, 3)\n\n2) This is a very sparse graph! Most vertices are not connected to any other vertices.\n   - Vertex 0 is only connected to vertex 6\n   - Vertex 1 is only connected to vertex 2\n   - All other vertices are isolated\n\n3) For a valid coloring:\n   - Vertices 0 and 6 must have different colors\n   - Vertices 1 and 2 must have different colors\n   - All other vertices can have any color\n\nLet's write a Python script to find a valid coloring:\n\n```python\ndef find_graph_coloring():\n    # Initialize vertices and edges\n    vertices = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n    edges = [(0, 6), (1, 2)]\n    colors = [1, 2, 3]\n    \n    # Initialize coloring dictionary\n    coloring = {}\n    \n    # Create adjacency list for easier checking\n    adj_list = {v: [] for v in vertices}\n    for v1, v2 in edges:\n        adj_list[v1].append(v2)\n        adj_list[v2].append(v1)\n    \n    # Color each vertex\n    for vertex in vertices:\n        # Get colors of adjacent vertices\n        adjacent_colors = {coloring[adj] for adj in adj_list[vertex] if adj in coloring}\n        \n        # Choose first available color\n        for color in colors:\n            if color not in adjacent_colors:\n                coloring[vertex] = color\n                break\n    \n    # Convert to JSON-like string format\n    result = \"<<<{\"\n    result += \", \".join(f'\"{v}\": {coloring[v]}' for v in sorted(vertices))\n    result += \"}>>>\"\n    \n    print(result)\n\nfind_graph_coloring()\n```\n\nThe code:\n1) Creates an adjacency list representation of the graph\n2) For each vertex:\n   - Checks the colors of its adjacent vertices\n   - Assigns the first available color that's not used by any adjacent vertex\n3) Returns the result in the required format\n\nThe solution will be valid because:\n- For vertices 0 and 6: they will get different colors\n- For vertices 1 and 2: they will get different colors\n- All other vertices can get any color (we'll use color 1 for simplicity)\n\nThe output will be a valid coloring. Since there are multiple valid solutions, we're using a simple greedy approach that assigns the lowest possible color number to each vertex while maintaining the constraints.\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 2, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 1}>>>",
    "Since the code executed successfully without errors and provided a valid coloring, let me verify that the solution is correct:\n\n1) Let's check the constraints:\n   - Vertices 0 and 6 have different colors (1 and 2 respectively)\n   - Vertices 1 and 2 have different colors (1 and 2 respectively)\n   - All vertices have been assigned a valid color (either 1, 2, or 3)\n\n2) The solution satisfies all requirements because:\n   - Each vertex is assigned a color from the allowed set [1, 2, 3]\n   - No two adjacent vertices share the same color\n   - All vertices are colored\n   - The format matches the required JSON map format\n\nThe solution is optimal in the sense that it uses the minimum number of colors needed (2 colors) even though we had 3 colors available. This is because the graph is very sparse and can be colored with just 2 colors.\n\nSince we have a valid solution and it's in the correct format, I can confirm this is the final answer:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 2, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 1}>>>"
