    "Let me solve this graph coloring problem step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need:\n   - We have 10 vertices (0-9)\n   - We have specific edges connecting some vertices\n   - We need to assign colors (1, 2, or 3) to each vertex\n   - Connected vertices cannot have the same color\n\n2) This is a graph coloring problem, and since we have only a few edges, it's relatively simple:\n   - Most vertices are disconnected\n   - We only need to ensure connected vertices have different colors\n\n3) Let's write a Python script to:\n   - Create the graph representation\n   - Implement a function to check if a coloring is valid\n   - Find a valid coloring\n   - Format the output as required\n\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef is_valid_coloring(graph, colors, vertex, color):\n    # Check if any adjacent vertex has the same color\n    for neighbor in graph[vertex]:\n        if neighbor in colors and colors[neighbor] == color:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Create graph representation as adjacency list\nvertices = list(range(10))\nedges = [(0, 4), (2, 6), (4, 5), (5, 6)]\n\n# Convert to adjacency list\ngraph = {v: [] for v in vertices}\nfor v1, v2 in edges:\n    graph[v1].append(v2)\n    graph[v2].append(v1)\n\n# Initialize colors dictionary\ncolors = {}\n\n# For each vertex, assign the first valid color\nfor vertex in vertices:\n    for color in [1, 2, 3]:\n        if is_valid_coloring(graph, colors, vertex, color):\n            colors[vertex] = color\n            break\n\n# Convert to string format and print\nresult = {str(k): v for k, v in colors.items()}\nprint(f\"<<<{json.dumps(result)}>>>\")\n```\n\nLet's analyze what this code does:\n1) Creates an adjacency list representation of the graph\n2) For each vertex, tries to assign the smallest possible color (1, 2, or 3) that doesn't conflict with its neighbors\n3) Since the graph is sparse (few edges), most vertices can be colored with color 1\n4) Only vertices that are connected need different colors\n\nThe code will output a valid coloring where:\n- Vertices 0 and 4 will have different colors\n- Vertices 2 and 6 will have different colors\n- Vertices 4 and 5 will have different colors\n- Vertices 5 and 6 will have different colors\n\nThe output from the code execution will be our final answer, as it will be in the correct format with triple angle brackets and represent a valid coloring of the graph.\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 2, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 1}>>>",
    "Let me verify if this solution is correct by checking the constraints:\n\n1) Looking at the edges:\n   - (0,4): vertex 0 has color 1, vertex 4 has color 2 ✓\n   - (2,6): vertex 2 has color 1, vertex 6 has color 2 ✓\n   - (4,5): vertex 4 has color 2, vertex 5 has color 1 ✓\n   - (5,6): vertex 5 has color 1, vertex 6 has color 2 ✓\n\n2) All vertices have been assigned a color from the allowed set [1,2,3] ✓\n\n3) No adjacent vertices have the same color ✓\n\nThe solution is valid because:\n- All vertices are colored\n- All colors used (1 and 2) are from the allowed set [1,2,3]\n- No adjacent vertices share the same color\n- The format matches the required JSON map enclosed in triple angle brackets\n\nTherefore, I can confirm this is a correct solution.\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 2, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 1}>>>"
