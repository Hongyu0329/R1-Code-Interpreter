    "Let me solve this graph coloring problem step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need:\n   - We have 10 vertices (0-9)\n   - Only 3 edges: (0,4), (0,8), (3,6)\n   - We can use 3 colors: [1,2,3]\n   - Each connected vertex must have different colors\n\n2) This is a relatively simple graph coloring problem because:\n   - Most vertices are isolated (not connected to any other vertex)\n   - We only have 3 edges to consider\n   - We have 3 colors available\n\n3) Let's write a Python script to:\n   - Create the graph representation\n   - Implement a simple coloring algorithm\n   - Verify the solution\n   - Return the result in JSON format\n\n```python\nimport json\n\ndef color_graph():\n    # Initialize vertices and edges\n    vertices = list(range(10))\n    edges = [(0, 4), (0, 8), (3, 6)]\n    colors = [1, 2, 3]\n    \n    # Create adjacency list\n    adj_list = {v: [] for v in vertices}\n    for v1, v2 in edges:\n        adj_list[v1].append(v2)\n        adj_list[v2].append(v1)\n    \n    # Initialize coloring\n    coloring = {}\n    \n    # Color vertices\n    for vertex in vertices:\n        # Get colors of adjacent vertices\n        adjacent_colors = {coloring.get(adj) for adj in adj_list[vertex]}\n        # Choose first available color\n        for color in colors:\n            if color not in adjacent_colors:\n                coloring[vertex] = color\n                break\n    \n    # Convert to string format\n    result = {str(k): v for k, v in coloring.items()}\n    print(f\"<<<{json.dumps(result)}>>>\")\n\n# Run the coloring algorithm\ncolor_graph()\n```\n\nLet's analyze what this code does:\n1) Creates an adjacency list representation of the graph\n2) For each vertex:\n   - Checks colors of adjacent vertices\n   - Assigns the first available color that's not used by adjacent vertices\n3) Converts the result to the required JSON format\n\nThe solution is valid because:\n- Vertex 0 is connected to 4 and 8, so they must have different colors\n- Vertex 3 is connected to 6, so they must have different colors\n- All other vertices can have any color since they're not connected to anything\n\nThe code will generate a valid coloring where:\n- Connected vertices (0-4, 0-8, 3-6) have different colors\n- All vertices get assigned a color from [1,2,3]\n\nThe output from the code execution will be our final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 2, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 2, \"9\": 1}>>>",
    "The code executed successfully and provided a valid solution. Let's verify the solution:\n\n1) Checking the coloring constraints:\n   - Vertex 0 (color 1) is connected to:\n     * Vertex 4 (color 2) ✓\n     * Vertex 8 (color 2) ✓\n   - Vertex 3 (color 1) is connected to:\n     * Vertex 6 (color 2) ✓\n   - All other vertices are not connected to any other vertices, so their colors don't matter\n\n2) The solution satisfies all requirements:\n   - Every vertex has been assigned a color\n   - All colors used (1 and 2) are from the allowed set [1, 2, 3]\n   - No adjacent vertices share the same color\n   - The format is correct JSON with string keys\n\nSince the solution is valid and meets all requirements, we can use it as our final answer:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 2, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 2, \"9\": 1}>>>"
