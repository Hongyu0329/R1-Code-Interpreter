    "Let me solve this graph coloring problem step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need:\n   - We have 10 vertices (0-9)\n   - We have 3 edges: (1,6), (2,8), (4,6)\n   - We can use 3 colors: [1,2,3]\n   - We need to ensure connected vertices have different colors\n\n2) This is a relatively simple graph coloring problem because:\n   - Most vertices are isolated (not connected to any other vertex)\n   - We only have 3 edges to consider\n   - We have 3 colors available\n\n3) Let's write a Python script to:\n   - Create the graph representation\n   - Implement a simple coloring algorithm\n   - Verify the solution\n   - Format the output as required\n\n```python\ndef solve_graph_coloring():\n    # Initialize vertices and edges\n    vertices = list(range(10))\n    edges = [(1, 6), (2, 8), (4, 6)]\n    colors = [1, 2, 3]\n    \n    # Create adjacency list\n    adj_list = {v: [] for v in vertices}\n    for v1, v2 in edges:\n        adj_list[v1].append(v2)\n        adj_list[v2].append(v1)\n    \n    # Initialize coloring (all vertices can start with color 1)\n    coloring = {v: 1 for v in vertices}\n    \n    # For each vertex that's part of an edge, ensure proper coloring\n    for v1, v2 in edges:\n        # If adjacent vertices have same color, change one of them\n        if coloring[v1] == coloring[v2]:\n            # Try to find a different color for v2\n            for color in colors:\n                if color != coloring[v1]:\n                    coloring[v2] = color\n                    break\n    \n    # Convert to JSON string format\n    result = \"<<<\" + str(coloring).replace(\"'\", '\"') + \">>>\"\n    print(result)\n\nsolve_graph_coloring()\n```\n\nThe algorithm works as follows:\n1) Initialize all vertices with color 1 (since isolated vertices can share colors)\n2) For each edge, ensure the connected vertices have different colors\n3) Format the result as required\n\nThe solution is valid because:\n- All isolated vertices can keep color 1 (they don't affect each other)\n- For each edge, we ensure the connected vertices have different colors\n- We have enough colors (3) to handle the small number of edges (3)\n\nThe code will generate a valid coloring where:\n- Vertices 1 and 6 will have different colors\n- Vertices 2 and 8 will have different colors\n- Vertices 4 and 6 will have different colors\n- All other vertices can keep the default color\n\nThe output will be a valid coloring that satisfies all constraints.\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 2, \"9\": 1}>>>",
    "The code executed successfully and provided a valid solution. Let's verify the solution:\n\n1) Checking the coloring requirements:\n   - All vertices have been assigned a color (1 or 2)\n   - For edge (1,6): vertex 1 has color 1, vertex 6 has color 2 ✓\n   - For edge (2,8): vertex 2 has color 1, vertex 8 has color 2 ✓\n   - For edge (4,6): vertex 4 has color 1, vertex 6 has color 2 ✓\n   - All other vertices (0,3,5,7,9) are isolated and have color 1 ✓\n\n2) The solution is optimal because:\n   - We used only 2 colors (1 and 2) out of the available 3 colors\n   - The minimum number of colors needed for this graph is 2 since it's bipartite\n   - All isolated vertices can share the same color\n\n3) The output format is correct:\n   - It's a valid JSON map\n   - All vertices (0-9) are included\n   - The values are valid colors from the allowed set [1,2,3]\n\nSince the solution meets all requirements and constraints, I can confirm this is the final answer:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 1, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 2, \"7\": 1, \"8\": 2, \"9\": 1}>>>"
