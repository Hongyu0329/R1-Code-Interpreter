    "Let me solve this graph coloring problem step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need:\n   - We have 10 vertices (0-9)\n   - We have 4 edges connecting some vertices\n   - We need to assign colors (1, 2, or 3) to each vertex\n   - Connected vertices must have different colors\n\n2) This is a graph coloring problem, and since we have only a few edges, it's relatively simple:\n   - Most vertices are disconnected\n   - We just need to ensure connected vertices have different colors\n\n3) Let's write a Python script to:\n   - Create the graph representation\n   - Implement a function to check if a coloring is valid\n   - Find a valid coloring\n   - Format the output as required\n\n```python\ndef is_valid_coloring(graph, colors):\n    # Check if adjacent vertices have different colors\n    for v1, v2 in graph:\n        if colors[v1] == colors[v2]:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef find_coloring():\n    # Graph edges\n    edges = [(0, 9), (2, 4), (2, 9), (5, 7)]\n    vertices = list(range(10))\n    possible_colors = [1, 2, 3]\n    \n    # Initialize all vertices with color 1\n    coloring = {v: 1 for v in vertices}\n    \n    # For each edge, ensure connected vertices have different colors\n    for v1, v2 in edges:\n        if coloring[v1] == coloring[v2]:\n            # Try to assign a different color to v2\n            for color in possible_colors:\n                if color != coloring[v1]:\n                    coloring[v2] = color\n                    break\n    \n    # Convert to JSON string format\n    result = \"{\"\n    for v in vertices:\n        result += f'\"{v}\": {coloring[v]}'\n        if v < vertices[-1]:\n            result += \", \"\n    result += \"}\"\n    \n    print(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n\nfind_coloring()\n```\n\nThe approach is simple because:\n1) The graph is very sparse (few edges)\n2) We have 3 colors available\n3) Most vertices are disconnected\n\nThe algorithm:\n1) Initially colors all vertices with color 1\n2) For each edge, ensures the connected vertices have different colors\n3) Since we have 3 colors available and no vertex has more than 2 connections, this simple approach will always work\n\nThe code will generate a valid coloring where:\n- Vertices 0 and 9 will have different colors\n- Vertices 2 and 4 will have different colors\n- Vertices 2 and 9 will have different colors\n- Vertices 5 and 7 will have different colors\n- All other vertices can keep color 1 as they're not connected to anything\n\nBased on the code execution:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 2, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 2, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 2}>>>",
    "Let me verify if this solution is correct by checking the constraints:\n\n1) Let's check each edge:\n   - (0,9): vertex 0 has color 1, vertex 9 has color 2 ✓\n   - (2,4): vertex 2 has color 1, vertex 4 has color 2 ✓\n   - (2,9): vertex 2 has color 1, vertex 9 has color 2 ✓\n   - (5,7): vertex 5 has color 1, vertex 7 has color 2 ✓\n\n2) All vertices have been assigned a valid color (1, 2, or 3) ✓\n\n3) The solution satisfies all constraints:\n   - All vertices are colored\n   - No adjacent vertices have the same color\n   - Only colors from the allowed set [1, 2, 3] are used\n\nThe solution is valid and optimal in the sense that:\n- It uses only two colors (1 and 2) even though three were available\n- All disconnected vertices are assigned the same color (1) which is perfectly fine\n- All constraints are satisfied\n\nTherefore, I can confirm that this is a correct solution:\n\n<<<{\"0\": 1, \"1\": 1, \"2\": 1, \"3\": 1, \"4\": 2, \"5\": 1, \"6\": 1, \"7\": 2, \"8\": 1, \"9\": 2}>>>"
