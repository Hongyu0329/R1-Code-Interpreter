    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input Grid:**\n  - Notable elements: 8s at positions (1,6), (2,2), and (6,9).\n  - 2s form a block at positions (5,5), (5,6), (6,5), and (6,6).\n\n- **Output Grid:**\n  - The 8s have moved to positions (4,5), (4,7), and (6,8).\n  - The block of 2s remains unchanged.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input Grid:**\n  - Notable elements: 8s at positions (0,3), (1,9), and (4,1).\n  - 2s form a block at positions (3,6), (3,7), (4,6), and (4,7).\n\n- **Output Grid:**\n  - The 8s have moved to positions (2,5), (2,8), and (5,6).\n  - The block of 2s remains unchanged.\n\n### Observations:\n- The 8s in the input grid are moved to new positions in the output grid.\n- The 2s remain in the same positions in both input and output grids.\n- The movement of 8s seems to follow a pattern where they are shifted to a new position, often in a diagonal or adjacent manner.\n\n### Rule Deduction:\n- The 8s are moved to a new position, typically in a diagonal or adjacent manner, but the exact rule for their new position is not immediately clear from the examples.\n- The 2s remain unchanged.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input Grid:**\n  - Notable elements: 8s at positions (1,8), (2,3), and (7,0), (7,9).\n  - 2s form a block at positions (6,2), (6,3), (7,2), and (7,3).\n\n- **Predicted Output Grid:**\n  - The 8s will be moved to new positions. Based on the examples, we can predict:\n    - The 8 at (1,8) might move to (3,7).\n    - The 8 at (2,3) might move to (4,4).\n    - The 8 at (7,0) might move to (5,1).\n    - The 8 at (7,9) might move to (5,8).\n  - The block of 2s remains unchanged.\n\n### Final Predicted Output Grid:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0\n0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0\n0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n>>>"
