    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:**  \n  3 0 1 1 1  \n  5 5 9 5 8  \n  1 5 5 5 3  \n  1 1 8 6 9  \n  9 5 2 4 6  \n\n- **Output:**  \n  3 0 5 5 5  \n  1 1 9 1 8  \n  5 1 1 1 3  \n  5 5 8 6 9  \n  9 1 2 4 6  \n\n**Observations:**\n- The first row of the input becomes the first row of the output, but the third column onwards is replaced by the first row of the input.\n- The second row of the input becomes the second row of the output, but the first two elements are replaced by the first two elements of the first row of the input.\n- The third row of the input becomes the third row of the output, but the first element is replaced by the third element of the first row of the input.\n- The fourth and fifth rows remain unchanged.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:**  \n  9 5 6  \n  5 0 5  \n  1 1 3  \n\n- **Output:**  \n  9 1 6  \n  1 0 1  \n  5 5 3  \n\n**Observations:**\n- The first row of the input becomes the first row of the output, but the second element is replaced by the first element of the second row of the input.\n- The second row of the input becomes the second row of the output, but the first element is replaced by the first element of the third row of the input.\n- The third row remains unchanged.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:**  \n  6 5 2  \n  8 5 1  \n  3 8 4  \n\n- **Output:**  \n  6 1 2  \n  8 1 5  \n  3 8 4  \n\n**Observations:**\n- The first row of the input becomes the first row of the output, but the second element is replaced by the first element of the second row of the input.\n- The second row of the input becomes the second row of the output, but the third element is replaced by the first element of the third row of the input.\n- The third row remains unchanged.\n\n### Rule Deduction:\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- For each row in the output grid:\n  - The first row of the output grid is the same as the first row of the input grid, except the second element is replaced by the first element of the second row of the input grid.\n  - The second row of the output grid is the same as the second row of the input grid, except the first element is replaced by the first element of the third row of the input grid.\n  - The third row of the output grid is the same as the third row of the input grid, except the second element is replaced by the first element of the first row of the input grid.\n  - Any additional rows remain unchanged.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:**  \n  1 1 8 5  \n  6 1 0 5  \n  6 0 2 4  \n  9 8 1 1  \n\n- **Output Prediction:**\n  - First row: 1 6 8 5 (replace the second element with the first element of the second row)\n  - Second row: 6 1 0 5 (replace the first element with the first element of the third row)\n  - Third row: 6 1 2 4 (replace the second element with the first element of the first row)\n  - Fourth row: 9 8 1 1 (unchanged)\n\nThus, the predicted output grid is:\n\n<<<1 6 8 5  \n6 1 0 5  \n6 1 2 4  \n9 8 1 1>>>"
