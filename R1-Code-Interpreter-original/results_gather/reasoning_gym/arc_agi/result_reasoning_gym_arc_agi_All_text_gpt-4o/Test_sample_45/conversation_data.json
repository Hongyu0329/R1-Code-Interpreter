    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze each example step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input Grid:**\n  ```\n  0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n  0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n  0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n  0 0 8 6 6 0 0\n  0 0 8 6 6 0 0\n  0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n  ```\n- **Output Grid:**\n  ```\n  8 6 6\n  8 6 6\n  ```\n- **Observation:** The output grid is a subgrid of the input grid, specifically the non-zero part of the input grid.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input Grid:**\n  ```\n  0 0 0 0 0\n  0 0 0 0 0\n  0 0 0 0 0\n  0 2 5 0 0\n  0 0 2 2 0\n  0 0 2 2 0\n  0 0 0 0 0\n  ```\n- **Output Grid:**\n  ```\n  2 5 3\n  3 2 2\n  3 2 2\n  ```\n- **Observation:** The output grid is a subgrid of the input grid, capturing the non-zero elements. The zeros in the input grid are replaced by the number of non-zero elements in the row or column.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input Grid:**\n  ```\n  0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n  0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n  0 0 0 0 2 2 0\n  0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n  0 0 0 0 5 5 0\n  0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n  0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n  ```\n- **Output Grid:**\n  ```\n  2 2\n  3 3\n  5 5\n  ```\n- **Observation:** The output grid is a subgrid of the input grid, capturing the non-zero elements. The zeros in the input grid are replaced by the number of non-zero elements in the row or column.\n\n### Rule Deduction:\nThe rule seems to be:\n1. Identify the smallest rectangle that contains all the non-zero elements in the input grid.\n2. Extract this rectangle as the output grid.\n3. If there are zeros in the extracted rectangle, replace them with the count of non-zero elements in the respective row or column.\n\n### Test Input Analysis:\n- **Input Grid:**\n  ```\n  0 0 0 0 0 0\n  0 0 0 0 0 0\n  0 0 5 2 0 0\n  0 0 2 0 0 0\n  0 0 0 0 0 0\n  0 0 0 0 0 0\n  ```\n- **Steps:**\n  1. Identify the smallest rectangle containing all non-zero elements:\n     - The non-zero elements are in rows 2 and 3, columns 2 and 3.\n  2. Extract the subgrid:\n     ```\n     5 2\n     2 0\n     ```\n  3. Replace zeros with the count of non-zero elements in the row or column:\n     - The zero in the second row, second column should be replaced by 2 (since there are two non-zero elements in the column).\n\n- **Output Grid:**\n  ```\n  5 2\n  2 2\n  ```\n\nTherefore, the output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<5 2\n2 2>>>"
