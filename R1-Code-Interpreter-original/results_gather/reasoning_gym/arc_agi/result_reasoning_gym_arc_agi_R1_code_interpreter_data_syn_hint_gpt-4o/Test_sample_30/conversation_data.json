    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Observations from Examples:\n\n1. **Grid Size Reduction**: The output grid is smaller than the input grid. Specifically, the output grid is 7x7, while the input grids are larger.\n\n2. **Pattern Extraction**: The output grid seems to extract certain patterns or regions from the input grid. These regions are not contiguous blocks but seem to be specific rows and columns.\n\n3. **Row and Column Selection**: By examining the examples, it appears that the output grid is formed by selecting specific rows and columns from the input grid. The selected rows and columns are not always consecutive.\n\n4. **Example Analysis**:\n   - In Example 1, the output grid seems to be formed by selecting rows 5 to 11 and columns 5 to 11 from the input grid.\n   - In Example 2, the output grid seems to be formed by selecting rows 6 to 12 and columns 5 to 11 from the input grid.\n   - In Example 3, the output grid seems to be formed by selecting rows 13 to 19 and columns 5 to 11 from the input grid.\n\n5. **Commonality**: The commonality in the examples is that the output grid is always a 7x7 grid, and it seems to be formed by selecting a 7x7 subgrid from the input grid, starting from a specific row and column.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n\nFrom the examples, it seems that the rule involves selecting a 7x7 subgrid from the input grid. The starting row and column for this subgrid selection appear to be determined by specific patterns or values in the input grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n\nGiven the test input, we need to apply the derived rule to predict the output grid. Based on the examples, we will select a 7x7 subgrid from the input grid. Let's assume the starting point for the subgrid is determined by the presence of certain values or patterns, similar to the examples.\n\nLet's write a Python script to extract the 7x7 subgrid from the test input grid based on the observed pattern.\n\n```python\n# Define the test input grid\ninput_grid = [\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 1, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 7, 7, 7, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 7, 7, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 7, 9, 9, 9],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [6, 5, 6, 6, 6, 8, 6, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 5, 9, 5, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 5, 5, 5, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [6, 7, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 9, 9, 9, 5, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]\n]\n\n# Extract the 7x7 subgrid starting from row 11 and column 5\noutput_grid = [row[5:12] for row in input_grid[11:18]]\n\n# Print the output grid\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nThis script extracts a 7x7 subgrid from the test input grid, starting from row 11 and column 5, based on the pattern observed in the examples.

    "The previous attempt to extract the 7x7 subgrid did not yield the correct result. Let's revisit the problem and refine our approach.\n\n### Observations and Analysis:\n\n1. **Grid Size and Selection**: The output grid is consistently a 7x7 grid. The selection of rows and columns seems to be based on specific patterns or values in the input grid.\n\n2. **Pattern Recognition**: In the examples, the output grid seems to be formed by selecting rows and columns that contain certain values or patterns.

    "The previous attempts have not successfully identified the correct pattern for extracting the 7x7 subgrid. Let's switch to a more detailed textual reasoning approach to better understand the transformation rule.\n\n### Detailed Analysis:\n\n1. **Output Grid Characteristics**: The output grid is always 7x7, and it seems to be formed by selecting specific rows and columns from the input grid.\n\n2. **Pattern Recognition**: The output grid often includes rows and columns where certain numbers (like 8, 0, 1) appear prominently. This suggests that these numbers are key to determining the subgrid.\n\n3. **Example Analysis**:\n   - In Example 1, the output grid includes numbers like 8, 0, 1, and 2 prominently.\n   - In Example 2, the output grid includes numbers like 9, 0, 7, and 1 prominently.\n   - In Example 3, the output grid includes numbers like 9, 8, 1, and 5 prominently.\n\n4. **Commonality**: The commonality in the examples is that the output grid is always a 7x7 grid, and it seems to be formed by selecting a 7x7 subgrid from the input grid, starting from a specific row and column.\n\n### Hypothesis:\n\nThe rule might involve identifying a region in the input grid where certain key values (like 8, 0, 1, etc.) are concentrated and then extracting a 7x7 subgrid around this region.\n\n### Revised Approach:\n\n1. **Identify Key Values**: Look for rows and columns that contain specific key values (e.g., 8, 0, 1) that appear to be significant in the examples.\n\n2. **Extract Subgrid**: Once the key rows and columns are identified, extract the 7x7 subgrid starting from these points.\n\nLet's attempt a new approach by analyzing the input grid for specific patterns and extracting the subgrid accordingly.\n\n```python\n# Define the test input grid\ninput_grid = [\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 1, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 7, 7, 7, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 7, 7, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 7, 9, 9, 9],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [6, 5, 6, 6, 6, 8, 6, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 5, 9, 5, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 5, 5, 5, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [6, 7, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 9, 9, 9, 5, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]\n]\n\n# Function to extract a 7x7 subgrid based on specific patterns\ndef extract_subgrid(grid):\n    # Identify key rows and columns based on specific values\n    key_values = [8, 0, 1]\n    start_row, start_col = None, None\n    \n    # Find the first occurrence of key values in the grid\n    for i, row in enumerate(grid):\n        for j, value in enumerate(row):\n            if value in key_values:\n                start_row, start_col = i, j\n                break\n        if start_row is not None:\n            break\n    \n    # Ensure the subgrid is within bounds\n    if start_row is not None and start_col is not None:\n        start_row = max(0, min(start_row, len(grid) - 7))\n        start_col = max(0, min(start_col, len(grid[0]) - 7))\n        subgrid = [row[start_col:start_col+7] for row in grid[start_row:start_row+7]]\n        return subgrid\n    else:\n        return []\n\n# Extract the subgrid\noutput_grid = extract_subgrid(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output grid\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nThis script attempts to identify the starting point for the 7x7 subgrid based on the presence of key values (8, 0, 1) and extracts the subgrid accordingly.
