    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Observations from Examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - The input grid has a block of `7`s surrounded by `2`s and a `0` at position (3, 8).\n   - The output grid has additional `0`s at positions (3, 5), (3, 7), and (6, 5), (6, 7).\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - The input grid has a block of `5`s surrounded by `2`s and a `9` at position (2, 3).\n   - The output grid has additional `9`s at positions (2, 7) and (6, 3), (6, 7).\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - The input grid has a block of `4`s and `8`s surrounded by `2`s and a `4` at position (3, 5).\n   - The output grid has additional `8`s at positions (3, 3), (3, 7), and (7, 3), (7, 7).\n\n### Common Rule:\nThe rule seems to involve mirroring or reflecting certain numbers across the center of the grid. Specifically, the numbers that are not `2` are mirrored across both the horizontal and vertical axes that pass through the center of the grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\nLet's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- Identify the non-`2` numbers and their positions.\n- Mirror these numbers across the center axes of the grid.\n\n### Test Input Analysis:\n- Non-`2` numbers are `1` and `0`.\n- Positions of `1`: (2, 5), (4, 4), (4, 6)\n- Positions of `0`: (3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 7), (5, 4), (5, 6), (5, 7)\n\n### Mirroring:\n- Mirror `1` at (2, 5) to (2, 9) and (6, 5).\n- Mirror `1` at (4, 4) to (4, 8) and (8, 4).\n- Mirror `1` at (4, 6) to (4, 8) and (8, 6).\n- Mirror `0` at (3, 4) to (3, 8) and (7, 4).\n- Mirror `0` at (3, 6) to (3, 8) and (7, 6).\n- Mirror `0` at (3, 7) to (3, 9) and (7, 7).\n- Mirror `0` at (5, 4) to (5, 8) and (9, 4).\n- Mirror `0` at (5, 6) to (5, 8) and (9, 6).\n- Mirror `0` at (5, 7) to (5, 9) and (9, 7).\n\n### Constructing the Output Grid:\nLet's construct the output grid based on the above mirroring.\n\n```python\n# Define the input grid\ninput_grid = [\n    [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2],\n    [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2],\n    [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2],\n    [2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2],\n    [2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2],\n    [2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2],\n    [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2],\n    [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2],\n    [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2],\n    [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\n]\n\n# Initialize the output grid with the same values as the input grid\noutput_grid = [row[:] for row in input_grid]\n\n# Apply the mirroring rule\n# Mirror 1s\noutput_grid[2][9] = 1\noutput_grid[6][5] = 1\noutput_grid[4][8] = 1\noutput_grid[8][4] = 1\noutput_grid[8][6] = 1\n\n# Mirror 0s\noutput_grid[3][8] = 0\noutput_grid[7][4] = 0\noutput_grid[7][6] = 0\noutput_grid[7][7] = 0\noutput_grid[5][8] = 0\noutput_grid[9][4] = 0\noutput_grid[9][6] = 0\noutput_grid[9][7] = 0\n\n# Print the output grid\nfor row in output_grid:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output grid.",
