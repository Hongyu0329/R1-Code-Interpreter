    "The previous attempts have not successfully captured the transformation rule. Let's switch to a more detailed textual reasoning approach to identify the correct pattern.\n\n### Observations:\n1. **Output Grid Size**: The output grid is always 3 rows, and the number of columns is consistently 6, regardless of the input grid's width.\n2. **Pattern in Output**:\n   - The first row of the output grid often starts with a '1' and ends with a '3'.\n   - The second row of the output grid is filled with '8's.\n   - The third row of the output grid often starts with a '1' and ends with a '3'.\n\n3. **Position of '1' and '3'**:\n   - The '1' in the first row appears after a sequence of '9's in the input grid.\n   - The '3' in the first row appears after a sequence of '8's following the '9's.\n   - The '1' in the third row appears after a sequence of '9's in the input grid.\n   - The '3' in the third row appears after a sequence of '8's following the '9's.\n\n### Hypothesis:\n- The first row of the output grid starts with '1' after the first sequence of '9's in the input grid and ends with '3' after the first sequence of '8's following the '9's.\n- The second row is filled with '8's.\n- The third row follows a similar pattern to the first row.\n\n### Revised Approach:\nLet's apply this understanding to predict the output grid for the test input.\n\n1. **Identify the first sequence of '9's** in the input grid.\n2. **Place '1'** in the first and third rows of the output grid after this sequence.\n3. **Identify the first sequence of '8's** following the '9's.\n4. **Place '3'** in the first and third rows of the output grid after this sequence.\n5. Fill the second row with '8's.\n\n### Applying the Rule:\nGiven the input grid, let's manually apply the rule:\n\n- The first sequence of '9's in the input grid is at the start.\n- The first sequence of '8's following the '9's is immediately after the '9's.\n\nThus, the output grid should be:\n\n```\n1 8 8 3 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8\n1 8 8 3 8 8\n```\n\nThis matches the pattern observed in the examples.
