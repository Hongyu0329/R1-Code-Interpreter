    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Observations:\n1. **Pattern of 7s**: In each example, the output grid seems to focus on the pattern of 7s in the input grid. The 7s in the input grid are preserved in the output grid, and they seem to form a specific pattern.\n2. **Output Grid Size**: The output grid is larger than the input grid, suggesting that the pattern of 7s is repeated or extended in some way.\n3. **Repetition**: The output grid appears to repeat a certain pattern of 7s and 9s. This pattern seems to be a 3x3 block that is repeated vertically.\n\n### Hypothesis:\n- The output grid is constructed by identifying the pattern of 7s in the input grid and then repeating this pattern in a 3x3 block format.\n- The 7s in the input grid are used to form a 3x3 block, and this block is repeated to form the output grid.\n\n### Test Input Analysis:\nGiven the test input grid, we need to apply the identified rule to predict the output grid.\n\n#### Test Input:\n```\n9 9 9 9 2 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 2 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n7 7 7 9 9 9 9 9 9\n7 9 7 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 7 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n```\n\n- The pattern of 7s in the input grid is:\n  ```\n  7 7 7\n  7 9 7\n  9 7 9\n  ```\n\n- This pattern is repeated to form the output grid.\n\n### Constructing the Output Grid:\nLet's construct the output grid by repeating the identified pattern of 7s.\n\n```python\n# Define the pattern of 7s identified in the input grid\npattern = [\n    [7, 7, 7],\n    [7, 9, 7],\n    [9, 7, 9]\n]\n\n# Repeat the pattern to form the output grid\noutput_grid = []\nfor _ in range(3):  # Repeat vertically\n    for row in pattern:\n        output_grid.append(row)\n\n# Print the output grid\nfor row in output_grid:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nExecuting this code will generate the output grid based on the identified pattern.",
    "The code execution result shows that the output grid is correctly generated based on the identified pattern of 7s. However, the output grid does not match the expected format of the examples provided. This suggests that the rule I initially hypothesized might not be entirely correct or complete.\n\n### Re-evaluating the Rule:\nLet's re-evaluate the examples to ensure we have the correct transformation rule:\n\n1. **Pattern of 7s**: The output grid seems to focus on the pattern of 7s in the input grid, but it also includes 9s in specific positions.\n2. **Output Grid Size**: The output grid is larger than the input grid, indicating a repetition or extension of the pattern.\n3. **Repetition and Structure**: The output grid appears to have a structured repetition of 7s and 9s, which might be more complex than a simple 3x3 block repetition.\n\n### New Hypothesis:\n- The output grid is constructed by identifying the pattern of 7s in the input grid and then repeating this pattern in a structured manner.\n- The pattern might involve a more complex arrangement of 7s and 9s, possibly influenced by the positions of 2s in the input grid.\n\n### Test Input Analysis:\nGiven the test input grid, we need to apply the revised rule to predict the output grid.\n\n#### Test Input:\n```\n9 9 9 9 2 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 2 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n7 7 7 9 9 9 9 9 9\n7 9 7 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 7 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n```\n\n- The pattern of 7s in the input grid is:\n  ```\n  7 7 7\n  7 9 7\n  9 7 9\n  ```\n\n- This pattern is repeated to form the output grid, but we need to ensure the structure matches the examples.\n\n### Constructing the Output Grid:\nLet's construct the output grid by repeating the identified pattern of 7s, ensuring the structure matches the examples.\n\n```python\n# Define the pattern of 7s identified in the input grid\npattern = [\n    [7, 7, 7],\n    [7, 9, 7],\n    [9, 7, 9]\n]\n\n# Repeat the pattern to form the output grid\noutput_grid = []\nfor _ in range(3):  # Repeat vertically\n    for row in pattern:\n        output_grid.append(row)\n\n# Print the output grid\nfor row in output_grid:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nExecuting this code will generate the output grid based on the identified pattern. If the output still does not match the expected format, further analysis of the examples may be needed to refine the rule.",
    "The previous attempts to generate the output grid based on a simple repetition of a 3x3 pattern of 7s did not yield the correct results. Let's take a more analytical approach to understand the transformation rule by examining the examples more closely.\n\n### Observations from Examples:\n1. **Focus on 7s**: The output grid seems to be constructed by focusing on the positions of 7s in the input grid.\n2. **Pattern Repetition**: The output grid is larger and seems to repeat certain patterns, but not in a straightforward manner.\n3. **Influence of 2s**: The presence of 2s in the input grid might influence the structure of the output grid, although they do not appear directly in the output.\n\n### Revised Hypothesis:\n- The output grid is constructed by identifying the pattern of 7s in the input grid and then repeating this pattern in a structured manner.\n- The pattern might involve a more complex arrangement of 7s and 9s, possibly influenced by the positions of 2s in the input grid.\n\n### Strategy:\n1.
