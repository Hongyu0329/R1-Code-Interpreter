    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Observations from Examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - The input and output grids are mostly similar, but there are some changes in the output grid.\n   - The number `3` appears in the output grid where it wasn't in the input grid.\n   - The number `1` appears in the output grid where it wasn't in the input grid.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Similar to Example 1, the output grid has additional `3`s and `1`s compared to the input grid.\n   - The `3`s and `1`s seem to appear around the `4`s in the grid.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Again, the output grid has additional `3`s and `1`s.\n   - The `3`s and `1`s are placed around the `4`s.\n\n### Hypothesis:\nThe transformation rule seems to involve adding `3`s and `1`s around the `4`s in the grid. Specifically:\n- A `3` is added to the left of a `4` if there is space.\n- A `1` is added above or below a `4` if there is space.\n\n### Applying the Rule:\nLet's apply this rule to the test input grid to predict the output grid.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    rows = len(input_grid)\n    cols = len(input_grid[0])\n    output_grid = [row[:] for row in input_grid]  # Copy the input grid\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if input_grid[r][c] == 4:\n                # Check left for adding 3\n                if c > 0 and input_grid[r][c-1] == 0:\n                    output_grid[r][c-1] = 3\n                # Check above for adding 1\n                if r > 0 and input_grid[r-1][c] == 0:\n                    output_grid[r-1][c] = 1\n                # Check below for adding 1\n                if r < rows - 1 and input_grid[r+1][c] == 0:\n                    output_grid[r+1][c] = 1\n\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 4, 4, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 6, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 6, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nfor row in output_grid:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to see the predicted output grid.",
    "The code execution result shows that the transformation rule applied was not entirely correct, as the output grid does not match the expected pattern observed in the examples. Let's refine our approach by analyzing the examples more closely and adjusting the transformation rule.\n\n### Observations and Adjustments:\n\n1. **Placement of `3`s and `1`s:**\n   - The `3`s are placed to the left of `4`s if there is space.\n   - The `1`s are placed above or below `4`s if there is space.\n\n2. **Refinement:**\n   - Ensure that `3`s and `1`s are only placed in positions that were `0` in the input grid.\n   - Avoid placing `3`s and `1`s in positions that already have non-zero values in the input grid.\n\n### Revised Approach:\nLet's revise the code to ensure that `3`s and `1`s are placed correctly according to the refined rules.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    rows = len(input_grid)\n    cols = len(input_grid[0])\n    output_grid = [row[:] for row in input_grid]  # Copy the input grid\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if input_grid[r][c] == 4:\n                # Check left for adding 3\n                if c > 0 and input_grid[r][c-1] == 0:\n                    output_grid[r][c-1] = 3\n                # Check above for adding 1\n                if r > 0 and input_grid[r-1][c] == 0:\n                    output_grid[r-1][c] = 1\n                # Check below for adding 1\n                if r < rows - 1 and input_grid[r+1][c] == 0:\n                    output_grid[r+1][c] = 1\n\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 4, 4, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 6, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 6, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nfor row in output_grid:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nLet's execute this revised code to see if the output grid matches the expected pattern.",
    "The current approach is not yielding the correct output, indicating that the transformation rule needs further refinement. Let's switch to a more detailed textual reasoning process to better understand the pattern and then apply a more accurate transformation.\n\n### Detailed Analysis:\n\n1. **Pattern of `3`s and `1`s:**\n   - The `3`s and `1`s are not just placed randomly around `4`s. They seem to follow a specific pattern that might be related to the arrangement of `4`s and other numbers in the grid.\n   - The placement of `3`s and `1`s might depend on the specific configuration of `4`s and other numbers like `6` and `1` in the grid.\n\n2. **Re-evaluation of Examples:**\n   - In Example 1, `3`s and `1`s are placed in a way that seems to extend certain lines or shapes formed by `4`s.\n   - In Example 2, the `3`s and `1`s appear to form a continuation or boundary around clusters of `4`s.\n   - In Example 3, the `3`s and `1`s are placed in a way that seems to create a path or boundary around certain numbers.\n\n### Hypothesis:\nThe transformation rule might involve creating boundaries or paths around clusters of `4`s, `6`s, and other numbers. The `3`s and `1`s are used to extend or complete these boundaries.\n\n### Revised Approach:\nLet's attempt to apply this refined understanding to the test input grid.
