    "To solve this problem, we need to identify a pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:**\n  ```\n  4 9 9\n  4 4 9\n  9 4 9\n  ```\n- **Output:**\n  ```\n  9 4 4\n  4 4 9\n  9 9 9\n  ```\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:**\n  ```\n  3 3 3\n  4 4 3\n  4 4 3\n  ```\n- **Output:**\n  ```\n  4 4 3\n  4 4 3\n  3 3 3\n  ```\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:**\n  ```\n  6 6 4\n  4 4 4\n  6 6 6\n  ```\n- **Output:**\n  ```\n  6 4 6\n  6 4 6\n  6 4 4\n  ```\n\n### Example 4:\n- **Input:**\n  ```\n  3 3 3\n  3 3 3\n  3 4 4\n  ```\n- **Output:**\n  ```\n  3 3 3\n  4 3 3\n  4 3 3\n  ```\n\n### Observations:\n1.
