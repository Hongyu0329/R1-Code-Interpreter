    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Observations:\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - The output grid is a 6x4 grid.\n   - The numbers in the output grid are extracted from the input grid, specifically from the bottom-left corner of the input grid.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - The output grid is a 5x4 grid.\n   - The numbers in the output grid are extracted from the input grid, specifically from the bottom-left corner of the input grid.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - The output grid is a 3x3 grid.\n   - The numbers in the output grid are extracted from the input grid, specifically from the bottom-left corner of the input grid.\n\n### Common Rule:\nFrom the examples, it seems that the output grid is extracted from the bottom-left corner of the input grid.

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n0 3 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9\n0 0 0 3 9 9 9 9 9 9\n3 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9\n0 0 1 0 9 9 0 0 3 0\n0 3 0 0 9 9 3 0 1 0\n1 0 0 3 9 9 1 0 0 0\n9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 3\n9 9 9 9 9 9 0 3 0 0\n9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 1\nOutput:\n0 0 3 0\n3 0 1 0\n1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3\n0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 1\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n9 0 0 0 0 3 0 9 9 9\n9 0 0 3 0 1 0 9 9 9\n9 0 0 1 0 0 0 9 9 9\n9 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 9\n0 3 1 0 9 0 1 0 0 9\n0 0 0 0 9 0 0 3 0 9\n0 1 1 0 9 0 0 0 0 9\n0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0\n0 3 1 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 0\n0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n9 9 9 9 9 9 0 3 1 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 3 1 1 9\n1 0 3 3 0 9 1 1 0 9\n0 3 0 3 3 9 9 9 9 9\n0 3 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9\n1 0 1 3 0 9 0 0 3 0\n3 0 0 0 0 9 0 3 3 3\n0 1 0 3 0 9 3 0 1 0\n0 3 0 0 3 9 3 3 0 3\n9 9 9 9 9 9 0 3 3 3\nOutput:\n0 3 1\n3 1 1\n1 1 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid. Predict the corresponding output grid by applying the rule you found.\nYour final answer should be the output grid enclosed in triple angle brackets, like this: <<<output grid>>>\n\nInput:\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 9 9 9 3 0 1 3 9\n9 9 9 9 9 0 3 0 0 9\n9 0 0 3 9 1 0 1 3 9\n9 3 0 1 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 1 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 0 3 1 9 9 0 0 0 0\n9 0 0 0 9 9 3 0 1 3\n9 3 0 1 9 9 0 3 0 0\n9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 1\n",
