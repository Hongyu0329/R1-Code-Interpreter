    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Observations from Example 1:\n- The number `8` in the input grid seems to be moved to a different position in the output grid.\n- The `2`s in the input grid remain in the same position in the output grid.\n- The `8` in the input grid at position (1, 6) is moved to position (4, 4) in the output grid.\n- The `8` in the input grid at position (2, 2) is moved to position (4, 6) in the output grid.\n- The `8` in the input grid at position (6, 9) is moved to position (6, 7) in the output grid.\n\n### Observations from Example 2:\n- The `8` in the input grid at position (0, 3) is moved to position (2, 5) in the output grid.\n- The `8` in the input grid at position (1, 9) is moved to position (2, 8) in the output grid.\n- The `8` in the input grid at position (4, 1) is moved to position (4, 5) in the output grid.\n- The `8` in the input grid at position (8, 6) is moved to position (5, 6) in the output grid.\n\n### Hypothesis:\n- It seems that the `8`s are moved to a new position that is shifted downwards and possibly to the right, but the exact rule needs to be determined.\n- The `2`s remain in the same position.\n\n### Testing the Hypothesis:\nLet's write a Python script to apply this transformation rule to the test input grid and predict the output grid.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    output_grid = [[0] * 10 for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if input_grid[i][j] == 2:\n                output_grid[i][j] = 2\n            elif input_grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Apply the transformation rule for 8\n                new_i = i + 2\n                new_j = j + 2\n                if new_i < 10 and new_j < 10:\n                    output_grid[new_i][new_j] = 8\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [8, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nfor row in output_grid:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to see the predicted output grid.",
    "The output grid generated by the code doesn't match the expected pattern observed in the examples. Let's re-evaluate the transformation rule for the `8`s.\n\n### Re-evaluation:\n- In Example 1, the `8` at (1, 6) moves to (4, 4), which is a shift of (3, -2).\n- The `8` at (2, 2) moves to (4, 6), which is a shift of (2, 4).\n- The `8` at (6, 9) moves to (6, 7), which is a shift of (0, -2).\n\n- In Example 2, the `8` at (0, 3) moves to (2, 5), which is a shift of (2, 2).\n- The `8` at (1, 9) moves to (2, 8), which is a shift of (1, -1).\n- The `8` at (4, 1) moves to (4, 5), which is a shift of (0, 4).\n- The `8` at (8, 6) moves to (5, 6), which is a shift of (-3, 0).\n\nIt seems the shifts are not consistent, but they are generally small.

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0\n0 8 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 8 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid. Predict the corresponding output grid by applying the rule you found.\nYour final answer should be the output grid enclosed in triple angle brackets, like this: <<<output grid>>>\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n8 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n",
