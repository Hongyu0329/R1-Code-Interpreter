    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Observations:\n1. **Grid Size Reduction**: The output grid is smaller than the input grid. Specifically, the output grid seems to be a 7x7 grid.\n2. **Pattern Extraction**: The output grid appears to extract certain patterns or blocks from the input grid. These blocks are not directly aligned with the input grid's edges.\n3. **Block Identification**: The blocks in the output grid seem to be extracted from specific regions of the input grid. The regions are not contiguous and seem to be selected based on certain values or patterns.\n\n### Hypothesis:\n- The output grid is formed by selecting specific 7x7 blocks from the input grid. These blocks are not necessarily contiguous and may be selected based on certain values or patterns within the input grid.\n\n### Approach:\n1. Identify the starting point of the 7x7 block in the input grid for each example.\n2. Extract the 7x7 block from the input grid based on the identified starting point.\n3. Verify if the extracted block matches the output grid for each example.\n\nLet's implement a Python script to extract the 7x7 block from the test input grid based on the identified pattern.\n\n```python\ndef extract_7x7_block(input_grid):\n    # Based on the examples, the starting point for the 7x7 block seems to be around the middle of the grid.\n    # Let's assume the starting point is (4, 4) for this test input.\n    start_row, start_col = 4, 4\n    output_grid = []\n    for i in range(7):\n        row = input_grid[start_row + i][start_col:start_col + 7]\n        output_grid.append(row)\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = [\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 1, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 7, 7, 7, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 7, 7, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 7, 9, 9, 9],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [6, 5, 6, 6, 6, 8, 6, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 5, 9, 5, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 5, 5, 5, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [6, 7, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 9, 9, 9, 5, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]\n]\n\noutput_grid = extract_7x7_block(input_grid)\nfor row in output_grid:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nThis script extracts a 7x7 block from the test input grid starting at position (4, 4). Let's see the output.",
    "The output from the code indicates that the extracted 7x7 block does not match the expected pattern from the examples. This suggests that the starting point or the selection criteria for the block might be incorrect. Let's refine our approach by analyzing the examples more closely to identify a more accurate rule for selecting the 7x7 block.\n\n### Revised Observations:\n1. **Pattern Matching**: The output grid seems to capture specific patterns or values from the input grid, possibly focusing on non-9 values or certain clusters.\n2. **Dynamic Starting Point**: The starting point for the 7x7 block might not be fixed and could depend on the distribution of certain values in the input grid.\n\n### Revised Approach:\n1.
