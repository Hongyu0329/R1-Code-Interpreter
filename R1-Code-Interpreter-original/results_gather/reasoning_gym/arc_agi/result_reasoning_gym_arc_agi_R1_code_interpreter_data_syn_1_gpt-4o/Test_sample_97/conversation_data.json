    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. In each example, the output grid is a 2x2 grid.\n2. The numbers in the output grid are consistent within each example.\n3. The numbers in the output grid seem to be extracted from a specific pattern in the input grid.\n\nObservations:\n- The output grid seems to be derived from a specific row in the input grid.\n- The row that influences the output grid is the one that contains a sequence of numbers followed by a '1'.\n- The numbers in the output grid are the numbers that appear before the '1' in that specific row.\n\nLet's verify this hypothesis with the examples:\n- In Example 1, the row with '4 4 4 4 1' results in an output of '4 4\\n4 4'.\n- In Example 2, the row with '4 4 4 4 1' results in an output of '4 4\\n4 4'.\n- In Example 3, the row with '9 9 9 9 1' results in an output of '9 9\\n9 9'.\n- In Example 4, the row with '4 4 4 4 1' results in an output of '4 4\\n4 4'.\n\nThe rule seems to be:\n- Identify the row that contains a sequence of numbers followed by a '1'.\n- The numbers before the '1' in that row form the 2x2 output grid.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n```python\ndef find_output_grid(input_grid):\n    for row in input_grid:\n        if 1 in row:\n            index_of_1 = row.index(1)\n            if index_of_1 >= 2:\n                return [[row[index_of_1 - 2], row[index_of_1 - 1]],\n                        [row[index_of_1 - 2], row[index_of_1 - 1]]]\n\ninput_grid = [\n    [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9],\n    [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 8, 8, 4, 4, 4],\n    [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]\n]\n\noutput_grid = find_output_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the output grid for the test input.",
