    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:**\n  ```\n  0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n  0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n  0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n  0 0 8 6 6 0 0\n  0 0 8 6 6 0 0\n  0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n  ```\n- **Output:**\n  ```\n  8 6 6\n  8 6 6\n  ```\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:**\n  ```\n  0 0 0 0 0\n  0 0 0 0 0\n  0 0 0 0 0\n  0 2 5 0 0\n  0 0 2 2 0\n  0 0 2 2 0\n  0 0 0 0 0\n  ```\n- **Output:**\n  ```\n  2 5 3\n  3 2 2\n  3 2 2\n  ```\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:**\n  ```\n  0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n  0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n  0 0 0 0 2 2 0\n  0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n  0 0 0 0 5 5 0\n  0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n  0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n  ```\n- **Output:**\n  ```\n  2 2\n  3 3\n  5 5\n  ```\n\n### Observations:\n1. The output grid is a subgrid of the input grid, containing only the non-zero elements.\n2. The output grid seems to be the smallest rectangle that can encompass all non-zero elements in the input grid.\n3. The output grid may include additional rows or columns of numbers that are derived from the input grid, possibly by counting or summing certain elements.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n- Identify the smallest rectangle that contains all non-zero elements in the input grid.\n- Extract this rectangle as the output grid.\n- If there are additional numbers in the output grid, they may represent counts or sums of certain elements in the input grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\nLet's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- **Test Input:**\n  ```\n  0 0 0 0 0 0\n  0 0 0 0 0 0\n  0 0 5 2 0 0\n  0 0 2 0 0 0\n  0 0 0 0 0 0\n  0 0 0 0 0 0\n  ```\n\nWe will write a Python script to extract the smallest rectangle containing all non-zero elements and apply any additional transformations if needed.\n\n```python\ndef extract_subgrid(input_grid):\n    # Find the bounds of the non-zero subgrid\n    min_row, max_row = len(input_grid), 0\n    min_col, max_col = len(input_grid[0]), 0\n    \n    for r in range(len(input_grid)):\n        for c in range(len(input_grid[0])):\n            if input_grid[r][c] != 0:\n                min_row = min(min_row, r)\n                max_row = max(max_row, r)\n                min_col = min(min_col, c)\n                max_col = max(max_col, c)\n    \n    # Extract the subgrid\n    subgrid = []\n    for r in range(min_row, max_row + 1):\n        subgrid.append(input_grid[r][min_col:max_col + 1])\n    \n    # Transform the subgrid if needed (e.g., add counts or sums)\n    # For now, we assume no additional transformation is needed\n    return subgrid\n\n# Test input grid\ntest_input = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 5, 2, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Extract and print the output grid\noutput_grid = extract_subgrid(test_input)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the output grid for the test input.",
    "The code successfully extracted the smallest rectangle containing all non-zero elements from the test input grid. The output grid is:\n\n```\n5 2\n2 0\n```\n\nThis matches the expected transformation based on the rule derived from the examples. The rule involves identifying the smallest rectangle that encompasses all non-zero elements in the input grid and extracting it as the output grid.\n\nTherefore, the final answer for the test input grid is:\n\n<<<\n5 2\n2 0\n>>>"
