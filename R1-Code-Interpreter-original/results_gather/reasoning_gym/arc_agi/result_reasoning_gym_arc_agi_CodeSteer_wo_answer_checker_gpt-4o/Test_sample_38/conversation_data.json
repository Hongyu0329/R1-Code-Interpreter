    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1 Analysis:**\n   - The row with `9 9 9` in the input grid is shifted to the right by 3 columns in the output grid.\n   - The row with `6 9 6 9 6` in the input grid is shifted to the right by 3 columns in the output grid.\n\n2. **Example 2 Analysis:**\n   - The rows with `9 9 9` and `9 6 9` in the input grid are shifted to the right by 3 columns in the output grid.\n   - The row with `6` remains in the same position.\n\n3. **Example 3 Analysis:**\n   - The row with `9 9 9` in the input grid is shifted to the right by 5 columns in the output grid.\n   - The row with `6 9 6 9 6` in the input grid is shifted to the right by 5 columns in the output grid.\n\nFrom these observations, we can deduce that the transformation involves shifting the rows containing `9` to the right by a certain number of columns, while the rows containing `6` remain in the same position. The number of columns to shift seems to depend on the position of the `9` in the input grid.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- Identify the rows containing `9` and shift them to the right by 3 columns.\n- Keep the rows containing `6` in the same position.\n\nApplying this rule, the output grid will be:\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nNow, let's provide the output grid in the required format:\n\n<<<\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n>>>",

Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 9 9 9 0 0 0\n6 9 6 9 6 0 6\n0 9 9 9 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 9 9 9 0\n6 0 6 9 6 9 6\n0 0 0 9 9 9 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 9 9 9 0 0\n0 0 9 6 9 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 0 0\n0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 0 0\n0 0 9 6 9 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 0 0\n0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n6 0 6 9 6 9 6 0 6 0 6 0 6\n0 0 0 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0\n6 0 6 0 6 9 6 9 6 0 6 0 6\n0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.

    "The current analysis and solution provided by the TaskLLM do not correctly apply the transformation rule observed in the examples. The output grid generated does not reflect the expected shifts of rows containing `9`. Please re-evaluate the transformation rule by considering the consistent pattern of shifting rows with `9` to the right by a specific number of columns, as observed in the examples. Ensure that the rule is applied consistently across all rows in the test input grid. Consider using a more systematic approach to identify and apply the shifts, possibly involving symbolic computing or efficient searching to determine the correct number of columns to shift each row.",
    "The current code attempts to apply a transformation rule but does not correctly implement the observed pattern from the examples. The output grid does not reflect the expected shifts of rows containing `9`. Please refine the approach by ensuring that the shift amount is consistently applied based on the examples. Consider using a more sophisticated method to determine the shift amount, possibly involving symbolic computing or a more efficient searching strategy to accurately capture the transformation pattern. Focus on ensuring that the rows containing `9` are shifted correctly, and verify the output against the expected results from the examples.",
