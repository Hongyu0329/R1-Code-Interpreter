    "To tackle the complexity of the transformation rules, we can consider a more sophisticated approach that involves machine learning or advanced pattern recognition techniques. However, given the constraints of this environment, I'll outline a more detailed plan and provide a refined implementation that attempts to capture the complexity of the transformation rules using a rule-based approach.\n\n### Plan\n\n1. **Pattern Recognition:**\n   - Use a sliding window to analyze local patterns in the grid.\n   - Identify specific configurations such as lines, blocks, or clusters of numbers that influence the transformation.\n\n2. **Contextual Transformation Rules:**\n   - Develop rules that consider the position of numbers within identified patterns.\n   - Use conditional logic to apply different transformations based on the detected pattern and its context.\n\n3. **Symbolic Representation:**\n   - Represent complex patterns and transformations using symbolic computing.\n   - Create a symbolic map of the grid to guide the transformation process.\n\n4. **Efficient Search and Application:**\n   - Use efficient data structures to facilitate quick pattern matching and rule application.\n   - Implement a search algorithm that efficiently detects patterns and applies the corresponding transformation rules.\n\n### Implementation\n\nLet's implement a Python function that incorporates these ideas. This function will be more sophisticated and will involve advanced pattern recognition and context-aware transformation logic.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Define the dimensions of the grid\n    rows, cols = len(input_grid), len(input_grid[0])\n    \n    # Initialize the output grid\n    output_grid = [[0] * cols for _ in range(rows)]\n    \n    # Function to determine the transformation for a given cell\n    def transform_cell(i, j):\n        # If the cell is not 8, it might map directly or based on a pattern\n        if input_grid[i][j] != 8:\n            return input_grid[i][j]\n        \n        # Analyze the surrounding cells to determine the pattern\n        surrounding = []\n        for di in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            for dj in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                if 0 <= ni < rows and 0 <= nj < cols and (di != 0 or dj != 0):\n                    surrounding.append(input_grid[ni][nj])\n        \n        # Advanced pattern recognition logic\n        # Example: Check for specific configurations or shapes\n        # This is a placeholder for more complex logic\n        if surrounding.count(2) > 4:\n            return 1\n        elif surrounding.count(9) > 4:\n            return 9\n        elif surrounding.count(0) > 4:\n            return 0\n        else:\n            # Default transformation (could be more complex)\n            return max(set(surrounding), key=surrounding.count)\n    \n    # Apply the transformation to each cell\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            output_grid[i][j] = transform_cell(i, j)\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = [\n    [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n    [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 4, 8, 2, 8],\n    [8, 8, 9, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8],\n    [2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 8, 8, 2, 2, 8],\n    [8, 8, 2, 2, 8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8],\n    [8, 7, 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]\n]\n\n# Transform the input grid\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output grid\nfor row in output_grid:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nThis code attempts to incorporate more advanced pattern recognition and context-aware transformation logic. The logic can be further refined to capture more complex patterns and rules observed in the examples. The placeholder logic for pattern recognition should be replaced with more sophisticated algorithms as needed. If you have access to machine learning tools, you could train a model to learn these transformations from the examples."
