    "To solve this problem, we need to identify a pattern or rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. **Example 1 Analysis:**\n   - The output grid is a 7x7 section of the input grid.\n   - The section seems to be extracted from the bottom-right corner of the input grid.\n\n2. **Example 2 Analysis:**\n   - Similarly, the output grid is a 7x7 section from the bottom-right corner of the input grid.\n\n3. **Example 3 Analysis:**\n   - Again, the output grid is a 7x7 section from the bottom-right corner of the input grid.\n\nFrom these observations, the rule appears to be that the output grid is a 7x7 subgrid extracted from the bottom-right corner of the input grid.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- The input grid is 17x16.\n- We need to extract a 7x7 grid from the bottom-right corner.\n\nLet's write the Python code to extract this subgrid:\n\n```python\ndef extract_subgrid(input_grid):\n    # Extract the last 7 rows and the last 7 columns\n    return [row[-7:] for row in input_grid[-7:]]\n\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = [\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 1, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 7, 7, 7, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 7, 7, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 7, 9, 9, 9],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [6, 5, 6, 6, 6, 8, 6, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 5, 9, 5, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 5, 5, 5, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [6, 7, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 9, 9, 9, 5, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]\n]\n\noutput_grid = extract_subgrid(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output grid\nfor row in output_grid:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nThe output grid will be:\n\n```\n9 9 9 9 9 7 9\n9 9 9 9 7 7 9\n9 9 9 9 9 7 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 5 9 5 9 9\n9 5 5 5 9 9 9\n9 9 9 5 9 9 9\n```\n\nThus, the final output grid is:\n\n<<<\n9 9 9 9 9 7 9\n9 9 9 9 7 7 9\n9 9 9 9 9 7 9\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n9 9 5 9 5 9 9\n9 5 5 5 9 9 9\n9 9 9 5 9 9 9\n>>>",

We'll attempt to identify any potential transformations or relationships in the grid:\n\n```python\ndef analyze_grid(input_grid):\n    # Analyze the grid for patterns\n    # For simplicity, let's check for symmetry and repeating sequences\n    n = len(input_grid)\n    m = len(input_grid[0])\n    \n    # Check for horizontal symmetry\n    horizontal_symmetry = all(input_grid[i] == input_grid[n-i-1] for i in range(n//2))\n    \n    # Check for vertical symmetry\n    vertical_symmetry = all(row[j] == row[m-j-1] for row in input_grid for j in range(m//2))\n    \n    # Check for repeating sequences in rows\n    repeating_rows = any(row.count(row[0]) == len(row) for row in input_grid)\n    \n    # Check for repeating sequences in columns\n    repeating_columns = any(all(input_grid[i][j] == input_grid[0][j] for i in range(n)) for j in range(m))\n    \n    # Print findings\n    print(\"Horizontal Symmetry:\", horizontal_symmetry)\n    print(\"Vertical Symmetry:\", vertical_symmetry)\n    print(\"Repeating Rows:\", repeating_rows)\n    print(\"Repeating Columns:\", repeating_columns)\n\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = [\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 1, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 7, 7, 7, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 7, 7, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 7, 9, 9, 9],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [6, 5, 6, 6, 6, 8, 6, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 5, 9, 5, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 5, 5, 5, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [6, 7, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 9, 9, 9, 5, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]\n]\n\nanalyze_grid(input_grid)\n```\n\nThis code checks for basic patterns like symmetry and repeating sequences. While it doesn't directly solve the problem, it provides insights into potential patterns that could be explored further. If any of these patterns are detected, they might suggest a more complex rule for transforming the grid.",
    "To develop a more advanced solution, we need to delve deeper into the problem and consider more complex transformations or relationships within the grid. Let's break down the task and explore a more sophisticated approach:\n\n### Task Breakdown\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We have input grids and corresponding output grids.\n   - The task is to identify a rule or transformation that maps the input grid to the output grid.\n\n2. **Analyze the Examples:**\n   - The output grid is consistently a 7x7 section of the input grid.\n   - The section is not always from the same position, suggesting a more complex rule than simple extraction.\n\n3. **Identify Potential Patterns:**\n   - Look for specific numbers or sequences that might indicate the starting point of the 7x7 grid.\n   - Consider transformations like rotations, reflections, or shifts.\n\n4. **Develop a Strategy:**\n   - Use symbolic reasoning to identify potential rules.\n   - Implement a search algorithm to explore different sections of the grid.\n\n### Advanced Approach\n\nGiven the complexity, let's focus on a strategy that involves searching for a specific pattern or sequence that might indicate the starting point of the 7x7 grid. We'll use Python to implement this approach:\n\n```python\ndef find_subgrid(input_grid):\n    n = len(input_grid)\n    m = len(input_grid[0])\n    \n    # Define the size of the output grid\n    subgrid_size = 7\n    \n    # Iterate over possible starting points for the 7x7 grid\n    for i in range(n - subgrid_size + 1):\n        for j in range(m - subgrid_size + 1):\n            # Extract a potential 7x7 subgrid\n            subgrid = [row[j:j + subgrid_size] for row in input_grid[i:i + subgrid_size]]\n            \n            # Check if this subgrid matches any known pattern or rule\n            # For simplicity, let's assume we have a function `matches_pattern` that checks this\n            if matches_pattern(subgrid):\n                return subgrid\n    \n    # If no matching subgrid is found, return None\n    return None\n\ndef matches_pattern(subgrid):\n    # Placeholder function to check if a subgrid matches a known pattern\n    # This function should be implemented based on the specific patterns identified\n    return True  # For now, assume any subgrid is valid\n\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = [\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 9, 1, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 9, 1, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 7, 7, 7, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 7, 7, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 7, 9, 9, 9],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [6, 5, 6, 6, 6, 8, 6, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 5, 9, 5, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 5, 5, 5, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [6, 7, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 9, 9, 9, 5, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]\n]\n\noutput_grid = find_subgrid(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output grid\nif output_grid:\n    for row in output_grid:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\nelse:\n    print(\"No matching subgrid found.\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Pattern Matching:** The `matches_pattern` function is a placeholder for checking if a subgrid matches a known pattern. This function should be implemented based on specific patterns identified from the examples.\n\n- **Search Algorithm:** The `find_subgrid` function iterates over possible starting points for a 7x7 subgrid and checks each one against the `matches_pattern` function.\n\n- **Output:** If a matching subgrid is found, it is printed; otherwise, a message is displayed indicating no match was found.\n\nThis approach provides a framework for exploring more complex transformations and relationships within the grid. The key is to implement the `matches_pattern` function based on insights gained from analyzing the examples."
