    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. In each example, the output grid is a 2x2 grid.\n2. The numbers in the output grid are derived from the numbers in the input grid.\n3. The output grid seems to be formed by selecting a specific 2x2 block from the input grid.\n\nBy examining the examples, we can observe the following pattern:\n- The output grid is formed by selecting the 2x2 block that is located in the bottom left corner of the input grid, just above the row with the number '1' in the middle column.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\nTest Input:\n```\n8 8 8 8 8 1 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 1 8 8 8 8 8\n8 9 9 9 9 1 8 8 8 9 9\n8 8 8 8 8 1 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 1 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 1 8 8 8 8 8\n8 4 4 4 4 1 8 8 4 4 4\n8 8 8 8 8 1 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 1 8 8 8 8 8\n```\n\nAccording to the rule, we need to select the 2x2 block from the row with '4's and the row above it, in the leftmost columns. This gives us:\n\n```\n9 9\n9 9\n```\n\nThus, the output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<9 9\n9 9>>>",
    "To create a more robust solution that can dynamically identify the pattern and extract the correct 2x2 block, we can implement a Python function that searches for the 2x2 block based on the observed pattern. The function will iterate over the grid to find the row with the number '1' in the middle column and then extract the 2x2 block from the rows above it.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan for the implementation:\n\n1. Parse the input grid into a 2D list for easier manipulation.\n2. Identify the column index of the number '1' in the middle of the grid.\n3. Iterate over the grid to find the row with '1' in the identified column.\n4. Extract the 2x2 block from the rows above the identified row.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef extract_2x2_block(grid):\n    # Convert the input grid into a 2D list\n    grid = [list(map(int, row.split())) for row in grid.strip().split('\\n')]\n    \n    # Find the column index of '1' in the middle of the grid\n    middle_col = len(grid[0]) // 2\n    \n    # Iterate over the grid to find the row with '1' in the middle column\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        if grid[i][middle_col] == 1:\n            # Extract the 2x2 block from the rows above the identified row\n            return [[grid[i-2][0], grid[i-2][1]], [grid[i-1][0], grid[i-1][1]]]\n\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = \"\"\"\n8 8 8 8 8 1 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 1 8 8 8 8 8\n8 9 9 9 9 1 8 8 8 9 9\n8 8 8 8 8 1 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 1 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 1 8 8 8 8 8\n8 4 4 4 4 1 8 8 4 4 4\n8 8 8 8 8 1 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 1 8 8 8 8 8\n\"\"\"\n\n# Extract and print the 2x2 block\noutput_block = extract_2x2_block(input_grid)\nfor row in output_block:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nThis code will dynamically identify the correct 2x2 block based on the pattern observed in the examples. It should work for similar input grids with the same structure.",
    "Let's re-evaluate the logic for identifying the correct 2x2 block. The goal is to extract the 2x2 block that is located in the bottom left corner of the input grid, just above the row with the number '1' in the middle column. \n\nTo achieve this, we need to:\n1. Identify the row where the number '1' appears in the middle column.\n2. Extract the 2x2 block from the rows above this identified row, starting from the leftmost columns.\n\nLet's add debug statements to trace the values and logic flow:\n\n```python\ndef extract_2x2_block(grid):\n    # Convert the input grid into a 2D list\n    grid = [list(map(int, row.split())) for row in grid.strip().split('\\n')]\n    \n    # Find the column index of '1' in the middle of the grid\n    middle_col = len(grid[0]) // 2\n    print(f\"Middle column index: {middle_col}\")\n    \n    # Iterate over the grid to find the row with '1' in the middle column\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        if grid[i][middle_col] == 1:\n            print(f\"Row with '1' in the middle column: {i}\")\n            # Extract the 2x2 block from the rows above the identified row\n            block = [[grid[i-1][0], grid[i-1][1]], [grid[i][0], grid[i][1]]]\n            print(f\"Extracted 2x2 block: {block}\")\n            return block\n\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = \"\"\"\n8 8 8 8 8 1 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 1 8 8 8 8 8\n8 9 9 9 9 1 8 8 8 9 9\n8 8 8 8 8 1 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 1 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 1 8 8 8 8 8\n8 4 4 4 4 1 8 8 4 4 4\n8 8 8 8 8 1 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 1 8 8 8 8 8\n\"\"\"\n\n# Extract and print the 2x2 block\noutput_block = extract_2x2_block(input_grid)\nfor row in output_block:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nThis code includes debug statements to print the middle column index, the row where '1' is found, and the extracted 2x2 block. This should help us trace the logic and ensure the correct block is being extracted. \n\nNote: The logic for extracting the block was corrected to use the row with '1' and the row above it, starting from the leftmost columns.",
    "Let's reassess the logic for identifying the correct row and extracting the 2x2 block. The key is to correctly identify the row where '1' appears in the middle column and then extract the 2x2 block from the rows above it. \n\nHere's a revised approach:\n\n1. Iterate through each row of the grid to find the row where '1' appears in the middle column.\n2. Once the row with '1' is found, extract the 2x2 block from the two rows above it, starting from the leftmost columns.\n\nLet's implement this with a more robust approach:\n\n```python\ndef extract_2x2_block(grid):\n    # Convert the input grid into a 2D list\n    grid = [list(map(int, row.split())) for row in grid.strip().split('\\n')]\n    \n    # Find the column index of '1' in the middle of the grid\n    middle_col = len(grid[0]) // 2\n    \n    # Iterate over the grid to find the row with '1' in the middle column\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        if grid[i][middle_col] == 1:\n            # Extract the 2x2 block from the rows above the identified row\n            # Ensure we have enough rows above to extract the block\n            if i >= 2:\n                block = [[grid[i-2][0], grid[i-2][1]], [grid[i-1][0], grid[i-1][1]]]\n                return block\n\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = \"\"\"\n8 8 8 8 8 1 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 1 8 8 8 8 8\n8 9 9 9 9 1 8 8 8 9 9\n8 8 8 8 8 1 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 1 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 1 8 8 8 8 8\n8 4 4 4 4 1 8 8 4 4 4\n8 8 8 8 8 1 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 1 8 8 8 8 8\n\"\"\"\n\n# Extract and print the 2x2 block\noutput_block = extract_2x2_block(input_grid)\nfor row in output_block:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nThis implementation should correctly identify the row with '1' and extract the 2x2 block from the rows above it.
