    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - The number `8` forms a border on the top and bottom rows.\n   - The number `7` forms a block in the middle of the grid.\n   - The number `2` and `1` form smaller blocks.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - The number `8` again forms a border on the top and bottom rows.\n   - The number `7` forms a block in the middle of the grid.\n   - The number `2` and `1` form smaller blocks.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - The number `8` forms a border on the top and bottom rows.\n   - The number `4` and `2` form blocks in the middle of the grid.\n   - The number `1` forms a smaller block.\n\nFrom these observations, we can deduce the following rules:\n- The number `8` always forms a border on the top and bottom rows.\n- The other numbers form blocks in the middle of the grid, with the largest number forming the largest block.\n\nNow, let's apply these rules to the test input grid:\n\n- The number `8` will form a border on the top and bottom rows.\n- The number `7` will form a block in the middle.\n- The number `4` and `2` will form smaller blocks.\n\nBased on these rules, the output grid for the test input will be:\n\n```\n8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0\n8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8\n```\n\nThus, the output grid is:\n\n<<<\n8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0\n8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8\n>>>",

Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 7 7 0 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0\nOutput:\n8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8\n0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0\n0 7 7 7 7 0 0 7 7 7 7 0 0 0\n0 7 7 7 7 0 0 7 7 7 7 0 0 0\n0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0\n0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 2 2 7 7 7 0\n0 0 0 0 2 2 2 7 7 7 0\n0 0 0 0 2 2 2 7 7 7 0\n0 1 1 1 7 7 7 7 7 7 0\n0 1 1 1 7 7 7 7 7 7 0\n0 1 1 1 7 7 7 7 7 7 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n8 0 0 0 0 0 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 4 4 0 0\n0 2 2 4 4 0 0\n0 1 1 2 2 0 0\n0 1 1 2 2 0 0\n8 0 0 0 0 0 8\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.
