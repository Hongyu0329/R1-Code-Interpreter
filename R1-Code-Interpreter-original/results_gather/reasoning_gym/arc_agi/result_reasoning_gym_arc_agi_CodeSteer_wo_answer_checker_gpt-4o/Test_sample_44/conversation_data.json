    "To solve this problem, we need to identify a pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input:\n     ```\n     4 4 4\n     4 8 8\n     4 8 8\n     ```\n   - Output:\n     ```\n     4 4 4\n     8 8 4\n     8 8 4\n     ```\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input:\n     ```\n     5 5 5\n     5 8 8\n     8 8 5\n     ```\n   - Output:\n     ```\n     8 5 5\n     8 8 5\n     5 8 5\n     ```\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input:\n     ```\n     4 4 8\n     4 4 8\n     4 4 4\n     ```\n   - Output:\n     ```\n     4 4 4\n     4 4 4\n     4 8 8\n     ```\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input:\n     ```\n     8 8 7\n     7 8 7\n     7 8 7\n     ```\n   - Output:\n     ```\n     7 7 8\n     8 8 8\n     7 7 7\n     ```\n\n**Observations:**\n- The transformation seems to involve rearranging the rows and columns based on certain conditions.\n- The first row of the output often contains the largest number from the input grid.\n- The last column of the output often contains the largest number from the input grid.\n- The middle row and column seem to be adjusted to maintain the largest number in the center of the grid.\n\n**Plan:**\n1. Identify the largest number in the input grid.\n2. Rearrange the rows and columns such that the largest number appears prominently in the first row and last column.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n- **Test Input:**\n  ```\n  1 8 8\n  1 8 8\n  8 1 8\n  ```\n\n- **Predicted Output:**\n  - The largest number is 8.\n  - Arrange the grid to have 8 prominently in the first row and last column.\n\n```python\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = [\n    [1, 8, 8],\n    [1, 8, 8],\n    [8, 1, 8]\n]\n\n# Predicted output grid based on the identified rule\noutput_grid = [\n    [8, 8, 1],\n    [8, 8, 1],\n    [8, 8, 8]\n]\n\n# Print the output grid\nfor row in output_grid:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nThe predicted output grid is:\n```\n8 8 1\n8 8 1\n8 8 8\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<8 8 1\n8 8 1\n8 8 8>>>",
    "To enhance the solution, we need to systematically analyze the grid patterns and transformations. Let's break down the problem further and consider a more sophisticated approach:\n\n### Observations and Analysis\n\n1. **Identify Patterns:**\n   - The output grid seems to be a rearrangement of the input grid based on certain rules.\n   - The largest number in the input grid often appears prominently in the output grid.\n\n2. **Transformation Rules:**\n   - The first row of the output grid often contains the largest number from the input grid.\n   - The last column of the output grid often contains the largest number from the input grid.\n   - The middle elements are adjusted to maintain the largest number in the center of the grid.\n\n3. **Systematic Approach:**\n   - Identify the largest number in the input grid.\n   - Rearrange the grid such that the largest number appears prominently in the first row and last column.\n   - Ensure that the middle elements are adjusted to maintain the largest number in the center.\n\n### Plan\n\n1. **Find the Largest Number:**\n   - Traverse the grid to find the largest number.\n\n2. **Rearrange the Grid:**\n   - Place the largest number in the first row and last column.\n   - Adjust the middle elements to maintain the largest number in the center.\n\n3. **Implement the Transformation:**\n   - Use symbolic computing to identify and apply transformation rules.\n\nLet's implement this enhanced approach in Python:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the largest number in the grid\n    largest_number = max(max(row) for row in input_grid)\n    \n    # Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions\n    output_grid = [[0] * len(input_grid[0]) for _ in range(len(input_grid))]\n    \n    # Place the largest number in the first row and last column\n    for i in range(len(input_grid)):\n        for j in range(len(input_grid[0])):\n            if i == 0 or j == len(input_grid[0]) - 1:\n                output_grid[i][j] = largest_number\n            else:\n                # Fill the remaining positions with the corresponding input values\n                output_grid[i][j] = input_grid[i][j]\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = [\n    [1, 8, 8],\n    [1, 8, 8],\n    [8, 1, 8]\n]\n\n# Transform the grid\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output grid\nfor row in output_grid:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Finding the Largest Number:** We traverse the grid to find the largest number.\n- **Rearranging the Grid:** We place the largest number in the first row and last column. The remaining positions are filled with the corresponding input values.\n- **Output:** The transformed grid is printed.\n\nThis approach systematically analyzes the grid and applies transformation rules to achieve the desired output."

    "The current solution seems to be based on a simple observation of rearranging the grid based on the largest number. However, the complexity analysis suggests that the code lacks symbolic computing or efficient searching. To improve the solution, consider implementing a more sophisticated algorithm that systematically analyzes the grid patterns and transformations. This could involve using symbolic computing to identify and apply transformation rules more effectively. Try to enhance the code by incorporating these elements to ensure a more robust solution."
