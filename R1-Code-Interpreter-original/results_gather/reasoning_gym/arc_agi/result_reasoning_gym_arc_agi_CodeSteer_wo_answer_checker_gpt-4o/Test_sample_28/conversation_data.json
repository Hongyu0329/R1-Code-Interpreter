    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n### Observations:\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input numbers that are not 6: 3, 1, 5, 2, 7, 0, 4\n   - Output grid: \n     ```\n     4 0 3\n     6 7 1\n     6 2 5\n     ```\n   - The numbers in the output grid are the non-6 numbers from the input grid, rearranged.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input numbers that are not 6: 4, 5, 0, 1, 3, 9, 0, 9, 1\n   - Output grid:\n     ```\n     0 9 4\n     9 3 5\n     1 1 0\n     ```\n   - Again, the numbers in the output grid are the non-6 numbers from the input grid, rearranged.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input numbers that are not 6: 1, 9, 7, 2, 8, 3\n   - Output grid:\n     ```\n     6 3 1\n     6 8 9\n     6 2 7\n     ```\n   - The numbers in the output grid are the non-6 numbers from the input grid, rearranged.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe output grid is formed by taking all the non-6 numbers from the input grid and arranging them in a specific order. The order seems to be based on the sequence they appear in the input grid, but rearranged into a 3x3 grid.\n\n### Plan:\n1. Extract all non-6 numbers from the input grid.\n2. Arrange these numbers into a 3x3 grid.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid.\n\n```python\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = [\n    [6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 4, 6, 6, 6],\n    [3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6],\n    [6, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 6],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 6, 6]\n]\n\n# Extract non-6 numbers\nnon_six_numbers = [num for row in input_grid for num in row if num != 6]\n\n# Arrange into a 3x3 grid\noutput_grid = [\n    non_six_numbers[0:3],\n    non_six_numbers[3:6],\n    non_six_numbers[6:9]\n]\n\n# Print the output grid\nprint(\"<<<\")\nfor row in output_grid:\n    print(\" \".join(map(str, row)))\nprint(\">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will extract the non-6 numbers from the input grid and arrange them into a 3x3 grid, which is the predicted output grid.",
    "Let's take a closer look at the examples to determine the exact order in which the non-6 numbers are arranged in the output grid.\n\n### Observations:\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input non-6 numbers: 3, 1, 5, 2, 7, 0, 4\n   - Output grid:\n     ```\n     4 0 3\n     6 7 1\n     6 2 5\n     ```\n   - The numbers appear to be arranged in a specific order that is not simply the order of appearance.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input non-6 numbers: 4, 5, 0, 1, 3, 9, 0, 9, 1\n   - Output grid:\n     ```\n     0 9 4\n     9 3 5\n     1 1 0\n     ```\n   - Again, the numbers are arranged in a specific order.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input non-6 numbers: 1, 9, 7, 2, 8, 3\n   - Output grid:\n     ```\n     6 3 1\n     6 8 9\n     6 2 7\n     ```\n   - The numbers are arranged in a specific order.\n\n### Analysis:\nUpon closer inspection, it seems that the numbers are arranged in a spiral order starting from the top-left corner of the 3x3 grid. The spiral order is as follows:\n- Start from the top-left corner and move right.\n- Move down the rightmost column.\n- Move left along the bottom row.\n- Move up the leftmost column.\n- Continue inward in a spiral pattern.\n\n### Plan:\n1. Extract all non-6 numbers from the input grid.\n2. Arrange these numbers in a spiral order in a 3x3 grid.\n\nLet's implement this in the code:\n\n```python\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = [\n    [6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 4, 6, 6, 6],\n    [3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6],\n    [6, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 6],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 2, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 9, 6, 6]\n]\n\n# Extract non-6 numbers\nnon_six_numbers = [num for row in input_grid for num in row if num != 6]\n\n# Arrange in spiral order\noutput_grid = [[0]*3 for _ in range(3)]\npositions = [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 1), (2, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1)]\n\nfor pos, num in zip(positions, non_six_numbers):\n    output_grid[pos[0]][pos[1]] = num\n\n# Print the output grid\nprint(\"<<<\")\nfor row in output_grid:\n    print(\" \".join(map(str, row)))\nprint(\">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will arrange the non-6 numbers in a spiral order in the 3x3 grid, which should match the pattern observed in the examples."

    "The current solution correctly identifies the pattern of extracting non-6 numbers and arranging them into a 3x3 grid. However, the order of arrangement in the output grid seems to be incorrect. Analyze the examples more closely to determine the exact order in which the non-6 numbers should be placed in the output grid. Consider if there is a specific pattern or rule in the arrangement of numbers in the output grid that has not been captured yet. Once identified, adjust the code to reflect this pattern."
