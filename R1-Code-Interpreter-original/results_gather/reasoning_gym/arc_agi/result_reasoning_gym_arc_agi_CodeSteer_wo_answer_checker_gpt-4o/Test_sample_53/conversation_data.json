    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid. By examining the examples provided, we can observe the following:\n\n1. The output grid seems to be a smaller grid extracted from the input grid.\n2. The output grid appears to be a 9x10 grid in the first example, a 6x7 grid in the second example, and a 7x6 grid in the third example.\n3. The output grid seems to be formed by selecting specific rows and columns from the input grid.\n\nUpon closer inspection, it appears that the output grid is formed by selecting rows and columns that contain a specific number, which is the most frequent number in the input grid. In the examples, the number '4' is frequently seen in the output grid, and it is one of the most frequent numbers in the input grid.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n1. Identify the most frequent number in the input grid.\n2. Extract rows and columns that contain this number to form the output grid.\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in Python to generate the output grid for the test input.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef find_most_frequent_number(grid):\n    # Flatten the grid and count the frequency of each number\n    flat_grid = [num for row in grid for num in row]\n    frequency = Counter(flat_grid)\n    # Find the most frequent number\n    most_frequent = frequency.most_common(1)[0][0]\n    return most_frequent\n\ndef extract_grid(grid, number):\n    # Extract rows and columns that contain the most frequent number\n    rows = [row for row in grid if number in row]\n    # Transpose the grid to extract columns\n    transposed = list(zip(*grid))\n    columns = [col for col in transposed if number in col]\n    # Transpose back to get the final grid\n    final_grid = list(zip(*columns))\n    return final_grid\n\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = [\n    [9, 4, 3, 7, 0, 2, 3, 3, 5, 7, 4, 1, 7, 8, 5, 7, 9, 8, 6],\n    [8, 4, 8, 5, 9, 9, 4, 7, 4, 8, 0, 8, 7, 1, 9, 6, 6, 6, 9],\n    [9, 3, 5, 1, 5, 7, 4, 9, 0, 8, 1, 8, 4, 2, 9, 5, 9, 5, 2],\n    [0, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 6, 2, 7, 4, 4, 8],\n    [9, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 4, 4, 1, 5, 9, 3],\n    [7, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 3, 6, 9, 3, 8],\n    [1, 5, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 7, 1, 7, 6, 4, 6],\n    [0, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 7, 2, 1, 7],\n    [1, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 5, 5, 3, 6, 7, 2],\n    [5, 5, 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 7, 5, 7, 8, 9, 3],\n    [6, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 9, 8, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0],\n    [1, 9, 8, 8, 5, 3, 3, 7, 7, 4, 4, 4, 7, 8, 5, 6, 8, 0, 5],\n    [2, 0, 7, 8, 2, 1, 8, 1, 4, 8, 9, 3, 3, 5, 7, 1, 5, 3, 9],\n    [1, 3, 6, 3, 6, 7, 6, 6, 0, 6, 4, 8, 8, 9, 6, 4, 1, 2, 3],\n    [0, 2, 2, 6, 5, 8, 8, 6, 7, 2, 1, 8, 9, 1, 4, 3, 3, 1, 5],\n    [4, 1, 9, 1, 4, 5, 1, 9, 8, 3, 4, 6, 3, 0, 7, 8, 9, 2, 6],\n    [2, 9, 6, 7, 6, 2, 8, 5, 7, 4, 2, 3, 3, 9, 5, 8, 6, 5, 2]\n]\n\n# Find the most frequent number\nmost_frequent_number = find_most_frequent_number(input_grid)\n\n# Extract the output grid\noutput_grid = extract_grid(input_grid, most_frequent_number)\n\n# Print the output grid\nprint(\"<<<\")\nfor row in output_grid:\n    print(\" \".join(map(str, row)))\nprint(\">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the predicted output grid for the given test input.",
    "To solve this problem, we need to identify a more complex pattern that maps the input grid to the output grid.

    "The current approach of identifying the most frequent number and extracting rows and columns based on that number is not yielding the correct output. The task requires a more nuanced understanding of the pattern in the input and output grids. Consider analyzing the structure of the output grid in relation to the input grid more deeply. Look for patterns in the arrangement of numbers, such as repeating sequences or specific transformations applied to certain sections of the grid. Implement a more sophisticated algorithm that can capture these patterns, possibly involving symbolic computing or more advanced searching techniques.",

Look for patterns in the arrangement of numbers, such as specific sequences or transformations applied to certain rows or columns.\n\n2. **Symbolic Computing:** Implement symbolic computing techniques to model the transformation process. This might involve creating a symbolic representation of the grid and applying transformations to this representation.\n\n3. **Efficient Searching:** Use efficient searching algorithms to explore possible transformations and identify the one that matches the examples. This could involve backtracking or other search strategies to systematically explore different possibilities.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis:** Ensure that the code complexity is sufficient to capture the nuances of the transformation. The current complexity score suggests that the approach is not yet capturing the full complexity of the task.\n\nBy incorporating these elements, you can develop a more robust solution that accurately models the transformation process.",
