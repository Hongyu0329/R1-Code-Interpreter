    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1 Analysis:**\n   - Input: \n     ```\n     3 0 1 1 1\n     5 5 9 5 8\n     1 5 5 5 3\n     1 1 8 6 9\n     9 5 2 4 6\n     ```\n   - Output:\n     ```\n     3 0 5 5 5\n     1 1 9 1 8\n     5 1 1 1 3\n     5 5 8 6 9\n     9 1 2 4 6\n     ```\n   - Observations: \n     - The first row remains the same except for the third element which changes from 1 to 5.\n     - The second row changes the first element from 5 to 1 and the fourth element from 5 to 1.\n     - The third row changes the first element from 1 to 5.\n     - The fourth row changes the first element from 1 to 5.\n     - The fifth row changes the second element from 5 to 1.\n\n2. **Example 2 Analysis:**\n   - Input:\n     ```\n     9 5 6\n     5 0 5\n     1 1 3\n     ```\n   - Output:\n     ```\n     9 1 6\n     1 0 1\n     5 5 3\n     ```\n   - Observations:\n     - The first row changes the second element from 5 to 1.\n     - The second row changes the first element from 5 to 1 and the third element from 5 to 1.\n     - The third row changes the first element from 1 to 5.\n\n3. **Example 3 Analysis:**\n   - Input:\n     ```\n     6 5 2\n     8 5 1\n     3 8 4\n     ```\n   - Output:\n     ```\n     6 1 2\n     8 1 5\n     3 8 4\n     ```\n   - Observations:\n     - The first row changes the second element from 5 to 1.\n     - The second row changes the second element from 5 to 1 and the third element from 1 to 5.\n\n**Common Rule:**\n- It seems that the rule involves changing certain elements to 1 or 5 based on their position and value. Specifically:\n  - If an element is 5, it is changed to 1.\n  - If an element is 1, it is changed to 5.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\nInput:\n```\n1 1 8 5\n6 1 0 5\n6 0 2 4\n9 8 1 1\n```\n\nApplying the rule:\n- Change 1 to 5 and 5 to 1.\n\nOutput:\n```\n5 5 8 1\n6 5 0 1\n6 0 2 4\n9 8 5 5\n```\n\nThe output grid is:\n\n<<<5 5 8 1\n6 5 0 1\n6 0 2 4\n9 8 5 5>>>"
