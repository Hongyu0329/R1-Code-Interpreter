    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- The input and output grids are mostly identical except for some specific changes.\n- The changes occur in the middle rows where some '3's are replaced by '2's in the output grid.\n- The pattern seems to be that if a '2' appears in a row, it is surrounded by '3's in the input grid.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- Similar to Example 1, the input and output grids are mostly identical.\n- The changes occur where '4's appear in the output grid, replacing some '3's in the input grid.\n- The '4's appear in a pattern where they are surrounded by '3's in the input grid.\n\n### General Rule:\n- It seems that the transformation involves identifying specific patterns or clusters in the input grid and replacing certain numbers based on their surroundings.\n- Specifically, it appears that certain numbers (like '2' or '4') are introduced in the output grid based on the presence of clusters of '3's in the input grid.\n\n### Test Input Prediction:\nGiven the test input, we need to apply a similar transformation rule. We will look for clusters of '3's and replace them with '4's in the output grid, similar to the patterns observed in the examples.\n\nLet's write the Python code to apply this transformation rule to the test input grid:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    output_grid = [row[:] for row in input_grid]  # Copy the input grid to the output grid\n\n    # Iterate over the grid to apply the transformation rule\n    for i in range(1, len(input_grid) - 1):\n        for j in range(1, len(input_grid[i]) - 1):\n            # Check for a pattern of '3's surrounded by '3's\n            if input_grid[i][j] == 3 and input_grid[i-1][j] == 3 and input_grid[i+1][j] == 3:\n                if input_grid[i][j-1] == 3 and input_grid[i][j+1] == 3:\n                    output_grid[i][j] = 4  # Replace with '4' in the output grid\n\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = [\n    [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n    [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n    [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7],\n    [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n    [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n    [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n    [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n    [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n    [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7],\n    [3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 7, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n    [3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 7, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n    [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 4, 4, 3, 7, 3, 4, 4, 3, 3],\n    [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 4, 3, 4, 7, 4, 3, 4, 3, 3],\n    [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 4, 3, 7, 3, 4, 3, 3, 3],\n    [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7],\n    [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 4, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n    [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 4, 3, 4, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n    [3, 3, 1, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 4, 4, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n    [3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n    [3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n    [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7],\n    [3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 7, 3, 1, 3, 3, ",
