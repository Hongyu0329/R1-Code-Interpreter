    "To solve this problem, let's take a more analytical approach to identify the pattern governing the movement of '8's. We need to consider the spatial relationships between '8's and '2's and any other elements in the grid. Let's break down the problem and try to identify a consistent rule:\n\n### Observations:\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - The '8' at (1, 6) moves to (4, 5).\n   - The '8' at (2, 2) moves to (4, 6).\n   - The '8' at (6, 9) moves to (6, 7).\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - The '8' at (0, 3) moves to (2, 5).\n   - The '8' at (1, 9) moves to (2, 8).\n   - The '8' at (4, 1) moves to (4, 5).\n   - The '8' at (8, 6) moves to (5, 6).\n\n### Pattern Recognition:\n- The '8's are moved to positions that are often near the center of the grid or near other '8's.\n- The movement seems to be influenced by the presence of '2's, as '8's are not placed on top of '2's.\n- The '8's are often moved to a position that is two rows down or two columns to the right, but not strictly following a simple diagonal or linear pattern.\n\n### Refined Plan:\n- For each '8', attempt to move it to a new position based on a more complex rule that considers its relative position to other '8's and '2's.\n- Use a priority system to determine the best new position for each '8'.\n\nLet's implement a more sophisticated pattern recognition approach:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Create an empty grid for the output\n    output_grid = [[0] * 10 for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # Copy '2's to the output grid\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if input_grid[i][j] == 2:\n                output_grid[i][j] = 2\n    \n    # Move '8's based on a more complex pattern\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if input_grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Attempt to move '8' to a new position\n                # Prioritize moving to a position that is two rows down or two columns to the right\n                new_positions = [\n                    (i + 3, j - 1),  # Move down and left\n                    (i + 2, j + 1),  # Move down and right\n                    (i + 1, j + 2),  # Move right and down\n                    (i + 2, j - 2)   # Move down and left\n                ]\n                \n                for new_i, new_j in new_positions:\n                    if 0 <= new_i < 10 and 0 <= new_j < 10 and output_grid[new_i][new_j] == 0:\n                        output_grid[new_i][new_j] = 8\n                        break\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [8, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Get the output grid\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output grid\nfor row in output_grid:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nThis code attempts to move '8's based on a prioritized list of potential new positions, considering both downwards and rightwards movements, as well as diagonal options. This approach aims to better capture the complex interactions observed in the examples. Adjustments may still be needed based on further analysis of the pattern."

    "The current solution involves a systematic search approach with loops and direct mathematical operations, which is a good start. However, the rule for moving '8's is not fully capturing the transformation seen in the examples. Consider refining the rule to better match the observed pattern in the examples. Specifically, analyze the movement of '8's more closely to ensure they are placed correctly in the output grid. Additionally, ensure that the code accounts for all possible scenarios of '8' placement, including edge cases. Try to enhance the logic to handle these cases more effectively.",
    "The current solution attempts to refine the movement pattern of '8's, but the output still does not match the expected results.
