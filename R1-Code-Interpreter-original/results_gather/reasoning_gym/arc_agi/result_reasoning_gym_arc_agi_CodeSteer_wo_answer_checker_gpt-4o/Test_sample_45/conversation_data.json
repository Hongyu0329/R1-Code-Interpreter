    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input:\n     ```\n     0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n     0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n     0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n     0 0 8 6 6 0 0\n     0 0 8 6 6 0 0\n     0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n     ```\n   - Output:\n     ```\n     8 6 6\n     8 6 6\n     ```\n   - Observation: The output grid is a subgrid of the input grid, specifically the non-zero part.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input:\n     ```\n     0 0 0 0 0\n     0 0 0 0 0\n     0 0 0 0 0\n     0 2 5 0 0\n     0 0 2 2 0\n     0 0 2 2 0\n     0 0 0 0 0\n     ```\n   - Output:\n     ```\n     2 5 3\n     3 2 2\n     3 2 2\n     ```\n   - Observation: The output grid is a subgrid of the input grid, capturing the non-zero elements and their surrounding context.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input:\n     ```\n     0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n     0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n     0 0 0 0 2 2 0\n     0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n     0 0 0 0 5 5 0\n     0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n     0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n     ```\n   - Output:\n     ```\n     2 2\n     3 3\n     5 5\n     ```\n   - Observation: The output grid is a subgrid of the input grid, capturing the non-zero elements.\n\n**Rule Identified:**\nThe output grid is formed by extracting the smallest subgrid from the input grid that contains all the non-zero elements. This subgrid includes all rows and columns that have at least one non-zero element.\n\n**Applying the Rule to the Test Input:**\n\nTest Input:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 5 2 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\n- The non-zero elements are in the 3rd and 4th rows and the 3rd and 4th columns.\n- Extract the subgrid from the 3rd to 4th rows and 3rd to 4th columns.\n\nOutput Grid:\n```\n5 2\n2 0\n```\n\nFinal Answer:\n<<<5 2\n2 0>>>",
    "To implement a systematic approach to extract the subgrid containing all non-zero elements, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Bounds:**\n   - Iterate over the grid to find the minimum and maximum row and column indices that contain non-zero elements. This will help us determine the bounds of the subgrid.\n\n2. **Extract the Subgrid:**\n   - Using the identified bounds, extract the subgrid from the input grid.\n\n3. **Output the Subgrid:**\n   - Print the extracted subgrid.\n\nHere's the Python code to achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef extract_subgrid(grid):\n    min_row, max_row = len(grid), -1\n    min_col, max_col = len(grid[0]), -1\n\n    # Find the bounds of the non-zero elements\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        for j in range(len(grid[i])):\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                if i < min_row:\n                    min_row = i\n                if i > max_row:\n                    max_row = i\n                if j < min_col:\n                    min_col = j\n                if j > max_col:\n                    max_col = j\n\n    # Extract the subgrid\n    subgrid = []\n    for i in range(min_row, max_row + 1):\n        subgrid.append(grid[i][min_col:max_col + 1])\n\n    return subgrid\n\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 5, 2, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Extract and print the subgrid\noutput_grid = extract_subgrid(input_grid)\nfor row in output_grid:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nThis code will output the subgrid containing all non-zero elements from the input grid, ensuring that the solution is robust and scalable for more complex scenarios."

    "The TaskLLM's current approach of identifying the subgrid containing all non-zero elements is correct. However, to ensure robustness and handle more complex cases, consider implementing a more systematic approach using code. This could involve iterating over the grid to find the bounds of the non-zero elements and then extracting the subgrid programmatically. This approach will be more scalable and less prone to errors in more complex scenarios. Try to solve this question with more complex and delicate code, utilizing efficient searching techniques to identify the subgrid."
