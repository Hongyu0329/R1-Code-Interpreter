    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid. Let's analyze the examples provided:\n\n1.

The number '9' in the input grid seems to act as a separator or boundary, as it forms a complete row in the middle of the grid.\n4.

The output grid values are either '4' or '6', suggesting a transformation rule based on the presence of certain numbers.\n\n### Hypothesis:\n- Each cell in the output grid corresponds to a specific section of the input grid.\n- The presence of '1's in these sections influences whether the output is '4' or '6'.\n\n### Plan:\n1. Divide the input grid into nine 3x3 sections.\n2. For each section, check if there is at least one '1'.\n3. If a '1' is present, set the corresponding output cell to '4'; otherwise, set it to '6'.\n\nLet's implement this refined plan:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Define the regions in the input grid that correspond to each cell in the output grid\n    regions = [\n        [(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)],  # Top-left\n        [(0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6)],  # Top-middle\n        [(0, 8), (0, 9), (0, 10), (1, 8), (1, 9), (1, 10), (2, 8), (2, 9), (2, 10)],  # Top-right\n        [(4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 2)],  # Middle-left\n        [(4, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6)],  # Center\n        [(4, 8), (4, 9), (4, 10), (5, 8), (5, 9), (5, 10), (6, 8), (6, 9), (6, 10)],  # Middle-right\n        [(8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2), (9, 0), (9, 1), (9, 2), (10, 0), (10, 1), (10, 2)],  # Bottom-left\n        [(8, 4), (8, 5), (8, 6), (9, 4), (9, 5), (9, 6), (10, 4), (10, 5), (10, 6)],  # Bottom-middle\n        [(8, 8), (8, 9), (8, 10), (9, 8), (9, 9), (9, 10), (10, 8), (10, 9), (10, 10)]  # Bottom-right\n    ]\n    \n    # Initialize the output grid\n    output_grid = []\n    \n    # Process each region\n    for region in regions:\n        # Check if there is at least one '1' in the region\n        has_one = any(input_grid[r][c] == 1 for (r, c) in region)\n        \n        # Determine the output value for this region\n        output_value = 4 if has_one else 6\n        output_grid.append(output_value)\n    \n    # Reshape the output grid into a 3x3 matrix\n    output_grid = [output_grid[i:i+3] for i in range(0, 9, 3)]\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = [\n    [6, 6, 6, 9, 6, 6, 6, 9, 6, 1, 6],\n    [6, 1, 6, 9, 6, 6, 6, 9, 6, 6, 6],\n    [6, 6, 6, 9, 6, 1, 6, 9, 1, 6, 6],\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [6, 6, 6, 9, 6, 6, 1, 9, 6, 6, 6],\n    [6, 6, 6, 9, 6, 1, 6, 9, 6, 6, 1],\n    [6, 1, 6, 9, 6, 6, 6, 9, 6, 6, 6],\n    [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9],\n    [1, 6, 6, 9, 6, 6, 6, 9, 6, 6, 6],\n    [6, 6, 6, 9, 1, 6, 6, 9, 6, 1, 6],\n    [1, 6, 6, 9, 6, 6, 1, 9, 6, 6, 6]\n]\n\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(\"<<<\", output_grid, \">>>\")\n```\n\nThe output grid should be:\n\n```\n<<<\n[[6, 6, 4],\n [6, 4, 6],\n [4, 6, 6]]\n>>>\n```\n\nIf this approach still doesn't yield the correct output, we may need to further refine the regions or the transformation logic.

    "The current approach of extracting a 3x3 sub-grid and replacing '1's with '4's is not correctly identifying the pattern, as evidenced by the incorrect output. Consider analyzing the input and output grids more deeply to identify a more complex pattern or rule.

You might need to consider different sections of the input grid or a different transformation rule. Try to incorporate symbolic computing or efficient searching techniques to better capture the transformation logic.",
    "The current approach of dividing the input grid into regions and counting '1's is a step in the right direction, but the output is not as expected. Consider refining the regions or the transformation rule. Analyze the examples again to ensure the regions align with the output grid's logic.

Additionally, verify if the transformation rule (presence of '1's leading to '4') is consistently applied across all examples.
