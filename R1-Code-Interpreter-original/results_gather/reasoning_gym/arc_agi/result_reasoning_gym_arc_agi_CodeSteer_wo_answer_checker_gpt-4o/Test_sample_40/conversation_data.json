    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples to find a pattern:\n\n1. **Example 1 Analysis:**\n   - The numbers `3` and `1` appear in the output grid but not in the input grid.\n   - The number `3` appears adjacent to a `4` in the input grid.\n   - The number `1` appears adjacent to a `4` in the input grid.\n\n2. **Example 2 Analysis:**\n   - Similar to Example 1, `3` and `1` appear in the output grid.\n   - `3` appears adjacent to a `4` in the input grid.\n   - `1` appears adjacent to a `4` in the input grid.\n\n3. **Example 3 Analysis:**\n   - Again, `3` and `1` appear in the output grid.\n   - `3` appears adjacent to a `4` in the input grid.\n   - `1` appears adjacent to a `4` in the input grid.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems that the rule is to place a `3` or `1` in the output grid where there is a `0` in the input grid, adjacent to a `4`. The choice between `3` and `1` might depend on the specific configuration or position, but the examples suggest that `3` is more common.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid to modify\n    output_grid = [row[:] for row in input_grid]\n    rows = len(input_grid)\n    cols = len(input_grid[0])\n\n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            if input_grid[i][j] == 0:\n                # Check adjacent cells for a '4'\n                adjacent_to_four = False\n                if i > 0 and input_grid[i-1][j] == 4:\n                    adjacent_to_four = True\n                if i < rows - 1 and input_grid[i+1][j] == 4:\n                    adjacent_to_four = True\n                if j > 0 and input_grid[i][j-1] == 4:\n                    adjacent_to_four = True\n                if j < cols - 1 and input_grid[i][j+1] == 4:\n                    adjacent_to_four = True\n\n                # If adjacent to a '4', place a '3' in the output grid\n                if adjacent_to_four:\n                    output_grid[i][j] = 3\n\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 4, 4, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 6, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 6, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output grid\nfor row in output_grid:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nThe output grid will be printed as a result of executing this code.",
    "To enhance the approach, we can consider the spatial configuration of numbers and their interactions more deeply. One way to do this is by using a graph-based method where each cell in the grid is a node, and edges exist between adjacent nodes. We can then analyze the patterns formed by specific numbers, such as `4`, and how they influence the placement of other numbers like `3` and `1`.\n\nHere's a refined plan:\n\n1. **Graph Representation:** Treat the grid as a graph where each cell is a node connected to its adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).\n\n2. **Pattern Recognition:** Identify clusters or patterns of `4`s and determine how they influence the placement of `3`s and `1`s. This involves checking not just direct adjacency but also configurations like corners or edges.\n\n3. **Advanced Pattern Matching:** Use pattern matching to identify specific configurations that lead to the placement of `3` or `1`. This could involve checking for specific shapes or arrangements of numbers.\n\n4. **Rule Application:** Apply the identified patterns to transform the input grid into the output grid.\n\nLet's implement this refined approach in Python:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid to modify\n    output_grid = [row[:] for row in input_grid]\n    rows = len(input_grid)\n    cols = len(input_grid[0])\n\n    # Directions for adjacency (up, down, left, right)\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n\n    # Function to check if a position is within the grid\n    def in_bounds(x, y):\n        return 0 <= x < rows and 0 <= y < cols\n\n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            if input_grid[i][j] == 0:\n                # Check for specific patterns around the cell\n                adjacent_fours = 0\n                for dx, dy in directions:\n                    ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy\n                    if in_bounds(ni, nj) and input_grid[ni][nj] == 4:\n                        adjacent_fours += 1\n\n                # Apply pattern-based rules\n                if adjacent_fours >= 2:\n                    # If there are two or more adjacent '4's, place a '3'\n                    output_grid[i][j] = 3\n                elif adjacent_fours == 1:\n                    # If there is exactly one adjacent '4', place a '1'\n                    output_grid[i][j] = 1\n\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 4, 4, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 6, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 6, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output grid\nfor row in output_grid:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nThis code attempts to capture more complex interactions by considering the number of adjacent `4`s and applying different rules based on the count.

    "The current approach uses a basic search and numerical operations to identify the transformation rule. However, the rule application seems overly simplistic and may not fully capture the complexity of the transformation observed in the examples. Consider enhancing the code by incorporating more sophisticated pattern recognition techniques or symbolic computing to better understand the relationship between the input and output grids. This could involve analyzing the spatial configuration of numbers and their interactions more deeply, potentially using graph-based methods or advanced pattern matching algorithms. Aim to develop a more nuanced rule that can accurately predict the output grid."
