You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 9 9 9\n8 9 8 8 8 9 8\n9 9 9 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 9 8 8\n8 9 8 9 9 9 8\n9 9 9 8 8 8 8\nOutput:\n8 8 1 3 8 3\n8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 3\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n8 8 9 9 9\n8 8 8 9 8\n8 8 8 8 8\n9 9 9 8 8\n8 9 8 9 8\n8 8 9 9 9\nOutput:\n8 8 1 8 8 3\n8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 1 8 8 8\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n9 9 9 8 8 9 8\n8 9 8 8 9 9 9\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n9 9 9 8 8 8 8\n8 9 8 8 9 8 8\n8 8 8 9 9 9 8\nOutput:\n8 8 1 8 8 3\n8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 1 8 8 3\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 9 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 9 9 9 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 9 9 9 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 9 8 8 8 8 8 9 9 9\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 9 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 9 9 9 8 8 8 8 8\n8 9 8 8 8 8 8 8 9 8 8 8 9 8 8\n9 9 9 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 9 9 9 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 9 9 9 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 9 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\nOutput:\n1 8 1 3 8 3\n8 8 8 8 8 8\n1 8 1 8 8 3\n\nExample 5:\n\nInput:\n8 9 9 9\n8 8 9 8\n8 8 8 8\n8 8 9 8\n8 9 9 9\nOutput:\n8 8 1 8 8 3\n8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8\n\nExample 6:\n\nInput:\n8 8 8 8 8 9 8\n8 9 8 8 9 9 9\n9 9 9 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 9 8 8\n8 8 8 9 9 9 8\n9 9 9 8 8 8 8\n8 9 8 8 8 9 8\n8 8 8 8 9 9 9\nOutput:\n8 8 1 3 8 3\n8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 3 8 3\n\nExample 7:\n\nInput:\n8 8 8 9 9 9 8\n8 8 8 8 9 8 8\n8 9 8 8 8 8 8\n9 9 9 8 9 9 9\n8 8 8 8 8 9 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 9 9 9 8 8\n8 8 8 9 8 8 8\nOutput:\n1 8 1 8 8 3\n8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 1 8 8 8\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid. Predict the corresponding output grid by applying the rule you found.\nYour final answer should be the output grid enclosed in triple angle brackets, like this: <<<output grid>>>\n\nInput:\n9 9 9 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 9 8 8 8 8 8 9 8\n8 8 8 9 8 8 9 9 9\n8 8 9 9 9 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 9 8 8 8\n9 9 9 8 9 9 9 8 8\n8 9 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 9 9 9\n8 8 9 9 9 8 8 9 8\n8 8 8 9 8 8 8 8 8\n",
    "The current solution seems to be manually determining the output grid based on the input grid, which is not a scalable or efficient approach. To improve the solution, consider implementing a more systematic and automated method to identify patterns and transformations. Focus on developing a rule-based or algorithmic approach that can dynamically analyze the input grid and generate the output grid without manual intervention. This could involve pattern recognition, sequence detection, or other symbolic computing techniques to derive the transformation rules.",
    "The current approach attempts to automate the transformation by detecting sequences of 9s and 8s in the input grid. However, the output is not matching the expected results, indicating that the rule derivation might be incorrect or incomplete. To improve the solution, consider the following:\n\n1. Re-evaluate the pattern recognition logic for the first row. Ensure that the conditions for replacing sequences of numbers are correctly implemented and cover all possible cases observed in the examples.\n\n2. Investigate the conditions under which 1s and 3s appear in the second and third rows. It might be necessary to analyze the input grid more deeply to identify these conditions.\n\n3. Consider using more advanced pattern recognition techniques or symbolic computing to derive the transformation rules more accurately.\n\n4. Test the refined logic with all provided examples to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\nBy addressing these points, you can develop a more robust and accurate solution.",
    "The current solution is not producing the correct output, indicating that the rule derivation is still incomplete or incorrect. To improve the solution, consider the following:\n\n1. **Re-evaluate the Pattern Recognition Logic:** The current logic for detecting sequences of 9s and 8s might not be capturing all necessary conditions. Re-examine the examples to identify any overlooked patterns or rules.\n\n2. **Symbolic Computing and Efficient Searching:** Implement more advanced techniques for pattern recognition, such as symbolic computing or efficient searching algorithms, to better capture the transformation rules.\n\n3. **Iterative Testing and Refinement:** Continuously test the refined logic with all provided examples to ensure consistency and correctness. Adjust the rules as needed based on the test results.\n\n4. **Detailed Analysis of Second and Third Rows:** Investigate the conditions under which 1s and 3s appear in the second and third rows. This might require a deeper analysis of the input grid.\n\nBy addressing these points, you can develop a more robust and accurate solution.",
