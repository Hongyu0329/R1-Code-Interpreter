    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - The last column of the input becomes the first column of the output.\n   - The second column of the input becomes the second column of the output.\n   - The third column of the input becomes the third column of the output.\n   - The fourth column of the input becomes the fourth column of the output.\n   - The first column of the input becomes the last column of the output.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - The last column of the input becomes the first column of the output.\n   - The second column of the input becomes the second column of the output.\n   - The third column of the input becomes the third column of the output.\n   - The first column of the input becomes the last column of the output.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - The last column of the input becomes the first column of the output.\n   - The second column of the input becomes the second column of the output.\n   - The third column of the input becomes the third column of the output.\n   - The fourth column of the input becomes the fourth column of the output.\n   - The first column of the input becomes the last column of the output.\n\nFrom these observations, we can deduce that the transformation rule is to rotate the columns of the grid such that the last column becomes the first, and the first column becomes the last, while the middle columns remain in their original order.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Get the number of rows and columns\n    num_rows = len(input_grid)\n    num_cols = len(input_grid[0])\n    \n    # Initialize the output grid with the same dimensions\n    output_grid = [[0] * num_cols for _ in range(num_rows)]\n    \n    # Apply the transformation rule\n    for i in range(num_rows):\n        output_grid[i][0] = input_grid[i][num_cols - 1]  # Last column to first\n        for j in range(1, num_cols - 1):\n            output_grid[i][j] = input_grid[i][j]  # Middle columns remain the same\n        output_grid[i][num_cols - 1] = input_grid[i][0]  # First column to last\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = [\n    [6, 2, 6, 2, 2],\n    [8, 6, 6, 8, 6],\n    [6, 6, 9, 6, 6],\n    [1, 6, 6, 1, 6],\n    [3, 6, 6, 6, 6]\n]\n\n# Get the output grid\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output grid\nfor row in output_grid:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nThe output grid will be:\n\n```\n2 2 6 2 6\n6 6 6 8 8\n6 6 9 6 6\n6 6 6 1 1\n6 6 6 6 3\n```\n\nTherefore, the final output grid is:\n\n<<<\n2 2 6 2 6\n6 6 6 8 8\n6 6 9 6 6\n6 6 6 1 1\n6 6 6 6 3\n>>>",

    "The current solution seems to have misunderstood the transformation rule. The rule is not about rotating columns but rather about identifying specific patterns in the input grid and transforming them accordingly. Please re-evaluate the examples to identify the correct transformation rule. Consider the positions of non-6 numbers and how they are shifted in the output grid. Use this insight to generate a more accurate transformation function."
