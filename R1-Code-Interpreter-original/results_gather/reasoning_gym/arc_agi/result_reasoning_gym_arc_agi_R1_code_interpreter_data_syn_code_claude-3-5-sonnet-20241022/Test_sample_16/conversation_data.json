    "Let me analyze the pattern in these examples.\n\n1) First, let's understand the relationship between input and output grids:\n- Input grids are 6x6\n- Output grids are 3x3\n- The number 6 appears frequently in input grids but not all transfer to output\n\n2) Looking at the pattern:\n- The first column of output seems to come from the first elements of odd rows (1,3,5) in input\n- The second column of output seems to come from the third elements of odd rows in input\n- The third column of output seems to come from the fifth elements of odd rows in input\n\nLet me verify this pattern with Python code:\n\n```python\ndef extract_pattern(input_grid):\n    # Convert input string to 6x6 grid\n    rows = input_grid.strip().split('\\n')\n    grid = [[int(x) for x in row.split()] for row in rows]\n    \n    # Create 3x3 output grid by taking elements from odd rows\n    output = []\n    for i in range(0, 6, 2):  # Take odd rows (0, 2, 4)\n        row = [grid[i][0], grid[i][2], grid[i][4]]  # Take 1st, 3rd, 5th elements\n        output.append(row)\n    \n    # Print the result in required format\n    for row in output:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n\n# Test with the new input\ntest_input = \"\"\"9 6 3 6 3 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6\n9 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6\n1 6 0 6 0 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6\"\"\"\n\nextract_pattern(test_input)\n```\n\nThe pattern is clear now:\n1. Take the first, third, and fifth elements from rows 1, 3, and 5 of the input grid\n2. These elements form a 3x3 output grid\n3. All other numbers (including all 6's in even rows) are ignored\n\nBased on this pattern, for the test input:\n- First row: 9, 3, 3 (from first row)\n- Second row: 9, 6, 6 (from third row)\n- Third row: 1, 0, 0 (from fifth row)\n\n<<<\n9 3 3\n9 6 6\n1 0 0\n>>>",
    "Since the code execution matches my analysis and produces the expected output without any errors, I can confidently provide the final answer.\n\nThe rule I identified was correct:\n1. The output grid is formed by taking specific elements from the odd-numbered rows (rows 1, 3, and 5) of the input grid\n2. From each of these rows, we take the 1st, 3rd, and 5th elements to form each row of the output\n3. All other numbers in the input grid (including all numbers in even rows) are ignored\n\nFor the test input:\n```\n9 6 3 6 3 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6\n9 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6\n1 6 0 6 0 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6\n```\n\nThe output grid is:\n\n<<<\n9 3 3\n9 6 6\n1 0 0\n>>>"
