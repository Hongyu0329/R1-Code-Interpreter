    "Let me analyze the pattern and write code to help understand and apply the transformation rule.\n\nThinking process:\n1.

The frame number (6) creates a new outer border\n3. The inner number (4) expands to fill ALL spaces inside the new outer border\n4. EXCEPT where the original frame pattern was - those positions keep the frame number (6)\n5. This creates a \"window\" effect where the original frame is preserved within the expanded inner area\n\nLet me write the correct code:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    n = len(input_grid)\n    output = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    def find_patterns():\n        patterns = []\n        visited = set()\n        \n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if input_grid[i][j] != 0 and (i,j) not in visited:\n                    # Find boundaries\n                    top = bottom = i\n                    left = right = j\n                    \n                    while top > 0 and input_grid[top-1][j] != 0:\n                        top -= 1\n                    while bottom < n-1 and input_grid[bottom+1][j] != 0:\n                        bottom += 1\n                    while left > 0 and input_grid[i][left-1] != 0:\n                        left -= 1\n                    while right < n-1 and input_grid[i][right+1] != 0:\n                        right += 1\n                    \n                    # Store original pattern positions\n                    original_positions = set()\n                    for r in range(top, bottom+1):\n                        for c in range(left, right+1):\n                            original_positions.add((r,c))\n                            visited.add((r,c))\n                    \n                    patterns.append((top, left, bottom, right, original_positions))\n        return patterns\n    \n    def transform_pattern(top, left, bottom, right, original_positions):\n        frame_num = input_grid[top][left]\n        inner_num = None\n        \n        # Find inner number (if exists)\n        for i in range(top+1, bottom):\n            for j in range(left+1, right):\n                if input_grid[i][j] != frame_num:\n                    inner_num = input_grid[i][j]\n                    break\n            if inner_num:\n                break\n                \n        if inner_num is None:\n            inner_num = frame_num\n            \n        # New boundaries\n        new_top = max(0, top-1)\n        new_left = max(0, left-1)\n        new_bottom = min(n-1, bottom+1)\n        new_right = min(n-1, right+1)\n        \n        # Fill expanded pattern\n        for i in range(new_top, new_bottom+1):\n            for j in range(new_left, new_right+1):\n                if i == new_top or i == new_bottom or j == new_left or j == new_right:\n                    # New outer frame\n                    output[i][j] = frame_num\n                elif (i,j) in original_positions and input_grid[i][j] == frame_num:\n                    # Preserve original frame positions\n                    output[i][j] = frame_num\n                else:\n                    # Fill with inner number\n                    output[i][j] = inner_num\n    \n    patterns = find_patterns()\n    for pattern in patterns:\n        transform_pattern(*pattern)\n    \n    return output\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,6,4,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4,4,6,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4,4,6,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n]\n\nresult = transform_grid(test_input)\nfor row in result:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nBased on the correct understanding of the pattern, here's the final answer:\n\n<<<\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 4 4 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 4 4 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 6 4 4 4 4 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 6 4 6 6 4 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 6 4 4 4 4 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n>>>",

The pattern grows outward by ONE unit in each direction\n2. The transformation follows these exact rules:\n   - The outer border is made of the frame number (6)\n   - Everything INSIDE the outer border is filled with the inner number (4)\n   - EXCEPT for the original frame positions, which keep the frame number (6)\n3.
