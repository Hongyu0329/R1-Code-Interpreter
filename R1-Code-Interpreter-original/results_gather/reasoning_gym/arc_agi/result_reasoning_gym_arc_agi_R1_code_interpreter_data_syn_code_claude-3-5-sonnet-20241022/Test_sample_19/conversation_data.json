    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0\n0 8 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 8 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid. Predict the corresponding output grid by applying the rule you found.\nYour final answer should be the output grid enclosed in triple angle brackets, like this: <<<output grid>>>\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n8 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n",
