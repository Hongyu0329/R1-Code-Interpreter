    "Let me analyze the pattern by examining the examples and writing code to help identify the rules.\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n1. Looking at the examples, I notice that the changes involve adding numbers (1 and 3) around patterns of 4's and 6's.\n2. The number 6 seems to be a marker that appears at one end of a sequence of 4's.\n3. The number 1 appears on one side of the 4's sequence, and 3 appears on the other side.\n4.

Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 4 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 4 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 4 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 4 4 4 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 4 4 4 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 6 0 0 0 1 4 1 1 0 0\n0 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 4 4 4 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 4 4 4 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 6 0 0 0 1 4 1 1 0 0\n0 4 4 4 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 4 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 4 4 4 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 1 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 3 0 3 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 3 0 3 0 0\n0 0 4 1 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 0\n0 3 4 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0\n0 0 4 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 4 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.
