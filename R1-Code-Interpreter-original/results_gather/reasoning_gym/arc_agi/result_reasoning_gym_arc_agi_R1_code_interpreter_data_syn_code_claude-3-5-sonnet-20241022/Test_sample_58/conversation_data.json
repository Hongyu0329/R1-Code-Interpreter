    "Let me analyze the pattern and write code to help understand and solve this puzzle.\n\nThinking process:\n1. Looking at the examples, I notice several key patterns:\n   - The 8s in corners are preserved but the grid is compressed\n   - Numbers (1,2,4,7) form blocks that are merged/combined\n   - The output grid is more compact than the input\n   - Similar numbers that are adjacent or connected tend to merge into larger blocks\n   - The output maintains symmetry and alignment of the blocks\n\n2.

    "I notice my initial solution didn't correctly handle all the patterns. Let me revise my thinking:\n\n1. Looking at the test input more carefully:\n- There are 8s in the corners\n- There's a 7-block pattern at the top\n- There's a 4-2 pattern in the middle-top\n- There are large 4x4 blocks of 4s and 2s at the bottom\n\n2.
