The input grid is placed in the top-left corner of the output grid, and the rest of the grid is filled with zeros.\n\n**Common Rule:**\n- The output grid is always a square grid with dimensions that are a multiple of the input grid's dimensions. Specifically, the output grid's dimensions are the input grid's dimensions multiplied by 3.\n- The input grid is placed in the top-left corner of the output grid.\n- The rest of the output grid is filled with zeros.\n\n**Test Input:**\n- Input: \n  ```\n  1 0\n  0 0\n  ```\n\n**Applying the Rule:**\n- The input grid is 2x2.\n- The output grid will be 6x6 (2 * 3 = 6).\n- Place the input grid in the top-left corner of the output grid.\n- Fill the rest of the grid with zeros.\n\n**Output:**\n```\n1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nThus, the final output grid is:\n\n<<<\n1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0"
