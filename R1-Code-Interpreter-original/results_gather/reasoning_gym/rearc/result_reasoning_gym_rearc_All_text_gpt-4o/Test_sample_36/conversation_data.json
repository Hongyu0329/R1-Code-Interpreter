    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze each example step by step:\n\n**Example 1:**\n- Input Grid:\n  ```\n  9 9 9 1 9 8 8 8 8\n  9 1 9 8 8 8 8 8 8\n  9 9 9 8 8 8 8 8 8\n  8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n  8 8 8 8 9 8 8 8 8\n  8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n  ```\n- Output: `1`\n- Observation: The number `1` appears in the grid, and it is the only number that is not repeated in a large block or pattern. It seems to be a unique or standout number.\n\n**Example 2:**\n- Input Grid:\n  ```\n  5 5 5 2 5 5 5 9\n  5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n  5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n  5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n  5 9 5 9 5 5 5 5\n  5 5 5 5 2 2 2 5\n  5 5 5 5 2 9 2 5\n  5 5 5 5 2 2 2 9\n  5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n  ```\n- Output: `9`\n- Observation: The number `9` appears in the grid, and it is the only number that is not part of a larger repeating pattern. It stands out as unique.\n\n**Example 3:**\n- Input Grid:\n  ```\n  6 6 6 6 6 6\n  6 6 6 6 6 6\n  6 6 6 6 6 6\n  6 6 6 6 6 6\n  6 6 6 6 6 6\n  6 5 6 6 6 6\n  6 6 1 1 1 6\n  6 1 1 5 1 1\n  6 6 1 1 1 6\n  ```\n- Output: `5`\n- Observation: The number `5` appears in the grid, and it is the only number that is not part of a larger repeating pattern. It stands out as unique.\n\n**Common Rule:**\nFrom the examples, it appears that the output is the number that stands out as unique or is not part of a larger repeating pattern in the grid. This number is typically surrounded by other numbers or appears in a different context than the majority of the grid.\n\n**Test Input Grid:**\n- Input Grid:\n  ```\n  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0\n  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n  0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n  0 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 7\n  0 7 6 7 0 0 0 0 0\n  0 7 7 7 0 7 0 0 0\n  6 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0\n  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n  ```\n- Analysis: The number `6` appears in the grid, but it is part of a pattern with `0`s. The number `7` appears in a block, but it is not as isolated as `6`. The number `6` appears in a more isolated context compared to `7`.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nBased on the rule, the number that stands out as unique or isolated is `6`.\n\n<<<6>>>"
