    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze each example step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input Grid:**\n  ```\n  2 2 4 2 2 2 4\n  2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n  4 4 2 2 2 2 4\n  ```\n- **Output Grid:**\n  ```\n  4 4 2\n  ```\n- **Observation:** \n  - The output grid is a 1x3 grid.\n  - The first two numbers in the output (4, 4) match the first two numbers of the first row of the input grid.\n  - The last number in the output (2) matches the third number of the first row of the input grid.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input Grid:**\n  ```\n  8 5 8\n  5 5 5\n  5 5 5\n  5 5 8\n  8 5 5\n  ```\n- **Output Grid:**\n  ```\n  5\n  8\n  ```\n- **Observation:**\n  - The output grid is a 2x1 grid.\n  - The first number in the output (5) is the most frequent number in the input grid.\n  - The second number in the output (8) is the second most frequent number in the input grid.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input Grid:**\n  ```\n  0 8 8 8 0\n  8 8 8 0 0\n  8 8 8 0 0\n  8 8 8 8 8\n  0 8 8 0 8\n  8 8 8 8 8\n  8 8 8 8 8\n  ```\n- **Output Grid:**\n  ```\n  8 0\n  0 0\n  0 0\n  ```\n- **Observation:**\n  - The output grid is a 3x2 grid.\n  - The first number in the output (8) is the most frequent number in the input grid.\n  - The remaining numbers (0) are the second most frequent number in the input grid.\n\n### Common Rule:\nFrom the analysis, it seems the output grid is determined by the frequency of numbers in the input grid. The most frequent numbers are selected to form the output grid. The size of the output grid seems to be determined by the number of unique numbers in the input grid and their frequencies.\n\n### Test Input Grid Analysis:\n- **Input Grid:**\n  ```\n  3 3 8\n  3 3 3\n  8 3 8\n  ```\n- **Frequency Analysis:**\n  - Number 3 appears 6 times.\n  - Number 8 appears 3 times.\n- **Output Grid:**\n  - The most frequent number is 3.\n  - The second most frequent number is 8.\n  - Based on the pattern, the output grid should be a 2x1 grid with the most frequent numbers.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe output grid for the test input is:\n```\n3\n8\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n<<<3\n8>>>"
