    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n- **Input:** `4 4 4`\n- **Output:** \n  ```\n  4 4 4 4 4 4\n  4 4 4 4 4 4\n  ```\n\n  Analysis:\n  - The input is a single row with three elements.\n  - The output is a 2x6 grid.\n  - Each element in the input row is repeated twice horizontally, and the entire row is repeated twice vertically.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\n- **Input:**\n  ```\n  0\n  3\n  0\n  ```\n- **Output:**\n  ```\n  0 0\n  3 3\n  0 0\n  0 0\n  3 3\n  0 0\n  ```\n\n  Analysis:\n  - The input is a single column with three elements.\n  - The output is a 6x2 grid.\n  - Each element in the input column is repeated twice vertically, and the entire column is repeated twice horizontally.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\n- **Input:**\n  ```\n  9 9\n  9 1\n  ```\n- **Output:**\n  ```\n  9 9 9 9\n  9 1 1 9\n  9 1 1 9\n  9 9 9 9\n  ```\n\n  Analysis:\n  - The input is a 2x2 grid.\n  - The output is a 4x4 grid.\n  - Each element in the input grid is repeated twice both horizontally and vertically.\n\n**Common Rule:**\n\nFrom the analysis of the examples, the common rule appears to be that each element in the input grid is expanded by repeating it twice both horizontally and vertically. This results in an output grid that is twice the size of the input grid in both dimensions.\n\n**Test Input:**\n\n- **Input:**\n  ```\n  0 0\n  0 0\n  ```\n\nApplying the rule:\n\n- Each `0` in the input grid is repeated twice horizontally and vertically.\n- The input grid is a 2x2 grid, so the output grid will be a 4x4 grid.\n\n**Predicted Output:**\n\n```\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n```\n\nTherefore, the output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n>>>"
