    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:**  \n  6 6 7 6 6  \n  0 6 7 6 6  \n- **Output:**  \n  6 6 7 0 6  \n  0 6 7 6 6  \n\n**Observation:** The third column of the first row in the input (value 7) is moved to the fourth column in the output. The rest of the grid remains unchanged.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:**  \n  0 0 0  \n  0 0 0  \n  0 0 0  \n  6 6 6  \n  9 0 9  \n  0 0 0  \n  0 0 0  \n- **Output:**  \n  9 0 0  \n  0 0 0  \n  9 0 0  \n  6 6 6  \n  9 0 9  \n  0 0 0  \n  0 0 0  \n\n**Observation:** The first column of the input grid is replaced by the first column of the fifth row (9 0 9). The rest of the grid remains unchanged.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:**  \n  0 0 0 3 0 0 0  \n  0 0 0 3 0 0 4  \n  0 0 0 3 0 0 0  \n- **Output:**  \n  0 4 0 3 0 0 0  \n  0 0 0 3 0 0 4  \n  0 0 0 3 0 0 0  \n\n**Observation:** The second column of the first row in the input (value 0) is replaced by the last column of the second row (value 4). The rest of the grid remains unchanged.\n\n### Example 4 Analysis:\n- **Input:**  \n  1 1  \n  7 1  \n  8 8  \n  1 1  \n  1 1  \n- **Output:**  \n  1 1  \n  7 1  \n  8 8  \n  7 1  \n  1 1  \n\n**Observation:** The first column of the fourth row in the input (value 1) is replaced by the first column of the second row (value 7). The rest of the grid remains unchanged.\n\n### Rule Deduction:\nFrom the examples, the rule seems to involve replacing a specific column in the grid with another column from a different row. The specific column and row to be replaced seem to be determined by the presence of a non-zero value in a specific position.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:**  \n  7 7 0 7 7  \n  2 7 0 7 7  \n\n**Observation:** There is a zero in the third column of both rows. Based on the examples, it seems that the column with the zero is replaced by another column from a different row. However, since there is no clear pattern of which row to choose from the examples, let's assume the rule is to replace the column with the zero by the first column of the second row (value 2).\n\n- **Output:**  \n  7 7 2 7 7  \n  2 7 2 7 7  \n\nThus, the predicted output grid is:\n\n<<<\n7 7 2 7 7\n2 7 2 7 7\n>>>"
