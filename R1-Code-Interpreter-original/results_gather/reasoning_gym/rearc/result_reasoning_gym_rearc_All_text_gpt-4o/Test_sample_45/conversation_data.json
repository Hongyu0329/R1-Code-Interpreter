    "To determine the rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n**Example 1:**\n\nInput:\n```\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n2 6 6 2 2\n2 6 2 6 2\n2 2 6 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n```\nOutput: `1`\n\n- The grid is mostly filled with the number `2`, except for a few `6`s in the lower part of the grid.\n- The output is `1`, which is not present in the grid.\n\n**Example 2:**\n\nInput:\n```\n8 8 8 8 6 6 8\n8 8 8 8 6 8 6\n8 8 8 8 8 6 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n```\nOutput: `1`\n\n- The grid is mostly filled with the number `8`, with a few `6`s scattered in the grid.\n- The output is `1`, which is not present in the grid.\n\n**Example 3:**\n\nInput:\n```\n1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1\n1 2 1 1\n2 2 2 1\n1 2 1 1\n1 1 1 1\n```\nOutput: `6`\n\n- The grid is mostly filled with the number `1`, with a few `2`s scattered in the grid.\n- The output is `6`, which is not present in the grid.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- In each example, the output is a number that is not present in the input grid.\n- The output seems to be a constant value, `1`, except in the third example where it is `6`.\n- The rule does not seem to be directly related to the numbers present in the grid, but rather a fixed output based on some other criteria.\n\n**Test Input:**\n\nInput:\n```\n4 3 3\n4 3 3\n3 4 4\n```\n\n- The grid contains numbers `3` and `4`.\n- Based on the previous examples, the output should be a number not present in the grid.\n- Since the output in the first two examples was `1`, and the third example was an exception, we will predict the output to be `1`.\n\nTherefore, the predicted output for the test input is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
