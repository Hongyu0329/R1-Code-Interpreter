    "To find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, let's analyze each example step by step:\n\n**Example 1:**\n- Input grid has a mix of 9s and 7s, with a single 0 in the middle.\n- Output grid retains the 9s but changes the 0 to a 2.\n- The output grid is smaller, focusing on the area around the 0.\n\n**Example 2:**\n- Input grid has a mix of 8s and 0s, with a single 3.\n- Output grid is a smaller section of the input grid, focusing on the area around the 3.\n- The 3 is changed to a 2, and the surrounding 0s are retained.\n\n**Example 3:**\n- Input grid has a mix of 0s, 1s, and 5s.\n- Output grid is entirely filled with 1s.\n- The output grid seems to focus on the area where 1s are present in the input.\n\n**Example 4:**\n- Input grid has a mix of 7s and 3s, with a single 1.\n- Output grid is a smaller section of the input grid, focusing on the area around the 3s.\n- The 3 in the middle is changed to a 2.\n\n**Common Rule:**\n- The output grid is a smaller section of the input grid, focusing on a specific area.\n- The number 3 in the input grid is changed to 2 in the output grid.\n- The output grid seems to focus on the area around the number 3 or the area with the most distinct number.\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n- The input grid is filled with 1s, except for a 7 and a 6.\n- Based on the rule, the output grid should focus on the area around the 7.\n- The 7 should be changed to a 2, and the surrounding numbers should be retained.\n\nApplying the rule to the test input:\n\n```\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 7 1 1 6\n```\n\nThe output grid should focus on the area around the 7, changing it to a 2:\n\n```\n1 1 1\n1 2 1\n1 1 6\n```\n\nTherefore, the predicted output grid is:\n\n<<<\n1 1 1\n1 2 1\n1 1 6\n>>>"
