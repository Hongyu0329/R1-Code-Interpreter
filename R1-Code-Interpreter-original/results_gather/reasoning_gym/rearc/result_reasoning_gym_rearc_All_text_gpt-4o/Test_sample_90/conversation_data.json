    "To find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n**Example 1:**\n- Input: \n  ```\n  8 2 8 7 8 8 8\n  8 8 8 7 8 8 8\n  8 8 8 7 8 8 8\n  ```\n- Output:\n  ```\n  8 2 8 7 8 2 8\n  8 8 8 7 8 8 8\n  8 8 8 7 8 8 8\n  ```\n- Observation: The number '2' in the first row is repeated at the position where the number '7' is found in the same row.\n\n**Example 2:**\n- Input:\n  ```\n  9 1 0 1 1\n  1 1 0 1 1\n  1 1 0 1 1\n  ```\n- Output:\n  ```\n  9 1 0 9 1\n  1 1 0 1 1\n  1 1 0 1 1\n  ```\n- Observation: The number '9' in the first row is repeated at the position where the number '1' is found in the same row.\n\n**Example 3:**\n- Input:\n  ```\n  1 1 7 1 1\n  1 2 7 1 1\n  1 1 7 1 1\n  ```\n- Output:\n  ```\n  1 1 7 1 1\n  1 2 7 1 2\n  1 1 7 1 1\n  ```\n- Observation: The number '2' in the second row is repeated at the position where the number '1' is found in the same row.\n\n**Example 4:**\n- Input:\n  ```\n  4 4 4 8 7 4 4\n  4 4 4 8 4 4 4\n  4 4 4 8 4 4 4\n  ```\n- Output:\n  ```\n  7 4 4 8 7 4 4\n  4 4 4 8 4 4 4\n  4 4 4 8 4 4 4\n  ```\n- Observation: The number '7' in the first row is repeated at the position where the number '8' is found in the same row.\n\n**Common Rule:**\n- In each example, a specific number from the first row is repeated at the position where another specific number is found in the same row. The number to be repeated is the first occurrence of a number that is not the most frequent in the row, and it is repeated at the position of the first occurrence of the most frequent number in the row.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n**Test Input:**\n```\n9 9 8 2 9 9 9\n6 9 9 2 9 9 9\n9 9 9 2 9 9 9\n```\n\n- In the first row, the number '9' is the most frequent. The number '2' is the first occurrence of a number that is not the most frequent. Therefore, '2' should be repeated at the position of the first occurrence of '9'.\n\n**Predicted Output:**\n```\n9 9 8 2 9 2 9\n6 9 9 2 9 9 9\n9 9 9 2 9 9 9\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n9 9 8 2 9 2 9\n6 9 9 2 9 9 9\n9 9 9 2 9 9 9\n>>>"
