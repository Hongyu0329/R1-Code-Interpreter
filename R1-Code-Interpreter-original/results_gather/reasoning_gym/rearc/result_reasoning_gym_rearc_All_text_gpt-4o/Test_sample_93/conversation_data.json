    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: \n     ```\n     6 6 9 2 2\n     0 0 9 0 0\n     6 6 9 0 2\n     6 0 9 0 2\n     0 0 9 2 0\n     ```\n   - Output:\n     ```\n     0 0\n     8 8\n     0 0\n     0 0\n     0 8\n     ```\n   - Observation: The output grid is smaller than the input grid. The number 9 in the input seems to be significant, as it appears in every row of the input grid and corresponds to the presence of 8 in the output grid.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input:\n     ```\n     3 3 0\n     0 0 3\n     0 0 3\n     2 2 2\n     0 5 0\n     0 5 0\n     5 5 0\n     ```\n   - Output:\n     ```\n     0 0 8\n     8 0 0\n     0 0 0\n     ```\n   - Observation: The number 3 in the input grid seems to be significant, as it appears in every row of the input grid and corresponds to the presence of 8 in the output grid.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input:\n     ```\n     0 0 0 0 0 3 3\n     3 0 0 3 0 0 3\n     0 0 3 3 3 0 3\n     3 0 3 0 0 0 3\n     4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n     7 0 7 7 0 0 7\n     7 0 7 0 0 0 7\n     7 0 7 7 7 7 0\n     7 7 0 7 0 7 7\n     ```\n   - Output:\n     ```\n     0 8 0 0 8 0 0\n     0 8 0 0 8 8 0\n     0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n     0 0 0 0 8 0 0\n     ```\n   - Observation: The number 3 in the input grid is significant, as it appears in every row of the input grid and corresponds to the presence of 8 in the output grid.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input:\n     ```\n     0 0 0 3 5 0 0\n     2 0 2 3 5 0 0\n     0 0 2 3 0 0 0\n     2 2 0 3 5 5 5\n     2 0 2 3 0 0 5\n     ```\n   - Output:\n     ```\n     0 8 8\n     0 8 0\n     8 8 0\n     0 0 0\n     0 8 0\n     ```\n   - Observation: The number 3 in the input grid is significant, as it appears in every row of the input grid and corresponds to the presence of 8 in the output grid.\n\n5. **Example 5:**\n   - Input:\n     ```\n     9 9 0 0 9\n     0 0 9 9 9\n     0 0 9 0 0\n     9 0 0 0 9\n     2 2 2 2 2\n     0 0 0 6 6\n     6 0 0 0 6\n     6 0 0 6 0\n     0 0 6 6 6\n     ```\n   - Output:\n     ```\n     0 0 8 0 0\n     0 8 0 0 0\n     0 8 0 0 8\n     0 8 0 0 0\n     ```\n   - Observation: The number 9 in the input grid is significant, as it appears in every row of the input grid and corresponds to the presence of 8 in the output grid.\n\n### Rule Identification\n\nFrom the analysis, it appears that the rule involves identifying a specific number in the input grid that, when present in a row, results in an 8 in the corresponding position in the output grid. The number that triggers this transformation seems to be the largest number that appears in every row of the input grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nGiven the test input:\n```\n0 3 6 0 9\n3 0 6 9 0\n```\n\n- The number 9 appears in the first row, and the number 6 appears in both rows. The largest number that appears in every row is 6.\n- Therefore, the output grid should have 8s in positions corresponding to the presence of 6 in the input grid.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe output grid for the test input is:\n```\n0 8 0 0 0\n8 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n0 8 0 0 0\n8 0 0 0 0\n>>>"
