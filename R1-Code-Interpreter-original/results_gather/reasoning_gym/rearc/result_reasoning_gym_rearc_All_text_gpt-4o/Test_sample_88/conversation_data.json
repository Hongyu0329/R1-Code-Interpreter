    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze each example step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** The grid contains mostly 9s, with a few 7s scattered.\n- **Output:** The grid is mostly unchanged, except the 7s are replaced by 2s and 3s.\n- **Observation:** The 7s in the input grid are replaced by 2s if they are in the second row, and by 3s if they are in the fourth row.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** The grid contains mostly 8s, with a few 5s scattered.\n- **Output:** The grid is mostly unchanged, except the 5s are replaced by 2s and 3s.\n- **Observation:** The 5s in the input grid are replaced by 2s if they are in the third row, and by 3s if they are in the sixth row.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** The grid contains mostly 0s, with a few 8s scattered.\n- **Output:** The grid is mostly unchanged, except the 8s are replaced by 3s.\n- **Observation:** The 8s in the input grid are replaced by 3s regardless of their position.\n\n### Example 4 Analysis:\n- **Input:** The grid contains mostly 8s, with a few 9s scattered.\n- **Output:** The grid is mostly unchanged, except the 9s are replaced by 3s.\n- **Observation:** The 9s in the input grid are replaced by 3s regardless of their position.\n\n### Rule Deduction:\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- Identify the unique numbers in the input grid that are not the most common number (background number).\n- Replace these unique numbers with a specific number based on their row position:\n  - If the unique number is in the second or third row, replace it with 2.\n  - If the unique number is in the fourth or sixth row, replace it with 3.\n  - If the unique number is in any other row, replace it with 3.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** The grid contains mostly 7s, with a few 8s scattered.\n- **Output:** The grid is mostly unchanged, except the 8s are replaced by 2s and 3s.\n- **Observation:** The 8s in the input grid are replaced by 2s if they are in the second row, and by 3s if they are in the first, fifth, or sixth row.\n\n### Predicted Output:\n```\n7 7 7 7 7 7 3 3 7\n7 7 7 2 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 3 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 3 3 7 7 7 7 7\n3 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n3 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n3 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n7 7 7 7 7 7 3 3 7\n7 7 7 2 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 3 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 3 3 7 7 7 7 7\n3 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n3 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n3 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n>>>"
