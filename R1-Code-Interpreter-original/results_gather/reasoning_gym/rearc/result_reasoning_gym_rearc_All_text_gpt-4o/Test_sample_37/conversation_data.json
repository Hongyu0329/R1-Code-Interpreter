    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze each example step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input Grid:**\n  ```\n  9 9\n  8 0\n  ```\n- **Output Grid:**\n  ```\n  9 9 9 9\n  9 9 9 9\n  8 8 0 0\n  8 8 0 0\n  ```\n- **Observation:**\n  - Each element in the input grid is expanded into a 2x2 block in the output grid.\n  - The top-left element (9) becomes a 2x2 block of 9s.\n  - The top-right element (9) becomes a 2x2 block of 9s.\n  - The bottom-left element (8) becomes a 2x2 block of 8s.\n  - The bottom-right element (0) becomes a 2x2 block of 0s.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input Grid:**\n  ```\n  4 9\n  8 6\n  6 4\n  ```\n- **Output Grid:**\n  ```\n  4 4 4 9 9 9\n  4 4 4 9 9 9\n  4 4 4 9 9 9\n  8 8 8 6 6 6\n  8 8 8 6 6 6\n  8 8 8 6 6 6\n  6 6 6 4 4 4\n  6 6 6 4 4 4\n  6 6 6 4 4 4\n  ```\n- **Observation:**\n  - Each element in the input grid is expanded into a 3x3 block in the output grid.\n  - The top-left element (4) becomes a 3x3 block of 4s.\n  - The top-right element (9) becomes a 3x3 block of 9s.\n  - The middle-left element (8) becomes a 3x3 block of 8s.\n  - The middle-right element (6) becomes a 3x3 block of 6s.\n  - The bottom-left element (6) becomes a 3x3 block of 6s.\n  - The bottom-right element (4) becomes a 3x3 block of 4s.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input Grid:**\n  ```\n  0 3\n  0 1\n  ```\n- **Output Grid:**\n  ```\n  0 0 3 3\n  0 0 3 3\n  0 0 1 1\n  0 0 1 1\n  ```\n- **Observation:**\n  - Each element in the input grid is expanded into a 2x2 block in the output grid.\n  - The top-left element (0) becomes a 2x2 block of 0s.\n  - The top-right element (3) becomes a 2x2 block of 3s.\n  - The bottom-left element (0) becomes a 2x2 block of 0s.\n  - The bottom-right element (1) becomes a 2x2 block of 1s.\n\n### Rule Deduction:\nFrom the examples, we can deduce that the rule is to expand each element of the input grid into a square block in the output grid. The size of the block is determined by the number of rows in the input grid. Specifically:\n- If the input grid has 2 rows, each element is expanded into a 2x2 block.\n- If the input grid has 3 rows, each element is expanded into a 3x3 block.\n\n### Test Input Analysis:\n- **Input Grid:**\n  ```\n  6 5\n  6 9\n  ```\n- **Number of Rows:** 2\n- **Output Grid:**\n  - Each element will be expanded into a 2x2 block.\n  - The top-left element (6) becomes a 2x2 block of 6s.\n  - The top-right element (5) becomes a 2x2 block of 5s.\n  - The bottom-left element (6) becomes a 2x2 block of 6s.\n  - The bottom-right element (9) becomes a 2x2 block of 9s.\n\n### Final Output Grid:\n```\n6 6 5 5\n6 6 5 5\n6 6 9 9\n6 6 9 9\n```\n\nTherefore, the predicted output grid is:\n\n<<<\n6 6 5 5\n6 6 5 5\n6 6 9 9\n6 6 9 9\n>>>"
