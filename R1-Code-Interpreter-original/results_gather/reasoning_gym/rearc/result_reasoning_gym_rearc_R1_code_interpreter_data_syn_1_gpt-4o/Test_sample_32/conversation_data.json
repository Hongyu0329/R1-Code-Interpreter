    "To solve this problem, we need to identify a pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze each example to find a common rule.\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input:\n     ```\n     4 4 4 9 4 4 4\n     4 4 4 9 4 4 4\n     4 5 5 9 4 4 4\n     ```\n   - Output:\n     ```\n     4 4 4 9 4 4 4\n     4 4 4 9 5 4 4\n     4 5 5 9 5 4 4\n     ```\n   - Observation: The number '5' is propagated to the right in the second and third rows.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input:\n     ```\n     3 3\n     3 4\n     5 5\n     3 3\n     3 3\n     ```\n   - Output:\n     ```\n     3 3\n     3 4\n     5 5\n     3 3\n     4 3\n     ```\n   - Observation: The number '4' is propagated to the right in the last row.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input:\n     ```\n     9 9\n     9 9\n     3 3\n     9 9\n     9 5\n     ```\n   - Output:\n     ```\n     9 5\n     9 9\n     3 3\n     9 9\n     9 5\n     ```\n   - Observation: The number '5' is propagated to the left in the first row.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input:\n     ```\n     2 2 3 2 2\n     2 2 3 2 1\n     ```\n   - Output:\n     ```\n     2 1 3 2 2\n     2 2 3 2 1\n     ```\n   - Observation: The number '1' is propagated to the left in the first row.\n\n### Rule Deduction\n\nFrom the examples, it seems that the rule involves propagating a specific number to the left or right in a row. The number to be propagated is the one that appears at the end of the row in the input grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- **Test Input:**\n  ```\n  4 1 1 0 1 1 1\n  1 4 1 0 1 1 1\n  1 1 1 0 1 1 1\n  ```\n\n- **Expected Output:**\n  - Propagate the number '1' to the right in the first row.\n  - Propagate the number '1' to the right in the second row.\n  - Propagate the number '1' to the right in the third row.\n\nLet's write a Python script to apply this rule to the test input grid.\n\n```python\ndef apply_rule(input_grid):\n    output_grid = []\n    for row in input_grid:\n        # Find the number to propagate\n        number_to_propagate = row[-1]\n        # Create a new row with the number propagated to the right\n        new_row = row[:-1] + [number_to_propagate]\n        output_grid.append(new_row)\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = [\n    [4, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 4, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n]\n\n# Apply the rule\noutput_grid = apply_rule(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output grid\nfor row in output_grid:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the output grid.",
    "The code executed without errors, but the output grid is the same as the input grid, which indicates that the rule I applied was incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the examples to identify the correct transformation rule.\n\n### Re-evaluation of Examples\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - The number '5' appears in the third row and is propagated to the right in the second and third rows.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - The number '4' appears in the second row and is propagated to the right in the last row.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - The number '5' appears in the last row and is propagated to the left in the first row.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - The number '1' appears in the last column and is propagated to the left in the first row.\n\n### Correct Rule Deduction\n\nThe rule seems to involve propagating a number from a specific position in the grid to adjacent positions, either to the left or right, depending on its position in the grid. The propagation direction and the specific number to propagate are determined by the position of the number in the grid.\n\n### Applying the Correct Rule\n\nLet's apply this corrected rule to the test input grid:\n\n- **Test Input:**\n  ```\n  4 1 1 0 1 1 1\n  1 4 1 0 1 1 1\n  1 1 1 0 1 1 1\n  ```\n\n- **Expected Output:**\n  - Identify the number to propagate and its direction based on the examples.\n\nLet's write a Python script to apply this corrected rule to the test input grid.\n\n```python\ndef apply_correct_rule(input_grid):\n    output_grid = [row[:] for row in input_grid]  # Copy the input grid\n    # Propagate the number from the last column to the left in the first row\n    output_grid[0][-2] = output_grid[0][-1]\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = [\n    [4, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 4, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n]\n\n# Apply the corrected rule\noutput_grid = apply_correct_rule(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output grid\nfor row in output_grid:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the output grid.",
    "The output is still the same as the input, indicating that the rule application is not correct. Let's re-evaluate the examples and the rule application process more carefully.\n\n### Observations from Examples\n\nUpon closer inspection, it seems that the transformation involves propagating a specific number from a certain position in the grid to adjacent positions, but the exact rule is not clear from the previous analysis. Let's try a different approach:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - The number '5' appears in the third row and is propagated to the right in the second and third rows.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - The number '4' appears in the second row and is propagated to the right in the last row.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - The number '5' appears in the last row and is propagated to the left in the first row.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - The number '1' appears in the last column and is propagated to the left in the first row.\n\n### New Hypothesis\n\nThe rule might involve checking for a specific number in the grid and propagating it to adjacent positions based on its location. Let's try to identify the number to propagate and its direction more systematically.\n\n### Applying the New Hypothesis\n\nLet's apply this new hypothesis to the test input grid:\n\n- **Test Input:**\n  ```\n  4 1 1 0 1 1 1\n  1 4 1 0 1 1 1\n  1 1 1 0 1 1 1\n  ```\n\n- **Expected Output:**\n  - Identify the number to propagate and its direction based on the examples.\n\nLet's write a Python script to apply this new hypothesis to the test input grid.\n\n```python\ndef apply_new_hypothesis(input_grid):\n    output_grid = [row[:] for row in input_grid]  # Copy the input grid\n    # Check for a specific number and propagate it\n    for i in range(len(output_grid)):\n        for j in range(len(output_grid[i])):\n            if output_grid[i][j] == 1 and j < len(output_grid[i]) - 1:\n                output_grid[i][j + 1] = 1\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = [\n    [4, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 4, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]\n]\n\n# Apply the new hypothesis\noutput_grid = apply_new_hypothesis(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output grid\nfor row in output_grid:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the output grid.",
    "The output grid shows that the number '1' has been propagated to the right across all rows, which is not consistent with the examples provided. Let's re-evaluate the examples to identify the correct transformation rule.\n\n### Observations from Examples\n\nUpon further analysis, it seems that the transformation involves modifying specific elements in the grid based on their position and the values around them. Let's try to identify a more precise rule:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - The number '5' in the third row is propagated to the right in the second and third rows.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - The number '4' in the second row is propagated to the right in the last row.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - The number '5' in the last row is propagated to the left in the first row.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - The number '1' in the last column is propagated to the left in the first row.\n\n### New Hypothesis\n\nThe rule might involve checking for a specific number in the grid and propagating it to adjacent positions based on its location.
