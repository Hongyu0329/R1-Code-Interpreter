    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** `4 4 4`\n- **Output:** \n  ```\n  4 4 4 4 4 4\n  4 4 4 4 4 4\n  ```\n\nThe input grid is a single row, and the output grid is two rows, each containing the input row repeated twice.\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** \n  ```\n  0\n  3\n  0\n  ```\n- **Output:**\n  ```\n  0 0\n  3 3\n  0 0\n  0 0\n  3 3\n  0 0\n  ```\n\nThe input grid is a single column, and the output grid is two columns, each containing the input column repeated twice.\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:**\n  ```\n  9 9\n  9 1\n  ```\n- **Output:**\n  ```\n  9 9 9 9\n  9 1 1 9\n  9 1 1 9\n  9 9 9 9\n  ```\n\nThe input grid is a 2x2 grid, and the output grid is a 4x4 grid. The pattern suggests that the input grid is surrounded by a border of the first element of the input grid.\n\n### Rule Deduction:\nFrom the examples, it seems that the rule involves expanding the grid by surrounding it with a border of the first element of the input grid. The border is added to both the top and bottom, as well as the left and right sides of the grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule:\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- **Input:**\n  ```\n  0 0\n  0 0\n  ```\n\nWe will surround this grid with a border of `0`s.\n\nLet's write a Python script to apply this rule to the test input grid.\n\n```python\ndef apply_rule(input_grid):\n    # Determine the size of the input grid\n    rows = len(input_grid)\n    cols = len(input_grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    \n    # Create the output grid with an additional border\n    output_grid = []\n    \n    # Add the top border\n    output_grid.append([0] * (cols + 2))\n    \n    # Add the left and right borders to each row of the input grid\n    for row in input_grid:\n        output_grid.append([0] + row + [0])\n    \n    # Add the bottom border\n    output_grid.append([0] * (cols + 2))\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = [\n    [0, 0],\n    [0, 0]\n]\n\n# Apply the rule\noutput_grid = apply_rule(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output grid\nfor row in output_grid:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output grid.",
    "The code executed successfully and produced the expected output grid by applying the deduced rule. The input grid was surrounded by a border of `0`s, resulting in a 4x4 grid.\n\nThe final output grid for the given test input is:\n\n<<<\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n>>>"
