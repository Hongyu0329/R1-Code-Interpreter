    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples to find a pattern:\n\n### Observations:\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - The last column of the input grid is transformed into a column of 1s in the output grid, except where there are non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n   - The rest of the grid remains unchanged.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - The first column of the input grid is transformed into a column of 1s in the output grid, except where there are non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n   - The rest of the grid remains unchanged.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - The last column of the input grid is transformed into a column of 1s in the output grid, except where there are non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n   - The rest of the grid remains unchanged.\n\n### Hypothesis:\nThe rule seems to be that a specific column (either the first or the last) is transformed into 1s, except where there are non-zero numbers in the input grid. The rest of the grid remains unchanged.\n\n### Test Input Analysis:\nThe test input grid is:\n```\n2 7 8 0 0 0 0\n9 0 8 8 0 0 2\n0 0 3 0 0 7 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 4\n2 4 0 0 0 1 0\n3 0 0 6 2 0 0\n6 6 7 0 4 4 0\n```\n\nBased on the examples, it seems that the last column should be transformed into 1s, except where there are non-zero numbers. Let's apply this rule to the test input grid.\n\n### Implementation:\nWe'll write a Python script to apply this transformation rule to the test input grid.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Copy the input grid to the output grid\n    output_grid = [row[:] for row in input_grid]\n    \n    # Get the number of rows and columns\n    num_rows = len(input_grid)\n    num_cols = len(input_grid[0])\n    \n    # Transform the last column\n    for i in range(num_rows):\n        if input_grid[i][num_cols - 1] == 0:\n            output_grid[i][num_cols - 1] = 1\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = [\n    [2, 7, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [9, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 2],\n    [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4],\n    [2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n    [3, 0, 0, 6, 2, 0, 0],\n    [6, 6, 7, 0, 4, 4, 0]\n]\n\n# Transform the grid\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output grid\nfor row in output_grid:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the output grid.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output grid was generated based on the identified transformation rule. The rule applied was to transform the last column of the input grid into 1s, except where there are non-zero numbers. The rest of the grid remains unchanged.\n\nHere is the output grid:\n\n```\n2 7 8 0 0 0 1\n9 0 8 8 0 0 2\n0 0 3 0 0 7 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0 4\n2 4 0 0 0 1 1\n3 0 0 6 2 0 1\n6 6 7 0 4 4 1\n```\n\nThis output grid is consistent with the transformation rule derived from the examples.\n\n<<<2 7 8 0 0 0 1\n9 0 8 8 0 0 2\n0 0 3 0 0 7 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0 4\n2 4 0 0 0 1 1\n3 0 0 6 2 0 1\n6 6 7 0 4 4 1>>>"
