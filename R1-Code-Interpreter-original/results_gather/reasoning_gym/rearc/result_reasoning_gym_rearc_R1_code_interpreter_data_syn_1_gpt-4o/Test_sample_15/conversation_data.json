    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: 2x2 grid\n   - Output: 6x6 grid\n   - The input grid is expanded to a 6x6 grid, with the original values placed in the top-left corner, and the rest filled with zeros.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: 3x3 grid\n   - Output: 21x21 grid\n   - The input grid is expanded to a 21x21 grid, with the original values placed in the top-left corner, and the rest filled with zeros.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: 2x2 grid\n   - Output: 6x6 grid\n   - Similar to Example 1, the input grid is expanded to a 6x6 grid.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: 2x2 grid\n   - Output: 6x6 grid\n   - Similar to Example 1, the input grid is expanded to a 6x6 grid.\n\n5. **Example 5:**\n   - Input: 2x2 grid\n   - Output: 6x6 grid\n   - Similar to Example 1, the input grid is expanded to a 6x6 grid.\n\nFrom these examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- If the input grid is 2x2, the output grid is 6x6.\n- If the input grid is 3x3, the output grid is 21x21.\n- The input grid is placed in the top-left corner of the output grid, and the rest of the grid is filled with zeros.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n**Test Input:**\n```\n1 0\n0 0\n```\n\nSince the input grid is 2x2, the output grid should be 6x6. Let's generate the output grid using this rule.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Determine the size of the input grid\n    input_rows = len(input_grid)\n    input_cols = len(input_grid[0])\n    \n    # Determine the size of the output grid\n    if input_rows == 2 and input_cols == 2:\n        output_size = 6\n    elif input_rows == 3 and input_cols == 3:\n        output_size = 21\n    else:\n        raise ValueError(\"Unexpected input grid size\")\n    \n    # Create the output grid filled with zeros\n    output_grid = [[0] * output_size for _ in range(output_size)]\n    \n    # Place the input grid in the top-left corner of the output grid\n    for i in range(input_rows):\n        for j in range(input_cols):\n            output_grid[i][j] = input_grid[i][j]\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [\n    [1, 0],\n    [0, 0]\n]\n\n# Transform the grid\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output grid\nfor row in output_grid:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output grid.",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors, and the output grid matches the expected transformation based on the rule we deduced. The input grid was correctly expanded to a 6x6 grid with the original values placed in the top-left corner, and the rest filled with zeros.\n\nTherefore, the final output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<\n1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n>>>"
