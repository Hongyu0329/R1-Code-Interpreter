    "To solve this problem, we need to identify a pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:**\n  ```\n  2 2 4 2 2 2 4\n  2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n  4 4 2 2 2 2 4\n  ```\n- **Output:**\n  ```\n  4 4 2\n  ```\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:**\n  ```\n  8 5 8\n  5 5 5\n  5 5 5\n  5 5 8\n  8 5 5\n  ```\n- **Output:**\n  ```\n  5\n  8\n  ```\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:**\n  ```\n  0 8 8 8 0\n  8 8 8 0 0\n  8 8 8 0 0\n  8 8 8 8 8\n  0 8 8 0 8\n  8 8 8 8 8\n  8 8 8 8 8\n  ```\n- **Output:**\n  ```\n  8 0\n  0 0\n  0 0\n  ```\n\n### Observations:\n1. The output grid seems to be a subset of the input grid.\n2. The output grid appears to be a diagonal or a specific section of the input grid.\n3. The output grid might be derived from the most frequent elements or a pattern in the input grid.\n\n### Hypothesis:\nThe output grid is formed by extracting a diagonal or a specific pattern from the input grid. It could be the most frequent elements or a specific section that follows a pattern.\n\n### Test Input:\n- **Input:**\n  ```\n  3 3 8\n  3 3 3\n  8 3 8\n  ```\n\nLet's write a Python script to analyze the input grid and predict the output grid based on the identified pattern.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef find_pattern(input_grid):\n    # Convert input grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    \n    # Get the shape of the grid\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    \n    # Extract the diagonal elements\n    diagonal = np.diagonal(grid)\n    \n    # Count the frequency of each element in the diagonal\n    counter = Counter(diagonal)\n    \n    # Sort elements by frequency and value\n    most_common = sorted(counter.items(), key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))\n    \n    # Create the output grid based on the most common elements\n    output_grid = [x[0] for x in most_common]\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = [\n    [3, 3, 8],\n    [3, 3, 3],\n    [8, 3, 8]\n]\n\n# Find the pattern and print the output grid\noutput_grid = find_pattern(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nThe code will be executed to determine the output grid for the test input.",
    "The code output `[3, 8]` suggests that the function is extracting the most common elements from the diagonal of the input grid. However, this approach might not fully capture the pattern observed in the examples. Let's refine our approach by considering the possibility that the output grid is formed by extracting a specific section or pattern from the input grid.\n\n### Revised Hypothesis:\nThe output grid might be formed by extracting a specific section of the input grid, possibly the first few rows or columns, or a diagonal pattern. Let's try extracting the first few rows or columns and see if it matches the examples.\n\n### Revised Code:\nLet's write a new Python script to extract the first few rows or columns from the input grid and see if it matches the pattern.\n\n```python\ndef extract_pattern(input_grid):\n    # Convert input grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    \n    # Extract the first two rows and first two columns\n    output_grid = grid[:2, :2]\n    \n    return output_grid.tolist()\n\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = [\n    [3, 3, 8],\n    [3, 3, 3],\n    [8, 3, 8]\n]\n\n# Find the pattern and print the output grid\noutput_grid = extract_pattern(input_grid)\nfor row in output_grid:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nThis code will be executed to determine the output grid for the test input.",
    "The error indicates that the `numpy` library, which is referred to as `np`, was not imported in the script. To fix this, we need to import `numpy` at the beginning of the script. Let's correct this and try again.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef extract_pattern(input_grid):\n    # Convert input grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    grid = np.array(input_grid)\n    \n    # Extract the first two rows and first two columns\n    output_grid = grid[:2, :2]\n    \n    return output_grid.tolist()\n\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = [\n    [3, 3, 8],\n    [3, 3, 3],\n    [8, 3, 8]\n]\n\n# Find the pattern and print the output grid\noutput_grid = extract_pattern(input_grid)\nfor row in output_grid:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nThis code will be executed to determine the output grid for the test input.",
