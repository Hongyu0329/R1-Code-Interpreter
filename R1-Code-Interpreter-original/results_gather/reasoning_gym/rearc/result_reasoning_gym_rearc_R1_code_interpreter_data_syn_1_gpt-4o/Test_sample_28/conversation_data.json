    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Observations from Examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - The input grid has a row of 5s and a few 7s.\n   - The output grid is mostly the same as the input, except for one change: a '3' appears in place of a '1' in the row where a '7' is present.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - The input grid has a column of 5s and a few 0s at the bottom.\n   - The output grid is mostly the same as the input, except for one change: a '3' appears in place of a '9' in the row where a '0' is present.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - The input grid has a column of 8s and a few 6s.\n   - The output grid is mostly the same as the input, except for one change: a '3' appears in place of a '0' in the row where a '6' is present.\n\n### Common Rule:\nFrom these observations, it seems that the rule involves:\n- Identifying a specific row or column with a unique number (like 7, 0, or 6).\n- Changing a specific number in that row or column to '3'.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\nLet's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- The input grid has a row of 4s and a few 9s.\n- According to the rule, we should change a specific number in the row where a '9' is present to '3'.\n\nLet's write a Python script to apply this rule to the test input grid.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the row with the unique number (9 in this case)\n    for i, row in enumerate(input_grid):\n        if 9 in row:\n            # Change the first occurrence of 0 in this row to 3\n            for j, value in enumerate(row):\n                if value == 0:\n                    input_grid[i][j] = 3\n                    return input_grid\n    return input_grid\n\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Transform the grid\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output grid\nfor row in output_grid:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the output grid.",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors, and it produced an output grid. Let's analyze the output to ensure it aligns with the rule we identified.\n\n### Analysis of the Output:\n- The input grid had a row with a '9' in it.\n- According to the rule, we should change the first occurrence of '0' in that row to '3'.\n- The output grid reflects this change correctly in the row where '9' is present.\n\nThe output grid is consistent with the rule derived from the examples. Therefore, the final output grid is:\n\n<<<\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n>>>"
