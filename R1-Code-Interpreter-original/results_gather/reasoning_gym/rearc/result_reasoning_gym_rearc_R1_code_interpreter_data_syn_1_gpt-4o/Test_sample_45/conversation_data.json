    "To solve this problem, we need to identify a rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input Grid:**\n  ```\n  2 2 2 2 2\n  2 2 2 2 2\n  2 2 2 2 2\n  2 6 6 2 2\n  2 6 2 6 2\n  2 2 6 2 2\n  2 2 2 2 2\n  ```\n- **Output:** `1`\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input Grid:**\n  ```\n  8 8 8 8 6 6 8\n  8 8 8 8 6 8 6\n  8 8 8 8 8 6 8\n  8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n  ```\n- **Output:** `1`\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input Grid:**\n  ```\n  1 1 1 1\n  1 1 1 1\n  1 2 1 1\n  2 2 2 1\n  1 2 1 1\n  1 1 1 1\n  ```\n- **Output:** `6`\n\n### Observations:\n1. In Example 1 and Example 2, the output is `1`. Both grids have a majority of one number (2 in Example 1 and 8 in Example 2) with a few occurrences of another number (6 in both cases).\n2. In Example 3, the output is `6`, which is the count of the number `2` in the grid.\n\n### Hypothesis:\nThe output seems to be related to the count of a specific number in the grid. In Examples 1 and 2, the number `6` appears a few times, and the output is `1`. In Example 3, the number `2` appears `6` times, and the output is `6`.\n\n### Rule:\nThe output is the count of the number that appears the least in the grid.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n### Test Input:\n```\n4 3 3\n4 3 3\n3 4 4\n```\n\n- Count of `3`: 4 times\n- Count of `4`: 4 times\n\nBoth numbers appear the same number of times, so the rule might need to be adjusted to handle ties. In the given examples, there are no ties, so let's assume the rule is to return the count of the least frequent number, and in case of a tie, return the count of any of the tied numbers.\n\nLet's write a Python script to count the occurrences of each number and determine the output based on the rule.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef find_least_frequent_count(grid):\n    # Flatten the grid and count occurrences of each number\n    flat_grid = [num for row in grid for num in row]\n    counts = Counter(flat_grid)\n    # Find the minimum count\n    min_count = min(counts.values())\n    return min_count\n\n# Test input grid\ntest_input = [\n    [4, 3, 3],\n    [4, 3, 3],\n    [3, 4, 4]\n]\n\n# Find the output for the test input\noutput = find_least_frequent_count(test_input)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the output for the test input grid.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the output `4`. This means that in the test input grid, the least frequent number appears `4` times. \n\nBased on the rule we identified, the output for the test input grid is `4`.\n\nTherefore, the predicted output grid is:\n\n<<<4>>>"
