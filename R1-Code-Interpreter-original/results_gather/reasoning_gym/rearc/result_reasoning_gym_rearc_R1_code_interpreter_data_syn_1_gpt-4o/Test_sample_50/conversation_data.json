    "To solve this problem, we need to identify a pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:**\n  ```\n  8 8 8 8 8\n  8 8 8 8 8\n  8 8 8 8 8\n  8 8 5 8 8\n  ```\n- **Output:**\n  ```\n  8 8 5 8 8\n  8 8 8 8 8\n  8 8 8 8 8\n  8 8 8 8 8\n  ```\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:**\n  ```\n  5 5 5\n  5 5 5\n  9 5 5\n  5 5 5\n  9 9 5\n  5 5 5\n  ```\n- **Output:**\n  ```\n  5 5 5\n  9 9 5\n  5 5 5\n  9 5 5\n  5 5 5\n  5 5 5\n  ```\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:**\n  ```\n  5 5 5 5\n  ```\n- **Output:**\n  ```\n  5 5 5 5\n  ```\n\n### Observations:\n1. The output grid seems to be a rearrangement of the input grid.\n2. The first row of the output grid is the row from the input grid that contains the smallest non-zero number.\n3. The remaining rows are filled with the other rows from the input grid in the order they appear, excluding the row that was moved to the top.\n\n### Hypothesis:\n- Identify the row with the smallest non-zero number and move it to the top of the grid.\n- Keep the rest of the rows in their original order.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n### Test Input:\n```\n1 8 1\n1 1 1\n1 1 1\n```\n\n### Applying the Rule:\n- The row with the smallest non-zero number is the first row: `1 8 1`.\n- The output grid should start with this row, followed by the remaining rows in their original order.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to verify and generate the output grid.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the row with the smallest non-zero number\n    min_row = min(input_grid, key=lambda row: min(filter(lambda x: x != 0, row)))\n    # Create the output grid\n    output_grid = [min_row] + [row for row in input_grid if row != min_row]\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = [\n    [1, 8, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 1]\n]\n\n# Transform the grid\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output grid\nfor row in output_grid:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and produced the expected output. The rule we identified was applied correctly to the test input grid, resulting in the following output grid:\n\n```\n1 8 1\n1 1 1\n1 1 1\n```\n\nThis matches the expected transformation based on the rule we derived from the examples. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n1 8 1\n1 1 1\n1 1 1\n>>>"
