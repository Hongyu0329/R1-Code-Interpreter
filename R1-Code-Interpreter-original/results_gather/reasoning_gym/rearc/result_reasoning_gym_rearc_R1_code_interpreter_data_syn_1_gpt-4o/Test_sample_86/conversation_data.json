    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Observations:\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: \n     ```\n     6 6 6 9 6 3 6\n     6 3 6 9 3 6 6\n     9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n     6 6 6 9 6 3 6\n     6 6 3 9 6 6 6\n     ```\n   - Output:\n     ```\n     6 1\n     6 6\n     ```\n   - The third row of the input grid is all 9s, which seems to be a key row. The output grid seems to be derived from the rows above and below this key row.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input:\n     ```\n     2 6 8 6 6 8 6 6\n     6 6 8 6 2 8 6 6\n     6 6 8 2 6 8 6 2\n     8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n     6 2 8 6 6 8 6 2\n     6 6 8 6 2 8 6 6\n     6 6 8 6 6 8 6 6\n     ```\n   - Output:\n     ```\n     6 1 6\n     6 6 6\n     ```\n   - The fourth row of the input grid is all 8s, which is the key row. The output grid is derived from the rows above and below this key row.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input:\n     ```\n     2 5 9 5 5\n     5 2 9 2 2\n     9 9 9 9 9\n     2 2 9 5 2\n     5 5 9 5 5\n     ```\n   - Output:\n     ```\n     1 1\n     1 5\n     ```\n   - The third row is all 9s, which is the key row. The output grid is derived from the rows above and below this key row.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input:\n     ```\n     2 2 5 7 2\n     2 7 5 2 7\n     5 5 5 5 5\n     7 2 5 2 7\n     2 7 5 2 7\n     ```\n   - Output:\n     ```\n     2 1\n     1 1\n     ```\n   - The third row is all 5s, which is the key row. The output grid is derived from the rows above and below this key row.\n\n### Rule:\nThe rule seems to be:\n- Identify the row in the input grid where all elements are the same (the key row).\n- The output grid is formed by taking the rows immediately above and below this key row, replacing the elements of the key row with 1s.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\nLet's apply this rule to the test input grid.\n\nTest Input:\n```\n8 4 6 8 4\n8 4 6 8 4\n6 6 6 6 6\n8 8 6 4 8\n8 4 6 4 8\n```\n\n- The third row is all 6s, which is the key row.\n- The output grid will be formed by taking the second and fourth rows, replacing the elements of the key row with 1s.\n\nLet's compute the output grid using this rule.\n\n```python\n# Define the input grid\ninput_grid = [\n    [8, 4, 6, 8, 4],\n    [8, 4, 6, 8, 4],\n    [6, 6, 6, 6, 6],\n    [8, 8, 6, 4, 8],\n    [8, 4, 6, 4, 8]\n]\n\n# Identify the key row (all elements are the same)\nkey_row_index = 2  # The third row is the key row\n\n# Construct the output grid\noutput_grid = [\n    [1 if x == input_grid[key_row_index][0] else x for x in input_grid[key_row_index - 1]],\n    [1 if x == input_grid[key_row_index][0] else x for x in input_grid[key_row_index + 1]]\n]\n\n# Print the output grid\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to get the output grid.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the output grid based on the rule we identified. The output grid is derived by taking the rows immediately above and below the key row, replacing the elements of the key row with 1s.\n\nThe output grid for the test input is:\n```\n8 4 1 8 4\n8 8 1 4 8\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n8 4 1 8 4\n8 8 1 4 8\n>>>"
