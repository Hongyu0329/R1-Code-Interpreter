    "To solve this problem, we need to identify a pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: `8 2 8 7 8 8 8`\n   - Output: `8 2 8 7 8 2 8`\n   - Observation: The number `2` appears in the output at the same position as in the input, and it also appears at the second last position of the first row.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: `9 1 0 1 1`\n   - Output: `9 1 0 9 1`\n   - Observation: The number `9` appears in the output at the same position as in the input, and it also appears at the second last position of the first row.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: `1 1 7 1 1`\n   - Output: `1 1 7 1 1`\n   - Observation: No change in the first row, but the number `2` appears at the second last position of the second row.\n\n4. **Example 4:**\n   - Input: `4 4 4 8 7 4 4`\n   - Output: `7 4 4 8 7 4 4`\n   - Observation: The number `7` appears in the output at the same position as in the input, and it also appears at the first position of the first row.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems that the rule involves placing a specific number from the input at a particular position in the output. The number is either repeated or moved to a specific position in the first row. The position seems to be either the first or the second last position of the first row.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- **Test Input:**\n  ```\n  9 9 8 2 9 9 9\n  6 9 9 2 9 9 9\n  9 9 9 2 9 9 9\n  ```\n\n- **Predicted Output:**\n  - The number `2` appears in the input grid, and based on the pattern, it should appear at the second last position of the first row.\n\nLet's write a Python script to apply this rule to the test input grid.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Copy the input grid to the output grid\n    output_grid = [row[:] for row in input_grid]\n    \n    # Apply the rule to the first row\n    if len(input_grid[0]) > 1:\n        output_grid[0][-2] = input_grid[0][3]  # Place the number at the second last position\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = [\n    [9, 9, 8, 2, 9, 9, 9],\n    [6, 9, 9, 2, 9, 9, 9],\n    [9, 9, 9, 2, 9, 9, 9]\n]\n\n# Transform the grid\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output grid\nfor row in output_grid:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the predicted output grid.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output grid was generated based on the identified pattern. The rule applied was to place the number `2` from the input grid at the second last position of the first row in the output grid.\n\nThe predicted output grid for the test input is:\n\n```\n9 9 8 2 9 2 9\n6 9 9 2 9 9 9\n9 9 9 2 9 9 9\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n9 9 8 2 9 2 9\n6 9 9 2 9 9 9\n9 9 9 2 9 9 9\n>>>"
