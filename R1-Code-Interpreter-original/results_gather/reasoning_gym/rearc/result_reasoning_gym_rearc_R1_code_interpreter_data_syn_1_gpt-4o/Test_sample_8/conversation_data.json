    "To solve this problem, we need to identify a rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. Example 1:\n   - Input: \n     ```\n     2 4\n     2 2\n     ```\n   - Output:\n     ```\n     2 4\n     2 2\n     ```\n   - Observation: The output is identical to the input.\n\n2. Example 2:\n   - Input:\n     ```\n     2 2\n     2 1\n     ```\n   - Output:\n     ```\n     2 2\n     2 1\n     ```\n   - Observation: The output is identical to the input.\n\n3. Example 3:\n   - Input:\n     ```\n     8 6\n     8 8\n     ```\n   - Output:\n     ```\n     8 6\n     8 8\n     ```\n   - Observation: The output is identical to the input.\n\n4. Example 4:\n   - Input:\n     ```\n     2 5 5\n     5 5 5\n     5 5 5\n     ```\n   - Output:\n     ```\n     2 5 5\n     5 5 5\n     5 5 5\n     ```\n   - Observation: The output is identical to the input.\n\n5. Example 5:\n   - Input:\n     ```\n     2 4\n     4 4\n     ```\n   - Output:\n     ```\n     2 4\n     4 4\n     ```\n   - Observation: The output is identical to the input.\n\nFrom these observations, it appears that the rule is simply to output the grid exactly as it is given in the input. There is no transformation or modification applied to the input grid.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\nTest Input:\n```\n2 2\n2 5\n```\n\nAccording to the identified rule, the output should be identical to the input. Therefore, the output grid will be:\n\n```\n2 2\n2 5\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n2 2\n2 5\n>>>"
