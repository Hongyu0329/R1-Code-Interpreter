    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: A 2x7 grid filled with the number 6.\n   - Output: A 2x7 grid filled with the number 6.\n   \n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: A 2x6 grid filled with the number 2.\n   - Output: A 2x6 grid filled with the number 2.\n   \n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: A 3x9 grid filled with the number 6.\n   - Output: A 3x9 grid filled with the number 6.\n\nFrom these examples, we can observe that the output grid is identical to the input grid. The rule seems to be that the output grid is a direct copy of the input grid, regardless of its size or the numbers it contains.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- **Test Input:**\n  - A 4x6 grid filled with the number 0.\n\nAccording to the rule, the output grid should be a direct copy of the input grid. Therefore, the output grid will also be a 4x6 grid filled with the number 0.\n\nLet's write the output grid in the required format:\n\n<<<\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6\nOutput:\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\nOutput:\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\nOutput:\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n\n\nBelow is a test input grid.
