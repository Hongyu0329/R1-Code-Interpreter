    "To analyze the given Brainf*ck code, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initialization and Setup:**\n   - `>`: Move to the second cell.\n   - `[-]`: Set the second cell to 0.\n   - `>`: Move to the third cell.\n   - `[-]`: Set the third cell to 0.\n   - `<`: Move back to the second cell.\n   - `>`: Move to the third cell.\n\n2. **First Character:**\n   - `++++++++`: Increment the third cell by 8.\n   - `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply the value in the third cell by 13 and store it in the second cell. This results in the second cell having a value of 104 (8 * 13).\n   - `<-.`: Move to the second cell and output the character 'h' (ASCII 104).\n\n3. **Second Character:**\n   - `------`: Decrement the second cell by 6, resulting in 98.\n   - `.`: Output the character 'b' (ASCII 98).\n\n4. **Third Character:**\n   - `>+++`: Move to the third cell and increment it by 3, resulting in 3.\n   - `[<+++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply the value in the third cell by 7 and store it in the second cell. This results in the second cell having a value of 21 (3 * 7).\n   - `<.`: Move to the second cell and output the character 'u' (ASCII 117).\n\n5. **Fourth Character:**\n   - `>++++`: Move to the third cell and increment it by 4, resulting in 4.\n   - `[<---->-]`: Loop to multiply the value in the third cell by -4 and store it in the second cell. This results in the second cell having a value of 1 (4 * -4).\n   - `<-.`: Move to the second cell and output the character 't' (ASCII 116).\n\n6. **Fifth Character:**\n   - `+++++++`: Increment the second cell by 7, resulting in 8.\n   - `.`: Output the character 'h' (ASCII 104).\n\n7. **Final Output:**\n   - The output of the code is the sequence of characters produced by the above steps.\n\nThe exact output of the code is:\n\n```\nhbut\n```"
