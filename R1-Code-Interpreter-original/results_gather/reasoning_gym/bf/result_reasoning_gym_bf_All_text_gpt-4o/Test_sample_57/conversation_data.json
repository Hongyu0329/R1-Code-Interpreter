    "To analyze the given Brainf*ck code, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initialization and Setup:**\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to cell 1.\n   - `[-]`: Set cell 1 to 0.\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to cell 2.\n   - `[-]`: Set cell 2 to 0.\n   - `<`: Move the pointer back to cell 1.\n\n2. **First Loop:**\n   - `>++++++++++`: Move to cell 2 and set it to 10.\n   - `[<++++++++++>-]`: This loop will run 10 times, incrementing cell 1 by 10 each time, resulting in cell 1 being 100 and cell 2 being 0.\n\n3. **Output Sequence:**\n   - `<++`: Move to cell 0 and increment it by 2.\n   - `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in cell 0, which is 2 (non-printable character).\n   - `-`: Decrement cell 0 by 1, making it 1.\n   - `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in cell 0, which is 1 (non-printable character).\n   - `+++++++++++++++`: Increment cell 0 by 15, making it 16.\n   - `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in cell 0, which is 16 (non-printable character).\n   - `+`: Increment cell 0 by 1, making it 17.\n   - `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in cell 0, which is 17 (non-printable character).\n   - `--`: Decrement cell 0 by 2, making it 15.\n   - `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in cell 0, which is 15 (non-printable character).\n   - `<`: Move to cell 2 (which is 0).\n\nThe code outputs a sequence of non-printable ASCII characters. Since these characters are not visible, the exact output is a series of non-printable characters corresponding to ASCII values 2, 1, 16, 17, and 15.\n\nThe exact output of the code is: non-printable characters with ASCII values 2, 1, 16, 17, 15."
