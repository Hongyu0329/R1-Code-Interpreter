    "To analyze the Brainf*ck program, we need to understand how each command works and how they manipulate the memory tape. Brainf*ck uses a memory tape with cells initialized to zero, and a data pointer that starts at the first cell. The commands are:\n\n- `>`: Move the data pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the data pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n- `[`: Jump forward to the command after the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the command after the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n\nLet's analyze the given program step by step:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the second cell and set it to zero.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the third cell and set it to zero.\n3. `<`: Move back to the second cell.\n4. `>++++++++++`: Move to the third cell and set it to 10.\n5. `[<++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply the value in the third cell by 10 and store it in the second cell. This results in the second cell having a value of 100 and the third cell having a value of 0.\n6. `<.`: Move to the first cell and output its value as a character. The first cell is still 0, so it outputs a null character (not visible).\n7. `++++++++++++++`: Increment the first cell to 14.\n8. `.`: Output the value of the first cell as a character, which is ASCII 14 (not visible).\n9. `---..---.`: Decrement the first cell to 11, output twice (ASCII 11, not visible), decrement to 8, output (ASCII 8, not visible).\n10. `<`: Move to the second cell.\n11. `.`: Output the value of the second cell as a character, which is ASCII 100 ('d').\n\nThe visible output of the program is the character 'd'.\n\nTherefore, the final output of the program is:\n\n<<<d>>>"
