    "To analyze the given Brainf*ck code, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initialization and Setup:**\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to cell 1.\n   - `[-]`: Set cell 1 to 0.\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to cell 2.\n   - `[-]`: Set cell 2 to 0.\n   - `<`: Move the pointer back to cell 1.\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to cell 2.\n\n2. **First Block: `++++++++[<+++++++++++++>-]`:**\n   - `++++++++`: Increment cell 2 by 8.\n   - `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: Loop until cell 2 is 0. In each iteration:\n     - Move to cell 1, increment it by 13, move back to cell 2, and decrement cell 2 by 1.\n   - This loop runs 8 times, so cell 1 becomes 8 * 13 = 104 ('h' in ASCII).\n\n3. **Output First Character: `.`:**\n   - `<`: Move to cell 1.\n   - `.`: Output the character in cell 1 ('h').\n\n4. **Second Block: `---.----.`:**\n   - `---`: Decrement cell 1 by 3 (104 - 3 = 101, 'e' in ASCII).\n   - `.`: Output the character in cell 1 ('e').\n   - `----`: Decrement cell 1 by 4 (101 - 4 = 97, 'a' in ASCII).\n   - `.`: Output the character in cell 1 ('a').\n\n5. **Third Block: `>+++[<+++++++>-]<.`:**\n   - `>`: Move to cell 2.\n   - `+++`: Increment cell 2 by 3.\n   - `[<+++++++>-]`: Loop until cell 2 is 0. In each iteration:\n     - Move to cell 1, increment it by 7, move back to cell 2, and decrement cell 2 by 1.\n   - This loop runs 3 times, so cell 1 becomes 97 + 3 * 7 = 118 ('v' in ASCII).\n   - `<`: Move to cell 1.\n   - `.`: Output the character in cell 1 ('v').\n\n6. **Fourth Block: `>++++[<---->-]<-.`:**\n   - `>`: Move to cell 2.\n   - `++++`: Increment cell 2 by 4.\n   - `[<---->-]`: Loop until cell 2 is 0. In each iteration:\n     - Move to cell 1, decrement it by 4, move back to cell 2, and decrement cell 2 by 1.\n   - This loop runs 4 times, so cell 1 becomes 118 - 4 * 4 = 102 ('f' in ASCII).\n   - `<`: Move to cell 1.\n   - `-`: Decrement cell 1 by 1 (102 - 1 = 101, 'e' in ASCII).\n   - `.`: Output the character in cell 1 ('e').\n\n7. **Final Block: `<`:**\n   - `<`: Move to cell 0 (not used further).\n\nThe final output of the Brainf*ck code is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands: \"heave\".\n\n**Answer: heave**"
