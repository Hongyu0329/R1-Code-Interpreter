    "To analyze the Brainf*ck program, we need to understand how each command works:\n\n- `>` moves the pointer to the right.\n- `<` moves the pointer to the left.\n- `+` increments the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-` decrements the byte at the data pointer.\n- `[` jumps past the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]` jumps back to the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n- `.` outputs the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n\nLet's break down the program step by step:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to cell 1 and set it to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to cell 2 and set it to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move back to cell 1.\n4. `+++++++++[<+++++++++++++>-]`: \n   - Set cell 1 to 9.\n   - Loop: Multiply cell 1 by 13 (9 * 13 = 117) and store in cell 0.\n5. `<+.`: \n   - Move to cell 0 and output its value (117), which is 'u'.\n6. `>++++[<---->-]`: \n   - Move to cell 1 and set it to 4.\n   - Loop: Subtract 4 from cell 1 until it is 0, decrementing cell 2 by 4 each time (4 * 4 = 16).\n7. `<-.`: \n   - Move to cell 0 and decrement it by 1 (117 - 1 = 116), then output it, which is 't'.\n8. `+++++++++++++.`: \n   - Increment cell 0 by 13 (116 + 13 = 129), then output it, which is '' (non-printable character).\n9. `+.`: \n   - Increment cell 0 by 1 (129 + 1 = 130), then output it, which is '' (non-printable character).\n10. `--------------.`: \n    - Decrement cell 0 by 14 (130 - 14 = 116), then output it, which is 't'.\n11. `<`: Move to cell 1.\n\nThe output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands. The non-printable characters '' and '' are not typically visible in standard text output.\n\nTherefore, the output of the program is:\n\n<<<utt>>>"
