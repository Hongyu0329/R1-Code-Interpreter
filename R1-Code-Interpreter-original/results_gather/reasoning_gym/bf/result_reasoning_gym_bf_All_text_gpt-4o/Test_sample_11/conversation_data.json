    "To analyze the given Brainf*ck code, we need to understand how each command manipulates the memory tape and the pointer. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Initialization**: \n   - `>`: Move the pointer to cell 1.\n   - `[-]`: Set cell 1 to 0.\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to cell 2.\n   - `[-]`: Set cell 2 to 0.\n   - `<`: Move the pointer back to cell 1.\n\n2. **Set up a loop to initialize cell 0**:\n   - `>++++++++`: Move to cell 1 and add 8 to it.\n   - `[<++++++++++++++>-]`: This loop will run 8 times (since cell 1 is 8), and each time it will:\n     - Move to cell 0 and add 14 (since `++++++++++++++` is 14).\n     - Move back to cell 1 and decrement it by 1.\n   - After the loop, cell 0 will have 8 * 14 = 112, and cell 1 will be 0.\n\n3. **Output the characters**:\n   - `<.`: Move to cell 0 and output its value as a character. 112 corresponds to 'p' in ASCII.\n   - `-----------`: Subtract 11 from cell 0, making it 101.\n   - `.`: Output the character for 101, which is 'e'.\n   - `+++++++++++++`: Add 13 to cell 0, making it 114.\n   - `.`: Output the character for 114, which is 'r'.\n   - `---------------`: Subtract 15 from cell 0, making it 99.\n   - `.`: Output the character for 99, which is 'c'.\n   - `+++++`: Add 5 to cell 0, making it 104.\n   - `.`: Output the character for 104, which is 'h'.\n   - `<`: Move to cell 2 (though this is not necessary for output).\n\nThe final output of the code is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\n**Output**: perch"
