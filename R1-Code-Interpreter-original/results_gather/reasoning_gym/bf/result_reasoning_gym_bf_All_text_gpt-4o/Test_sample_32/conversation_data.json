    "To analyze the Brainf*ck program, we need to understand how each command works:\n\n- `>`: Move the pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n- `[`: Jump past the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n\nLet's break down the program step by step:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the second cell and set it to zero.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the third cell and set it to zero.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the second cell.\n4. `++++++++`: Increment the second cell to 8.\n5. `[<++++++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply the second cell by 14 and store the result in the first cell. This results in the first cell being 112 (8 * 14).\n6. `<`: Move to the first cell.\n7. `.`: Output the character corresponding to 112, which is 'p'.\n8. `----`: Decrement the first cell to 108.\n9. `.`: Output the character corresponding to 108, which is 'l'.\n10. `+++++++++`: Increment the first cell to 117.\n11. `.`: Output the character corresponding to 117, which is 'u'.\n12. `--------`: Decrement the first cell to 109.\n13. `.`: Output the character corresponding to 109, which is 'm'.\n14. `+++`: Increment the first cell to 112.\n15. `.`: Output the character corresponding to 112, which is 'p'.\n16. `<`: Move to the second cell.\n\nThe output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\nTherefore, the final output of the program is:\n\n<<<plump>>>"
