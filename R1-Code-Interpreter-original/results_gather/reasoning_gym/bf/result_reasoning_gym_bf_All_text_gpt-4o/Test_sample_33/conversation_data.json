    "To analyze the given Brainf*ck code, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initialization and Setup:**\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to the second cell.\n   - `[-]`: Set the second cell to 0.\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to the third cell.\n   - `[-]`: Set the third cell to 0.\n   - `<`: Move the pointer back to the second cell.\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to the third cell.\n\n2. **First Loop:**\n   - `++++++++`: Increment the third cell by 8.\n   - `[<++++++++++++++>-]`: This loop will run 8 times (since the third cell is 8), and each time it will:\n     - Move to the second cell (`<`), increment it by 14 (`++++++++++++++`), and move back to the third cell (`>`), decrementing the third cell by 1 (`-`).\n   - After the loop, the second cell will be 8 * 14 = 112, and the third cell will be 0.\n\n3. **Output Characters:**\n   - `<`: Move to the second cell.\n   - `++.`: Increment the second cell by 2 (making it 114) and output the character 'r' (ASCII 114).\n   - `-------------`: Decrement the second cell by 13 (making it 101) and output the character 'e' (ASCII 101).\n   - `+++++++++++++`: Increment the second cell by 13 (making it 114) and output the character 'r' (ASCII 114).\n   - `+++`: Increment the second cell by 3 (making it 117) and output the character 'u' (ASCII 117).\n   - `-------`: Decrement the second cell by 7 (making it 110) and output the character 'n' (ASCII 110).\n   - `.`: Output the character 'n' (ASCII 110).\n   - `<`: Move to the first cell.\n\nThe final output of the code is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\n**Output:**\nrerun"
