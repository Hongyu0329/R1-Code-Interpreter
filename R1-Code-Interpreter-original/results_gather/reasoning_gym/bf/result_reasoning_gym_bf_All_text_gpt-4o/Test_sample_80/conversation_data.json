    "To analyze the given Brainfuck code, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initialization and Setup:**\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to cell 1.\n   - `[-]`: Set cell 1 to 0.\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to cell 2.\n   - `[-]`: Set cell 2 to 0.\n   - `<`: Move the pointer back to cell 1.\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to cell 2.\n\n2. **First Loop:**\n   - `++++++++`: Increment cell 2 by 8.\n   - `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: This loop will run 8 times (since cell 2 is 8). In each iteration:\n     - `<`: Move to cell 1.\n     - `+++++++++++++`: Increment cell 1 by 13.\n     - `>`: Move back to cell 2.\n     - `-`: Decrement cell 2 by 1.\n   - After the loop, cell 1 will be 104 (8 * 13) and cell 2 will be 0.\n\n3. **Output and Further Operations:**\n   - `<`: Move to cell 1.\n   - `-.`: Output the ASCII character for cell 1 (104), which is 'h', and then decrement cell 1 to 103.\n   - `+++++++++++`: Increment cell 1 by 11, making it 114.\n   - `.`: Output the ASCII character for cell 1 (114), which is 'r'.\n   - `-------------`: Decrement cell 1 by 13, making it 101.\n   - `.`: Output the ASCII character for cell 1 (101), which is 'e'.\n   - `.`: Output the ASCII character for cell 1 (101) again, which is 'e'.\n   - `-.`: Decrement cell 1 by 1, making it 100, and output the ASCII character for cell 1 (100), which is 'd'.\n   - `<`: Move to cell 0 (though this doesn't affect the output).\n\nThe final output of the code is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\n**Output:** hreed"
