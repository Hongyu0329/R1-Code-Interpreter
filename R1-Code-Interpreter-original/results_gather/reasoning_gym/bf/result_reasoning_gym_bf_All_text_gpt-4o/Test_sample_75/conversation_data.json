    "To analyze the given Brainfuck code, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initialization and Setup:**\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to cell 1.\n   - `[-]`: Set cell 1 to 0.\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to cell 2.\n   - `[-]`: Set cell 2 to 0.\n   - `<`: Move the pointer back to cell 1.\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to cell 2.\n\n2. **Setting up the loop:**\n   - `++++++++++`: Increment cell 2 by 10.\n   - `[<+++++++++++>-]`: This loop will run 10 times (since cell 2 is 10), and each time it will:\n     - Move to cell 1 (`<`), increment it by 11 (`+++++++++++`), and move back to cell 2 (`>`).\n     - Decrement cell 2 by 1 (`-`).\n   - After the loop, cell 1 will be 110 (10 * 11), and cell 2 will be 0.\n\n3. **Output and further operations:**\n   - `<`: Move to cell 1.\n   - `+`: Increment cell 1 by 1, making it 111.\n   - `.`: Output the character corresponding to ASCII value 111, which is 'o'.\n   - `+++++`: Increment cell 1 by 5, making it 116.\n   - `.`: Output the character corresponding to ASCII value 116, which is 't'.\n   - `.`: Output the character corresponding to ASCII value 116 again, which is 't'.\n   - `---------------`: Decrement cell 1 by 15, making it 101.\n   - `.`: Output the character corresponding to ASCII value 101, which is 'e'.\n   - `+++++++++++++`: Increment cell 1 by 13, making it 114.\n   - `.`: Output the character corresponding to ASCII value 114, which is 'r'.\n   - `<`: Move to cell 0.\n\nThe final output of the code is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\nThe exact output of the code is: `otter`"
