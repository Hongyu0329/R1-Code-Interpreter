    "To analyze the Brainf*ck program, we need to understand how each command works:\n\n- `>`: Move the pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n- `[`: Jump past the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n\nLet's break down the program step by step:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to cell 1 and set it to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to cell 2 and set it to 0.\n3. `<`: Move back to cell 1.\n4. `>+++++++`: Move to cell 2 and set it to 7.\n5. `[<++++++++++++++>-]`: Loop until cell 2 is 0. In each iteration:\n   - Move to cell 1, add 14 (increment by 14).\n   - Move back to cell 2, decrement by 1.\n   - This loop runs 7 times, so cell 1 becomes 98 (7 * 14).\n6. `<.`: Move to cell 1 and output its value as a character, which is 'b' (ASCII 98).\n7. `++++++++++`: Increment cell 1 by 10, making it 108.\n8. `.`: Output the value of cell 1 as a character, which is 'l' (ASCII 108).\n9. `-----------`: Decrement cell 1 by 11, making it 97.\n10. `.`: Output the value of cell 1 as a character, which is 'a' (ASCII 97).\n11. `++`: Increment cell 1 by 2, making it 99.\n12. `.`: Output the value of cell 1 as a character, which is 'c' (ASCII 99).\n13. `++++++++.`: Increment cell 1 by 8, making it 107, and output it as a character, which is 'k' (ASCII 107).\n14. `++++++`: Increment cell 1 by 6, making it 113.\n15. `.`: Output the value of cell 1 as a character, which is 'q' (ASCII 113).\n16. `.<`: Move to cell 0 (though this has no effect on output).\n\nThe output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\nThe final output of the program is:\n\n<<<blackq>>>"
