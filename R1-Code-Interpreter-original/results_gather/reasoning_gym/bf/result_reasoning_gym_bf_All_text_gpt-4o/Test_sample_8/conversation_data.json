    "To analyze the given Brainfuck program, we need to understand how each command manipulates the memory tape and the data pointer. Brainfuck operates on an array of memory cells, each initially set to zero, and a data pointer that starts at the first cell. The commands are:\n\n- `>`: Move the data pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the data pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the memory cell at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the memory cell at the data pointer.\n- `[`: Jump past the matching `]` if the cell at the data pointer is 0.\n- `]`: Jump back to the matching `[` if the cell at the data pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the character at the memory cell at the data pointer.\n\nLet's break down the program step by step:\n\n1. `>`: Move to cell 1.\n2. `[-]`: Set cell 1 to 0 (it is already 0).\n3. `>`: Move to cell 2.\n4. `[-]`: Set cell 2 to 0 (it is already 0).\n5. `<`: Move back to cell 1.\n6. `>`: Move to cell 2.\n7. `++++++++++`: Set cell 2 to 10.\n8. `[`: Start loop (cell 2 is 10, so enter loop).\n9. `<`: Move to cell 1.\n10. `+++++++++++`: Increment cell 1 by 11.\n11. `>`: Move to cell 2.\n12. `-`: Decrement cell 2 by 1.\n13. `]`: End loop (cell 2 is not 0, so repeat).\n    - This loop runs 10 times, so cell 1 becomes 110 (11 * 10).\n14. `<`: Move to cell 1.\n15. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in cell 1 (110, which is 'n').\n16. `+`: Increment cell 1 to 111.\n17. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in cell 1 (111, which is 'o').\n18. `++`: Increment cell 1 to 113.\n19. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in cell 1 (113, which is 'q').\n20. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in cell 1 (113, which is 'q').\n21. `------------`: Decrement cell 1 by 12, making it 101.\n22. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in cell 1 (101, which is 'e').\n23. `<`: Move to cell 0 (not used further).\n\nThe output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\nTherefore, the final output of the program is:\n\n<<<noqqe>>>"
