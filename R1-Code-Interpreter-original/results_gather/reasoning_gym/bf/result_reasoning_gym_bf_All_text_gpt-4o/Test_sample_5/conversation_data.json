    "To analyze the given Brainf*ck program, we need to understand how each command works and how they manipulate the memory tape. Brainf*ck uses a memory tape with cells initialized to zero, and a data pointer that starts at the first cell. The commands are:\n\n- `>`: Move the data pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the data pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n- `[`: Jump forward to the command after the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the command after the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n\nLet's break down the program step by step:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the second cell and set it to zero.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the third cell and set it to zero.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the second cell.\n4. `+++++++`: Increment the second cell to 7.\n5. `[<+++++++++++++++>-]`: This loop will run 7 times (since the second cell is 7), and it will:\n   - Move to the first cell, add 15 (13 + 2), and move back to the second cell.\n   - Decrement the second cell by 1.\n   After the loop, the first cell will be 105 (7 * 15) and the second cell will be 0.\n6. `<.`: Move to the first cell and output its value as a character. The ASCII value 105 corresponds to the character 'i'.\n7. `+++++`: Increment the first cell to 110.\n8. `.`: Output the character 'n' (ASCII 110).\n9. `++.`: Increment to 112 and output 'p'.\n10. `+++++`: Increment to 117.\n11. `.`: Output 'u'.\n12. `-.`: Decrement to 116 and output 't'.\n13. `<`: Move to the second cell (which is 0).\n\nThe program outputs the characters 'i', 'n', 'p', 'u', 't' in sequence.\n\nThe final output of the program is:\n\n<<<input>>>"
