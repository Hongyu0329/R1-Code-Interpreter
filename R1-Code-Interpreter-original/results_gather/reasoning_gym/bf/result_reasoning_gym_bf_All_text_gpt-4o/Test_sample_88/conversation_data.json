    "To analyze the Brainf*ck program, we need to understand how each command works:\n\n- `>`: Move the pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the memory cell at the pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the memory cell at the pointer.\n- `[`: Jump past the matching `]` if the cell at the pointer is 0.\n- `]`: Jump back to the matching `[` if the cell at the pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the character at the memory cell at the pointer.\n\nLet's break down the program step by step:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to cell 1 and set it to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to cell 2 and set it to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move back to cell 1.\n4. `+++++++`: Increment cell 1 to 7.\n5. `[<++++++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply cell 1 by 14 and store in cell 0.\n   - Move to cell 0, add 14, move back to cell 1, decrement cell 1.\n   - Repeat until cell 1 is 0.\n   - Result: cell 0 = 98 (7 * 14).\n6. `<.-`: Move to cell 0, output 'b' (ASCII 98), decrement cell 0 to 97.\n7. `.`: Output 'a' (ASCII 97).\n8. `+++++++++++++`: Increment cell 0 to 110.\n9. `.`: Output 'n' (ASCII 110).\n10. `----`: Decrement cell 0 to 106.\n11. `.`: Output 'j' (ASCII 106).\n12. `+++++`: Increment cell 0 to 111.\n13. `.`: Output 'o' (ASCII 111).\n14. `<`: Move to cell 2 (no effect on output).\n\nThe output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\nThe final output of the program is:\n\n<<<banjo>>>"
