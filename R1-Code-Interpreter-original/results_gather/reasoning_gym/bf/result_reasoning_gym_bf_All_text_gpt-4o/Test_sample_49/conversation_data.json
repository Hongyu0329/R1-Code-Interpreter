    "To analyze the given Brainf*ck code, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initialization and Setup:**\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to the second cell.\n   - `[-]`: Set the second cell to 0.\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to the third cell.\n   - `[-]`: Set the third cell to 0.\n   - `<`: Move the pointer back to the second cell.\n\n2. **First Loop:**\n   - `>+++++++`: Increment the third cell by 7.\n   - `[<++++++++++++++>-]`: This loop will run 7 times (since the third cell is 7), and each time it will:\n     - Move to the second cell and add 14 (increment by 14).\n     - Move back to the third cell and decrement by 1.\n   - After the loop, the second cell will have 98 (7 * 14) and the third cell will be 0.\n\n3. **Output Characters:**\n   - `<.`: Move to the second cell and output its value as a character. The ASCII value 98 corresponds to the character 'b'.\n   - `++++++++++`: Increment the second cell by 10, making it 108.\n   - `.`: Output the character corresponding to ASCII value 108, which is 'l'.\n   - `-----------`: Decrement the second cell by 11, making it 97.\n   - `.`: Output the character corresponding to ASCII value 97, which is 'a'.\n   - `+++`: Increment the second cell by 3, making it 100.\n   - `.`: Output the character corresponding to ASCII value 100, which is 'd'.\n   - `+`: Increment the second cell by 1, making it 101.\n   - `.`: Output the character corresponding to ASCII value 101, which is 'e'.\n   - `<`: Move the pointer to the first cell (though this is not necessary for output).\n\nThe final output of the code is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\n**Output:**\nblade"
