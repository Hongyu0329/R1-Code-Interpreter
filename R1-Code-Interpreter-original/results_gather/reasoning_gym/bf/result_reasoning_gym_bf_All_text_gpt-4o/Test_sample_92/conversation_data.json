    "To analyze the Brainf*ck program, we need to understand how each command works:\n\n- `>`: Move the pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the memory cell at the pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the memory cell at the pointer.\n- `[`: Jump past the matching `]` if the cell at the pointer is 0.\n- `]`: Jump back to the matching `[` if the cell at the pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the character at the memory cell at the pointer.\n\nLet's break down the program step by step:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to cell 1 and set it to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to cell 2 and set it to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move back to cell 1.\n4. `++++++++`: Set cell 1 to 8.\n5. `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: Loop until cell 1 is 0. In each iteration:\n   - Move to cell 0, add 13 (set cell 0 to 104 after 8 iterations).\n   - Move back to cell 1, decrement it.\n6. `<>`: Move to cell 0.\n7. `.`: Output the character at cell 0 (ASCII 104, 'h').\n8. `+.`: Increment cell 0 to 105 and output (ASCII 105, 'i').\n9. `+++++++++++.`: Increment cell 0 to 115 and output (ASCII 115, 's').\n10. `>++++[<---->-]`: Move to cell 1, set it to 4, and loop to decrement cell 0 by 4 each time (cell 0 becomes 99).\n11. `<-.`: Decrement cell 0 to 98 and output (ASCII 98, 'b').\n12. `+++++.<`: Increment cell 0 to 103 and output (ASCII 103, 'g').\n\nThe output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\nThe final output of the program is:\n\n<<<hisbg>>>"
