    "To analyze the given Brainf*ck code, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initialization and Setup:**\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to the second cell.\n   - `[-]`: Set the second cell to 0.\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to the third cell.\n   - `[-]`: Set the third cell to 0.\n   - `<`: Move the pointer back to the second cell.\n\n2. **First Loop:**\n   - `>+++++++++++`: Increment the third cell to 11.\n   - `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: This loop will run 11 times, incrementing the second cell by 13 each time (11 * 13 = 143). The third cell will be decremented to 0 by the end of the loop.\n   - `<`: Move the pointer back to the first cell.\n   - `--`: Decrement the first cell by 2, setting it to -2.\n\n3. **Output Characters:**\n   - `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value of the first cell (-2). In Brainf*ck, negative values wrap around, so -2 corresponds to 254 (ÿ in extended ASCII).\n   - `-----------`: Decrement the first cell by 11, setting it to -13.\n   - `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value of the first cell (-13). This corresponds to 243 (ó in extended ASCII).\n   - `+++++++`: Increment the first cell by 7, setting it to -6.\n   - `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value of the first cell (-6). This corresponds to 250 (ú in extended ASCII).\n   - `+++`: Increment the first cell by 3, setting it to -3.\n   - `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value of the first cell (-3). This corresponds to 253 (ý in extended ASCII).\n   - `----`: Decrement the first cell by 4, setting it to -7.\n   - `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value of the first cell (-7). This corresponds to 249 (ù in extended ASCII).\n   - `<`: Move the pointer back to the second cell.\n\nThe final output of the code is the sequence of characters produced by these ASCII values.\n\n**Output:** ÿóúýù"
