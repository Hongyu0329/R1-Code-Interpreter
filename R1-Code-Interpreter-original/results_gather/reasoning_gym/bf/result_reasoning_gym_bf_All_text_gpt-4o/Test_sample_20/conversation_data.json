    "To analyze the Brainf*ck program, we need to understand how each command works:\n\n- `>`: Move the pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n- `[`: Jump past the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n\nLet's break down the program step by step:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to cell 1 and set it to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to cell 2 and set it to 0.\n3. `<`: Move back to cell 1.\n4. `>++++++++++`: Move to cell 2 and set it to 10.\n5. `[<++++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply cell 1 by 12 and store the result in cell 0. This loop runs 10 times, so cell 0 becomes 120.\n6. `<-.`: Move to cell 0, decrement it to 119, and output it as a character ('w').\n7. `--------`: Decrement cell 0 by 8, making it 111.\n8. `.`: Output cell 0 as a character ('o').\n9. `+++`: Increment cell 0 by 3, making it 114.\n10. `.`: Output cell 0 as a character ('r').\n11. `.`: Output cell 0 as a character ('r').\n12. `+++++++`: Increment cell 0 by 7, making it 121.\n13. `.`: Output cell 0 as a character ('y').\n14. `<`: Move to cell 1.\n\nThe program outputs the characters corresponding to the ASCII values in sequence.\n\nThe final output of the program is:\n\n<<<worry>>>"
