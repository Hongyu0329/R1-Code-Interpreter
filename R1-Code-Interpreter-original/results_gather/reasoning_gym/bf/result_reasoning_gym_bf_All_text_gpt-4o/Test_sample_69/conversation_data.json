    "To analyze the given Brainf*ck code, we need to understand how each command manipulates the memory tape and the pointer. Let's break down the code step by step:\n\n1. `>`: Move the pointer to the right (to cell 1).\n2. `[-]`: Set the current cell (cell 1) to 0.\n3. `>`: Move the pointer to the right (to cell 2).\n4. `[-]`: Set the current cell (cell 2) to 0.\n5. `<`: Move the pointer to the left (to cell 1).\n6. `>`: Move the pointer to the right (to cell 2).\n7. `++++++++++`: Increment the current cell (cell 2) by 10.\n8. `[<+++++++++++>-]`: Loop: Move left (to cell 1), increment by 11, move right (to cell 2), decrement. Repeat until cell 2 is 0. This results in cell 1 having 110 (10 * 11).\n9. `<`: Move the pointer to the left (to cell 1).\n10. `+.`: Increment cell 1 by 1 (making it 111) and output the character 'o' (ASCII 111).\n11. `+++++++.`: Increment cell 1 by 7 (making it 118) and output the character 'v' (ASCII 118).\n12. `>+++[<------->-]`: Move to cell 2, increment by 3, loop: move left (to cell 1), decrement by 7, move right (to cell 2), decrement. Repeat until cell 2 is 0. This results in cell 1 having 97 (118 - 21).\n13. `<.`: Move to cell 1 and output the character 'a' (ASCII 97).\n14. `>++++[<++++>-]`: Move to cell 2, increment by 4, loop: move left (to cell 1), increment by 4, move right (to cell 2), decrement. Repeat until cell 2 is 0. This results in cell 1 having 113 (97 + 16).\n15. `<+.`: Increment cell 1 by 1 (making it 114) and output the character 'r' (ASCII 114).\n16. `+++++++.<`: Increment cell 1 by 7 (making it 121) and output the character 'y' (ASCII 121).\n\nThe final output of the code is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands:\n\n```\novary\n```"
