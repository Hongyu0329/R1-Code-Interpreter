    "To determine the output of the given Brainfuck program, we need to analyze it step by step. Brainfuck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a pointer to manipulate data. The commands are:\n\n- `>`: Move the pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n- `[`: Jump forward to the command after the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the command after the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n\nLet's break down the program:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the second cell and set it to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the third cell and set it to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the second cell.\n4. `++++++++`: Increment the second cell to 8.\n5. `[<++++++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply the second cell by 14 and store the result in the first cell. This results in the first cell being 112 and the second cell being 0.\n6. `<.`: Move to the first cell and output its value as a character. The ASCII value 112 corresponds to 'p'.\n7. `--------`: Decrement the first cell by 8, resulting in 104.\n8. `.`: Output the first cell as a character. The ASCII value 104 corresponds to 'h'.\n9. `-------`: Decrement the first cell by 7, resulting in 97.\n10. `.`: Output the first cell as a character. The ASCII value 97 corresponds to 'a'.\n11. `>+++[<++++++>-]`: Move to the second cell, increment it to 3, and multiply by 6, resulting in 18 in the first cell.\n12. `<.`: Move to the first cell and output its value as a character. The ASCII value 18 is a non-printable control character.\n13. `--------------`: Decrement the first cell by 14, resulting in 4.\n14. `.`: Output the first cell as a character. The ASCII value 4 is also a non-printable control character.\n\nThe program outputs the characters corresponding to the ASCII values 112, 104, 97, 18, and 4. The first three are printable characters ('p', 'h', 'a'), while the last two are non-printable control characters.\n\nTherefore, the output of the program is:\n\n<<<pha>>>"
