    "To analyze the given Brainf*ck code, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initialization and Setup:**\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to the second cell.\n   - `[-]`: Set the value at the second cell to 0.\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to the third cell.\n   - `[-]`: Set the value at the third cell to 0.\n   - `<`: Move the pointer back to the second cell.\n\n2. **First Loop:**\n   - `>+++++++`: Increment the value at the third cell to 7.\n   - `[<+++++++++++++++>-]`: This loop will run 7 times (since the third cell is 7). Each iteration:\n     - `<+++++++++++++++`: Move to the second cell and add 15.\n     - `>`: Move back to the third cell.\n     - `-`: Decrement the third cell by 1.\n   - After the loop, the second cell will have 105 (7 * 15), and the third cell will be 0.\n\n3. **Output:**\n   - `<.`: Move to the second cell and output its value as a character. The ASCII value 105 corresponds to the character 'i'.\n\n4. **Further Operations:**\n   - `-----`: Decrement the second cell by 5, making it 100.\n   - `.`: Output the character corresponding to ASCII value 100, which is 'd'.\n   - `+++++`: Increment the second cell by 5, making it 105 again.\n   - `.`: Output the character corresponding to ASCII value 105, which is 'i'.\n   - `++++++`: Increment the second cell by 6, making it 111.\n   - `.`: Output the character corresponding to ASCII value 111, which is 'o'.\n   - `--`: Decrement the second cell by 2, making it 109.\n   - `.`: Output the character corresponding to ASCII value 109, which is 'm'.\n   - `<`: Move to the first cell (though this has no further effect on output).\n\nThe final output of the code is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\n**Output:** idiom"
