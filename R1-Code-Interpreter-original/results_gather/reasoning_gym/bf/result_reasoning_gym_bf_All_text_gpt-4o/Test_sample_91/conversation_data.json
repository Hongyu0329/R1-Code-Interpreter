    "To analyze the given Brainf*ck code, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initialization and Setup:**\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to cell 1.\n   - `[-]`: Set cell 1 to 0.\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to cell 2.\n   - `[-]`: Set cell 2 to 0.\n   - `<`: Move the pointer back to cell 1.\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to cell 2.\n\n2. **Main Loop:**\n   - `++++++++`: Increment cell 2 by 8.\n   - `[<++++++++++++++>-]`: This loop will run 8 times (since cell 2 is 8), and each time it will:\n     - `<`: Move to cell 1.\n     - `++++++++++++++`: Increment cell 1 by 14.\n     - `>`: Move back to cell 2.\n     - `-`: Decrement cell 2 by 1.\n   - After the loop, cell 1 will be 112 (14 * 8) and cell 2 will be 0.\n\n3. **Output and Final Adjustments:**\n   - `<`: Move to cell 1.\n   - `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in cell 1, which is 112 ('p').\n   - `-`: Decrement cell 1 by 1 (now 111).\n   - `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in cell 1, which is 111 ('o').\n   - `------`: Decrement cell 1 by 6 (now 105).\n   - `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in cell 1, which is 105 ('i').\n   - `+++++`: Increment cell 1 by 5 (now 110).\n   - `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in cell 1, which is 110 ('n').\n   - `++++++`: Increment cell 1 by 6 (now 116).\n   - `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in cell 1, which is 116 ('t').\n   - `<`: Move to cell 0 (though this move is not necessary for output).\n\nThe final output of the code is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\n**Output:** point"
