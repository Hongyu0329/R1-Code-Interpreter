    "To analyze the given Brainf*ck code, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initialization and Setup:**\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to cell 1.\n   - `[-]`: Set cell 1 to 0.\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to cell 2.\n   - `[-]`: Set cell 2 to 0.\n   - `<`: Move the pointer back to cell 1.\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to cell 2.\n\n2. **First Loop:**\n   - `+++++++++`: Increment cell 2 by 9.\n   - `[<+++++++++++>-]`: This loop will run 9 times (since cell 2 is 9), and each time it will:\n     - Move to cell 1, increment it by 11 (total 99 after 9 iterations).\n     - Move back to cell 2 and decrement it by 1.\n   - After the loop, cell 1 contains 99, and cell 2 is 0.\n\n3. **Output First Character:**\n   - `<`: Move to cell 1.\n   - `.`: Output the ASCII character for 99, which is 'c'.\n\n4. **Second Character:**\n   - `+++++`: Increment cell 1 by 5 (total 104).\n   - `.`: Output the ASCII character for 104, which is 'h'.\n\n5. **Third Character:**\n   - `-------`: Decrement cell 1 by 7 (total 97).\n   - `.`: Output the ASCII character for 97, which is 'a'.\n\n6. **Fourth Character:**\n   - `>`: Move to cell 2.\n   - `+++`: Increment cell 2 by 3.\n   - `[<++++++>-]`: This loop will run 3 times, and each time it will:\n     - Move to cell 1, increment it by 6 (total 115 after 3 iterations).\n     - Move back to cell 2 and decrement it by 1.\n   - After the loop, cell 1 contains 115, and cell 2 is 0.\n   - `<`: Move to cell 1.\n   - `.`: Output the ASCII character for 115, which is 's'.\n\n7. **Fifth Character:**\n   - `------`: Decrement cell 1 by 6 (total 109).\n   - `.`: Output the ASCII character for 109, which is 'm'.\n\n8. **Final Move:**\n   - `<`: Move to cell 0 (though this move is not necessary for output).\n\nThe final output of the code is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\n**Output:**\nchasm"
