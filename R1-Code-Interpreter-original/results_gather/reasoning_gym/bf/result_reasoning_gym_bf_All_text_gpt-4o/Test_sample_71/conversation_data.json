    "To analyze the Brainf*ck program, we need to understand how each command works:\n\n- `>`: Move the pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the memory cell at the pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the memory cell at the pointer.\n- `[`: Jump past the matching `]` if the cell at the pointer is 0.\n- `]`: Jump back to the matching `[` if the cell at the pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the character at the memory cell at the pointer.\n\nLet's break down the program step by step:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the second cell and set it to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the third cell and set it to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the second cell.\n4. `+++++++`: Increment the second cell to 7.\n5. `[<++++++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply the second cell by 14 and store the result in the first cell.\n   - Move to the first cell, add 14, move back to the second cell, decrement it.\n   - Repeat until the second cell is 0.\n   - The first cell now contains 98 (7 * 14).\n6. `<.-`: Move to the first cell, output its value (98, which is 'b'), and decrement it to 97.\n7. `.`: Output the value of the first cell (97, which is 'a').\n8. `>++++[<++++>-]`: Move to the second cell, increment it to 4, and multiply by 4 to store 16 in the third cell.\n9. `<+.---.-.<`: Move to the second cell, increment it to 1, output it (1, which is 'A'), decrement it to 0, move to the first cell, decrement it to 96, output it (96, which is '`'), decrement it to 95, output it (95, which is '_'), move back to the second cell.\n\nThe output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\nThe final output of the program is:\n\n<<<baA`_>>>"
