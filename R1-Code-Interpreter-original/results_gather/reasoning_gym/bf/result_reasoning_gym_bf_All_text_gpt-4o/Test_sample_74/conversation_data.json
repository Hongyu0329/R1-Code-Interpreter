    "To analyze the Brainf*ck program, we need to understand how each command works:\n\n- `>`: Move the pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the memory cell at the pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the memory cell at the pointer.\n- `[`: Jump past the matching `]` if the cell at the pointer is 0.\n- `]`: Jump back to the matching `[` if the cell at the pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the character at the memory cell at the pointer.\n\nLet's break down the program step by step:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to cell 1 and set it to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to cell 2 and set it to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move back to cell 1.\n4. `+++++++++`: Increment cell 1 to 9.\n5. `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply cell 1 by 13 and store in cell 0.\n   - Cell 1 is 9, so this loop will run 9 times.\n   - Each iteration adds 13 to cell 0 and decrements cell 1.\n   - After 9 iterations, cell 0 will be 117 (9 * 13) and cell 1 will be 0.\n6. `<--`: Move to cell 0 and decrement twice, making it 115.\n7. `.`: Output the character for ASCII 115, which is 's'.\n8. `--------`: Decrement cell 0 by 8, making it 107.\n9. `.`: Output the character for ASCII 107, which is 'k'.\n10. `--`: Decrement cell 0 by 2, making it 105.\n11. `.`: Output the character for ASCII 105, which is 'i'.\n12. `----`: Decrement cell 0 by 4, making it 101.\n13. `.`: Output the character for ASCII 101, which is 'e'.\n14. `+++++++++++++`: Increment cell 0 by 13, making it 114.\n15. `.`: Output the character for ASCII 114, which is 'r'.\n16. `<`: Move to cell 1 (which is 0).\n\nThe final output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\n<<<skier>>>"
