    "To determine the output of the given Brainfuck program, we need to analyze it step by step. Brainfuck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a data pointer to manipulate data. The commands are as follows:\n\n- `>`: Move the data pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the data pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n- `[`: Jump forward to the command after the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the command after the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n\nLet's break down the program:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to cell 1 and set it to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to cell 2 and set it to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move back to cell 1.\n4. `++++++++`: Set cell 1 to 8.\n5. `[<++++++++++++++>-]`: Loop to set cell 0 to 96 (8 * 12) and cell 1 to 0.\n6. `<++`: Move to cell 0 and increment it by 2, making it 98.\n7. `.`: Output the character 'b' (ASCII 98).\n8. `>++++[<---->-]`: Move to cell 1, set it to 4, and loop to decrement cell 0 by 4 four times, making it 82.\n9. `<-.`: Decrement cell 0 by 1, making it 81, and output 'Q' (ASCII 81).\n10. `++++++++++++`: Increment cell 0 by 12, making it 93.\n11. `.`: Output the character ']' (ASCII 93).\n12. `--------`: Decrement cell 0 by 8, making it 85.\n13. `.`: Output the character 'U' (ASCII 85).\n14. `+++++++++`: Increment cell 0 by 9, making it 94.\n15. `.`: Output the character '^' (ASCII 94).\n16. `<`: Move to cell 1.\n\nThe output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\nThe final output of the program is:\n\n<<<bQ]U^>>>"
