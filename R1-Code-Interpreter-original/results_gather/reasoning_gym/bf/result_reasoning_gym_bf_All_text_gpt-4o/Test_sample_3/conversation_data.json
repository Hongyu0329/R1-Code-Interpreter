    "To analyze the given Brainf*ck code, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initialization and Setup:**\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to cell 1.\n   - `[-]`: Set cell 1 to 0 (in case it wasn't already).\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to cell 2.\n   - `[-]`: Set cell 2 to 0.\n   - `<`: Move the pointer back to cell 1.\n\n2. **Setting Up Values:**\n   - `>++++++++`: Move to cell 2 and increment it by 8.\n   - `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: This loop will run 8 times (since cell 2 is 8), and each time it will:\n     - Move to cell 1 and increment it by 13.\n     - Move back to cell 2 and decrement it by 1.\n   - After the loop, cell 1 will have 104 (8 * 13) and cell 2 will be 0.\n\n3. **Output Characters:**\n   - `<.`: Move to cell 1 and output its value as a character, which is 104 ('h').\n   - `---`: Decrement cell 1 by 3, making it 101.\n   - `.`: Output the character for 101 ('e').\n   - `+++++++++`: Increment cell 1 by 9, making it 110.\n   - `.`: Output the character for 110 ('n').\n   - `-----------`: Decrement cell 1 by 11, making it 99.\n   - `.`: Output the character for 99 ('c').\n   - `++`: Increment cell 1 by 2, making it 101.\n   - `.`: Output the character for 101 ('e').\n   - `<`: Move the pointer back to cell 0.\n\nThe final output of the code is the sequence of characters produced by these operations.\n\n**Output:** henc"
