    "To determine the output of the given Brainfuck program, we need to analyze it step by step. Brainfuck operates on an array of memory cells, each initially set to zero, and a data pointer that starts at the first cell. The commands are:\n\n- `>`: Increment the data pointer (move to the next cell).\n- `<`: Decrement the data pointer (move to the previous cell).\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n- `[`: Jump forward to the command after the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the command after the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n\nLet's break down the program:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the second cell and set it to zero.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the third cell and set it to zero.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the second cell.\n4. `+++++++`: Increment the second cell to 7.\n5. `[<++++++++++++++>-]`: Loop 7 times, each time:\n   - Move to the first cell, add 14, move back, and decrement the second cell.\n   - This results in the first cell being incremented by 98 (7 * 14).\n6. `<.`: Move to the first cell and output its value (98), which is 'b'.\n7. `>++++[<++++>-]`: Move to the second cell, increment it to 4, and loop 4 times:\n   - Move to the first cell, add 4, move back, and decrement the second cell.\n   - This results in the first cell being incremented by 16 (4 * 4), making it 114.\n8. `<.`: Move to the first cell and output its value (114), which is 'r'.\n9. `---------.`: Decrement the first cell by 9 to 105 and output it, which is 'i'.\n10. `------.`: Decrement the first cell by 6 to 99 and output it, which is 'c'.\n11. `++++++++.`: Increment the first cell by 8 to 107 and output it, which is 'k'.\n12. `<`: Move back to the second cell (not necessary for output).\n\nThe output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\nThe final output of the program is: <<<brick>>>"
