    "To analyze the given Brainfuck code, we need to understand how each command manipulates the memory tape and the pointer. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The tape starts with all cells set to 0, and the pointer is at the first cell.\n\n2. **`>`**: Move the pointer to the right (cell 1).\n\n3. **`[-]`**: Set the current cell (cell 1) to 0. This is a loop that decrements the cell until it reaches 0.\n\n4. **`>`**: Move the pointer to the right (cell 2).\n\n5. **`[-]`**: Set the current cell (cell 2) to 0.\n\n6. **`<`**: Move the pointer to the left (cell 1).\n\n7. **`>`**: Move the pointer to the right (cell 2).\n\n8. **`+++++++++`**: Increment the current cell (cell 2) by 9.\n\n9. **`[`**: Start a loop that continues while the current cell (cell 2) is not 0.\n\n10. **`<`**: Move the pointer to the left (cell 1).\n\n11. **`+++++++++++++`**: Increment the current cell (cell 1) by 13.\n\n12. **`>`**: Move the pointer to the right (cell 2).\n\n13. **`-`**: Decrement the current cell (cell 2) by 1.\n\n14. **`]`**: End of the loop. If the current cell (cell 2) is not 0, go back to step 9.\n\n   - This loop runs 9 times, so cell 1 ends up with a value of 117 (9 * 13).\n\n15. **`<`**: Move the pointer to the left (cell 1).\n\n16. **`-`**: Decrement the current cell (cell 1) by 1, making it 116.\n\n17. **`.`**: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in the current cell (cell 1), which is 't'.\n\n18. **`+`**: Increment the current cell (cell 1) by 1, making it 117.\n\n19. **`.`**: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in the current cell (cell 1), which is 'u'.\n\n20. **`---`**: Decrement the current cell (cell 1) by 3, making it 114.\n\n21. **`.`**: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in the current cell (cell 1), which is 'r'.\n\n22. **`>`**: Move the pointer to the right (cell 2).\n\n23. **`++++`**: Increment the current cell (cell 2) by 4.\n\n24. **`[`**: Start a loop that continues while the current cell (cell 2) is not 0.\n\n25. **`<`**: Move the pointer to the left (cell 1).\n\n26. **`----`**: Decrement the current cell (cell 1) by 4, making it 110.\n\n27. **`>`**: Move the pointer to the right (cell 2).\n\n28. **`-`**: Decrement the current cell (cell 2) by 1.\n\n29. **`]`**: End of the loop. If the current cell (cell 2) is not 0, go back to step 24.\n\n   - This loop runs 4 times, so cell 1 ends up with a value of 98 (110 - 4 * 3).\n\n30. **`.`**: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in the current cell (cell 1), which is 'n'.\n\n31. **`+++++++++++++`**: Increment the current cell (cell 1) by 13, making it 111.\n\n32. **`.`**: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in the current cell (cell 1), which is 'o'.\n\n33. **`<`**: Move the pointer to the left (cell 0).\n\nThe final output of the code is the sequence of characters: \"turno\"."
