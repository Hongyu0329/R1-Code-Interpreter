    "To determine the output of the given Brainfuck program, we need to analyze it step by step. Brainfuck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a pointer to manipulate data. The commands are as follows:\n\n- `>`: Move the pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n- `[`: Jump forward to the command after the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the command after the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n\nLet's break down the program:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to cell 1 and set it to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to cell 2 and set it to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move back to cell 1.\n4. `++++++++++`: Increment cell 1 by 10.\n5. `[<++++++++++>-]`: Loop until cell 1 is 0, incrementing cell 0 by 10 each time. This results in cell 0 being 100 and cell 1 being 0.\n6. `<`: Move to cell 0.\n7. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in cell 0, which is 100 ('d').\n8. `---`: Decrement cell 0 by 3, resulting in 97.\n9. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in cell 0, which is 97 ('a').\n10. `+++++++++++`: Increment cell 0 by 11, resulting in 108.\n11. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in cell 0, which is 108 ('l').\n12. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in cell 0, which is 108 ('l').\n13. `+++++++++++++`: Increment cell 0 by 13, resulting in 121.\n14. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in cell 0, which is 121 ('y').\n15. `<`: Move to cell 1.\n\nThe final output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\n<<<dally>>>"
