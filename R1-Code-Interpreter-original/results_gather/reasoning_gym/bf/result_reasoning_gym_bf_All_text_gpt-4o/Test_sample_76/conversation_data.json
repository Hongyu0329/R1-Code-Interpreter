    "To analyze the Brainf*ck program, we need to understand how each command works:\n\n- `>`: Move the pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n- `[`: Jump past the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n\nLet's break down the program step by step:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to cell 1 and set it to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to cell 2 and set it to 0.\n3. `<`: Move back to cell 1.\n4. `>`: Move to cell 2.\n5. `+++++++`: Set cell 2 to 7.\n6. `[<++++++++++++++>-]`: Loop 7 times, each time:\n   - Move to cell 1, add 14 (set cell 1 to 98 after 7 iterations).\n   - Move back to cell 2, decrement it.\n7. `<`: Move to cell 1.\n8. `.`: Output the character represented by the value in cell 1 (98, which is 'b').\n9. `-.`: Decrement cell 1 twice (set it to 96).\n10. `.`: Output the character represented by the value in cell 1 (96, which is '`').\n11. `++++++++++`: Increment cell 1 by 10 (set it to 106).\n12. `.`: Output the character represented by the value in cell 1 (106, which is 'j').\n13. `------`: Decrement cell 1 by 6 (set it to 100).\n14. `.`: Output the character represented by the value in cell 1 (100, which is 'd').\n15. `+++++++++++++`: Increment cell 1 by 13 (set it to 113).\n16. `.`: Output the character represented by the value in cell 1 (113, which is 'q').\n17. `<`: Move to cell 0.\n\nThe output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\nTherefore, the output of the program is:\n\n<<<b`jdq>>>"
