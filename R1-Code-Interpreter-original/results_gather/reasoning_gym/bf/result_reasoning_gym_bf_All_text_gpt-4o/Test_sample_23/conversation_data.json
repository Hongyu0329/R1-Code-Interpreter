    "To analyze the Brainf*ck program, we need to understand how each command works:\n\n- `>`: Move the pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n- `[`: Jump past the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n\nLet's break down the program step by step:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to cell 1 and set it to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to cell 2 and set it to 0.\n3. `<`: Move back to cell 1.\n4. `>++++++++`: Move to cell 2 and set it to 8.\n5. `[<++++++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply cell 2 by 14 and store the result in cell 1.\n   - Cell 2 starts at 8.\n   - Cell 1 is incremented by 14, eight times (8 * 14 = 112).\n   - Cell 2 is decremented to 0.\n6. `<`: Move to cell 0.\n7. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in cell 0 (112, which is 'p').\n8. `++.`: Increment cell 0 to 114 and output (114, which is 'r').\n9. `---------.`: Decrement cell 0 to 105 and output (105, which is 'i').\n10. `++++.`: Increment cell 0 to 109 and output (109, which is 'm').\n11. `++.`: Increment cell 0 to 111 and output (111, which is 'o').\n12. `<`: Move to cell 1.\n\nThe output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\nTherefore, the final output of the program is:\n\n<<<primo>>>"
