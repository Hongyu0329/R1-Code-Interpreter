    "To analyze the given Brainfuck code, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initialization and Setup:**\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to cell 1.\n   - `[-]`: Set cell 1 to 0.\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to cell 2.\n   - `[-]`: Set cell 2 to 0.\n   - `<`: Move the pointer back to cell 1.\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to cell 2.\n\n2. **First Loop:**\n   - `++++++++`: Increment cell 2 by 8.\n   - `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: This loop will run 8 times (since cell 2 is 8), and each time it will:\n     - Move to cell 1 (`<`), increment it by 13 (`+++++++++++++`), and move back to cell 2 (`>`).\n     - Decrement cell 2 by 1 (`-`).\n   - After the loop, cell 1 will be 104 (8 * 13) and cell 2 will be 0.\n\n3. **Output First Character:**\n   - `<`: Move to cell 1.\n   - `.`: Output the ASCII character for the value in cell 1, which is 104 ('h').\n\n4. **Second Character:**\n   - `+++++++++++++`: Increment cell 1 by 13, making it 117.\n   - `.`: Output the ASCII character for the value in cell 1, which is 117 ('u').\n\n5. **Third Character:**\n   - `---`: Decrement cell 1 by 3, making it 114.\n   - `.`: Output the ASCII character for the value in cell 1, which is 114 ('r').\n\n6. **Fourth Character:**\n   - `.`: Output the ASCII character for the value in cell 1 again, which is still 114 ('r').\n\n7. **Fifth Character:**\n   - `+++++++`: Increment cell 1 by 7, making it 121.\n   - `.`: Output the ASCII character for the value in cell 1, which is 121 ('y').\n\n8. **Sixth Character:**\n   - `<`: Move to cell 0.\n   - `.`: Output the ASCII character for the value in cell 0, which is 0 (null character, often not visible).\n\nThe final output of the code is the string \"hurry\" followed by a null character. However, the null character is typically not visible in standard text output.\n\n**Output:** hurry"
