    "To analyze the given Brainfuck program, we need to understand how each command manipulates the memory tape and the pointer. Brainfuck operates on an array of memory cells, each initially set to zero, and a data pointer that starts at the first cell. The commands are:\n\n- `>`: Move the data pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the data pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n- `[`: Jump forward to the command after the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the command after the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n\nLet's break down the program step by step:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the second cell and set it to zero.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the third cell and set it to zero.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the second cell.\n4. `++++++++`: Increment the second cell to 8.\n5. `[<++++++++++++++>-]`: This loop will run 8 times (since the second cell is 8), and each time it will:\n   - Move to the first cell, increment it by 14 (since `++++++++++++++` is 14 pluses).\n   - Move back to the second cell and decrement it by 1.\n   After the loop, the first cell will be 112 (8 * 14) and the second cell will be 0.\n6. `<.`: Move to the first cell and output its value as a character. The ASCII value 112 corresponds to the character 'p'.\n7. `-----------`: Decrement the first cell by 11, resulting in 101.\n8. `.`: Output the value of the first cell as a character. The ASCII value 101 corresponds to the character 'e'.\n9. `+++++++++`: Increment the first cell by 9, resulting in 110.\n10. `.`: Output the value of the first cell as a character. The ASCII value 110 corresponds to the character 'n'.\n11. `.`: Output the value of the first cell as a character again, which is still 'n'.\n12. `---------.`: Decrement the first cell by 9, resulting in 101, and output it as a character. The ASCII value 101 corresponds to the character 'e'.\n13. `<`: Move to the second cell, which is 0, but no further operations are performed on it.\n\nThe output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\nTherefore, the final output of the program is:\n\n<<<penne>>>"
