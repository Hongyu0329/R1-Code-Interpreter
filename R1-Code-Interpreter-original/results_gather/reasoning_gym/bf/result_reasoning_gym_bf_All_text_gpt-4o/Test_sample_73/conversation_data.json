    "To analyze the given Brainf*ck program, we need to understand how each command manipulates the memory tape and the data pointer. Brainf*ck uses a memory tape of cells initialized to zero, and a data pointer that starts at the first cell. The commands are:\n\n- `>`: Move the data pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the data pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n- `[`: Jump past the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n\nLet's break down the program step by step:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to cell 1 and set it to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to cell 2 and set it to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move back to cell 1.\n4. `+++++++++`: Increment cell 1 to 9.\n5. `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply cell 1 by 13 and store in cell 0.\n   - Cell 1 starts at 9, so this loop will run 9 times.\n   - Each iteration adds 13 to cell 0 and decrements cell 1.\n   - After 9 iterations, cell 0 will be 117 (9 * 13) and cell 1 will be 0.\n6. `<--`: Move to cell 0 and decrement twice, resulting in 115.\n7. `.`: Output the character corresponding to ASCII 115, which is 's'.\n8. `--------`: Decrement cell 0 by 8, resulting in 107.\n9. `.`: Output the character corresponding to ASCII 107, which is 'k'.\n10. `++++++++++`: Increment cell 0 by 10, resulting in 117.\n11. `.`: Output the character corresponding to ASCII 117, which is 'u'.\n12. `---------`: Decrement cell 0 by 9, resulting in 108.\n13. `.`: Output the character corresponding to ASCII 108, which is 'l'.\n14. `..<`: Output the character corresponding to ASCII 108 again, which is 'l'.\n\nThe final output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\n<<<skull>>>"
