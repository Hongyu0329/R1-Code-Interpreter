    "To analyze the given Brainf*ck program, we need to understand how each command works and how they manipulate the memory tape. Brainf*ck uses a memory tape with cells initialized to zero, and a data pointer that starts at the first cell. The commands are:\n\n- `>`: Move the data pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the data pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n- `[`: Jump past the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n- `,`: Input a byte and store it in the byte at the data pointer (not used in this program).\n\nLet's break down the program step by step:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the second cell and set it to zero.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the third cell and set it to zero.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the second cell.\n4. `+++++++++`: Increment the second cell to 9.\n5. `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply the second cell by 13 and store the result in the first cell. This results in the first cell being 117 (9 * 13).\n6. `<+.`: Move to the first cell and output it as a character. The ASCII value 117 corresponds to 'u'.\n7. `>++++[<---->-]`: Move to the second cell, increment it by 4, and then loop to subtract 4 from it until it reaches zero. This effectively resets the second cell to zero.\n8. `<-.`: Move to the first cell, decrement it by 1 (making it 116), and output it as a character. The ASCII value 116 corresponds to 't'.\n9. `+++++++++++++.`: Increment the first cell by 13 (making it 129) and output it as a character. The ASCII value 129 is a non-printable character, but in some extended ASCII tables, it might correspond to a special character.\n10. `++++.`: Increment the first cell by 4 (making it 133) and output it as a character. The ASCII value 133 is also a non-printable character, but in some extended ASCII tables, it might correspond to a special character.\n11. `>++++[<---->-]`: Move to the second cell, increment it by 4, and then loop to subtract 4 from it until it reaches zero. This effectively resets the second cell to zero.\n12. `<-.`: Move to the first cell, decrement it by 1 (making it 132), and output it as a character. The ASCII value 132 is also a non-printable character, but in some extended ASCII tables, it might correspond to a special character.\n\nThe output of the program is a sequence of characters based on the ASCII values of the cells when they are output. The printable characters are 'u' and 't', while the others are non-printable or special characters in extended ASCII.\n\nThe exact output of the program is:\n\n<<<ut>>>"
