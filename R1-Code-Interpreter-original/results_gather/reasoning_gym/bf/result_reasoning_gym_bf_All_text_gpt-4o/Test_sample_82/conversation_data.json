    "To analyze the given Brainf*ck program, we need to understand how each command works and how they manipulate the memory tape. Brainf*ck uses a memory tape with cells initialized to zero, and a data pointer that starts at the first cell. The commands are:\n\n- `>`: Move the data pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the data pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n- `[`: Jump forward to the command after the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the command after the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n\nLet's break down the program step by step:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the second cell and set it to zero.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the third cell and set it to zero.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the second cell.\n4. `+++++++++`: Increment the second cell to 9.\n5. `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply the value in the second cell by 13 and store it in the first cell. This results in the first cell having a value of 117 (9 * 13).\n6. `<.`: Move to the first cell and output its value as a character, which is 'u' (ASCII 117).\n7. `-------`: Decrement the first cell by 7, resulting in 110.\n8. `.`: Output the value of the first cell as a character, which is 'n' (ASCII 110).\n9. `++++++`: Increment the first cell by 6, resulting in 116.\n10. `.`: Output the value of the first cell as a character, which is 't' (ASCII 116).\n11. `-----------`: Decrement the first cell by 11, resulting in 105.\n12. `.`: Output the value of the first cell as a character, which is 'i' (ASCII 105).\n13. `+++`: Increment the first cell by 3, resulting in 108.\n14. `.`: Output the value of the first cell as a character, which is 'l' (ASCII 108).\n15. `<`: Move to the second cell.\n\nThe program outputs the characters 'u', 'n', 't', 'i', 'l' in sequence.\n\nTherefore, the output of the program is:\n\n<<<until>>>"
