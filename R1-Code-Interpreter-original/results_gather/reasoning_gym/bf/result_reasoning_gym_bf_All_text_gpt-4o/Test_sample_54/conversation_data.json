    "To analyze the given Brainf*ck code, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initialization and Setup:**\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to cell 1.\n   - `[-]`: Set cell 1 to 0.\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to cell 2.\n   - `[-]`: Set cell 2 to 0.\n   - `<`: Move the pointer back to cell 1.\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to cell 2.\n\n2. **First Loop:**\n   - `++++++++`: Increment cell 2 by 8.\n   - `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: This loop will run 8 times (since cell 2 is 8), and each time it will:\n     - Move to cell 1 (`<`), increment it by 13 (`+++++++++++++`), and move back to cell 2 (`>`).\n     - Decrement cell 2 by 1 (`-`).\n   - After the loop, cell 1 will be 104 (8 * 13) and cell 2 will be 0.\n\n3. **Output and Further Operations:**\n   - `<-.`: Move to cell 1 and output its value as a character, then decrement it by 1. The ASCII value 104 corresponds to 'h', so it outputs 'h'.\n   - `+++++++++++.`: Increment cell 1 by 10 (making it 113) and output it as a character. The ASCII value 113 corresponds to 'q', so it outputs 'q'.\n   - `---.`: Decrement cell 1 by 3 (making it 110) and output it as a character. The ASCII value 110 corresponds to 'n', so it outputs 'n'.\n   - `++++++++.`: Increment cell 1 by 8 (making it 118) and output it as a character. The ASCII value 118 corresponds to 'v', so it outputs 'v'.\n   - `-----------.`: Decrement cell 1 by 11 (making it 107) and output it as a character. The ASCII value 107 corresponds to 'k', so it outputs 'k'.\n   - `<`: Move the pointer to cell 0 (though this does not affect the output).\n\nThe final output of the code is the sequence of characters produced by the output commands.\n\n**Output:** hqnvk"
