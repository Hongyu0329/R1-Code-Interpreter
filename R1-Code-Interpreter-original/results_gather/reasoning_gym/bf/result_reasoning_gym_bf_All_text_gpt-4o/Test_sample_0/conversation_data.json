    "To analyze the Brainf*ck program, we need to understand how each command works:\n\n- `>`: Move the pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n- `[`: Jump past the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n\nLet's break down the program step by step:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to cell 1 and set it to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to cell 2 and set it to 0.\n3. `<`: Move back to cell 1.\n4. `>`: Move to cell 2.\n5. `++++++++`: Set cell 2 to 8.\n6. `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply cell 2 by 13 and store in cell 1.\n   - Move to cell 1, add 13, move back to cell 2, decrement cell 2.\n   - Repeat until cell 2 is 0.\n   - Cell 1 ends up with 104 (8 * 13).\n7. `<`: Move to cell 1.\n8. `.`: Output the character corresponding to 104, which is 'h'.\n9. `---`: Decrement cell 1 by 3, making it 101.\n10. `.`: Output the character corresponding to 101, which is 'e'.\n11. `++++`: Increment cell 1 by 4, making it 105.\n12. `.`: Output the character corresponding to 105, which is 'i'.\n13. `++++++++++`: Increment cell 1 by 10, making it 115.\n14. `.`: Output the character corresponding to 115, which is 's'.\n15. `+`: Increment cell 1 by 1, making it 116.\n16. `.`: Output the character corresponding to 116, which is 't'.\n17. `.`: Output the character corresponding to 116 again, which is 't'.\n18. `<`: Move back to cell 0.\n\nThe output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\nTherefore, the final output of the program is:\n\n<<<heistt>>>"
