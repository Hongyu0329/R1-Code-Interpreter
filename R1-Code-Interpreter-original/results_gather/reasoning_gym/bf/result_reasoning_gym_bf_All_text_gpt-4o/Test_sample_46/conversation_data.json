    "To analyze the Brainf*ck program, we need to understand how each command works:\n\n- `>`: Move the pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n- `[`: Jump past the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n\nLet's break down the program step by step:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to cell 1 and set it to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to cell 2 and set it to 0.\n3. `<`: Move back to cell 1.\n4. `>`: Move to cell 2.\n5. `+++++++++`: Set cell 2 to 9.\n6. `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: Loop until cell 2 is 0:\n   - Move to cell 1, add 13 (set cell 1 to 13), move back to cell 2, and decrement cell 2.\n   - This loop runs 9 times, setting cell 1 to 117 (13 * 9).\n7. `<`: Move to cell 1.\n8. `--`: Decrement cell 1 by 2, setting it to 115.\n9. `.`: Output the character represented by cell 1 (ASCII 115, which is 's').\n10. `---`: Decrement cell 1 by 3, setting it to 112.\n11. `.`: Output the character represented by cell 1 (ASCII 112, which is 'p').\n12. `-------`: Decrement cell 1 by 7, setting it to 105.\n13. `.`: Output the character represented by cell 1 (ASCII 105, which is 'i').\n14. `+++++`: Increment cell 1 by 5, setting it to 110.\n15. `.`: Output the character represented by cell 1 (ASCII 110, which is 'n').\n16. `+++++++++++`: Increment cell 1 by 11, setting it to 121.\n17. `.`: Output the character represented by cell 1 (ASCII 121, which is 'y').\n18. `<`: Move to cell 0 (though this has no effect on output).\n\nThe output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\nTherefore, the output of the program is:\n\n<<<spiny>>>"
