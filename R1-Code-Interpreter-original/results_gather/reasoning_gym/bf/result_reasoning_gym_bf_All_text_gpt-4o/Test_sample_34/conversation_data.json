    "To analyze the given Brainf*ck code, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initialization and Setup:**\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to cell 1.\n   - `[-]`: Set cell 1 to 0.\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to cell 2.\n   - `[-]`: Set cell 2 to 0.\n   - `<`: Move the pointer back to cell 1.\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to cell 2.\n\n2. **Main Loop to Set Values:**\n   - `+++++++++`: Increment cell 2 by 9.\n   - `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: This loop will run 9 times (since cell 2 is 9), and for each iteration:\n     - `<`: Move to cell 1.\n     - `+++++++++++++`: Increment cell 1 by 13.\n     - `>`: Move back to cell 2.\n     - `-`: Decrement cell 2 by 1.\n   - After the loop, cell 1 will be 117 (9 * 13) and cell 2 will be 0.\n\n3. **Adjustments and Output:**\n   - `<`: Move to cell 1.\n   - `--`: Decrement cell 1 by 2, making it 115.\n   - `.`: Output the character represented by ASCII value 115, which is 's'.\n   - `-----`: Decrement cell 1 by 5, making it 110.\n   - `.`: Output the character represented by ASCII value 110, which is 'n'.\n   - `+`: Increment cell 1 by 1, making it 111.\n   - `.`: Output the character represented by ASCII value 111, which is 'o'.\n   - `++++++`: Increment cell 1 by 6, making it 117.\n   - `.`: Output the character represented by ASCII value 117, which is 'u'.\n   - `-`: Decrement cell 1 by 1, making it 116.\n   - `.`: Output the character represented by ASCII value 116, which is 't'.\n   - `.`: Output the character represented by ASCII value 116 again, which is 't'.\n   - `<`: Move to cell 0 (though this is not necessary for output).\n\nThe final output of the code is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\n**Output:** snoutt"
