    "To analyze the given Brainf*ck code, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initialization and Setup:**\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to cell 1.\n   - `[-]`: Set cell 1 to 0 (in case it wasn't already).\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to cell 2.\n   - `[-]`: Set cell 2 to 0 (in case it wasn't already).\n   - `<`: Move the pointer back to cell 1.\n\n2. **Main Loop to Set Values:**\n   - `>+++++++++[<+++++++++++++>-]`: This loop will set cell 1 to 120.\n     - `>+++++++++`: Increment cell 2 by 9.\n     - `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: This loop will run 9 times, each time adding 13 to cell 1 and decrementing cell 2 by 1.\n     - After the loop, cell 1 will have 9 * 13 = 117, and cell 2 will be 0.\n   - `<`: Move the pointer back to cell 1.\n   - `--`: Decrement cell 1 by 2, making it 115.\n\n3. **Output Characters:**\n   - `.`: Output the character corresponding to ASCII value 115, which is 's'.\n   - `+.`: Increment cell 1 by 1 (making it 116) and output the character 't'.\n   - `---------------`: Decrement cell 1 by 15, making it 101.\n   - `.`: Output the character corresponding to ASCII value 101, which is 'e'.\n   - `.`: Output the character 'e' again.\n   - `-.`: Decrement cell 1 by 1 (making it 100) and output the character 'd'.\n\n4. **Final Output:**\n   - The sequence of characters outputted is \"steed\".\n\nTherefore, the exact output of the code is:\n\n```\nsteed\n```"
