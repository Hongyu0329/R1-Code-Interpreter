    "To analyze the given Brainf*ck code, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initialization and Setup:**\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to the second cell.\n   - `[-]`: Set the second cell to 0.\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to the third cell.\n   - `[-]`: Set the third cell to 0.\n   - `<`: Move the pointer back to the second cell.\n\n2. **First Loop:**\n   - `>++++++++++`: Set the third cell to 10.\n   - `[<+++++++++++>-]`: This loop will run 10 times (since the third cell is 10), and each time it will:\n     - Move to the second cell and add 13 (since `+++++++++++` is 13 pluses).\n     - Move back to the third cell and decrement it by 1.\n   - After the loop, the second cell will have 130 (10 * 13) and the third cell will be 0.\n\n3. **Output Characters:**\n   - `<`: Move to the second cell.\n   - `+`: Increment the second cell to 131.\n   - `.`: Output the character with ASCII value 131, which is '' (a non-printable character).\n   - `+++++++++.`: Increment the second cell by 9 to 140 and output the character with ASCII value 140, which is '' (a non-printable character).\n   - `---------------.`: Decrement the second cell by 15 to 125 and output the character with ASCII value 125, which is '}'.\n   - `-----.`: Decrement the second cell by 5 to 120 and output the character with ASCII value 120, which is 'x'.\n   - `+.`: Increment the second cell by 1 to 121 and output the character with ASCII value 121, which is 'y'.\n   - `<`: Move to the first cell (though this has no effect on output).\n\nThe final output of the code is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands:\n\n}xy"
