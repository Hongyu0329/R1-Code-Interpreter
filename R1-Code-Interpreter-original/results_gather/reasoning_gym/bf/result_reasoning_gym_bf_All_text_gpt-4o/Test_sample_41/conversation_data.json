    "To determine the output of the given Brainfuck program, we need to analyze it step by step. Brainfuck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a data pointer. The commands are:\n\n- `>`: Move the data pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the data pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n- `[`: Jump forward to the command after the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the command after the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n- `,`: Input a byte and store it in the byte at the data pointer (not used in this program).\n\nLet's break down the program:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to cell 1 and set it to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to cell 2 and set it to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move back to cell 1.\n4. `+++++++++`: Increment cell 1 to 9.\n5. `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply cell 1 by 13 and store in cell 0. Cell 1 becomes 0, cell 0 becomes 117.\n6. `<--`: Move to cell 0 and decrement twice, making it 115.\n7. `.`: Output the character 's' (ASCII 115).\n8. `++++.`: Increment cell 0 to 119 and output 'w' (ASCII 119).\n9. `>+++[<------->-]<-.`: Move to cell 1, increment to 3, loop to subtract 21 from cell 0, making it 98, and decrement to 97. Output 'a' (ASCII 97).\n10. `>++++[<++++>-]<+.`: Move to cell 2, increment to 4, loop to add 16 to cell 1, making it 16, and increment to 17. Output 'q' (ASCII 113).\n11. `-----.`: Decrement cell 1 to 112 and output 'p' (ASCII 112).\n12. `<`: Move back to cell 1.\n\nThe output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\nThe final output of the program is:\n\n<<<swap>>>"
