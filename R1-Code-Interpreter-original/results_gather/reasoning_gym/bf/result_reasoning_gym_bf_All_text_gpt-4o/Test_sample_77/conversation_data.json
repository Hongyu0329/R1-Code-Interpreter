    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck program, we need to analyze it step by step. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a pointer to manipulate data. The commands are as follows:\n\n- `>`: Move the pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n- `[`: Jump forward to the command after the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the command after the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n- `,`: Input a byte and store it in the byte at the data pointer (not used in this program).\n\nLet's break down the program:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move the pointer to cell 1 and set it to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move the pointer to cell 2 and set it to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move back to cell 1.\n4. `+++++++++[<+++++++++++++>-]`: \n   - `+++++++++` sets cell 1 to 9.\n   - `[<+++++++++++++>-]` is a loop that runs 9 times, incrementing cell 0 by 13 each time (9 * 13 = 117).\n   - After the loop, cell 1 is 0, and cell 0 is 117.\n5. `<+.`: Move to cell 0, increment it by 1 (making it 118), and output it as a character ('v').\n6. `>++++[<---->-]`: \n   - Move to cell 1, set it to 4.\n   - `[<---->-]` is a loop that runs 4 times, decrementing cell 0 by 4 each time (4 * 4 = 16).\n   - After the loop, cell 1 is 0, and cell 0 is 102.\n7. `<-.`: Move to cell 0, decrement it by 1 (making it 101), and output it as a character ('e').\n8. `+++++++++.`: Increment cell 0 by 9 (making it 110) and output it as a character ('n').\n9. `+++++++.`: Increment cell 0 by 7 (making it 117) and output it as a character ('u').\n10. `>++++[<---->-]`: \n    - Move to cell 1, set it to 4.\n    - `[<---->-]` is a loop that runs 4 times, decrementing cell 0 by 4 each time (4 * 4 = 16).\n    - After the loop, cell 1 is 0, and cell 0 is 101.\n11. `<.`: Move to cell 0 and output it as a character ('e').\n\nThe final output of the program is the concatenation of these characters.\n\n<<<venue>>>"
