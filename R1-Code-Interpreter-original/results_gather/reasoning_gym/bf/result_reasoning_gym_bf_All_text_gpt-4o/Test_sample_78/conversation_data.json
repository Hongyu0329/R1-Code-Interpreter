    "To determine the output of the given Brainfuck program, we need to analyze it step by step. Brainfuck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a data pointer. The commands are:\n\n- `>`: Move the data pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the data pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n- `[`: Jump forward to the command after the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the command after the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n- `,`: Input a byte and store it in the byte at the data pointer (not used in this program).\n\nLet's break down the program:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to cell 1 and set it to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to cell 2 and set it to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move back to cell 1.\n4. `++++++++`: Increment cell 1 by 8.\n5. `[<++++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply cell 1 by 12 and store the result in cell 0. This results in cell 0 being 96 (8 * 12).\n6. `<+.`: Move to cell 0 and output its value as a character. ASCII 96 is '`'.\n7. `>++++[<+++++>-]`: Move to cell 1, increment it by 4, and multiply by 5, storing the result in cell 2. This results in cell 2 being 20 (4 * 5).\n8. `<.`: Move to cell 1 and output its value as a character. ASCII 4 is a non-printable character.\n9. `>++++[<---->-]`: Move to cell 2, increment it by 4, and multiply by -4, storing the result in cell 3. This results in cell 3 being -16, but since Brainfuck uses unsigned bytes, it wraps around to 240.\n10. `<-.`: Move to cell 2 and output its value as a character. ASCII 20 is a non-printable character.\n11. `+++++.`: Increment cell 2 by 5, making it 25, and output it. ASCII 25 is a non-printable character.\n12. `++++++.`: Increment cell 2 by 6, making it 31, and output it. ASCII 31 is a non-printable character.\n13. `<`: Move back to cell 1.\n\nThe program outputs several non-printable characters and one printable character '`'. The exact output depends on how non-printable characters are handled, but typically they are ignored or represented as empty output.\n\nThe final output of the program is:\n\n<<<`>>>"
