    "To analyze the Brainf*ck program, we need to understand how each command works:\n\n- `>`: Move the pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n- `[`: Jump past the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n\nLet's break down the program step by step:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to cell 1 and set it to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to cell 2 and set it to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move back to cell 1.\n4. `+++++++++`: Set cell 1 to 9.\n5. `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply cell 1 by 13 and store in cell 0.\n   - Cell 0 becomes 117 (9 * 13).\n6. `<--`: Move to cell 0 and decrement twice, making it 115.\n7. `.`: Output the character represented by ASCII 115, which is 's'.\n8. `-----------`: Decrement cell 0 by 11, making it 104.\n9. `.`: Output the character represented by ASCII 104, which is 'h'.\n10. `++++++++++`: Increment cell 0 by 10, making it 114.\n11. `.`: Output the character represented by ASCII 114, which is 'r'.\n12. `+++`: Increment cell 0 by 3, making it 117.\n13. `.`: Output the character represented by ASCII 117, which is 'u'.\n14. `>+++[<------>-]`: Move to cell 1, increment by 3, loop to subtract 6 from cell 1 and add to cell 0.\n    - Cell 1 becomes 0, cell 0 becomes 111.\n15. `-.`: Decrement cell 0 by 1, making it 110, and output 'n'.\n16. `<`: Move back to cell 0.\n\nThe output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\nTherefore, the final output of the program is:\n\n<<<shrun>>>"
