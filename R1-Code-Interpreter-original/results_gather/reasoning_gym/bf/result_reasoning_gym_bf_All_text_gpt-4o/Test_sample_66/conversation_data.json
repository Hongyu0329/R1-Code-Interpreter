    "To analyze the Brainf*ck program, we need to understand how each command works and how they manipulate the memory tape. The Brainf*ck language uses a memory tape with cells initialized to zero, and a data pointer that starts at the first cell. The commands are:\n\n- `>`: Move the data pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the data pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n- `[`: Jump forward to the command after the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the command after the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n\nLet's break down the program step by step:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the second cell and set it to zero.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the third cell and set it to zero.\n3. `<`: Move back to the second cell.\n4. `>++++++++++`: Move to the third cell and set it to 10.\n5. `[<+++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply 10 by 11, resulting in 110 in the second cell.\n   - Move to the second cell, add 11, move back, decrement the third cell.\n   - Repeat until the third cell is zero.\n6. `<+.`: Move to the first cell, increment it by 1, and output it as a character ('A').\n7. `-------------`: Decrement the first cell by 13, resulting in -12 (244 in unsigned 8-bit).\n8. `.`: Output the first cell as a character ('ô').\n9. `+++`: Increment the first cell by 3, resulting in 247.\n10. `.`: Output the first cell as a character ('÷').\n11. `++++++++++++++`: Increment the first cell by 14, resulting in 5.\n12. `.`: Output the first cell as a character (ENQ, non-printable).\n13. `--------------`: Decrement the first cell by 14, resulting in -9 (247 in unsigned 8-bit).\n14. `.`: Output the first cell as a character ('÷').\n15. `<`: Move to the second cell.\n\nThe output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands. The non-printable character (ENQ) is typically not visible in standard text output.\n\nThe final output of the program is:\n\n<<<Aô÷÷>>>"
