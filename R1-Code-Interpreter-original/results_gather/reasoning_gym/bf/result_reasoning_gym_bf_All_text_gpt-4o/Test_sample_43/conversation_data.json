    "To analyze the given Brainf*ck code, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initialization and Setup:**\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to the second cell.\n   - `[-]`: Set the second cell to 0.\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to the third cell.\n   - `[-]`: Set the third cell to 0.\n   - `<`: Move the pointer back to the second cell.\n\n2. **First Loop:**\n   - `>++++++++`: Increment the third cell by 8.\n   - `[<++++++++++++++>-]`: This loop will run 8 times (since the third cell is 8), and each time it will:\n     - Move to the second cell and add 14 (incrementing it by 14 each time).\n     - Move back to the third cell and decrement it by 1.\n   - After the loop, the second cell will have 8 * 14 = 112, and the third cell will be 0.\n\n3. **Output and Modifications:**\n   - `<`: Move to the second cell.\n   - `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value 112, which is 'p'.\n   - `-.`: Decrement the second cell by 1 (111) and output the character 'o'.\n   - `++++++`: Increment the second cell by 6 (117).\n   - `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value 117, which is 'u'.\n   - `-.`: Decrement the second cell by 1 (116) and output the character 't'.\n   - `+++++`: Increment the second cell by 5 (121).\n   - `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value 121, which is 'y'.\n   - `<`: Move to the first cell (which is 0).\n\nThe final output of the code is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\n**Output: \"pouty\"**"
