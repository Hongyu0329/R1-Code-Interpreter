    "To analyze the Brainf*ck program, we need to understand how each command works:\n\n- `>`: Move the pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n- `[`: Jump past the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n\nLet's break down the program step by step:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to cell 1 and set it to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to cell 2 and set it to 0.\n3. `<`: Move back to cell 1.\n4. `>++++++++`: Move to cell 2 and set it to 8.\n5. `[<++++++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply cell 2 by 14 and store the result in cell 1. This results in cell 1 being 112 and cell 2 being 0.\n6. `<++`: Move to cell 0 and increment it to 2.\n7. `.`: Output the character represented by cell 0, which is ASCII 2 (non-printable).\n8. `-------------.`: Decrement cell 0 by 13 to -11, then output (non-printable).\n9. `+++++++++.`: Increment cell 0 by 9 to -2, then output (non-printable).\n10. `-------------.`: Decrement cell 0 by 13 to -15, then output (non-printable).\n11. `+++++++++++.<`: Increment cell 0 by 11 to -4, then output (non-printable).\n\nThe program outputs non-printable characters, which are not visible as standard text. Therefore, the output is a series of non-printable characters.\n\n<<<>>>"
