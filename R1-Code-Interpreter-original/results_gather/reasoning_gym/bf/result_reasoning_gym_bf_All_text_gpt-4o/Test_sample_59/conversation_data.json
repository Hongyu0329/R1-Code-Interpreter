    "To analyze the Brainf*ck program, we need to understand how each command works and how they manipulate the memory tape. Brainf*ck uses a memory tape with cells initialized to zero, and a data pointer that starts at the first cell. The commands are:\n\n- `>`: Move the data pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the data pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n- `[`: Jump forward to the command after the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the command after the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n\nLet's break down the program step by step:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the second cell and set it to zero.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the third cell and set it to zero.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the second cell.\n4. `++++++++`: Increment the second cell to 8.\n5. `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply the second cell by 13 and store the result in the first cell:\n   - Move to the first cell, add 13, move back to the second cell, decrement it.\n   - Repeat until the second cell is zero. The first cell now contains 104 (8 * 13).\n6. `<-.`: Move to the first cell, decrement it to 103, and output 'g'.\n7. `+++++.`: Increment the first cell to 108 and output 'l'.\n8. `-----------.`: Decrement the first cell to 97 and output 'a'.\n9. `>+++[<++++++>-]`: Move to the second cell, increment it to 3, and multiply by 6 to store 18 in the first cell.\n10. `<..`: Move to the first cell and output twice:\n    - First output: 18 as a character, which is a non-printable control character.\n    - Second output: 18 again as a character, which is another non-printable control character.\n\nThe final output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\n<<<gla>>>\n"
