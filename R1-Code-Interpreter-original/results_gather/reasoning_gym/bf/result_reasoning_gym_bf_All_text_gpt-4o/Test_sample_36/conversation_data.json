    "To analyze the Brainf*ck program, we need to understand how each command works:\n\n- `>`: Move the pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n- `[`: Jump past the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n\nLet's break down the program step by step:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to cell 1 and set it to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to cell 2 and set it to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move back to cell 1.\n4. `+++++++++`: Increment cell 1 to 9.\n5. `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply cell 1 by 13 and store the result in cell 0.\n   - Cell 1 starts at 9.\n   - Each iteration adds 13 to cell 0 and decrements cell 1.\n   - After 9 iterations, cell 0 becomes 117 (9 * 13) and cell 1 becomes 0.\n6. `<--`: Move to cell 0 and decrement twice, resulting in 115.\n7. `.`: Output the character corresponding to ASCII 115, which is 's'.\n8. `+.`: Increment cell 0 to 116 and output the character 't'.\n9. `-----`: Decrement cell 0 by 5, resulting in 111.\n10. `.`: Output the character 'o'.\n11. `-`: Decrement cell 0 to 110.\n12. `.`: Output the character 'n'.\n13. `---------.`: Decrement cell 0 by 9, resulting in 101, and output the character 'e'.\n14. `<`: Move to cell 2 (which is 0, but this doesn't affect the output).\n\nThe output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\nTherefore, the final output of the program is:\n\n<<<stone>>>"
