    "To analyze the given Brainf*ck code, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initialization and Setup:**\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to the second cell.\n   - `[-]`: Set the second cell to 0 (in case it wasn't already).\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to the third cell.\n   - `[-]`: Set the third cell to 0.\n   - `<`: Move the pointer back to the second cell.\n\n2. **First Loop:**\n   - `>+++++++`: Increment the third cell by 7.\n   - `[<+++++++++++++++>-]`: This loop will run 7 times (since the third cell is 7). Each iteration:\n     - `<+++++++++++++++`: Increment the second cell by 15.\n     - `>`: Move back to the third cell.\n     - `-`: Decrement the third cell by 1.\n   - After the loop, the second cell will be 105 (7 * 15), and the third cell will be 0.\n\n3. **Output Characters:**\n   - `<`: Move to the second cell.\n   - `+.`: Increment the second cell to 106 and output 'j' (ASCII 106).\n   - `+++++.`: Increment the second cell to 111 and output 'o' (ASCII 111).\n   - `---.`: Decrement the second cell to 108 and output 'l' (ASCII 108).\n   - `.`: Output 'l' again (ASCII 108).\n   - `+++++++++++++.`: Increment the second cell to 121 and output 'y' (ASCII 121).\n   - `<`: Move to the first cell (which is 0).\n\nThe final output of the code is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\n**Output:**\njolly"
