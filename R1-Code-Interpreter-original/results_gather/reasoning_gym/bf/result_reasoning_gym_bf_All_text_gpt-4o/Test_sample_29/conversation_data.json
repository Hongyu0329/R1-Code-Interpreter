    "To analyze the Brainf*ck program, we need to understand how each command works:\n\n- `>`: Move the pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n- `[`: Jump past the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n\nLet's break down the program step by step:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to cell 1 and set it to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to cell 2 and set it to 0.\n3. `<`: Move back to cell 1.\n4. `>`: Move to cell 2.\n5. `+++++++++`: Set cell 2 to 9.\n6. `[<++++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply cell 2 by 12 and store in cell 1.\n   - Move to cell 1, add 12, move back to cell 2, decrement cell 2.\n   - Repeat until cell 2 is 0.\n   - Cell 1 now contains 108 (9 * 12).\n7. `<+.`: Move to cell 0, increment (set to 1), output (ASCII 1 is SOH, a non-printable character).\n8. `------------`: Decrement cell 0 by 12 (now -11, but in unsigned 8-bit, it's 245).\n9. `.`: Output cell 0 (ASCII 245 is a non-printable character).\n10. `++++++++++++`: Increment cell 0 by 12 (now 1).\n11. `.`: Output cell 0 (ASCII 1 is SOH, a non-printable character).\n12. `-----------`: Decrement cell 0 by 11 (now -10, but in unsigned 8-bit, it's 246).\n13. `.`: Output cell 0 (ASCII 246 is a non-printable character).\n14. `+++++++++++++`: Increment cell 0 by 13 (now 3).\n15. `.`: Output cell 0 (ASCII 3 is ETX, a non-printable character).\n16. `<`: Move to cell 1.\n\nThe program outputs a series of non-printable characters. Since these characters are not visible, the output is effectively empty when printed.\n\nTherefore, the output of the program is:\n\n<<<>>>"
