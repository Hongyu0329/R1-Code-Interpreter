    "To analyze the Brainf*ck program, we need to understand how each command works:\n\n- `>`: Move the pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n- `[`: Jump past the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n\nLet's break down the program step by step:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to cell 1 and set it to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to cell 2 and set it to 0.\n3. `<`: Move back to cell 1.\n4. `>+++++++`: Move to cell 2 and set it to 7.\n5. `[<+++++++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply cell 1 by 15 and store the result in cell 0.\n   - Move to cell 1, add 15 to cell 0, decrement cell 1, and repeat until cell 1 is 0.\n   - Cell 0 becomes 105 (7 * 15).\n6. `<.`: Move to cell 0 and output its value as a character ('i').\n7. `+++++.`: Increment cell 0 by 5 (making it 110) and output ('n').\n8. `-------.`: Decrement cell 0 by 7 (making it 103) and output ('g').\n9. `++++++++.`: Increment cell 0 by 8 (making it 111) and output ('o').\n10. `+++++.`: Increment cell 0 by 5 (making it 116) and output ('t').\n11. `<`: Move to cell 1 (which is 0).\n\nThe program outputs the characters corresponding to the ASCII values in sequence.\n\nThe final output of the program is:\n\n<<<ingot>>>"
