    "To analyze the given Brainfuck code, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initialization and Setup:**\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to cell 1.\n   - `[-]`: Set cell 1 to 0.\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to cell 2.\n   - `[-]`: Set cell 2 to 0.\n   - `<`: Move the pointer back to cell 1.\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to cell 2.\n\n2. **Setting Up Values:**\n   - `+++++++`: Increment cell 2 by 7.\n\n3. **Loop to Multiply:**\n   - `[<++++++++++++++>-]`: This loop will run 7 times (since cell 2 is 7), and each time it will:\n     - Move to cell 1 (`<`), add 14 (`++++++++++++++`), and move back to cell 2 (`>`).\n     - Decrement cell 2 by 1 (`-`).\n   - After the loop, cell 1 will have 98 (7 * 14), and cell 2 will be 0.\n\n4. **Output Characters:**\n   - `<`: Move to cell 1.\n   - `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in cell 1 (98, which is 'b').\n   - `++++++++++`: Increment cell 1 by 10 (98 + 10 = 108).\n   - `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in cell 1 (108, which is 'l').\n   - `+++`: Increment cell 1 by 3 (108 + 3 = 111).\n   - `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in cell 1 (111, which is 'o').\n   - `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in cell 1 (111, which is 'o').\n   - `--`: Decrement cell 1 by 2 (111 - 2 = 109).\n   - `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in cell 1 (109, which is 'm').\n   - `<`: Move to cell 0 (though this move is not necessary for output).\n\nThe final output of the code is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\n**Output:** bloom"
