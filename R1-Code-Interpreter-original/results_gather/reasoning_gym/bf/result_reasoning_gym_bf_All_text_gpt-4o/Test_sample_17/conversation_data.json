    "To analyze the given Brainf*ck code, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initialization and Setup:**\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to the second cell.\n   - `[-]`: Set the second cell to 0.\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to the third cell.\n   - `[-]`: Set the third cell to 0.\n   - `<`: Move the pointer back to the second cell.\n\n2. **First Loop:**\n   - `>+++++++++[<++++++++++++>-]`: This loop will initialize the third cell with a value.\n     - `>+++++++++`: Increment the third cell by 9.\n     - `[<++++++++++++>-]`: This loop will run 9 times, each time incrementing the second cell by 12 and decrementing the third cell by 1.\n     - After the loop, the second cell will have a value of 108 (9 * 12), and the third cell will be 0.\n\n3. **Output Characters:**\n   - `<+.`: Move to the second cell and output its value as a character. The ASCII value 108 corresponds to 'l'.\n   - `++.`: Increment the second cell by 2 (making it 110) and output it. The ASCII value 110 corresponds to 'n'.\n   - `+++++++.`: Increment the second cell by 7 (making it 117) and output it. The ASCII value 117 corresponds to 'u'.\n   - `-------------.`: Decrement the second cell by 13 (making it 104) and output it. The ASCII value 104 corresponds to 'h'.\n   - `----.`: Decrement the second cell by 4 (making it 100) and output it. The ASCII value 100 corresponds to 'd'.\n   - `<`: Move the pointer back to the first cell.\n\nThe final output of the code is the sequence of characters produced by the ASCII values: \"lnuhd\".\n\n**Output:**\nlnuhd"
