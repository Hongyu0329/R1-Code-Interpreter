    "To analyze the Brainf*ck program, we need to understand how each command works:\n\n- `>`: Move the pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the memory cell at the pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the memory cell at the pointer.\n- `[`: Jump past the matching `]` if the cell at the pointer is 0.\n- `]`: Jump back to the matching `[` if the cell at the pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the character at the memory cell at the pointer.\n\nLet's break down the program step by step:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to cell 1 and set it to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to cell 2 and set it to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move back to cell 1.\n4. `+++++++`: Increment cell 1 by 7.\n5. `[<++++++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply cell 1 by 14 and store in cell 0.\n   - Move to cell 0, add 14, move back to cell 1, decrement cell 1.\n   - Repeat until cell 1 is 0.\n   - Result: cell 0 = 98 (7 * 14).\n6. `<.`: Move to cell 0 and output its value as a character ('b').\n7. `+++++++.`: Increment cell 0 by 7 (98 + 7 = 105) and output ('i').\n8. `-----..`: Decrement cell 0 by 5 (105 - 5 = 100) and output twice ('dd').\n9. `>+++[<+++++++>-]<`: Move to cell 1, increment by 3, loop to multiply by 7 and store in cell 0.\n   - Move to cell 0, add 7, move back to cell 1, decrement cell 1.\n   - Repeat until cell 1 is 0.\n   - Result: cell 0 = 21 (3 * 7).\n10. `.<`: Move to cell 0 and output its value as a character ('\\x15', a non-printable character).\n\nThe output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\nThe final output of the program is:\n\n<<<bidd\\x15>>>"
