    "To analyze the given Brainf*ck program, we need to understand how each command works and how they manipulate the memory tape. Brainf*ck uses a memory tape with cells initialized to zero, and a data pointer that starts at the first cell. The commands are:\n\n- `>`: Move the data pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the data pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n- `[`: Jump forward to the command after the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the command after the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n\nLet's break down the program step by step:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the second cell and set it to zero.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the third cell and set it to zero.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the second cell.\n4. `++++++++`: Increment the second cell to 8.\n5. `[<++++++++++++++>-]`: This loop will run 8 times (since the second cell is 8), and each time it will:\n   - Move to the first cell, add 14 to it, and move back to the second cell.\n   - Decrement the second cell by 1.\n   After the loop, the first cell will be 112 (8 * 14) and the second cell will be 0.\n6. `<.-`: Move to the first cell, output its value (112, which is 'p'), and decrement it to 111.\n7. `---`: Decrement the first cell by 3, making it 108.\n8. `.`: Output the value of the first cell (108, which is 'l').\n9. `+++++++++++++`: Increment the first cell by 13, making it 121.\n10. `.`: Output the value of the first cell (121, which is 'y').\n11. `---------.`: Decrement the first cell by 9, making it 112, and output it (112, which is 'p').\n12. `<`: Move to the second cell, which is 0.\n\nThe output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\nThe final output of the program is:\n\n<<<plyp>>>"
