    "To analyze the Brainf*ck program, we need to understand how each command works:\n\n- `>`: Move the pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n- `[`: Jump past the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n\nLet's break down the program step by step:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to cell 1 and set it to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to cell 2 and set it to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move back to cell 1.\n4. `+++++++++[<++++++++++++>-]`: \n   - Set cell 1 to 9.\n   - Loop: \n     - Move to cell 0, add 12 (9 times), resulting in 108 in cell 0.\n     - Decrement cell 1 until it reaches 0.\n5. `<+.`: \n   - Move to cell 0, increment to 109, and output 'm'.\n6. `------------`: \n   - Decrement cell 0 by 12, resulting in 97.\n7. `.`: \n   - Output 'a'.\n8. `+++++++++++++.`: \n   - Increment cell 0 by 13, resulting in 110.\n   - Output 'n'.\n9. `-----.`: \n   - Decrement cell 0 by 5, resulting in 105.\n   - Output 'i'.\n10. `--------.`: \n    - Decrement cell 0 by 8, resulting in 97.\n    - Output 'a'.\n11. `<`: \n    - Move to cell 2 (which is 0).\n\nThe output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\nTherefore, the final output of the program is:\n\n<<<mania>>>"
