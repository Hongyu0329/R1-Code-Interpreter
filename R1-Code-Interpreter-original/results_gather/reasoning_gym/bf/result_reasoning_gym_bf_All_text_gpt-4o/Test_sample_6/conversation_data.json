    "To analyze the given Brainf*ck code, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initialization and Setup:**\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to the second cell.\n   - `[-]`: Set the second cell to 0.\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to the third cell.\n   - `[-]`: Set the third cell to 0.\n   - `<`: Move the pointer back to the second cell.\n\n2. **First Character:**\n   - `>+++++++++[<+++++++++++>-]<`: \n     - Move to the third cell and add 9 to it.\n     - Loop: While the third cell is not zero, do the following:\n       - Move to the second cell and add 11 to it.\n       - Move back to the third cell and decrement it.\n     - This loop runs 9 times, so the second cell ends up with 99 (9 * 11).\n   - `.`: Output the character corresponding to ASCII 99, which is 'c'.\n\n3. **Second Character:**\n   - `+++++`: Add 5 to the second cell, making it 104.\n   - `.`: Output the character corresponding to ASCII 104, which is 'h'.\n\n4. **Third Character:**\n   - `-------`: Subtract 7 from the second cell, making it 97.\n   - `.`: Output the character corresponding to ASCII 97, which is 'a'.\n\n5. **Fourth Character:**\n   - `>+++[<++++++>-]<`: \n     - Move to the third cell and add 3 to it.\n     - Loop: While the third cell is not zero, do the following:\n       - Move to the second cell and add 6 to it.\n       - Move back to the third cell and decrement it.\n     - This loop runs 3 times, so the second cell ends up with 115 (97 + 18).\n   - `.`: Output the character corresponding to ASCII 115, which is 's'.\n\n6. **Fifth Character:**\n   - `------`: Subtract 6 from the second cell, making it 109.\n   - `.`: Output the character corresponding to ASCII 109, which is 'm'.\n\n7. **Final Step:**\n   - `<`: Move the pointer back to the first cell (though this doesn't affect the output).\n\nBy following these steps, the output of the Brainf*ck code is:\n\n```\nchasm\n```"
