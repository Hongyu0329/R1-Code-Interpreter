    "To analyze the Brainf*ck program, we need to understand how each command works:\n\n- `>`: Move the pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n- `[`: Jump past the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n\nLet's break down the program step by step:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to cell 1 and set it to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to cell 2 and set it to 0.\n3. `<`: Move back to cell 1.\n4. `>`: Move to cell 2.\n5. `+++++++++`: Set cell 2 to 9.\n6. `[<+++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply cell 2 by 11 and store in cell 1.\n   - Cell 2 starts at 9.\n   - Move to cell 1, add 11, move back to cell 2, decrement.\n   - Repeat until cell 2 is 0.\n   - Cell 1 ends up with 99 (9 * 11).\n7. `<`: Move to cell 1.\n8. `.`: Output the character corresponding to 99, which is 'c'.\n9. `+++++`: Increment cell 1 by 5 (99 + 5 = 104).\n10. `.`: Output the character corresponding to 104, which is 'h'.\n11. `+++++++`: Increment cell 1 by 7 (104 + 7 = 111).\n12. `.`: Output the character corresponding to 111, which is 'o'.\n13. `------`: Decrement cell 1 by 6 (111 - 6 = 105).\n14. `.`: Output the character corresponding to 105, which is 'i'.\n15. `+++++++++`: Increment cell 1 by 9 (105 + 9 = 114).\n16. `.`: Output the character corresponding to 114, which is 'r'.\n17. `<`: Move to cell 0.\n18. `.`: Output the character corresponding to 0, which is a null character (not visible).\n\nThe visible output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\nTherefore, the output of the program is:\n\n<<<choir>>>"
