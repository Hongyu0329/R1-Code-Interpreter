    "To analyze the Brainf*ck program, we need to understand how each command works:\n\n- `>`: Move the pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the memory cell at the pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the memory cell at the pointer.\n- `[`: Jump past the matching `]` if the cell at the pointer is 0.\n- `]`: Jump back to the matching `[` if the cell at the pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the character at the memory cell at the pointer.\n\nLet's break down the program step by step:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to cell 1 and set it to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to cell 2 and set it to 0.\n3. `<`: Move back to cell 1.\n4. `>++++++++++`: Move to cell 2 and set it to 10.\n5. `[<+++++++++++>-]`: Loop until cell 2 is 0, adding 11 to cell 1 each time. This loop runs 10 times, so cell 1 becomes 110.\n6. `<+`: Move to cell 0 and increment it by 1, so cell 0 becomes 1.\n7. `.`: Output the character at cell 0, which is ASCII 1 (non-printable, often represented as a smiley face or similar).\n8. `-`: Decrement cell 0 to 0.\n9. `.`: Output the character at cell 0, which is ASCII 0 (non-printable, often represented as a null character).\n10. `+++++`: Increment cell 0 to 5.\n11. `.`: Output the character at cell 0, which is ASCII 5 (non-printable, often represented as an ENQ or similar).\n12. `--------------`: Decrement cell 0 to -8 (or 248 in unsigned 8-bit, which is ASCII 248, often represented as an \"ø\" or similar).\n13. `.`: Output the character at cell 0, which is ASCII 248.\n14. `+++++++++++++++`: Increment cell 0 to 7.\n15. `.`: Output the character at cell 0, which is ASCII 7 (non-printable, often represented as a bell or similar).\n16. `<`: Move back to cell 1.\n\nThe program outputs a series of non-printable characters and one printable character. The exact output depends on how the environment interprets non-printable ASCII values.\n\nThe final output of the program is:\n\n<<<\u0001\u0000\u0005ø\u0007>>>"
