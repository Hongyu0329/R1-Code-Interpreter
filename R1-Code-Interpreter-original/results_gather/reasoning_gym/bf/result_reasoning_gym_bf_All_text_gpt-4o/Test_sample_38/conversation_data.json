    "To analyze the given Brainf*ck code, we need to understand how each command manipulates the memory tape and the pointer. Brainf*ck operates on an array of memory cells, each initially set to zero, and a data pointer that starts at the first cell. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:\n\n1. `>`: Move the pointer to the right (to cell 1).\n2. `[-]`: Set the current cell (cell 1) to zero.\n3. `>`: Move the pointer to the right (to cell 2).\n4. `[-]`: Set the current cell (cell 2) to zero.\n5. `<`: Move the pointer to the left (to cell 1).\n6. `>`: Move the pointer to the right (to cell 2).\n7. `++++++++`: Increment the current cell (cell 2) by 8.\n8. `[<++++++++++++>-]`: This loop will run 8 times (since cell 2 is 8), and each time it will:\n   - Move left to cell 1.\n   - Increment cell 1 by 12.\n   - Move right to cell 2.\n   - Decrement cell 2 by 1.\n   After the loop, cell 1 will be 96 (8 * 12) and cell 2 will be 0.\n9. `<`: Move the pointer to the left (to cell 1).\n10. `+`: Increment the current cell (cell 1) by 1, making it 97.\n11. `.`: Output the character represented by the ASCII value in cell 1, which is 'a'.\n12. `+++`: Increment the current cell (cell 1) by 3, making it 100.\n13. `.`: Output the character represented by the ASCII value in cell 1, which is 'd'.\n14. `+++++++++`: Increment the current cell (cell 1) by 9, making it 109.\n15. `.`: Output the character represented by the ASCII value in cell 1, which is 'm'.\n16. `----`: Decrement the current cell (cell 1) by 4, making it 105.\n17. `.`: Output the character represented by the ASCII value in cell 1, which is 'i'.\n18. `+++++++++++`: Increment the current cell (cell 1) by 11, making it 116.\n19. `.`: Output the character represented by the ASCII value in cell 1, which is 't'.\n20. `<`: Move the pointer to the left (to cell 0).\n\nThe final output of the code is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\nThe exact output of the code is: `admit`"
