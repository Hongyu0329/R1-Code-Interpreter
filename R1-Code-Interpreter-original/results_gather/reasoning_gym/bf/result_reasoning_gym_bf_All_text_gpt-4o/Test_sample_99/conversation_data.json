    "To analyze the given Brainf*ck code, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initialization and Setup:**\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to cell 1.\n   - `[-]`: Set cell 1 to 0 (clears the cell).\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to cell 2.\n   - `[-]`: Set cell 2 to 0 (clears the cell).\n   - `<`: Move the pointer back to cell 1.\n\n2. **First Loop:**\n   - `>++++++++`: Increment cell 1 by 8.\n   - `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: This loop will run 8 times (since cell 1 is 8). Each iteration:\n     - `<+++++++++++++`: Increment cell 0 by 13.\n     - `>`: Move back to cell 1.\n     - `-`: Decrement cell 1 by 1.\n   - After the loop, cell 0 will be 104 (8 * 13) and cell 1 will be 0.\n\n3. **Output and Further Operations:**\n   - `<`: Move to cell 0.\n   - `-.`: Output the ASCII character for cell 0 (104), which is 'h', and then decrement cell 0 by 1 (now 103).\n   - `------`: Decrement cell 0 by 6 (now 97).\n   - `.`: Output the ASCII character for cell 0 (97), which is 'a'.\n   - `+++++`: Increment cell 0 by 5 (now 102).\n   - `.`: Output the ASCII character for cell 0 (102), which is 'f'.\n   - `.`: Output the ASCII character for cell 0 (102), which is 'f' again.\n   - `-.`: Output the ASCII character for cell 0 (101), which is 'e', and then decrement cell 0 by 1 (now 100).\n   - `<`: Move to cell 1 (though this has no further effect on output).\n\nThe final output of the code is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\n**Output:** haffe"
