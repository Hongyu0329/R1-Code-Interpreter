    "To analyze the given Brainfuck program, we need to understand how each command manipulates the memory tape and the data pointer. Brainfuck uses a memory tape with cells initialized to zero, and a data pointer that starts at the first cell. The commands are:\n\n- `>`: Move the data pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the data pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n- `[`: Jump forward to the command after the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the command after the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n\nLet's break down the program step by step:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the second cell and set it to zero.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the third cell and set it to zero.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the second cell.\n4. `+++++++++`: Increment the second cell to 9.\n5. `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: This loop will run 9 times (since the second cell is 9), and each time it will:\n   - Move to the first cell, increment it by 13, and move back to the second cell.\n   - Decrement the second cell by 1.\n   After the loop, the first cell will be 117 (9 * 13) and the second cell will be 0.\n6. `<+.`: Move to the first cell, increment it by 1 (making it 118), and output it as a character ('v').\n7. `-------.`: Decrement the first cell by 7 (making it 111) and output it as a character ('o').\n8. `-----------.`: Decrement the first cell by 11 (making it 100) and output it as a character ('d').\n9. `+++++++.`: Increment the first cell by 7 (making it 107) and output it as a character ('k').\n10. `----------.`: Decrement the first cell by 10 (making it 97) and output it as a character ('a').\n11. `<`: Move to the second cell (which is 0).\n\nThe output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\nThe final output of the program is: <<<vodka>>>."
