    "To analyze the given Brainfuck code, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initialization and Setup:**\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to cell 1.\n   - `[-]`: Set cell 1 to 0.\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to cell 2.\n   - `[-]`: Set cell 2 to 0.\n   - `<`: Move the pointer back to cell 1.\n   - `>`: Move the pointer to cell 2.\n\n2. **First Loop:**\n   - `++++++++`: Increment cell 2 by 8.\n   - `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: This loop will run 8 times (since cell 2 is 8), and for each iteration:\n     - `<`: Move to cell 1.\n     - `+++++++++++++`: Increment cell 1 by 13.\n     - `>`: Move back to cell 2.\n     - `-`: Decrement cell 2 by 1.\n   - After the loop, cell 1 will be 104 (8 * 13) and cell 2 will be 0.\n\n3. **Output Characters:**\n   - `<`: Move to cell 1.\n   - `.`: Output the ASCII character for the value in cell 1, which is 104 ('h').\n\n4. **Second Character:**\n   - `+++++++++++++`: Increment cell 1 by 13, making it 117.\n   - `.`: Output the ASCII character for the value in cell 1, which is 117 ('u').\n\n5. **Third Character:**\n   - `--------`: Decrement cell 1 by 8, making it 109.\n   - `.`: Output the ASCII character for the value in cell 1, which is 109 ('m').\n\n6. **Fourth Character:**\n   - `------------`: Decrement cell 1 by 12, making it 97.\n   - `.`: Output the ASCII character for the value in cell 1, which is 97 ('a').\n\n7. **Fifth Character:**\n   - `+++++++++++++`: Increment cell 1 by 13, making it 110.\n   - `.`: Output the ASCII character for the value in cell 1, which is 110 ('n').\n\n8. **Final Step:**\n   - `<`: Move to cell 0 (though this move is not necessary for output).\n\nThe final output of the Brainfuck code is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\n**Output:**\nhuman"
