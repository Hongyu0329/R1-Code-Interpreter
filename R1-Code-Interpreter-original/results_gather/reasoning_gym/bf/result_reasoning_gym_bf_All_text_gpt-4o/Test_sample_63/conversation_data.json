    "To analyze the given Brainfuck program, we need to understand how each command affects the memory tape and the pointer. Brainfuck operates on an array of memory cells, each initially set to zero, and a data pointer that starts at the first cell. The commands are:\n\n- `>`: Move the data pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the data pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n- `[`: Jump forward to the command after the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the command after the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n\nLet's break down the program step by step:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to cell 1 and set it to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to cell 2 and set it to 0.\n3. `<`: Move back to cell 1.\n4. `>+++++++++[<++++++++++++>-]`: \n   - Move to cell 2.\n   - Set cell 2 to 9 (`+++++++++`).\n   - Start a loop that will run 9 times (since cell 2 is 9).\n     - Move to cell 1.\n     - Add 12 to cell 1 (`<++++++++++++>`).\n     - Move back to cell 2.\n     - Decrement cell 2 (`-`).\n   - After the loop, cell 1 will be 108 (9 * 12) and cell 2 will be 0.\n5. `<-.`: \n   - Move to cell 1.\n   - Decrement cell 1 to 107.\n   - Output the character 'k' (ASCII 107).\n6. `+++.+.++++++++.---------.`: \n   - Increment cell 1 to 110.\n   - Output the character 'n' (ASCII 110).\n   - Increment cell 1 to 111.\n   - Output the character 'o' (ASCII 111).\n   - Increment cell 1 to 119.\n   - Output the character 'w' (ASCII 119).\n   - Decrement cell 1 to 114.\n   - Output the character 'r' (ASCII 114).\n7. `<`: Move to cell 0 (not used further).\n\nThe output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\nThe final output of the program is: <<<knowr>>>."
