    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck program, we need to analyze it step by step. Brainf*ck operates on an array of memory cells, each initially set to zero, and a data pointer that starts at the first cell. The commands are:\n\n- `>`: Increment the data pointer.\n- `<`: Decrement the data pointer.\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n- `[`: Jump forward to the command after the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the command after the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n- `,`: Input a byte and store it in the byte at the data pointer (not used in this program).\n\nLet's break down the program:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the second cell and set it to zero.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the third cell and set it to zero.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the second cell.\n4. `+++++++`: Increment the second cell to 7.\n5. `[<++++++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply the value in the second cell by 14 and store it in the first cell. This results in the first cell being 98 (7 * 14).\n6. `<.`: Move to the first cell and output its value as a character ('b').\n7. `>++++[<++++>-]`: Move to the second cell, increment it to 4, and multiply by 4 to store 16 in the third cell.\n8. `<.`: Move to the second cell and output its value as a character ('@').\n9. `>++++[<---->-]`: Move to the third cell, increment it to 4, and multiply by -4 to store 0 in the fourth cell.\n10. `<-.`: Move to the third cell, decrement it to 15, and output its value as a character ('?').\n11. `>+++[<+++++++>-]`: Move to the fourth cell, increment it to 3, and multiply by 7 to store 21 in the fifth cell.\n12. `<.`: Move to the fourth cell and output its value as a character ('U').\n13. `>++++[<---->-]`: Move to the fifth cell, increment it to 4, and multiply by -4 to store 0 in the sixth cell.\n14. `<-.`: Move to the fifth cell, decrement it to 20, and output its value as a character ('T').\n15. `<`: Move back to the fourth cell.\n\nThe output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands. Therefore, the final output is:\n\n<<<b@?UT>>>"
