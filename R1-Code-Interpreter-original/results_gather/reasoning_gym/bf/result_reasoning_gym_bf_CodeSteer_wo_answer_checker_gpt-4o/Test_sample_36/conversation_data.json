    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck program, we need to simulate the execution of the code step by step. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a pointer to manipulate data. Here's a breakdown of the program:\n\n1. `>[-]` - Move the pointer to the right and set the cell to 0.\n2. `>[-]` - Move the pointer to the right again and set the cell to 0.\n3. `<` - Move the pointer back to the left.\n4. `>+++++++++[<+++++++++++++>-]` - This loop initializes the current cell to 80. It does this by adding 8 to the cell and then multiplying it by 10 (8 * 10 = 80).\n5. `<--` - Move the pointer to the left and decrement the cell by 2, resulting in 78.\n6. `.` - Output the ASCII character corresponding to the value 78, which is 'N'.\n7. `+.` - Increment the cell to 79 and output the ASCII character, which is 'O'.\n8. `-----` - Decrement the cell by 5, resulting in 74.\n9. `.` - Output the ASCII character corresponding to the value 74, which is 'J'.\n10. `-` - Decrement the cell by 1, resulting in 73.\n11. `.` - Output the ASCII character corresponding to the value 73, which is 'I'.\n12. `---------.` - Decrement the cell by 9, resulting in 64, and output the ASCII character, which is '@'.\n13. `<` - Move the pointer to the left (though this doesn't affect the output).\n\nThe output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\nTherefore, the output of the program is:\n\n<<<NOJI@>>>"
