    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck program, we need to simulate the execution of the code step by step. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a data pointer to manipulate data. Here's a breakdown of the program:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move the data pointer to the right and set the cell to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move the data pointer to the right again and set the cell to 0.\n3. `<`: Move the data pointer to the left.\n4. `>+++++++++[<+++++++++++++>-]`: This loop initializes the current cell to 120. It does this by adding 8 to the cell, then using a loop to add 120 (8 * 15) to the cell.\n5. `<--`: Move the data pointer to the left and decrement the cell twice, setting it to 118.\n6. `.`: Output the ASCII character corresponding to the value 118, which is 'v'.\n7. `--------`: Decrement the cell by 8, setting it to 110.\n8. `.`: Output the ASCII character corresponding to the value 110, which is 'n'.\n9. `--`: Decrement the cell by 2, setting it to 108.\n10. `.`: Output the ASCII character corresponding to the value 108, which is 'l'.\n11. `----`: Decrement the cell by 4, setting it to 104.\n12. `.`: Output the ASCII character corresponding to the value 104, which is 'h'.\n13. `+++++++++++++`: Increment the cell by 13, setting it to 117.\n14. `.`: Output the ASCII character corresponding to the value 117, which is 'u'.\n15. `<`: Move the data pointer to the left.\n\nThe output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands. Therefore, the output is:\n\n<<<vnlhu>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
