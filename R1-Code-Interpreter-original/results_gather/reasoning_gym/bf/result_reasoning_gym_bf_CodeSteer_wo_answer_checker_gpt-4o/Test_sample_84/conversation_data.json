    "The given Brainf*ck code is a sequence of commands that manipulate a tape of memory cells, each initially set to zero. Let's break down the code step by step to understand what it does and determine the output:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the first cell.\n4. `+++++++++`: Increment the first cell to 9.\n5. `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: Loop that multiplies the value in the first cell by 13, resulting in 117 in the second cell.\n6. `<-.`: Move back to the first cell and output its value as a character (ASCII 8, which is backspace).\n7. `+.---.`: Increment the first cell to 9, output (ASCII 9, which is tab), decrement three times to 6, and output (ASCII 6, which is ACK).\n8. `>++++[<---->-]`: Move to the second cell, increment to 121, and subtract 4 four times, resulting in 97.\n9. `<.+++++++++++++.`: Move back to the first cell, output (ASCII 6, which is ACK), increment to 19, and output (ASCII 19, which is device control 3).\n\nThe output of the code is a sequence of ASCII characters corresponding to the values in the cells when they are output. The exact output is:\n\n```\n\b\t\u0006a\u0006\u0013\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider the following BF (Brainf*ck) code.
