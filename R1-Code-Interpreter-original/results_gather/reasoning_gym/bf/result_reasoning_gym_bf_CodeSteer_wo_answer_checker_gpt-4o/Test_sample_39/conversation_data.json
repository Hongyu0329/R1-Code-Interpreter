    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck program, we need to simulate its execution. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a pointer to manipulate data. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:\n\n1. `>[-]` - Move the pointer to the right and set the cell to 0.\n2. `>[-]` - Move the pointer to the right again and set the cell to 0.\n3. `<` - Move the pointer back to the left.\n4. `>++++++++++` - Move the pointer to the right and set the cell to 10.\n5. `[<++++++++++>-]` - Loop: Move left, add 10 to the cell, move right, subtract 1 from the cell, repeat until the cell is 0. This effectively sets the left cell to 100.\n6. `<.` - Move the pointer left and output the character corresponding to the ASCII value 100, which is 'd'.\n7. `++++++++++++++` - Add 14 to the current cell (100), making it 114.\n8. `.` - Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value 114, which is 'r'.\n9. `---` - Subtract 3 from the current cell (114), making it 111.\n10. `.` - Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value 111, which is 'o'.\n11. `.` - Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value 111 again, which is 'o'.\n12. `---` - Subtract 3 from the current cell (111), making it 108.\n13. `.` - Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value 108, which is 'l'.\n14. `<` - Move the pointer left.\n\nThe output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands. Therefore, the output is:\n\n<<<drool>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
