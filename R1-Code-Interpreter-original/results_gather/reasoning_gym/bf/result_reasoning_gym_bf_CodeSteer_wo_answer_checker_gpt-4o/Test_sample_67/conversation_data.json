    "The given Brainf*ck code is a sequence of commands that manipulate a tape of memory cells, each initially set to zero. Let's break down the code step by step to understand what it does and determine the output:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the first cell.\n4. `++++++++++`: Increment the first cell to 10.\n5. `[<+++++++++++>-]`: This loop will run 10 times (since the current cell is 10), and it will:\n   - Move left and increment the previous cell by 11.\n   - Move right and decrement the current cell by 1.\n   - The result is that the first cell becomes 0, and the second cell becomes 110 (10 * 11).\n6. `<+.`: Move to the first cell, increment it by 1 (making it 1), and output the character corresponding to ASCII value 1 (which is a non-printable character, so it won't be visible).\n7. `--.`: Decrement the first cell by 2 (making it -1, which wraps around to 255 in unsigned 8-bit), and output the character corresponding to ASCII value 255 (ÿ).\n8. `--------.`: Decrement the first cell by 8 (making it 247), and output the character corresponding to ASCII value 247 (÷).\n9. `++.`: Increment the first cell by 2 (making it 249), and output the character corresponding to ASCII value 249 (ù).\n10. `------.`: Decrement the first cell by 6 (making it 243), and output the character corresponding to ASCII value 243 (ó).\n11. `<`: Move to the second cell (which is 110).\n\nThe output of the code is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands. The visible characters are:\n\n```\nÿ÷ùó\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider the following BF (Brainf*ck) code.
