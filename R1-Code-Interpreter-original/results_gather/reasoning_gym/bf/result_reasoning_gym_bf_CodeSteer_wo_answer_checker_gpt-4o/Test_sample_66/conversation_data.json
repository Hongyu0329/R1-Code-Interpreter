    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck program, we need to simulate the execution of the code step by step. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a data pointer to manipulate data. Here's a breakdown of the program:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move the data pointer to the right and set the cell to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move the data pointer to the right again and set the cell to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move the data pointer left and then right, effectively staying in the same position.\n4. `++++++++++`: Increment the current cell (cell 2) by 10.\n5. `[<+++++++++++>-]`: This loop will run 10 times, each time:\n   - Move the data pointer left to cell 1.\n   - Increment cell 1 by 11.\n   - Move the data pointer right to cell 2.\n   - Decrement cell 2 by 1.\n   After the loop, cell 1 will have the value 110, and cell 2 will be 0.\n6. `<+.`: Move the data pointer left to cell 1 and output the character corresponding to the ASCII value 110 ('n').\n7. `---------------`: Decrement cell 1 by 15, resulting in 95.\n8. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value 95 ('_').\n9. `+++`: Increment cell 1 by 3, resulting in 98.\n10. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value 98 ('b').\n11. `++++++++++++++`: Increment cell 1 by 14, resulting in 112.\n12. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value 112 ('p').\n13. `--------------`: Decrement cell 1 by 14, resulting in 98.\n14. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value 98 ('b').\n15. `<`: Move the data pointer left to cell 0.\n\nThe output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands. Therefore, the output of the program is:\n\n<<<n_bp>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
