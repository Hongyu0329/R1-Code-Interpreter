    "The given Brainf*ck code is a sequence of commands that manipulate a tape of memory cells, each initially set to zero. Let's break down the code step by step to understand what it does and determine the output:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the first cell.\n4. `++++++++`: Increment the first cell by 8.\n5. `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: Loop that multiplies the value in the first cell by 13 and stores it in the second cell. This results in the second cell having a value of 104 (8 * 13).\n6. `<-.`: Move to the first cell and decrement it by 1, then output the ASCII character corresponding to the value in the first cell (7), which is a bell character (non-printable).\n7. `------`: Decrement the second cell by 6, resulting in a value of 98.\n8. `.`: Output the ASCII character corresponding to the value in the second cell, which is 'b'.\n9. `+++++`: Increment the second cell by 5, resulting in a value of 103.\n10. `.`: Output the ASCII character corresponding to the value in the second cell, which is 'g'.\n11. `.`: Output the ASCII character corresponding to the value in the second cell again, which is 'g'.\n12. `-.`: Decrement the second cell by 1, resulting in a value of 102, and output the ASCII character, which is 'f'.\n13. `<`: Move back to the first cell.\n\nThe output of the code is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands. Therefore, the exact output of the code is:\n\n```plaintext\nbggf\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider the following BF (Brainf*ck) code.
