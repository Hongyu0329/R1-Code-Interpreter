    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck program, we need to simulate the execution of the code step by step. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a pointer to manipulate data. Here's a breakdown of the program:\n\n1. `>[-]` and `>[-]`: These commands move the pointer to the right and set the cells to zero. The first two cells are set to zero.\n\n2. `<>`: Moves the pointer back to the first cell.\n\n3. `+++++++++[<+++++++++++++>-]`: This loop initializes the first cell to 120. It does this by adding 8 to the first cell, then moving to the second cell, adding 13, and looping back to the first cell until the second cell is zero.\n\n4. `<--`: Moves back to the first cell and decrements it twice, resulting in 118.\n\n5. `.`: Outputs the ASCII character corresponding to the value in the first cell, which is 'v'.\n\n6. `-----------`: Decrements the first cell by 11, resulting in 107.\n\n7. `.`: Outputs the ASCII character corresponding to the value in the first cell, which is 'k'.\n\n8. `-------`: Decrements the first cell by 7, resulting in 100.\n\n9. `.`: Outputs the ASCII character corresponding to the value in the first cell, which is 'd'.\n\n10. `+++++++++++.`: Increments the first cell by 10, resulting in 110, and outputs the ASCII character 'n'.\n\n11. `++++++++.`: Increments the first cell by 8, resulting in 118, and outputs the ASCII character 'v'.\n\n12. `<`: Moves the pointer back to the first cell, but this does not affect the output.\n\nThe final output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\nTherefore, the output of the program is:\n\n<<<vkdnv>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
