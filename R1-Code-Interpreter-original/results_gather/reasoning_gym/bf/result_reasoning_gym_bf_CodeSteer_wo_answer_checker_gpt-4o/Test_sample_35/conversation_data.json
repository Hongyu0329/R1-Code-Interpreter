    "The given Brainf*ck program is a sequence of commands that manipulate a memory tape, which consists of cells initialized to zero. Let's break down the program step by step to determine its output:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the first cell.\n4. `+++++++++`: Increment the first cell by 9.\n5. `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: Loop that multiplies the value in the first cell by 13 and stores it in the second cell. This results in the second cell having a value of 117 (9 * 13).\n6. `<--`: Move back to the first cell and decrement it twice, resulting in a value of 7.\n7. `.`: Output the ASCII character corresponding to the value in the first cell (7), which is a bell character (non-printable).\n8. `-----------`: Decrement the first cell by 11, resulting in a value of -4 (non-printable).\n9. `.`: Output the ASCII character corresponding to the value in the first cell (-4), which is non-printable.\n10. `-------`: Decrement the first cell by 7, resulting in a value of -11 (non-printable).\n11. `.`: Output the ASCII character corresponding to the value in the first cell (-11), which is non-printable.\n12. `++++++++++++`: Increment the first cell by 12, resulting in a value of 1 (non-printable).\n13. `.`: Output the ASCII character corresponding to the value in the first cell (1), which is non-printable.\n14. `--------`: Decrement the first cell by 8, resulting in a value of -7 (non-printable).\n15. `.`: Output the ASCII character corresponding to the value in the first cell (-7), which is non-printable.\n16. `<`: Move back to the second cell.\n17. `.`: Output the ASCII character corresponding to the value in the second cell (117), which is 'u'.\n\nThe only printable character in this sequence is 'u'. Therefore, the output of the program is:\n\n<<<u>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    This is a BF (Brainf*ck) computer program.
