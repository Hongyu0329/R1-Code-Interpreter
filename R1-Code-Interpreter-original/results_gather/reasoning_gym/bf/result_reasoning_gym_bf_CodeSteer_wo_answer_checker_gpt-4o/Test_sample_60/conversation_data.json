    "The given Brainf*ck code is a sequence of operations that manipulate a tape of memory cells, each initially set to zero. Let's break down the code step by step to understand what it does and determine the output:\n\n1. `>[-]` and `>[-]`: These two operations move the pointer to the right and set the next two cells to zero. Since all cells are initially zero, these operations have no effect.\n\n2. `<>`: Moves the pointer back to the first cell.\n\n3. `+++++++++[<+++++++++++>-]`: This loop increments the first cell to 81 (9 * 9) and then moves the pointer to the second cell.\n\n4. `<.`: Moves back to the first cell and outputs the character corresponding to the ASCII value 81, which is 'Q'.\n\n5. `+++++.`: Increments the first cell to 86 and outputs the character 'V'.\n\n6. `-------.`: Decrements the first cell to 79 and outputs the character 'O'.\n\n7. `>+++[<++++++>-]`: Moves to the second cell, increments it to 18 (3 * 6), and then moves back to the first cell.\n\n8. `<.`: Outputs the character corresponding to the ASCII value 79, which is 'O'.\n\n9. `------.`: Decrements the first cell to 73 and outputs the character 'I'.\n\n10. `<`: Moves back to the first cell.\n\nThe final output of the Brainf*ck code is the sequence of characters: \"QVOOI\"."

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider the following BF (Brainf*ck) code.
