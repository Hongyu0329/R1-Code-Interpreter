    "The given Brainf*ck code is a sequence of commands that manipulate a tape of memory cells, each initially set to zero. Let's break down the code step by step to understand what it does and determine the output:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the first cell.\n4. `++++++++++`: Increment the first cell by 10.\n5. `[<+++++++++++>-]`: This loop will run 10 times (since the first cell is 10), and it will increment the second cell by 13 each time, resulting in the second cell being 130.\n6. `<+.`: Move to the first cell, increment it by 1 (making it 11), and output the character corresponding to ASCII value 11 (which is a non-printable character).\n7. `+++++++++.`: Increment the first cell by 9 (making it 20) and output the character corresponding to ASCII value 20 (which is a non-printable character).\n8. `---------------.`: Decrement the first cell by 15 (making it 5) and output the character corresponding to ASCII value 5 (which is a non-printable character).\n9. `-----.`: Decrement the first cell by 5 (making it 0) and output the character corresponding to ASCII value 0 (which is a non-printable character).\n10. `+.<`: Increment the first cell by 1 (making it 1) and output the character corresponding to ASCII value 1 (which is a non-printable character).\n\nThe output of the code consists of non-printable ASCII characters, which are not visible or meaningful in a typical text output. Therefore, the exact output of the code is a sequence of non-printable characters."

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider the following BF (Brainf*ck) code.
