    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck program, we need to simulate the execution of the code step by step. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a data pointer to manipulate data. Here's a brief explanation of the commands used in Brainf*ck:\n\n- `>`: Move the data pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the data pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n- `[`: Jump forward to the command after the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the command after the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n\nLet's break down the program:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the second cell and clear it (set to 0).\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the third cell and clear it (set to 0).\n3. `<>`: Move back to the second cell.\n4. `+++++++++[<+++++++++++++>-]`: Set the second cell to 72 by incrementing it 9 times and using a loop to multiply by 9.\n5. `<+.`: Move to the first cell, increment it by 1, and output it (ASCII 72 is 'H').\n6. `>++++[<---->-]`: Move to the second cell, increment it by 4, and use a loop to subtract 4 from the third cell, resulting in 100.\n7. `<-.`: Move to the first cell, decrement it by 1, and output it (ASCII 101 is 'e').\n8. `+++++++++++++.+.`: Increment the first cell to 111 and output it twice (ASCII 108 is 'l').\n9. `--------------.<`: Decrement the first cell to 100, output it (ASCII 111 is 'o'), and move to the second cell.\n\nThe output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands. Therefore, the output is:\n\n<<<Hello>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant.
