    "The given Brainf*ck code is a sequence of operations that manipulate a tape of memory cells, each initially set to zero. Let's break down the code step by step to determine the output:\n\n1. `>[-]` and `>[-]`: These two operations move the pointer to the right and set the next two cells to zero. Since all cells are initially zero, these operations have no effect.\n\n2. `<>`: Moves the pointer right and then left, effectively keeping it in the same position.\n\n3. `+++++++++[<+++++++++++>-]`: This loop increases the value of the current cell to 90 (9 * 10) by incrementing it 9 times and then multiplying by 10.\n\n4. `<.`: Moves the pointer left and outputs the character corresponding to the ASCII value 90, which is 'Z'.\n\n5. `+++++.`: Increments the current cell by 5, making it 5, and outputs the character corresponding to ASCII value 5, which is a non-printable character (ENQ).\n\n6. `-------.`: Decrements the current cell by 7, making it -2, and outputs the character corresponding to ASCII value -2, which is also a non-printable character.\n\n7. `>+++[<++++++>-]`: Moves the pointer right, increments the cell by 3, and then multiplies by 6, resulting in 18.\n\n8. `<.`: Moves the pointer left and outputs the character corresponding to ASCII value 18, which is a non-printable character (DC2).\n\n9. `------.`: Decrements the current cell by 6, making it 12, and outputs the character corresponding to ASCII value 12, which is a non-printable character (FF).\n\n10. `<`: Moves the pointer left.\n\nThe output of the code consists of the characters corresponding to the ASCII values produced by the operations. The only printable character in the output is 'Z'. Therefore, the exact output of the code is:\n\n```\nZ\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider the following BF (Brainf*ck) code.
