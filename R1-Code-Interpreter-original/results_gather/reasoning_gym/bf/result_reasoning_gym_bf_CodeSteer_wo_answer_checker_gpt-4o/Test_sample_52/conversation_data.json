    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck program, we need to simulate its execution step by step. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a data pointer to manipulate data. Here's a breakdown of the program:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move the data pointer to the right and set the cell to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move the data pointer to the right again and set the cell to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move the data pointer left and then right, effectively staying in the same position.\n4. `++++++++`: Increment the current cell (cell 2) by 8.\n5. `[<++++++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply the value in cell 2 by 14 and store it in cell 1. This results in cell 1 having a value of 112 (8 * 14).\n6. `<.`: Move the data pointer to the left (cell 1) and output the character corresponding to the ASCII value 112, which is 'p'.\n7. `-----------`: Decrement the current cell (cell 1) by 11, resulting in a value of 101.\n8. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value 101, which is 'e'.\n9. `+++++++++`: Increment the current cell (cell 1) by 9, resulting in a value of 110.\n10. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value 110, which is 'n'.\n11. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value 110 again, which is 'n'.\n12. `---------.`: Decrement the current cell (cell 1) by 9, resulting in a value of 101, and output the character 'e'.\n13. `<`: Move the data pointer to the left (cell 0).\n\nThe output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\nTherefore, the output of the program is:\n\n<<<penne>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
