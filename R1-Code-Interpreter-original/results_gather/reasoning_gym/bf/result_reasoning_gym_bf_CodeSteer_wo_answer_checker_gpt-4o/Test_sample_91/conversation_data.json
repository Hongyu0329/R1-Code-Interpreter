    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck code, we need to simulate the execution of the code step by step. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a data pointer to manipulate data. Here's a breakdown of the code:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move the data pointer to the right and set the current cell to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move the data pointer to the right again and set the current cell to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move the data pointer left and then right, effectively staying in the same position.\n4. `++++++++`: Increment the current cell (cell 2) by 8.\n5. `[<++++++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply the value in cell 2 by 14 and store it in cell 1. This results in cell 1 having a value of 112.\n6. `<.-`: Move to cell 1, output its value as a character ('p'), and decrement it by 1.\n7. `------`: Decrement the current cell (cell 1) by 6, resulting in a value of 105, and output it as a character ('i').\n8. `+++++`: Increment the current cell (cell 1) by 5, resulting in a value of 110, and output it as a character ('n').\n9. `++++++`: Increment the current cell (cell 1) by 6, resulting in a value of 116, and output it as a character ('t').\n10. `.<`: Move to cell 0, output its value as a character (newline), and move back to cell 1.\n\nThe output of the code is the string \"pint\" followed by a newline."

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider the following BF (Brainf*ck) code.
