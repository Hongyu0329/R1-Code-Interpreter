    "The given Brainf*ck code is a sequence of operations that manipulate a tape of memory cells, each initially set to zero. Let's break down the code step by step to understand what it does:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the first cell.\n4. `++++++++`: Increment the first cell by 8.\n5. `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply the first cell's value by 13 and store it in the second cell. This results in the second cell having a value of 104 (8 * 13).\n6. `<.`: Move to the first cell and output its value as a character. The value is 0, so it outputs a null character (not visible).\n7. `+++++++++++++.`: Increment the first cell by 14 and output its value as a character. The value is 14, which corresponds to a non-printable character (not visible).\n8. `--------.`: Decrement the first cell by 8 and output its value as a character. The value is 6, which corresponds to a non-printable character (not visible).\n9. `------------.`: Decrement the first cell by 12 and output its value as a character. The value is -6, which is not a valid ASCII character (not visible).\n10. `+++++++++++++.`: Increment the first cell by 13 and output its value as a character. The value is 7, which corresponds to a non-printable character (not visible).\n11. `<`: Move to the second cell.\n12. `.`: Output the value of the second cell as a character. The value is 104, which corresponds to the character 'h'.\n\nThe only visible output from this code is the character 'h'. Therefore, the exact output of the code is:\n\n```\nh\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider the following BF (Brainf*ck) code.
