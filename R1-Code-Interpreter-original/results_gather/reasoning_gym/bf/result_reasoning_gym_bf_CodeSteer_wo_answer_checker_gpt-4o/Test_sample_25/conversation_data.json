    "The given Brainf*ck code is a sequence of operations that manipulate a tape of memory cells, each initially set to zero. Let's break down the code step by step to determine the output:\n\n1. `>[-]` and `>[-]`: These two operations move the pointer to the second and third cells and set them to zero. Since all cells are initially zero, these operations have no effect.\n\n2. `<>`: Moves the pointer back to the first cell.\n\n3. `+++++++++`: Increments the first cell to 9.\n\n4. `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: This loop multiplies the value in the first cell by 13 (9 * 13 = 117) and stores it in the second cell.\n\n5. `<+.`: Moves back to the first cell and outputs its value as a character ('\\t' or tab character).\n\n6. `-------------.`: Decreases the value in the second cell by 13 and outputs it as a character ('A').\n\n7. `+++++++++.`: Increases the value in the second cell by 9 and outputs it as a character ('I').\n\n8. `>++++[<---->-]<-.`: Moves to the third cell, sets it to 4, and then decreases it to 0, outputting the character ('!').\n\n9. `+++++++++++.<`: Increases the value in the third cell by 11 and outputs it as a character ('\\n' or newline character).\n\nThe final output of the Brainf*ck code is:\n\n```\n\tAI!\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider the following BF (Brainf*ck) code.
