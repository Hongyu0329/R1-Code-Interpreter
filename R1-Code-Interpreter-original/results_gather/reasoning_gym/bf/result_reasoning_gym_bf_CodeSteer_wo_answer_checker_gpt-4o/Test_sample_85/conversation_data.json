    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck program, we need to simulate the execution of the code step by step. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a data pointer to manipulate data. Here's a breakdown of the program:\n\n1. `>[-]` and `>[-]`: These commands move the data pointer to the right and set the cells to zero. The first two cells are set to zero.\n\n2. `<>`: Moves the data pointer back to the first cell.\n\n3. `++++++++`: Increments the value at the current cell (cell 0) by 8.\n\n4. `[<++++++++++++++>-]`: This loop multiplies the value in cell 0 by 14 and stores the result in cell 1. It does this by moving the value from cell 0 to cell 1, incrementing cell 1 by 14 each time, and decrementing cell 0 until it reaches zero.\n\n5. `<.-.---.+++++++++++++.---------.<`: This sequence of commands outputs characters based on the ASCII values stored in the cells:\n   - `.` outputs the character corresponding to the ASCII value in the current cell.\n   - `-` decrements the value in the current cell.\n   - `<` and `>` move the data pointer left and right, respectively.\n\nLet's simulate the program:\n\n- After `++++++++`, cell 0 has the value 8.\n- The loop `[<++++++++++++++>-]` transfers 8 * 14 = 112 to cell 1.\n- The pointer is at cell 1 with value 112.\n- `.-` outputs 'p' (ASCII 112) and decrements to 111.\n- `.` outputs 'o' (ASCII 111) and decrements to 108.\n- `---` decrements to 105.\n- `.` outputs 'i' (ASCII 105) and decrements to 104.\n- `+++++++++++++` increments to 117.\n- `.` outputs 'u' (ASCII 117) and decrements to 116.\n- `---------.` decrements to 108 and outputs 'l' (ASCII 108).\n\nThe final output is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\nTherefore, the output of the program is:\n\n<<<poiul>>>"
