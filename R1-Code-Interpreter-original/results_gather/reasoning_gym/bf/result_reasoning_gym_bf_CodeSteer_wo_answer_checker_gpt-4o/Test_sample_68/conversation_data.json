    "The given Brainf*ck code is a sequence of commands that manipulate a tape of memory cells, each initially set to zero. Let's break down the code step by step to understand what it does and determine the output:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the first cell.\n4. `+++++++++`: Increment the first cell to 9.\n5. `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: Loop that multiplies the value in the first cell by 13 and stores it in the second cell. The first cell is decremented to zero, and the second cell ends up with 117 (9 * 13).\n6. `<.`: Move to the first cell and output its value as a character (ASCII 0, which is a null character and not visible).\n7. `>++++[<---->-]<-`: Move to the second cell, add 4, and then perform a loop that subtracts 4 from the second cell until it reaches zero. This loop effectively subtracts 4 * 29 = 116 from the second cell, leaving it with 1.\n8. `..`: Output the second cell's value twice as characters (ASCII 1, which is a non-printable character).\n9. `+.`: Increment the second cell to 2 and output it as a character (ASCII 2, which is a non-printable character).\n10. `+++++++++++++.<`: Increment the second cell by 13 to 15 and output it as a character (ASCII 15, which is a non-printable character).\n\nThe output of the code consists of non-printable ASCII characters, specifically:\n\n- A null character (ASCII 0)\n- Two ASCII 1 characters\n- An ASCII 2 character\n- An ASCII 15 character\n\nSince these are non-printable characters, the exact output is not visible in a typical text display."

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider the following BF (Brainf*ck) code.
