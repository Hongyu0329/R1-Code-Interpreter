    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck program, we need to simulate the execution of the code step by step. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a data pointer to manipulate data. Here's a breakdown of the program:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move the data pointer to the right and set the current cell to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move the data pointer to the right again and set the current cell to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move the data pointer left and then right, effectively staying in the same position.\n4. `+++++++`: Increment the current cell (cell 2) by 7.\n5. `[<+++++++++++++++>-]`: This loop will run 7 times (since the current cell is 7), and each time it will:\n   - Move the data pointer left to cell 1.\n   - Increment cell 1 by 15.\n   - Move the data pointer right to cell 2.\n   - Decrement cell 2 by 1.\n   - The loop ends when cell 2 is 0.\n6. `<.`: Move the data pointer left to cell 1 and output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in cell 1.\n7. `+++++`: Increment the current cell (cell 1) by 5.\n8. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in cell 1.\n9. `++.+++++.-.<`: Increment the current cell by 2, output the character, increment by 5, output the character, decrement by 1, output the character, and move the data pointer left.\n\nLet's calculate the ASCII values:\n\n- After step 5, cell 1 will have the value 105 (7 * 15).\n- After step 6, output the character 'i' (ASCII 105).\n- After step 7, cell 1 will have the value 110.\n- After step 8, output the character 'n' (ASCII 110).\n- After step 9, increment to 112, output 'p', increment to 117, output 'u', decrement to 116, output 't'.\n\nThe final output of the program is:\n\n<<<input>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant.

Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
