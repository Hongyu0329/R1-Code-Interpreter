    "The given Brainf*ck code is a sequence of commands that manipulate a tape of memory cells, each initially set to zero. Let's break down the code step by step to determine the output:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the first cell.\n4. `++++++++`: Increment the first cell to 8.\n5. `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply the first cell by 13, resulting in 104 in the second cell.\n6. `<-.`: Move back to the first cell and output its value as a character (104 is 'h').\n7. `------.`: Decrement the first cell by 6 (resulting in 98) and output it as a character ('b').\n8. `>+++[<+++++++>-]`: Move to the second cell, increment it by 3, and multiply by 7, resulting in 21 in the third cell.\n9. `<.`: Move back to the second cell and output its value as a character (21 is a non-printable character, but it is not output here).\n10. `>++++[<---->-]`: Move to the third cell, increment it by 4, and multiply by -4, resulting in 0 in the fourth cell.\n11. `<-.`: Move back to the third cell and output its value as a character (0 is a non-printable character, but it is not output here).\n12. `+++++++.<`: Increment the third cell by 7 (resulting in 7) and output it as a character (7 is a non-printable character, but it is not output here).\n\nThe output of the code is the characters corresponding to the ASCII values 104 ('h') and 98 ('b').\n\nTherefore, the exact output of the code is:\n\n```\nhb\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider the following BF (Brainf*ck) code.
