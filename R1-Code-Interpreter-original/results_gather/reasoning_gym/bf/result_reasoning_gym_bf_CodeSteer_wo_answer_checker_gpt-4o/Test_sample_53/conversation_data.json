    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck program, we need to simulate the execution of the code step by step. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a data pointer to manipulate data. Here's a brief explanation of the commands used in Brainf*ck:\n\n- `>`: Move the data pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the data pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n- `[`: Jump forward to the command after the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the command after the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n\nLet's break down the program:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the second cell and set it to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the third cell and set it to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the first cell.\n4. `+++++++++[<+++++++++++++>-]`: This loop sets the first cell to 72 (8 * 9).\n5. `<+.`: Output the first cell as a character ('H').\n6. `>++++[<---->-]`: This loop sets the second cell to 101 (4 * 25 + 1).\n7. `<-.`: Output the second cell as a character ('e').\n8. `+++++++++++++.`: Increment the second cell to 108 and output it as a character ('l').\n9. `++++.`: Increment the second cell to 111 and output it as a character ('o').\n10. `>++++[<---->-]`: This loop sets the third cell to 32 (4 * 8).\n11. `<-.`: Output the third cell as a character (' ').\n12. `<`: Move back to the second cell.\n\nThe output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\nThe final output of the program is:\n\n<<<Hello>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    This is a BF (Brainf*ck) computer program.
