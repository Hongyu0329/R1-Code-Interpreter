    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck program, we need to simulate the execution of the code step by step. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a pointer to manipulate data. Here's a breakdown of the program:\n\n1. `>[-]` - Move the pointer to the right and set the cell to 0.\n2. `>[-]` - Move the pointer to the right again and set the cell to 0.\n3. `<` - Move the pointer back to the left.\n4. `>` - Move the pointer to the right.\n5. `+++++++++` - Increment the current cell (cell 1) by 9.\n6. `[<+++++++++++++>-]` - Loop: Move left, increment by 13, move right, decrement. This loop runs 9 times, effectively setting cell 0 to 117 (9 * 13).\n7. `<` - Move the pointer to the left (back to cell 0).\n8. `--` - Decrement the current cell (cell 0) by 2, resulting in 115.\n9. `.` - Output the ASCII character for the value in cell 0, which is 's'.\n10. `--------` - Decrement the current cell (cell 0) by 8, resulting in 107.\n11. `.` - Output the ASCII character for the value in cell 0, which is 'k'.\n12. `++++++++++` - Increment the current cell (cell 0) by 10, resulting in 117.\n13. `.` - Output the ASCII character for the value in cell 0, which is 'u'.\n14. `---------` - Decrement the current cell (cell 0) by 9, resulting in 108.\n15. `.` - Output the ASCII character for the value in cell 0, which is 'l'.\n16. `..` - Output the ASCII character for the value in cell 0 twice, which is 'll'.\n\nPutting it all together, the output of the program is:\n\n<<<skull>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    This is a BF (Brainf*ck) computer program.
