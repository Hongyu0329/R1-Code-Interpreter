    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck program, we need to simulate the execution of the code step by step. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a data pointer to manipulate data. Here's a breakdown of the program:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move the data pointer to the right and set the current cell to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move the data pointer to the right again and set the current cell to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move the data pointer left and then right, effectively staying in the same position.\n4. `+++++++++[<+++++++++++++>-]`: This loop initializes the current cell to 72. It does this by adding 8 to the cell 9 times (8 * 9 = 72).\n5. `<+.`: Move the data pointer left and output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in the current cell (72, which is 'H').\n6. `-------.`: Subtract 7 from the current cell (72 - 7 = 65) and output the character (65, which is 'A').\n7. `-----------.`: Subtract 11 from the current cell (65 - 11 = 54) and output the character (54, which is '6').\n8. `+++++++.`: Add 7 to the current cell (54 + 7 = 61) and output the character (61, which is '=').\n9. `----------.`: Subtract 10 from the current cell (61 - 10 = 51) and output the character (51, which is '3').\n10. `<`: Move the data pointer left.\n\nThe output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands. Let's put it all together:\n\n- 'H' (72)\n- 'A' (65)\n- '6' (54)\n- '=' (61)\n- '3' (51)\n\nTherefore, the output of the program is:\n\n<<<HA6=3>>>"
