    "The given Brainf*ck code is a sequence of commands that manipulate a tape of memory cells, each initially set to zero. Let's break down the code step by step to understand what it does and determine the output:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the first cell.\n4. `+++++++++`: Increment the first cell by 9.\n5. `[<++++++++++++>-]`: Loop that multiplies the value in the first cell by 12 and stores it in the second cell. This results in the second cell having a value of 108 (9 * 12).\n6. `<+.`: Move to the first cell, increment it by 1 (making it 1), and output it as a character. This outputs the ASCII character with code 1, which is a non-printable character.\n7. `++.`: Increment the first cell by 2 (making it 3) and output it as a character. This outputs the ASCII character with code 3, which is a non-printable character.\n8. `++++..`: Increment the first cell by 4 (making it 7) and output it twice as a character. This outputs the ASCII character with code 7, which is a non-printable character, twice.\n9. `++++++.`: Increment the first cell by 6 (making it 13) and output it as a character. This outputs the ASCII character with code 13, which is a carriage return.\n10. `<`: Move back to the second cell.\n11. `.`: Output the value of the second cell as a character. This outputs the ASCII character with code 108, which is 'l'.\n\nThe output of the code consists of several non-printable characters followed by the letter 'l'. The exact output is:\n\n```\n<non-printable characters>l\n```\n\nSince the non-printable characters are not visible, the visible output is just:\n\n```\nl\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider the following BF (Brainf*ck) code.
