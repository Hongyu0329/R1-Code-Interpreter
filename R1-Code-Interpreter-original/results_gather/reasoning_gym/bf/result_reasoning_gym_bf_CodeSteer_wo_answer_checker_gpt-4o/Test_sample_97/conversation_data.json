    "The given Brainf*ck code is a sequence of commands that manipulate a tape of memory cells, each initially set to zero. Let's break down the code step by step to understand what it does and determine the output:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the first cell.\n4. `+++++++++`: Increment the first cell by 9.\n5. `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply the value in the first cell by 13, resulting in 117 in the second cell.\n6. `<--`: Move back to the first cell and decrement it twice, resulting in 7.\n7. `.`: Output the ASCII character corresponding to 7, which is a non-printable character (bell).\n8. `-----------`: Decrement the first cell by 11, resulting in -4 (or 252 in unsigned 8-bit).\n9. `.`: Output the ASCII character corresponding to 252, which is 'ü'.\n10. `+++++++`: Increment the first cell by 7, resulting in 3.\n11. `.`: Output the ASCII character corresponding to 3, which is a non-printable character (end of text).\n12. `+++`: Increment the first cell by 3, resulting in 6.\n13. `.`: Output the ASCII character corresponding to 6, which is a non-printable character (acknowledge).\n14. `----`: Decrement the first cell by 4, resulting in 2.\n15. `.`: Output the ASCII character corresponding to 2, which is a non-printable character (start of text).\n16. `<`: Move back to the second cell.\n17. `.`: Output the ASCII character corresponding to 117, which is 'u'.\n\nThe output of the code is a sequence of characters, some of which are non-printable. The printable part of the output is:\n\n```\nüu\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider the following BF (Brainf*ck) code.
