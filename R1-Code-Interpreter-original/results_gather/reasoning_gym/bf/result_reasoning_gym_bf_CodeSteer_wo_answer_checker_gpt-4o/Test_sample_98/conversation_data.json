    "The given Brainf*ck code is a sequence of operations that manipulate a tape of memory cells, each initially set to zero. Let's break down the code step by step to understand what it does:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the first cell.\n4. `++++++++`: Increment the first cell by 8.\n5. `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: This loop multiplies the value in the first cell by 13 and stores it in the second cell. The first cell is decremented to zero, and the second cell ends up with 104 (8 * 13).\n6. `<.`: Move back to the first cell and output its value as a character. Since the first cell is zero, this outputs a null character, which is typically not visible.\n7. `+++++++++++++.`: Increment the first cell by 14 and output its value as a character. This outputs the character 'N' (ASCII 78).\n8. `---..`: Decrement the first cell by 3 and output its value twice as a character. This outputs the character 'K' (ASCII 75) twice.\n9. `+++++++.<`: Increment the first cell by 7 and output its value as a character. This outputs the character 'R' (ASCII 82).\n\nPutting it all together, the visible output of the code is:\n\n```\nNKKR\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider the following BF (Brainf*ck) code.
