    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck code, we need to simulate the execution of the code step by step. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a data pointer to manipulate data. Here's a breakdown of the code:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move the pointer to the right and set the cell to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move the pointer to the right again and set the cell to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move the pointer left and then right, effectively staying in the same position.\n4. `+++++++++`: Increment the current cell (cell 2) by 9.\n5. `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply the value in cell 2 by 13 and store it in cell 1. This results in cell 1 having a value of 117 (9 * 13).\n6. `<--`: Move to cell 0 and decrement it twice, setting it to -2.\n7. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in cell 0, which is 117 ('u').\n8. `------`: Decrement the current cell (cell 0) by 6, setting it to 111.\n9. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in cell 0, which is 111 ('o').\n10. `----`: Decrement the current cell (cell 0) by 4, setting it to 107.\n11. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in cell 0, which is 107 ('k').\n12. `+++++++++`: Increment the current cell (cell 0) by 9, setting it to 116.\n13. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in cell 0, which is 116 ('t').\n14. `-------`: Decrement the current cell (cell 0) by 7, setting it to 109.\n15. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in cell 0, which is 109 ('m').\n16. `<`: Move the pointer to the left (cell 1).\n17. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in cell 1, which is 117 ('u').\n\nThe final output of the Brainf*ck code is:\n\n```\nuoktm\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider the following BF (Brainf*ck) code.
