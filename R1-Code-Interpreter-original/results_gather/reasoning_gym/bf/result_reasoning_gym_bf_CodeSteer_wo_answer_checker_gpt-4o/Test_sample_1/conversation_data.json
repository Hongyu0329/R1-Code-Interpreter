    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck program, we need to simulate the execution of the code step by step. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a data pointer to manipulate data. Here's a breakdown of the program:\n\n1. `>[-]` and `>[-]`: These commands move the data pointer to the right and clear the cells by setting them to zero.\n\n2. `<>++++++++++[<++++++++++>-]`: This part initializes a cell with the value 100. It does this by moving the pointer back and forth and incrementing the cell value.\n\n3. `<+.-.+++++.---.`: This sequence performs the following:\n   - `<+` increments the previous cell (which is zero) by 1.\n   - `.` outputs the ASCII character corresponding to the current cell value (100), which is 'd'.\n   - `-` decrements the cell value to 99.\n   - `.` outputs the ASCII character corresponding to 99, which is 'c'.\n   - `+++++` increments the cell value to 104.\n   - `.` outputs the ASCII character corresponding to 104, which is 'h'.\n   - `---` decrements the cell value to 101.\n   - `.` outputs the ASCII character corresponding to 101, which is 'e'.\n\n4. `>+++[<++++++>-]<+.<`: This part initializes another cell with the value 33, which corresponds to the ASCII character '!'. It then outputs this character.\n\nPutting it all together, the program outputs the characters 'd', 'c', 'h', 'e', and '!' in sequence.\n\nTherefore, the output of the program is:\n\n<<<dche!>>>"
