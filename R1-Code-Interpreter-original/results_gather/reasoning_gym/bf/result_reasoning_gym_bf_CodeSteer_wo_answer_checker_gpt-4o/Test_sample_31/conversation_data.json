    "The given Brainf*ck code is a sequence of commands that manipulate a tape of memory cells, each initially set to zero. Let's break down the code step by step to understand what it does and determine the output:\n\n1. `>[-]` - Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n2. `>[-]` - Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n3. `<>` - Move back to the first cell.\n4. `++++++++++` - Increment the first cell to 10.\n5. `[<++++++++++>-]` - Loop: Move left, add 10 to the second cell, move right, decrement the first cell. This loop runs 10 times, setting the second cell to 100 and the first cell to 0.\n6. `<.` - Move to the second cell and output its value as a character ('d').\n7. `+++++` - Increment the second cell by 5 (now 105).\n8. `.` - Output the second cell as a character ('i').\n9. `+++++` - Increment the second cell by 5 (now 110).\n10. `.` - Output the second cell as a character ('n').\n11. `-------` - Decrement the second cell by 7 (now 103).\n12. `.` - Output the second cell as a character ('g').\n13. `>+++[<++++++>-]` - Move to the third cell, increment it by 3, loop: move left, add 6 to the second cell, move right, decrement the third cell. This loop runs 3 times, setting the second cell to 121.\n14. `<.` - Move to the second cell and output its value as a character ('y').\n\nThe output of the Brainf*ck code is:\n\n```\ndingy\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider the following BF (Brainf*ck) code.
