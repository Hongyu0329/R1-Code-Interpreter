    "The given code is a Brainf*ck program. Let's break down the program step by step to understand what it does and determine the output.\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the second cell and set it to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the third cell and set it to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the first cell.\n4. `+++++++`: Increment the first cell by 7.\n5. `[<++++++++++++++>-]`: This loop will run 7 times (since the first cell is 7). Each iteration:\n   - Move to the second cell and increment it by 14.\n   - Move back to the first cell and decrement it by 1.\n   After the loop, the first cell is 0, and the second cell is 98 (7 * 14).\n6. `<.-`: Move to the first cell and output its value as a character (ASCII 0, which is a non-printable character), then decrement it (remains 0).\n7. `.`: Output the second cell's value as a character (ASCII 98, which is 'b').\n8. `++++++++++`: Increment the second cell by 10 (now 108).\n9. `.`: Output the second cell's value as a character (ASCII 108, which is 'l').\n10. `------`: Decrement the second cell by 6 (now 102).\n11. `.`: Output the second cell's value as a character (ASCII 102, which is 'f').\n12. `+++++++++++++`: Increment the second cell by 13 (now 115).\n13. `.`: Output the second cell's value as a character (ASCII 115, which is 's').\n14. `<`: Move back to the first cell.\n\nThe output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands. Therefore, the output is:\n\n<<<blfs>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
