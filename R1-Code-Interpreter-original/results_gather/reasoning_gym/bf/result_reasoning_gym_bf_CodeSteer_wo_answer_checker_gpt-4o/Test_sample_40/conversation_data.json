    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck program, we need to simulate the execution of the code step by step. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a data pointer to manipulate data. Here's a breakdown of the commands:\n\n1. `>`: Move the data pointer to the right.\n2. `<`: Move the data pointer to the left.\n3. `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n4. `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n5. `[`: Jump forward to the command after the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n6. `]`: Jump back to the command after the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n7. `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n\nLet's go through the program step by step:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to cell 1 and set it to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to cell 2 and set it to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move back to cell 1.\n4. `+++++++`: Increment cell 1 by 7.\n5. `[<++++++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply cell 1 by 14 and store the result in cell 0. This results in cell 0 having the value 98 (7 * 14).\n6. `<.`: Move to cell 0 and output its value as a character ('b').\n7. `++++++++++`: Increment cell 0 by 10 (now 108).\n8. `.`: Output cell 0 as a character ('l').\n9. `-----------`: Decrement cell 0 by 11 (now 97).\n10. `.`: Output cell 0 as a character ('a').\n11. `++`: Increment cell 0 by 2 (now 99).\n12. `.`: Output cell 0 as a character ('c').\n13. `++++++++.`: Increment cell 0 by 8 (now 107) and output as a character ('k').\n14. `++++++`: Increment cell 0 by 6 (now 113).\n15. `.`: Output cell 0 as a character ('q').\n16. `<`: Move to cell 1.\n\nThe output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\nTherefore, the output of the program is:\n\n<<<blackq>>>"
