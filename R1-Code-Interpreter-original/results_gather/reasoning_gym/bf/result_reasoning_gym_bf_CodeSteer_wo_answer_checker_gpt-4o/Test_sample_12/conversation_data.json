    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck program, we need to simulate the execution of the code step by step. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a data pointer to manipulate data. Here's a breakdown of the program:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move the data pointer to the right and set the current cell to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move the data pointer to the right again and set the current cell to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move the data pointer left and then right, effectively staying in the same position.\n4. `+++++++++[<+++++++++++++>-]`: This loop initializes the current cell to 90. It does this by adding 9 to the cell 10 times.\n5. `<.`: Move the data pointer left and output the character represented by the ASCII value in the current cell (90, which is 'Z').\n6. `-------`: Subtract 7 from the current cell (90 - 7 = 83).\n7. `.`: Output the character represented by the ASCII value in the current cell (83, which is 'S').\n8. `----------`: Subtract 10 from the current cell (83 - 10 = 73).\n9. `.`: Output the character represented by the ASCII value in the current cell (73, which is 'I').\n10. `+.`: Add 1 to the current cell (73 + 1 = 74) and output the character (74, which is 'J').\n11. `+++++++++++++.`: Add 13 to the current cell (74 + 13 = 87) and output the character (87, which is 'W').\n12. `<`: Move the data pointer left.\n\nThe output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands. Let's put it all together:\n\n<<<ZSIJW>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
