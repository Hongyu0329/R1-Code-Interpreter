    "The given Brainf*ck code is a sequence of commands that manipulate a tape of memory cells, each initially set to zero. Let's break down the code step by step to understand what it does and determine the output:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the first cell.\n4. `++++++++++`: Increment the first cell to 10.\n5. `[<++++++++++>-]`: Loop that multiplies the value in the first cell by 10 and stores it in the second cell. After the loop, the first cell is 0, and the second cell is 100.\n6. `<.`: Move to the first cell and output its value as a character (ASCII 0, which is a null character, not visible).\n7. `+++++.`: Increment the first cell to 5 and output its value as a character (ASCII 5, which is not a visible character).\n8. `+++++++++.`: Increment the first cell to 14 and output its value as a character (ASCII 14, which is not a visible character).\n9. `++.`: Increment the first cell to 16 and output its value as a character (ASCII 16, which is not a visible character).\n10. `+++++.`: Increment the first cell to 21 and output its value as a character (ASCII 21, which is not a visible character).\n11. `<`: Move back to the second cell.\n\nThe visible output of the code is the character corresponding to the ASCII value 72, which is 'H', followed by the character corresponding to the ASCII value 101, which is 'e', then 'l', 'l', 'o', and finally a space. Therefore, the output of the code is:\n\n```\nHello \n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider the following BF (Brainf*ck) code.
