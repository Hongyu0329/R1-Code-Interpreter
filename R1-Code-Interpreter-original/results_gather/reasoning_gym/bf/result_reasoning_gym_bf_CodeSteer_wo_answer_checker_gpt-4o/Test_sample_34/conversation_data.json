    "The given Brainf*ck code is a sequence of commands that manipulate a tape of memory cells, each initially set to zero. Let's break down the code step by step to understand what it does and determine the output:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the first cell.\n4. `+++++++++`: Increment the first cell by 9.\n5. `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: This loop multiplies the value in the first cell by 13 and stores it in the second cell. The first cell is decremented to zero, and the second cell ends up with 117 (9 * 13).\n6. `<--`: Move back to the first cell and decrement it by 2, resulting in -2.\n7. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value of the first cell, which is not a printable character.\n8. `-----.`: Decrement the first cell by 5 (total -7) and output the character, which is not a printable character.\n9. `+.`: Increment the first cell by 1 (total -6) and output the character, which is not a printable character.\n10. `++++++.`: Increment the first cell by 6 (total 0) and output the character, which is the null character.\n11. `-.`: Decrement the first cell by 1 (total -1) and output the character, which is not a printable character.\n12. `<`: Move back to the second cell.\n13. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value of the second cell, which is 117, corresponding to 'u'.\n\nThe only printable character output by this code is 'u'. Therefore, the exact output of the code is:\n\n```\nu\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider the following BF (Brainf*ck) code.
