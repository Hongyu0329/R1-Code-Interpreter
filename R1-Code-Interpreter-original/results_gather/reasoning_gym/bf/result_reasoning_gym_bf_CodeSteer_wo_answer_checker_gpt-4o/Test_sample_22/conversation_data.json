    "The given Brainf*ck code is a sequence of commands that manipulate a tape of memory cells, each initially set to zero. Let's break down the code step by step to understand what it does and determine the output:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the first cell.\n4. `++++++++++`: Increment the first cell to 10.\n5. `[<+++++++++++>-]`: Loop that multiplies the value in the first cell by 13 and stores it in the second cell. The first cell is decremented to zero, and the second cell ends up with 130.\n6. `<+`: Move to the first cell and increment it by 1 (now 1).\n7. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in the first cell (1), which is a non-printable character (Start of Header).\n8. `+.`: Increment the first cell to 2 and output the corresponding character, which is another non-printable character (Start of Text).\n9. `-------`: Decrement the first cell by 7, resulting in -5 (non-printable).\n10. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in the first cell (-5), which is a non-printable character.\n11. `++++++++++++`: Increment the first cell by 12, resulting in 7.\n12. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in the first cell (7), which is a non-printable character (Bell).\n13. `--------`: Decrement the first cell by 8, resulting in -1 (non-printable).\n14. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in the first cell (-1), which is a non-printable character.\n15. `<`: Move back to the second cell.\n16. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in the second cell (130), which is a non-printable character.\n\nThe output of the code consists of non-printable characters, and it is not meaningful in a typical text context. Therefore, the exact output is a sequence of non-printable characters, which cannot be represented in a standard text format."

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider the following BF (Brainf*ck) code.
