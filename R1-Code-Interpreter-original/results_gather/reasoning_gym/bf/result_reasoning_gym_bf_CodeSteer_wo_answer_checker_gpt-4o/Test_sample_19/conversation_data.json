    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck program, we need to simulate the execution of the code step by step. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a data pointer to manipulate data. Here's a brief explanation of the commands used in Brainf*ck:\n\n- `>`: Move the data pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the data pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n- `[`: Jump forward to the command after the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the command after the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n\nLet's break down the program:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the second cell and set it to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the third cell and set it to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the second cell.\n4. `++++++++`: Increment the second cell to 8.\n5. `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply the second cell by 13 and store the result in the first cell. This results in the first cell being 104 (8 * 13).\n6. `<-.`: Move to the first cell, decrement it to 103, and output it as a character ('g').\n7. `+++++.`: Increment the first cell to 108 and output it as a character ('l').\n8. `---.`: Decrement the first cell to 105 and output it as a character ('i').\n9. `+++++.`: Increment the first cell to 110 and output it as a character ('n').\n10. `++++++.`: Increment the first cell to 116 and output it as a character ('t').\n11. `<`: Move to the second cell.\n\nThe output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\nTherefore, the output of the program is:\n\n<<<glint>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
