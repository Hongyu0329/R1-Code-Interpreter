    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck program, we need to simulate the execution of the code step by step. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a data pointer to manipulate data. Here's a breakdown of the program:\n\n1. `>[-]` - Move the data pointer to the right and set the cell to 0.\n2. `>[-]` - Move the data pointer to the right again and set the cell to 0.\n3. `<` - Move the data pointer back to the left.\n4. `>+++++++++[<+++++++++++++>-]` - This loop sets the current cell to 80. It does this by adding 8 to the cell and then multiplying it by 10 (8 * 10 = 80).\n5. `<--` - Move the data pointer back to the left and subtract 2, resulting in 78.\n6. `.` - Output the ASCII character for 78, which is 'N'.\n7. `---` - Subtract 3, resulting in 75.\n8. `.` - Output the ASCII character for 75, which is 'K'.\n9. `-----------` - Subtract 11, resulting in 64.\n10. `.` - Output the ASCII character for 64, which is '@'.\n11. `----` - Subtract 4, resulting in 60.\n12. `.` - Output the ASCII character for 60, which is '<'.\n13. `++++++++++` - Add 10, resulting in 70.\n14. `.` - Output the ASCII character for 70, which is 'F'.\n15. `<` - Move the data pointer back to the left.\n\nNow, let's put together the output from each step where a `.` is encountered:\n\n- 'N'\n- 'K'\n- '@'\n- '<'\n- 'F'\n\nTherefore, the output of the program is:\n\n<<<NK@<F>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
