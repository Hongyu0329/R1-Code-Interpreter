    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck program, we need to simulate the execution of the code step by step. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a data pointer to manipulate data. Here's a breakdown of the program:\n\n1. `>[-]` and `>[-]`: These commands move the data pointer to the right and set the cells to zero. They effectively clear the first two cells on the tape.\n\n2. `<>`: Moves the data pointer back to the first cell.\n\n3. `+++++++++[<+++++++++++>-]`: This loop initializes the first cell with the value 90. It does this by incrementing the first cell 9 times, then using a loop to multiply it by 10.\n\n4. `<.`: Moves the data pointer to the first cell and outputs its value as a character. The ASCII value 90 corresponds to the character 'Z'.\n\n5. `+++++.`: Increments the first cell by 5, making it 95, and outputs it as a character. The ASCII value 95 corresponds to the character '_'.\n\n6. `-------.`: Decrements the first cell by 7, making it 88, and outputs it as a character. The ASCII value 88 corresponds to the character 'X'.\n\n7. `++++++++++++.`: Increments the first cell by 12, making it 100, and outputs it as a character. The ASCII value 100 corresponds to the character 'd'.\n\n8. `+++.`: Increments the first cell by 3, making it 103, and outputs it as a character. The ASCII value 103 corresponds to the character 'g'.\n\n9. `<`: Moves the data pointer back to the first cell, but this has no effect on the output.\n\nPutting it all together, the output of the program is the sequence of characters corresponding to the ASCII values produced by the program.\n\nThe final output of the program is:\n\n<<<Z_Xdg>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant.

Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
