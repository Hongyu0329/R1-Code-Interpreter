    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck code, we need to simulate the execution of the code step by step. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a data pointer to manipulate data. Here's a breakdown of the code:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move the data pointer to the right and set the current cell to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move the data pointer to the right again and set the current cell to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move the data pointer left and then right, effectively staying in the same position.\n4. `+++++++++[<+++++++++++++>-]`: This loop will increment the current cell by 10 * 9 = 90.\n5. `<--`: Move the data pointer left and decrement the current cell by 2, resulting in 88.\n6. `.`: Output the ASCII character corresponding to the value 88, which is 'X'.\n7. `+.`: Increment the current cell by 1 (making it 89) and output the ASCII character 'Y'.\n8. `---------------`: Decrement the current cell by 15, resulting in 74.\n9. `.`: Output the ASCII character corresponding to the value 74, which is 'J'.\n10. `.`: Output the same character 'J' again.\n11. `-.`: Decrement the current cell by 1 (making it 73) and output the ASCII character 'I'.\n12. `<`: Move the data pointer left.\n\nThe output of the code is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands. Therefore, the exact output of the code is:\n\n```\nXYJJI\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
