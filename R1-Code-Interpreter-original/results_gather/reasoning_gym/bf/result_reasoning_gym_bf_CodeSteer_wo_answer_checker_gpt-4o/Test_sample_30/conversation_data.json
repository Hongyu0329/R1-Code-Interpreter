    "The given Brainf*ck program is a sequence of commands that manipulate a memory tape of cells, each initially set to zero. Let's break down the program step by step to understand what it does:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the first cell.\n4. `+++++++++`: Increment the first cell to 9.\n5. `[<++++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply the first cell by 12, resulting in 108 in the second cell.\n6. `<+.`: Move to the first cell and output its value as a character (9 -> tab character).\n7. `------------`: Decrement the second cell by 12, resulting in 96.\n8. `.`: Output the second cell as a character ('`').\n9. `+++++++++++++`: Increment the second cell by 13, resulting in 109.\n10. `.`: Output the second cell as a character ('m').\n11. `-----.`: Decrement the second cell by 5, resulting in 104, and output it ('h').\n12. `--------.`: Decrement the second cell by 8, resulting in 96, and output it ('`').\n13. `<`: Move to the first cell.\n14. `.`: Output the first cell as a character (9 -> tab character).\n\nThe output of the program is a sequence of characters based on the ASCII values of the cells. The final output is:\n\n<<<\t`mh`\t>>>",
    "Let's re-evaluate the Brainf*ck program step by step to ensure we derive the correct output:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the second cell and set it to zero.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the third cell and set it to zero.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the first cell.\n4. `+++++++++`: Increment the first cell to 9.\n5. `[<++++++++++++>-]`: This loop will run 9 times (since the first cell is 9), and it will:\n   - Move left to the second cell, add 12 to it.\n   - Move right to the first cell, decrement it by 1.\n   - The loop ends when the first cell is zero.\n   - After the loop, the second cell will have 108 (9 * 12).\n6. `<+.`: Move to the first cell, increment it by 1 (making it 1), and output it as a character (ASCII 1 is a non-printable character).\n7. `------------`: Decrement the second cell by 12, resulting in 96.\n8. `.`: Output the second cell as a character ('`').\n9. `+++++++++++++`: Increment the second cell by 13, resulting in 109.\n10. `.`: Output the second cell as a character ('m').\n11. `-----.`: Decrement the second cell by 5, resulting in 104, and output it ('h').\n12. `--------.`: Decrement the second cell by 8, resulting in 96, and output it ('`').\n13. `<`: Move to the first cell.\n14. `.`: Output the first cell as a character (ASCII 1 is a non-printable character).\n\nThe correct output of the program, considering the ASCII values, is:\n\n<<<\u0001`mh`\u0001>>>",

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.

    "The TaskLLM's response seems to have a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the Brainf*ck program. The output should be derived from the ASCII values of the cells after the operations are performed. Please re-evaluate the program step by step, ensuring that each command is correctly interpreted and executed. Pay special attention to the loop and the arithmetic operations to ensure the correct ASCII values are produced. Recalculate the expected output based on these operations.",
    "The TaskLLM's response has improved, but there is still a misunderstanding regarding the output of non-printable ASCII characters. The Brainf*ck program's output should focus on printable characters. Please ensure that the interpretation of the program correctly identifies the ASCII values and their corresponding characters, focusing on the printable ones. Re-evaluate the program, especially the loop and arithmetic operations, to ensure the correct sequence of characters is produced. Recalculate the expected output based on these operations, and ensure that only printable characters are considered in the final output."
