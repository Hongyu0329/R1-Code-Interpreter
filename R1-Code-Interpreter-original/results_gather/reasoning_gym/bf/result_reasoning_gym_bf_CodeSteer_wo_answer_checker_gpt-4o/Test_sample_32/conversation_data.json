    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck program, we need to simulate the execution of the code step by step. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a data pointer to manipulate data. Here's a breakdown of the commands:\n\n1. `>`: Move the data pointer to the right.\n2. `<`: Move the data pointer to the left.\n3. `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n4. `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n5. `[`: Jump forward to the command after the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n6. `]`: Jump back to the command after the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n7. `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n\nLet's simulate the program:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to cell 1 and set it to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to cell 2 and set it to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move back to cell 1.\n4. `++++++++`: Increment cell 1 to 8.\n5. `[<++++++++++++++>-]`: Loop to set cell 0 to 104 (8 * 13) and cell 1 to 0.\n6. `<.`: Move to cell 0 and output 'h' (104).\n7. `----`: Decrement cell 0 to 100.\n8. `.`: Output 'd' (100).\n9. `+++++++++`: Increment cell 0 to 109.\n10. `.`: Output 'm' (109).\n11. `--------`: Decrement cell 0 to 101.\n12. `.`: Output 'e' (101).\n13. `+++`: Increment cell 0 to 104.\n14. `.<`: Output 'h' (104).\n\nThe output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\nTherefore, the output of the program is:\n\n<<<hdmeh>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
