    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck program, we need to simulate the execution of the code step by step. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a pointer to manipulate data. Here's a breakdown of the program:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move the pointer to the right and set the cell to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move the pointer to the right again and set the cell to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move the pointer left and then right, effectively staying in the same position.\n4. `++++++++`: Increment the current cell (let's call it cell 2) by 8.\n5. `[<++++++++++++++>-]`: This loop will run 8 times (since cell 2 is 8), and each time it will:\n   - Move left to cell 1, increment it by 14 (since `++++++++++++++` is 14 pluses).\n   - Move right to cell 2 and decrement it by 1.\n   - The loop ends when cell 2 is 0.\n6. `<.`: Move left to cell 1 and output its value as a character.\n7. `++.`: Increment cell 1 by 2 and output its value as a character.\n8. `---------.`: Decrement cell 1 by 9 and output its value as a character.\n9. `++++.`: Increment cell 1 by 4 and output its value as a character.\n10. `++.`: Increment cell 1 by 2 and output its value as a character.\n11. `<`: Move left to cell 0.\n\nNow, let's calculate the ASCII values and corresponding characters:\n\n- After step 5, cell 1 will have a value of 112 (8 * 14).\n- After step 6, output the character for ASCII 112, which is 'p'.\n- After step 7, cell 1 becomes 114, output the character 'r'.\n- After step 8, cell 1 becomes 105, output the character 'i'.\n- After step 9, cell 1 becomes 109, output the character 'm'.\n- After step 10, cell 1 becomes 111, output the character 'o'.\n\nThus, the output of the program is:\n\n<<<primo>>>"
