    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck program, we need to simulate the execution of the code step by step. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a pointer to manipulate data. Here's a brief explanation of the commands:\n\n- `>`: Move the pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n- `[`: Jump past the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n\nLet's break down the program:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the second cell and clear it.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the third cell and clear it.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the second cell.\n4. `+++++++++`: Set the second cell to 9.\n5. `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply the second cell by 13, resulting in 117 in the first cell.\n6. `<--`: Move to the first cell and decrement it twice, resulting in 115.\n7. `.`: Output the character 's' (ASCII 115).\n8. `++++`: Increment the first cell to 119.\n9. `.`: Output the character 'w' (ASCII 119).\n10. `>+++[<------->-]<-`: Move to the second cell, set it to 3, and then perform a loop to subtract 7 from the first cell three times, resulting in 98.\n11. `.`: Output the character 'b' (ASCII 98).\n12. `>++++[<++++>-]<+`: Move to the second cell, set it to 4, and add 4 to the first cell four times, resulting in 102.\n13. `.`: Output the character 'f' (ASCII 102).\n14. `-----.`: Decrement the first cell five times to 97 and output the character 'a' (ASCII 97).\n15. `<`: Move back to the first cell.\n\nThe output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands. Therefore, the output is:\n\n<<<swbfa>>>"
