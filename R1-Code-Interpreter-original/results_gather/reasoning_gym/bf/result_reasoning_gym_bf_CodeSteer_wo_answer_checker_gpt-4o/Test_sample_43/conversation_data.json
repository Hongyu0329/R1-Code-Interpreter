    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck code, we need to simulate its execution step by step. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a data pointer to manipulate data. Here's a breakdown of the code:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move the pointer to the right and set the cell to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move the pointer to the right again and set the cell to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move the pointer left and then right, effectively staying in the same position.\n4. `++++++++`: Increment the current cell (cell 2) by 8.\n5. `[<++++++++++++++>-]`: This loop will run 8 times, each time moving left, incrementing the cell by 14, moving right, and decrementing the current cell. This results in cell 1 having a value of 112 (8 * 14).\n6. `<.-`: Move left to cell 1, output its value as a character (ASCII 112 is 'p'), and decrement it.\n7. `.`: Output the current value of cell 1 as a character (ASCII 111 is 'o').\n8. `++++++`: Increment the current cell (cell 1) by 6, making it 117.\n9. `.-`: Output the current value of cell 1 as a character (ASCII 117 is 'u') and decrement it.\n10. `.`: Output the current value of cell 1 as a character (ASCII 116 is 't').\n11. `+++++`: Increment the current cell (cell 1) by 5, making it 121.\n12. `.`: Output the current value of cell 1 as a character (ASCII 121 is 'y').\n13. `<`: Move left to cell 0, which is 0.\n\nThe output of the code is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands. Therefore, the exact output of the Brainf*ck code is:\n\n```\npouty\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider the following BF (Brainf*ck) code.
