    "The given Brainf*ck code is a sequence of commands that manipulate a tape of memory cells, each initially set to zero. Let's break down the code step by step to understand what it does and determine the output.\n\n1. `>[-]` - Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n2. `>[-]` - Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n3. `<` - Move back to the previous cell.\n4. `>` - Move to the next cell.\n5. `++++++++` - Increment the current cell (let's call it cell 2) by 8.\n6. `[<++++++++++++++>-]` - This loop will run 8 times (since cell 2 is 8), and each time it will:\n   - Move left to cell 1, increment it by 14.\n   - Move right to cell 2, decrement it by 1.\n   After the loop, cell 1 will have 112 (8 * 14) and cell 2 will be 0.\n7. `<` - Move to cell 1.\n8. `++.` - Increment cell 1 by 2 (making it 114) and output it as a character ('r').\n9. `-------------` - Decrement cell 1 by 13 (making it 101) and output it as a character ('e').\n10. `.` - Output the current cell value as a character ('e').\n11. `+++++++++++++` - Increment cell 1 by 13 (making it 114) and output it as a character ('r').\n12. `.` - Output the current cell value as a character ('r').\n13. `+++` - Increment cell 1 by 3 (making it 117) and output it as a character ('u').\n14. `.` - Output the current cell value as a character ('u').\n15. `-------` - Decrement cell 1 by 7 (making it 110) and output it as a character ('n').\n16. `.` - Output the current cell value as a character ('n').\n17. `<` - Move to cell 0.\n\nThe output of the Brainf*ck code is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands. Therefore, the exact output of the code is:\n\n```\nre-run\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider the following BF (Brainf*ck) code.
