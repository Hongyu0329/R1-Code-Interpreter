    "The given Brainf*ck code is a sequence of commands that manipulate a tape of memory cells, each initially set to zero. Let's break down the code step by step to determine the output:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the first cell.\n4. `+++++++++`: Increment the first cell to 9.\n5. `[<++++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply the first cell by 12, resulting in 108 in the second cell.\n6. `<+.`: Move to the first cell and output its value (9) as a character, which is a tab (`\\t`).\n7. `++.`: Increment the first cell to 11 and output its value as a character, which is a vertical tab (`\\v`).\n8. `---.`: Decrement the first cell to 8 and output its value as a character, which is a backspace (`\\b`).\n9. `-----------.`: Decrement the first cell to -3 and output its value as a character, which is a non-printable character.\n10. `>++++[<++++>-]<+.`: Move to the second cell, increment it to 112, and output its value as a character, which is 'p'.\n11. `<`: Move back to the first cell.\n\nThe output of the code is a sequence of characters: `\\t\\v\\b` followed by a non-printable character and 'p'. However, the non-printable character will not be visible in the output.\n\nTherefore, the exact visible output of the code is:\n\n```\n\tp\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider the following BF (Brainf*ck) code.
