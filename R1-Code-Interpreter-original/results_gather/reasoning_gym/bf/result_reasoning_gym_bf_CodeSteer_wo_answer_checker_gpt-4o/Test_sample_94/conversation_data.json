    "The given Brainf*ck code is a sequence of commands that manipulate a tape of memory cells, each initially set to zero. Let's break down the code step by step to understand what it does and determine the output:\n\n1. `>[-]` - Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n2. `>[-]` - Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n3. `<` - Move back to the previous cell.\n4. `>` - Move to the next cell.\n5. `++++++++++` - Increment the current cell value by 10.\n6. `[<++++++++++>-]` - This loop will run 10 times, moving left, incrementing the cell by 10, moving right, and decrementing the current cell. This effectively sets the left cell to 100 and the current cell to 0.\n7. `<` - Move to the left cell (which now contains 100).\n8. `.` - Output the ASCII character corresponding to the value 100, which is 'd'.\n9. `+++++++++++` - Increment the current cell value by 11 (making it 111).\n10. `.` - Output the ASCII character corresponding to the value 111, which is 'o'.\n11. `-----------` - Decrement the current cell value by 11 (making it 100 again).\n12. `.` - Output the ASCII character corresponding to the value 100, which is 'd'.\n13. `+++` - Increment the current cell value by 3 (making it 103).\n14. `.` - Output the ASCII character corresponding to the value 103, which is 'g'.\n15. `--` - Decrement the current cell value by 2 (making it 101).\n16. `.` - Output the ASCII character corresponding to the value 101, which is 'e'.\n17. `<` - Move to the left cell (which is irrelevant for output).\n\nThe output of the Brainf*ck code is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands. Therefore, the exact output of the code is:\n\n```\ndodge\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider the following BF (Brainf*ck) code.
