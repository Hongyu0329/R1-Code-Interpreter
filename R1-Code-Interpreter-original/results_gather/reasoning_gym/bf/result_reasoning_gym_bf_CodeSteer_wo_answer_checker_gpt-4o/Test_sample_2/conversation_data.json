    "The given Brainf*ck code is a sequence of commands that manipulate a tape of memory cells, each initially set to zero. Let's break down the code step by step to understand what it does and determine the output:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the first cell.\n4. `+++++++++`: Increment the first cell to 9.\n5. `[<+++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply the value in the first cell by 11, resulting in 99 in the second cell.\n6. `<.`: Move back to the first cell and output its value as a character (ASCII 9, which is a tab character).\n7. `>+++`: Move to the second cell and increment it by 3, resulting in 102.\n8. `[<++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply the value in the second cell by 6, resulting in 612 in the first cell.\n9. `<.`: Move back to the first cell and output its value as a character (ASCII 100, which is 'd').\n10. `---`: Decrement the first cell by 3, resulting in 97.\n11. `.`: Output the value of the first cell as a character (ASCII 97, which is 'a').\n12. `++++`: Increment the first cell by 4, resulting in 101.\n13. `.`: Output the value of the first cell as a character (ASCII 101, which is 'e').\n14. `>++++`: Move to the second cell and increment it by 4, resulting in 106.\n15. `[<---->-]`: Loop to subtract 4 from the second cell until it reaches zero, resulting in 26 in the first cell.\n16. `<-.`: Move back to the first cell, decrement it by 1, resulting in 25, and output its value as a character (ASCII 25, which is a non-printable character).\n\nThe output of the code is the sequence of characters corresponding to the ASCII values of the cells that are output. The printable characters in the output are:\n\n- 'd'\n- 'a'\n- 'e'\n\nTherefore, the exact output of the code is:\n\n```\ndae\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider the following BF (Brainf*ck) code.
