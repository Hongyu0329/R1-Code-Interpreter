    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck program, we need to simulate the execution of the code step by step. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a pointer to manipulate data. Here's a breakdown of the commands:\n\n1. `>`: Move the pointer to the right.\n2. `<`: Move the pointer to the left.\n3. `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n4. `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n5. `[`: Jump past the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n6. `]`: Jump back to the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n7. `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n\nLet's simulate the program:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to cell 1 and set it to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to cell 2 and set it to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move back to cell 1.\n4. `+++++++`: Set cell 1 to 7.\n5. `[<++++++++++++++>-]`: Loop 7 times, adding 14 to cell 0 each time, resulting in 98 in cell 0.\n6. `<.`: Move to cell 0 and output its value as a character ('b').\n7. `+++++++.`: Increment cell 0 by 7 (resulting in 105) and output as a character ('i').\n8. `-----..`: Decrement cell 0 by 5 (resulting in 100) and output twice as a character ('dd').\n9. `>+++[<+++++++>-]<`: Move to cell 1, set it to 3, loop 3 times adding 7 to cell 0 each time, resulting in 121 in cell 0.\n10. `.<`: Output the value of cell 0 as a character ('y').\n\nThe output of the program is the concatenation of these characters.\n\nTherefore, the output of the program is:\n\n<<<biddy>>>",
    "<<<biddy>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.

    "The TaskLLM's response correctly simulates the Brainf*ck program step by step and provides the correct output. Therefore, the answer is accurate. You can directly return the answer."
