    "The given Brainf*ck code is a sequence of operations that manipulate a tape of memory cells, each initially set to zero. Let's break down the code step by step to determine the output:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the first cell.\n4. `+++++++++`: Increment the first cell to 9.\n5. `[<+++++++++++>-]`: Loop that multiplies the value in the first cell by 11 and stores it in the second cell. The first cell is decremented to zero, and the second cell ends up with 99.\n6. `<`: Move back to the first cell.\n7. `.--`: Decrement the first cell to -1 and output the character corresponding to ASCII value -1 (which is not a valid character).\n8. `.`: Output the character corresponding to ASCII value -1 again.\n9. `+++++++++++++`: Increment the first cell to 12.\n10. `.`: Output the character corresponding to ASCII value 12 (form feed).\n11. `+.`: Increment the first cell to 13 and output the character corresponding to ASCII value 13 (carriage return).\n12. `----------`: Decrement the first cell to 3.\n13. `.`: Output the character corresponding to ASCII value 3 (end of text).\n14. `<`: Move back to the second cell.\n\nThe output of the Brainf*ck code is a sequence of characters corresponding to the ASCII values manipulated in the code. However, since some of these values are non-printable or invalid, the exact output may not be meaningful or visible.\n\nThe exact output of the code is:\n\n```\n (non-printable characters)\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider the following BF (Brainf*ck) code.
