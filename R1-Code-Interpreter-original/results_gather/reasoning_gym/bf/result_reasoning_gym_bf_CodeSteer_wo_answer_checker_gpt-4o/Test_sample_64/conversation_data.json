    "The given Brainf*ck code is a sequence of operations that manipulate a tape of memory cells, each initially set to zero. Let's break down the code step by step to understand what it does:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the first cell.\n4. `+++++++`: Increment the first cell by 7.\n5. `[<+++++++++++++++>-]`: This loop will run 7 times (since the first cell is 7), and it will increment the second cell by 15 each time, resulting in the second cell being 105 (7 * 15).\n6. `<.`: Move back to the first cell and output its value as a character. The first cell is 0, so it outputs a null character (not visible).\n7. `-----.`: Decrement the first cell by 5 (making it -5) and output its value as a character. This outputs the character with ASCII value 251 (since -5 wraps around in the 0-255 range).\n8. `+++++.`: Increment the first cell by 5 (making it 0) and output its value as a character. This outputs a null character (not visible).\n9. `++++++.`: Increment the first cell by 6 (making it 6) and output its value as a character. This outputs the character with ASCII value 6 (not visible).\n10. `--.`: Decrement the first cell by 2 (making it 4) and output its value as a character. This outputs the character with ASCII value 4 (not visible).\n11. `<`: Move back to the first cell.\n\nThe visible output of this Brainf*ck code is the character with ASCII value 251, which is \"รป\" in the extended ASCII table.\n\nTherefore, the exact output of the code is:\n\n```\nรป\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider the following BF (Brainf*ck) code.
