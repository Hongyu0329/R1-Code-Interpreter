    "The given Brainf*ck code is a sequence of operations that manipulate a tape of memory cells, each initially set to zero. Let's break down the code step by step to understand what it does and determine the output:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the first cell.\n4. `+++++++++`: Increment the first cell to 9.\n5. `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: This loop will run 9 times (since the first cell is 9). In each iteration, it:\n   - Moves left to the second cell, increments it by 13.\n   - Moves right to the first cell, decrements it by 1.\n   - The loop ends when the first cell is zero.\n6. `<+.`: Move to the second cell and output its value as a character. The second cell now contains 117 (9 * 13), which corresponds to the ASCII character 'u'.\n7. `-------------.`: Decrement the second cell by 13 and output its value as a character. The second cell now contains 104, which corresponds to the ASCII character 'h'.\n8. `--.`: Decrement the second cell by 2 and output its value as a character. The second cell now contains 102, which corresponds to the ASCII character 'f'.\n9. `++.`: Increment the second cell by 2 and output its value as a character. The second cell now contains 104, which corresponds to the ASCII character 'h'.\n10. `+++.`: Increment the second cell by 3 and output its value as a character. The second cell now contains 107, which corresponds to the ASCII character 'k'.\n11. `<`: Move back to the first cell.\n\nThe output of the Brainf*ck code is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands. Therefore, the exact output of the code is:\n\n```\nuhfhk\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider the following BF (Brainf*ck) code.
