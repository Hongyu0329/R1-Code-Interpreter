    "The given Brainf*ck code is a sequence of commands that manipulate a tape of memory cells, each initially set to zero. Let's break down the code step by step to understand what it does:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the first cell.\n4. `++++++++`: Increment the first cell by 8.\n5. `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply the value in the first cell by 13 and store it in the second cell. This results in the second cell having a value of 104 (8 * 13).\n6. `<-.`: Move to the first cell and decrement it by 1, then output the ASCII character corresponding to the value in the first cell (7), which is a bell character (non-printable).\n7. `+++++++++++.`: Increment the first cell by 10 (making it 17) and output the corresponding ASCII character, which is a non-printable character.\n8. `---.`: Decrement the first cell by 3 (making it 14) and output the corresponding ASCII character, which is a non-printable character.\n9. `++++++++.`: Increment the first cell by 8 (making it 22) and output the corresponding ASCII character, which is a non-printable character.\n10. `-----------.`: Decrement the first cell by 11 (making it 11) and output the corresponding ASCII character, which is a non-printable character.\n11. `<`: Move to the second cell.\n12. `.`: Output the ASCII character corresponding to the value in the second cell (104), which is 'h'.\n\nThe only printable character in the output is 'h'. Therefore, the exact output of the code is:\n\n```\nh\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider the following BF (Brainf*ck) code.
