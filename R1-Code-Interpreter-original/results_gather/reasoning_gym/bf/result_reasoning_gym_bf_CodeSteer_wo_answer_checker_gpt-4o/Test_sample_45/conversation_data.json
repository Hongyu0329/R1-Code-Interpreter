    "The given Brainf*ck code is a sequence of commands that manipulate a tape of memory cells, each initially set to zero. Let's break down the code step by step to understand what it does and determine the output:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the second cell and set it to zero.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the third cell and set it to zero.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the second cell.\n4. `+++++++++`: Increment the second cell to 9.\n5. `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: Loop that multiplies the value in the second cell (9) by 13, resulting in 117 in the first cell.\n6. `<--`: Move to the first cell and decrement it twice, resulting in 115.\n7. `.`: Output the ASCII character for 115, which is 's'.\n8. `-----------`: Decrement the first cell by 11, resulting in 104.\n9. `.`: Output the ASCII character for 104, which is 'h'.\n10. `---`: Decrement the first cell by 3, resulting in 101.\n11. `.`: Output the ASCII character for 101, which is 'e'.\n12. `----`: Decrement the first cell by 4, resulting in 97.\n13. `.`: Output the ASCII character for 97, which is 'a'.\n14. `>++++[<++++>-]`: Move to the second cell, increment it by 4, and multiply by 4, resulting in 16 in the first cell.\n15. `<+`: Move to the first cell and increment it by 1, resulting in 17.\n16. `.`: Output the ASCII character for 17, which is a non-printable control character.\n\nThe output of the code is the string \"shea\" followed by a non-printable character. However, since the non-printable character is not typically displayed, the visible output is:\n\n```\nshea\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider the following BF (Brainf*ck) code.
