    "The given Brainf*ck code is a sequence of commands that manipulate a tape of memory cells, each initially set to zero. Let's break down the code step by step to determine the output:\n\n1. `>[-]` - Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n2. `>[-]` - Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n3. `<` - Move back to the previous cell.\n4. `>+++++++` - Move to the next cell and increment it by 7.\n5. `[<++++++++++++++>-]` - This loop will run 7 times, incrementing the previous cell by 14 each time. This results in the previous cell having a value of 98 (7 * 14).\n6. `<.` - Move back to the previous cell and output its value as a character. The ASCII value 98 corresponds to the character 'b'.\n7. `++++++++++` - Increment the current cell by 10, making it 108.\n8. `.` - Output the current cell's value as a character. The ASCII value 108 corresponds to the character 'l'.\n9. `-----------` - Decrement the current cell by 11, making it 97.\n10. `.` - Output the current cell's value as a character. The ASCII value 97 corresponds to the character 'a'.\n11. `+++` - Increment the current cell by 3, making it 100.\n12. `.` - Output the current cell's value as a character. The ASCII value 100 corresponds to the character 'd'.\n13. `+` - Increment the current cell by 1, making it 101.\n14. `.` - Output the current cell's value as a character. The ASCII value 101 corresponds to the character 'e'.\n15. `<` - Move back to the previous cell.\n\nThe final output of the Brainf*ck code is:\n\n```\nblade\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider the following BF (Brainf*ck) code.
