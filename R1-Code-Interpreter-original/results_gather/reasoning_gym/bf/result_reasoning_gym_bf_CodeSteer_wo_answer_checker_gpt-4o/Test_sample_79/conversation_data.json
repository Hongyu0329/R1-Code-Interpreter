    "The given Brainf*ck code is a sequence of commands that manipulate a tape of memory cells, each initially set to zero. Let's break down the code step by step to understand what it does:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the first cell.\n4. `+++++++`: Increment the first cell by 7.\n5. `[<++++++++++++++>-]`: This loop will run 7 times (since the first cell is 7), and it will increment the second cell by 14 each time, resulting in the second cell being 98 (7 * 14).\n6. `<.`: Move back to the first cell and output its value as a character. The first cell is 0, so it outputs a null character (not visible).\n7. `++++++++++`: Increment the first cell by 10.\n8. `.`: Output the value of the first cell as a character, which is now 10 (newline character).\n9. `+++`: Increment the first cell by 3, making it 13.\n10. `.`: Output the value of the first cell as a character, which is now 13 (carriage return character).\n11. `.`: Output the value of the first cell again, which is still 13 (carriage return character).\n12. `--`: Decrement the first cell by 2, making it 11.\n13. `.`: Output the value of the first cell as a character, which is now 11 (vertical tab character).\n14. `<`: Move back to the second cell.\n\nThe visible output of this Brainf*ck code is a newline character followed by two carriage return characters. However, these are control characters and may not be visible or may affect the formatting of the output. The exact visible output is:\n\n```\n```\n\n(Note: The output is not visible as it consists of control characters.)"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider the following BF (Brainf*ck) code.
