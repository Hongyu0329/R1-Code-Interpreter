    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck program, we need to simulate its execution step by step. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory array and a pointer to manipulate data. Here's a brief explanation of the commands:\n\n- `>`: Increment the memory pointer.\n- `<`: Decrement the memory pointer.\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the memory pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the memory pointer.\n- `[`: Jump forward to the command after the matching `]` if the byte at the memory pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the command after the matching `[` if the byte at the memory pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the memory pointer as a character.\n\nLet's break down the program:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the second cell and set it to zero.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the third cell and set it to zero.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the second cell.\n4. `+++++++++`: Increment the second cell to 9.\n5. `[<+++++++++++>-]`: Loop: Move to the first cell, increment it by 11, move back to the second cell, decrement it by 1. Repeat until the second cell is zero. This results in the first cell being set to 99 (9 * 11).\n6. `<.`: Move to the first cell and output its value as a character ('c').\n7. `+++++.`: Increment the first cell by 5 (making it 104) and output it as a character ('h').\n8. `+++++++.`: Increment the first cell by 7 (making it 111) and output it as a character ('o').\n9. `------.`: Decrement the first cell by 6 (making it 105) and output it as a character ('i').\n10. `+++++++++.`: Increment the first cell by 9 (making it 114) and output it as a character ('r').\n11. `<`: Move back to the second cell.\n\nThe output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\nTherefore, the output of the program is:\n\n<<<choir>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
