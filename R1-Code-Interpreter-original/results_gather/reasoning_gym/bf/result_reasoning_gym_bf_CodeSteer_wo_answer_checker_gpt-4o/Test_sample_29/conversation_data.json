    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck program, we need to simulate the execution of the code step by step. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a data pointer to manipulate data. Here's a breakdown of the program:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move the data pointer to the right and set the cell to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move the data pointer to the right again and set the cell to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move the data pointer left and then right, effectively staying in the same position.\n4. `+++++++++[<++++++++++++>-]`: This loop initializes the current cell to 80. It does this by adding 10 to the cell 8 times.\n5. `<+.`: Move the data pointer left and output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in the current cell (80, which is 'P').\n6. `------------`: Subtract 12 from the current cell (80 - 12 = 68, which is 'D').\n7. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value 68 ('D').\n8. `++++++++++++`: Add 12 to the current cell (68 + 12 = 80, which is 'P').\n9. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value 80 ('P').\n10. `-----------`: Subtract 11 from the current cell (80 - 11 = 69, which is 'E').\n11. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value 69 ('E').\n12. `+++++++++++++`: Add 13 to the current cell (69 + 13 = 82, which is 'R').\n13. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value 82 ('R').\n14. `<`: Move the data pointer left.\n15. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in the current cell (80, which is 'P').\n\nThe output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands. Therefore, the output of the program is:\n\n<<<PDPERP>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
