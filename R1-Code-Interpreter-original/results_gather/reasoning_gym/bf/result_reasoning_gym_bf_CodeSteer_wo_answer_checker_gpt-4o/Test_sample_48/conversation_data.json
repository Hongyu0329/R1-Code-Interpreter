    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck code, we need to simulate the execution of the code step by step. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a data pointer to manipulate data. Here's a breakdown of the code:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move the pointer to the right and set the cell to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move the pointer to the right again and set the cell to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move the pointer left and then right, effectively staying in the same position.\n4. `+++++++++`: Increment the current cell (cell 2) by 9.\n5. `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: This loop will run 9 times (since the current cell is 9), and each time it will:\n   - Move left to cell 1, increment it by 13.\n   - Move right to cell 2, decrement it by 1.\n6. After the loop, cell 1 will have the value 117 (9 * 13) and cell 2 will be 0.\n7. `<--`: Move left to cell 1 and decrement it by 2, resulting in 115.\n8. `.`: Output the ASCII character for the value in cell 1, which is 's'.\n9. `-----------`: Decrement cell 1 by 11, resulting in 104.\n10. `.`: Output the ASCII character for the value in cell 1, which is 'h'.\n11. `---`: Decrement cell 1 by 3, resulting in 101.\n12. `.`: Output the ASCII character for the value in cell 1, which is 'e'.\n13. `++++`: Increment cell 1 by 4, resulting in 105.\n14. `.`: Output the ASCII character for the value in cell 1, which is 'i'.\n15. `++`: Increment cell 1 by 2, resulting in 107.\n16. `.`: Output the ASCII character for the value in cell 1, which is 'k'.\n17. `<`: Move left to cell 0, which is 0.\n\nThe output of the code is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands. Therefore, the exact output of the Brainf*ck code is:\n\n```\nsheik\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider the following BF (Brainf*ck) code.
