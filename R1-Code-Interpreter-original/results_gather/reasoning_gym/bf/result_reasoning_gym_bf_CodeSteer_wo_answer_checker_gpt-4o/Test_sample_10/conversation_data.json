    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck program, we need to simulate the execution of the code step by step. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a data pointer to manipulate data. Here's a brief explanation of the commands used in the program:\n\n- `>`: Move the data pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the data pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n- `[`: Jump forward to the command after the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the command after the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n\nLet's break down the program:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the second cell and set it to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the third cell and set it to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the second cell.\n4. `++++++++++`: Set the second cell to 10.\n5. `[<+++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply the value in the second cell by 11 and store it in the first cell. This results in the first cell having a value of 110 and the second cell being 0.\n6. `<+`: Move to the first cell and increment it by 1, resulting in 111.\n7. `.-`: Output the character 'o' (ASCII 111) and decrement the first cell to 110.\n8. `+++++`: Increment the first cell to 115.\n9. `.`: Output the character 's' (ASCII 115).\n10. `--------------`: Decrement the first cell to 99.\n11. `.`: Output the character 'c' (ASCII 99).\n12. `+++++++++++++++`: Increment the first cell to 116.\n13. `.`: Output the character 't' (ASCII 116).\n14. `<`: Move to the second cell.\n15. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the value in the second cell, which is 0 (null character, typically not visible).\n\nThe visible output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\nTherefore, the output of the program is:\n\n<<<osct>>>"
