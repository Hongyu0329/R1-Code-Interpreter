    "The given Brainf*ck code is a sequence of commands that manipulate a tape of memory cells, each initially set to zero. Let's break down the code step by step to understand what it does and determine the output:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the first cell.\n4. `+++++++++`: Increment the first cell by 9.\n5. `[<++++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply the value in the first cell by 12 and store it in the second cell. This results in the second cell having a value of 108 (9 * 12).\n6. `<+.`: Move to the first cell and output its value as a character (9), then move to the second cell.\n7. `++.`: Increment the second cell by 2 (making it 110) and output its value as a character ('n').\n8. `+++++++.`: Increment the second cell by 7 (making it 117) and output its value as a character ('u').\n9. `-------------.`: Decrement the second cell by 13 (making it 104) and output its value as a character ('h').\n10. `----.<`: Decrement the second cell by 4 (making it 100) and output its value as a character ('d'), then move to the first cell.\n\nThe output of the code is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands. Therefore, the exact output of the Brainf*ck code is:\n\n```\n9nuhd\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider the following BF (Brainf*ck) code.
