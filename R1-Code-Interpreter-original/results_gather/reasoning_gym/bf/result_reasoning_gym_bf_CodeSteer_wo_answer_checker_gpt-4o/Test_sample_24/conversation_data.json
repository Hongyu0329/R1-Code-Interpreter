    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck program, we need to simulate the execution of the code step by step. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a data pointer to manipulate data. Here's a breakdown of the program:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move the data pointer to the right and set the current cell to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move the data pointer to the right again and set the current cell to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move the data pointer left and then right, effectively staying in the same position.\n4. `+++++++++[<+++++++++++++>-]`: This loop initializes the current cell to 72. It does this by incrementing the cell by 8, then using a loop to multiply it by 9 (8 * 9 = 72).\n5. `<-.`: Move the data pointer left and output the character represented by the current cell value (72, which is 'H'), then decrement the cell to 71.\n6. `-----.`: Decrement the cell by 5 (71 - 5 = 66) and output the character represented by the new cell value (66, which is 'B').\n7. `+++.+.`: Increment the cell by 3 (66 + 3 = 69) and output the character (69, which is 'E'), then increment by 1 (69 + 1 = 70) and output the character (70, which is 'F').\n8. `----.`: Decrement the cell by 4 (70 - 4 = 66) and output the character (66, which is 'B').\n9. `<`: Move the data pointer left.\n\nThe output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands. Let's put it all together:\n\n- 'H' (72)\n- 'B' (66)\n- 'E' (69)\n- 'F' (70)\n- 'B' (66)\n\nTherefore, the output of the program is:\n\n<<<HBEFB>>>"
