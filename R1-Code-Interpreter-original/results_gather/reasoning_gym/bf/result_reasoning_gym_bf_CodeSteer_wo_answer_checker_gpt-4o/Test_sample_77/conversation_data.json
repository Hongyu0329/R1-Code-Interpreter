    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck program, we need to simulate the execution of the code step by step. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a data pointer to manipulate data. Here's a brief explanation of the commands:\n\n- `>`: Move the data pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the data pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n- `[`: Jump forward to the command after the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the command after the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n\nLet's break down the program:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the second cell and set it to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the third cell and set it to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the first cell.\n4. `+++++++++[<+++++++++++++>-]`: Set the first cell to 72 (8 * 9) by incrementing it 8 times and then multiplying by 9.\n5. `<+.`: Output the first cell as a character ('H').\n6. `>++++[<---->-]`: Move to the second cell, set it to 4, and then multiply by 4 to get 16.\n7. `<-.`: Output the first cell decremented by 1 as a character ('e').\n8. `+++++++++.`: Increment the first cell to 72 and output as a character ('l').\n9. `+++++++.`: Increment the first cell to 79 and output as a character ('o').\n10. `>++++[<---->-]`: Move to the second cell, set it to 4, and then multiply by 4 to get 16.\n11. `<.`: Output the first cell as a character (' ').\n\nThe output of the program is the string \"Hello\".\n\nTherefore, the output of the program is:\n\n<<<Hello>>>",
    "Let's simulate the Brainf*ck program step by step to ensure we derive the correct output. We'll track the memory tape and the data pointer as we execute each command.\n\n1. Initialize the memory tape with zeros and set the data pointer to the first cell.\n\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the second cell and set it to 0.  \n   Memory: [0, 0, 0, ...], Pointer: 1\n\n3. `>[-]`: Move to the third cell and set it to 0.  \n   Memory: [0, 0, 0, ...], Pointer: 2\n\n4. `<>`: Move back to the first cell.  \n   Memory: [0, 0, 0, ...], Pointer: 0\n\n5. `+++++++++[<+++++++++++++>-]`: \n   - Increment the first cell 9 times (value becomes 9).\n   - Enter loop: Move to the second cell, increment it 11 times (value becomes 11), move back, decrement the first cell.\n   - Repeat until the first cell is 0. This results in the second cell being 99.  \n   Memory: [0, 99, 0, ...], Pointer: 0\n\n6. `<+.`: Increment the first cell (value becomes 1) and output it as a character ('A').  \n   Memory: [1, 99, 0, ...], Pointer: 0\n\n7. `>++++[<---->-]`: \n   - Move to the second cell, increment it 4 times (value becomes 103).\n   - Enter loop: Move to the first cell, decrement it 4 times, move back, decrement the second cell.\n   - Repeat until the second cell is 0. This results in the first cell being 0.  \n   Memory: [0, 0, 0, ...], Pointer: 1\n\n8. `<-.`: Move to the first cell, decrement it (value becomes -1, but in Brainf*ck, it wraps around to 255), and output it as a character ('ÿ').  \n   Memory: [255, 0, 0, ...], Pointer: 0\n\n9. `+++++++++.`: Increment the first cell 9 times (value becomes 8) and output it as a character ('\\b').  \n   Memory: [8, 0, 0, ...], Pointer: 0\n\n10. `+++++++.`: Increment the first cell 7 times (value becomes 15) and output it as a character ('\\x0f').  \n    Memory: [15, 0, 0, ...], Pointer: 0\n\n11. `>++++[<---->-]`: \n    - Move to the second cell, increment it 4 times (value becomes 4).\n    - Enter loop: Move to the first cell, decrement it 4 times, move back, decrement the second cell.\n    - Repeat until the second cell is 0. This results in the first cell being 0.  \n    Memory: [0, 0, 0, ...], Pointer: 1\n\n12. `<.`: Move to the first cell and output it as a character ('\\x00').  \n    Memory: [0, 0, 0, ...], Pointer: 0\n\nThe output of the program is the sequence of characters: 'Aÿ\\b\\x0f\\x00'.\n\nTherefore, the correct output of the program is:\n\n<<<Aÿ\b\u000f\u0000>>>",
