    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck code, we need to simulate the execution of the code step by step. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a data pointer to manipulate data. Here's a breakdown of the code:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move the pointer to the right and set the cell to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move the pointer to the right again and set the cell to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move the pointer left and then right, effectively staying in the same position.\n4. `+++++++`: Increment the current cell (let's call it cell 2) by 7.\n5. `[<++++++++++++++>-]`: This loop will run 7 times (since cell 2 is 7), and each time it will:\n   - Move left to cell 1, increment it by 14.\n   - Move right to cell 2, decrement it by 1.\n   After the loop, cell 1 will have 98 (7 * 14) and cell 2 will be 0.\n6. `<.`: Move left to cell 1 and output its value as a character. The ASCII value 98 corresponds to 'b'.\n7. `+++`: Increment cell 1 by 3, making it 101.\n8. `.`: Output the character corresponding to ASCII value 101, which is 'e'.\n9. `++.`: Increment cell 1 by 2, making it 103, and output 'g'.\n10. `++++++++++++++.`: Increment cell 1 by 14, making it 117, and output 'u'.\n11. `-------.`: Decrement cell 1 by 7, making it 110, and output 'n'.\n12. `<`: Move left to cell 0 (which is 0).\n\nThe output of the code is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\n```plaintext\nbegun\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider the following BF (Brainf*ck) code.
