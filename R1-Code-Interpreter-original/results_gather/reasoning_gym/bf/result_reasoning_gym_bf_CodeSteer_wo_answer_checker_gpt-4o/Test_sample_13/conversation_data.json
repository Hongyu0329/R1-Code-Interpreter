    "The given Brainf*ck code is a sequence of commands that manipulate a tape of memory cells, each initially set to zero. Let's break down the code step by step to determine its output:\n\n1. `>[-]` - Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n2. `>[-]` - Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n3. `<` - Move back to the previous cell.\n4. `>` - Move to the next cell.\n5. `+++++++++` - Increment the current cell (let's call it cell 2) by 9.\n6. `[<++++++++++++>-]` - This loop will run 9 times (since cell 2 is 9), and each time it will:\n   - Move left to cell 1 and increment it by 12.\n   - Move right to cell 2 and decrement it by 1.\n   After the loop, cell 1 will have 108 (9 * 12) and cell 2 will be 0.\n7. `<` - Move to cell 1.\n8. `+` - Increment cell 1 by 1, making it 109.\n9. `.` - Output the character corresponding to ASCII value 109, which is 'm'.\n10. `----` - Decrement cell 1 by 4, making it 105.\n11. `.` - Output the character corresponding to ASCII value 105, which is 'i'.\n12. `++++++++++` - Increment cell 1 by 10, making it 115.\n13. `.` - Output the character corresponding to ASCII value 115, which is 's'.\n14. `.` - Output the character corresponding to ASCII value 115 again, which is 's'.\n15. `++++++` - Increment cell 1 by 6, making it 121.\n16. `.` - Output the character corresponding to ASCII value 121, which is 'y'.\n17. `<` - Move to cell 0 (which is 0).\n18. `.` - Output the character corresponding to ASCII value 0, which is a null character (often not visible).\n\nThe visible output of the code is \"missy\"."

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider the following BF (Brainf*ck) code.
