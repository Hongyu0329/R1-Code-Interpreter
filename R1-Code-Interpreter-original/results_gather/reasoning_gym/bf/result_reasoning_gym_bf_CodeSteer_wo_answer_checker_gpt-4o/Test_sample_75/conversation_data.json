    "The given Brainf*ck code is a sequence of commands that manipulate a tape of memory cells, each initially set to zero. Let's break down the code step by step to understand what it does:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the first cell.\n4. `++++++++++`: Increment the first cell to 10.\n5. `[<+++++++++++>-]`: Loop that multiplies the value in the first cell by 13 and stores it in the second cell. The first cell is decremented to zero, and the second cell ends up with 130.\n6. `<+.`: Move back to the first cell, increment it by 1 (making it 1), and output it as a character (ASCII 1, which is a non-printable character).\n7. `+++++..`: Increment the first cell by 5 (making it 6) and output it twice as a character (ASCII 6, which is also a non-printable character).\n8. `---------------.`: Decrement the first cell by 15 (making it -9, which wraps around to 247 in unsigned 8-bit arithmetic) and output it as a character (ASCII 247, which is 'รท').\n9. `+++++++++++++.<`: Increment the first cell by 13 (making it 4) and output it as a character (ASCII 4, which is a non-printable character).\n\nThe output of the code consists of non-printable characters and one printable character 'รท'. Therefore, the exact output of the code is:\n\n```\nรท\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider the following BF (Brainf*ck) code.
