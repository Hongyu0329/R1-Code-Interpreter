    "The given Brainf*ck code is a sequence of operations that manipulate a tape of memory cells, each initially set to zero. Let's break down the code step by step to determine the output:\n\n1. `>[-]` and `>[-]`: These two operations move the pointer to the second and third cells and set them to zero. Since all cells are initially zero, these operations have no effect.\n\n2. `<>`: Moves the pointer back to the first cell.\n\n3. `+++++++++[<+++++++++++++>-]`: This loop sets the first cell to 72. It does this by incrementing the first cell 9 times (to 9), then using a loop to multiply it by 8 (9 * 8 = 72).\n\n4. `<--.`: Moves back to the first cell, decrements it twice (72 - 2 = 70), and outputs the ASCII character 'F' (ASCII 70).\n\n5. `>+++[<------>-]`: Moves to the second cell, increments it 3 times (to 3), then uses a loop to multiply it by -6 (3 * -6 = -18), effectively setting it to 0.\n\n6. `<.`: Moves back to the first cell and outputs the ASCII character 'F' again.\n\n7. `>++++[<+++++>-]`: Moves to the second cell, increments it 4 times (to 4), then uses a loop to multiply it by 5 (4 * 5 = 20).\n\n8. `<.`: Moves back to the first cell and outputs the ASCII character 'F' again.\n\n9. `>+++[<------>-]`: Moves to the second cell, increments it 3 times (to 3), then uses a loop to multiply it by -6 (3 * -6 = -18), effectively setting it to 0.\n\n10. `<.++.<`: Moves back to the first cell, outputs the ASCII character 'F', increments it twice (70 + 2 = 72), and moves back to the first cell.\n\nThe output of the Brainf*ck code is:\n\n```\nFFF\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider the following BF (Brainf*ck) code.
