    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck program, we need to simulate the execution of the code step by step. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a data pointer to manipulate data. Here's a breakdown of the program:\n\n1. `>[-]` and `>[-]`: These commands move the data pointer to the right and set the cells to zero. The first two cells are initialized to zero.\n\n2. `<>`: Moves the data pointer back to the first cell.\n\n3. `++++++++`: Increments the value at the current cell (cell 0) by 8.\n\n4. `[<++++++++++++++>-]`: This loop multiplies the value in cell 0 by 14 and stores the result in cell 1. After the loop, cell 0 is zero, and cell 1 contains 112.\n\n5. `<++`: Moves back to cell 0 and increments it by 2.\n\n6. `.`: Outputs the character corresponding to the ASCII value in cell 0, which is 2 (non-printable).\n\n7. `-------------.`: Decrements the value in cell 0 by 13 (2 - 13 = -11) and outputs the character corresponding to the ASCII value -11 (non-printable).\n\n8. `+++++++++.`: Increments the value in cell 0 by 9 (-11 + 9 = -2) and outputs the character corresponding to the ASCII value -2 (non-printable).\n\n9. `-------------.`: Decrements the value in cell 0 by 13 (-2 - 13 = -15) and outputs the character corresponding to the ASCII value -15 (non-printable).\n\n10. `+++++++++++.`: Increments the value in cell 0 by 11 (-15 + 11 = -4) and outputs the character corresponding to the ASCII value -4 (non-printable).\n\n11. `<`: Moves back to cell 1.\n\nThe program outputs non-printable characters, which are not visible. Therefore, the output of the program is an empty string.\n\n<<<>>>",
