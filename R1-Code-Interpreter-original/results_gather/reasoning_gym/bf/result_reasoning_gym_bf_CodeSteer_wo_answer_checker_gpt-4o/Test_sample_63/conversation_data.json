    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck program, we need to simulate the execution of the code step by step. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a data pointer to manipulate data. Here's a breakdown of the program:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move the data pointer to the right and set the cell to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move the data pointer to the right again and set the cell to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move the data pointer left and then right, effectively staying in the same position.\n4. `+++++++++`: Increment the current cell (cell 2) by 9.\n5. `[<++++++++++++>-]`: Loop that multiplies the value in the current cell by 12 and stores it in the previous cell (cell 1). This results in cell 1 having a value of 108 (9 * 12).\n6. `<-.`: Move the data pointer left to cell 1 and output the character corresponding to the ASCII value 108, which is 'l'.\n7. `+++`: Increment the current cell (cell 1) by 3, making it 111.\n8. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value 111, which is 'o'.\n9. `+.`: Increment the current cell (cell 1) by 1, making it 112, and output the character 'p'.\n10. `++++++++.`: Increment the current cell (cell 1) by 8, making it 120, and output the character 'x'.\n11. `---------.`: Decrement the current cell (cell 1) by 9, making it 111, and output the character 'o'.\n12. `<`: Move the data pointer left to cell 0, which is 0.\n\nThe output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\nTherefore, the output of the program is:\n\n<<<lopxo>>>"
