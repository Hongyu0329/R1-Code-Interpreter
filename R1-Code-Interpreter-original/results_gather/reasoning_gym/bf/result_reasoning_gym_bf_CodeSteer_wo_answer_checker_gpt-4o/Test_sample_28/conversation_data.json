    "The given Brainf*ck code is a sequence of commands that manipulate a tape of memory cells, each initially set to zero. Let's break down the code step by step to understand what it does and determine the output:\n\n1. `>[-]` - Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n2. `>[-]` - Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n3. `<` - Move back to the previous cell.\n4. `>` - Move to the next cell.\n5. `+++++++++` - Increment the current cell (let's call it cell 2) by 9.\n6. `[<+++++++++++++>-]` - This loop will run 9 times, incrementing the previous cell (cell 1) by 13 each time, resulting in cell 1 having a value of 117.\n7. `<--` - Move back to cell 0 and decrement it twice, resulting in a value of -2.\n8. `.` - Output the ASCII character corresponding to the value in cell 0, which is not a printable character.\n9. `++++` - Increment cell 0 by 4, resulting in a value of 2.\n10. `.` - Output the ASCII character corresponding to the value in cell 0, which is not a printable character.\n11. `>+++` - Move to cell 1 and increment it by 3, resulting in a value of 120.\n12. `[<------->-]` - This loop will run 120 times, decrementing cell 1 by 7 each time and incrementing cell 0 by 1 each time, resulting in cell 0 having a value of 120.\n13. `<` - Move back to cell 0.\n14. `-.` - Decrement cell 0 by 1, resulting in a value of 119, and output the corresponding ASCII character, which is 'w'.\n15. `++++++++++++` - Increment cell 0 by 12, resulting in a value of 131.\n16. `.` - Output the ASCII character corresponding to the value in cell 0, which is not a printable character.\n17. `+++` - Increment cell 0 by 3, resulting in a value of 134.\n18. `.` - Output the ASCII character corresponding to the value in cell 0, which is not a printable character.\n19. `<` - Move back to cell 0.\n\nThe output of the code is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands. The only printable character in this sequence is 'w'. Therefore, the exact output of the code is:\n\n```\nw\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider the following BF (Brainf*ck) code.
