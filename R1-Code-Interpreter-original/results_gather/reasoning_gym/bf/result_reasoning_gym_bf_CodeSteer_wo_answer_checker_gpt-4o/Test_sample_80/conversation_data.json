    "The given Brainf*ck code is a sequence of operations that manipulate a tape of memory cells, each initially set to zero. Let's break down the code step by step to understand what it does:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the first cell.\n4. `++++++++`: Increment the first cell by 8.\n5. `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: Loop that multiplies the value in the first cell by 13 and stores it in the second cell. This results in the second cell having a value of 104 (8 * 13).\n6. `<-.`: Move back to the first cell and output its value as a character, then decrement it. The first cell is 0, so this outputs a null character (not visible).\n7. `+++++++++++.`: Increment the first cell by 10 and output its value as a character. This outputs a newline character (`\\n`).\n8. `-------------`: Decrement the first cell by 13, resulting in -3 (which is not used further).\n9. `..-.`: Output the first cell's value twice (null characters) and decrement it once more.\n10. `<`: Move back to the second cell.\n\nThe visible output of this Brainf*ck code is a newline character. Therefore, the exact output of the code is:\n\n```\n\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
