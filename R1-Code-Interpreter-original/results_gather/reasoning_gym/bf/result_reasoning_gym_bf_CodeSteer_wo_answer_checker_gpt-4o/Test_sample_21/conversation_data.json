    "The given Brainf*ck code is a sequence of commands that manipulate a tape of memory cells, each initially set to zero. Let's break down the code step by step to understand what it does and determine the output:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the first cell.\n4. `+++++++`: Increment the first cell by 7.\n5. `[<+++++++++++++++>-]`: This loop will run 7 times (since the first cell is 7), and it increments the second cell by 15 each time, resulting in the second cell being 105.\n6. `<+.+++++.---..+++++++++++++.<`: \n   - `<`: Move to the first cell.\n   - `+.`: Increment the first cell by 1 and output it (ASCII 8, which is backspace).\n   - `+++++.`: Increment the first cell by 5 (total 6) and output it (ASCII 6, which is ACK).\n   - `---.`: Decrement the first cell by 3 (total 3) and output it (ASCII 3, which is ETX).\n   - `.`: Output the current cell value again (ASCII 3, which is ETX).\n   - `+++++++++++++.`: Increment the first cell by 13 (total 16) and output it (ASCII 16, which is DLE).\n   - `<`: Move to the second cell.\n\nThe output of the Brainf*ck code is a sequence of ASCII characters corresponding to the values in the cells when the `.` command is executed. The exact output is:\n\n```\n\b\u0006\u0003\u0003\u0010\n```\n\nNote: The output consists of non-printable ASCII characters, which may not be visible or may appear differently depending on the environment where it is displayed."

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider the following BF (Brainf*ck) code.
