    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck program, we need to simulate the execution of the code step by step. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a pointer to manipulate data. Here's a brief explanation of the commands:\n\n- `>`: Move the pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n- `[`: Jump forward to the command after the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the command after the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n\nLet's break down the program:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the second cell and set it to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the third cell and set it to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the second cell.\n4. `+++++++`: Increment the second cell to 7.\n5. `[<++++++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply the second cell by 14 and store the result in the first cell. This results in the first cell being 98 (7 * 14).\n6. `<.-`: Move to the first cell, output its value (98, which is 'b'), and decrement it to 97 ('a').\n7. `.`: Output the first cell's value (97, which is 'a').\n8. `+++++++++++++.`: Increment the first cell by 13 to 110 ('n') and output it.\n9. `----.`: Decrement the first cell by 4 to 106 ('j') and output it.\n10. `+++++.<`: Increment the first cell by 5 to 111 ('o'), output it, and move to the second cell.\n\nThe output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands. Let's write the final output:\n\n<<<banjo>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
