    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck program, we need to simulate the execution of the code step by step. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a data pointer to manipulate data. Here's a breakdown of the program:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move the data pointer to the right and set the current cell to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move the data pointer to the right again and set the current cell to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move the data pointer to the left and then to the right, effectively staying in the same position.\n4. `++++++++`: Increment the current cell (cell 2) by 8.\n5. `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: This loop will run 8 times (since the current cell is 8), and each time it will:\n   - Move the data pointer to the left (cell 1).\n   - Increment cell 1 by 13.\n   - Move the data pointer to the right (back to cell 2).\n   - Decrement cell 2 by 1.\n   After the loop, cell 1 will have a value of 104 (8 * 13) and cell 2 will be 0.\n6. `<.`: Move the data pointer to the left (cell 1) and output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in cell 1, which is 104 ('h').\n7. `---`: Decrement cell 1 by 3, making it 101.\n8. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in cell 1, which is 101 ('e').\n9. `++++`: Increment cell 1 by 4, making it 105.\n10. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in cell 1, which is 105 ('i').\n11. `++++++++++`: Increment cell 1 by 10, making it 115.\n12. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in cell 1, which is 115 ('s').\n13. `+`: Increment cell 1 by 1, making it 116.\n14. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in cell 1, which is 116 ('t').\n15. `<`: Move the data pointer to the left (cell 0).\n\nThe output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\nTherefore, the output of the program is:\n\n<<<heist>>>"
