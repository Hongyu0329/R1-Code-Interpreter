    "The given Brainf*ck code can be analyzed step by step to determine its output. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a pointer to manipulate data. Here's a breakdown of the code:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move the pointer to the right and set the current cell to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move the pointer to the right again and set the current cell to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move the pointer left and then right, effectively staying in the same position.\n4. `++++++++`: Increment the current cell (cell 2) by 8.\n5. `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply the value in cell 2 by 13, resulting in 104 in cell 1.\n6. `<.`: Move the pointer left to cell 1 and output the character 'h' (ASCII 104).\n7. `---`: Decrement the current cell (cell 1) by 3, resulting in 101.\n8. `.`: Output the character 'e' (ASCII 101).\n9. `----`: Decrement the current cell (cell 1) by 4, resulting in 97.\n10. `.`: Output the character 'a' (ASCII 97).\n11. `>+++[<+++++++>-]`: Move to cell 2, increment by 3, loop to multiply by 7, resulting in 21 in cell 1.\n12. `<.`: Move to cell 1 and output the character 'u' (ASCII 117).\n13. `>++++[<---->-]`: Move to cell 2, increment by 4, loop to subtract 4, resulting in 0 in cell 1.\n14. `<-.`: Move to cell 1, decrement by 1, resulting in 116, and output the character 't' (ASCII 116).\n15. `<`: Move to cell 0.\n\nThe output of the code is the string \"heat\"."

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider the following BF (Brainf*ck) code.
