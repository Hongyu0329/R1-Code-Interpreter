    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck code, we need to simulate the execution of the code step by step. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a data pointer to manipulate data. Here's a breakdown of the code:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move the data pointer to the right and set the cell to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move the data pointer to the right again and set the cell to 0.\n3. `<`: Move the data pointer back to the left.\n4. `>++++++++++`: Move the data pointer to the right and set the cell to 10.\n5. `[<++++++++++>-]`: Loop to set the previous cell to 100 (10 * 10).\n6. `<++`: Move the data pointer to the left and increment the cell by 2, making it 102.\n7. `.-`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value 102 ('f') and decrement the cell by 1, making it 101.\n8. `+++++++++++++++`: Increment the cell by 15, making it 116.\n9. `.+`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value 116 ('t') and increment the cell by 1, making it 117.\n10. `--`: Decrement the cell by 2, making it 115.\n11. `.<`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value 115 ('s') and move the data pointer to the left.\n\nThe output of the code is the sequence of characters corresponding to the ASCII values 102, 116, and 115, which are 'f', 't', and 's', respectively.\n\nTherefore, the exact output of the code is:\n\n```\nfts\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider the following BF (Brainf*ck) code.
