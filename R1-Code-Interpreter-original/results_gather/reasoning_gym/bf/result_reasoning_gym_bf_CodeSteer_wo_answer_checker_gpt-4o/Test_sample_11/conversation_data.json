    "The given Brainf*ck code is a sequence of commands that manipulate a tape of memory cells, each initially set to zero. Let's break down the code step by step to understand what it does and determine the output:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to zero.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the first cell.\n4. `++++++++`: Increment the first cell by 8.\n5. `[<++++++++++++++>-]`: Loop that multiplies the value in the first cell by 14 and stores it in the second cell. This results in the second cell having a value of 112.\n6. `<.`: Move to the first cell and output its value as a character. The first cell is 0, so it outputs a null character (not visible).\n7. `-----------`: Decrement the second cell by 11, resulting in 101.\n8. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value 101, which is 'e'.\n9. `+++++++++++++`: Increment the second cell by 13, resulting in 114.\n10. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value 114, which is 'r'.\n11. `---------------`: Decrement the second cell by 15, resulting in 99.\n12. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value 99, which is 'c'.\n13. `+++++`: Increment the second cell by 5, resulting in 104.\n14. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value 104, which is 'h'.\n15. `<`: Move to the first cell.\n\nThe output of the Brainf*ck code is the string \"erch\"."

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider the following BF (Brainf*ck) code.
