    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck code, we need to simulate the execution of the code step by step. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a data pointer to manipulate data. Here's a breakdown of the code:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move the pointer to the right and set the cell to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move the pointer to the right again and set the cell to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move the pointer left and then right, effectively staying in the same position.\n4. `++++++++++`: Increment the current cell (cell 2) by 10.\n5. `[<+++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply the value in cell 2 by 11 and store it in cell 1. This results in cell 1 having a value of 110.\n6. `<+.`: Move to cell 0, increment it by 1, and output the character (ASCII 110, 'n').\n7. `------------.`: Decrement the current cell (cell 0) by 12 and output the character (ASCII 98, 'b').\n8. `>++++[<++++>-]<+.`: Move to cell 1, increment it by 4, loop to multiply by 4, resulting in 16, and output the character (ASCII 97, 'a').\n9. `---------------.`: Decrement the current cell (cell 1) by 15 and output the character (ASCII 97, 'a').\n10. `+++++++++++++++.<`: Increment the current cell (cell 1) by 15, output the character (ASCII 110, 'n'), and move left.\n\nThe output of the code is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands. Therefore, the exact output of the code is:\n\n```\nnban\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Consider the following BF (Brainf*ck) code.
