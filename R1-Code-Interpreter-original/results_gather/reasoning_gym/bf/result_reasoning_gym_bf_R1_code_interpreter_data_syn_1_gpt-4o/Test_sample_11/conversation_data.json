    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck code, we need to simulate the execution of the code step by step. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a data pointer to manipulate data. The commands are as follows:\n\n- `>`: Move the data pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the data pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n- `[`: Jump forward to the command after the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the command after the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n- `,`: Input a byte and store it in the byte at the data pointer (not used in this code).\n\nLet's break down the code:\n\n1. `[-]`: Set the current cell to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the first cell and then to the second cell.\n4. `++++++++`: Increment the second cell to 8.\n5. `[<++++++++++++++>-]`: This loop will run 8 times (since the second cell is 8), incrementing the first cell by 14 each time, resulting in the first cell being 112 (8 * 14).\n6. `<`: Move to the first cell.\n7. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value 112, which is 'p'.\n8. `-----------`: Decrement the first cell by 11, resulting in 101.\n9. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value 101, which is 'e'.\n10. `+++++++++++++`: Increment the first cell by 13, resulting in 114.\n11. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value 114, which is 'r'.\n12. `---------------`: Decrement the first cell by 15, resulting in 99.\n13. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value 99, which is 'c'.\n14. `+++++`: Increment the first cell by 5, resulting in 104.\n15. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value 104, which is 'h'.\n16. `<`: Move to the second cell (not necessary for output).\n\nThe expected output is the sequence of characters 'perch'. Let's confirm this by simulating the code execution using Python.\n\n```python\ndef brainfuck_interpreter(code):\n    tape = [0] * 30000\n    pointer = 0\n    code_pointer = 0\n    output = []\n    loop_stack = []\n\n    while code_pointer < len(code):\n        command = code[code_pointer]\n\n        if command == '>':\n            pointer += 1\n        elif command == '<':\n            pointer -= 1\n        elif command == '+':\n            tape[pointer] = (tape[pointer] + 1) % 256\n        elif command == '-':\n            tape[pointer] = (tape[pointer] - 1) % 256\n        elif command == '.':\n            output.append(chr(tape[pointer]))\n        elif command == '[':\n            if tape[pointer] == 0:\n                open_brackets = 1\n                while open_brackets != 0:\n                    code_pointer += 1\n                    if code[code_pointer] == '[':\n                        open_brackets += 1\n                    elif code[code_pointer] == ']':\n                        open_brackets -= 1\n            else:\n                loop_stack.append(code_pointer)\n        elif command == ']':\n            if tape[pointer] != 0:\n                code_pointer = loop_stack[-1]\n            else:\n                loop_stack.pop()\n\n        code_pointer += 1\n\n    return ''.join(output)\n\nbf_code = \"[-]>[-]<>++++++++[<++++++++++++++>-]<.-----------.+++++++++++++.---------------.+++++.<\"\nprint(brainfuck_interpreter(bf_code))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the output.",
