    "To solve this problem, we need to interpret the given Brainf*ck code. Brainf*ck is an esoteric programming language that uses a minimalistic set of commands to manipulate an array of memory cells, each initially set to zero. The commands are:\n\n- `>`: Move the pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the memory cell at the pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the memory cell at the pointer.\n- `[`: Jump past the matching `]` if the cell at the pointer is 0.\n- `]`: Jump back to the matching `[` if the cell at the pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the character at the memory cell at the pointer.\n- `,`: Input a character and store it in the memory cell at the pointer (not used in this program).\n\nLet's break down the given program step by step:\n\n1. `[-]`: Set the current cell to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the first cell.\n4. `++++++++`: Increment the first cell to 8.\n5. `[<++++++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply the first cell by 14, resulting in 112 in the second cell.\n6. `<++.`: Move to the first cell, increment twice (to 10), and output (newline character).\n7. `>++++[<---->-]`: Move to the second cell, increment by 4 (116), and subtract 4 in a loop, resulting in 112.\n8. `<-.`: Move to the first cell, decrement (9), and output (tab character).\n9. `++++++++++++.`: Increment the first cell to 21 and output (U).\n10. `--------.`: Decrement the first cell to 13 and output (M).\n11. `+++++++++.`: Increment the first cell to 22 and output (V).\n12. `<`: Move to the first cell.\n\nNow, let's execute the code to see the output.\n\n```python\ndef brainfuck_interpreter(code):\n    tape = [0] * 30000\n    pointer = 0\n    code_pointer = 0\n    output = []\n    loop_stack = []\n\n    while code_pointer < len(code):\n        command = code[code_pointer]\n\n        if command == '>':\n            pointer += 1\n        elif command == '<':\n            pointer -= 1\n        elif command == '+':\n            tape[pointer] = (tape[pointer] + 1) % 256\n        elif command == '-':\n            tape[pointer] = (tape[pointer] - 1) % 256\n        elif command == '.':\n            output.append(chr(tape[pointer]))\n        elif command == '[':\n            if tape[pointer] == 0:\n                open_brackets = 1\n                while open_brackets != 0:\n                    code_pointer += 1\n                    if code[code_pointer] == '[':\n                        open_brackets += 1\n                    elif code[code_pointer] == ']':\n                        open_brackets -= 1\n            else:\n                loop_stack.append(code_pointer)\n        elif command == ']':\n            if tape[pointer] != 0:\n                code_pointer = loop_stack[-1]\n            else:\n                loop_stack.pop()\n\n        code_pointer += 1\n\n    return ''.join(output)\n\ncode = \"[-]>[-]<>++++++++[<++++++++++++++>-]<++.>++++[<---->-]<-.++++++++++++.--------.+++++++++.<\"\noutput = brainfuck_interpreter(code)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the output.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    This is a BF (Brainf*ck) computer program.
