    "To solve this problem, we need to interpret the given Brainf*ck code. Brainf*ck is an esoteric programming language that uses a minimalistic set of commands to manipulate an array of memory cells, each initially set to zero. The commands are:\n\n- `>`: Move the pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the memory cell at the pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the memory cell at the pointer.\n- `[`: Jump past the matching `]` if the cell at the pointer is 0.\n- `]`: Jump back to the matching `[` if the cell at the pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the character at the memory cell at the pointer.\n- `,`: Input a character and store it in the memory cell at the pointer.\n\nLet's break down the given program:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the second cell and set it to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the third cell and set it to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the second cell.\n4. `++++++++++`: Set the second cell to 10.\n5. `[<++++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply the value in the second cell by 12 and store it in the first cell. This results in the first cell having a value of 120.\n6. `<-.`: Move to the first cell, decrement it to 119, and output the character 'w'.\n7. `--------`: Decrement the first cell by 8 to 111.\n8. `.`: Output the character 'o'.\n9. `+++`: Increment the first cell by 3 to 114.\n10. `.`: Output the character 'r'.\n11. `.`: Output the character 'r' again.\n12. `+++++++`: Increment the first cell by 7 to 121.\n13. `.`: Output the character 'y'.\n14. `<`: Move to the second cell.\n15. `.`: Output the character corresponding to 10, which is a newline.\n\nNow, let's execute the code to confirm the output.\n\n```python\ndef brainfuck_interpreter(code):\n    tape = [0] * 30000\n    pointer = 0\n    code_pointer = 0\n    output = []\n    loop_stack = []\n\n    while code_pointer < len(code):\n        command = code[code_pointer]\n\n        if command == '>':\n            pointer += 1\n        elif command == '<':\n            pointer -= 1\n        elif command == '+':\n            tape[pointer] = (tape[pointer] + 1) % 256\n        elif command == '-':\n            tape[pointer] = (tape[pointer] - 1) % 256\n        elif command == '.':\n            output.append(chr(tape[pointer]))\n        elif command == ',':\n            pass  # No input handling\n        elif command == '[':\n            if tape[pointer] == 0:\n                open_brackets = 1\n                while open_brackets != 0:\n                    code_pointer += 1\n                    if code[code_pointer] == '[':\n                        open_brackets += 1\n                    elif code[code_pointer] == ']':\n                        open_brackets -= 1\n            else:\n                loop_stack.append(code_pointer)\n        elif command == ']':\n            if tape[pointer] != 0:\n                code_pointer = loop_stack[-1]\n            else:\n                loop_stack.pop()\n\n        code_pointer += 1\n\n    return ''.join(output)\n\ncode = \">[-]>[-]<>++++++++++[<++++++++++++>-]<-.--------.+++..+++++++.<\"\nprint(brainfuck_interpreter(code))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the output.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
