    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck program, we need to simulate the execution of the code. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a pointer to manipulate data. The commands are as follows:\n\n- `>`: Move the pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n- `[`: Jump forward to the command after the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the command after the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n- `,`: Input a byte and store it in the byte at the data pointer (not used in this program).\n\nLet's break down the program step by step:\n\n1. `[-]`: Set the current cell to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the first cell.\n4. `++++++++`: Increment the first cell to 8.\n5. `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply the first cell by 13, resulting in 104 in the second cell.\n6. `<-.`: Decrement the first cell to 7 and output it as a character (ASCII 7 is a control character).\n7. `+++++.`: Increment the first cell to 12 and output it as a character (ASCII 12 is a control character).\n8. `-----------.`: Decrement the first cell to 3 and output it as a character (ASCII 3 is a control character).\n9. `>+++[<++++++>-]`: Move to the second cell, increment it to 107, and loop to multiply by 6, resulting in 642.\n10. `<..`: Move back to the first cell and output it twice (ASCII 3 is a control character).\n\nThe program involves control characters, which are non-printable. To see the output, we need to simulate the program using Python.\n\n```python\ndef brainfuck_interpreter(code):\n    tape = [0] * 30000\n    pointer = 0\n    code_pointer = 0\n    output = []\n    loop_stack = []\n\n    while code_pointer < len(code):\n        command = code[code_pointer]\n\n        if command == '>':\n            pointer += 1\n        elif command == '<':\n            pointer -= 1\n        elif command == '+':\n            tape[pointer] = (tape[pointer] + 1) % 256\n        elif command == '-':\n            tape[pointer] = (tape[pointer] - 1) % 256\n        elif command == '.':\n            output.append(chr(tape[pointer]))\n        elif command == '[':\n            if tape[pointer] == 0:\n                open_brackets = 1\n                while open_brackets != 0:\n                    code_pointer += 1\n                    if code[code_pointer] == '[':\n                        open_brackets += 1\n                    elif code[code_pointer] == ']':\n                        open_brackets -= 1\n            else:\n                loop_stack.append(code_pointer)\n        elif command == ']':\n            if tape[pointer] != 0:\n                code_pointer = loop_stack[-1]\n            else:\n                loop_stack.pop()\n\n        code_pointer += 1\n\n    return ''.join(output)\n\nprogram = \"[-]>[-]<>++++++++[<+++++++++++++>-]<-.+++++.-----------.>+++[<++++++>-]<..\"\noutput = brainfuck_interpreter(program)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the output.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
