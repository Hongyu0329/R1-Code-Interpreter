    "To solve this problem, we need to interpret the given Brainf*ck code. Brainf*ck is an esoteric programming language that uses a minimalistic set of commands to manipulate an array of memory cells, each initially set to zero. The commands are:\n\n- `>`: Move the pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the memory cell at the pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the memory cell at the pointer.\n- `.`: Output the character at the memory cell at the pointer.\n- `,`: Input a character and store it in the memory cell at the pointer.\n- `[`: Jump past the matching `]` if the cell at the pointer is 0.\n- `]`: Jump back to the matching `[` if the cell at the pointer is nonzero.\n\nLet's break down the given program step by step:\n\n1. `[-]`: Set the current cell to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the first cell and then to the second cell.\n4. `+++++++++`: Increment the second cell to 9.\n5. `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply the value in the second cell by 13 and store it in the first cell. This results in the first cell having a value of 117 (9 * 13).\n6. `<--`: Move to the first cell and decrement it twice, resulting in 115.\n7. `.`: Output the character corresponding to ASCII value 115, which is 's'.\n8. `--------`: Decrement the first cell by 8, resulting in 107.\n9. `.`: Output the character corresponding to ASCII value 107, which is 'k'.\n10. `--`: Decrement the first cell by 2, resulting in 105.\n11. `.`: Output the character corresponding to ASCII value 105, which is 'i'.\n12. `----`: Decrement the first cell by 4, resulting in 101.\n13. `.`: Output the character corresponding to ASCII value 101, which is 'e'.\n14. `+++++++++++++`: Increment the first cell by 13, resulting in 114.\n15. `.`: Output the character corresponding to ASCII value 114, which is 'r'.\n16. `<`: Move to the second cell.\n17. `.`: Output the character corresponding to ASCII value 9, which is a tab character.\n\nNow, let's execute the code to confirm the output:\n\n```python\ndef brainfuck_interpreter(code):\n    tape = [0] * 30000\n    pointer = 0\n    code_pointer = 0\n    output = []\n    loop_stack = []\n\n    while code_pointer < len(code):\n        command = code[code_pointer]\n\n        if command == '>':\n            pointer += 1\n        elif command == '<':\n            pointer -= 1\n        elif command == '+':\n            tape[pointer] = (tape[pointer] + 1) % 256\n        elif command == '-':\n            tape[pointer] = (tape[pointer] - 1) % 256\n        elif command == '.':\n            output.append(chr(tape[pointer]))\n        elif command == ',':\n            pass  # No input handling\n        elif command == '[':\n            if tape[pointer] == 0:\n                open_brackets = 1\n                while open_brackets != 0:\n                    code_pointer += 1\n                    if code[code_pointer] == '[':\n                        open_brackets += 1\n                    elif code[code_pointer] == ']':\n                        open_brackets -= 1\n            else:\n                loop_stack.append(code_pointer)\n        elif command == ']':\n            if tape[pointer] != 0:\n                code_pointer = loop_stack[-1]\n            else:\n                loop_stack.pop()\n\n        code_pointer += 1\n\n    return ''.join(output)\n\nprogram = \"[-]>[-]<>+++++++++[<+++++++++++++>-]<--.--------.--.----.+++++++++++++.<\"\nprint(brainfuck_interpreter(program))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the output.",
