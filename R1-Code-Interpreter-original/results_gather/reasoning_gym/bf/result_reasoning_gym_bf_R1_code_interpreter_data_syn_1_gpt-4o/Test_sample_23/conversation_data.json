    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck program, we need to simulate its execution. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a pointer to manipulate data. The commands are as follows:\n\n- `>`: Move the pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n- `[`: Jump forward to the command after the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the command after the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n\nLet's break down the program step by step:\n\n1. `[-]`: Set the current cell to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the first cell and then to the second cell.\n4. `++++++++`: Increment the second cell to 8.\n5. `[<++++++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply the value in the second cell by 14 and store it in the first cell. This results in the first cell having a value of 112 (8 * 14).\n6. `<.`: Move to the first cell and output its value as a character, which is 'p' (ASCII 112).\n7. `++.`: Increment the first cell to 114 and output 'r' (ASCII 114).\n8. `---------.`: Decrement the first cell to 105 and output 'i' (ASCII 105).\n9. `++++.`: Increment the first cell to 109 and output 'm' (ASCII 109).\n10. `++.`: Increment the first cell to 111 and output 'o' (ASCII 111).\n11. `<`: Move to the second cell.\n\nNow, let's execute the code to confirm the output:\n\n```python\n# Brainf*ck interpreter for the given program\ndef brainfuck_interpreter(program):\n    tape = [0] * 30000\n    pointer = 0\n    pc = 0\n    output = []\n    loop_stack = []\n\n    while pc < len(program):\n        command = program[pc]\n\n        if command == '>':\n            pointer += 1\n        elif command == '<':\n            pointer -= 1\n        elif command == '+':\n            tape[pointer] = (tape[pointer] + 1) % 256\n        elif command == '-':\n            tape[pointer] = (tape[pointer] - 1) % 256\n        elif command == '.':\n            output.append(chr(tape[pointer]))\n        elif command == '[':\n            if tape[pointer] == 0:\n                open_brackets = 1\n                while open_brackets != 0:\n                    pc += 1\n                    if program[pc] == '[':\n                        open_brackets += 1\n                    elif program[pc] == ']':\n                        open_brackets -= 1\n            else:\n                loop_stack.append(pc)\n        elif command == ']':\n            if tape[pointer] != 0:\n                pc = loop_stack[-1]\n            else:\n                loop_stack.pop()\n\n        pc += 1\n\n    return ''.join(output)\n\nprogram = \"[-]>[-]<>++++++++[<++++++++++++++>-]<.++.---------.++++.++.<\"\noutput = brainfuck_interpreter(program)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the output of the Brainf*ck program.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
