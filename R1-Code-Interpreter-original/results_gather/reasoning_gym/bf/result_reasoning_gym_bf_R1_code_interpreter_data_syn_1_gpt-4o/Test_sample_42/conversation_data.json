    "To solve this problem, we need to interpret the given Brainf*ck code. Brainf*ck is an esoteric programming language that uses a minimalistic set of commands to manipulate a memory tape of cells, each initially set to zero. The commands are:\n\n- `>`: Move the pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the memory cell at the pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the memory cell at the pointer.\n- `[`: Jump past the matching `]` if the cell at the pointer is 0.\n- `]`: Jump back to the matching `[` if the cell at the pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the character at the cell at the pointer.\n- `,`: Input a character and store it in the cell at the pointer (not used in this program).\n\nLet's break down the program step by step:\n\n1. `[-]`: Set the current cell to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the first cell.\n4. `++++++++[<++++++++++++>-]`: This loop sets the first cell to 64 (8 * 8).\n5. `<+.`: Move back to the first cell, increment it by 1 (making it 65), and output it as a character ('A').\n6. `>++++[<++++++>-]`: Move to the second cell, set it to 24 (4 * 6).\n7. `<-.`: Move back to the first cell, decrement it by 1 (making it 64), and output it as a character ('@').\n8. `---------------`: Decrement the first cell by 15 (making it 49).\n9. `.`: Output the character at the first cell ('1').\n10. `++++++`: Increment the first cell by 6 (making it 55).\n11. `.`: Output the character at the first cell ('7').\n12. `-`: Decrement the first cell by 1 (making it 54).\n13. `.`: Output the character at the first cell ('6').\n14. `<`: Move back to the first cell.\n\nNow, let's execute the code to see the output:\n\n```python\ndef brainfuck_interpreter(code):\n    tape = [0] * 30000\n    pointer = 0\n    code_pointer = 0\n    output = []\n    loop_stack = []\n\n    while code_pointer < len(code):\n        command = code[code_pointer]\n\n        if command == '>':\n            pointer += 1\n        elif command == '<':\n            pointer -= 1\n        elif command == '+':\n            tape[pointer] = (tape[pointer] + 1) % 256\n        elif command == '-':\n            tape[pointer] = (tape[pointer] - 1) % 256\n        elif command == '.':\n            output.append(chr(tape[pointer]))\n        elif command == '[':\n            if tape[pointer] == 0:\n                open_brackets = 1\n                while open_brackets != 0:\n                    code_pointer += 1\n                    if code[code_pointer] == '[':\n                        open_brackets += 1\n                    elif code[code_pointer] == ']':\n                        open_brackets -= 1\n            else:\n                loop_stack.append(code_pointer)\n        elif command == ']':\n            if tape[pointer] != 0:\n                code_pointer = loop_stack[-1]\n            else:\n                loop_stack.pop()\n\n        code_pointer += 1\n\n    return ''.join(output)\n\ncode = \"[-]>[-]<>++++++++[<++++++++++++>-]<+.>++++[<++++++>-]<-.---------------.++++++.-.<\"\nprint(brainfuck_interpreter(code))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the output.",

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
