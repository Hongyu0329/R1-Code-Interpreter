    "To solve this problem, we need to interpret the given Brainf*ck code. Brainf*ck is an esoteric programming language that uses a minimalistic set of commands to manipulate an array of memory cells, each initially set to zero. The commands are:\n\n- `>`: Move the pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the memory cell at the pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the memory cell at the pointer.\n- `[`: Jump past the matching `]` if the cell at the pointer is 0.\n- `]`: Jump back to the matching `[` if the cell at the pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the character at the cell at the pointer.\n- `,`: Input a character and store it in the cell at the pointer (not used in this program).\n\nLet's break down the program step by step:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the second cell and set it to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the third cell and set it to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the second cell.\n4. `+++++++`: Increment the second cell to 7.\n5. `[<+++++++++++++++>-]`: This loop will run 7 times, incrementing the first cell by 15 each time, resulting in the first cell being 105 (7 * 15).\n6. `<.+++++.-------.++++++++.+++++.<`: \n   - `<.`: Move to the first cell and output its value as a character (ASCII 105 is 'i').\n   - `+++++`: Increment the first cell to 110.\n   - `-------`: Decrement the first cell to 103.\n   - `.`: Output the character at the first cell (ASCII 103 is 'g').\n   - `++++++++`: Increment the first cell to 111.\n   - `.`: Output the character at the first cell (ASCII 111 is 'o').\n   - `+++++`: Increment the first cell to 116.\n   - `.`: Output the character at the first cell (ASCII 116 is 't').\n   - `<`: Move back to the second cell (not used further).\n\nNow, let's execute the code to confirm the output:\n\n```python\n# Brainf*ck interpreter for the given program\ndef brainfuck_interpreter(code):\n    memory = [0] * 30000\n    pointer = 0\n    code_pointer = 0\n    output = []\n    \n    while code_pointer < len(code):\n        command = code[code_pointer]\n        \n        if command == '>':\n            pointer += 1\n        elif command == '<':\n            pointer -= 1\n        elif command == '+':\n            memory[pointer] += 1\n        elif command == '-':\n            memory[pointer] -= 1\n        elif command == '.':\n            output.append(chr(memory[pointer]))\n        elif command == '[':\n            if memory[pointer] == 0:\n                open_brackets = 1\n                while open_brackets != 0:\n                    code_pointer += 1\n                    if code[code_pointer] == '[':\n                        open_brackets += 1\n                    elif code[code_pointer] == ']':\n                        open_brackets -= 1\n        elif command == ']':\n            if memory[pointer] != 0:\n                close_brackets = 1\n                while close_brackets != 0:\n                    code_pointer -= 1\n                    if code[code_pointer] == '[':\n                        close_brackets -= 1\n                    elif code[code_pointer] == ']':\n                        close_brackets += 1\n        \n        code_pointer += 1\n    \n    return ''.join(output)\n\n# Given Brainf*ck program\nprogram = \">[-]>[-]<>+++++++[<+++++++++++++++>-]<.+++++.-------.++++++++.+++++.<\"\noutput = brainfuck_interpreter(program)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the output.",
