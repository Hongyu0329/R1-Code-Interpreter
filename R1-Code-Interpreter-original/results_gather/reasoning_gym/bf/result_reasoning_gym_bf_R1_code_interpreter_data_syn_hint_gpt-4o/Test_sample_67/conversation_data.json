    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck code, we need to simulate its execution step by step. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a data pointer to manipulate data. Here's a breakdown of the code:\n\n1. `[-]` - This loop sets the current cell to 0. It decrements the value at the current cell until it reaches 0.\n2. `>` - Move the data pointer to the right.\n3. `[-]` - Again, set the current cell to 0.\n4. `<` - Move the data pointer to the left.\n5. `>` - Move the data pointer to the right.\n6. `++++++++++` - Increment the current cell's value by 10.\n7. `[<+++++++++++>-]` - This loop multiplies the value in the current cell by 13 and stores it in the previous cell. It effectively sets the previous cell to 130.\n8. `<` - Move the data pointer to the left.\n9. `+` - Increment the current cell's value by 1, making it 131.\n10. `.` - Output the ASCII character corresponding to the value 131.\n11. `--` - Decrement the current cell's value by 2, making it 129.\n12. `.` - Output the ASCII character corresponding to the value 129.\n13. `--------` - Decrement the current cell's value by 8, making it 121.\n14. `.` - Output the ASCII character corresponding to the value 121.\n15. `++` - Increment the current cell's value by 2, making it 123.\n16. `.` - Output the ASCII character corresponding to the value 123.\n17. `------` - Decrement the current cell's value by 6, making it 117.\n18. `.` - Output the ASCII character corresponding to the value 117.\n19. `<` - Move the data pointer to the left.\n\nNow, let's determine the ASCII characters for these values:\n\n- 131: This is a non-standard ASCII value, but in extended ASCII, it corresponds to 'ƒ'.\n- 129: This is also a non-standard ASCII value, corresponding to 'ü' in extended ASCII.\n- 121: This corresponds to 'y'.\n- 123: This corresponds to '{'.\n- 117: This corresponds to 'u'.\n\nTherefore, the output of the Brainf*ck code is the sequence of these characters. \n\nThe final output is:\n\n<<<'ƒüy{u'>>>"
