    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck code, we need to simulate its execution. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a pointer to manipulate data. Here's a breakdown of the code:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move the pointer to the right and set the cell to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move the pointer to the right again and set the cell to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move the pointer left and then right, effectively staying in the same position.\n4. `++++++++++`: Increment the current cell (cell 2) by 10.\n5. `[<+++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply the value in cell 2 by 11 and store it in cell 1. This results in cell 1 having a value of 110.\n6. `<+.`: Move to cell 0, increment it by 1, and output the character (ASCII 110, 'n').\n7. `------------`: Decrement the current cell (cell 0) by 12, resulting in a value of 98.\n8. `.`: Output the character (ASCII 98, 'b').\n9. `>++++[<++++>-]<+.`: Move to cell 1, increment it by 4, loop to multiply by 4, and increment by 1, resulting in a value of 17. Output the character (ASCII 17, non-printable).\n10. `---------------`: Decrement the current cell (cell 1) by 15, resulting in a value of 2.\n11. `.`: Output the character (ASCII 2, non-printable).\n12. `+++++++++++++++`: Increment the current cell (cell 1) by 15, resulting in a value of 17.\n13. `.`: Output the character (ASCII 17, non-printable).\n14. `<`: Move to cell 0.\n\nThe output of the code is a sequence of characters based on the ASCII values of the cells when the `.` command is executed. The printable characters are 'n' and 'b', while the others are non-printable.\n\nTherefore, the exact output of the code is:\n\n```\nnb\n```\n\n<<<'nb'>>>"
