    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck code, we need to simulate its execution step by step. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a data pointer to manipulate data. Here's a breakdown of the code:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move the pointer to the right and set the cell to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move the pointer to the right again and set the cell to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move the pointer left and then right, effectively staying in the same position.\n4. `++++++++`: Increment the current cell (cell 2) by 8.\n5. `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: This loop will multiply the value in the current cell (8) by 13, resulting in 104 in cell 1.\n6. `<.`: Move the pointer left to cell 1 and output the character corresponding to the ASCII value 104, which is 'h'.\n7. `+++++++++++++.`: Increment the current cell (cell 1) by 13, resulting in 117, and output the character 'u'.\n8. `---..`: Decrement the current cell by 3, resulting in 114, and output the character 'r' twice.\n9. `+++++++.`: Increment the current cell by 7, resulting in 121, and output the character 'y'.\n10. `<`: Move the pointer left to cell 0.\n\nThe output of the code is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands. Let's summarize the output:\n\n- 'h' from ASCII 104\n- 'u' from ASCII 117\n- 'r' from ASCII 114\n- 'r' from ASCII 114\n- 'y' from ASCII 121\n\nTherefore, the output of the Brainf*ck code is:\n\n<<<'hurry'>>>"
