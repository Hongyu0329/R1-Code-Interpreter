    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck code, we need to simulate its execution step by step. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a data pointer to manipulate data. Here's a breakdown of the code:\n\n1. `[-]` - This loop sets the current cell to 0. It decrements the value at the current cell until it reaches 0.\n2. `>` - Move the data pointer to the right.\n3. `[-]` - Again, this loop sets the current cell to 0.\n4. `<` - Move the data pointer to the left.\n5. `>` - Move the data pointer to the right.\n6. `++++++++++` - Increment the current cell's value by 10.\n7. `[<++++++++++>-]` - This loop multiplies the value in the current cell by 10 and stores it in the previous cell. It effectively sets the previous cell to 100.\n8. `<` - Move the data pointer to the left (to the cell with value 100).\n9. `.` - Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in the current cell (100, which is 'd').\n10. `+++++` - Increment the current cell's value by 5 (making it 105).\n11. `.` - Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in the current cell (105, which is 'i').\n12. `+++++++++` - Increment the current cell's value by 9 (making it 114).\n13. `.` - Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in the current cell (114, which is 'r').\n14. `++` - Increment the current cell's value by 2 (making it 116).\n15. `.` - Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in the current cell (116, which is 't').\n16. `+++++` - Increment the current cell's value by 5 (making it 121).\n17. `.` - Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in the current cell (121, which is 'y').\n18. `<` - Move the data pointer to the left (to the cell with value 0).\n\nThe output of the code is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands. Let's compile the output:\n\n- 'd'\n- 'i'\n- 'r'\n- 't'\n- 'y'\n\nTherefore, the output of the Brainf*ck code is:\n\n<<<'dirty'>>>"
