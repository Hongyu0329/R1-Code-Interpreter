    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck program, we need to simulate its execution. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a pointer to manipulate data. The commands are as follows:\n\n- `>`: Move the pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n- `[`: Jump forward to the command after the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the command after the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n\nLet's break down the program step by step:\n\n1. `[-]`: Set the current cell to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the first cell and then to the second cell.\n4. `+++++++++`: Increment the second cell to 9.\n5. `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: Loop to increment the first cell by 13, nine times (9 * 13 = 117).\n6. `<--`: Move to the first cell and decrement it twice (117 - 2 = 115).\n7. `.`: Output the character represented by ASCII 115, which is 's'.\n8. `-----------`: Decrement the first cell by 11 (115 - 11 = 104).\n9. `.`: Output the character represented by ASCII 104, which is 'h'.\n10. `-------`: Decrement the first cell by 7 (104 - 7 = 97).\n11. `.`: Output the character represented by ASCII 97, which is 'a'.\n12. `++++++++++++`: Increment the first cell by 12 (97 + 12 = 109).\n13. `.`: Output the character represented by ASCII 109, which is 'm'.\n14. `--------`: Decrement the first cell by 8 (109 - 8 = 101).\n15. `.`: Output the character represented by ASCII 101, which is 'e'.\n16. `.<`: Move to the second cell and output the character represented by ASCII 0, which is a null character (not visible).\n\nThe visible output of the program is \"shame\".\n\nTherefore, the output of the program is:\n\n<<<shame>>>"
