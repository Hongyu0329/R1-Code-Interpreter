    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck code, we need to simulate its execution step by step. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a data pointer to manipulate data. Here's a breakdown of the code:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move the pointer to the right and set the cell to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move the pointer to the right again and set the cell to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move the pointer left and then right, effectively staying in the same position.\n4. `++++++++`: Increment the current cell (cell 2) by 8.\n5. `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: This loop will run 8 times, each time moving left, incrementing the left cell by 13, moving right, and decrementing the current cell. This results in cell 1 having a value of 104 (8 * 13).\n6. `<`: Move the pointer to the left (to cell 1).\n7. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in cell 1, which is 104 ('h').\n8. `---`: Decrement the current cell (cell 1) by 3, resulting in 101.\n9. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in cell 1, which is 101 ('e').\n10. `+++++++++`: Increment the current cell (cell 1) by 9, resulting in 110.\n11. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in cell 1, which is 110 ('n').\n12. `-----------`: Decrement the current cell (cell 1) by 11, resulting in 99.\n13. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in cell 1, which is 99 ('c').\n14. `++`: Increment the current cell (cell 1) by 2, resulting in 101.\n15. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the ASCII value in cell 1, which is 101 ('e').\n16. `<`: Move the pointer to the left (to cell 0).\n\nThe output of the code is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\nTherefore, the output of the given Brainf*ck code is:\n\n<<<'hence'>>>"
