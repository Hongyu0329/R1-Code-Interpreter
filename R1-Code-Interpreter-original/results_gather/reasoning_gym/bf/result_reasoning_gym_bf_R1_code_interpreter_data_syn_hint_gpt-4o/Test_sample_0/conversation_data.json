    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck program, we need to simulate its execution. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a pointer to manipulate data. Here's a breakdown of the program:\n\n1. `[-]` - Sets the current cell to 0.\n2. `>` - Move to the next cell.\n3. `[-]` - Sets the current cell to 0.\n4. `<` - Move back to the previous cell.\n5. `>++++++++` - Move to the next cell and increment it by 8.\n6. `[<+++++++++++++>-]` - Loop: Move back, increment by 13, move forward, decrement. This loop runs 8 times, resulting in the first cell being set to 104.\n7. `<.` - Move back to the first cell and output its value as a character ('h').\n8. `---` - Decrement the first cell by 3 (104 - 3 = 101).\n9. `.` - Output the value as a character ('e').\n10. `++++` - Increment the first cell by 4 (101 + 4 = 105).\n11. `.` - Output the value as a character ('i').\n12. `++++++++++` - Increment the first cell by 10 (105 + 10 = 115).\n13. `.` - Output the value as a character ('s').\n14. `+` - Increment the first cell by 1 (115 + 1 = 116).\n15. `.` - Output the value as a character ('t').\n16. `<` - Move back to the previous cell.\n17. `.` - Output the value of the second cell, which is 0, as a character (null character, often not visible).\n\nNow, let's execute the program to confirm the output:\n\n```python\n# Brainf*ck interpreter to execute the given program\ndef brainfuck_interpreter(code):\n    tape = [0] * 30000\n    pointer = 0\n    code_pointer = 0\n    output = []\n    loop_stack = []\n\n    while code_pointer < len(code):\n        command = code[code_pointer]\n\n        if command == '>':\n            pointer += 1\n        elif command == '<':\n            pointer -= 1\n        elif command == '+':\n            tape[pointer] = (tape[pointer] + 1) % 256\n        elif command == '-':\n            tape[pointer] = (tape[pointer] - 1) % 256\n        elif command == '.':\n            output.append(chr(tape[pointer]))\n        elif command == ',':\n            pass  # No input handling\n        elif command == '[':\n            if tape[pointer] == 0:\n                open_brackets = 1\n                while open_brackets != 0:\n                    code_pointer += 1\n                    if code[code_pointer] == '[':\n                        open_brackets += 1\n                    elif code[code_pointer] == ']':\n                        open_brackets -= 1\n            else:\n                loop_stack.append(code_pointer)\n        elif command == ']':\n            if tape[pointer] != 0:\n                code_pointer = loop_stack[-1]\n            else:\n                loop_stack.pop()\n\n        code_pointer += 1\n\n    return ''.join(output)\n\nprogram = \"[-]>[-]<>++++++++[<+++++++++++++>-]<.---.++++.++++++++++.+.<\"\noutput = brainfuck_interpreter(program)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the output of the Brainf*ck program.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the Brainf*ck program outputs the string \"heist\". This matches the expected output based on the step-by-step reasoning of the program's execution.\n\nTherefore, the final output of the Brainf*ck program is:\n\n<<<'heist'>>>"
