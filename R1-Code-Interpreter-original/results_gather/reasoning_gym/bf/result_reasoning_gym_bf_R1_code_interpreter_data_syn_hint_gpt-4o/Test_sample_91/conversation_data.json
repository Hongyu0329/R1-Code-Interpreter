    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck code, we need to simulate its execution step by step. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a data pointer to manipulate data. Here's a breakdown of the code:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move the pointer to the right and set the cell to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move the pointer to the right again and set the cell to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move the pointer left and then right, effectively staying in the same position.\n4. `++++++++`: Increment the current cell (cell 2) by 8.\n5. `[<++++++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply the value in cell 2 by 14 and store it in cell 1. This results in cell 1 having a value of 112 (8 * 14).\n6. `<.-`: Move to cell 1, output its value as a character (ASCII 112 is 'p'), and decrement it.\n7. `------`: Decrement the current cell (cell 1) by 6, resulting in 105 (ASCII 'i').\n8. `.`: Output the current cell as a character ('i').\n9. `+++++`: Increment the current cell (cell 1) by 5, resulting in 110 (ASCII 'n').\n10. `.`: Output the current cell as a character ('n').\n11. `++++++`: Increment the current cell (cell 1) by 6, resulting in 116 (ASCII 't').\n12. `.`: Output the current cell as a character ('t').\n13. `<`: Move to cell 0.\n14. `.`: Output the current cell as a character (cell 0 is 0, ASCII 0 is a non-printable character).\n\nThe output of the code is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands. Let's summarize the output:\n\n- First character: 'p'\n- Second character: 'i'\n- Third character: 'n'\n- Fourth character: 't'\n- Fifth character: Non-printable character (ASCII 0)\n\nThe visible output is \"pint\" followed by a non-printable character.\n\n<<<'pint'>>>"
