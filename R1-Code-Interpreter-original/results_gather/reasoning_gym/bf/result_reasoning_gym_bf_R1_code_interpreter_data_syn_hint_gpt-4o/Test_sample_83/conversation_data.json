    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck program, we need to simulate its execution. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a pointer to manipulate data. The commands are as follows:\n\n- `>`: Move the pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n- `[`: Jump forward to the command after the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the command after the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n\nLet's break down the program step by step:\n\n1. `[-]`: Set the current cell to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the first cell and then to the second cell.\n4. `+++++++++`: Increment the second cell to 9.\n5. `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply the first cell by 13 and store the result in the first cell.\n6. `<--`: Move to the first cell and decrement it twice.\n7. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the value in the first cell.\n8. `-----------`: Decrement the first cell by 11.\n9. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the value in the first cell.\n10. `-------`: Decrement the first cell by 7.\n11. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the value in the first cell.\n12. `+++++++++++`: Increment the first cell by 11.\n13. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the value in the first cell.\n14. `++++++++`: Increment the first cell by 8.\n15. `.`: Output the character corresponding to the value in the first cell.\n16. `<`: Move to the second cell.\n\nNow, let's simulate this program using Python to find the output.\n\n```python\n# Initialize memory tape and pointer\ntape = [0] * 30000\npointer = 0\n\n# Execute the Brainf*ck program\ntape[pointer] = 0\npointer += 1\ntape[pointer] = 0\npointer -= 1\npointer += 1\ntape[pointer] += 9\nwhile tape[pointer] != 0:\n    pointer -= 1\n    tape[pointer] += 13\n    pointer += 1\n    tape[pointer] -= 1\npointer -= 1\ntape[pointer] -= 2\noutput = []\noutput.append(chr(tape[pointer]))\ntape[pointer] -= 11\noutput.append(chr(tape[pointer]))\ntape[pointer] -= 7\noutput.append(chr(tape[pointer]))\ntape[pointer] += 11\noutput.append(chr(tape[pointer]))\ntape[pointer] += 8\noutput.append(chr(tape[pointer]))\npointer -= 1\n\n# Print the output\nprint(''.join(output))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the output.",
    "The output of the Brainf*ck program has been successfully determined through the simulation. The program manipulates the memory tape to produce a sequence of characters, which are then output as a string. The result of the execution is the string \"shalt\".\n\nTherefore, the final output of the Brainf*ck program is:\n\n<<<'shalt'>>>"
