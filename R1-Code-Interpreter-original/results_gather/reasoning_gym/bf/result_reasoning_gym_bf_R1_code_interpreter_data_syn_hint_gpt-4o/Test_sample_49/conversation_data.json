    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck code, we need to simulate its execution step by step. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a data pointer to manipulate data. Here's a breakdown of the code:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move the pointer to the right and set the cell to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move the pointer to the right again and set the cell to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move the pointer left and then right, effectively staying in the same position.\n4. `+++++++`: Increment the current cell (cell 2) by 7.\n5. `[<++++++++++++++>-]`: This loop will run 7 times (since the current cell is 7), and each time it will:\n   - Move left to cell 1, increment it by 14, and move back to cell 2, decrementing it by 1.\n   - After 7 iterations, cell 1 will have 98 (7 * 14) and cell 2 will be 0.\n6. `<.`: Move left to cell 1 and output its value as a character. The ASCII value 98 corresponds to 'b'.\n7. `++++++++++`: Increment the current cell (cell 1) by 10, making it 108.\n8. `.`: Output the current cell as a character. The ASCII value 108 corresponds to 'l'.\n9. `-----------`: Decrement the current cell (cell 1) by 11, making it 97.\n10. `.`: Output the current cell as a character. The ASCII value 97 corresponds to 'a'.\n11. `+++`: Increment the current cell (cell 1) by 3, making it 100.\n12. `.`: Output the current cell as a character. The ASCII value 100 corresponds to 'd'.\n13. `+.`: Increment the current cell (cell 1) by 1, making it 101.\n14. `.`: Output the current cell as a character. The ASCII value 101 corresponds to 'e'.\n15. `<`: Move left to cell 0, but this does not affect the output.\n\nThe output of the code is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\nTherefore, the output of the given Brainf*ck code is:\n\n<<<'blade'>>>"
