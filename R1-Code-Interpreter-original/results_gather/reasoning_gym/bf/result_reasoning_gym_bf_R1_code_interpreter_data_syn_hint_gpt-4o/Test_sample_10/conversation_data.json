    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck program, we need to simulate its execution. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a pointer to manipulate data. The commands are as follows:\n\n- `>`: Move the pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n- `[`: Jump forward to the command after the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the command after the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n- `,`: Input a byte and store it in the byte at the data pointer (not used in this program).\n\nLet's break down the program step by step:\n\n1. `[-]`: Set the current cell to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the first cell and then to the second cell.\n4. `++++++++++`: Increment the second cell to 10.\n5. `[<+++++++++++>-]`: Loop 10 times, each time incrementing the first cell by 11 and decrementing the second cell by 1.\n   - After the loop, the first cell will be 110, and the second cell will be 0.\n6. `<+`: Move to the first cell and increment it by 1 (111).\n7. `.-`: Output the first cell (111, which is 'o') and decrement it by 1 (110).\n8. `+++++`: Increment the first cell by 5 (115, which is 's').\n9. `.`: Output the first cell (115, which is 's').\n10. `--------------`: Decrement the first cell by 14 (101, which is 'e').\n11. `.`: Output the first cell (101, which is 'e').\n12. `+++++++++++++++`: Increment the first cell by 15 (116, which is 't').\n13. `.`: Output the first cell (116, which is 't').\n14. `<`: Move to the second cell (which is 0).\n\nThe output of the program is the sequence of characters corresponding to the ASCII values: 'o', 's', 'e', 't'.\n\nTherefore, the output of the program is:\n\n<<<oset>>>"
