    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck code, we need to simulate its execution step by step. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a data pointer to manipulate data. Here's a breakdown of the code:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move the pointer to the right and set the cell to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move the pointer to the right again and set the cell to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move the pointer left and then right, effectively staying in the same position.\n4. `+++++++`: Increment the current cell by 7.\n5. `[<+++++++++++++++>-]`: This loop will run 7 times (since the current cell is 7), and each time it will:\n   - Move left, increment the cell by 15, move right, and decrement the current cell.\n6. After the loop, the cell to the left will have a value of 105 (7 * 15).\n7. `<.`: Move left and output the character corresponding to the ASCII value 105, which is 'i'.\n8. `-----.`: Decrement the current cell by 5 (making it 100) and output the character 'd'.\n9. `+++++.`: Increment the current cell by 5 (making it 105) and output the character 'i'.\n10. `++++++.`: Increment the current cell by 6 (making it 111) and output the character 'o'.\n11. `--.`: Decrement the current cell by 2 (making it 109) and output the character 'm'.\n12. `<`: Move left, but this doesn't affect the output.\n\nThe output of the code is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands.\n\nTherefore, the output of the given Brainf*ck code is:\n\n<<<'idiom'>>>"
