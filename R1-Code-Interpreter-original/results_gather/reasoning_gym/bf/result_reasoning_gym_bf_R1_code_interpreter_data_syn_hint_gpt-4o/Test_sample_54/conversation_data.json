    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck code, we need to simulate its execution step by step. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a data pointer to manipulate data. Here's a breakdown of the code:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the first cell.\n4. `++++++++`: Increment the first cell to 8.\n5. `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply the value in the first cell by 13 and store it in the second cell. This results in the second cell having a value of 104 (8 * 13).\n6. `<-.`: Move back to the first cell and decrement it by 1, then output the ASCII character corresponding to 7 (bell character).\n7. `+++++++++++.`: Increment the first cell to 17 and output the ASCII character corresponding to 17 (device control 1).\n8. `---.`: Decrement the first cell to 14 and output the ASCII character corresponding to 14 (shift out).\n9. `++++++++.`: Increment the first cell to 22 and output the ASCII character corresponding to 22 (synchronous idle).\n10. `-----------.`: Decrement the first cell to 9 and output the ASCII character corresponding to 9 (horizontal tab).\n11. `<`: Move back to the second cell.\n\nThe output of the code is a sequence of non-printable ASCII characters. To provide the exact output, we need to simulate the code execution. Let's write a Python script to do this.\n\n```python\ndef brainfuck_interpreter(code):\n    tape = [0] * 30000\n    pointer = 0\n    code_pointer = 0\n    output = []\n    loop_stack = []\n\n    while code_pointer < len(code):\n        command = code[code_pointer]\n\n        if command == '>':\n            pointer += 1\n        elif command == '<':\n            pointer -= 1\n        elif command == '+':\n            tape[pointer] = (tape[pointer] + 1) % 256\n        elif command == '-':\n            tape[pointer] = (tape[pointer] - 1) % 256\n        elif command == '.':\n            output.append(chr(tape[pointer]))\n        elif command == ',':\n            pass  # No input handling\n        elif command == '[':\n            if tape[pointer] == 0:\n                open_brackets = 1\n                while open_brackets != 0:\n                    code_pointer += 1\n                    if code[code_pointer] == '[':\n                        open_brackets += 1\n                    elif code[code_pointer] == ']':\n                        open_brackets -= 1\n            else:\n                loop_stack.append(code_pointer)\n        elif command == ']':\n            if tape[pointer] != 0:\n                code_pointer = loop_stack[-1]\n            else:\n                loop_stack.pop()\n\n        code_pointer += 1\n\n    return ''.join(output)\n\nbf_code = \">[-]>[-]<>++++++++[<+++++++++++++>-]<-.+++++++++++.---.++++++++.-----------.<\"\noutput = brainfuck_interpreter(bf_code)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nThis script will execute the Brainf*ck code and print the output.",
