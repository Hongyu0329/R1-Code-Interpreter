    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck program, we need to simulate its execution. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a pointer to manipulate data. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move the pointer to the right and set the cell to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move the pointer to the right again and set the cell to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move the pointer left and then right, effectively staying in the same position.\n4. `++++++++++`: Increment the current cell (cell 2) by 10.\n5. `[<++++++++++>-]`: This loop will run 10 times, decrementing the current cell (cell 2) each time and incrementing the previous cell (cell 1) by 10. After the loop, cell 2 will be 0, and cell 1 will be 100.\n6. `<.`: Move the pointer left to cell 1 and output its value as a character. The ASCII value 100 corresponds to the character 'd'.\n7. `---`: Decrement the current cell (cell 1) by 3, making it 97.\n8. `.`: Output the current cell (cell 1) as a character. The ASCII value 97 corresponds to the character 'a'.\n9. `+++++++++++`: Increment the current cell (cell 1) by 11, making it 108.\n10. `.`: Output the current cell (cell 1) as a character. The ASCII value 108 corresponds to the character 'l'.\n11. `.`: Output the current cell (cell 1) as a character again, which is still 'l'.\n12. `+++++++++++++`: Increment the current cell (cell 1) by 13, making it 121.\n13. `.`: Output the current cell (cell 1) as a character. The ASCII value 121 corresponds to the character 'y'.\n14. `<`: Move the pointer left to cell 0.\n\nThe output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands. Let's compile the output:\n\n- 'd'\n- 'a'\n- 'l'\n- 'l'\n- 'y'\n\nThus, the output of the program is:\n\n<<<\"dally\">>>"
