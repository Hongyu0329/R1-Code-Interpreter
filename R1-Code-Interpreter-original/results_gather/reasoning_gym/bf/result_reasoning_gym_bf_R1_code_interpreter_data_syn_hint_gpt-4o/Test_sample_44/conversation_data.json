    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck code, we need to simulate its execution step by step. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a data pointer to manipulate data. Here's a breakdown of the code:\n\n1. `[-]`: This loop sets the current cell to 0. It decrements the value at the current cell until it reaches 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the first cell.\n4. `+++++++`: Increment the first cell by 7.\n5. `[<+++++++++++++++>-]`: This loop multiplies the value in the first cell by 15 and stores it in the second cell. It does this by moving 15 times to the right, incrementing the second cell, and then moving back to the first cell to decrement it.\n6. `<.`: Move to the first cell and output its value as a character.\n7. `-----.`: Decrement the first cell by 5 and output its value as a character.\n8. `+++++.`: Increment the first cell by 5 and output its value as a character.\n9. `++++++.`: Increment the first cell by 6 and output its value as a character.\n10. `--.<`: Decrement the first cell by 2, output its value as a character, and move to the second cell.\n\nLet's simulate this step by step using Python to determine the output:\n\n```python\n# Initialize memory tape and pointer\ntape = [0] * 30000\npointer = 0\n\n# Execute the Brainf*ck code\n# [-]\nwhile tape[pointer] != 0:\n    tape[pointer] -= 1\n\n# >[-]\npointer += 1\nwhile tape[pointer] != 0:\n    tape[pointer] -= 1\n\n# <>\npointer -= 1\n\n# +++++++\ntape[pointer] += 7\n\n# [<+++++++++++++++>-]\nwhile tape[pointer] != 0:\n    pointer -= 1\n    tape[pointer] += 15\n    pointer += 1\n    tape[pointer] -= 1\n\n# <.\npointer -= 1\noutput = chr(tape[pointer])\n\n# -----\ntape[pointer] -= 5\noutput += chr(tape[pointer])\n\n# +++++\ntape[pointer] += 5\noutput += chr(tape[pointer])\n\n# ++++++\ntape[pointer] += 6\noutput += chr(tape[pointer])\n\n# --.<\ntape[pointer] -= 2\noutput += chr(tape[pointer])\npointer -= 1\n\n# Print the output\nprint(output)\n```\n\nThis code will simulate the Brainf*ck program and print the output. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The output \"idiom\" is the result of simulating the given Brainf*ck code. The code manipulates the memory tape to produce this sequence of characters. \n\nThe Brainf*ck code essentially performs a series of operations to set specific values in the memory cells, which are then output as ASCII characters. The operations include loops to set cells to zero, incrementing cells to specific values, and outputting the characters corresponding to those values.\n\nThe final output of the code is the string \"idiom\".\n\n<<<'idiom'>>>"
