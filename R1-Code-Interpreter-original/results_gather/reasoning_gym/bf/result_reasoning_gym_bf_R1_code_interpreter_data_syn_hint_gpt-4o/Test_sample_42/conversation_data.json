    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck program, we need to simulate its execution. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a pointer to manipulate data. The commands are as follows:\n\n- `>`: Move the pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n- `[`: Jump forward to the command after the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the command after the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n- `,`: Input a byte and store it in the byte at the data pointer (not used in this program).\n\nLet's break down the program step by step:\n\n1. `[-]`: Set the current cell to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the first cell.\n4. `++++++++[<++++++++++++>-]`: This loop sets the first cell to 64 (8 * 8).\n5. `<+.`: Move to the first cell, increment it by 1 (making it 65), and output it ('A').\n6. `>++++[<++++++>-]`: Move to the second cell, set it to 24 (4 * 6).\n7. `<-.`: Move to the first cell, decrement it by 1 (making it 64), and output it ('@').\n8. `---------------`: Decrement the first cell by 15 (making it 49).\n9. `.`: Output the first cell ('1').\n10. `++++++`: Increment the first cell by 6 (making it 55).\n11. `.`: Output the first cell ('7').\n12. `-`: Decrement the first cell by 1 (making it 54).\n13. `.`: Output the first cell ('6').\n14. `<`: Move to the second cell.\n\nNow, let's execute the program to confirm the output:\n\n```python\ndef brainfuck_interpreter(program):\n    tape = [0] * 30000\n    pointer = 0\n    output = []\n    pc = 0\n    loop_stack = []\n\n    while pc < len(program):\n        command = program[pc]\n\n        if command == '>':\n            pointer += 1\n        elif command == '<':\n            pointer -= 1\n        elif command == '+':\n            tape[pointer] = (tape[pointer] + 1) % 256\n        elif command == '-':\n            tape[pointer] = (tape[pointer] - 1) % 256\n        elif command == '.':\n            output.append(chr(tape[pointer]))\n        elif command == '[':\n            if tape[pointer] == 0:\n                open_brackets = 1\n                while open_brackets != 0:\n                    pc += 1\n                    if program[pc] == '[':\n                        open_brackets += 1\n                    elif program[pc] == ']':\n                        open_brackets -= 1\n            else:\n                loop_stack.append(pc)\n        elif command == ']':\n            if tape[pointer] != 0:\n                pc = loop_stack[-1]\n            else:\n                loop_stack.pop()\n\n        pc += 1\n\n    return ''.join(output)\n\nprogram = \"[-]>[-]<>++++++++[<++++++++++++>-]<+.>++++[<++++++>-]<-.---------------.++++++.-.<\"\nprint(brainfuck_interpreter(program))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the output.",
