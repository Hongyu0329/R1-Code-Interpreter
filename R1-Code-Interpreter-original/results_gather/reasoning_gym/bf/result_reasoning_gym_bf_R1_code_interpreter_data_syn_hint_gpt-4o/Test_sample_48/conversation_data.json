    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck code, we need to simulate its execution. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a data pointer to manipulate data. The commands are as follows:\n\n- `>`: Move the data pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the data pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n- `[`: Jump forward to the command after the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the command after the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n- `,`: Input a byte and store it in the byte at the data pointer (not used in this code).\n\nLet's break down the code step by step:\n\n1. `[-]`: Set the current cell to 0.\n2. `>`: Move to the next cell.\n3. `[-]`: Set the current cell to 0.\n4. `<>`: Move back to the first cell and then to the second cell.\n5. `+++++++++`: Increment the second cell to 9.\n6. `[<+++++++++++++>-]`: This loop will run 9 times, incrementing the first cell by 13 each time, resulting in 117 in the first cell.\n7. `<--`: Move to the first cell and decrement it twice, resulting in 115.\n8. `.`: Output the character corresponding to ASCII 115, which is 's'.\n9. `-----------`: Decrement the first cell by 11, resulting in 104.\n10. `.`: Output the character corresponding to ASCII 104, which is 'h'.\n11. `---`: Decrement the first cell by 3, resulting in 101.\n12. `.`: Output the character corresponding to ASCII 101, which is 'e'.\n13. `++++`: Increment the first cell by 4, resulting in 105.\n14. `.`: Output the character corresponding to ASCII 105, which is 'i'.\n15. `++`: Increment the first cell by 2, resulting in 107.\n16. `.`: Output the character corresponding to ASCII 107, which is 'k'.\n17. `<`: Move to the second cell.\n18. `.`: Output the character corresponding to ASCII 9, which is a tab character.\n\nThe output of the code is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands. Therefore, the output is:\n\n<<<'sheik\\t'>>>"
