    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck program, we need to simulate the execution of the code. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a pointer to manipulate data. The commands are as follows:\n\n- `>`: Move the pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n- `[`: Jump forward to the command after the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the command after the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n- `,`: Input a byte and store it in the byte at the data pointer (not used in this program).\n\nLet's break down the program step by step:\n\n1. `[-]`: Set the current cell to 0.\n2. `>`: Move to the next cell.\n3. `[-]`: Set the current cell to 0.\n4. `<>`: Move back to the first cell and then to the second cell.\n5. `+++++++`: Increment the second cell to 7.\n6. `[<++++++++++++++>-]`: This loop will run 7 times, incrementing the first cell by 14 each time, resulting in the first cell being 98 (7 * 14).\n7. `<.-`: Move to the first cell, output its value (98, which is 'b'), and decrement it to 97.\n8. `.++++++++++`: Output the current value (97, which is 'a'), then increment it by 10 to 107.\n9. `.`: Output the current value (107, which is 'k').\n10. `------`: Decrement the current value by 6 to 101.\n11. `.`: Output the current value (101, which is 'e').\n12. `+++++++++++++`: Increment the current value by 13 to 114.\n13. `.`: Output the current value (114, which is 'r').\n14. `<`: Move to the second cell.\n\nThe output of the program is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands. Let's execute the code to confirm the output.\n\n```python\n# Brainf*ck interpreter to execute the given program\ndef brainfuck_interpreter(code):\n    tape = [0] * 30000\n    pointer = 0\n    code_pointer = 0\n    output = []\n    loop_stack = []\n\n    while code_pointer < len(code):\n        command = code[code_pointer]\n\n        if command == '>':\n            pointer += 1\n        elif command == '<':\n            pointer -= 1\n        elif command == '+':\n            tape[pointer] += 1\n        elif command == '-':\n            tape[pointer] -= 1\n        elif command == '.':\n            output.append(chr(tape[pointer]))\n        elif command == '[':\n            if tape[pointer] == 0:\n                open_brackets = 1\n                while open_brackets != 0:\n                    code_pointer += 1\n                    if code[code_pointer] == '[':\n                        open_brackets += 1\n                    elif code[code_pointer] == ']':\n                        open_brackets -= 1\n            else:\n                loop_stack.append(code_pointer)\n        elif command == ']':\n            if tape[pointer] != 0:\n                code_pointer = loop_stack[-1]\n            else:\n                loop_stack.pop()\n\n        code_pointer += 1\n\n    return ''.join(output)\n\n# Given Brainf*ck program\nprogram = \"[-]>[-]<>+++++++[<++++++++++++++>-]<.-.++++++++++.------.+++++++++++++.<\"\noutput = brainfuck_interpreter(program)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to get the output.",
