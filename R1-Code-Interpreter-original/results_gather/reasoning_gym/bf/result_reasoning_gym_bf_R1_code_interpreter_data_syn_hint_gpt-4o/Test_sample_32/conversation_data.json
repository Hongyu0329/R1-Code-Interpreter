    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck program, we need to simulate the execution of the code. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a pointer to manipulate data. The commands are as follows:\n\n- `>`: Move the pointer to the right.\n- `<`: Move the pointer to the left.\n- `+`: Increment the byte at the data pointer.\n- `-`: Decrement the byte at the data pointer.\n- `[`: Jump forward to the command after the matching `]` if the byte at the data pointer is zero.\n- `]`: Jump back to the command after the matching `[` if the byte at the data pointer is nonzero.\n- `.`: Output the byte at the data pointer as a character.\n\nLet's break down the program step by step:\n\n1. `[-]`: Set the current cell to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move to the next cell and set it to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move back to the first cell.\n4. `++++++++`: Increment the first cell to 8.\n5. `[<++++++++++++++>-]`: Loop to multiply the first cell by 14, resulting in 112 in the second cell.\n6. `<.`: Output the character corresponding to 112, which is 'p'.\n7. `----`: Decrement the first cell by 4, resulting in 4.\n8. `.`: Output the character corresponding to 4, which is a non-printable character.\n9. `+++++++++`: Increment the first cell by 9, resulting in 13.\n10. `.`: Output the character corresponding to 13, which is a carriage return (non-printable).\n11. `--------`: Decrement the first cell by 8, resulting in 5.\n12. `.`: Output the character corresponding to 5, which is a non-printable character.\n13. `+++`: Increment the first cell by 3, resulting in 8.\n14. `.`: Output the character corresponding to 8, which is a backspace (non-printable).\n15. `<`: Move back to the first cell.\n\nThe program outputs a sequence of characters, but most of them are non-printable. The only printable character is 'p'. Therefore, the output of the program is:\n\n<<<p>>>"
