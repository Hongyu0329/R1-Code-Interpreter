    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck program, we need to simulate its execution. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a pointer to manipulate data. Here's a breakdown of the program:\n\n1. `[-]` - Sets the current cell to 0.\n2. `>[-]` - Moves to the next cell and sets it to 0.\n3. `<>` - Moves back to the first cell.\n4. `+++++++[<++++++++++++++>-]` - Sets the first cell to 7, then multiplies it by 14, resulting in 98 (ASCII 'b').\n5. `<.` - Outputs the character 'b'.\n6. `>++++[<++++>-]` - Moves to the second cell, sets it to 4, then multiplies it by 4, resulting in 16 (ASCII 'p').\n7. `<.` - Outputs the character 'p'.\n8. `>++++[<---->-]` - Moves to the third cell, sets it to 4, then multiplies it by -4, resulting in -16 (ASCII 'p' again, as negative values wrap around).\n9. `<-.` - Outputs the character 'o'.\n10. `>+++[<+++++++>-]` - Moves to the fourth cell, sets it to 3, then multiplies it by 7, resulting in 21 (ASCII 'u').\n11. `<.` - Outputs the character 'u'.\n12. `>++++[<---->-]` - Moves to the fifth cell, sets it to 4, then multiplies it by -4, resulting in -16 (ASCII 't' again, as negative values wrap around).\n13. `<-.` - Outputs the character 't'.\n14. `<` - Moves back to the first cell.\n\nNow, let's execute the program to see the output.\n\n```python\n# Brainf*ck interpreter to execute the given program\ndef brainfuck_interpreter(code):\n    tape = [0] * 30000\n    pointer = 0\n    code_pointer = 0\n    output = []\n    loop_stack = []\n\n    while code_pointer < len(code):\n        command = code[code_pointer]\n\n        if command == '>':\n            pointer += 1\n        elif command == '<':\n            pointer -= 1\n        elif command == '+':\n            tape[pointer] = (tape[pointer] + 1) % 256\n        elif command == '-':\n            tape[pointer] = (tape[pointer] - 1) % 256\n        elif command == '.':\n            output.append(chr(tape[pointer]))\n        elif command == ',':\n            pass  # No input handling\n        elif command == '[':\n            if tape[pointer] == 0:\n                open_brackets = 1\n                while open_brackets != 0:\n                    code_pointer += 1\n                    if code[code_pointer] == '[':\n                        open_brackets += 1\n                    elif code[code_pointer] == ']':\n                        open_brackets -= 1\n            else:\n                loop_stack.append(code_pointer)\n        elif command == ']':\n            if tape[pointer] != 0:\n                code_pointer = loop_stack[-1]\n            else:\n                loop_stack.pop()\n\n        code_pointer += 1\n\n    return ''.join(output)\n\nprogram = \"[-]>[-]<>+++++++[<++++++++++++++>-]<.>++++[<++++>-]<.>++++[<---->-]<-.>+++[<+++++++>-]<.>++++[<---->-]<-.<\"\noutput = brainfuck_interpreter(program)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to find the output.",
