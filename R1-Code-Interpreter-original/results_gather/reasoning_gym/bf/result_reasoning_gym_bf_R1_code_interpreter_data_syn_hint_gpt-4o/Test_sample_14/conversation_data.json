    "To determine the output of the given Brainf*ck code, we need to simulate its execution step by step. Brainf*ck is a minimalist programming language that uses a memory tape and a data pointer to manipulate data. Here's a breakdown of the code:\n\n1. `>[-]`: Move the pointer to the right and set the cell to 0.\n2. `>[-]`: Move the pointer to the right again and set the cell to 0.\n3. `<>`: Move the pointer left and then right, effectively staying in the same position.\n4. `++++++++++`: Increment the current cell (cell 2) by 10.\n5. `[<+++++++++++>-]`: Loop that moves left, increments the left cell (cell 1) by 11, moves right, and decrements the current cell (cell 2) until the current cell is 0. This results in cell 1 having a value of 110 and cell 2 having a value of 0.\n6. `<+.`: Move left to cell 1 and output its value as a character, which is 'n' (ASCII 110).\n7. `+++++++++.`: Increment cell 1 by 9 (making it 119) and output it as a character, which is 'w' (ASCII 119).\n8. `---------------.`: Decrement cell 1 by 15 (making it 104) and output it as a character, which is 'h' (ASCII 104).\n9. `-----.`: Decrement cell 1 by 5 (making it 99) and output it as a character, which is 'c' (ASCII 99).\n10. `+.<`: Increment cell 1 by 1 (making it 100) and output it as a character, which is 'd' (ASCII 100).\n\nThe output of the code is the sequence of characters produced by the `.` commands. Let's summarize the output:\n\n- 'n' (ASCII 110)\n- 'w' (ASCII 119)\n- 'h' (ASCII 104)\n- 'c' (ASCII 99)\n- 'd' (ASCII 100)\n\nCombining these characters, the output of the Brainf*ck code is \"nwhcd\".\n\n<<<'nwhcd'>>>"
