    "\nassistant > To identify the pattern in the grid, let's first examine the positions of the ✅ symbols. We can observe that the grid is 20x20, and the ✅ symbols appear in a repeating pattern. Let's analyze the rows and columns where the ✅ symbols appear:\n\n1. In rows 2, 6, 10, 14, and 18, the ✅ symbols appear in columns 9 and 17.\n2. In rows 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20, the ✅ symbols appear in columns 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18.\n\nFrom this, we can deduce the following pattern:\n- In every 4th row starting from row 2, the ✅ symbols appear in columns 9 and 17.\n- In every 4th row starting from row 4, the ✅ symbols appear in columns 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18.\n\nNow, let's fill in the missing symbol at row 15, column 18, based on this pattern.
