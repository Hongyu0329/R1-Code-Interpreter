    "\nassistant > To identify the mathematical pattern in the grid, let's first analyze the positions of the check marks (✅) in the grid. We will look for any consistent pattern in their row and column indices.\n\nLet's list the positions of the check marks:\n\n1. (1, 8)\n2. (2, 4), (2, 11), (2, 18)\n3. (3, 12)\n4. (4, 3), (4, 9), (4, 16)\n5. (5, 10)\n6. (6, 6), (6, 13)\n7. (8, 2), (8, 8), (8, 15)\n8. (9, 5), (9, 19)\n9. (10, 11)\n10. (11, 1), (11, 17)\n11. (12, 7), (12, 14)\n12. (14, 9)\n13.

(20, 6), (20, 13)\n\nFrom this, we can observe that the check marks seem to follow a pattern based on modular arithmetic. Let's analyze the pattern further to determine the rule and fill in the missing check mark.\n\nThe pattern appears to be that the check marks are placed in positions where the column index is a multiple of a certain number plus an offset, depending on the row.
