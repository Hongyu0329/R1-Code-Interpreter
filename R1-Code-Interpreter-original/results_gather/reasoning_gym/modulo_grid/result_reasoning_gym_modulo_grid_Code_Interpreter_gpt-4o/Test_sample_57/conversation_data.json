    "\nassistant > To identify the pattern in the grid, let's first examine the positions of the checkmarks (✅) in the grid. We can observe that the checkmarks appear in a regular pattern. Let's list the positions of the checkmarks:\n\n- Row 2, Column 6\n- Row 2, Column 13\n- Row 3, Column 17 (marked as ❔)\n- Row 4, Column 6\n- Row 4, Column 13\n- Row 6, Column 6\n- Row 6, Column 13\n- Row 8, Column 6\n- Row 8, Column 13\n- Row 10, Column 6\n- Row 10, Column 13\n- Row 12, Column 6\n- Row 12, Column 13\n- Row 14, Column 6\n- Row 14, Column 13\n- Row 16, Column 6\n- Row 16, Column 13\n- Row 18, Column 6\n- Row 18, Column 13\n- Row 20, Column 6\n- Row 20, Column 13\n\nFrom this, we can see that the checkmarks appear in every even row (2, 4, 6, ..., 20) and in columns 6 and 13.
