    "\nassistant > To identify the pattern in the grid, let's first examine the positions of the checkmarks (✅) in the grid. We can then determine the rule or pattern that governs their placement.\n\nThe grid is 20x20, and the positions of the checkmarks are as follows:\n\n- Row 2, Column 7\n- Row 3, Column 4\n- Row 4, Column 3\n- Row 5, Column 12\n- Row 6, Column 6\n- Row 7, Column 2\n- Row 8, Column 10\n- Row 9, Column 15\n- Row 10, Column 8\n- Row 11, Column 13\n- Row 12, Column 5\n- Row 13, Column 11\n- Row 14, Column 19\n- Row 15, Column 15\n- Row 16, Column 9\n- Row 17, Column 18\n- Row 18, Column 17\n- Row 19, Column 14\n\nThe pattern seems to be non-linear and not immediately obvious. Let's analyze the differences between the row and column indices to see if there is a consistent pattern or sequence.\n\nWe'll calculate the differences between the row and column indices for each checkmark and see if a pattern emerges.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Positions of the checkmarks (row, column)\npositions = [\n    (2, 7), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 12), (6, 6), (7, 2), (8, 10),\n    (9, 15), (10, 8), (11, 13), (12, 5), (13, 11), (14, 19),\n    (15, 15), (16, 9), (17, 18), (18, 17), (19, 14)\n]\n\n# Calculate the differences between row and column indices\ndifferences = [(row - col) for row, col in positions]\ndifferences\nassistant > The differences between the row and column indices for each checkmark are as follows:\n\n- Row 2, Column 7: Difference = -5\n- Row 3, Column 4: Difference = -1\n- Row 4, Column 3: Difference = 1\n- Row 5, Column 12: Difference = -7\n- Row 6, Column 6: Difference = 0\n- Row 7, Column 2: Difference = 5\n- Row 8, Column 10: Difference = -2\n- Row 9, Column 15: Difference = -6\n- Row 10, Column 8: Difference = 2\n- Row 11, Column 13: Difference = -2\n- Row 12, Column 5: Difference = 7\n- Row 13, Column 11: Difference = 2\n- Row 14, Column 19: Difference = -5\n- Row 15, Column 15: Difference = 0\n- Row 16, Column 9: Difference = 7\n- Row 17, Column 18: Difference = -1\n- Row 18, Column 17: Difference = 1\n- Row 19, Column 14: Difference = 5\n\nThe differences do not follow a simple arithmetic or geometric sequence.
