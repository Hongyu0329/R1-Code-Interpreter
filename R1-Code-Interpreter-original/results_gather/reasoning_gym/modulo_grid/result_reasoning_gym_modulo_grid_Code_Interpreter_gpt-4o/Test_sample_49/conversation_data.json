    "\nassistant > To identify the pattern in the grid, let's first examine the positions of the checkmarks (✅) in the given grid. We will then try to deduce a mathematical pattern or sequence that governs their placement.\n\nThe positions of the checkmarks in the grid are as follows (considering the top-left corner as position (0,0)):\n\n1. (1, 14)\n2. (2, 15)\n3. (3, 5)\n4. (4, 8)\n5. (5, 3)\n6. (6, 11)\n7. (7, 7)\n8. (8, 4)\n9. (9, 13)\n10. (10, 10)\n11. (11, 6)\n12. (12, 14)\n13. (13, 9)\n14. (14, 12)\n15. (15, 1)\n16. (16, 2)\n17. (17, 18)\n18. (18, 15)\n19. (19, 16)\n\nWe need to find a pattern or rule that can predict these positions and fill in the missing checkmark.
