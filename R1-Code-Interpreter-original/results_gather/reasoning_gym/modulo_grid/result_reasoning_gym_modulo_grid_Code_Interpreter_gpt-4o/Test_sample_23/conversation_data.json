We will look for a consistent pattern or sequence that determines where the checkmarks appear.\n\nThe grid is 20 rows by 20 columns. Let's list the positions of the checkmarks in each row:\n\n1. Row 1: Column 4\n2. Row 2: Column 5\n3. Row 3: Column 6\n4. Row 4: Column 1\n5. Row 5: Column 2\n6. Row 6: Column 3\n7. Row 7: Column 4\n8. Row 8: Column 5\n9. Row 9: Column 6\n10.

Row 19: Column 6\n20. Row 20: Column 7\n\nFrom this, we can observe a repeating pattern every 6 rows, where the checkmarks appear in columns 1 through 6, then the pattern repeats.
