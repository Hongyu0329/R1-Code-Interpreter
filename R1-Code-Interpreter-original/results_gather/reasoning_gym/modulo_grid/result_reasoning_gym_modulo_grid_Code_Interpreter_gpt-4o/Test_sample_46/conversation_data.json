    "\nassistant > To identify the mathematical pattern in the grid, let's first examine the positions of the check marks (✅) in the grid. We can observe the following:\n\n- The grid is 20x20.\n- The check marks appear to follow a diagonal pattern, but not a simple one. They seem to be offset in a way that repeats every few rows.\n\nLet's analyze the positions of the check marks in the first few rows to see if we can identify a pattern:\n\n1. Row 2: Check marks at positions 5, 12, 19\n2. Row 3: Check marks at positions 3, 10, 17\n3. Row 4: Check marks at positions 7, 14\n4. Row 5: Check marks at positions 2, 9, 16\n5. Row 6: Check marks at positions 6, 13, 20\n6. Row 7: Check marks at positions 4, 11, 18\n\nIt seems like the check marks are placed in a pattern that shifts by a certain number of columns each time.
