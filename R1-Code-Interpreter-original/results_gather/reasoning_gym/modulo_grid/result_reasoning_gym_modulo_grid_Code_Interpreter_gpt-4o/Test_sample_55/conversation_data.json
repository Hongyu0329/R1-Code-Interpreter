    "\nassistant > To identify the pattern in the grid, let's first analyze the positions of the checkmarks (✅) and see if there is a recognizable sequence or pattern. The grid is 20x20, and the positions of the checkmarks are as follows:\n\n- Row 2, Column 4\n- Row 4, Column 2\n- Row 4, Column 8\n- Row 4, Column 14\n- Row 6, Column 16\n- Row 8, Column 4\n- Row 12, Column 16\n- Row 14, Column 4\n- Row 16, Column 6\n- Row 16, Column 12\n- Row 16, Column 18\n- Row 18, Column 16\n- Row 20, Column 4\n\nThe question mark is located at Row 1, Column 9.\n\nLet's analyze the pattern in the positions of the checkmarks to determine the rule governing their placement. Once we identify the pattern, we can fill in the question mark.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the positions of the checkmarks\ncheckmark_positions = [\n    (2, 4), (4, 2), (4, 8), (4, 14), (6, 16),\n    (8, 4), (12, 16), (14, 4), (16, 6), (16, 12),\n    (16, 18), (18, 16), (20, 4)\n]\n\n# Analyze the pattern in the positions\nrows = [pos[0] for pos in checkmark_positions]\ncols = [pos[1] for pos in checkmark_positions]\n\nrows, cols\nassistant > The checkmarks are placed at specific rows and columns. Let's analyze the pattern:\n\n- **Rows**: The sequence of rows is: 2, 4, 4, 4, 6, 8, 12, 14, 16, 16, 16, 18, 20.\n  - The rows seem to follow a pattern where some rows are repeated, and others increase by 2 or 4.\n\n- **Columns**: The sequence of columns is: 4, 2, 8, 14, 16, 4, 16, 4, 6, 12, 18, 16, 4.\n  - The columns seem to follow a pattern where they are either increasing or repeating.\n\nLet's try to identify a mathematical pattern or rule that governs these sequences. One possible approach is to look for arithmetic or geometric sequences, or any other recognizable pattern. \n\nLet's check if there is a consistent pattern in the differences between consecutive elements in the rows and columns.# Calculate the differences between consecutive elements in the rows and columns\nrow_differences = [rows[i] - rows[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(rows))]\ncol_differences = [cols[i] - cols[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(cols))]\n\nrow_differences, col_differences\nassistant > The differences between consecutive elements reveal the following patterns:\n\n- **Row Differences**: The differences are [2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2].\n  - The pattern seems to involve increments of 2, with some repetitions (0 differences).\n\n- **Column Differences**: The differences are [-2, 6, 6, 2, -12, 12, -12, 2, 6, 6, -2, -12].\n  - The pattern involves alternating increments and decrements, with some larger jumps.\n\nGiven these patterns, it seems that the placement of checkmarks follows a specific sequence that involves both repetition and arithmetic progression.\n\nLet's try to fill in the question mark at Row 1, Column 9 by identifying if it fits into any of these patterns. Since the question mark is in the first row, it might be part of a new sequence or a continuation of an existing one.
