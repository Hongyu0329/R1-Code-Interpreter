    "\nassistant > To identify the pattern in the grid, let's first examine the positions of the \"✅\" marks. We can then determine if there is a mathematical pattern or sequence that these positions follow.\n\nThe grid is 20x20, and the positions of the \"✅\" marks are as follows:\n\n- Row 2, Column 10\n- Row 4, Column 4\n- Row 4, Column 20\n- Row 6, Column 6\n- Row 8, Column 16\n- Row 10, Column 2\n- Row 10, Column 18\n- Row 12, Column 12\n- Row 14, Column 14\n- Row 16, Column 8\n- Row 18, Column 10\n- Row 20, Column 4\n- Row 20, Column 20\n\nLet's analyze these positions to find a pattern. \n\n1.

Let's check if there is a mathematical relationship or sequence that can be derived from these positions. \n\nThe pattern seems to be symmetric, and the positions of the \"✅\" marks suggest a diagonal or mirrored pattern.
