    "\nassistant > To identify the mathematical pattern in the grid, let's first analyze the positions of the \"✅\" marks. We can observe that the grid has a consistent pattern in the placement of \"✅\" marks, especially in the second column and the last column. \n\nLet's break down the pattern:\n\n1. The first row is entirely filled with \"✅\".\n2. The second column (from the second row onward) is filled with \"✅\".\n3. The last column (from the second row onward) is filled with \"✅\".\n4. There are additional \"✅\" marks in certain rows, which seem to follow a specific pattern.\n\nLet's examine the rows with additional \"✅\" marks:\n\n- Row 3: \"✅\" at column 18\n- Row 4: \"✅\" at column 8 and 14\n- Row 7: \"✅\" at column 6, 8, 11, 13, 16\n- Row 13: \"✅\" at column 6, 8, 11, 13, 16\n- Row 16: \"✅\" at column 8 and 14\n- Row 19: \"✅\" at column 6, 8, 11, 13, 16\n\nThe pattern seems to repeat every 6 rows, with specific columns being marked as \"✅\". Let's fill in the missing \"?\" based on this pattern. \n\nThe missing \"?\" is in row 17, column 10.
