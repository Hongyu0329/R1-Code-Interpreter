    "\nassistant > To identify the pattern in the grid, let's first examine the positions of the checkmarks (✅) in the grid. We can observe that the checkmarks appear in a regular pattern. Let's analyze the grid to determine the pattern and then fill in the missing checkmark.\n\nThe grid is 20 rows by 20 columns. The checkmarks appear in the following rows and columns:\n\n- Row 2, Columns 3, 9, 15\n- Row 4, Columns 3, 9, 15\n- Row 6, Columns 3, 9, 15\n- Row 8, Columns 3, 9, 15\n- Row 10, Columns 3, 9, 15\n- Row 12, Columns 3, 9, 15\n- Row 14, Columns 3, 9, 15\n- Row 16, Columns 3, 9, 15\n- Row 18, Columns 3, 9, 15\n- Row 20, Columns 3, 9, 15\n\nFrom this, we can see that the checkmarks appear in every even-numbered row and in columns 3, 9, and 15. \n\nNow, let's fill in the missing checkmark in the grid based on this pattern.
