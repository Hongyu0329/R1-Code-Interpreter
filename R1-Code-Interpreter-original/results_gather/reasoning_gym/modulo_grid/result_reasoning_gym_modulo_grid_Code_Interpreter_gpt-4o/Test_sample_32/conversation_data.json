    "\nassistant > To identify the mathematical pattern in the grid, let's first analyze the positions of the checkmarks (✅) in the given grid:\n\n1. The first checkmark is at position (1, 4).\n2. The second checkmark is at position (2, 2).\n3. The third checkmark is at position (2, 6).\n4. The fourth checkmark is at position (2, 10).\n5. The fifth checkmark is at position (2, 14).\n6. The sixth checkmark is at position (2, 18).\n\nFrom this, we can observe that the checkmarks in the second row are placed at every 4th column starting from the 2nd column. This suggests a pattern of placing a checkmark every 4 columns.\n\nNow, let's apply this pattern to fill in the question marks in the grid. The question mark is at position (17, 1). According to the pattern, the checkmark should be placed at every 4th column starting from the 2nd column in the second row. Therefore, the checkmark should be placed at position (17, 2).\n\nLet's fill in the grid according to this pattern and display the completed grid.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the grid size\nrows, cols = 20, 20\n\n# Initialize the grid with ❌\ngrid = [['❌' for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]\n\n# Place the checkmarks (✅) according to the identified pattern\n# Checkmarks are placed at every 4th column starting from the 2nd column in the second row\nfor col in range(2, cols, 4):\n    grid[1][col] = '✅'\n    grid[2][col] = '✅'\n\n# Place the checkmark for the question mark position\ngrid[17][1] = '✅'\n\n# Convert the grid to a string format\ncompleted_grid = '\\n'.join([''.join(row) for row in grid])\ncompleted_grid\nassistant > The completed grid, following the identified pattern, is as follows:\n\n```\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n```\n\nEnclosed within triple angle brackets, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n>>>"
