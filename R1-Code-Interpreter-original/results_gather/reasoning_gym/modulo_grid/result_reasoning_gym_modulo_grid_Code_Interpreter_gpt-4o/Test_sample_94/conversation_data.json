    "\nassistant > To identify the pattern in the grid, let's first examine the positions of the checkmarks (✅) in the grid. The grid is 20x20, and the positions of the checkmarks are as follows:\n\n1. Row 2, Column 3\n2. Row 6, Column 15\n3. Row 8, Column 4\n4. Row 12, Column 13\n5. Row 14, Column 15\n6.

Row 18, Column 11: Difference = 7\n7. Row 20, Column 3: Difference = 17\n\nThe differences do not immediately suggest a simple arithmetic or geometric sequence.

However, let's consider the possibility of a pattern based on specific positions or a combination of row and column indices.\n\nLet's try to identify a pattern by examining the positions more closely.

However, they seem to be distributed in a way that might suggest a more complex pattern or rule.\n\nLet's consider the possibility that the pattern is based on a specific rule or sequence that involves both the row and column indices. One potential approach is to check if the positions follow a specific mathematical function or rule.\n\nGiven the positions of the checkmarks, let's try to identify a pattern by examining the differences between consecutive checkmarks in terms of their row and column indices. This might help us identify a pattern or rule that can be used to fill in the question mark (❔).# Calculate the differences between consecutive checkmarks in terms of row and column indices\nrow_differences = [checkmark_positions[i][0] - checkmark_positions[i - 1][0] for i in range(1, len(checkmark_positions))]\ncol_differences = [checkmark_positions[i][1] - checkmark_positions[i - 1][1] for i in range(1, len(checkmark_positions))]\n\nrow_differences, col_differences\nassistant > The differences between consecutive checkmarks in terms of row and column indices are as follows:\n\n- Row differences: [4, 2, 4, 2, 4, 2]\n- Column differences: [12, -11, 9, 2, -4, -8]\n\nThe row differences alternate between 4 and 2, suggesting a potential pattern in the vertical placement of the checkmarks. The column differences, however, do not follow a simple pattern.\n\nGiven the alternating row differences, let's hypothesize that the checkmarks are placed in a pattern that involves alternating steps in the rows, while the columns might follow a more complex rule.\n\nLet's try to fill in the question mark (❔) based on this observation. The question mark is located at Row 8, Column 5. Based on the alternating row differences, the next checkmark after Row 8 should be at Row 12, which is consistent with the existing checkmark at Row 12, Column 13.\n\nLet's fill in the grid with this hypothesis and see if it aligns with the existing pattern.# Fill in the question mark position based on the observed pattern\nquestion_mark_position = (8, 5)\n\n# Check if the position aligns with the pattern\n# Since the row differences alternate between 4 and 2, the next checkmark after Row 8 should be at Row 12\n# The existing checkmark at Row 12, Column 13 aligns with this pattern\n\n# Update the grid with the filled position\ngrid[question_mark_position[0] - 1, question_mark_position[1] - 1] = '✅'\n\n# Convert the grid to a list of strings for display\ncompleted_grid = [''.join(row) for row in grid]\n\ncompleted_grid\nassistant > The completed grid, with the question mark (❔) filled in based on the observed pattern, is as follows:\n\n```\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n```\n\nEnclosed within triple angle brackets, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n>>>"
