    "\nassistant > The grid appears to have a diagonal pattern where the \"✅\" symbols are placed. The pattern seems to be a diagonal line that starts from the bottom-left corner and moves to the top-right corner, wrapping around the grid.\n\nLet's analyze the grid to identify the pattern:\n\n1. The first \"✅\" is at the 14th row, 1st column.\n2. The second \"✅\" is at the 15th row, 2nd column.\n3. The third \"✅\" is at the 16th row, 3rd column.\n4.

The seventh \"✅\" is at the 20th row, 7th column.\n8. The eighth \"✅\" is at the 1st row, 13th column.\n9. The ninth \"✅\" is at the 2nd row, 14th column.\n10.
