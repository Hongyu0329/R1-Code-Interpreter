    "\nassistant > To identify the pattern in the grid, let's first examine the positions of the check marks (✅) in the given grid. We can observe that the check marks appear in a repeating pattern both horizontally and vertically.\n\n1. **Horizontal Pattern**: \n   - The check marks appear every 4th column starting from the 4th column. This means they are in columns 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20.\n\n2. **Vertical Pattern**:\n   - The check marks appear every 3rd row starting from the 2nd row. This means they are in rows 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20.\n\nGiven this pattern, we can fill in the missing check mark (❔) in the grid.
