    "\nassistant > The grid appears to follow a diagonal pattern where the \"✅\" symbols are placed. Observing the pattern, it seems that the \"✅\" symbols are placed in a descending diagonal from the top right to the bottom left, and then it continues from the bottom left to the top right.\n\nLet's analyze the pattern:\n\n1. The first \"✅\" is at position (0, 10).\n2. The second \"✅\" is at position (1, 9).\n3. The third \"✅\" is at position (2, 8).\n4. This pattern continues, decreasing the column index by 1 for each subsequent row until it reaches the bottom of the grid.\n5. After reaching the bottom, the pattern continues from the bottom left to the top right, increasing the column index by 1 for each subsequent row.\n\nThe missing \"✅\" should follow this pattern.
