    "\nassistant > To identify the pattern in the grid, let's first examine the positions of the ✅ marks. We can observe the following:\n\n- The first ✅ is at position (0, 17).\n- The second ✅ is at position (1, 18).\n- The third ✅ is at position (2, 19).\n- The fourth ✅ is at position (17, 0).\n- The fifth ✅ is at position (18, 1).\n- The sixth ✅ is at position (19, 2).\n\nFrom this, we can see that the pattern is a diagonal line that wraps around the grid. Specifically, the pattern seems to be that the sum of the row and column indices is constant and equal to 17 for the first three ✅ marks, and then it wraps around to the bottom left corner and continues with the sum of indices equal to 17.\n\nLet's fill in the missing ✅ mark at position (15, 2) to complete the pattern.
