    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing part. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 20x20, with 20 rows and 20 columns.\n\n2. **Pattern Identification**:\n   - The grid has a diagonal pattern of '✅' symbols.\n   - The first '✅' appears at position (0, 8), the second at (1, 9), the third at (2, 10), and so on.\n   - Observing the positions, we see that the '✅' moves one step down and one step to the right in each subsequent row.\n\n3. **Mathematical Pattern**:\n   - The position of '✅' in each row can be described as (row_index, column_index), where column_index = row_index + 8.\n   - This pattern continues until the column index exceeds the grid size.\n\n4. **Filling the Grid**:\n   - We continue the pattern until the end of the grid.\n   - For row 18, the column index should be 18 + 8 = 26, which is out of bounds for a 20x20 grid.\n   - For row 19, the column index should be 19 + 8 = 27, which is also out of bounds.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The pattern is consistent with a diagonal line of '✅' symbols starting from (0, 8) and moving down and to the right.\n   - The '?' in the grid is at position (18, 14), which should be a '✅' based on the pattern.\n\nThus, the completed grid with the pattern filled in is:\n\n```\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n```\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n>>>"
