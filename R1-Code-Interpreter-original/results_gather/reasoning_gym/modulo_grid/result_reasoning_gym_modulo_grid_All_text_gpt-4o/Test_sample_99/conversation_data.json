    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing value represented by the question mark.\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   - The grid is a 20x20 matrix with '❌' and '✅' symbols.\n   - The '✅' symbols form a diagonal pattern from the top right to the bottom left.\n   - Observing the positions of '✅', we see that they are located at coordinates (i, 19-i) for i ranging from 0 to 19.\n\n2. **Verify the Pattern:**\n   - For i = 0, the '✅' is at (0, 19).\n   - For i = 1, the '✅' is at (1, 18).\n   - For i = 2, the '✅' is at (2, 17).\n   - This pattern continues consistently down the diagonal.\n\n3. **Locate the Question Mark:**\n   - The question mark is located at the position (12, 3).\n   - According to the identified pattern, the '✅' should be at (12, 7) because 19 - 12 = 7.\n\n4. **Fill in the Grid:**\n   - Replace the question mark at (12, 3) with '❌' because it does not fit the pattern.\n   - Ensure that the '✅' is placed at (12, 7) to maintain the diagonal pattern.\n\n5. **Complete the Grid:**\n   - The grid is completed by ensuring that the '✅' symbols follow the pattern (i, 19-i) for each row i from 0 to 19.\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n```\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n```\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n>>>"
