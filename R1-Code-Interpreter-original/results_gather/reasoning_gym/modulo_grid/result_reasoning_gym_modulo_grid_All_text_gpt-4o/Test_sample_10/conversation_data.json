    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing value represented by the question mark (❔).\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**:\n   - The grid is 20 rows by 20 columns.\n   - The grid contains two symbols: ❌ and ✅.\n   - The ✅ symbols appear in a regular pattern.\n\n2. **Pattern Identification**:\n   - Look at the rows where ✅ appears: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20.\n   - In these rows, the ✅ appears at columns: 2, 6, 10, 14, 18.\n   - This suggests a pattern where the ✅ appears every 4 columns starting from column 2.\n\n3. **Pattern Verification**:\n   - Check if the pattern holds for all rows where ✅ appears:\n     - Row 2: ✅ at columns 2, 6, 10, 14, 18.\n     - Row 4: ✅ at columns 4, 8, 12, 16, 20.\n     - Row 6: ✅ at columns 2, 6, 10, 14, 18.\n     - Row 8: ✅ at columns 4, 8, 12, 16, 20.\n     - Row 10: ✅ at columns 2, 6, 10, 14, 18.\n     - Row 12: ✅ at columns 4, 8, 12, 16, 20.\n     - Row 14: ✅ at columns 2, 6, 10, 14, 18.\n     - Row 16: ✅ at columns 4, 8, 12, 16, 20.\n     - Row 18: ✅ at columns 2, 6, 10, 14, 18.\n     - Row 20: ✅ at columns 4, 8, 12, 16, 20.\n\n4. **Determine the Missing Value**:\n   - The question mark (❔) is located at row 8, column 8.\n   - According to the pattern, row 8 should have ✅ at columns 4, 8, 12, 16, 20.\n   - Therefore, the question mark (❔) should be replaced with ✅.\n\n5. **Final Grid**:\n   - Replace the question mark (❔) with ✅ in the grid.\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n```\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅\n```\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅"
