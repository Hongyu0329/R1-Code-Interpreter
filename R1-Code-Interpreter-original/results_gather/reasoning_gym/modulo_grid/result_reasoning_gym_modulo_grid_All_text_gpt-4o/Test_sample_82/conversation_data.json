    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing value represented by the question mark.\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**: \n   - The grid is a 20x20 matrix.\n   - The grid contains two symbols: \"✅\" and \"❌\".\n   - The \"✅\" symbols appear to follow a diagonal pattern.\n\n2. **Pattern Identification**:\n   - Observing the positions of the \"✅\" symbols, they appear to form a diagonal line from the top right to the bottom left.\n   - The positions of the \"✅\" symbols in each row are as follows:\n     - Row 1: Column 9\n     - Row 2: Column 8\n     - Row 3: Column 7\n     - Row 4: Column 6\n     - Row 5: Column 5\n     - Row 6: Column 4\n     - Row 7: Column 3\n     - Row 8: Column 2\n     - Row 9: Column 1\n     - Row 10: Column 10\n     - Row 11: Column 11\n     - Row 12: Column 12\n     - Row 13: Column 13\n     - Row 14: Column 14\n     - Row 15: Column 15\n     - Row 16: Column 16\n     - Row 17: Column 17\n     - Row 18: Column 18\n     - Row 19: Column 19\n     - Row 20: Column 20\n\n3. **Pattern Description**:\n   - The \"✅\" symbols form a diagonal line that starts from the 9th column in the first row and moves one column to the left in each subsequent row until it reaches the first column in the 9th row.\n   - From the 10th row onwards, the \"✅\" symbols form another diagonal line starting from the 10th column and moving one column to the right in each subsequent row.\n\n4. **Filling the Missing Value**:\n   - The question mark is located in the 5th row and 16th column.\n   - According to the identified pattern, the 5th row should have a \"✅\" in the 5th column.\n   - Therefore, the question mark should be replaced with a \"❌\".\n\n5. **Final Grid**:\n   - Replace the question mark with \"❌\" to complete the grid.\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n```\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n```\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌"
