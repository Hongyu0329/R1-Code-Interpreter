    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing value represented by the question mark.\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**: The grid is a 20x20 matrix filled with '❌' and '✅'. The '✅' symbols appear to follow a diagonal pattern.\n\n2. **Pattern Identification**:\n   - The first '✅' appears at position (0, 6).\n   - The second '✅' appears at position (1, 7).\n   - The third '✅' appears at position (2, 8).\n   - This pattern continues with each subsequent '✅' moving one row down and one column to the right.\n\n3. **Pattern Rule**: The '✅' appears to follow the rule where the row index and column index increase by 1 for each subsequent '✅'. This suggests a diagonal line from top-left to bottom-right.\n\n4. **Filling the Grid**:\n   - The pattern continues until the grid boundary is reached.\n   - The question mark is located at position (7, 4). According to the pattern, the '✅' should be at position (7, 13) because the previous '✅' was at (6, 12) and the next '✅' is at (8, 14).\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The question mark should be replaced with '❌' because it does not align with the pattern of '✅'.\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n```\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n```\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n>>>"
