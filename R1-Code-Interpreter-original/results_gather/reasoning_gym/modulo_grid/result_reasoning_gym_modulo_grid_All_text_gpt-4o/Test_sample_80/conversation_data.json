    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing values. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Structure**: The grid is a 20x20 matrix, with some cells marked as \"✅\" and others as \"❌\". There is one cell marked with a \"❔\", which we need to determine.\n\n2. **Pattern Recognition**: \n   - Observing the grid, we notice that the \"✅\" marks form a diagonal pattern. \n   - In the top half of the grid, starting from the top-right corner, the \"✅\" marks move diagonally downwards to the left.\n   - In the bottom half of the grid, starting from the bottom-left corner, the \"✅\" marks move diagonally upwards to the right.\n\n3. **Diagonal Analysis**:\n   - The first row with a \"✅\" is at position (0, 14).\n   - The second row with a \"✅\" is at position (1, 15).\n   - The third row with a \"✅\" is at position (2, 16).\n   - The fourth row with a \"✅\" is at position (3, 17).\n   - The fifth row with a \"✅\" is at position (4, 18).\n   - The sixth row with a \"✅\" is at position (5, 19).\n\n   - The bottom half starts with:\n   - The fourteenth row with a \"✅\" is at position (14, 0).\n   - The fifteenth row with a \"✅\" is at position (15, 1).\n   - The sixteenth row with a \"✅\" is at position (16, 2).\n   - The seventeenth row with a \"✅\" is at position (17, 3).\n   - The eighteenth row with a \"✅\" is at position (18, 4).\n   - The nineteenth row with a \"✅\" is at position (19, 5).\n\n4. **Identifying the Missing \"✅\"**:\n   - The pattern suggests that the \"✅\" marks form a continuous diagonal from the top-right to the bottom-left.\n   - The missing \"✅\" should be at the position where the diagonal would naturally continue.\n   - The \"❔\" is located at position (11, 7). According to the pattern, this should be a \"✅\" because it continues the diagonal from (10, 6) to (12, 8).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The \"❔\" should be replaced with a \"✅\" to complete the diagonal pattern.\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n```\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n```\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌"
