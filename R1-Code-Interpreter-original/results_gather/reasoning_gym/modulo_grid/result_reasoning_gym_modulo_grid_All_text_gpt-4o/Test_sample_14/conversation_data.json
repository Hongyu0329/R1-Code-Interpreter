    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing value represented by the question mark.\n\n1. **Observation of the Grid:**\n   - The grid is a 20x20 matrix.\n   - The grid contains two symbols: ❌ and ✅.\n   - The ✅ symbols appear to form a diagonal line from the bottom-left to the top-right of the grid.\n\n2. **Pattern Identification:**\n   - The position of the ✅ symbols seems to follow a pattern where they are placed in a diagonal line.\n   - The first row with a ✅ is the 6th row, and the ✅ is in the 1st column.\n   - The second row with a ✅ is the 5th row, and the ✅ is in the 2nd column.\n   - This pattern continues, with the row number decreasing by 1 and the column number increasing by 1 for each subsequent ✅.\n\n3. **Mathematical Representation:**\n   - The position of the ✅ can be represented as (row, column).\n   - The pattern follows: (6, 1), (5, 2), (4, 3), ..., (1, 6).\n   - This suggests that the row number plus the column number equals 7 for each ✅.\n\n4. **Finding the Missing Value:**\n   - The question mark is in the first row and the third column.\n   - For the first row, the column number that would satisfy the pattern (row + column = 7) is 6.\n   - Therefore, the position (1, 3) should be ❌, as it does not satisfy the pattern.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The grid follows a pattern where the sum of the row and column indices for a ✅ is 7.\n   - The question mark should be replaced with ❌.\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n```\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n```\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n>>>"
