    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing value represented by the question mark.\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**: The grid is a 20x20 matrix with '❌' and '✅' symbols. The '✅' symbols appear to follow a diagonal pattern.\n\n2. **Pattern Identification**:\n   - The first '✅' appears at position (0, 6).\n   - The second '✅' appears at position (1, 7).\n   - The third '✅' appears at position (2, 8).\n   - This pattern continues with each subsequent '✅' moving one row down and one column to the right.\n\n3. **Pattern Rule**: The '✅' symbol appears to follow the rule where the row index and column index increase by 1 for each subsequent '✅'. This suggests a diagonal line from the top left to the bottom right of the grid.\n\n4. **Filling the Grid**:\n   - The pattern continues until the last '✅' at position (13, 19).\n   - The next '✅' should be at position (14, 20), but since the grid is 20x20, it wraps around to the next row, starting at column 0.\n   - Therefore, the next '✅' should be at position (14, 0).\n\n5. **Completing the Grid**:\n   - The question mark is at position (8, 14). According to the pattern, this position should contain a '✅'.\n\nBy following the identified pattern, we can fill in the grid as follows:\n\n```\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n```\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n>>>"
