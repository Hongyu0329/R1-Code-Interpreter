    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing value represented by the question mark.\n\n1. **Observation of the Grid:**\n   - The grid is a 20x20 matrix.\n   - There are '✅' marks in the grid, and they seem to form a diagonal pattern.\n   - The '✅' marks appear to be moving from the top right to the bottom left.\n\n2. **Pattern Recognition:**\n   - Let's examine the positions of the '✅' marks:\n     - Row 1, Column 17\n     - Row 2, Column 16\n     - Row 3, Column 15\n     - ...\n     - Row 18, Column 2\n     - Row 19, Column 20\n     - Row 20, Column 19\n   - The pattern is that the sum of the row and column indices for each '✅' is constant:\n     - For the first 18 rows, the sum is 18 (e.g., Row 1 + Column 17 = 18).\n     - For the last two rows, the sum is 39 (e.g., Row 19 + Column 20 = 39).\n\n3. **Filling the Missing Value:**\n   - The question mark is located at Row 11, Column 4.\n   - We need to determine if this position should have a '✅' based on the identified pattern.\n   - Calculate the sum of the indices: 11 + 4 = 15.\n   - Since 15 does not match the sum of 18 or 39, this position should not have a '✅'.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The pattern is consistent, and the position with the question mark should remain '❌'.\n\nTherefore, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n>>>"
