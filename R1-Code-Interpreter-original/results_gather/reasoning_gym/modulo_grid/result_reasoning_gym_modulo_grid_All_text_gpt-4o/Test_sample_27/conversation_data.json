    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing value represented by the question mark.\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**: \n   - The grid is 20 rows by 20 columns.\n   - The grid contains two symbols: ❌ and ✅.\n   - The ✅ symbols appear in a specific pattern.\n\n2. **Pattern Identification**:\n   - Observing the grid, the ✅ symbols appear in the 4th column, 12th column, and 20th column.\n   - This pattern repeats every 8 columns (4, 12, 20).\n\n3. **Row Analysis**:\n   - The ✅ symbols appear in every 2nd row starting from the 2nd row (2, 4, 6, ..., 20).\n\n4. **Pattern Summary**:\n   - The pattern is that in every 2nd row, starting from the 2nd row, the 4th, 12th, and 20th columns contain a ✅.\n\n5. **Filling the Grid**:\n   - The question mark is located in the 1st row and 5th column.\n   - According to the pattern, the 1st row does not contain any ✅ symbols, so the question mark should be replaced with ❌.\n\n6. **Final Grid**:\n   - The grid remains unchanged except for replacing the question mark with ❌.\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n```\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n>>>"
