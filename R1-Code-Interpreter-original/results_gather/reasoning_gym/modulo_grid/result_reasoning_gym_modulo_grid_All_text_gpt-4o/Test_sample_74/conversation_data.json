    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing value represented by the question mark (❔).\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**:\n   - The grid is 20 rows by 20 columns.\n   - The first row is entirely filled with check marks (✅).\n   - The pattern in the grid seems to repeat every four rows, with the fourth row being a consistent pattern of alternating check marks and crosses (❌).\n   - The pattern in the columns seems to be consistent across the grid, with certain columns having check marks at regular intervals.\n\n2. **Column Pattern**:\n   - Column 2 (second column) has a check mark in every row.\n   - Columns 8, 10, 16, and 18 have check marks in every fourth row starting from the second row.\n   - Column 4 has check marks in every fourth row starting from the fifth row.\n   - The pattern in the columns is consistent and repeats every four rows.\n\n3. **Row Pattern**:\n   - Every fourth row (4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, 20th) has a consistent pattern of alternating check marks and crosses starting with a cross.\n\n4. **Identifying the Missing Value**:\n   - The question mark (❔) is located in the second row and the ninth column.\n   - Observing the pattern, the ninth column does not have any check marks in the second row in the repeating pattern.\n   - Therefore, the missing value should be a cross (❌).\n\n5. **Final Grid**:\n   - Replace the question mark with a cross (❌) to complete the grid.\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n```\n✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n```\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n>>>"
