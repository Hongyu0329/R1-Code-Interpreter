    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing value represented by the question mark.\n\n1. **Examine the Grid:**\n   - The grid is 20 rows by 20 columns.\n   - There are two symbols: ❌ and ✅.\n   - The ✅ symbols appear in a regular pattern.\n\n2. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   - Look at the positions of the ✅ symbols:\n     - Row 2: Columns 4, 9, 14, 19\n     - Row 4: Columns 3, 8, 13, 18\n     - Row 6: Columns 4, 9, 14, 19\n     - Row 8: Columns 3, 8, 13, 18\n     - Row 10: Columns 4, 9, 14, 19\n     - Row 12: Columns 3, 8, 13, 18\n     - Row 14: Columns 4, 9, 14, 19\n     - Row 16: Columns 3, 8, 13, 18\n     - Row 18: Columns 4, 9, 14, 19\n     - Row 20: Columns 3, 8, 13, 18\n\n3. **Determine the Pattern:**\n   - The pattern alternates every two rows.\n   - In even-numbered rows (2, 6, 10, 14, 18), the ✅ symbols are in columns 4, 9, 14, 19.\n   - In odd-numbered rows (4, 8, 12, 16, 20), the ✅ symbols are in columns 3, 8, 13, 18.\n\n4. **Locate the Question Mark:**\n   - The question mark is located at row 9, column 13.\n\n5. **Apply the Pattern:**\n   - Row 9 is an odd-numbered row, so it should follow the pattern of even-numbered rows (4, 9, 14, 19).\n   - Therefore, the question mark at row 9, column 13 should be ❌.\n\n6. **Fill in the Grid:**\n   - Replace the question mark with ❌.\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n```\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n```\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌"
