    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing value represented by the question mark.\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**: The grid is a 20x20 matrix with '❌' and '✅' symbols. The '✅' symbols appear to follow a diagonal pattern.\n\n2. **Pattern Identification**:\n   - The first row has a '✅' at the 11th position.\n   - The second row has a '✅' at the 12th position.\n   - The third row has a '✅' at the 13th position.\n   - This pattern continues, with each subsequent row having a '✅' one position to the right of the previous row's '✅'.\n   - The 10th row has a '✅' at the 20th position.\n   - The 11th row starts over with a '✅' at the 1st position.\n   - The 12th row has a '✅' at the 2nd position.\n   - This pattern continues, with each subsequent row having a '✅' one position to the right of the previous row's '✅'.\n\n3. **Pattern Formula**:\n   - For rows 1 to 10, the position of '✅' is given by: Position = Row number + 10.\n   - For rows 11 to 20, the position of '✅' is given by: Position = Row number - 10.\n\n4. **Determine the Missing Value**:\n   - The question mark is located in the 14th row.\n   - Using the pattern formula for rows 11 to 20: Position = Row number - 10 = 14 - 10 = 4.\n   - Therefore, the '✅' should be in the 4th position of the 14th row.\n\n5. **Fill in the Grid**:\n   - Replace the question mark with a '✅' at the 4th position in the 14th row.\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n```\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n```\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌"
