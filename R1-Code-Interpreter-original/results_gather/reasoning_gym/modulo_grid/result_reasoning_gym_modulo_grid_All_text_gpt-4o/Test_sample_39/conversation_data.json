    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing value represented by the question mark.\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**: The grid is a 20x20 matrix filled with '❌' and '✅'. The '✅' marks appear to follow a diagonal pattern.\n\n2. **Pattern Identification**:\n   - Observing the grid, the '✅' marks seem to form a diagonal line that shifts one column to the right as we move down each row.\n   - The first '✅' appears at position (0, 5), the second at (1, 6), the third at (2, 7), and so on.\n   - This suggests a pattern where the position of '✅' in row `n` is at column `(n + 5) % 20`.\n\n3. **Pattern Verification**:\n   - Let's verify this pattern with a few examples:\n     - For row 0: (0 + 5) % 20 = 5, which matches the position of '✅'.\n     - For row 1: (1 + 5) % 20 = 6, which matches the position of '✅'.\n     - For row 5: (5 + 5) % 20 = 10, which matches the position of '✅'.\n     - For row 19: (19 + 5) % 20 = 4, which matches the position of '✅'.\n\n4. **Filling the Missing Value**:\n   - The question mark is located at position (8, 3).\n   - According to the pattern, for row 8, the '✅' should be at column (8 + 5) % 20 = 13.\n   - Therefore, the question mark should be replaced with '❌', as the '✅' for row 8 is at column 13.\n\n5. **Final Grid**:\n   - Replace the question mark with '❌' and ensure all other positions follow the identified pattern.\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n```\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n```\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n>>>"
