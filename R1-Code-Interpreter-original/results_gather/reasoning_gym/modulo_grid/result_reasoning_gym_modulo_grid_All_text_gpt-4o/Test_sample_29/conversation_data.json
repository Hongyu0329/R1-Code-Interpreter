    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing value represented by the question mark.\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**: The grid is a 20x20 matrix filled with '❌' and '✅'. The '✅' marks appear to follow a diagonal pattern.\n\n2. **Pattern Identification**:\n   - The first '✅' appears at position (0, 6).\n   - The second '✅' appears at position (1, 7).\n   - The third '✅' appears at position (2, 8).\n   - This pattern continues with each subsequent '✅' moving one row down and one column to the right.\n\n3. **Pattern Rule**: The '✅' appears to follow the rule where the row index and column index increase by 1 for each subsequent '✅'. This suggests a diagonal line from top-left to bottom-right.\n\n4. **Filling the Grid**:\n   - The pattern continues until the '✅' reaches the bottom of the grid.\n   - The missing '✅' should follow this pattern.\n\n5. **Locate the Missing '✅'**:\n   - The last known '✅' before the question mark is at position (9, 15).\n   - Following the pattern, the next '✅' should be at position (10, 16).\n\n6. **Complete the Grid**:\n   - Place a '✅' at position (10, 16) to complete the pattern.\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n```\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n```\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n>>>"
