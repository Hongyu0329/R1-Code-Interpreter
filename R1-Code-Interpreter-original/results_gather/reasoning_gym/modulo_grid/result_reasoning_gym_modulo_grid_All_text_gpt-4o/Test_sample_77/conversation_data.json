    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the question mark. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Structure**: The grid is 20 rows by 20 columns, filled with either ❌ or ✅. We need to identify the pattern of ✅s.\n\n2. **Pattern Observation**:\n   - The ✅s appear in specific columns across different rows.\n   - Observing the rows with ✅s, we see that they appear in columns 8 and 17 in most rows.\n   - Additionally, in some rows, there are more ✅s, specifically in columns 3, 5, 9, 11, 15, and 17.\n\n3. **Row Analysis**:\n   - Rows 2, 6, 8, 12, 14, 18, and 20 have ✅s in columns 8 and 17.\n   - Rows 4, 10, and 16 have a more complex pattern with ✅s in columns 3, 5, 9, 11, 15, and 17.\n\n4. **Pattern Deduction**:\n   - The rows with more complex patterns (4, 10, 16) have a consistent pattern of ✅s in columns 3, 5, 9, 11, 15, and 17.\n   - The other rows with ✅s (2, 6, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20) have them in columns 8 and 17.\n\n5. **Filling the Question Mark**:\n   - The row with the question mark is row 15.\n   - Based on the pattern, row 15 should follow the complex pattern seen in rows 4, 10, and 16.\n   - Therefore, row 15 should have ✅s in columns 3, 5, 9, 11, 15, and 17.\n\n6. **Final Grid**:\n   - We fill in the question mark in row 15 with a ✅ in columns 3, 5, 9, 11, 15, and 17.\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n```\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n```\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n>>>"
