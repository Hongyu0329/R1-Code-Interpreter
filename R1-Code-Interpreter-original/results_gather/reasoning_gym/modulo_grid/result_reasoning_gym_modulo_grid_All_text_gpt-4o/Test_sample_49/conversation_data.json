    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid where the \"✅\" symbols are placed. Let's analyze the given grid step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 20 rows by 20 columns.\n\n2. **Identifying the Pattern**:\n   - The positions of the \"✅\" symbols in the grid are as follows:\n     - Row 2, Column 16\n     - Row 3, Column 17\n     - Row 4, Column 6\n     - Row 5, Column 9\n     - Row 6, Column 4\n     - Row 7, Column 12\n     - Row 8, Column 8\n     - Row 9, Column 5\n     - Row 10, Column 13\n     - Row 11, Column 10\n     - Row 12, Column 7\n     - Row 13, Column 15\n     - Row 14, Column 10\n     - Row 15, Column 13\n     - Row 16, Column 2\n     - Row 17, Column 3\n     - Row 18, Column 19\n     - Row 19, Column 15\n     - Row 20, Column 17\n\n3. **Pattern Analysis**:\n   - The pattern does not follow a simple arithmetic or geometric sequence. However, it seems to be a permutation of numbers from 1 to 20.\n   - The sequence of column numbers where \"✅\" appears is: 16, 17, 6, 9, 4, 12, 8, 5, 13, 10, 7, 15, 10, 13, 2, 3, 19, 15, 17.\n   - Notice that the sequence of column numbers is a permutation of numbers from 1 to 20, with some numbers missing and some repeated.\n\n4. **Filling the Missing Value**:\n   - The missing \"✅\" is in Row 18, Column 18.\n   - The sequence of column numbers is missing the number 18, which fits the pattern of using each number from 1 to 20 exactly once.\n\n5. **Final Grid**:\n   - We fill in the missing \"✅\" at Row 18, Column 18.\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n```\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n```\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌"
