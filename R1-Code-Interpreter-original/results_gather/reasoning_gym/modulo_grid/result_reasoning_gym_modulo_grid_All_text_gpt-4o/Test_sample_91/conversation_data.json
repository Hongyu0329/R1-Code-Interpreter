    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing value represented by the question mark.\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   - The grid is a 20x20 matrix.\n   - The pattern involves a diagonal line of check marks (✅) moving from the bottom-left to the top-right.\n   - The position of the check marks seems to follow a consistent pattern where each check mark is one position to the right and one position up from the previous one.\n\n2. **Analyze the Diagonal:**\n   - The first check mark is at the bottom-left corner (row 19, column 0).\n   - The next check mark is at (row 18, column 1).\n   - This pattern continues, moving diagonally up and to the right.\n\n3. **Determine the Missing Value:**\n   - The question mark is located at (row 1, column 12).\n   - Following the pattern, the check mark should be at (row 1, column 12) because the diagonal pattern places a check mark at each position where the row index plus the column index equals 19.\n\n4. **Fill in the Grid:**\n   - Replace the question mark with a check mark (✅) at the position (row 1, column 12).\n\n5. **Verify the Pattern:**\n   - Check that the pattern holds for all other positions in the grid, confirming that the diagonal line of check marks is consistent.\n\nThe completed grid with the question mark filled in is:\n\n```\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n```\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n>>>"
