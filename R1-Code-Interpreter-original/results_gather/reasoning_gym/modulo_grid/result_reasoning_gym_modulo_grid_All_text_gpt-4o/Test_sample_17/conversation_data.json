    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid. Let's analyze the given grid step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**:\n   - The grid is a 20x20 matrix filled with '❌' and '✅'.\n   - The '✅' symbols appear to follow a diagonal pattern.\n\n2. **Pattern Identification**:\n   - Observing the positions of '✅', we notice that they appear to form a diagonal line from the top-left to the bottom-right.\n   - The positions of '✅' in each row seem to follow a consistent pattern: they appear to be shifting one column to the right as we move down each row.\n\n3. **Pattern Formula**:\n   - If we denote the row index as `i` (starting from 0) and the column index as `j`, the pattern for '✅' can be described as:\n     - `j = (i + 2) % 20`\n   - This formula accounts for the diagonal shift and wraps around using modulo 20 to fit within the grid's width.\n\n4. **Filling the Grid**:\n   - Using the identified pattern, we can fill in the grid, including the position marked with a question mark.\n\n5. **Final Grid**:\n   - Applying the pattern to the entire grid, we fill in the missing '✅' at the position of the question mark.\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n```\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n```\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n>>>"
