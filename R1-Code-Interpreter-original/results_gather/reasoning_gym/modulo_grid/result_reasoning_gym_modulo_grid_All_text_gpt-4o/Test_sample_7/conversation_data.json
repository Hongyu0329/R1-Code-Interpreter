    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing value represented by the question mark.\n\n1. **Examine the Grid:**\n   - The grid is a 20x20 matrix filled with \"❌\" and \"✅\".\n   - The \"✅\" symbols appear to form a diagonal pattern.\n\n2. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   - The \"✅\" symbols are not placed randomly; they follow a specific pattern.\n   - Observing the positions of \"✅\" in each row:\n     - Row 1: Column 2\n     - Row 2: Column 1\n     - Row 3: Column 12\n     - Row 4: Column 11\n     - Row 5: Column 10\n     - Row 6: Column 9\n     - Row 7: Column 8\n     - Row 8: Column 7\n     - Row 9: Column 6\n     - Row 10: Column 5\n     - Row 11: Column 4\n     - Row 12: Column 3\n     - Row 13: Column 2\n     - Row 14: Column 1\n     - Row 15: Column 12\n     - Row 16: Column 11\n     - Row 17: Column 10\n     - Row 18: Column 9\n     - Row 19: Column 8\n     - Row 20: Column 7\n\n3. **Determine the Pattern:**\n   - The pattern is a repeating sequence of columns: 2, 1, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3.\n   - This sequence repeats every 12 rows.\n\n4. **Fill in the Missing Value:**\n   - The question mark is in row 14, column 12.\n   - According to the pattern, row 14 should have a \"✅\" in column 1, which matches the observed pattern.\n\n5. **Complete the Grid:**\n   - Replace the question mark with \"❌\" because column 12 in row 14 does not match the pattern.\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n```\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n```\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌"
