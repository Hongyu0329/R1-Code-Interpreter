    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing value represented by the question mark.\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**: The grid is a 20x20 matrix filled with \"❌\" and \"✅\" symbols. The \"✅\" symbols appear to form a diagonal pattern.\n\n2. **Pattern Identification**:\n   - The first row has a \"✅\" at the third position.\n   - The second row has a \"✅\" at the second position from the end.\n   - The third row has a \"✅\" at the first position.\n   - The fourth row has a \"✅\" at the second position from the end.\n   - The fifth row has a \"✅\" at the third position from the end.\n   - This pattern continues, with the \"✅\" moving one position to the left in each subsequent row until it reaches the first column, then it starts moving one position to the right in each subsequent row.\n\n3. **Pattern Description**:\n   - The \"✅\" symbol moves diagonally from the top-left to the bottom-right, wrapping around when it reaches the edges of the grid.\n   - Specifically, the position of the \"✅\" in each row can be described as follows:\n     - For rows 1 to 10, the \"✅\" moves from the third column to the first column.\n     - For rows 11 to 20, the \"✅\" moves from the first column to the third column.\n\n4. **Filling the Grid**:\n   - The question mark is located in the 9th row and 12th column.\n   - According to the pattern, the \"✅\" should be in the 8th column of the 9th row.\n\n5. **Final Grid**:\n   - Replace the question mark with \"❌\" because the \"✅\" should be in the 8th column of the 9th row.\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n```\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n```\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌"
