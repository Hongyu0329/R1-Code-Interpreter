    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing part, which is represented by a question mark. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 20x20, with each cell either marked with a \"❌\" or a \"✅\".\n\n2. **Identifying the Pattern**: \n   - The \"✅\" marks seem to follow a diagonal pattern. \n   - Let's list the positions of the \"✅\" marks:\n     - Row 2, Column 19\n     - Row 3, Column 10 and Column 20\n     - Row 4, Column 7\n     - Row 7, Column 4 and Column 13\n     - Row 8, Column 15\n     - Row 10, Column 3\n     - Row 12, Column 19\n     - Row 14, Column 7\n     - Row 15, Column 8 and Column 18\n     - Row 18, Column 15\n     - Row 19, Column 2 and Column 11\n   - Observing these positions, it seems that the \"✅\" marks are placed in positions where the sum of the row and column indices is a multiple of a certain number.\n\n3. **Finding the Pattern**:\n   - Let's calculate the sum of the row and column indices for each \"✅\":\n     - (2+19) = 21\n     - (3+10) = 13, (3+20) = 23\n     - (4+7) = 11\n     - (7+4) = 11, (7+13) = 20\n     - (8+15) = 23\n     - (10+3) = 13\n     - (12+19) = 31\n     - (14+7) = 21\n     - (15+8) = 23, (15+18) = 33\n     - (18+15) = 33\n     - (19+2) = 21, (19+11) = 30\n   - The sums are: 21, 13, 23, 11, 20, 31, 33, 30.\n   - The pattern is not immediately obvious, but it seems that the \"✅\" marks are placed in positions where the sum of the row and column indices is a prime number.\n\n4. **Filling the Question Mark**:\n   - The question mark is at Row 1, Column 4.\n   - The sum of the indices is 1 + 4 = 5, which is a prime number.\n   - Therefore, the question mark should be replaced with a \"✅\".\n\n5. **Completing the Grid**:\n   - Replace the question mark with \"✅\" and keep the rest of the grid unchanged.\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n```\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n```\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌"
