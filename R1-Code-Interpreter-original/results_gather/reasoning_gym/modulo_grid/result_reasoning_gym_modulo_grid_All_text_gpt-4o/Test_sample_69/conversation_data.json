    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing value represented by the question mark.\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**: The grid is a 20x20 matrix with some cells marked with a \"✅\" and others with a \"❌\". We need to determine the pattern of the \"✅\" marks.\n\n2. **Identifying the Pattern**: \n   - The \"✅\" marks appear to be placed in a diagonal pattern. \n   - Observing the positions of the \"✅\" marks, we can see that they are placed in a sequence that seems to follow a specific order.\n\n3. **Position Analysis**:\n   - The positions of the \"✅\" marks are as follows:\n     - (1, 8)\n     - (2, 14)\n     - (3, 16)\n     - (4, 17)\n     - (5, 18)\n     - (6, 10)\n     - (7, 19)\n     - (8, 2)\n     - (9, 9)\n     - (10, 5)\n     - (11, 15)\n     - (12, 12)\n     - (13, 19)\n     - (14, 3)\n     - (15, 10)\n     - (16, 4)\n     - (17, 5)\n     - (18, 7)\n     - (19, 13)\n\n4. **Pattern Recognition**:\n   - The sequence of column numbers for each row seems to follow a pattern that is not immediately obvious. However, by examining the sequence, we can see that the column numbers are unique for each row, and they do not repeat.\n\n5. **Filling the Missing Value**:\n   - The missing value is in row 15, column 2. \n   - By examining the sequence, we can see that the column numbers for each row are unique and do not repeat. Therefore, the missing column number for row 15 should be the one that has not been used yet.\n   - The column numbers used so far are: 8, 14, 16, 17, 18, 10, 19, 2, 9, 5, 15, 12, 19, 3, 10, 4, 5, 7, 13.\n   - The only column number not used yet is 6.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The missing \"✅\" mark should be placed at row 15, column 6.\n\nTherefore, the completed grid with the missing value filled in is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n>>>"
