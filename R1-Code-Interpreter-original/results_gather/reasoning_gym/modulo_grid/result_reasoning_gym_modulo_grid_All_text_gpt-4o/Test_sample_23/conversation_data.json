    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing values. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 20 rows by 20 columns.\n\n2. **Pattern Recognition**: \n   - We observe that there is a diagonal pattern of '✅' moving from the top-left to the bottom-right of the grid.\n   - The '✅' appears to move one column to the right and one row down in each subsequent row.\n   - The pattern seems to repeat every 20 rows, which matches the grid's dimensions.\n\n3. **Pattern Analysis**:\n   - In the first row, the '✅' is at the 4th position.\n   - In the second row, the '✅' is at the 5th position.\n   - This pattern continues, with the '✅' moving one position to the right in each subsequent row.\n   - When the '✅' reaches the end of a row, it wraps around to the beginning of the next row.\n\n4. **Filling the Grid**:\n   - We need to fill in the missing '❔' in the grid using the identified pattern.\n   - In the 10th row, the '✅' should be at the 12th position, following the pattern.\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - Check the pattern consistency across the grid to ensure the identified pattern holds true for all rows.\n\nBy following these steps, we can fill in the missing '❔' in the grid. The completed grid is:\n\n```\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n```\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n>>>"
