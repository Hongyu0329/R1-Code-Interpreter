    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing value represented by the question mark (❔).\n\n1. **Observe the Grid:**\n   - The grid is composed of rows and columns filled with either ❌ or ✅.\n   - The pattern of ✅ seems to repeat every few rows.\n\n2. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   - Look at the rows with ✅ and see if there is a repeating pattern.\n   - Notice that every 6th column has a ✅ in every row.\n   - Additionally, every 4th row has a pattern of ✅ at every 3rd column starting from the 3rd column.\n\n3. **Verify the Pattern:**\n   - Check if the pattern holds for all rows and columns.\n   - The pattern of ✅ at every 6th column is consistent.\n   - The pattern of ✅ at every 3rd column in every 4th row is also consistent.\n\n4. **Apply the Pattern to the Missing Value:**\n   - The question mark is located in the 3rd row and 3rd column.\n   - According to the pattern, every 4th row (4, 8, 12, 16, etc.) has a ✅ at every 3rd column (3, 6, 9, etc.).\n   - Since the 3rd row is not a multiple of 4, the 3rd column should not have a ✅.\n\n5. **Fill in the Missing Value:**\n   - Based on the pattern, the missing value at the 3rd row and 3rd column should be ❌.\n\n6. **Complete the Grid:**\n   - The grid remains unchanged except for the filled-in value.\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n```\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n```\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n>>>"
