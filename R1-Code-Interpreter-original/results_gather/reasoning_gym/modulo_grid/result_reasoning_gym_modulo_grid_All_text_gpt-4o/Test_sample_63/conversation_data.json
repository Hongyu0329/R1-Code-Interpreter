    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing value represented by the question mark (❔).\n\n1. **Examine the Grid:**\n   - The grid is a 20x20 matrix.\n   - There are some cells marked with a checkmark (✅) and others with a cross (❌).\n   - The checkmarks appear to be in a diagonal pattern from the top right to the bottom left.\n\n2. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   - The first row with a checkmark is the 1st row, 18th column.\n   - The second row with a checkmark is the 2nd row, 19th column.\n   - The third row with a checkmark is the 3rd row, 20th column.\n   - The fourth row with a checkmark is the 18th row, 1st column.\n   - The fifth row with a checkmark is the 19th row, 2nd column.\n   - The sixth row with a checkmark is the 20th row, 3rd column.\n\n3. **Determine the Rule:**\n   - The pattern is a diagonal line from the top right to the bottom left.\n   - The position of the checkmark in each row is determined by the formula: Column = 21 - Row.\n\n4. **Apply the Pattern to the Question Mark:**\n   - The question mark is located at the 16th row.\n   - Using the pattern formula: Column = 21 - 16 = 5.\n   - Therefore, the checkmark should be in the 16th row, 5th column.\n\n5. **Fill in the Grid:**\n   - Replace the question mark with a checkmark in the 16th row, 5th column.\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n```\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n```\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌"
