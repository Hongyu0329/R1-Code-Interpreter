    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the question mark. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**: The grid is a 20x20 matrix filled with ❌ symbols, except for one ✅ symbol and one ❔ symbol. The ✅ symbol is located at the 2nd row and 7th column, and the ❔ symbol is located at the 17th row and 5th column.\n\n2. **Pattern Identification**: We need to determine the pattern that dictates the placement of the ✅ symbol. Since there is only one ✅ symbol, we need to hypothesize a pattern that could explain its position.\n\n3. **Possible Patterns**:\n   - **Diagonal Pattern**: One common pattern in such grids is a diagonal pattern. However, the ✅ is not on a main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right or top-right to bottom-left).\n   - **Arithmetic Sequence**: Another possibility is an arithmetic sequence in either rows or columns. The position of the ✅ is (2, 7), which doesn't immediately suggest a simple arithmetic sequence.\n   - **Geometric Pattern**: A geometric pattern could involve a specific formula or rule that places the ✅ at (2, 7).\n\n4. **Hypothesis**: Given the limited information, let's hypothesize that the pattern involves a simple arithmetic or geometric rule that places the ✅ at (2, 7) and the ❔ at (17, 5).\n\n5. **Pattern Verification**: To verify, let's consider a simple rule: the sum of the row and column indices equals a constant. For the ✅ at (2, 7), the sum is 2 + 7 = 9. For the ❔ at (17, 5), the sum is 17 + 5 = 22. These sums are not equal, so this rule doesn't apply.\n\n6. **Alternative Pattern**: Consider a pattern where the column index is a fixed offset from the row index. For the ✅ at (2, 7), the column index is 5 more than the row index (7 = 2 + 5). Applying this to the ❔ at (17, 5), the column index should be 17 + 5 = 22, but since the grid is only 20 columns wide, this doesn't fit.\n\n7. **Final Pattern**: Given the constraints, let's assume a pattern where the row index is incremented by a fixed number to determine the column index. For the ✅ at (2, 7), the column index is 7, which is 5 more than the row index. Applying this to the ❔ at (17, 5), the column index should be 17 + 5 = 22, but since this exceeds the grid width, the pattern might involve wrapping around or another adjustment.\n\n8. **Conclusion**: Given the limited information and the constraints of the grid, the most straightforward assumption is that the pattern involves a fixed offset that doesn't fit perfectly within the grid's dimensions. Therefore, the ❔ should be replaced with a ❌, as it doesn't fit the pattern established by the ✅.\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n>>>"
