    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing values. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Structure**: The grid is 20 rows by 20 columns, with some cells marked as \"✅\" and others as \"❌\". We need to determine the pattern that dictates where the \"✅\" marks appear.\n\n2. **Pattern Observation**:\n   - Look at the positions of the \"✅\" marks in the grid.\n   - Notice that the \"✅\" marks appear in a diagonal pattern, repeating every 4 rows and 5 columns.\n   - Specifically, the \"✅\" marks appear in the following positions:\n     - Row 2, Column 5\n     - Row 2, Column 13\n     - Row 3, Column 3\n     - Row 3, Column 8\n     - Row 3, Column 12\n     - Row 3, Column 17\n     - Row 5, Column 5\n     - Row 5, Column 13\n     - Row 6, Column 8\n     - Row 6, Column 17\n     - Row 8, Column 5\n     - Row 8, Column 13\n     - Row 9, Column 3\n     - Row 9, Column 8\n     - Row 9, Column 12\n     - Row 9, Column 17\n     - Row 11, Column 5\n     - Row 11, Column 13\n     - Row 12, Column 8\n     - Row 12, Column 17\n     - Row 14, Column 5\n     - Row 14, Column 13\n     - Row 15, Column 3\n     - Row 15, Column 8\n     - Row 15, Column 12\n     - Row 15, Column 17\n     - Row 17, Column 5\n     - Row 17, Column 13\n     - Row 18, Column 8\n     - Row 18, Column 17\n     - Row 20, Column 5\n     - Row 20, Column 13\n\n3. **Pattern Analysis**:\n   - The pattern repeats every 4 rows and 5 columns.\n   - The \"✅\" marks form a diagonal pattern that shifts down by 2 rows and 3 columns each time.\n\n4. **Filling the Missing Value**:\n   - The missing value is in Row 19, Column 5.\n   - According to the pattern, Row 19, Column 5 should be \"✅\" because it follows the diagonal pattern established by the previous rows.\n\n5. **Final Grid**:\n   - Fill in the missing value with \"✅\" at Row 19, Column 5.\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n```\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❔❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n```\n\nThe completed grid with the missing value filled in is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌"
