    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing value represented by the question mark.\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**: \n   - The grid is a 20x20 matrix.\n   - The grid is filled with '❌' and '✅'.\n   - The '✅' symbols appear to form a diagonal pattern.\n\n2. **Pattern Identification**:\n   - Observing the grid, the '✅' symbols appear to be placed in a diagonal line from the top right to the bottom left.\n   - The first '✅' is at position (0, 7), the second at (1, 6), the third at (2, 5), and so on.\n   - This suggests a pattern where the sum of the row index and column index is constant for each '✅'.\n\n3. **Mathematical Pattern**:\n   - For the first '✅' at (0, 7), the sum of indices is 0 + 7 = 7.\n   - For the second '✅' at (1, 6), the sum is 1 + 6 = 7.\n   - This pattern continues, indicating that the sum of the row and column indices for each '✅' is 7.\n\n4. **Filling the Grid**:\n   - To fill in the question mark, we need to find the position where the sum of the row and column indices is 7.\n   - The question mark is located at (9, 10).\n   - The sum of indices for (9, 10) is 9 + 10 = 19, which does not fit the pattern.\n   - Therefore, the question mark should be replaced with '❌' because it does not satisfy the condition for a '✅'.\n\n5. **Final Grid**:\n   - The grid remains unchanged except for replacing the question mark with '❌'.\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n```\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n```\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n>>>"
