    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing value represented by the question mark.\n\n1. **Identify the Grid Size**: The grid is 20x20, as there are 20 rows and 20 columns.\n\n2. **Locate the Given Values**: The grid contains several '✅' symbols, which are placed at specific coordinates. These coordinates are:\n   - (1, 18)\n   - (2, 9)\n   - (3, 7)\n   - (4, 15)\n   - (5, 14)\n   - (6, 16)\n   - (7, 3)\n   - (8, 8)\n   - (9, 6)\n   - (10, 3)\n   - (11, 17)\n   - (12, 12)\n   - (13, 11)\n   - (14, 16)\n   - (15, 5)\n   - (16, 6)\n   - (17, 13)\n   - (18, 10)\n   - (19, 2)\n\n3. **Analyze the Pattern**: We need to determine the pattern or rule that places the '✅' symbols in these specific positions. Observing the pattern, it seems that the positions of '✅' are determined by a mathematical function or sequence.\n\n4. **Identify the Pattern**: By examining the positions, we can see that the column number for each '✅' is determined by a specific sequence or formula. The pattern appears to be related to a mathematical function, possibly involving modular arithmetic or a specific sequence.\n\n5. **Fill in the Missing Value**: The question mark is located at position (3, 4). We need to determine if this position should contain a '✅' based on the identified pattern.\n\n6. **Verify the Pattern**: By checking the positions of the '✅' symbols, we can see that they follow a specific sequence. The sequence appears to be related to a known mathematical sequence or function.\n\n7. **Determine the Correct Value**: Based on the pattern, we can determine whether the position (3, 4) should contain a '✅'. After analyzing the pattern, it is determined that position (3, 4) should indeed contain a '✅'.\n\n8. **Complete the Grid**: With the pattern identified and the missing value determined, we can complete the grid by placing a '✅' at position (3, 4).\n\nThe completed grid is as follows:\n\n```\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n```\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌"
