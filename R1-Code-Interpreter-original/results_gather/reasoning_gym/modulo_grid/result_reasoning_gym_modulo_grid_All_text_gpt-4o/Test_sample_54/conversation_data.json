    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing value represented by the question mark.\n\n1. **Observation of the Grid:**\n   - The grid is a 20x20 matrix.\n   - The grid contains '✅' and '❌' symbols, with a few '✅' symbols scattered in a diagonal-like pattern.\n   - The question mark is located at row 14, column 14.\n\n2. **Identifying the Pattern:**\n   - Let's examine the positions of the '✅' symbols:\n     - Row 1, Column 5\n     - Row 2, Column 4\n     - Row 3, Column 3\n     - Row 4, Column 2\n     - Row 5, Column 1\n     - Row 6, Column 13\n     - Row 7, Column 12\n     - Row 8, Column 11\n     - Row 9, Column 10\n     - Row 10, Column 9\n     - Row 11, Column 8\n     - Row 12, Column 7\n     - Row 13, Column 6\n     - Row 14, Column 15 (question mark position)\n     - Row 15, Column 16\n     - Row 16, Column 17\n     - Row 17, Column 18\n     - Row 18, Column 19\n     - Row 19, Column 20\n     - Row 20, Column 11\n\n3. **Pattern Analysis:**\n   - The '✅' symbols form two diagonal lines:\n     - The first diagonal line starts from Row 1, Column 5 and goes to Row 5, Column 1.\n     - The second diagonal line starts from Row 6, Column 13 and goes to Row 20, Column 11.\n   - The question mark is located at Row 14, Column 15, which fits the pattern of the second diagonal line.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The question mark should be replaced with a '✅' to continue the pattern of the second diagonal line.\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   - Replace the question mark with '✅' and present the completed grid.\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n```\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n```\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌"
