    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the question marks. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 20 rows by 20 columns.\n\n2. **Identifying the Pattern**: \n   - We notice that there are some cells marked with a ✅ symbol. These appear to be following a specific pattern.\n   - Let's list the positions of the ✅ symbols:\n     - Row 2, Column 3\n     - Row 2, Column 17\n     - Row 4, Column 9\n     - Row 6, Column 3\n     - Row 6, Column 17\n     - Row 8, Column 9\n     - Row 10, Column 3\n     - Row 10, Column 17\n     - Row 12, Column 8 (with a ❔)\n     - Row 14, Column 3\n     - Row 14, Column 17\n     - Row 16, Column 9\n     - Row 18, Column 3\n     - Row 18, Column 17\n     - Row 20, Column 9\n\n3. **Pattern Analysis**:\n   - The pattern seems to repeat every 4 rows, with the positions of the ✅ symbols alternating between columns 3, 9, and 17.\n   - Specifically:\n     - Rows 2, 6, 10, 14, 18 have ✅ in columns 3 and 17.\n     - Rows 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 have ✅ in column 9.\n\n4. **Filling in the Question Mark**:\n   - The question mark is located at Row 12, Column 4. Based on the pattern, Row 12 should have a ✅ in Column 9, which is already present. The question mark is not in a position where a ✅ should be placed according to the pattern.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The grid is already complete according to the identified pattern. The question mark does not need to be replaced with a ✅.\n\nTherefore, the completed grid is:\n\n```\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❔❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n```\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❔❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌"
