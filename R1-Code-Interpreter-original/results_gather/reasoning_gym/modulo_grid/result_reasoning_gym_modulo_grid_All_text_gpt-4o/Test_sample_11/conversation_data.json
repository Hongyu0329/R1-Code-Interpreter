    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing value represented by the question mark.\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**: The grid is a 20x20 matrix with '❌' and '✅' symbols. The '✅' symbols appear to follow a diagonal pattern.\n\n2. **Pattern Identification**:\n   - The '✅' symbols start from the bottom-left corner and move towards the top-right corner.\n   - Observing the positions of '✅', they appear to be on a diagonal line that moves one step up and one step to the right in each subsequent row.\n   - The positions of '✅' in each row are as follows:\n     - Row 1: Column 1\n     - Row 2: Column 2\n     - Row 3: Column 3\n     - ...\n     - Row 12: Column 12\n     - Row 13: Column 13\n     - Row 14: Column 14\n     - Row 15: Column 15\n     - Row 16: Column 16\n     - Row 17: Column 17\n     - Row 18: Column 18\n     - Row 19: Column 19\n     - Row 20: Column 20\n\n3. **Filling the Grid**:\n   - The pattern suggests that the '✅' symbol should be placed in the 15th row and 15th column, where the question mark is located.\n\n4. **Final Grid**:\n   - Replace the question mark with '✅' in the 15th row and 15th column.\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n```\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n```\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n>>>"
