    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the question mark. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 20 rows by 20 columns.\n\n2. **Identifying the Pattern**: \n   - We notice that there are \"✅\" symbols placed in specific positions in the grid.\n   - Let's list the positions of the \"✅\" symbols:\n     - Row 2, Column 9\n     - Row 2, Column 19\n     - Row 4, Column 3\n     - Row 4, Column 13\n     - Row 8, Column 7\n     - Row 8, Column 17\n     - Row 10, Column 8\n     - Row 10, Column 18\n     - Row 12, Column 9\n     - Row 12, Column 19\n     - Row 14, Column 3\n     - Row 14, Column 13\n     - Row 18, Column 7\n     - Row 18, Column 17\n     - Row 20, Column 8\n     - Row 20, Column 18\n\n3. **Pattern Analysis**:\n   - The \"✅\" symbols appear in pairs in each row, and the columns they appear in are separated by 10 columns.\n   - The rows where \"✅\" symbols appear are: 2, 4, 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, and 20.\n   - The columns where \"✅\" symbols appear are: 3, 7, 8, 9, 13, 17, 18, and 19.\n   - The pattern seems to be that the \"✅\" symbols are placed in every second row starting from row 2, and they appear in two columns per row, separated by 10 columns.\n\n4. **Filling the Question Mark**:\n   - The question mark is located at Row 5, Column 1.\n   - Since the pattern involves placing \"✅\" symbols in every second row starting from row 2, and row 5 is not part of this sequence, the question mark should be replaced with a \"❌\".\n\n5. **Final Grid**:\n   - The grid remains unchanged except for replacing the question mark with a \"❌\".\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n```\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n```\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n"
