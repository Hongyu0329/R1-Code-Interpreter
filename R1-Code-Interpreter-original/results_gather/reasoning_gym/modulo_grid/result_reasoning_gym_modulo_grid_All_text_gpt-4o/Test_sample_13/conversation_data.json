    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing values. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Structure**: The grid is 20 rows by 20 columns, with some cells marked as \"✅\" and others as \"❌\". There are also some cells marked with \"❔\" which need to be filled.\n\n2. **Pattern Observation**:\n   - The pattern of \"✅\" appears to repeat every 6 rows. \n   - In each 6-row block, the pattern of \"✅\" is consistent:\n     - Row 1: \"✅\" at column 4 and 13.\n     - Row 2: \"✅\" at column 7 and 16.\n     - Row 3: \"✅\" at column 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, and 20.\n     - Row 4: \"✅\" at column 4 and 13.\n     - Row 5: \"✅\" at column 7 and 16.\n     - Row 6: \"✅\" at column 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, and 20.\n\n3. **Filling the Grid**:\n   - The grid is divided into blocks of 6 rows, and the pattern repeats every 6 rows.\n   - The 10th row is completely empty, which fits the pattern as the 6th row in the repeating sequence is also empty.\n   - The 11th row, which contains the \"❔\", should follow the pattern of the 1st row in the sequence, which has \"✅\" at column 4 and 13.\n\n4. **Final Grid**:\n   - We fill in the \"❔\" in the 11th row with \"✅\" at column 4 and 13, following the pattern.\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n```\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n```\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n>>>"
