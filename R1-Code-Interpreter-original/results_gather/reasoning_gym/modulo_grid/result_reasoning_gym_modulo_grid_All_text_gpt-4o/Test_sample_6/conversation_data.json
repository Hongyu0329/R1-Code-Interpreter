    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing value. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 20 rows by 20 columns.\n\n2. **Pattern Identification**:\n   - Each row contains exactly one '✅'.\n   - The position of '✅' in each row seems to follow a specific pattern.\n\n3. **Observing the Pattern**:\n   - In the first row, '✅' is at the 3rd position.\n   - In the second row, '✅' is at the 4th position.\n   - In the third row, '✅' is at the 5th position.\n   - This suggests that the position of '✅' in each row increases by 1 as we move down each row.\n\n4. **Generalizing the Pattern**:\n   - If we denote the row number as \\( n \\) (starting from 0), the position of '✅' in the nth row is \\( n + 3 \\).\n\n5. **Applying the Pattern**:\n   - For the 19th row (20th row in 1-based index), the position of '✅' should be \\( 19 + 3 = 22 \\).\n   - Since the grid is only 20 columns wide, this suggests a wrap-around or modulo operation.\n   - Therefore, the position of '✅' in the 19th row is \\( (19 + 3) \\mod 20 = 2 \\).\n\n6. **Filling the Grid**:\n   - Place '✅' in the 2nd position of the 19th row.\n\n7. **Final Grid**:\n   - The grid is now complete with the identified pattern.\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n```\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅\n❌✅❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n```\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅\n❌✅❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n>>>"
