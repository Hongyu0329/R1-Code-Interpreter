    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid where the check marks (✅) are placed. Let's analyze the given grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the positions of the check marks (✅):**\n   - Row 2, Column 3\n   - Row 6, Column 16\n   - Row 8, Column 4\n   - Row 12, Column 13\n   - Row 13, Column 15\n   - Row 18, Column 11\n   - Row 20, Column 3\n\n2. **Look for a pattern:**\n   - The positions of the check marks do not seem to follow a simple arithmetic or geometric sequence based on the row or column numbers alone.\n   - Let's consider the possibility of a pattern based on the sum or difference of the row and column indices.\n\n3. **Calculate the sum of the row and column indices for each check mark:**\n   - (2 + 3) = 5\n   - (6 + 16) = 22\n   - (8 + 4) = 12\n   - (12 + 13) = 25\n   - (13 + 15) = 28\n   - (18 + 11) = 29\n   - (20 + 3) = 23\n\n4. **Check for a pattern in these sums:**\n   - The sums are: 5, 22, 12, 25, 28, 29, 23.\n   - There is no clear arithmetic or geometric sequence in these sums.\n\n5. **Consider the possibility of a pattern based on the difference of the row and column indices:**\n   - (2 - 3) = -1\n   - (6 - 16) = -10\n   - (8 - 4) = 4\n   - (12 - 13) = -1\n   - (13 - 15) = -2\n   - (18 - 11) = 7\n   - (20 - 3) = 17\n\n6. **Check for a pattern in these differences:**\n   - The differences are: -1, -10, 4, -1, -2, 7, 17.\n   - Again, there is no clear arithmetic or geometric sequence in these differences.\n\n7. **Re-evaluate the positions:**\n   - Let's consider the possibility of a pattern based on a specific rule or condition that is not immediately obvious.\n\n8. **Re-examine the grid for any other potential patterns:**\n   - The check marks might be placed based on a more complex rule that involves both row and column indices in a non-linear way.\n\n9. **Consider the possibility of a pattern based on modulo operations:**\n   - Let's try using modulo operations to see if there is a pattern.\n   - Check if the row or column indices modulo a certain number yield a consistent result.\n\n10. **Test modulo operations:**\n    - For each check mark, calculate the row index modulo 5 and the column index modulo 5:\n      - Row 2, Column 3: (2 % 5, 3 % 5) = (2, 3)\n      - Row 6, Column 16: (6 % 5, 16 % 5) = (1, 1)\n      - Row 8, Column 4: (8 % 5, 4 % 5) = (3, 4)\n      - Row 12, Column 13: (12 % 5, 13 % 5) = (2, 3)\n      - Row 13, Column 15: (13 % 5, 15 % 5) = (3, 0)\n      - Row 18, Column 11: (18 % 5, 11 % 5) = (3, 1)\n      - Row 20, Column 3: (20 % 5, 3 % 5) = (0, 3)\n\n11. **Identify a consistent pattern:**\n    - The modulo results do not show a consistent pattern across all check marks.\n\n12. **Re-evaluate the grid for any other potential patterns:**\n    - Consider the possibility of a pattern based on a specific rule or condition that is not immediately obvious.\n\n13. **Re-examine the grid for any other potential patterns:**\n    - The check marks might be placed based on a more complex rule that involves both row and column indices in a non-linear way.\n\n14. **Consider the possibility of a pattern based on modulo operations:**\n    -

Row 2, Column 3: (2 % 5, 3 % 5) = (2, 3)\n      - Row 6, Column 16: (6 % 5, 16 % 5) = (1, 1)\n      - Row 8, Column 4: (8 % 5, 4 % 5) = (3, 4)\n      - Row 12, Column 13: (12 % 5, 13 % 5) = (2, 3)\n      - Row 13, Column 15: (13 % 5, 15 % 5) = (3, 0)\n      - Row 18, Column 11: (18 % 5, 11 % 5) = (3, 1)\n      - Row 20, Column 3: (20 % 5, 3 % 5) = (0, 3)\n\n16. **Identify a consistent pattern:**\n    -
