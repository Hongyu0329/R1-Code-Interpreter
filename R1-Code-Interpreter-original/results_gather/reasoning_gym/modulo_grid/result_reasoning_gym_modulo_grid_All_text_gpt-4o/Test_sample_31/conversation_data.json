    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid. Let's analyze the given grid step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 20 rows by 20 columns.\n\n2. **Pattern Observation**:\n   - The grid has a diagonal pattern of '✅' from the top-left to the bottom-right.\n   - The '✅' appears to move one step down and one step to the right in each subsequent row.\n\n3. **Pattern Analysis**:\n   - In the first row, the '✅' is at the 4th position.\n   - In the second row, the '✅' is at the 3rd position.\n   - In the third row, the '✅' is at the 2nd position.\n   - In the fourth row, the '✅' is at the 1st position.\n   - From the fifth row onwards, the '✅' starts moving from the 20th position back to the 1st position, creating a diagonal from bottom-left to top-right.\n\n4. **Pattern Formula**:\n   - For rows 1 to 4, the position of '✅' is decreasing by 1 each time.\n   - From row 5 onwards, the position of '✅' is increasing by 1 each time, starting from the 20th position.\n\n5. **Filling the Grid**:\n   - For rows 1 to 4, the positions are 4, 3, 2, 1 respectively.\n   - For rows 5 to 20, the positions are 20, 19, 18, ..., 2, 1 respectively.\n\n6. **Completing the Grid**:\n   - The '?' in the grid is in the 7th row and 10th column. According to the pattern, the '✅' should be in the 11th position in the 7th row.\n\nBy following this pattern, we can fill in the grid:\n\n```\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n```\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n>>>"
