    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing value represented by the question mark. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**: The grid is a 20x20 matrix with '❌' and '✅' symbols. The '✅' symbols appear to follow a specific pattern.\n\n2. **Identifying the Pattern**: \n   - The '✅' symbols are located at the following coordinates (row, column):\n     - (1, 7)\n     - (2, 4)\n     - (3, 3)\n     - (4, 2)\n     - (5, 12)\n     - (6, 6)\n     - (7, 2)\n     - (8, 9)\n     - (9, 15)\n     - (10, 8)\n     - (11, 12)\n     - (12, 5)\n     - (13, 10)\n     - (14, 18)\n     - (15, 14)\n     - (16, 9)\n     - (17, 17)\n     - (18, 16)\n     - (19, 13)\n\n3. **Pattern Recognition**:\n   - Observing the pattern, it seems that the '✅' symbols are placed in a sequence that might be related to a mathematical function or sequence.\n   - The sequence of column numbers for each row is: 7, 4, 3, 2, 12, 6, 2, 9, 15, 8, 12, 5, 10, 18, 14, 9, 17, 16, 13.\n   - This sequence does not immediately suggest a simple arithmetic or geometric progression, but it does seem to have a cyclical or modular pattern.\n\n4. **Filling the Missing Value**:\n   - The missing value is at row 5, column 20.\n   - By examining the sequence, we notice that the column numbers are not strictly increasing or decreasing, but they do repeat certain values.\n   - The sequence of column numbers for the first 19 rows is: 7, 4, 3, 2, 12, 6, 2, 9, 15, 8, 12, 5, 10, 18, 14, 9, 17, 16, 13.\n   - The missing value at row 5 should follow the pattern observed in the sequence.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The pattern suggests that the column number for row 5 should be 20, as it is the only missing number in the sequence that fits the observed pattern.\n\nTherefore, the completed grid with the missing value filled in is:\n\n```\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n```\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌"
