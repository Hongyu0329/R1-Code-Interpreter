    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing value represented by the question mark. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Structure**: The grid is 20 rows by 20 columns, filled with ❌ (crosses) and ✅ (checks), with one ❔ (question mark) indicating the missing value we need to determine.\n\n2. **Pattern Identification**:\n   - The grid has a repeating pattern of ✅s in certain rows and columns.\n   - Rows 4, 10, and 16 have a pattern where every second column is a ✅, starting from column 2.\n   - Rows 2, 6, 8, 12, 14, 18, and 20 have a pattern where every 5th column is a ✅, starting from column 4.\n\n3. **Question Mark Location**:\n   - The question mark is located in the second row and second column.\n\n4. **Pattern Application**:\n   - For row 2, the pattern is that every 5th column starting from column 4 is a ✅. This means columns 4, 9, 14, and 19 are ✅ in row 2.\n   - Since column 2 does not fall into this pattern, it should be ❌.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The question mark should be replaced with a ❌ based on the identified pattern.\n\nNow, let's present the completed grid with the question mark replaced:\n\n```\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n```\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n>>>"
