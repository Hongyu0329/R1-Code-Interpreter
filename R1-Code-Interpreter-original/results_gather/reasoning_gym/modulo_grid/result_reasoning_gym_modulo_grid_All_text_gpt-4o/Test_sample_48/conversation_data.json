    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing value represented by the question mark.\n\n1. **Examine the Grid:**\n   - The grid is composed of 20 rows and 20 columns.\n   - The grid contains two symbols: ✅ and ❌.\n   - The first row is entirely filled with ✅.\n   - The subsequent rows have a pattern where the second column is always ✅, and the rest of the columns have a mix of ✅ and ❌.\n\n2. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   - The second column in every row is always ✅.\n   - The pattern in the grid seems to repeat every 6 rows. This is evident from the fact that rows 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20 have the same pattern.\n   - Similarly, rows 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19 have the same pattern.\n   - The pattern in the grid is alternating between two types of rows after the first row.\n\n3. **Determine the Pattern for Each Row Type:**\n   - **Type 1 Rows (e.g., Row 2, 4, 6, etc.):**\n     - Column 2 is ✅.\n     - Column 14 is ✅.\n   - **Type 2 Rows (e.g., Row 3, 5, 7, etc.):**\n     - Column 2 is ✅.\n     - Columns 6, 8, 12, 14, 18, and 20 are ✅.\n\n4. **Fill in the Missing Value:**\n   - The row with the question mark is Row 8, which is a Type 1 row.\n   - In Type 1 rows, columns 2 and 14 are ✅.\n   - Therefore, the question mark in Row 8, Column 20 should be ❌.\n\n5. **Complete the Grid:**\n   - Based on the identified pattern, fill in the grid with the correct symbols.\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n```\n✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n```\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅✅\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n>>>"
