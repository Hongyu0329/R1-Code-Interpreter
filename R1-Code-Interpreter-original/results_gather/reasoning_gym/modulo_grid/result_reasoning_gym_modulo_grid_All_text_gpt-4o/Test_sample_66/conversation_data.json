    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing value represented by the question mark (❔).\n\n1. **Observation of the Grid:**\n   - The grid is a 20x20 matrix.\n   - The grid contains two symbols: ❌ and ✅.\n   - The ✅ symbols form a diagonal pattern from the bottom-left to the top-right of the grid.\n\n2. **Pattern Analysis:**\n   - The position of the ✅ symbols seems to follow a consistent pattern.\n   - Starting from the bottom-left corner (row 11, column 1), the ✅ moves one step up and one step to the right in each subsequent row.\n   - This pattern continues until it reaches the top-right corner (row 1, column 11).\n\n3. **Mathematical Representation:**\n   - The position of the ✅ in each row can be represented as follows:\n     - Row 1: Column 11\n     - Row 2: Column 10\n     - Row 3: Column 9\n     - ...\n     - Row 11: Column 1\n   - The column index for the ✅ in each row is given by the formula: Column = 12 - Row.\n\n4. **Filling in the Missing Value:**\n   - The question mark (❔) is located at row 16.\n   - Using the formula, the column index for row 16 is: Column = 12 - 16 = -4.\n   - However, since the grid is 20x20, the pattern should wrap around or continue in a consistent manner.\n   - Observing the pattern, after reaching the top-right corner, the pattern continues from the bottom-left corner again.\n   - Therefore, for row 16, the column index should be 6 (since the pattern repeats every 20 rows).\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The question mark (❔) should be replaced with a ✅ at row 16, column 6.\n\n6. **Final Grid:**\n   - Replace the ❔ with ✅ at the identified position.\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n```\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n```\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n"
