    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing values. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Structure**: The grid is 20 rows by 20 columns, filled with ❌, ✅, and a single ❔.\n\n2. **Pattern Recognition**:\n   - Observing the grid, we see that the ✅ symbols appear in a regular pattern.\n   - In each row where ✅ appears, they are located at columns 3, 9, and 15.\n   - This pattern repeats every 2 rows, with the rows in between filled entirely with ❌.\n\n3. **Pattern Analysis**:\n   - The rows with ✅ are: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20.\n   - The columns with ✅ in these rows are consistently 3, 9, and 15.\n\n4. **Filling the Grid**:\n   - The ❔ is located at row 16, column 19.\n   - Since row 16 is one of the rows where the pattern of ✅ appears, and column 19 does not match the pattern columns (3, 9, 15), the ❔ should be replaced with ❌.\n\n5. **Final Grid**:\n   - Replace the ❔ with ❌ to complete the grid.\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n```\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n```\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n>>>"
