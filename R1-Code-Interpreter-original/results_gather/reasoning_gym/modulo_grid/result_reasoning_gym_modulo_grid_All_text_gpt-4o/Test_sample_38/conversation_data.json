    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing value represented by the question mark (❔).\n\n1. **Examine the Grid:**\n   - The grid is 20x20, filled mostly with ❌, except for some ✅ and one ❔.\n   - The ✅ symbols appear to be placed in a specific pattern.\n\n2. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   - Look at the rows and columns where ✅ appears:\n     - Row 2, Column 6\n     - Row 3, Column 11\n     - Row 5, Column 6\n     - Row 6, Column 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20\n     - Row 8, Column 6\n     - Row 9, Column 11\n     - Row 11, Column 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18\n     - Row 14, Column 6\n     - Row 15, Column 11\n     - Row 17, Column 6\n     - Row 18, Column 11\n     - Row 20, Column 6\n\n3. **Analyze the Pattern:**\n   - The pattern seems to be based on a repeating cycle of rows and columns.\n   - Rows with a single ✅: 2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20\n   - Rows with multiple ✅: 6, 11\n   - The columns for rows with a single ✅ are either 6 or 11.\n   - Rows 6 and 11 have a pattern of every third column starting from 2 and 3, respectively.\n\n4. **Determine the Missing Value:**\n   - The ❔ is located at Row 4, Column 5.\n   - Check the pattern for rows with a single ✅: Row 4 should follow the pattern of having a ✅ in either Column 6 or 11.\n   - Since Row 4 is not part of the rows with multiple ✅, it should have a single ✅.\n   - The pattern suggests that Row 4 should have a ✅ in Column 6.\n\n5. **Fill in the Grid:**\n   - Replace the ❔ with a ✅ at Row 4, Column 6.\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n```\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n```\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌"
