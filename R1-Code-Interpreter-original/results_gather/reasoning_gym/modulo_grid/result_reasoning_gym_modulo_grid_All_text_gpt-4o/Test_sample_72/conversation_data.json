    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing value represented by the question mark (❔).\n\n1. **Observation of the Grid:**\n   - The grid is a 20x20 matrix.\n   - There are '✅' marks forming a diagonal pattern from the top right to the bottom left.\n   - The '✅' marks appear to be moving one step down and one step left in each subsequent row.\n\n2. **Pattern Recognition:**\n   - The first '✅' is located at the 1st row, 11th column.\n   - The second '✅' is at the 2nd row, 10th column.\n   - The third '✅' is at the 3rd row, 9th column.\n   - This pattern continues, with each '✅' moving one column to the left and one row down.\n\n3. **Mathematical Pattern:**\n   - The position of '✅' in each row can be described as follows:\n     - For the nth row, the '✅' is located at the (21-n)th column.\n   - This means that for the 5th row, the '✅' should be at the (21-5) = 16th column.\n\n4. **Filling in the Grid:**\n   - According to the pattern, the '✅' for the 5th row should be placed in the 16th column.\n\n5. **Final Grid:**\n   - We replace the question mark (❔) in the 5th row with a '✅' at the 16th column.\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n```\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n```\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n>>>"
