    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing value represented by the question mark (❔).\n\n1. **Observation of the Grid:**\n   - The grid is a 20x20 matrix.\n   - The grid contains two symbols: ❌ and ✅.\n   - The ✅ symbols appear to form a diagonal pattern from the top right to the bottom left.\n\n2. **Pattern Analysis:**\n   - The first row has a ✅ at the 8th position.\n   - The second row has a ✅ at the 7th position.\n   - The third row has a ✅ at the 6th position.\n   - This pattern continues, with each subsequent row having a ✅ one position to the left of the previous row's ✅.\n\n3. **Mathematical Pattern:**\n   - The position of the ✅ in each row can be described as follows:\n     - In the nth row (starting from 0), the ✅ is at the position (20 - n - 1).\n   - This means that the position of the ✅ in each row is decreasing by 1 as we move down the rows.\n\n4. **Filling in the Missing Value:**\n   - The question mark (❔) is located in the 20th row (index 19) and the 4th column (index 3).\n   - According to the pattern, in the 20th row, the ✅ should be at position (20 - 19 - 1) = 0.\n   - Therefore, the question mark should be replaced with a ❌.\n\n5. **Final Grid:**\n   - The grid remains unchanged except for the replacement of the question mark with a ❌.\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n```\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n```\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n>>>"
