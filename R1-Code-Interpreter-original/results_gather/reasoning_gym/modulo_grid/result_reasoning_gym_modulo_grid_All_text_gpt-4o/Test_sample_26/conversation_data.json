    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing values. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Structure**: The grid is a 20x20 matrix, with most cells marked as ❌, and a few cells marked as ✅. There is one cell marked as ❔, which we need to determine.\n\n2. **Pattern Identification**:\n   - Observing the positions of the ✅ marks, we notice that they form a diagonal pattern.\n   - The first ✅ is at position (0, 7), the second at (1, 8), the third at (2, 9), and so on.\n   - This suggests that the pattern is a diagonal line where the column index is 7 more than the row index.\n\n3. **Pattern Formula**:\n   - The pattern can be described by the formula: Column Index = Row Index + 7.\n   - This means for any row `i`, the ✅ should be at column `i + 7`.\n\n4. **Filling the Grid**:\n   - We need to fill the grid according to this pattern.\n   - For each row `i`, place a ✅ at column `i + 7`.\n   - The ❔ is at position (6, 1). According to the pattern, for row 6, the ✅ should be at column 6 + 7 = 13.\n\n5. **Final Grid**:\n   - Replace the ❔ with ❌ because the pattern does not place a ✅ at (6, 1).\n   - Ensure all other positions follow the identified pattern.\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n```\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n```\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n>>>"
