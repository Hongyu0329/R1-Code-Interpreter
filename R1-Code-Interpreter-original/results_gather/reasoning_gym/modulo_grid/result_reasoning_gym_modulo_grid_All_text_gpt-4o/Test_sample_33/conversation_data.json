    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid where the \"✅\" symbols are placed. Let's analyze the given grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the positions of \"✅\" in the grid:**\n   - The grid is 20 rows by 20 columns.\n   - The positions of \"✅\" in the grid are as follows:\n     - Row 2, Column 11\n     - Row 3, Column 6\n     - Row 3, Column 13\n     - Row 3, Column 20\n     - Row 4, Column 9\n     - Row 5, Column 7\n     - Row 5, Column 13\n     - Row 6, Column 3\n     - Row 6, Column 17\n     - Row 7, Column 5\n     - Row 7, Column 11\n     - Row 7, Column 19\n     - Row 9, Column 4\n     - Row 9, Column 10\n     - Row 9, Column 17\n     - Row 10, Column 13\n     - Row 11, Column 2\n     - Row 11, Column 9\n     - Row 11, Column 15\n     - Row 12, Column 7\n     - Row 13, Column 3\n     - Row 13, Column 10\n     - Row 13, Column 17\n     - Row 14, Column 5\n     - Row 14, Column 19\n     - Row 16, Column 11\n     - Row 17, Column 6\n     - Row 17, Column 13\n     - Row 17, Column 20\n     - Row 18, Column 9\n     - Row 19, Column 7\n     - Row 19, Column 13\n     - Row 20, Column 3\n     - Row 20, Column 17\n\n2. **Look for a pattern:**\n   - Observing the positions, it seems that the \"✅\" symbols are placed in a pattern that repeats every few rows.\n   - The pattern appears to be a sequence of columns that repeats every 8 rows:\n     - Row 1: No \"✅\"\n     - Row 2: Column 11\n     - Row 3: Columns 6, 13, 20\n     - Row 4: Column 9\n     - Row 5: Columns 7, 13\n     - Row 6: Columns 3, 17\n     - Row 7: Columns 5, 11, 19\n     - Row 8: No \"✅\"\n     - This pattern repeats starting from Row 9.\n\n3. **Apply the pattern to the entire grid:**\n   - The pattern repeats every 8 rows, so we can fill in the grid by applying this pattern to each set of 8 rows.\n\n4. **Fill in the missing \"✅\" at the position of the question mark:**\n   - The question mark is located at Row 17, Column 8.\n   - According to the pattern, Row 17 should have \"✅\" at Columns 6, 13, and 20. Therefore, the question mark should be replaced with \"❌\".\n\n5. **Complete the grid:**\n   - Using the identified pattern, fill in the entire grid.\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n```\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n```\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌"
