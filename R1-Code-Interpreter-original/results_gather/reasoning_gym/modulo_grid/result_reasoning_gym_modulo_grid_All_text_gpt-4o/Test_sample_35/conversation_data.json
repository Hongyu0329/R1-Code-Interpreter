    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid where the \"✅\" symbols are placed. Let's analyze the given grid step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 20x20, with rows and columns indexed from 0 to 19.\n\n2. **Identifying the Pattern**: We need to find a mathematical pattern or rule that determines the placement of the \"✅\" symbols.\n\n3. **Observing the Positions of \"✅\"**:\n   - Row 1, Column 14\n   - Row 2, Column 7\n   - Row 4, Column 11\n   - Row 7, Column 2 and Column 17\n   - Row 8, Column 13\n   - Row 11, Column 4 and Column 19\n   - Row 13, Column 8\n   - Row 14, Column 1 and Column 16\n   - Row 16, Column 14\n   - Row 17, Column 7\n   - Row 19, Column 11\n\n4. **Analyzing the Pattern**:\n   - The pattern seems to involve a diagonal or a specific arithmetic sequence.\n   - Notice that the columns where \"✅\" appears seem to follow a pattern based on the row number.\n\n5. **Pattern Hypothesis**:\n   - The column index for each \"✅\" in a row seems to be related to a mathematical function of the row index.\n   - Observing the pattern, it appears that the column index is determined by a modulo operation or a linear transformation of the row index.\n\n6. **Testing the Hypothesis**:\n   - For Row 1, Column 14: \\(14 = (1 \\times 7) \\mod 20\\)\n   - For Row 2, Column 7: \\(7 = (2 \\times 7) \\mod 20\\)\n   - For Row 4, Column 11: \\(11 = (4 \\times 7) \\mod 20\\)\n   - For Row 7, Column 2: \\(2 = (7 \\times 7) \\mod 20\\)\n   - For Row 7, Column 17: \\(17 = (7 \\times 7 + 10) \\mod 20\\)\n   - For Row 8, Column 13: \\(13 = (8 \\times 7) \\mod 20\\)\n   - For Row 11, Column 4: \\(4 = (11 \\times 7) \\mod 20\\)\n   - For Row 11, Column 19: \\(19 = (11 \\times 7 + 10) \\mod 20\\)\n   - For Row 13, Column 8: \\(8 = (13 \\times 7) \\mod 20\\)\n   - For Row 14, Column 1: \\(1 = (14 \\times 7) \\mod 20\\)\n   - For Row 14, Column 16: \\(16 = (14 \\times 7 + 10) \\mod 20\\)\n   - For Row 16, Column 14: \\(14 = (16 \\times 7) \\mod 20\\)\n   - For Row 17, Column 7: \\(7 = (17 \\times 7) \\mod 20\\)\n   - For Row 19, Column 11: \\(11 = (19 \\times 7) \\mod 20\\)\n\n7. **Filling the Missing \"?\"**:\n   - For Row 19, the pattern suggests the next \"✅\" should be at Column 1, as \\(1 = (19 \\times 7 + 10) \\mod 20\\).\n\n8. **Conclusion**:\n   - The pattern involves placing \"✅\" at positions determined by the formula \\((\\text{row index} \\times 7) \\mod 20\\) and \\((\\text{row index} \\times 7 + 10) \\mod 20\\).\n\n9. **Final Answer**:\n   - Fill in the missing \"?\" with \"✅\" at Row 19, Column 1.\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n```\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n```\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌"
