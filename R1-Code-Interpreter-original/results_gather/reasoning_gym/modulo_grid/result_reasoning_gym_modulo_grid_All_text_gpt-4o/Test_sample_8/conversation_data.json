    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing value represented by the question mark (❔).\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   - The grid is a 20x20 matrix filled with two symbols: ✅ and ❌.\n   - Observing the grid, it appears that the ✅ symbols form diagonal lines.\n   - The first row has a ✅ at the 2nd position, the second row at the 3rd position, the third row at the 4th position, and so on.\n   - This suggests a pattern where the position of the ✅ in each row increases by one column as we move down each row.\n\n2. **Determine the Position of the Question Mark:**\n   - The question mark is located in the second row, seventh column.\n   - According to the pattern, the second row should have a ✅ in the third column.\n   - Therefore, the question mark should be replaced with a ❌ because the pattern does not place a ✅ in the seventh column of the second row.\n\n3. **Verify the Pattern:**\n   - Check a few more rows to ensure the pattern holds:\n     - Row 3: ✅ at column 4\n     - Row 4: ✅ at column 5\n     - Row 5: ✅ at column 6\n   - The pattern is consistent throughout the grid.\n\n4. **Fill in the Grid:**\n   - Replace the question mark with a ❌ based on the identified pattern.\n\nThe completed grid is as follows:\n\n```\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n```\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n>>>"
