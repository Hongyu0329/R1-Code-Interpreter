    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing values. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Structure**: The grid is a 20x20 matrix with '❌' and '✅' symbols. The '✅' symbols appear to follow a diagonal pattern.\n\n2. **Pattern Observation**:\n   - The '✅' symbols appear to form a diagonal line from the top right to the bottom left.\n   - The first '✅' is at position (0, 7), the second at (1, 6), the third at (2, 5), and so on.\n   - This suggests a pattern where the row index plus the column index equals a constant value.\n\n3. **Pattern Formula**:\n   - For the first '✅' at (0, 7), the sum of the indices is 0 + 7 = 7.\n   - For the second '✅' at (1, 6), the sum is 1 + 6 = 7.\n   - This pattern continues, indicating that the sum of the row and column indices for '✅' is always 7.\n\n4. **Filling the Grid**:\n   - We need to fill in the grid such that the sum of the row and column indices equals 7 for each '✅'.\n   - The missing '❔' is at position (17, 3). The sum of these indices is 17 + 3 = 20, which does not fit the pattern of 7.\n   - Therefore, the '❔' should be replaced with '❌' because it does not fit the pattern of '✅'.\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - Check the entire grid to ensure that all '✅' symbols follow the pattern where the sum of the row and column indices equals 7.\n   - The pattern holds true for all existing '✅' symbols.\n\n6. **Final Grid**:\n   - Replace the '❔' with '❌' as it does not fit the pattern.\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n```\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n```\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌"
