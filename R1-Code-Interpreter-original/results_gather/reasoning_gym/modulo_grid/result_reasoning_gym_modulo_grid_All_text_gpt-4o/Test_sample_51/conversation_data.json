    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing value represented by the question mark (❔).\n\n1. **Observation of the Grid:**\n   - The grid is a 20x20 matrix.\n   - The grid contains mostly ❌ symbols, with a few ✅ symbols.\n   - The ✅ symbols appear to form a diagonal line from the top right to the bottom left.\n\n2. **Pattern Recognition:**\n   - The position of the ✅ symbols seems to follow a pattern where they are placed diagonally.\n   - The first ✅ is at position (0, 14), the second at (1, 13), the third at (2, 12), and so on.\n   - This suggests that the row index plus the column index of each ✅ is constant.\n\n3. **Mathematical Pattern:**\n   - For the first row with a ✅, the indices are (0, 14), which sum to 14.\n   - For the second row with a ✅, the indices are (1, 13), which also sum to 14.\n   - This pattern continues, indicating that the sum of the row and column indices for each ✅ is 14.\n\n4. **Identifying the Missing Value:**\n   - The question mark (❔) is located at position (4, 11).\n   - The sum of these indices is 4 + 11 = 15.\n   - According to the pattern, the sum should be 14 for a ✅ to be placed there.\n   - Therefore, the position (4, 11) should actually contain a ❌, not a ✅.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The grid follows a diagonal pattern where the sum of the row and column indices for each ✅ is 14.\n   - The question mark should be replaced with a ❌ to maintain this pattern.\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n```\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n```\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n"
