    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing value represented by the question mark. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Layout**: The grid is a 20x20 matrix filled with '❌' and '✅' symbols, with one '❔' symbol representing the unknown value we need to determine.\n\n2. **Identifying the Pattern**: \n   - The '✅' symbols appear to follow a specific pattern. By examining their positions, we can try to deduce the rule governing their placement.\n   - Let's list the coordinates of the '✅' symbols:\n     - (1, 7)\n     - (2, 12)\n     - (3, 8)\n     - (4, 3)\n     - (5, 6)\n     - (6, 15)\n     - (7, 4)\n     - (8, 1)\n     - (8, 18)\n     - (9, 9)\n     - (10, 14)\n     - (11, 17)\n     - (12, 13)\n     - (13, 2)\n     - (13, 19)\n     - (14, 11)\n     - (15, 5)\n     - (16, 10)\n     - (17, 16)\n     - (19, 7)\n     - (20, 12)\n\n3. **Analyzing the Pattern**:\n   - The '✅' symbols seem to be placed in a pattern that involves both rows and columns.\n   - Observing the sequence of column numbers for each row, we notice that they do not follow a simple arithmetic or geometric sequence.\n   - However, the pattern might be related to a specific mathematical function or a permutation of numbers.\n\n4. **Filling the Missing Value**:\n   - The '❔' is located at position (3, 11).\n   - We need to determine if this position should be a '✅' or a '❌'.\n   - By examining the pattern, we notice that the '✅' symbols are distributed in a way that each row has a unique column number for '✅'.\n   - Since row 3 already has a '✅' at column 8, the position (3, 11) should be a '❌'.\n\n5. **Finalizing the Grid**:\n   - With the above analysis, we can conclude that the '❔' should be replaced with a '❌'.\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n```\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n```\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌"
