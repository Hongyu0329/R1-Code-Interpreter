    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing values. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 20 rows by 20 columns.\n\n2. **Pattern Recognition**:\n   - The grid contains '✅' and '❌' symbols.\n   - Each row has exactly one '✅'.\n   - The position of '✅' in each row seems to follow a specific pattern.\n\n3. **Observing the Pattern**:\n   - In the first row, '✅' is at the 8th position.\n   - In the second row, '✅' is at the 9th position.\n   - In the third row, '✅' is at the 10th position.\n   - This pattern continues, with the '✅' moving one position to the right in each subsequent row.\n\n4. **Pattern Continuation**:\n   - The pattern continues until the 14th row, where '✅' is at the 14th position.\n   - In the 15th row, the '✅' is at the 12th position, indicating a reset or wrap-around in the pattern.\n   - From the 15th row onward, the '✅' continues to move one position to the right in each subsequent row.\n\n5. **Filling in the Missing Values**:\n   - In the 15th row, the '✅' is at the 12th position.\n   - In the 16th row, the '✅' is at the 13th position.\n   - In the 17th row, the '✅' is at the 14th position.\n   - In the 18th row, the '✅' is at the 15th position.\n   - In the 19th row, the '✅' is at the 11th position.\n   - In the 20th row, the '✅' is at the 12th position.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The pattern is a diagonal movement of '✅' from left to right, with a reset or wrap-around after reaching the end of the grid.\n\nNow, let's fill in the missing '❔' with the correct '✅' position based on the identified pattern:\n\n- In the 15th row, the '✅' should be at the 12th position.\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n\n```\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n```\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌"
