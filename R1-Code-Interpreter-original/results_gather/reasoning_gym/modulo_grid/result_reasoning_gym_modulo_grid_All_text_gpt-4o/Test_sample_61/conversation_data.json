    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing value represented by the question mark (❔).\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**:\n   - The grid is 20 rows by 20 columns.\n   - The grid contains two symbols: ❌ and ✅.\n   - The ✅ symbols appear in a regular pattern.\n\n2. **Pattern Identification**:\n   - Look at the rows where ✅ appears:\n     - Row 2: ✅ appears at columns 4, 8, 12, 16, 20.\n     - Row 4: ✅ appears at columns 2, 6, 10, 14, 18.\n     - Row 6: Same as Row 2.\n     - Row 8: Same as Row 4.\n     - This pattern repeats every 4 rows.\n\n3. **Pattern Explanation**:\n   - The pattern alternates every two rows:\n     - In rows 2, 6, 10, 14, 18: ✅ appears at columns 4, 8, 12, 16, 20.\n     - In rows 4, 8, 12, 16, 20: ✅ appears at columns 2, 6, 10, 14, 18.\n\n4. **Locate the Question Mark**:\n   - The question mark (❔) is located at row 5, column 6.\n\n5. **Determine the Correct Symbol for the Question Mark**:\n   - Row 5 is between rows 4 and 6.\n   - Row 5 follows the pattern of rows 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, which are entirely filled with ❌.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The question mark (❔) should be replaced with ❌.\n\n7. **Final Grid**:\n   - Replace the question mark with ❌ and present the completed grid.\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n```\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌\n```\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌\n>>>"
