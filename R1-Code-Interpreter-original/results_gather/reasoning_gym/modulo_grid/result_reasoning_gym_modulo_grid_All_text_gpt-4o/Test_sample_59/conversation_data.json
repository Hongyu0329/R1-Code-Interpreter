    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing value represented by the question mark.\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**: The grid is a 20x20 matrix filled with '❌' and '✅'. The '✅' marks seem to follow a diagonal pattern.\n\n2. **Pattern Identification**:\n   - The '✅' marks appear to be placed diagonally from the top left to the bottom right.\n   - Observing the positions of '✅', they are located at:\n     - Row 1, Column 9\n     - Row 2, Column 10\n     - Row 3, Column 11\n     - Row 4, Column 12\n     - Row 5, Column 13\n     - Row 6, Column 14\n     - Row 7, Column 15\n     - Row 8, Column 16\n     - Row 9, Column 1 and Column 17\n     - Row 10, Column 2 and Column 18\n     - Row 11, Column 3 and Column 19\n     - Row 12, Column 4 and Column 20\n     - Row 13, Column 5\n     - Row 14, Column 6\n     - Row 15, Column 7\n     - Row 16, Column 8\n     - Row 17, Column 9\n     - Row 18, Column 10\n     - Row 19, Column 11\n     - Row 20, Column 12\n\n3. **Pattern Description**:\n   - The '✅' marks form two diagonal lines:\n     - The first diagonal starts at Row 1, Column 9 and continues to Row 8, Column 16.\n     - The second diagonal starts at Row 9, Column 1 and continues to Row 12, Column 20.\n     - After Row 12, the pattern continues with a single diagonal from Row 13, Column 5 to Row 20, Column 12.\n\n4. **Filling the Missing Value**:\n   - The missing value is at Row 20, Column 12.\n   - According to the pattern, Row 20, Column 12 should be '✅'.\n\n5. **Final Grid**:\n   - The grid is completed by placing '✅' at Row 20, Column 12.\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n```\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n```\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌"
