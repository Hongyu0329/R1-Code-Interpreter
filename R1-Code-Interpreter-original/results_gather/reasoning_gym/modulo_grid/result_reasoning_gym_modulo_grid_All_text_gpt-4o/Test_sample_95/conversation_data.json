    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing value represented by the question mark. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**:\n   - The grid is 20x20 in size.\n   - The grid contains two symbols: ✅ and ❌.\n   - The ✅ symbols appear to follow a specific pattern.\n\n2. **Pattern Identification**:\n   - Observing the positions of the ✅ symbols, we notice they appear in a diagonal pattern.\n   - The positions of the ✅ symbols in the grid are as follows:\n     - Row 2, Column 5\n     - Row 3, Column 3\n     - Row 4, Column 17\n     - Row 5, Column 5\n     - Row 6, Column 17\n     - Row 8, Column 5\n     - Row 9, Column 3\n     - Row 9, Column 17\n     - Row 11, Column 5\n     - Row 12, Column 17\n     - Row 14, Column 5\n     - Row 15, Column 3\n     - Row 15, Column 17\n     - Row 17, Column 5\n     - Row 18, Column 17\n     - Row 20, Column 5\n\n3. **Pattern Recognition**:\n   - The pattern seems to repeat every 6 rows, with the ✅ appearing in columns 5, 3, and 17.\n   - Specifically, the pattern is:\n     - Row 1: Column 5\n     - Row 2: Column 3\n     - Row 3: Column 17\n     - Row 4: Column 5\n     - Row 5: Column 17\n     - Row 6: Column 5\n\n4. **Filling the Missing Value**:\n   - The question mark is located at Row 4, Column 3.\n   - According to the pattern, Row 4 should have a ✅ in Column 5, not Column 3.\n   - Therefore, the question mark should be replaced with ❌.\n\n5. **Final Grid**:\n   - Replace the question mark with ❌ and ensure the rest of the grid follows the identified pattern.\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n```\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n```\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌"
