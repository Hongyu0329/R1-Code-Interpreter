    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and apply it to fill in the missing part. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**: The grid is a 20x20 matrix filled with ❌ symbols, except for one ✅ symbol and one ❔ symbol. The ✅ symbol is located at the 2nd row and 4th column, and the ❔ symbol is located at the 17th row and 11th column.\n\n2. **Pattern Identification**: The task is to identify a pattern that explains the placement of the ✅ symbol and use it to determine what should replace the ❔ symbol.\n\n3. **Pattern Hypothesis**: Given the sparse information, one possible pattern is that the ✅ symbol marks a specific position in the grid, and the same pattern should be applied to the ❔ symbol's position.\n\n4. **Position Analysis**: The position of the ✅ symbol is (2, 4). The position of the ❔ symbol is (17, 11). We need to determine if there's a consistent rule or pattern that can be applied to both positions.\n\n5. **Pattern Application**: Since the grid is mostly filled with ❌ symbols, and only one ✅ symbol is present, it suggests that the pattern might be simple or based on a specific rule. A straightforward assumption is that the ❔ symbol should be replaced with a ✅ symbol, following the same pattern of marking a specific position.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the most logical completion of the grid is to replace the ❔ symbol with a ✅ symbol, as it follows the pattern of marking a specific position in the grid.\n\nTherefore, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n>>>"
