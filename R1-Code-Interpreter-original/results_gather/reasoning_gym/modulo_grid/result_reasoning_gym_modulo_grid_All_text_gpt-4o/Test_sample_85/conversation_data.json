    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing value represented by the question mark.\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**: The grid is a 20x20 matrix with '❌' and '✅' symbols. The '✅' symbols appear to follow a diagonal pattern.\n\n2. **Pattern Identification**:\n   - The first row has a '✅' at the 7th position.\n   - The second row has a '✅' at the 8th position.\n   - The third row has a '✅' at the 9th position.\n   - This pattern continues, with each subsequent row having a '✅' one position to the right of the previous row's '✅'.\n   - After reaching the end of a row, the pattern seems to wrap around to the beginning of the next row.\n\n3. **Pattern Continuation**:\n   - The 6th row has a '✅' at the 12th position.\n   - The 7th row has a '✅' at the 1st position, indicating the wrap-around.\n   - The 8th row has a '✅' at the 2nd position.\n   - This pattern continues, with the '✅' moving one position to the right in each subsequent row.\n\n4. **Filling the Missing Value**:\n   - The 7th row has a '✅' at the 1st position.\n   - The 8th row has a '✅' at the 2nd position.\n   - The 9th row has a '✅' at the 3rd position.\n   - The 10th row has a '✅' at the 4th position.\n   - The 11th row has a '✅' at the 5th position.\n   - The 12th row has a '✅' at the 6th position.\n   - The 13th row has a '✅' at the 7th position.\n   - The 14th row has a '✅' at the 8th position.\n   - The 15th row has a '✅' at the 9th position.\n   - The 16th row has a '✅' at the 10th position.\n   - The 17th row has a '✅' at the 11th position.\n   - The 18th row has a '✅' at the 12th position.\n   - The 19th row has a '✅' at the 13th position.\n   - The 20th row has a '✅' at the 14th position.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The missing value in the 7th row is at the 13th position, which should be a '✅'.\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n\n```\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n```\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n"
