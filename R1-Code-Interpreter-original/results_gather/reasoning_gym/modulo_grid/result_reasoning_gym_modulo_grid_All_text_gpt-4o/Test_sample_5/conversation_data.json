    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the question marks. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**:\n   - The grid is a 20x20 matrix.\n   - The grid contains '✅' and '❌' symbols, with a few question marks ('❔') that need to be filled.\n   - The '✅' symbols appear to form a diagonal pattern from the top left to the bottom right.\n\n2. **Pattern Identification**:\n   - Observing the positions of the '✅' symbols:\n     - Row 1, Column 4\n     - Row 2, Column 3\n     - Row 3, Column 2\n     - Row 4, Column 1\n     - Row 5, Column 20\n     - Row 6, Column 19\n     - Row 7, Column 18\n     - Row 8, Column 17\n     - Row 9, Column 16\n     - Row 10, Column 15\n     - Row 11, Column 14\n     - Row 12, Column 13\n     - Row 13, Column 12\n     - Row 14, Column 11\n     - Row 15, Column 10\n     - Row 16, Column 9\n     - Row 17, Column 8\n     - Row 18, Column 7\n     - Row 19, Column 6\n     - Row 20, Column 5\n\n3. **Pattern Description**:\n   - The '✅' symbols form a diagonal pattern that starts from the top left and moves to the bottom right, wrapping around the grid.\n   - The pattern can be described as follows: for each row `i`, the '✅' is placed at column `(5 - i) % 20 + 1`, where `%` denotes the modulo operation.\n\n4. **Filling the Grid**:\n   - Using the identified pattern, we can fill in the question marks ('❔') with '✅' symbols.\n   - The question mark in Row 12, Column 14 should be replaced with '✅' based on the pattern.\n\n5. **Final Grid**:\n   - Replace the question mark with '✅' according to the pattern.\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n```\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n```\n\nThus, the final completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌"
