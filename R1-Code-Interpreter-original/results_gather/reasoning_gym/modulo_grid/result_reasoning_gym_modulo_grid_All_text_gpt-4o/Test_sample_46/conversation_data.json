    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing values. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 20 rows by 20 columns.\n\n2. **Pattern Recognition**: \n   - We notice that the grid has a repeating pattern of '✅' and '❌'.\n   - The '✅' symbols appear to be placed diagonally across the grid.\n   - Observing the positions of '✅', we see that they are placed in a pattern that repeats every 6 rows and 6 columns.\n\n3. **Pattern Details**:\n   - In the first 6 rows, the '✅' appear at the following column positions:\n     - Row 2: Column 5, Column 12, Column 19\n     - Row 3: Column 3, Column 10, Column 17\n     - Row 4: Column 7, Column 14\n     - Row 5: Column 2, Column 9, Column 16\n     - Row 6: Column 6, Column 13, Column 20\n     - Row 7: Column 4, Column 11, Column 18\n   - This pattern repeats every 6 rows.\n\n4. **Filling the Grid**:\n   - We need to fill in the missing '❔' in the grid using the identified pattern.\n   - The '❔' is located at Row 9, Column 14.\n   - According to the pattern, Row 9 should have '✅' at Column 14.\n\n5. **Final Grid**:\n   - We replace the '❔' with '✅' at Row 9, Column 14.\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n```\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n```\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n>>>"
