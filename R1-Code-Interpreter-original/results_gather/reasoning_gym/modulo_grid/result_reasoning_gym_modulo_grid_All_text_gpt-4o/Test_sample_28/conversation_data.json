    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the question marks. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Structure**: The grid is 20 rows by 20 columns, filled with either \"❌\" or \"✅\". The \"✅\" marks appear to follow a specific pattern.\n\n2. **Pattern Observation**:\n   - The \"✅\" marks appear in specific columns across different rows.\n   - Observing the rows with \"✅\", we see that they appear in columns 8 and 17 consistently across multiple rows.\n   - Additionally, in rows 3, 9, and 15, the \"✅\" marks appear in columns 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, and 17.\n\n3. **Pattern Analysis**:\n   - The columns with \"✅\" marks are consistent across certain rows, suggesting a repeating pattern.\n   - The rows with \"✅\" marks in columns 8 and 17 are: 2, 6, 8, 12, 14, 18, and 20.\n   - The rows with \"✅\" marks in columns 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, and 17 are: 4, 10, and 16.\n\n4. **Filling the Grid**:\n   - The question mark is located at row 15, column 10.\n   - Based on the pattern, row 15 should have \"✅\" marks in columns 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, and 17.\n   - Therefore, the question mark at row 15, column 10 should be \"❌\" because column 10 is not part of the pattern for row 15.\n\n5. **Final Grid**:\n   - We fill in the grid with the identified pattern, ensuring that the question mark is replaced with \"❌\".\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n```\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n```\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n>>>"
