    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing value. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid is 20 rows by 20 columns.\n\n2. **Pattern Observation**:\n   - The grid contains a diagonal pattern of \"✅\" symbols.\n   - The first \"✅\" appears at position (0, 2).\n   - The second \"✅\" appears at position (1, 1).\n   - The third \"✅\" appears at position (2, 0).\n   - The fourth \"✅\" appears at position (3, 11).\n   - The fifth \"✅\" appears at position (4, 10).\n   - The sixth \"✅\" appears at position (5, 9).\n   - The seventh \"✅\" appears at position (6, 8).\n   - The eighth \"✅\" appears at position (7, 7).\n   - The ninth \"✅\" appears at position (8, 6).\n   - The tenth \"✅\" appears at position (9, 5).\n   - The eleventh \"✅\" appears at position (10, 4).\n   - The twelfth \"✅\" appears at position (11, 3).\n   - The thirteenth \"✅\" appears at position (12, 2).\n   - The fourteenth \"✅\" appears at position (13, 1).\n   - The fifteenth \"✅\" appears at position (14, 0).\n   - The sixteenth \"✅\" appears at position (15, 11).\n   - The seventeenth \"✅\" appears at position (16, 10).\n   - The eighteenth \"✅\" appears at position (17, 9).\n   - The nineteenth \"✅\" appears at position (18, 8).\n   - The twentieth \"✅\" appears at position (19, 7).\n\n3. **Pattern Analysis**:\n   - The \"✅\" symbols form two diagonal lines.\n   - The first diagonal line starts at (0, 2) and moves downwards to the left, wrapping around the grid.\n   - The second diagonal line starts at (3, 11) and moves downwards to the left, wrapping around the grid.\n\n4. **Filling the Missing Value**:\n   - The missing value is at position (9, 2).\n   - Based on the pattern, the missing value should be \"✅\" because it follows the diagonal pattern from (12, 2) to (9, 2).\n\n5. **Completed Grid**:\n   - We fill in the missing \"✅\" at position (9, 2).\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n```\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌"
