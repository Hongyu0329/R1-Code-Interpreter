    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid where the \"✅\" symbols are placed. Let's analyze the given grid step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Dimensions**: The grid appears to be 20 rows by 20 columns.\n\n2. **Identifying the Pattern**: \n   - The positions of the \"✅\" symbols in the grid are as follows:\n     - Row 2, Column 15\n     - Row 3, Column 8\n     - Row 4, Column 17\n     - Row 5, Column 13\n     - Row 6, Column 14\n     - Row 7, Column 9\n     - Row 8, Column 3 and Column 20\n     - Row 9, Column 7\n     - Row 10, Column 12\n     - Row 11, Column 16\n     - Row 12, Column 10\n     - Row 13, Column 5\n     - Row 14, Column 6\n     - Row 15, Column 2 and Column 19\n     - Row 16, Column 11\n     - Row 17, Column 4\n     - Row 19, Column 15\n     - Row 20, Column 8\n\n3. **Pattern Analysis**:\n   - The pattern seems to involve a sequence of numbers that are not immediately obvious. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the columns where \"✅\" appears are related to a sequence of numbers that are either prime numbers or follow a specific arithmetic pattern.\n   - Observing the sequence of column numbers: 15, 8, 17, 13, 14, 9, 3, 20, 7, 12, 16, 10, 5, 6, 2, 19, 11, 4, 15, 8, we notice that these numbers are not in a simple arithmetic or geometric sequence, but they do seem to follow a pattern of alternating between two sequences or a mirrored pattern.\n\n4. **Filling the Missing Value**:\n   - The missing value is in Row 15, Column 15. Based on the pattern observed, the column numbers seem to repeat or mirror after a certain point. Since Row 15 already has a \"✅\" in Column 2, and the pattern seems to involve mirroring or repeating, the missing \"✅\" should be placed in Column 15.\n\n5. **Final Grid**:\n   - With the missing value filled in, the completed grid is as follows:\n\n```\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n```\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌"
