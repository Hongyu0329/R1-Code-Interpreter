    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing value represented by the question mark.\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**: The grid is a 20x20 matrix with '❌' and '✅' symbols. The '✅' symbols appear to follow a diagonal pattern.\n\n2. **Pattern Identification**:\n   - The '✅' symbols are placed in a diagonal line from the top right to the bottom left.\n   - The position of '✅' in each row seems to be moving one column to the left as we move down each row.\n\n3. **Pattern Formula**:\n   - For a given row `i` (starting from 0), the '✅' appears at column `j = 19 - i`.\n   - This means in the first row (i=0), the '✅' is at column 19, in the second row (i=1), it's at column 18, and so on.\n\n4. **Filling the Grid**:\n   - We need to fill the grid according to the identified pattern.\n   - The question mark is located at row 9, column 10. According to our pattern, for row 9, the '✅' should be at column `19 - 9 = 10`.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The question mark should be replaced with '✅' as it fits the pattern.\n\nNow, let's present the completed grid:\n\n```\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n```\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n>>>"
