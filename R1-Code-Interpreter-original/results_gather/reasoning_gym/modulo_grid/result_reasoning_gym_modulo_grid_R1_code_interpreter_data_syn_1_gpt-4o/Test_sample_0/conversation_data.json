    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and fill in the question marks accordingly. Let's analyze the grid:\n\n1. The grid is 20x20, and it contains two symbols: ❌ and ✅.\n2. The ✅ symbols appear in a regular pattern, suggesting a mathematical rule or sequence.\n\nLet's examine the positions of the ✅ symbols:\n\n- Row 2, Column 9\n- Row 2, Column 19\n- Row 4, Column 3\n- Row 4, Column 13\n- Row 6, Column 9\n- Row 6, Column 19\n- Row 8, Column 3\n- Row 8, Column 13\n- Row 10, Column 9\n- Row 10, Column 19\n- Row 12, Column 3\n- Row 12, Column 13\n- Row 14, Column 9\n- Row 14, Column 19\n- Row 16, Column 3\n- Row 16, Column 13\n- Row 18, Column 9\n- Row 18, Column 19\n- Row 20, Column 3\n- Row 20, Column 13\n\nObserving the pattern, it seems that the ✅ symbols appear in every second row, and within those rows, they appear in a repeating pattern of columns: 3, 9, 13, and 19.\n\nTo fill in the question marks, we need to apply this pattern to the entire grid. Let's write a Python script to generate the completed grid:\n\n```python\n# Initialize a 20x20 grid with ❌\ngrid = [['❌' for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(20)]\n\n# Define the pattern for the columns where ✅ appears\npattern_columns = [2, 8, 12, 18]  # 0-indexed\n\n# Fill in the grid according to the pattern\nfor row in range(1, 20, 2):  # 1-indexed rows: 2, 4, 6, ..., 20\n    for col in pattern_columns:\n        grid[row][col] = '✅'\n\n# Print the completed grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(''.join(row))\n```\n\nThis code will generate the completed grid by filling in the ✅ symbols according to the identified pattern. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and produced the completed grid. The pattern was correctly identified and applied to fill in the question marks. Here is the completed grid:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n>>>"
