    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and fill in the missing values. Let's analyze the grid:\n\n1. The grid is 20 rows by 20 columns.\n2. The pattern involves placing a ✅ in certain positions.\n3. Observing the grid, we see that the ✅ appears in the same columns for every row that has them: columns 2, 8, and 14.\n4. The rows with ✅ are every third row starting from the second row (i.e., rows 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20).\n\nGiven this pattern, the missing value in the grid (represented by ❔) should be a ❌ because it is not in one of the columns where a ✅ appears.\n\nLet's fill in the grid based on this pattern and return the completed grid.\n\n```python\n# Define the grid size\nrows, cols = 20, 20\n\n# Initialize the grid with ❌\ngrid = [['❌' for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]\n\n# Fill in the pattern with ✅\nfor row in range(1, rows, 2):\n    for col in [2, 8, 14]:\n        grid[row][col] = '✅'\n\n# Convert the grid to a string representation\ncompleted_grid = '\\n'.join([''.join(row) for row in grid])\n\n# Print the completed grid\nprint(completed_grid)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the completed grid.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matches the expected pattern. The grid is filled according to the identified pattern, with ✅ appearing in columns 2, 8, and 14 for every second row starting from the second row.
