    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the question marks. Let's analyze the grid:\n\n1. The grid is 20x20, and we have a diagonal line of check marks (✅) starting from the bottom left corner to the top right corner.\n2. The pattern seems to be a diagonal line that moves one step up and one step to the right for each row.\n3. The question mark is located at row 7, column 14. Based on the pattern, the check mark should be at this position.\n\nLet's fill in the grid using this pattern and verify the position of the question mark.\n\n```python\n# Initialize a 20x20 grid with '❌'\ngrid = [['❌' for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(20)]\n\n# Fill the grid with the pattern\nfor i in range(20):\n    grid[i][19 - i] = '✅'\n\n# Replace the question mark with the correct pattern\ngrid[7][14] = '✅'\n\n# Print the completed grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(''.join(row))\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will print the completed grid. Let's see the output.",
