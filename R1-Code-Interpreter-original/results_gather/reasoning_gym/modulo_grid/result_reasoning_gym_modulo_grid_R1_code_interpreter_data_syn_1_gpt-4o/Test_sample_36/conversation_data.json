    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and fill in the question mark. The grid is a 20x20 matrix with a question mark at position (14, 15) and a check mark at position (20, 1).\n\nLet's analyze the grid:\n\n1. The grid is filled with '❌' except for two special symbols: '✅' at the bottom-left corner (20, 1) and '❔' at position (14, 15).\n2. The task is to identify the pattern and fill in the question mark.\n\nGiven the position of the '✅' and the '❔', it seems like the pattern might involve a diagonal or some other geometric shape. However, without additional context or numbers, it's challenging to deduce a mathematical pattern directly.\n\nLet's consider a simple approach: if the '✅' at (20, 1) is the start of a pattern, it might be a diagonal line or some other shape that passes through (14, 15). \n\nTo explore this, let's assume a diagonal line pattern from (20, 1) to (1, 20) and see if it passes through (14, 15). If it does, we can fill the question mark with '✅'.\n\nLet's write a Python script to check if a diagonal line from (20, 1) to (1, 20) passes through (14, 15).\n\n```python\ndef is_on_diagonal(x, y):\n    # Check if the point (x, y) is on the diagonal from (20, 1) to (1, 20)\n    return x + y == 21\n\n# Check if (14, 15) is on the diagonal\nresult = is_on_diagonal(14, 15)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to see if (14, 15) is on the diagonal.",
    "The output indicates that the point (14, 15) is not on the diagonal line from (20, 1) to (1, 20) based on the condition \\(x + y = 21\\). This suggests that the pattern might not be a simple diagonal line.\n\nLet's reconsider the problem. The grid is mostly filled with '❌', and there are two special symbols: '✅' at (20, 1) and '❔' at (14, 15). Since the initial assumption of a diagonal line didn't work, we need to explore other possibilities.\n\nOne possibility is that the '✅' at (20, 1) is the only special symbol, and the '❔' at (14, 15) should be filled with '❌', maintaining the pattern of mostly '❌' with a single '✅'.\n\nGiven the lack of additional information or a clear pattern, the simplest solution is to fill the question mark with '❌', assuming that the '✅' is a unique marker.\n\nLet's fill the grid with this assumption:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n>>>"
