    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing values. Let's analyze the grid:\n\n1. The grid is 20x20, and it contains two symbols: ❌ and ✅.\n2. The pattern of ✅ appears to be consistent in certain rows and columns.\n\nLet's break down the pattern:\n\n- In rows 1, 5, 9, 13, and 17, the pattern is ❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌.\n- In rows 3, 7, 11, 15, and 19, the pattern is the same as above.\n- In rows 2, 6, 10, 14, and 18, the pattern is ❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅.\n\nThe question mark is in row 2, column 2.
