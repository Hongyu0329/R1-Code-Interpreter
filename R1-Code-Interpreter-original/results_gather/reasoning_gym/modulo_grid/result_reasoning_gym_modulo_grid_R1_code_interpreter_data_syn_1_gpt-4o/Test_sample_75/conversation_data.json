    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and fill in the missing question mark. The grid is a 20x20 matrix with a diagonal pattern of check marks (✅) and crosses (❌). \n\nLet's analyze the pattern:\n\n1. The first row has a check mark at the 11th position.\n2. The second row has a check mark at the 12th position.\n3. The third row has a check mark at the 13th position.\n4. This pattern continues, with each subsequent row having a check mark one position to the right of the previous row's check mark.\n\nThe pattern is a diagonal line of check marks that starts at the 11th column of the first row and moves one column to the right for each subsequent row. \n\nNow, let's determine the position of the check mark in the 14th row, which currently has a question mark:\n\n- The 14th row should have a check mark at the 17th position, following the pattern.\n\nLet's fill in the grid with this information and return the completed grid.\n\n```python\n# Initialize the grid with crosses\ngrid = [['❌' for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(20)]\n\n# Fill in the check marks according to the identified pattern\nfor i in range(20):\n    grid[i][(i + 10) % 20] = '✅'\n\n# Convert the grid to a string representation\ncompleted_grid = '\\n'.join([''.join(row) for row in grid])\n\nprint(completed_grid)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the completed grid.",
