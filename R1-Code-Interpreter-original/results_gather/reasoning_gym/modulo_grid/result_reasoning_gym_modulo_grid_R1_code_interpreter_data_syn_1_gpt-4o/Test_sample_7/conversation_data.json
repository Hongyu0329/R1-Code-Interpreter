    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid. The grid is a 20x20 matrix with '✅' and '❌' symbols. The '✅' symbols seem to form a diagonal pattern. Let's analyze the positions of the '✅' symbols:\n\n1. The first row has a '✅' at position (0, 0).\n2. The second row has a '✅' at position (1, 0).\n3. The third row has a '✅' at position (2, 11).\n4. The fourth row has a '✅' at position (3, 10).\n5. The fifth row has a '✅' at position (4, 9).\n6. The sixth row has a '✅' at position (5, 8).\n7. The seventh row has a '✅' at position (6, 7).\n8. The eighth row has a '✅' at position (7, 6).\n9. The ninth row has a '✅' at position (8, 5).\n10. The tenth row has a '✅' at position (9, 4).\n11. The eleventh row has a '✅' at position (10, 3).\n12. The twelfth row has a '✅' at position (11, 2).\n13. The thirteenth row has a '✅' at position (12, 1).\n14. The fourteenth row has a '✅' at position (13, 0).\n15. The fifteenth row has a '✅' at position (14, 11).\n16. The sixteenth row has a '✅' at position (15, 10).\n17. The seventeenth row has a '✅' at position (16, 9).\n18. The eighteenth row has a '✅' at position (17, 8).\n19. The nineteenth row has a '✅' at position (18, 7).\n20. The twentieth row has a '✅' at position (19, 6).\n\nThe pattern seems to be that the '✅' symbols are placed in a diagonal manner, with the column index decreasing by 1 as the row index increases by 1, until it reaches the bottom of the grid, then it starts again from the right side of the grid.\n\nLet's write a Python script to fill in the grid based on this pattern and replace the '?' with the correct symbol.\n\n```python\n# Initialize the grid with '❌'\ngrid = [['❌' for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(20)]\n\n# Fill the grid with '✅' based on the identified pattern\nfor i in range(20):\n    if i < 14:\n        grid[i][i] = '✅'\n    else:\n        grid[i][i - 13] = '✅'\n\n# Print the completed grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(''.join(row))\n```\n\nThis code will fill the grid according to the identified pattern and print the completed grid.",
    "The output from the code does not match the expected pattern in the grid. It seems that the pattern I initially identified was incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the pattern:\n\nUpon closer inspection, the '✅' symbols appear to form a diagonal pattern that shifts every 13 rows. The pattern is as follows:\n\n- The first 13 rows have a '✅' in the column that matches the row index.\n- Starting from the 14th row, the '✅' appears to shift to the right by 11 columns.\n\nLet's correct the code to reflect this pattern:\n\n```python\n# Initialize the grid with '❌'\ngrid = [['❌' for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(20)]\n\n# Fill the grid with '✅' based on the identified pattern\nfor i in range(20):\n    if i < 13:\n        grid[i][i] = '✅'\n    else:\n        grid[i][i - 13 + 11] = '✅'\n\n# Print the completed grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(''.join(row))\n```\n\nThis code should correctly fill the grid according to the observed pattern. Let's execute it to verify the output.",
    "The output still does not match the expected pattern. Let's re-evaluate the pattern more carefully.\n\nUpon further inspection, the pattern seems to be a diagonal that shifts every 13 rows, but the shift is not correctly implemented in the previous code. Let's correct the logic:\n\n1. The first 13 rows have a '✅' in the column that matches the row index.\n2. Starting from the 14th row, the '✅' appears to shift to the right by 7 columns.\n\nLet's correct the code to reflect this pattern:\n\n```python\n# Initialize the grid with '❌'\ngrid = [['❌' for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(20)]\n\n# Fill the grid with '✅' based on the identified pattern\nfor i in range(20):\n    if i < 13:\n        grid[i][12 - i] = '✅'\n    else:\n        grid[i][i - 7] = '✅'\n\n# Print the completed grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(''.join(row))\n```\n\nThis code should correctly fill the grid according to the observed pattern. Let's execute it to verify the output.",
    "The output now matches the expected pattern. The '✅' symbols form a diagonal that shifts every 13 rows, and the pattern is correctly implemented in the code. The grid is now complete and matches the pattern observed in the original grid.\n\nHere is the completed grid:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n>>>"
