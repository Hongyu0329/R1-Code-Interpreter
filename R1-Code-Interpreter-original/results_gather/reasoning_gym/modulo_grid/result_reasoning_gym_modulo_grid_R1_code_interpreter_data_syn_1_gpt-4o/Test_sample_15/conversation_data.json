    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and fill in the missing value represented by the question mark. Let's analyze the grid:\n\n1. The grid is 20x20 in size.\n2. There are two columns with a pattern of check marks (✅) at regular intervals.\n3. The check marks appear in the 4th and 16th columns.\n4. The check marks in these columns appear every 2 rows, starting from the 4th row.\n\nGiven this pattern, the question mark in the grid should be replaced with a check mark (✅) because it is in the 16th column and follows the same row pattern.\n\nNow, let's fill in the grid with this pattern and generate the completed grid.\n\n```python\n# Initialize a 20x20 grid with ❌\ngrid = [['❌' for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(20)]\n\n# Fill in the pattern with ✅\nfor row in range(3, 20, 2):  # Start from the 4th row (index 3) and step by 2\n    grid[row][3] = '✅'  # 4th column (index 3)\n    grid[row][15] = '✅'  # 16th column (index 15)\n\n# Print the completed grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(''.join(row))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the completed grid.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the grid was filled according to the identified pattern. The pattern involves placing a check mark (✅) in the 4th and 16th columns, starting from the 4th row and continuing every 2 rows.
