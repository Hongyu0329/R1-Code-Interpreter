    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and fill in the question marks accordingly. Let's analyze the grid:\n\n1. The grid is 20x20 in size.\n2. The pattern involves placing a ✅ symbol in specific positions.\n3. Observing the given grid, we notice that the ✅ symbols appear in a repeating pattern.\n\nLet's list the positions of the ✅ symbols in the grid:\n\n- Row 2: Column 3 and Column 18\n- Row 4: Column 9\n- Row 6: Column 3 and Column 18\n- Row 8: Column 9\n- Row 10: Column 3 and Column 18\n- Row 12: Column 8\n- Row 14: Column 3 and Column 18\n- Row 16: Column 9\n- Row 18: Column 3 and Column 18\n- Row 20: Column 9\n\nFrom this, we can see that the pattern repeats every 4 rows, with the ✅ symbols appearing in columns 3, 9, and 18. Specifically:\n\n- In rows 2, 6, 10, 14, and 18, the ✅ symbols are in columns 3 and 18.\n- In rows 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20, the ✅ symbol is in column 9.\n\nNow, let's fill in the grid based on this pattern and replace the ❔ with the correct symbol.\n\n```python\n# Define the grid size\nrows, cols = 20, 20\n\n# Initialize the grid with ❌\ngrid = [['❌' for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]\n\n# Fill in the grid based on the identified pattern\nfor r in range(rows):\n    if r % 4 == 1:  # Rows 2, 6, 10, 14, 18 (0-indexed: 1, 5, 9, 13, 17)\n        grid[r][2] = '✅'\n        grid[r][17] = '✅'\n    elif r % 4 == 3:  # Rows 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 (0-indexed: 3, 7, 11, 15, 19)\n        grid[r][8] = '✅'\n\n# Print the completed grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(''.join(row))\n```\n\nThe code will generate the completed grid based on the identified pattern. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output matches the expected pattern based on the analysis. The grid is filled according to the identified pattern, with the ✅ symbols placed in the correct positions. \n\nHere is the completed grid:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n>>>"
