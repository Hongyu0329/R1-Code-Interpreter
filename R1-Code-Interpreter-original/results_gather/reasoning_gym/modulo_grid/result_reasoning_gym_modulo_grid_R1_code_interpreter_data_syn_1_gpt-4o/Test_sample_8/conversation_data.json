    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid. The grid is a 20x20 matrix filled with '✅' and '❌', with one missing value represented by '❔'. \n\n### Observations:\n1. The grid seems to have a diagonal pattern of '✅'s.\n2. The '✅'s appear to be placed in a pattern that resembles a diagonal line moving from the top-left to the bottom-right.\n3. The position of '✅'s in each row seems to be increasing by one column as we move down each row.\n\n### Pattern Analysis:\n- The first row has a '✅' at position (0, 1).\n- The second row has a '✅' at position (1, 0) and (1, 2).\n- The third row has a '✅' at position (2, 1) and (2, 3).\n- The fourth row has a '✅' at position (3, 2) and (3, 4).\n- This pattern continues, with each row having a '✅' at positions that are one column apart from the previous row.\n\n### Missing Value:\n- The missing value is in the second row, seventh column (1, 6).\n- Based on the pattern, the '✅' should be at position (1, 6).\n\nLet's fill in the grid using this pattern and return the completed grid.\n\n```python\n# Define the grid with the missing value\ngrid = [\n    ['❌', '✅', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '✅', '❌', '❌', '❌'],\n    ['✅', '❌', '✅', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❔', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '✅', '❌', '❌'],\n    ['❌', '✅', '❌', '✅', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '✅', '❌'],\n    ['❌', '❌', '✅', '❌', '✅', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '✅'],\n    ['❌', '❌', '❌', '✅', '❌', '✅', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌'],\n    ['❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '✅', '❌', '✅', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌'],\n    ['❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '✅', '❌', '✅', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌'],\n    ['❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '✅', '❌', '✅', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌'],\n    ['❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '✅', '❌', '✅', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌'],\n    ['❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '✅', '❌', '✅', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌'],\n    ['❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '✅', '❌', '✅', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌'],\n    ['❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '✅', '❌', '✅', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌'],\n    ['❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '✅', '❌', '✅', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌'],\n    ['❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '✅', '❌', '✅', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌'],\n    ['❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '✅', '❌', '✅', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌'],\n    ['❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '✅', '❌', '✅', '❌', '❌', '❌'],\n    ['✅', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '✅', '❌', '✅', '❌', '❌'],\n    ['❌', '✅', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '✅', '❌', '✅', '❌'],\n    ['❌', '❌', '✅', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '✅', '❌', '✅'],\n    ['❌', '❌', '❌', '✅', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '❌', '✅', '❌']\n]\n\n# Fill in the missing value based on the pattern\ngrid[1][6] = '✅'\n\n# Print the completed grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(''.join(row))\n```\n\nThe code will fill in the missing value and print the completed grid.
