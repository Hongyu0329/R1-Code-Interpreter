    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and fill in the missing values. The grid is 20x20, and we need to determine the positions of the checkmarks (✅) based on the given pattern.\n\n### Observations:\n1. The grid has a repeating pattern every few rows.\n2. The checkmarks seem to appear in a diagonal pattern, with some rows having multiple checkmarks.\n3. The pattern repeats every 6 rows, as seen from the given grid.\n\n### Pattern Analysis:\n- The first row with a checkmark is row 1, column 4.\n- The second row with a checkmark is row 2, column 7.\n- The third row with a checkmark is row 3, column 13.\n- The fourth row with a checkmark is row 4, columns 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20.\n- The fifth row with a checkmark is row 5, column 4.\n- The sixth row with a checkmark is row 6, column 7.\n\nThe pattern repeats every 6 rows. Therefore, the 10th row should be similar to the 4th row, the 11th row should be similar to the 5th row, and so on.\n\n### Filling the Grid:\nWe will fill in the grid based on the identified pattern. Let's write a Python script to automate this process and fill in the missing values.\n\n```python\n# Initialize the grid with empty values\ngrid = [['❌' for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(20)]\n\n# Define the pattern for each set of 6 rows\npatterns = [\n    [3],  # Row 1 pattern\n    [6],  # Row 2 pattern\n    [12], # Row 3 pattern\n    [1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19], # Row 4 pattern\n    [3],  # Row 5 pattern\n    [6]   # Row 6 pattern\n]\n\n# Fill the grid based on the pattern\nfor i in range(20):\n    pattern = patterns[i % 6]\n    for col in pattern:\n        grid[i][col] = '✅'\n\n# Print the completed grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(''.join(row))\n```\n\nThis script will fill the grid based on the identified pattern and print the completed grid. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The output from the code execution indicates that the pattern was not correctly applied to the grid. Let's re-evaluate the pattern and correct the code to ensure the grid is filled accurately.\n\n### Correct Pattern Analysis:\nUpon closer inspection, the pattern should be:\n- Row 1: Column 4\n- Row 2: Column 7\n- Row 3: Column 13\n- Row 4: Columns 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20\n- Row 5: Column 4\n- Row 6: Column 7\n\nThis pattern repeats every 6 rows.
