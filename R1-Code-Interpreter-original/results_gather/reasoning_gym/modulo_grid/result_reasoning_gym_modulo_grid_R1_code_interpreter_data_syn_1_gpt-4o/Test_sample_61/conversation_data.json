    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and fill in the missing value represented by the question mark (❔). \n\n### Observations:\n1. The grid is 20 rows by 20 columns.\n2. There are two distinct patterns of check marks (✅) in the grid:\n   - In rows 2, 6, 10, 14, and 18, the check marks appear at columns 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20.\n   - In rows 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20, the check marks appear at columns 2, 6, 10, 14, and 18.\n\n### Pattern Analysis:\n- The rows with check marks are alternating every four rows.\n- The columns with check marks are also alternating every four columns, but they are offset by two columns between the two patterns.\n\n### Filling the Grid:\n- The question mark (❔) is located at row 5, column 6.\n- Based on the pattern, row 5 should not have any check marks because it is not one of the rows (2, 6, 10, 14, 18) or (4, 8, 12, 16, 20) that contain check marks.\n\nTherefore, the question mark should be replaced with a cross mark (❌).\n\nLet's fill in the grid with this understanding and provide the completed grid.\n\n```python\n# Define the grid size\nrows, cols = 20, 20\n\n# Initialize the grid with crosses\ngrid = [['❌' for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]\n\n# Fill in the check marks based on the identified pattern\nfor r in range(rows):\n    if r % 4 == 1:  # Rows 2, 6, 10, 14, 18 (0-indexed: 1, 5, 9, 13, 17)\n        for c in range(3, cols, 4):  # Columns 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 (0-indexed: 3, 7, 11, 15, 19)\n            grid[r][c] = '✅'\n    elif r % 4 == 3:  # Rows 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 (0-indexed: 3, 7, 11, 15, 19)\n        for c in range(1, cols, 4):  # Columns 2, 6, 10, 14, 18 (0-indexed: 1, 5, 9, 13, 17)\n            grid[r][c] = '✅'\n\n# Convert the grid to a string representation\ncompleted_grid = '\\n'.join(''.join(row) for row in grid)\nprint(completed_grid)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the completed grid.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the grid was filled according to the identified pattern.
