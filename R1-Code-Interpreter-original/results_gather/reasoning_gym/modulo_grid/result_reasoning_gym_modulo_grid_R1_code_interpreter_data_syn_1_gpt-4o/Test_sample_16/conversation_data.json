    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and fill in the missing values. The grid is a 20x20 matrix with some cells marked with a \"✅\" and others with a \"❌\". The pattern seems to involve a diagonal line of \"✅\" marks.\n\nLet's analyze the given grid:\n\n1. The first row has a \"✅\" at the 11th position.\n2. The second row has a \"✅\" at the 13th position.\n3. The third row has a \"✅\" at the 14th position.\n4. The fourth row has a \"✅\" at the 15th position.\n5. The fifth row has a \"✅\" at the 16th position.\n6. The sixth row has a \"✅\" at the 17th position.\n7. The seventh row has a \"✅\" at the 18th position.\n8. The eighth row has a \"✅\" at the 19th position.\n9. The ninth row has a \"✅\" at the 20th position.\n10. The tenth row has no \"✅\".\n11. The eleventh row has a \"✅\" at the 1st position.\n12. The twelfth row has a \"✅\" at the 2nd position.\n13. The thirteenth row has a \"✅\" at the 3rd position.\n14. The fourteenth row has a \"✅\" at the 4th position.\n15. The fifteenth row has a \"✅\" at the 5th position.\n16. The sixteenth row has a \"✅\" at the 6th position.\n17. The seventeenth row has a \"✅\" at the 7th position.\n18. The eighteenth row has a \"✅\" at the 8th position.\n19. The nineteenth row has a \"✅\" at the 9th position.\n20. The twentieth row has a \"✅\" at the 10th position.\n\nThe pattern appears to be a diagonal line of \"✅\" marks that starts at the 11th column in the first row and shifts one column to the right in each subsequent row until it reaches the 20th column in the ninth row. Then, it wraps around to the first column in the eleventh row and continues the diagonal pattern.\n\nThe missing value in the 18th row, 18th column should be a \"✅\" to continue this diagonal pattern.\n\nLet's fill in the grid using this pattern and print the completed grid.\n\n```python\n# Initialize a 20x20 grid with \"❌\"\ngrid = [[\"❌\" for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(20)]\n\n# Fill in the \"✅\" based on the identified pattern\nfor i in range(20):\n    if i < 9:\n        grid[i][i + 10] = \"✅\"\n    elif i > 9:\n        grid[i][i - 10] = \"✅\"\n\n# Print the completed grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(\"\".join(row))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the pattern and fill in the grid correctly.",
