    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and fill in the missing value represented by the question mark. The grid is 20x20, and we need to determine the pattern of the checkmarks (✅) to fill in the missing value.\n\n### Observations:\n1. The grid has a repeating pattern of checkmarks (✅) in certain rows and columns.\n2. The checkmarks appear to be placed in a specific sequence or pattern.\n\n### Analyzing the Pattern:\n- Let's examine the rows and columns where the checkmarks appear:\n  - Row 2: Column 6\n  - Row 3: Column 11\n  - Row 5: Column 6\n  - Row 6: Columns 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20\n  - Row 8: Column 6\n  - Row 9: Column 11\n  - Row 11: Columns 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18\n  - Row 13: Column 6\n  - Row 14: Column 11\n  - Row 16: Column 6\n  - Row 17: Column 11\n  - Row 19: Column 6\n\n### Hypothesis:\n- The checkmarks in rows 6 and 11 follow a pattern of every third column starting from a specific column.\n- The checkmarks in other rows seem to follow a pattern of appearing in columns 6 and 11.\n\n### Filling the Missing Value:\n- The question mark is located at Row 4, Column 5.\n- Based on the pattern, it seems that the checkmarks appear in columns 6 and 11 for most rows except for rows 6 and 11, which have a different pattern.\n- Since Row 4 does not follow the pattern of rows 6 and 11, it should follow the pattern of having a checkmark in column 6 or 11.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The missing value at Row 4, Column 5 should be a checkmark (✅) based on the observed pattern.\n\nLet's fill in the grid with this information and present the completed grid.\n\n```python\n# Define the grid with the identified pattern\ngrid = [\n    \"❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\",\n    \"❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\",\n    \"❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\",\n    \"❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\",\n    \"❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\",\n    \"❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅\",\n    \"❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\",\n    \"❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\",\n    \"❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\",\n    \"❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\",\n    \"❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌✅❌❌\",\n    \"❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\",\n    \"❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\",\n    \"❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\",\n    \"❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\",\n    \"❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\",\n    \"❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\",\n    \"❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\",\n    \"❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\",\n    \"❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\"\n]\n\n# Print the completed grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nExecuting the code will display the completed grid.",
