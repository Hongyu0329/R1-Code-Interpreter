    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and fill in the missing value marked by a question mark. The grid is a 20x20 matrix, and we need to determine the position of the '✅' marks.\n\n### Observations:\n1. The '✅' marks seem to follow a diagonal pattern.\n2. The positions of the '✅' marks are not on the main diagonal but appear to be on a secondary diagonal.\n3. The pattern seems to be that the '✅' marks are placed in positions where the sum of the row and column indices is constant.\n\n### Pattern Analysis:\n- Let's list the positions of the '✅' marks:\n  - (1, 6)\n  - (2, 3)\n  - (3, 2)\n  - (4, 11)\n  - (5, 5)\n  - (6, 1)\n  - (7, 9)\n  - (8, 15)\n  - (9, 7)\n  - (10, 13)\n  - (11, 12)\n  - (12, 4)\n  - (13, 10)\n  - (14, 18)\n  - (15, 14)\n  - (16, 8)\n  - (17, 17)\n  - (18, 16)\n  - (19, 19)\n\n- The missing position is (5, 20) marked by a question mark.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe pattern is that the '✅' marks are placed such that the sum of the row and column indices is a constant value. We can fill in the missing position with a '✅' mark.\n\nLet's generate the completed grid using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Initialize a 20x20 grid with '❌'\ngrid = [['❌' for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(20)]\n\n# List of positions for '✅'\npositions = [\n    (1, 6), (2, 3), (3, 2), (4, 11), (5, 5), (6, 1), (7, 9), (8, 15),\n    (9, 7), (10, 13), (11, 12), (12, 4), (13, 10), (14, 18), (15, 14),\n    (16, 8), (17, 17), (18, 16), (19, 19), (5, 20)\n]\n\n# Place '✅' in the specified positions\nfor row, col in positions:\n    grid[row-1][col-1] = '✅'\n\n# Print the completed grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(''.join(row))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the completed grid.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the grid was completed with the identified pattern. The missing '✅' was placed at position (5, 20) as expected.
