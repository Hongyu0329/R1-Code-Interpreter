    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and fill in the missing value represented by the question mark. The grid is a 20x20 matrix with a diagonal pattern of check marks (✅) and crosses (❌).\n\n### Observations:\n1. The grid has a diagonal pattern of check marks (✅) that seem to move from the bottom-left to the top-right.\n2. The position of the check marks in each row seems to follow a specific pattern.\n\n### Pattern Analysis:\n- The check mark in each row appears to be moving one column to the right as we move down each row.\n- The pattern seems to be a diagonal line from the bottom-left to the top-right.\n\n### Mathematical Pattern:\n- The position of the check mark in each row can be described by the equation: `column_index = 19 - row_index`.\n- This means that for each row `i`, the check mark is placed at the column `19 - i`.\n\n### Filling the Grid:\n- We will fill the grid using the identified pattern and replace the question mark with the correct symbol.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to fill the grid and find the missing value.\n\n```python\n# Initialize a 20x20 grid with crosses\ngrid = [['❌' for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(20)]\n\n# Fill the grid with the pattern\nfor i in range(20):\n    grid[i][19 - i] = '✅'\n\n# Print the grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(''.join(row))\n```\n\nThis code will fill the grid according to the identified pattern and print the completed grid. Let's execute this code to see the result.",
