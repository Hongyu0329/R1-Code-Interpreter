    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid. The grid is a 20x20 matrix, and we need to determine the position of the \"✅\" symbols. \n\nUpon examining the grid, it appears that the \"✅\" symbols are placed diagonally from the top-left to the bottom-right. The position of each \"✅\" seems to follow a pattern where the row index and column index are equal. \n\nLet's verify this pattern:\n- In the first row, the \"✅\" is at position (0, 6).\n- In the second row, the \"✅\" is at position (1, 7).\n- In the third row, the \"✅\" is at position (2, 8).\n- This pattern continues, with the \"✅\" moving one column to the right in each subsequent row.\n\nThe pattern can be described as follows: for each row `i`, the \"✅\" is placed at column `i + 6`. This pattern continues until the \"✅\" reaches the last column, after which it wraps around to the first column.\n\nNow, let's fill in the grid using this pattern and replace the \"❔\" with the correct symbol.\n\n```python\n# Initialize a 20x20 grid with \"❌\"\ngrid = [['❌' for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(20)]\n\n# Fill in the grid with \"✅\" following the identified pattern\nfor i in range(20):\n    col = (i + 6) % 20\n    grid[i][col] = '✅'\n\n# Print the completed grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(''.join(row))\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will print the completed grid with the correct pattern.",
    "The code executed correctly and produced the expected output, which matches the pattern we identified. The \"✅\" symbols are placed diagonally, starting from the 7th column in the first row and wrapping around after reaching the last column. \n\nThe completed grid is as follows:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅  \n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n>>>"
