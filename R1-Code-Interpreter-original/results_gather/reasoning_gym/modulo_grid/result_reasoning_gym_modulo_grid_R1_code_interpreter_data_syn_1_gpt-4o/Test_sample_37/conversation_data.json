    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and fill in the missing value represented by the question mark. \n\n### Observations:\n1. The grid is 20x20, and the pattern involves placing a ✅ in a specific column for each row.\n2. The column with the ✅ is consistent for every second row, specifically in the 14th column.\n3. The pattern seems to be that every second row (starting from the second row) has a ✅ in the 14th column.\n\n### Pattern Analysis:\n- The rows with a ✅ in the 14th column are: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20.\n- The question mark is located in the 17th row, 11th column.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Based on the pattern, the 17th row should not have a ✅ in the 11th column because the pattern places a ✅ in the 14th column for every second row starting from the second row.\n- Therefore, the question mark should be replaced with ❌.\n\nLet's fill in the grid with this understanding:\n\n```python\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [['❌' for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(20)]\n\n# Place the ✅ according to the identified pattern\nfor i in range(1, 20, 2):\n    grid[i][13] = '✅'\n\n# Replace the question mark with ❌\ngrid[16][10] = '❌'\n\n# Print the completed grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(''.join(row))\n```\n\nExecuting this code will provide the completed grid.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the grid was filled according to the identified pattern. The pattern places a ✅ in the 14th column for every second row starting from the second row. The question mark was replaced with ❌, as it did not fit the pattern of having a ✅ in the 11th column.\n\nHere is the completed grid:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n>>>"
