    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and fill in the missing value represented by the question mark. Let's analyze the grid:\n\n1. The grid is 20 rows by 20 columns.\n2. The first row is entirely filled with ✅.\n3. The last column is filled with ❌ except for the first row.\n4. The pattern in the grid seems to repeat every 4 rows, with the 4th row being a sequence of alternating ✅ and ❌.\n5. The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th rows in each 4-row block have a similar pattern, with the 2nd row having a single ✅ in the second column, the 3rd row having two ✅s, and the 4th row having a sequence of alternating ✅ and ❌.\n\nThe question mark is located in the 2nd row, 9th column. Based on the pattern, the 2nd row in each 4-row block has a single ✅ in the second column, and the rest are ❌. Therefore, the question mark should be replaced with ❌.\n\nLet's fill in the grid with this understanding:\n\n```python\n# Define the grid with the identified pattern\ngrid = [\n    ['✅'] * 20,\n    ['❌', '✅'] + ['❌'] * 17,\n    ['❌', '✅'] + ['❌'] * 6 + ['✅', '❌'] + ['❌'] * 6 + ['✅', '❌'] * 2,\n    ['❌', '✅'] + ['❌'] * 17,\n    ['❌', '✅', '❌', '✅', '❌', '✅', '❌', '✅', '❌', '✅', '❌', '✅', '❌', '✅', '❌', '✅', '❌', '✅', '❌', '✅'],\n    ['❌', '✅'] + ['❌'] * 17,\n    ['❌', '✅'] + ['❌'] * 6 + ['✅', '❌'] + ['❌'] * 6 + ['✅', '❌'] * 2,\n    ['❌', '✅'] + ['❌'] * 17,\n    ['❌', '✅', '❌', '✅', '❌', '✅', '❌', '✅', '❌', '✅', '❌', '✅', '❌', '✅', '❌', '✅', '❌', '✅', '❌', '✅'],\n    ['❌', '✅'] + ['❌'] * 17,\n    ['❌', '✅'] + ['❌'] * 6 + ['✅', '❌'] + ['❌'] * 6 + ['✅', '❌'] * 2,\n    ['❌', '✅'] + ['❌'] * 17,\n    ['❌', '✅', '❌', '✅', '❌', '✅', '❌', '✅', '❌', '✅', '❌', '✅', '❌', '✅', '❌', '✅', '❌', '✅', '❌', '✅'],\n    ['❌', '✅'] + ['❌'] * 17,\n    ['❌', '✅'] + ['❌'] * 6 + ['✅', '❌'] + ['❌'] * 6 + ['✅', '❌'] * 2,\n    ['❌', '✅'] + ['❌'] * 17,\n    ['❌', '✅', '❌', '✅', '❌', '✅', '❌', '✅', '❌', '✅', '❌', '✅', '❌', '✅', '❌', '✅', '❌', '✅', '❌', '✅'],\n    ['❌', '✅'] + ['❌'] * 17,\n    ['❌', '✅'] + ['❌'] * 6 + ['✅', '❌'] + ['❌'] * 6 + ['✅', '❌'] * 2,\n    ['❌', '✅'] + ['❌'] * 17\n]\n\n# Print the completed grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(''.join(row))\n```\n\nThe code will generate the completed grid based on the identified pattern.
