    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the question marks. Let's analyze the grid:\n\n1. The grid is 20x20, and we have some cells marked with \"✅\".\n2. The positions of the \"✅\" seem to follow a specific pattern.\n\nLet's list the positions of the \"✅\" marks:\n\n- Row 2, Column 11\n- Row 3, Column 6\n- Row 3, Column 13\n- Row 3, Column 20\n- Row 4, Column 9\n- Row 5, Column 7\n- Row 5, Column 14\n- Row 6, Column 3\n- Row 6, Column 17\n- Row 7, Column 5\n- Row 7, Column 12\n- Row 7, Column 19\n- Row 9, Column 4\n- Row 9, Column 10\n- Row 9, Column 17\n- Row 10, Column 13\n- Row 11, Column 2\n- Row 11, Column 9\n- Row 11, Column 16\n- Row 12, Column 7\n- Row 13, Column 3\n- Row 13, Column 10\n- Row 13, Column 17\n- Row 14, Column 5\n- Row 14, Column 19\n- Row 16, Column 11\n- Row 17, Column 6\n- Row 17, Column 13\n- Row 17, Column 20\n- Row 18, Column 9\n- Row 19, Column 7\n- Row 19, Column 14\n- Row 20, Column 3\n- Row 20, Column 17\n\nFrom this, we can see that the pattern is not straightforward, but it seems to involve a sequence of numbers that repeat every few rows. Let's try to identify the pattern using Python code to automate the process of finding the sequence.\n\n```python\n# Define the grid size\ngrid_size = 20\n\n# Define the positions of the \"✅\" marks\npositions = [\n    (2, 11), (3, 6), (3, 13), (3, 20), (4, 9), (5, 7), (5, 14),\n    (6, 3), (6, 17), (7, 5), (7, 12), (7, 19), (9, 4), (9, 10),\n    (9, 17), (10, 13), (11, 2), (11, 9), (11, 16), (12, 7),\n    (13, 3), (13, 10), (13, 17), (14, 5), (14, 19), (16, 11),\n    (17, 6), (17, 13), (17, 20), (18, 9), (19, 7), (19, 14),\n    (20, 3), (20, 17)\n]\n\n# Initialize the grid with \"❌\"\ngrid = [['❌' for _ in range(grid_size)] for _ in range(grid_size)]\n\n# Fill the grid with \"✅\" at the specified positions\nfor row, col in positions:\n    grid[row - 1][col - 1] = '✅'\n\n# Print the grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(''.join(row))\n```\n\nThe code will print the grid with the \"✅\" marks filled in. Let's execute this code to see the pattern and identify the missing \"✅\" marks.",
    "The output of the code matches the initial grid provided, with the \"✅\" marks placed correctly according to the given positions. Now, let's analyze the pattern further to fill in the missing \"✅\" marks.\n\nUpon examining the grid, it seems that the \"✅\" marks are placed in a pattern that repeats every few rows. Let's try to identify the sequence of columns for each row where \"✅\" appears:\n\n- Row 2: Column 11\n- Row 3: Columns 6, 13, 20\n- Row 4: Column 9\n- Row 5: Columns 7, 14\n- Row 6: Columns 3, 17\n- Row 7: Columns 5, 12, 19\n- Row 9: Columns 4, 10, 17\n- Row 10: Column 13\n- Row 11: Columns 2, 9, 16\n- Row 12: Column 7\n- Row 13: Columns 3, 10, 17\n- Row 14: Columns 5, 19\n- Row 16: Column 11\n- Row 17: Columns 6, 13, 20\n- Row 18: Column 9\n- Row 19: Columns 7, 14\n- Row 20: Columns 3, 17\n\nThe pattern seems to involve a sequence of columns that repeat every few rows. Let's try to identify the missing \"✅\" marks by filling in the question marks based on this pattern.\n\nThe missing \"✅\" mark is in Row 17, Column 8. Let's update the grid to include this missing mark.\n\n```python\n# Define the grid size\ngrid_size = 20\n\n# Define the positions of the \"✅\" marks, including the missing one\npositions = [\n    (2, 11), (3, 6), (3, 13), (3, 20), (4, 9), (5, 7), (5, 14),\n    (6, 3), (6, 17), (7, 5), (7, 12), (7, 19), (9, 4), (9, 10),\n    (9, 17), (10, 13), (11, 2), (11, 9), (11, 16), (12, 7),\n    (13, 3), (13, 10), (13, 17), (14, 5), (14, 19), (16, 11),\n    (17, 6), (17, 8), (17, 13), (17, 20), (18, 9), (19, 7),\n    (19, 14), (20, 3), (20, 17)\n]\n\n# Initialize the grid with \"❌\"\ngrid = [['❌' for _ in range(grid_size)] for _ in range(grid_size)]\n\n# Fill the grid with \"✅\" at the specified positions\nfor row, col in positions:\n    grid[row - 1][col - 1] = '✅'\n\n# Print the grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(''.join(row))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to see the completed grid.",
