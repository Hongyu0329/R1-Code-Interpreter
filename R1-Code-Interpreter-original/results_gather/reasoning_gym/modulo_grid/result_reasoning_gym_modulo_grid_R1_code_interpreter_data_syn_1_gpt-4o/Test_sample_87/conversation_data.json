    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the missing value represented by the question mark. \n\n### Observations:\n1. The grid is 20 rows by 20 columns.\n2. The pattern of `✅` and `❌` seems to repeat every few rows and columns.\n3. The `✅` symbols appear to be aligned in a specific pattern that repeats.\n\n### Pattern Analysis:\n- The `✅` symbols appear in a diagonal pattern.\n- The pattern seems to repeat every 4 rows and 4 columns.\n- The rows with `✅` symbols are: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20.\n- The columns with `✅` symbols are: 7, 11, 15, 19.\n\n### Filling the Grid:\n- The question mark is located at row 4, column 3.\n- Based on the pattern, row 4 should have a `✅` at column 7.\n- Therefore, the question mark should be replaced with a `❌`.\n\nLet's fill in the grid with this understanding and return the completed grid.\n\n```python\n# Define the grid with the pattern\ngrid = [\n    \"❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\",\n    \"❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\",\n    \"❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌\",\n    \"❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\",\n    \"❌❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌\",\n    \"❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\",\n    \"❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌\",\n    \"❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\",\n    \"❌❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌\",\n    \"❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\",\n    \"❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌\",\n    \"❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\",\n    \"❌❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌\",\n    \"❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\",\n    \"❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌\",\n    \"❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\",\n    \"❌❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌❌❌✅❌✅❌✅❌✅❌\",\n    \"❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\",\n    \"❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌✅❌❌❌\",\n    \"❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\"\n]\n\n# Print the completed grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will print the completed grid with the question mark replaced by the correct symbol based on the identified pattern.",
