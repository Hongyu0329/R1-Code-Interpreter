    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid. The grid is 20x20, and we have some cells marked with \"✅\" and others with \"❌\". We need to determine the pattern that dictates the placement of \"✅\" and fill in the missing \"?\" with either \"✅\" or \"❌\".\n\n### Observations:\n1. The \"✅\" marks appear to be placed in a repeating pattern.\n2. The pattern seems to repeat every few rows and columns.\n\n### Steps to Identify the Pattern:\n- Look at the positions of the \"✅\" marks.\n- Check if there is a consistent interval between the \"✅\" marks in both rows and columns.\n- Verify if the pattern repeats after a certain number of rows and columns.\n\n### Analysis:\n- The \"✅\" marks appear at specific intervals in both rows and columns.\n- By examining the grid, we can see that the \"✅\" marks are placed in a diagonal pattern that repeats every 6 rows and 10 columns.\n\n### Pattern:\n- The \"✅\" marks are placed at positions where both the row and column indices satisfy a certain modular arithmetic condition.\n\n### Code Implementation:\nLet's write a Python script to fill in the grid based on the identified pattern.\n\n```python\n# Initialize a 20x20 grid with \"❌\"\ngrid = [[\"❌\" for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(20)]\n\n# Fill the grid based on the identified pattern\nfor i in range(20):\n    for j in range(20):\n        if i % 6 == 2 and j % 10 == 2:\n            grid[i][j] = \"✅\"\n\n# Print the completed grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(\"\".join(row))\n```\n\nThis code will fill the grid according to the pattern we identified and print the completed grid. Let's execute this code to see the result.",
