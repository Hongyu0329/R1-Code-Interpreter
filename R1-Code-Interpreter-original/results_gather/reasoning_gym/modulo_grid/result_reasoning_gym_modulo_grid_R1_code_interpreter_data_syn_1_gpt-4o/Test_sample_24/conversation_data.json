    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern that determines the placement of the checkmarks (✅) and crosses (❌) in the grid. The grid is 20 rows by 20 columns, and we need to fill in the question mark with either a checkmark or a cross.\n\n### Observations:\n1. The first row is entirely filled with checkmarks.\n2. The first column of each subsequent row (from the second row onwards) starts with a checkmark.\n3. The last column of each row ends with a checkmark.\n4. There seems to be a pattern in the placement of checkmarks in the middle of the grid.\n\n### Pattern Analysis:\n- The checkmarks appear to be placed in a diagonal pattern, with some rows having additional checkmarks at specific intervals.\n- The pattern seems to repeat every 6 rows, with a similar structure in each block of 6 rows.\n\n### Hypothesis:\n- The grid might be following a pattern where checkmarks are placed at specific intervals, possibly related to the row and column indices.\n\n### Plan:\n1. Analyze the pattern of checkmarks in the grid.\n2. Determine the rule for placing checkmarks.\n3.
