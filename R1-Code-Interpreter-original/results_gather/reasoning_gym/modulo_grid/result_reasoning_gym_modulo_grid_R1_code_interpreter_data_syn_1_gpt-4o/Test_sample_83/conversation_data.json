    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid. The grid is a 20x20 matrix, and we need to determine the positions of the '✅' marks. \n\nUpon examining the grid, it appears that the '✅' marks are placed in a diagonal pattern. Specifically, the '✅' marks seem to be placed in positions where the sum of the row index and column index equals a constant value. \n\nLet's analyze the pattern:\n- In the first row, the '✅' is at the 8th position (index 7).\n- In the second row, the '✅' is at the 7th position (index 6).\n- In the third row, the '✅' is at the 6th position (index 5).\n- This pattern continues, with the '✅' moving one position to the left in each subsequent row.\n\nThe pattern suggests that the '✅' is placed at position (i, 19-i) for each row i, where i ranges from 0 to 19. \n\nNow, let's fill in the grid using this pattern and replace the '?' with the correct value.\n\n```python\n# Initialize a 20x20 grid with '❌'\ngrid = [['❌' for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(20)]\n\n# Fill in the '✅' based on the identified pattern\nfor i in range(20):\n    grid[i][19-i] = '✅'\n\n# Print the completed grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(''.join(row))\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will print the completed grid with the correct pattern.",
    "The code executed correctly and produced the expected output, which matches the pattern we identified. The '✅' marks are placed in a diagonal pattern from the bottom-left to the top-right of the grid. \n\nNow, let's provide the final answer by enclosing the completed grid within triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n>>>"
