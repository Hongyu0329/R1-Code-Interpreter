    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the question marks. The grid is a 20x20 matrix, and we need to determine the position of the \"✅\" symbols.\n\n### Observations:\n1. The grid has a diagonal pattern of \"✅\" symbols.\n2. The first half of the grid (from top to bottom) has \"✅\" symbols moving from right to left, starting from the top-right corner.\n3. The second half of the grid (from bottom to top) has \"✅\" symbols moving from left to right, starting from the bottom-left corner.\n4. The question mark is located in the 7th row and 2nd column.\n\n### Pattern Analysis:\n- For the first half (top to bottom), the \"✅\" symbols are located at positions (i, 20-i) for i ranging from 1 to 10.\n- For the second half (bottom to top), the \"✅\" symbols are located at positions (20-i, i) for i ranging from 1 to 10.\n\n### Filling the Grid:\nWe will fill the grid based on the identified pattern and replace the question mark with the appropriate symbol.\n\nLet's write a Python script to generate the completed grid.\n\n```python\n# Initialize a 20x20 grid with \"❌\"\ngrid = [['❌' for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(20)]\n\n# Fill the grid based on the identified pattern\nfor i in range(1, 11):\n    grid[i-1][20-i] = '✅'  # Top-right to bottom-left diagonal\n    grid[20-i][i-1] = '✅'  # Bottom-left to top-right diagonal\n\n# Print the completed grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(''.join(row))\n```\n\nThis code will generate the completed grid by filling in the \"✅\" symbols according to the identified pattern. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed correctly and produced the expected output, which is the completed grid with the \"✅\" symbols filled in according to the identified pattern. The grid is now complete, and the question mark has been replaced with the correct symbol.\n\nHere is the completed grid:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n>>>"
