    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and then use it to fill in the missing value. \n\n### Observations:\n1. The grid is 20x20.\n2. There are two diagonal lines of '✅' symbols, one starting from the top-right corner and moving downwards to the left, and another starting from the bottom-left corner and moving upwards to the right.\n3. The first diagonal line starts at (0, 14) and ends at (5, 19).\n4. The second diagonal line starts at (14, 0) and ends at (19, 5).\n\n### Pattern Analysis:\n- The first diagonal line can be described by the equation: `row + column = 14`.\n- The second diagonal line can be described by the equation: `row - column = 14`.\n\n### Task:\n- We need to fill in the missing value at position (11, 7) in the grid.\n\n### Solution:\n- Check if the position (11, 7) satisfies either of the diagonal equations:\n  - For the first diagonal: `11 + 7 = 18` (not equal to 14)\n  - For the second diagonal: `11 - 7 = 4` (not equal to 14)\n\nSince neither condition is satisfied, the position (11, 7) should be marked with '❌'.\n\nLet's generate the completed grid using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Initialize a 20x20 grid with '❌'\ngrid = [['❌' for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(20)]\n\n# Fill the grid based on the identified patterns\nfor row in range(20):\n    for col in range(20):\n        if row + col == 14 or row - col == 14:\n            grid[row][col] = '✅'\n\n# Print the completed grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(''.join(row))\n```\n\nThe code will generate the completed grid, and we will use the output to provide the final answer.",
    "The code output matches the expected pattern, confirming that the grid has been correctly filled based on the identified mathematical pattern. The missing value at position (11, 7) is indeed '❌', as it does not satisfy either of the diagonal conditions.\n\nHere is the completed grid:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n>>>"
