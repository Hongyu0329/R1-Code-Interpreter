    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and fill in the missing values. The grid is 20x20, and we need to determine the positions of the ✅ marks.\n\n### Observations:\n1. The grid has a repeating pattern of ✅ marks.\n2. The pattern seems to repeat every 4 rows and every 4 columns.\n3. The positions of the ✅ marks in the first few rows are:\n   - Row 1: Column 4, 9, 14, 19\n   - Row 4: Column 3, 8, 13, 18\n   - Row 6: Column 4, 9, 14, 19\n   - Row 8: Column 3, 8, 13, 18\n4. The pattern repeats every 4 rows, with the same column positions for the ✅ marks.\n\n### Pattern Analysis:\n- The pattern of ✅ marks is consistent in every 4th row.\n- The columns for the ✅ marks alternate between two sets:\n  - Set 1: Columns 4, 9, 14, 19\n  - Set 2: Columns 3, 8, 13, 18\n\n### Filling the Grid:\n- We will fill the grid by alternating the column sets every 2 rows, starting from row 1.\n\nLet's write a Python script to fill in the grid based on this pattern.\n\n```python\n# Initialize the grid with ❌\ngrid = [['❌' for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(20)]\n\n# Define the column sets for the pattern\ncolumns_set_1 = [3, 8, 13, 18]\ncolumns_set_2 = [4, 9, 14, 19]\n\n# Fill the grid based on the identified pattern\nfor row in range(20):\n    if row % 4 == 1 or row % 4 == 2:\n        for col in columns_set_2:\n            grid[row][col] = '✅'\n    elif row % 4 == 3 or row % 4 == 0:\n        for col in columns_set_1:\n            grid[row][col] = '✅'\n\n# Print the completed grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(''.join(row))\n```\n\nThis script will fill the grid according to the identified pattern and print the completed grid. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The output of the code does not match the expected pattern. Let's re-evaluate the pattern and correct the code.\n\n### Observations:\n1.
