    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and use it to fill in the question mark. The grid is a 20x20 matrix, and we need to determine the pattern of the '✅' symbols.\n\n### Observations:\n1. The '✅' symbols appear in a vertical line in the 6th column and the 13th column.\n2. The '✅' symbols appear at regular intervals in these columns.\n\n### Pattern Analysis:\n- The '✅' symbols appear in the 6th and 13th columns at every 5th row starting from the 5th row. This means they appear at rows 5, 10, 15, etc., in both columns.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- The pattern is that '✅' appears in the 6th and 13th columns at every 5th row starting from the 5th row.\n- The question mark is located at the 2nd row and 17th column, which does not follow the pattern of the '✅' symbols. Therefore, it should be replaced with '❌'.\n\nLet's fill in the grid based on this pattern and provide the completed grid.\n\n```python\n# Define the grid size\nrows, cols = 20, 20\n\n# Initialize the grid with '❌'\ngrid = [['❌' for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]\n\n# Place '✅' according to the identified pattern\nfor row in range(4, rows, 5):\n    grid[row][5] = '✅'\n    grid[row][12] = '✅'\n\n# Replace the '?' with '❌'\ngrid[1][16] = '❌'\n\n# Print the completed grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(''.join(row))\n```\n\nExecuting this code will generate the completed grid.",
    "The output of the code does not match the expected pattern. Let's re-evaluate the pattern and correct the code.\n\n### Observations:\n1. The '✅' symbols appear in the 6th and 13th columns.\n2. They appear at every 5th row starting from the 5th row (0-indexed, which is the 6th row in 1-indexed).\n\n### Corrected Pattern:\n- '✅' appears in the 6th and 13th columns at rows 5, 10, 15, etc., in both columns.\n\n### Corrected Code:\nLet's correct the code to ensure it places the '✅' symbols correctly and fills the grid accurately.\n\n```python\n# Define the grid size\nrows, cols = 20, 20\n\n# Initialize the grid with '❌'\ngrid = [['❌' for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]\n\n# Place '✅' according to the identified pattern\nfor row in range(5, rows, 5):\n    grid[row][5] = '✅'\n    grid[row][12] = '✅'\n\n# Replace the '?' with '❌'\ngrid[1][16] = '❌'\n\n# Print the completed grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(''.join(row))\n```\n\nExecuting this code will generate the completed grid with the correct pattern.",
