    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and fill in the missing question mark. The grid is a 20x20 matrix with some cells marked with a \"✅\" and others with a \"❌\". \n\nLet's analyze the positions of the \"✅\" marks:\n\n1. The positions of the \"✅\" marks are as follows:\n   - (1, 15)\n   - (2, 8)\n   - (3, 17)\n   - (4, 13)\n   - (5, 12)\n   - (6, 14)\n   - (7, 9)\n   - (8, 3) and (8, 20)\n   - (9, 7)\n   - (10, 11)\n   - (11, 16)\n   - (12, 10)\n   - (13, 5)\n   - (14, 6)\n   - (15, 2) and (15, 19)\n   - (16, 10)\n   - (17, 4)\n   - (19, 15)\n   - (20, 8)\n\n2. Observing the pattern, it seems that the positions of the \"✅\" marks are determined by a certain sequence or rule. \n\n3. Let's try to identify a mathematical pattern or sequence that fits these positions. One possible approach is to check if there is a consistent mathematical operation or sequence that can be applied to the row numbers to get the column numbers.\n\n4. We notice that the positions of the \"✅\" marks seem to follow a pattern where the column number is related to the row number in a non-linear way. \n\n5. Let's write a Python script to check for a possible pattern or sequence that fits these positions and determine the missing position.\n\n```python\n# Define the positions of the \"✅\" marks\npositions = [\n    (1, 15), (2, 8), (3, 17), (4, 13), (5, 12), (6, 14), (7, 9),\n    (8, 3), (8, 20), (9, 7), (10, 11), (11, 16), (12, 10), (13, 5),\n    (14, 6), (15, 2), (15, 19), (16, 10), (17, 4), (19, 15), (20, 8)\n]\n\n# Create a 20x20 grid initialized with \"❌\"\ngrid = [[\"❌\" for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(20)]\n\n# Fill the grid with \"✅\" based on the positions\nfor row, col in positions:\n    grid[row - 1][col - 1] = \"✅\"\n\n# Print the grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(\"\".join(row))\n```\n\nThis script will help us visualize the grid and check for any patterns. Let's execute it to see the output.",
