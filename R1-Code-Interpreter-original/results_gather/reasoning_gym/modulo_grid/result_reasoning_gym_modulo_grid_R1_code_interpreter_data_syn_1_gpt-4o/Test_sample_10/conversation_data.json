    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and fill in the missing value represented by the question mark. \n\n### Observations:\n1. The grid is 20x20 in size.\n2. There are two distinct patterns of check marks (✅) in the grid:\n   - A vertical pattern that repeats every 5 rows.\n   - A horizontal pattern that repeats every 4 columns.\n\n### Pattern Analysis:\n- **Vertical Pattern**: \n  - In every 5th row starting from the second row (i.e., rows 2, 6, 10, 14, 18), there is a check mark in every 4th column starting from the second column (i.e., columns 2, 6, 10, 14, 18).\n  \n- **Horizontal Pattern**:\n  - In every 4th row starting from the fourth row (i.e., rows 4, 8, 12, 16, 20), there is a check mark in every 4th column starting from the fourth column (i.e., columns 4, 8, 12, 16, 20).\n\n### Filling the Grid:\n- The question mark is located at row 8, column 8. According to the horizontal pattern, this position should be a check mark (✅).\n\nLet's fill in the grid with this pattern and provide the completed grid.\n\n```python\n# Define the grid size\nrows, cols = 20, 20\n\n# Initialize the grid with ❌\ngrid = [['❌' for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]\n\n# Apply the vertical pattern\nfor r in range(1, rows, 5):\n    for c in range(1, cols, 4):\n        grid[r][c] = '✅'\n\n# Apply the horizontal pattern\nfor r in range(3, rows, 4):\n    for c in range(3, cols, 4):\n        grid[r][c] = '✅'\n\n# Convert the grid to a string format\ncompleted_grid = '\\n'.join([''.join(row) for row in grid])\n\nprint(completed_grid)\n```\n\nThe code will generate the completed grid based on the identified patterns. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the grid was filled according to the identified patterns.
