    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and fill in the missing values. Let's analyze the grid:\n\n1. The grid is 20 rows by 20 columns.\n2. The pattern of '✅' appears to be consistent in certain rows and columns.\n\nLet's break down the pattern:\n\n- In rows 3, 9, 15, and 21 (if it existed), the '✅' appears in columns 9 and 17.\n- In rows 5, 11, 17, and 23 (if it existed), the '✅' appears in columns 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18.\n\nThe pattern seems to repeat every 6 rows, with '✅' appearing in specific columns. Let's write a Python script to fill in the grid based on this pattern.\n\n```python\n# Initialize the grid with '❌'\ngrid = [['❌' for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(20)]\n\n# Define the pattern for '✅'\npattern_rows = [2, 8, 14, 20]  # 0-indexed rows for pattern 1\npattern_cols_1 = [8, 16]       # 0-indexed columns for pattern 1\n\npattern_rows_2 = [4, 10, 16]   # 0-indexed rows for pattern 2\npattern_cols_2 = [2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17]  # 0-indexed columns for pattern 2\n\n# Apply the pattern to the grid\nfor row in pattern_rows:\n    for col in pattern_cols_1:\n        grid[row][col] = '✅'\n\nfor row in pattern_rows_2:\n    for col in pattern_cols_2:\n        grid[row][col] = '✅'\n\n# Print the completed grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(''.join(row))\n```\n\nThis code will fill in the grid based on the identified pattern. Let's execute it to see the completed grid.",
    "The error indicates that the code is trying to access an index that is out of range for the grid. This is likely because the pattern rows and columns are defined using 1-based indexing, but Python uses 0-based indexing. Let's adjust the indices accordingly and re-run the code.\n\n```python\n# Initialize the grid with '❌'\ngrid = [['❌' for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(20)]\n\n# Define the pattern for '✅'\npattern_rows_1 = [2, 8, 14]  # 0-indexed rows for pattern 1\npattern_cols_1 = [8, 16]     # 0-indexed columns for pattern 1\n\npattern_rows_2 = [3, 9, 15]  # 0-indexed rows for pattern 2\npattern_cols_2 = [2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17]  # 0-indexed columns for pattern 2\n\n# Apply the pattern to the grid\nfor row in pattern_rows_1:\n    for col in pattern_cols_1:\n        grid[row][col] = '✅'\n\nfor row in pattern_rows_2:\n    for col in pattern_cols_2:\n        grid[row][col] = '✅'\n\n# Print the completed grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(''.join(row))\n```\n\nThis code should correctly fill in the grid without any index errors.

    "The output shows that the pattern is not being applied correctly across the entire grid. It seems that the pattern is not repeating as expected.
