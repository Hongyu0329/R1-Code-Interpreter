    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid. The grid is a 20x20 matrix with some cells marked with a \"✅\" and others with a \"❌\". The task is to identify the pattern and fill in the missing \"?\" with either \"✅\" or \"❌\".\n\n### Observations:\n1. The grid seems to have a diagonal pattern where \"✅\" appears to move from the top-left to the bottom-right.\n2. The \"✅\" appears to be moving one step down and one step to the right in each subsequent row.\n3. The pattern seems to repeat every 20 rows, which is the size of the grid.\n\n### Pattern Analysis:\n- The \"✅\" appears at positions where the row index equals the column index, i.e., on the main diagonal.\n- The grid is symmetric in terms of the pattern, and the \"✅\" moves diagonally from the top-left to the bottom-right.\n\n### Filling the Grid:\n- We will iterate over each row and column of the grid.\n- If the row index equals the column index, we place a \"✅\".\n- Otherwise, we place a \"❌\".\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to fill in the grid and replace the \"?\" with the correct symbol.\n\n```python\n# Initialize a 20x20 grid with \"❌\"\ngrid = [[\"❌\" for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(20)]\n\n# Fill the grid based on the identified pattern\nfor i in range(20):\n    grid[i][i] = \"✅\"\n\n# Convert the grid to the required format\ncompleted_grid = \"\\n\".join([\"\".join(row) for row in grid])\n\nprint(completed_grid)\n```\n\nThis code will generate the completed grid based on the identified pattern. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code executed correctly and produced the expected output, which is a 20x20 grid with \"✅\" on the main diagonal and \"❌\" elsewhere. This matches the pattern observed in the original grid, where the \"✅\" moves diagonally from the top-left to the bottom-right.\n\nThe grid is now complete, and the missing \"?\" has been replaced with the correct symbol based on the identified pattern.\n\nHere is the completed grid:\n\n<<<\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n>>>"
