    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and fill in the missing question mark. The grid is a 20x20 matrix with a single \"✅\" in each row, and the rest of the elements are \"❌\". The position of the \"✅\" seems to follow a diagonal pattern from the bottom left to the top right.\n\nLet's analyze the given grid:\n\n1. The first row has a \"✅\" at the 6th position.\n2. The second row has a \"✅\" at the 5th position.\n3. The third row has a \"✅\" at the 4th position.\n4. The fourth row has a \"✅\" at the 3rd position.\n5. The fifth row has a \"✅\" at the 2nd position.\n6. The sixth row has a \"✅\" at the 1st position.\n\nFrom the 7th row onwards, the \"✅\" starts moving from the 1st position to the right:\n\n7. The seventh row has a \"✅\" at the 1st position.\n8. The eighth row has a \"✅\" at the 2nd position.\n9. The ninth row has a \"✅\" at the 3rd position.\n10. The tenth row has a \"✅\" at the 4th position.\n11. The eleventh row has a \"✅\" at the 5th position.\n12. The twelfth row has a \"✅\" at the 6th position.\n13. The thirteenth row has a \"✅\" at the 7th position.\n14. The fourteenth row has a \"✅\" at the 8th position.\n15. The fifteenth row has a \"✅\" at the 9th position.\n16. The sixteenth row has a \"✅\" at the 10th position.\n17. The seventeenth row has a \"✅\" at the 11th position.\n18. The eighteenth row has a \"✅\" at the 12th position.\n19. The nineteenth row has a \"✅\" at the 13th position.\n20. The twentieth row has a \"✅\" at the 14th position.\n\nThe pattern is a diagonal line that starts from the 6th column in the first row and moves to the 1st column in the 6th row, then continues from the 1st column in the 7th row to the 14th column in the 20th row.\n\nNow, let's fill in the grid using this pattern:\n\n```python\n# Initialize a 20x20 grid with \"❌\"\ngrid = [[\"❌\" for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(20)]\n\n# Fill in the \"✅\" based on the identified pattern\nfor i in range(20):\n    if i < 6:\n        grid[i][5 - i] = \"✅\"\n    else:\n        grid[i][i - 6] = \"✅\"\n\n# Print the completed grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(\"\".join(row))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the completed grid.",
    "The code executed correctly and filled in the grid based on the identified pattern. The pattern is a diagonal line that starts from the 6th column in the first row and moves to the 1st column in the 6th row, then continues from the 1st column in the 7th row to the 14th column in the 20th row.\n\nHere is the completed grid:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n>>>"
