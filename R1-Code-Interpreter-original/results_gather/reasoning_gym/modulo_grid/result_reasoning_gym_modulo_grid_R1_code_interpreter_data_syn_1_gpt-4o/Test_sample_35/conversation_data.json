    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid where the \"✅\" symbols are placed. The grid is 20x20, and we need to determine the positions of the \"✅\" symbols based on the given pattern.\n\nLet's analyze the positions of the \"✅\" symbols:\n\n1. (1, 14)\n2. (2, 8)\n3. (4, 11)\n4. (8, 3)\n5. (8, 17)\n6. (9, 13)\n7. (12, 5)\n8. (12, 19)\n9. (13, 9)\n10. (14, 8)\n11. (15, 2)\n12. (15, 16)\n13. (17, 14)\n14. (18, 8)\n15. (20, 12)\n\nThe pattern seems to involve a specific sequence or rule that determines the placement of the \"✅\" symbols. Let's try to identify the pattern by examining the differences between the row and column indices.\n\nOne possible approach is to check if there is a consistent mathematical relationship between the row and column indices of the \"✅\" symbols. We can write a Python script to help identify this pattern by checking various mathematical relationships.\n\n```python\n# Define the positions of the \"✅\" symbols\npositions = [\n    (1, 14), (2, 8), (4, 11), (8, 3), (8, 17), \n    (9, 13), (12, 5), (12, 19), (13, 9), (14, 8), \n    (15, 2), (15, 16), (17, 14), (18, 8), (20, 12)\n]\n\n# Check for a pattern in the positions\ndef find_pattern(positions):\n    for row, col in positions:\n        # Check if there is a consistent pattern\n        # For example, check if the sum or difference of row and col is constant\n        # Or if there is a consistent modulo operation\n        # This is a placeholder for the actual pattern check\n        print(f\"Row: {row}, Col: {col}, Sum: {row + col}, Diff: {row - col}\")\n\nfind_pattern(positions)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to see if we can identify a pattern.",
    "From the output, we can observe the following:\n\n- The sum of the row and column indices varies, but there are some repeated values: 15, 22, 31.\n- The difference between the row and column indices also varies, but there are some repeated values: -7, 4, 6.\n\nThe pattern is not immediately obvious from the sums or differences alone. Let's try another approach by examining the positions more closely.
