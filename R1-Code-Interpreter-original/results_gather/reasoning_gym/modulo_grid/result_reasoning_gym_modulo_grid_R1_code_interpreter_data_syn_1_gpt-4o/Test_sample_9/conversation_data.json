    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and fill in the missing value represented by the question mark. \n\nUpon examining the grid, we can see that there is a diagonal pattern of check marks (✅) that starts from the top right corner and moves diagonally downwards to the bottom left corner. This pattern is consistent in both the top half and the bottom half of the grid.\n\nThe grid is 20x20, and the pattern seems to be that the check mark moves one position to the left and one position down in each subsequent row. This means that for each row `i`, the check mark is located at column `20 - i - 1`.\n\nLet's write a Python script to fill in the grid based on this pattern and replace the question mark with the correct symbol.\n\n```python\n# Initialize a 20x20 grid with '❌'\ngrid = [['❌' for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(20)]\n\n# Fill in the grid based on the identified pattern\nfor i in range(20):\n    grid[i][20 - i - 1] = '✅'\n\n# Print the completed grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(''.join(row))\n```\n\nThis script initializes a 20x20 grid filled with '❌', then iterates over each row to place a '✅' at the correct position according to the identified pattern. Finally, it prints the completed grid. Let's execute this code to see the result.",

The pattern is a diagonal line of check marks (✅) that starts from the top right corner and moves diagonally downwards to the bottom left corner.
