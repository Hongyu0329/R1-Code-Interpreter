    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid. The grid is a 20x20 matrix with a diagonal pattern of check marks (✅) and question marks (❔) that we need to fill in.\n\n### Observations:\n1. The grid has a diagonal pattern of check marks (✅) that seem to move from the bottom-left to the top-right.\n2. The position of the check marks in each row seems to follow a specific pattern.\n\n### Pattern Analysis:\n- The first row with a check mark is at position (0, 7).\n- The second row with a check mark is at position (1, 6).\n- The third row with a check mark is at position (2, 5).\n- This pattern continues, with the column index decreasing by 1 as the row index increases by 1.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe pattern is a diagonal line that starts from the bottom-left corner and moves to the top-right corner. The column index for the check mark in each row is given by the formula:\n\\[ \\text{column index} = 7 - \\text{row index} \\]\n\n### Filling the Grid:\nWe will fill the grid using this pattern and replace the question mark (❔) with a check mark (✅) at the appropriate position.\n\nLet's write a Python script to fill in the grid based on this pattern.\n\n```python\n# Initialize the grid with ❌\ngrid = [['❌' for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(20)]\n\n# Fill the grid based on the identified pattern\nfor row in range(20):\n    col = 7 - row\n    if 0 <= col < 20:\n        grid[row][col] = '✅'\n\n# Replace the question mark with the correct pattern\ngrid[19][3] = '✅'\n\n# Print the completed grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(''.join(row))\n```\n\nThis code will fill the grid according to the identified pattern and replace the question mark with the correct check mark. Let's execute this code to see the completed grid.",
    "The code output shows that the pattern was correctly identified and applied for the first few rows, but the rest of the grid was not filled correctly. This is because the pattern was only applied to the first 8 rows, and the rest of the grid was left unchanged.\n\nUpon reviewing the pattern, it seems that the diagonal pattern should continue throughout the grid, wrapping around when necessary. Let's adjust the code to correctly fill the entire grid by considering the wrapping pattern.\n\n### Revised Pattern Analysis:\n- The pattern is a diagonal line that starts from the bottom-left corner and moves to the top-right corner.\n- The column index for the check mark in each row is given by the formula:\n  \\[ \\text{column index} = (7 - \\text{row index}) \\mod 20 \\]\n\nLet's update the code to fill the grid correctly.\n\n```python\n# Initialize the grid with ❌\ngrid = [['❌' for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(20)]\n\n# Fill the grid based on the identified pattern\nfor row in range(20):\n    col = (7 - row) % 20\n    grid[row][col] = '✅'\n\n# Print the completed grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(''.join(row))\n```\n\nThis code will fill the grid according to the identified pattern, ensuring the diagonal pattern wraps around correctly. Let's execute this code to see the completed grid.",
    "The code output shows that the pattern was correctly applied for the first 8 rows and the last 12 rows, but the wrapping was not correctly implemented. The pattern should continue diagonally and wrap around the grid. Let's adjust the code to ensure the pattern wraps around correctly.\n\n### Revised Pattern Analysis:\n- The pattern is a diagonal line that starts from the bottom-left corner and moves to the top-right corner.\n- The column index for the check mark in each row is given by the formula:\n  \\[ \\text{column index} = (\\text{row index} + 7) \\mod 20 \\]\n\nLet's update the code to fill the grid correctly.\n\n```python\n# Initialize the grid with ❌\ngrid = [['❌' for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(20)]\n\n# Fill the grid based on the identified pattern\nfor row in range(20):\n    col = (row + 7) % 20\n    grid[row][col] = '✅'\n\n# Print the completed grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(''.join(row))\n```\n\nThis code will fill the grid according to the identified pattern, ensuring the diagonal pattern wraps around correctly.
