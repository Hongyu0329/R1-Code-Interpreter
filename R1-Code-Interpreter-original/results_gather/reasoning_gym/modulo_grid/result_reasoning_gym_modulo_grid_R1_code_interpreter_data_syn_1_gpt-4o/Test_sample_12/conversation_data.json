    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid. The grid is a 20x20 matrix filled with '❌' and '✅'. The pattern seems to be diagonal, with '✅' appearing in a diagonal line from the top left to the bottom right, and then repeating in a staggered manner.\n\nLet's analyze the pattern:\n\n1. The first row starts with '✅' at the first position, then every 11th position has a '✅'.\n2. The second row starts with '❌', then '✅' at the second position, and every 11th position after that.\n3. This pattern continues, with each subsequent row having the '✅' shifted one position to the right.\n\nThe pattern can be described as follows:\n- For a given row `i`, the '✅' appears at positions where `(j - i) % 11 == 0`.\n\nNow, let's fill in the grid using this pattern and replace the '?' with the correct value.\n\n```python\n# Define the size of the grid\nn = 20\n\n# Initialize the grid with '❌'\ngrid = [['❌' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Fill the grid based on the identified pattern\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if (j - i) % 11 == 0:\n            grid[i][j] = '✅'\n\n# Print the completed grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(''.join(row))\n```\n\nThis code will generate the completed grid based on the identified pattern. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code executed correctly and filled the grid based on the identified pattern. The pattern is a diagonal repetition of '✅' every 11 positions, starting from the top left corner and wrapping around the grid. The grid is now complete, and the '?' has been replaced with the correct value according to the pattern.\n\nHere is the completed grid:\n\n<<<\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n>>>"
