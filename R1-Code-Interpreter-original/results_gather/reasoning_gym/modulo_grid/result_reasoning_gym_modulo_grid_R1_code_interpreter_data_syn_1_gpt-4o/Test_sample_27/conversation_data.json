    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and fill in the question mark. The grid is 20x20, and we need to determine the positions of the checkmarks (✅) based on the given pattern.\n\n### Observations:\n1. The grid has a repeating pattern every 4 rows.\n2. In each row with checkmarks, they appear at the 4th, 11th, and 20th columns.\n3. The rows with checkmarks are the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th, and 20th rows.\n\n### Pattern:\n- Checkmarks appear in every even row.\n- In each of these rows, checkmarks are at the 4th, 11th, and 20th columns.\n\n### Task:\nWe need to fill in the question mark in the grid with a checkmark (✅) based on this pattern.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to generate the completed grid.\n\n```python\n# Initialize a 20x20 grid with ❌\ngrid = [['❌' for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(20)]\n\n# Fill in the checkmarks based on the identified pattern\nfor row in range(1, 20, 2):  # Every even row (1-indexed)\n    grid[row][3] = '✅'  # 4th column (0-indexed)\n    grid[row][10] = '✅'  # 11th column (0-indexed)\n    grid[row][19] = '✅'  # 20th column (0-indexed)\n\n# Convert the grid to a string representation\ncompleted_grid = '\\n'.join([''.join(row) for row in grid])\nprint(completed_grid)\n```\n\nThis code will generate the completed grid by filling in the checkmarks according to the identified pattern.
