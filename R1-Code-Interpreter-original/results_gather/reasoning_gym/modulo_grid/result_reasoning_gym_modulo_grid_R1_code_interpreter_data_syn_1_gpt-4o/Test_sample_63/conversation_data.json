    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and fill in the missing values. The grid is a 20x20 matrix, and we need to determine the positions of the ✅ symbols based on the given pattern.\n\n### Observations:\n1. The given grid has a diagonal pattern of ✅ symbols starting from the bottom-left corner and moving towards the top-right corner.\n2. The positions of the ✅ symbols in the last three rows are:\n   - Row 18, Column 1\n   - Row 19, Column 2\n   - Row 20, Column 3\n\n### Pattern Analysis:\n- The pattern seems to be a diagonal line where the row index and column index are related. Specifically, the column index is one less than the row index (considering 1-based indexing).\n- This means that for each row `i`, the column `j` where the ✅ appears is `j = i - 17` (since the first ✅ appears at row 18, column 1).\n\n### Filling the Grid:\n- We will fill the grid by placing a ✅ at positions where the column index is one less than the row index, starting from row 18 to row 20.\n- The rest of the grid will be filled with ❌.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to generate the completed grid.\n\n```python\n# Initialize a 20x20 grid with ❌\ngrid = [['❌' for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(20)]\n\n# Fill the grid with ✅ based on the identified pattern\nfor i in range(17, 20):  # Rows 18 to 20 (0-based index 17 to 19)\n    grid[i][i - 17] = '✅'\n\n# Print the completed grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(''.join(row))\n```\n\nThis code will generate the completed grid based on the identified pattern. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code executed correctly and filled the grid based on the identified pattern.
