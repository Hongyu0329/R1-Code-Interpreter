    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid. The grid is a 20x20 matrix, and we need to determine the position of the '✅' marks.\n\nObserving the grid, we can see that the '✅' marks form a diagonal pattern from the bottom-left to the top-right. The position of the '✅' in each row seems to be determined by a specific pattern.\n\nLet's analyze the positions of the '✅' marks:\n\n- Row 1: Column 11\n- Row 2: Column 12\n- Row 3: Column 13\n- ...\n- Row 8: Column 18\n- Row 9: Column 19\n- Row 10: Column 20\n- Row 11: Column 1\n- Row 12: Column 2\n- ...\n- Row 19: Column 9\n- Row 20: Column 10\n\nThe pattern is that the column index of the '✅' mark increases by 1 as we move down each row, and it wraps around after reaching the last column. This is a cyclic pattern with a period of 20.\n\nTo fill in the grid, we can use this pattern to determine the position of the '✅' mark in each row. Let's write a Python script to generate the completed grid.\n\n```python\n# Initialize a 20x20 grid with '❌'\ngrid = [['❌' for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(20)]\n\n# Fill in the '✅' marks according to the identified pattern\nfor row in range(20):\n    col = (row + 10) % 20  # Calculate the column index for '✅'\n    grid[row][col] = '✅'\n\n# Print the completed grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(''.join(row))\n```\n\nThis script initializes a 20x20 grid filled with '❌' and then places '✅' marks according to the identified pattern. The column index for each '✅' is calculated using `(row + 10) % 20`, which accounts for the cyclic nature of the pattern. Let's execute this code to get the completed grid.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matches the expected pattern. The '✅' marks form a diagonal line from the bottom-left to the top-right, wrapping around after reaching the last column. The pattern is consistent with the observed positions of the '✅' marks in the given grid.\n\nHere is the completed grid:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n>>>"
