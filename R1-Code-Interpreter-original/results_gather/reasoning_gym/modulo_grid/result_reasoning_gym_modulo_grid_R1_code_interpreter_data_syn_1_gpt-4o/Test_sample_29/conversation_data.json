    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid. The grid is a 20x20 matrix with some cells marked with a checkmark (✅) and others with a cross (❌). We need to determine the pattern that dictates the placement of the checkmarks and fill in the missing checkmark (currently represented by a question mark).\n\nUpon examining the grid, it appears that the checkmarks are placed diagonally. Specifically, the checkmarks seem to follow a pattern where they are placed in cells where the row index and column index are equal, i.e., on the main diagonal of the grid. This is a common pattern in matrices, where the main diagonal is defined by the condition that the row index equals the column index.\n\nLet's verify this pattern by checking the positions of the existing checkmarks:\n\n- Row 1, Column 7\n- Row 2, Column 8\n- Row 3, Column 9\n- Row 4, Column 10\n- Row 5, Column 11\n- Row 6, Column 12\n- Row 7, Column 1\n- Row 8, Column 2\n- Row 9, Column 3\n- Row 10, Column 4\n- Row 11, Column 5\n- Row 12, Column 6\n- Row 13, Column 7\n- Row 14, Column 8\n- Row 15, Column 9\n- Row 16, Column 10\n- Row 17, Column 11\n- Row 18, Column 12\n- Row 19, Column 13\n- Row 20, Column 14\n\nThe pattern is that the checkmarks are placed in a diagonal manner, but with a shift. The checkmark in each row is placed at a column that is 6 positions ahead of the row number, wrapping around when necessary. This means that for row `i`, the checkmark is placed at column `(i + 6) % 20`, where `%` is the modulo operator.\n\nNow, let's fill in the grid using this pattern and replace the question mark with the correct checkmark.\n\n```python\n# Initialize a 20x20 grid with all ❌\ngrid = [['❌' for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(20)]\n\n# Fill in the grid with the pattern\nfor i in range(20):\n    col = (i + 6) % 20\n    grid[i][col] = '✅'\n\n# Print the completed grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(''.join(row))\n```\n\nThe code will generate the completed grid based on the identified pattern. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and produced the completed grid based on the identified pattern. The pattern involves placing a checkmark (✅) in each row at a column that is 6 positions ahead of the row number, wrapping around when necessary. This pattern was applied to fill in the entire grid, including the position where the question mark was located.\n\nHere is the completed grid:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅  \n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n>>>"
