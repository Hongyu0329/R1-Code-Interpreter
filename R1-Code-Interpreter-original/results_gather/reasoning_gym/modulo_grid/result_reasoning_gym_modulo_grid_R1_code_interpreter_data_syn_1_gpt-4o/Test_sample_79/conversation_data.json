    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid. The grid is a 20x20 matrix with a single '✅' in each row and column, except for one row where there is a '❔'. The task is to determine the position of the '✅' in the row with the '❔'.\n\nLet's analyze the pattern:\n\n1. The first row has a '✅' at the 7th position.\n2. The second row has a '✅' at the 8th position.\n3. The third row has a '✅' at the 9th position.\n4. This pattern continues, with each subsequent row having the '✅' one position to the right of the previous row.\n\nThis suggests a diagonal pattern where the position of the '✅' in the nth row is at the (n+6)th column. \n\nNow, let's apply this pattern to the row with the '❔':\n\n- The 14th row should have a '✅' at the (14+6)th position, which is the 20th position.\n\nLet's fill in the grid using this pattern and return the completed grid.\n\n```python\n# Initialize a 20x20 grid with '❌'\ngrid = [['❌' for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(20)]\n\n# Fill the grid according to the identified pattern\nfor i in range(20):\n    if i == 13:\n        # The row with the '❔' should have a '✅' at the 20th position\n        grid[i][19] = '✅'\n    else:\n        # Place '✅' at the (i+6)th position\n        grid[i][i+6] = '✅'\n\n# Print the completed grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(''.join(row))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the solution.",
    "The error indicates that the index is out of range. This happens because the pattern `(i+6)` exceeds the grid's boundaries when `i` is 14 or greater. Let's adjust the pattern to wrap around the grid using modulo arithmetic.\n\nThe correct pattern should be `(i + 6) % 20` to ensure the index stays within the bounds of the grid. Let's correct the code and try again.\n\n```python\n# Initialize a 20x20 grid with '❌'\ngrid = [['❌' for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(20)]\n\n# Fill the grid according to the identified pattern\nfor i in range(20):\n    # Place '✅' at the (i+6) % 20 position\n    grid[i][(i + 6) % 20] = '✅'\n\n# Print the completed grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(''.join(row))\n```\n\nLet's execute this corrected code to verify the solution.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the grid has been filled according to the identified pattern.
