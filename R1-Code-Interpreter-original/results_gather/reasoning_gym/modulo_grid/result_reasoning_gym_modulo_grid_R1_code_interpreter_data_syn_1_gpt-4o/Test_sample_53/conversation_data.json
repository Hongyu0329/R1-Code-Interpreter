    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid. The grid is a 20x20 matrix with '❌' and '✅' symbols. The '✅' symbols appear to follow a diagonal pattern. Let's analyze the positions of the '✅' symbols:\n\n1. In the first row, the '✅' is at the 8th position.\n2. In the second row, the '✅' is at the 9th position.\n3. In the third row, the '✅' is at the 10th position.\n4. This pattern continues, with each subsequent row having the '✅' one position to the right.\n\nThe pattern suggests that the '✅' symbol moves one position to the right in each subsequent row. This pattern continues until the 14th row, where the '✅' is at the 21st position, which is out of bounds for a 20x20 grid. Therefore, the pattern seems to reset, starting again from the first column.\n\nLet's verify this by checking the positions of the '✅' symbols in the subsequent rows:\n\n- In the 15th row, the '✅' should be at the 1st position.\n- In the 16th row, the '✅' should be at the 2nd position.\n- This pattern continues, with each subsequent row having the '✅' one position to the right.\n\nNow, let's fill in the grid using this pattern and replace the '?' with the correct symbol.\n\n```python\n# Define the grid size\ngrid_size = 20\n\n# Initialize the grid with '❌'\ngrid = [['❌' for _ in range(grid_size)] for _ in range(grid_size)]\n\n# Fill the grid with '✅' following the identified pattern\nfor i in range(grid_size):\n    position = (i + 7) % grid_size  # Calculate the position of '✅' in each row\n    grid[i][position] = '✅'\n\n# Print the completed grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(''.join(row))\n```\n\nThe code will fill the grid according to the identified pattern and print the completed grid. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed correctly and filled the grid according to the identified pattern. The pattern involves placing a '✅' in each row, starting from the 8th column in the first row and moving one column to the right in each subsequent row. When the end of the row is reached, the pattern wraps around to the beginning of the next row.\n\nThe completed grid is as follows:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅  \n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n>>>"
