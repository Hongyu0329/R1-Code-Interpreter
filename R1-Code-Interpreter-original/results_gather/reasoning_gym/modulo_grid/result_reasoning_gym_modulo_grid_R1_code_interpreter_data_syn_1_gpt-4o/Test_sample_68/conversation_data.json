    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid. The grid is a 20x20 matrix with some cells marked with a \"✅\" and others with a \"❌\". The task is to identify the pattern and fill in the missing \"?\" with either \"✅\" or \"❌\".\n\n### Observations:\n1. The \"✅\" marks seem to form a diagonal pattern from the bottom-left to the top-right of the grid.\n2. The position of the \"✅\" marks appears to follow a linear pattern where the row index and column index sum to a constant value.\n\n### Pattern Identification:\n- Let's denote the grid as a 20x20 matrix with indices ranging from 0 to 19.\n- The \"✅\" marks are located at positions where the sum of the row index and column index equals 19. This is because the first \"✅\" is at (0, 19), the second at (1, 18), and so on, until the last \"✅\" at (19, 0).\n\n### Filling the Grid:\n- We need to fill the grid such that any cell (i, j) where i + j = 19 is marked with a \"✅\".\n- The rest of the cells will remain \"❌\".\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to fill the grid and replace the \"?\" with the correct symbol.\n\n```python\n# Initialize a 20x20 grid with \"❌\"\ngrid = [[\"❌\" for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(20)]\n\n# Fill the grid with \"✅\" where the sum of indices equals 19\nfor i in range(20):\n    for j in range(20):\n        if i + j == 19:\n            grid[i][j] = \"✅\"\n\n# Print the completed grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(\"\".join(row))\n```\n\nThis code will generate the completed grid by filling in the \"?\" with the correct pattern. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code executed correctly and filled the grid based on the identified pattern. The pattern is that the \"✅\" marks are placed where the sum of the row index and column index equals 19. This pattern was applied to fill the entire grid, including the position of the \"?\".\n\nHere is the completed grid:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n>>>"
