    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and fill in the missing value represented by the question mark. The grid is a 20x20 matrix with a diagonal pattern of check marks (✅) moving from the bottom-left to the top-right.\n\nLet's analyze the pattern:\n\n1. The first row with a check mark is the 1st row, 11th column.\n2. The second row with a check mark is the 2nd row, 10th column.\n3. The third row with a check mark is the 3rd row, 9th column.\n4. This pattern continues, with the check mark moving one column to the left and one row down each time.\n\nThe pattern is a diagonal line from the bottom-left to the top-right, with the check mark moving one step diagonally each time.\n\nNow, let's determine the position of the missing check mark (❔):\n\n- The missing check mark is in the 5th row.\n- Following the pattern, the check mark in the 5th row should be in the 7th column.\n\nLet's fill in the grid with this information and return the completed grid.\n\n```python\n# Define the grid size\ngrid_size = 20\n\n# Initialize the grid with ❌\ngrid = [['❌' for _ in range(grid_size)] for _ in range(grid_size)]\n\n# Fill in the check marks (✅) following the identified pattern\nfor i in range(grid_size):\n    grid[i][grid_size - i - 1] = '✅'\n\n# Fill in the missing check mark (❔) in the 5th row, 7th column\ngrid[4][6] = '✅'\n\n# Print the completed grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(''.join(row))\n```\n\nThe code will generate the completed grid, and we will use the output to provide the final answer.",
