    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and fill in the question marks accordingly. The grid is a 20x20 matrix, and we have a single known value, which is a check mark (✅) at position (1, 10) (considering 0-based indexing).\n\nThe question mark is located at position (12, 0). We need to determine the pattern that connects these two positions.\n\n### Analyzing the Pattern\n\n1. **Position of the Known Value**: The known value is at (1, 10).\n2. **Position of the Question Mark**: The question mark is at (12, 0).\n\nGiven the sparse information, one possible pattern could be a diagonal or some form of linear progression. Since the grid is large and we have only one known value, let's assume a simple diagonal pattern for now.\n\n### Hypothesis\n\nAssume a diagonal pattern where the check mark moves diagonally downwards to the right. This would mean that for every step down (increase in row index), the column index also increases by the same amount.\n\n### Testing the Hypothesis\n\nTo test this hypothesis, we can write a simple Python script to fill in the grid based on this diagonal pattern. If the pattern holds, the check mark should appear at the position of the question mark.\n\n```python\n# Initialize a 20x20 grid with '❌'\ngrid = [['❌' for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(20)]\n\n# Place the known check mark\ngrid[1][10] = '✅'\n\n# Fill the grid based on the diagonal pattern hypothesis\nfor i in range(20):\n    if 0 <= i + 9 < 20:  # Ensure we stay within bounds\n        grid[i][i + 9] = '✅'\n\n# Print the grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(''.join(row))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to see if the pattern holds and fills the question mark correctly.",
    "The output of the code shows a diagonal pattern starting from the known check mark at position (1, 10) and moving downwards to the right. However, the pattern does not reach the position of the question mark at (12, 0). This indicates that the initial hypothesis of a simple diagonal pattern is incorrect.\n\n### Re-evaluating the Pattern\n\nGiven the position of the known check mark and the question mark, let's consider a different approach. The question mark is at (12, 0), which suggests a different kind of pattern, possibly involving a wrap-around or a different starting point.\n\n### New Hypothesis\n\nLet's consider a pattern where the check mark moves vertically downwards from the starting point (1, 10) and wraps around to the beginning of the next row when it reaches the end of a row. This would mean that the check mark moves in a straight line downwards, and when it reaches the bottom, it continues from the top of the next column.\n\n### Testing the New Hypothesis\n\nWe will write a new Python script to test this hypothesis by filling the grid with this vertical pattern.\n\n```python\n# Initialize a 20x20 grid with '❌'\ngrid = [['❌' for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(20)]\n\n# Place the known check mark\ngrid[1][10] = '✅'\n\n# Fill the grid based on the vertical pattern hypothesis\nfor i in range(20):\n    grid[(1 + i) % 20][10] = '✅'\n\n# Print the grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(''.join(row))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to see if the pattern fills the question mark correctly.",

The question mark is at (12, 0), which suggests a different kind of pattern, possibly involving a wrap-around or a different starting point.\n\n### New Hypothesis\n\nLet's consider a pattern where the check mark moves horizontally across the row from the starting point (1, 10) and wraps around to the beginning of the next row when it reaches the end of a row. This would mean that the check mark moves in a straight line horizontally, and when it reaches the end, it continues from the start of the next row.\n\n### Testing the New Hypothesis\n\nWe will write a new Python script to test this hypothesis by filling the grid with this horizontal pattern.\n\n```python\n# Initialize a 20x20 grid with '❌'\ngrid = [['❌' for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(20)]\n\n# Place the known check mark\ngrid[1][10] = '✅'\n\n# Fill the grid based on the horizontal pattern hypothesis\nfor i in range(20):\n    grid[1][(10 + i) % 20] = '✅'\n\n# Print the grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(''.join(row))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to see if the pattern fills the question mark correctly.",
