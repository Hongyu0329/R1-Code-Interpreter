    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid. The grid is a 20x20 matrix, and we need to determine the position of the '✅' symbols. \n\nUpon examining the grid, we can observe that the '✅' symbols form a diagonal pattern. Specifically, the '✅' symbols appear to be placed in a manner where they move one step down and one step to the right in each subsequent row. This suggests that the '✅' symbols are placed at positions where the row index equals the column index.\n\nLet's verify this pattern with the given grid:\n\n- In the first row, the '✅' is at the 10th column (index 9).\n- In the second row, the '✅' is at the 11th column (index 10).\n- In the third row, the '✅' is at the 12th column (index 11).\n- This pattern continues, with the '✅' moving one column to the right in each subsequent row.\n\nThe pattern can be described as follows: for a given row `i`, the '✅' is placed at column `(i + 9) % 20`. This accounts for the wrap-around effect when the index exceeds the grid size.\n\nNow, let's fill in the grid using this pattern and replace the '?' with the correct symbol.\n\n```python\n# Initialize a 20x20 grid with '❌'\ngrid = [['❌' for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(20)]\n\n# Fill the grid with '✅' based on the identified pattern\nfor i in range(20):\n    grid[i][(i + 9) % 20] = '✅'\n\n# Print the completed grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(''.join(row))\n```\n\nThis code will fill the grid according to the identified pattern and print the completed grid. Let's execute this code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matches the expected pattern. The grid is filled according to the identified pattern, where the '✅' symbols form a diagonal line that wraps around the grid. The '?' has been replaced with the correct symbol based on this pattern.\n\nHere is the completed grid:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n>>>"
