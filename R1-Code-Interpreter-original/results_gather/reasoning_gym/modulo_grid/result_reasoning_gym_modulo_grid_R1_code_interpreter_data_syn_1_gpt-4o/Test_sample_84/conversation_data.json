    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern that determines the placement of the ✅ symbols in the grid. Let's analyze the given grid:\n\n1. The grid is 20x20 in size.\n2. The positions of the ✅ symbols are as follows:\n   - Row 2, Column 19\n   - Row 3, Column 10 and 20\n   - Row 4, Column 7\n   - Row 7, Column 4 and 13\n   - Row 8, Column 15\n   - Row 10, Column 3\n   - Row 12, Column 19\n   - Row 14, Column 7\n   - Row 15, Column 8 and 18\n   - Row 18, Column 15\n   - Row 19, Column 2 and 11\n   - Row 20, Column 3\n\nBy examining these positions, we can try to identify a mathematical pattern or sequence that determines the placement of the ✅ symbols. \n\nOne possible approach is to look for a pattern in the differences between the row and column indices of the ✅ symbols. Let's calculate these differences:\n\n- Row 2, Column 19: Difference = 19 - 2 = 17\n- Row 3, Column 10: Difference = 10 - 3 = 7\n- Row 3, Column 20: Difference = 20 - 3 = 17\n- Row 4, Column 7: Difference = 7 - 4 = 3\n- Row 7, Column 4: Difference = 4 - 7 = -3\n- Row 7, Column 13: Difference = 13 - 7 = 6\n- Row 8, Column 15: Difference = 15 - 8 = 7\n- Row 10, Column 3: Difference = 3 - 10 = -7\n- Row 12, Column 19: Difference = 19 - 12 = 7\n- Row 14, Column 7: Difference = 7 - 14 = -7\n- Row 15, Column 8: Difference = 8 - 15 = -7\n- Row 15, Column 18: Difference = 18 - 15 = 3\n- Row 18, Column 15: Difference = 15 - 18 = -3\n- Row 19, Column 2: Difference = 2 - 19 = -17\n- Row 19, Column 11: Difference = 11 - 19 = -8\n- Row 20, Column 3: Difference = 3 - 20 = -17\n\nFrom these differences, we can see that the differences are either 17, 7, 3, -3, -7, or -17. This suggests that the pattern might involve a sequence of differences that repeat or follow a specific rule.\n\nLet's try to identify the pattern by writing a Python script to check for a repeating sequence of differences and fill in the missing ✅ symbols in the grid.\n\n```python\n# Initialize the grid with ❌\ngrid = [['❌' for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(20)]\n\n# List of given positions of ✅\npositions = [\n    (1, 18), (2, 9), (2, 19), (3, 6), (6, 3), (6, 12), (7, 14),\n    (9, 2), (11, 18), (13, 6), (14, 7), (14, 17), (17, 14), (18, 1),\n    (18, 10), (19, 2)\n]\n\n# Fill the given positions with ✅\nfor r, c in positions:\n    grid[r][c] = '✅'\n\n# Define the pattern of differences\ndifferences = [17, 7, 3, -3, -7, -17]\n\n# Fill the grid based on the pattern\nfor r in range(20):\n    for diff in differences:\n        c = r + diff\n        if 0 <= c < 20:\n            grid[r][c] = '✅'\n\n# Print the completed grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(''.join(row))\n```\n\nThis script will fill in the grid based on the identified pattern of differences. Let's execute the code to see the completed grid.",
    "The code executed successfully and filled in the grid based on the identified pattern of differences. The pattern was determined by the differences between the row and column indices of the given ✅ symbols.
