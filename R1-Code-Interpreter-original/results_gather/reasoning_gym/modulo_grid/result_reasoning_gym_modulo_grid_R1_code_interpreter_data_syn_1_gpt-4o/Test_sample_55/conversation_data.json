    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid. The grid is 20x20, and we have a mix of '❌' and '✅' symbols, with one '?' symbol that we need to replace with either '❌' or '✅'.\n\nLet's analyze the positions of the '✅' symbols:\n\n1. (1, 3)\n2. (3, 1), (3, 7), (3, 13), (3, 19)\n3. (5, 15)\n4. (7, 3)\n5. (11, 15)\n6. (13, 3)\n7. (15, 5), (15, 11), (15, 17)\n8. (17, 15)\n9. (19, 3)\n\nFrom this, we can see that the '✅' symbols appear to be following a pattern. Let's try to identify the pattern:\n\n- The '✅' symbols seem to appear in a repeating pattern every 6 rows, starting from row 3.\n- Within each group of 6 rows, the '✅' symbols appear at specific columns: 3, 7, 13, 19, 15, 3, 15, 3, 5, 11, 17, 15, 3.\n\nNow, let's check the position of the '?' symbol:\n\n- The '?' is located at (0, 8).\n\nTo determine whether the '?' should be '❌' or '✅', we need to see if it fits into the pattern we identified. Since the pattern repeats every 6 rows, and the '?' is in the first row, it does not fit into the pattern of '✅' symbols. Therefore, the '?' should be replaced with '❌'.\n\nLet's generate the completed grid:\n\n```python\n# Define the grid size\ngrid_size = 20\n\n# Initialize the grid with '❌'\ngrid = [['❌' for _ in range(grid_size)] for _ in range(grid_size)]\n\n# Define the positions of '✅' based on the identified pattern\npositions = [\n    (1, 3),\n    (3, 1), (3, 7), (3, 13), (3, 19),\n    (5, 15),\n    (7, 3),\n    (11, 15),\n    (13, 3),\n    (15, 5), (15, 11), (15, 17),\n    (17, 15),\n    (19, 3)\n]\n\n# Place '✅' in the grid\nfor x, y in positions:\n    grid[x][y] = '✅'\n\n# Convert the grid to a string for display\ngrid_str = '\\n'.join(''.join(row) for row in grid)\nprint(grid_str)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the completed grid.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matches the expected pattern. The '?' was correctly replaced with '❌' based on the identified pattern.
