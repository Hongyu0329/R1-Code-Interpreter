    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and fill in the missing question mark. The grid is a 20x20 matrix with some cells marked with a checkmark (✅) and others with a cross (❌). \n\nLet's analyze the positions of the checkmarks:\n\n1. The checkmarks are located at the following coordinates (row, column):\n   - (0, 9)\n   - (3, 3)\n   - (3, 19)\n   - (5, 5)\n   - (7, 15) (This is the position of the question mark)\n   - (9, 1)\n   - (9, 17)\n   - (11, 11)\n   - (13, 13)\n   - (15, 7)\n   - (17, 9)\n   - (19, 3)\n   - (19, 19)\n\n2. Observing these positions, it seems like there is a pattern based on the sum of the row and column indices. Let's calculate the sum of the indices for each checkmark:\n\n   - (0, 9) -> 0 + 9 = 9\n   - (3, 3) -> 3 + 3 = 6\n   - (3, 19) -> 3 + 19 = 22\n   - (5, 5) -> 5 + 5 = 10\n   - (7, 15) -> 7 + 15 = 22\n   - (9, 1) -> 9 + 1 = 10\n   - (9, 17) -> 9 + 17 = 26\n   - (11, 11) -> 11 + 11 = 22\n   - (13, 13) -> 13 + 13 = 26\n   - (15, 7) -> 15 + 7 = 22\n   - (17, 9) -> 17 + 9 = 26\n   - (19, 3) -> 19 + 3 = 22\n   - (19, 19) -> 19 + 19 = 38\n\n3. The pattern seems to be that the sum of the row and column indices is either 22 or 26, except for the last checkmark at (19, 19) which sums to 38. \n\n4. The question mark is at position (7, 15), which sums to 22. This matches the pattern of having a checkmark.\n\nTherefore, the question mark should be replaced with a checkmark. Let's fill in the grid accordingly.\n\n```python\n# Define the grid size\ngrid_size = 20\n\n# Initialize the grid with crosses\ngrid = [['❌' for _ in range(grid_size)] for _ in range(grid_size)]\n\n# Define the positions of the checkmarks\ncheckmark_positions = [\n    (0, 9), (3, 3), (3, 19), (5, 5), (7, 15), (9, 1), (9, 17),\n    (11, 11), (13, 13), (15, 7), (17, 9), (19, 3), (19, 19)\n]\n\n# Place the checkmarks in the grid\nfor row, col in checkmark_positions:\n    grid[row][col] = '✅'\n\n# Print the completed grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(''.join(row))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to see the completed grid.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the grid has been completed with the checkmark at the position of the question mark. The pattern was identified based on the sum of the row and column indices, and the grid was filled accordingly.\n\nHere is the completed grid:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌  \n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅  \n>>>"
