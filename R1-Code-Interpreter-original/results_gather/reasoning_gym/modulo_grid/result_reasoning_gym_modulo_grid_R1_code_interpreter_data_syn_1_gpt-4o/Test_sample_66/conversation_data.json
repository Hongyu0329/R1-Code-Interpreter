    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid. The grid is a 20x20 matrix, and we need to determine the positions of the '✅' symbols based on the given pattern.\n\nUpon examining the grid, it appears that the '✅' symbols are placed in a diagonal pattern from the bottom-left to the top-right. Specifically, the '✅' symbols are placed such that they form a diagonal line with a slope of -1, starting from the bottom-left corner of the grid.\n\nThe pattern can be described as follows:\n- The first '✅' is at position (19, 0).\n- The second '✅' is at position (18, 1).\n- The third '✅' is at position (17, 2).\n- This pattern continues, with the row index decreasing by 1 and the column index increasing by 1 for each subsequent '✅'.\n\nGiven this pattern, we can fill in the missing '✅' symbols in the grid. Let's write a Python script to generate the completed grid based on this pattern.\n\n```python\n# Initialize a 20x20 grid with '❌'\ngrid = [['❌' for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(20)]\n\n# Fill in the '✅' symbols based on the identified pattern\nfor i in range(20):\n    grid[19 - i][i] = '✅'\n\n# Print the completed grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(''.join(row))\n```\n\nThis script initializes a 20x20 grid filled with '❌' and then places '✅' symbols according to the identified diagonal pattern. The completed grid is then printed row by row.",
    "The code output matches the expected pattern, where the '✅' symbols form a diagonal line from the bottom-left to the top-right of the grid. This confirms that the pattern was correctly identified and applied to fill in the grid.\n\nNow, I will provide the completed grid as the final answer.\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n>>>"
