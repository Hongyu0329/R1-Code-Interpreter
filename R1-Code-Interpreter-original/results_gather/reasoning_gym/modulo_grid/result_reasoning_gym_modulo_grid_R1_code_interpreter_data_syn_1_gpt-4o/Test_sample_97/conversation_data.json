    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and fill in the missing question mark. The grid is a 20x20 matrix with a diagonal pattern of check marks (✅) and crosses (❌). The check marks seem to follow a specific diagonal pattern.\n\nLet's analyze the positions of the check marks:\n\n- The first check mark is at position (1, 17).\n- The second check mark is at position (2, 18).\n- The third check mark is at position (3, 12).\n- The fourth check mark is at position (4, 9).\n- The fifth check mark is at position (5, 4).\n- The sixth check mark is at position (6, 11).\n- The seventh check mark is at position (7, 6).\n- The eighth check mark is at position (8, 16).\n- The ninth check mark is at position (9, 14).\n- The tenth check mark is at position (10, 5).\n- The eleventh check mark is at position (11, 15).\n- The twelfth check mark is at position (12, 2).\n- The thirteenth check mark is at position (13, 3).\n- The fourteenth check mark is at position (14, 13).\n- The fifteenth check mark is at position (15, 10).\n- The sixteenth check mark is at position (16, 7).\n- The seventeenth check mark is at position (17, 1).\n- The eighteenth check mark is at position (18, 8).\n- The nineteenth check mark is at position (19, 19).\n\nThe pattern seems to be a permutation of numbers from 1 to 19, with each number appearing once in the sequence. The missing check mark is at position (20, ?).\n\nTo find the missing number, we need to identify which number from 1 to 20 is missing in the sequence of check mark positions. Let's write a Python script to find the missing number.\n\n```python\n# List of column positions of check marks\npositions = [17, 18, 12, 9, 4, 11, 6, 16, 14, 5, 15, 2, 3, 13, 10, 7, 1, 8, 19]\n\n# Find the missing number in the sequence from 1 to 20\nmissing_number = set(range(1, 21)) - set(positions)\nprint(missing_number)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the missing number.",
    "The code output indicates that the missing number in the sequence is 20. This means the missing check mark should be placed at position (20, 20) in the grid.\n\nNow, let's fill in the grid with this information and provide the completed grid as the final answer.\n\n```\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❔❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n```\n\nThe completed grid with the missing check mark filled in is:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌✅\n>>>"
