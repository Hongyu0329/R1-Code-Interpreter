    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and fill in the missing value represented by the question mark. The grid is 20x20, and we need to determine the positions of the check marks (✅) based on the pattern.\n\n### Observations:\n1. The check marks appear to be placed in a repeating pattern.\n2. The pattern seems to involve a diagonal placement of check marks.\n3. The check marks appear at regular intervals both horizontally and vertically.\n\n### Pattern Analysis:\n- The check marks appear in a diagonal pattern, with a consistent spacing between them.\n- The pattern repeats every 5 rows and 5 columns.\n\n### Hypothesis:\nThe check marks are placed in a pattern where they appear at positions that satisfy the condition `(row_index % 5 == column_index % 5)`. This means that for every 5 rows and columns, the check mark appears in a diagonal line.\n\n### Filling the Grid:\nTo fill in the grid, we will iterate over each cell and place a check mark if the condition `(row_index % 5 == column_index % 5)` is satisfied.\n\nLet's write a Python script to fill in the grid based on this pattern and replace the question mark with the correct symbol.\n\n```python\n# Initialize a 20x20 grid with ❌\ngrid = [['❌' for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(20)]\n\n# Fill the grid based on the identified pattern\nfor row in range(20):\n    for col in range(20):\n        if row % 5 == col % 5:\n            grid[row][col] = '✅'\n\n# Print the grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(''.join(row))\n```\n\nThis script will fill the grid according to the identified pattern and print the completed grid.",
