    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the grid and fill in the missing question mark. Let's analyze the grid:\n\n1. The grid is 20x20, and we have some cells marked with \"✅\".\n2. Observing the positions of \"✅\", we can see a repeating pattern:\n   - In rows 1, 7, 13, and 19, \"✅\" appears at columns 4, 10, and 16.\n   - In rows 5, 11, and 17, \"✅\" appears at columns 6, 12, and 18.\n\nThe pattern seems to be that \"✅\" appears in every 6th row starting from row 1 and 5, and within those rows, it appears every 6th column starting from column 4 and 6, respectively.\n\nNow, let's fill in the missing \"?\" in the grid. The \"?\" is located at row 19, column 18. According to the pattern, in row 19, \"✅\" should appear at columns 4, 10, and 16. Therefore, the \"?\" should be replaced with \"❌\".\n\nLet's generate the completed grid using this pattern:\n\n```python\n# Initialize a 20x20 grid with \"❌\"\ngrid = [['❌' for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(20)]\n\n# Fill in the \"✅\" according to the identified pattern\nfor row in range(0, 20, 6):\n    for col in range(3, 20, 6):\n        grid[row][col] = '✅'\n\nfor row in range(5, 20, 6):\n    for col in range(5, 20, 6):\n        grid[row][col] = '✅'\n\n# Convert the grid to a string format\ncompleted_grid = '\\n'.join([''.join(row) for row in grid])\nprint(completed_grid)\n```\n\nThis code will generate the completed grid based on the identified pattern. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code output shows the completed grid based on the identified pattern. The pattern was correctly applied, and the grid was filled accordingly. The missing \"?\" was replaced with \"❌\" as expected.\n\nHere is the completed grid:\n\n<<<\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌\n❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌❌✅❌❌❌❌\n❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌\n>>>"
