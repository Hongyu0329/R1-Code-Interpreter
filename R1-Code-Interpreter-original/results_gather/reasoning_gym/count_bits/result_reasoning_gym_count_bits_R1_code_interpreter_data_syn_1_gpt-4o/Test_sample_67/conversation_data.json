    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 867536309, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert the number 867536309 to its binary representation.\n2. Count the number of 1s in this binary representation.\n\nLet's proceed with the Python code to perform these steps:\n\n```python\n# Convert the number to binary and count the number of 1s\nnumber = 867536309\nbinary_representation = bin(number)\ncount_of_ones = binary_representation.count('1')\n\n# Output the result\nprint(count_of_ones)\n```\n\nThis code will convert the number to its binary form and count the number of 1s in that binary string. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the output, which indicates that there are 18 '1' bits in the binary representation of the number 867536309.\n\n<<<18>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    How many 1 bits are there in the binary representation of the number 867536309?\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>.",
