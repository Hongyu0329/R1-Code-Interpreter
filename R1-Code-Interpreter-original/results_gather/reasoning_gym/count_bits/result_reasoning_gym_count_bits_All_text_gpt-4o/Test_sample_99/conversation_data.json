    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 677391918, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - The first step is to convert the decimal number 677391918 into its binary form. This involves dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder, then continuing with the quotient until the quotient is 0. The binary representation is the sequence of remainders read from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 677391918 and divide by 2:\n     - 677391918 ÷ 2 = 338695959 remainder 0\n     - 338695959 ÷ 2 = 169347979 remainder 1\n     - 169347979 ÷ 2 = 84673989 remainder 1\n     - 84673989 ÷ 2 = 42336994 remainder 1\n     - 42336994 ÷ 2 = 21168497 remainder 0\n     - 21168497 ÷ 2 = 10584248 remainder 1\n     - 10584248 ÷ 2 = 5292124 remainder 0\n     - 5292124 ÷ 2 = 2646062 remainder 0\n     - 2646062 ÷ 2 = 1323031 remainder 0\n     - 1323031 ÷ 2 = 661515 remainder 1\n     - 661515 ÷ 2 = 330757 remainder 1\n     - 330757 ÷ 2 = 165378 remainder 1\n     - 165378 ÷ 2 = 82689 remainder 0\n     - 82689 ÷ 2 = 41344 remainder 1\n     - 41344 ÷ 2 = 20672 remainder 0\n     - 20672 ÷ 2 = 10336 remainder 0\n     - 10336 ÷ 2 = 5168 remainder 0\n     - 5168 ÷ 2 = 2584 remainder 0\n     - 2584 ÷ 2 = 1292 remainder 0\n     - 1292 ÷ 2 = 646 remainder 0\n     - 646 ÷ 2 = 323 remainder 0\n     - 323 ÷ 2 = 161 remainder 1\n     - 161 ÷ 2 = 80 remainder 1\n     - 80 ÷ 2 = 40 remainder 0\n     - 40 ÷ 2 = 20 remainder 0\n     - 20 ÷ 2 = 10 remainder 0\n     - 10 ÷ 2 = 5 remainder 0\n     - 5 ÷ 2 = 2 remainder 1\n     - 2 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 0\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 677391918 is: \n     101000011110111111101111111110\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, count the number of 1s in the binary representation:\n     - 101000011110111111101111111110\n     - Count the 1s: There are 21 ones in this binary number.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 677391918 is 21.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<21>>>"
