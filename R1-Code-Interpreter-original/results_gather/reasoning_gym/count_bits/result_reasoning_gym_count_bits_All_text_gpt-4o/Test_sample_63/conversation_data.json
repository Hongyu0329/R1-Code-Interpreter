    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 1632434348, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, convert the decimal number 1632434348 into its binary form. This can be done by repeatedly dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder. The binary representation is constructed by reading the remainders from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Binary Conversion Process:**\n   - Start with the number 1632434348.\n   - Divide by 2, record the remainder, and use the quotient for the next division.\n   - Continue this process until the quotient is 0.\n   - The binary representation is the sequence of remainders read in reverse order.\n\n3. **Count the 1 Bits:**\n   - Once the binary representation is obtained, count the number of 1s in the sequence. This is done by simply iterating through the binary digits and counting each occurrence of the digit '1'.\n\n4. **Verification:**\n   - Double-check the binary conversion and the count of 1s to ensure accuracy.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n- **Binary Conversion:**\n  - 1632434348 in binary is `1100001101011111101111011110100`.\n\n- **Count the 1 Bits:**\n  - In the binary representation `1100001101011111101111011110100`, count the number of 1s.\n  - The binary string has 18 ones.\n\nTherefore, the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 1632434348 is 18.\n\n<<<18>>>"
