    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 600899156, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, convert the decimal number 600899156 into its binary form. This can be done by repeatedly dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder. The binary representation is constructed by reading the remainders from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 600899156 and divide by 2:\n     - 600899156 ÷ 2 = 300449578 remainder 0\n     - 300449578 ÷ 2 = 150224789 remainder 0\n     - 150224789 ÷ 2 = 75112394 remainder 1\n     - 75112394 ÷ 2 = 37556197 remainder 0\n     - 37556197 ÷ 2 = 18778098 remainder 1\n     - 18778098 ÷ 2 = 9389049 remainder 0\n     - 9389049 ÷ 2 = 4694524 remainder 1\n     - 4694524 ÷ 2 = 2347262 remainder 0\n     - 2347262 ÷ 2 = 1173631 remainder 0\n     - 1173631 ÷ 2 = 586815 remainder 1\n     - 586815 ÷ 2 = 293407 remainder 1\n     - 293407 ÷ 2 = 146703 remainder 1\n     - 146703 ÷ 2 = 73351 remainder 1\n     - 73351 ÷ 2 = 36675 remainder 1\n     - 36675 ÷ 2 = 18337 remainder 1\n     - 18337 ÷ 2 = 9168 remainder 1\n     - 9168 ÷ 2 = 4584 remainder 0\n     - 4584 ÷ 2 = 2292 remainder 0\n     - 2292 ÷ 2 = 1146 remainder 0\n     - 1146 ÷ 2 = 573 remainder 0\n     - 573 ÷ 2 = 286 remainder 1\n     - 286 ÷ 2 = 143 remainder 0\n     - 143 ÷ 2 = 71 remainder 1\n     - 71 ÷ 2 = 35 remainder 1\n     - 35 ÷ 2 = 17 remainder 1\n     - 17 ÷ 2 = 8 remainder 1\n     - 8 ÷ 2 = 4 remainder 0\n     - 4 ÷ 2 = 2 remainder 0\n     - 2 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 0\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 600899156 is: \n     100011111111111111111111110100\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, count the number of 1s in the binary representation:\n     - The binary number is: 100011111111111111111111110100\n     - Count the 1s: There are 26 ones in this binary representation.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 600899156 is 26.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<26>>>"
