    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 1248014695, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, convert the decimal number 1248014695 into its binary form. This can be done by repeatedly dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder. The binary representation is constructed by reading the remainders from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 1248014695 and divide by 2:\n     - 1248014695 ÷ 2 = 624007347 remainder 1\n     - 624007347 ÷ 2 = 312003673 remainder 1\n     - 312003673 ÷ 2 = 156001836 remainder 1\n     - 156001836 ÷ 2 = 78000918 remainder 0\n     - 78000918 ÷ 2 = 39000459 remainder 0\n     - 39000459 ÷ 2 = 19500229 remainder 1\n     - 19500229 ÷ 2 = 9750114 remainder 1\n     - 9750114 ÷ 2 = 4875057 remainder 0\n     - 4875057 ÷ 2 = 2437528 remainder 1\n     - 2437528 ÷ 2 = 1218764 remainder 0\n     - 1218764 ÷ 2 = 609382 remainder 0\n     - 609382 ÷ 2 = 304691 remainder 0\n     - 304691 ÷ 2 = 152345 remainder 1\n     - 152345 ÷ 2 = 76172 remainder 1\n     - 76172 ÷ 2 = 38086 remainder 0\n     - 38086 ÷ 2 = 19043 remainder 0\n     - 19043 ÷ 2 = 9521 remainder 1\n     - 9521 ÷ 2 = 4760 remainder 1\n     - 4760 ÷ 2 = 2380 remainder 0\n     - 2380 ÷ 2 = 1190 remainder 0\n     - 1190 ÷ 2 = 595 remainder 0\n     - 595 ÷ 2 = 297 remainder 1\n     - 297 ÷ 2 = 148 remainder 1\n     - 148 ÷ 2 = 74 remainder 0\n     - 74 ÷ 2 = 37 remainder 0\n     - 37 ÷ 2 = 18 remainder 1\n     - 18 ÷ 2 = 9 remainder 0\n     - 9 ÷ 2 = 4 remainder 1\n     - 4 ÷ 2 = 2 remainder 0\n     - 2 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 0\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 1248014695 is: `1001010011011100001101010100111`.\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, count the number of 1s in the binary representation `1001010011011100001101010100111`.\n   - The binary string has the following 1s: 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1.\n   - Count the 1s: There are 17 ones in the binary representation.\n\nTherefore, the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 1248014695 is 17.\n\nFinal answer: <<<17>>>."
