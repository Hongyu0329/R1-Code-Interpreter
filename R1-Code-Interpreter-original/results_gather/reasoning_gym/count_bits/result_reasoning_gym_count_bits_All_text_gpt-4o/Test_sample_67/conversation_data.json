    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 867536309, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Decimal Number to Binary:**\n   - The first step is to convert the decimal number 867536309 into its binary form. This involves dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder, then continuing with the quotient until the quotient is 0. The binary representation is the sequence of remainders read from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 867536309 and divide by 2:\n     - 867536309 ÷ 2 = 433768154 remainder 1\n     - 433768154 ÷ 2 = 216884077 remainder 0\n     - 216884077 ÷ 2 = 108442038 remainder 1\n     - 108442038 ÷ 2 = 54221019 remainder 0\n     - 54221019 ÷ 2 = 27110509 remainder 1\n     - 27110509 ÷ 2 = 13555254 remainder 1\n     - 13555254 ÷ 2 = 6777627 remainder 0\n     - 6777627 ÷ 2 = 3388813 remainder 1\n     - 3388813 ÷ 2 = 1694406 remainder 1\n     - 1694406 ÷ 2 = 847203 remainder 0\n     - 847203 ÷ 2 = 423601 remainder 1\n     - 423601 ÷ 2 = 211800 remainder 1\n     - 211800 ÷ 2 = 105900 remainder 0\n     - 105900 ÷ 2 = 52950 remainder 0\n     - 52950 ÷ 2 = 26475 remainder 0\n     - 26475 ÷ 2 = 13237 remainder 1\n     - 13237 ÷ 2 = 6618 remainder 1\n     - 6618 ÷ 2 = 3309 remainder 0\n     - 3309 ÷ 2 = 1654 remainder 1\n     - 1654 ÷ 2 = 827 remainder 0\n     - 827 ÷ 2 = 413 remainder 1\n     - 413 ÷ 2 = 206 remainder 1\n     - 206 ÷ 2 = 103 remainder 0\n     - 103 ÷ 2 = 51 remainder 1\n     - 51 ÷ 2 = 25 remainder 1\n     - 25 ÷ 2 = 12 remainder 1\n     - 12 ÷ 2 = 6 remainder 0\n     - 6 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 0\n     - 3 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 1\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 867536309 is: \n     110011110111111101011111010101\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, count the number of 1s in the binary representation:\n     - 110011110111111101011111010101\n     - Count each 1: There are 22 ones in this binary string.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 867536309 is 22.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<22>>>"
