    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 517405045, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, convert the decimal number 517405045 to its binary form. This can be done by repeatedly dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder. The binary representation is constructed by reading the remainders from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 517405045 and divide by 2:\n     - 517405045 ÷ 2 = 258702522 remainder 1\n     - 258702522 ÷ 2 = 129351261 remainder 0\n     - 129351261 ÷ 2 = 64675630 remainder 1\n     - 64675630 ÷ 2 = 32337815 remainder 0\n     - 32337815 ÷ 2 = 16168907 remainder 1\n     - 16168907 ÷ 2 = 8084453 remainder 1\n     - 8084453 ÷ 2 = 4042226 remainder 1\n     - 4042226 ÷ 2 = 2021113 remainder 0\n     - 2021113 ÷ 2 = 1010556 remainder 1\n     - 1010556 ÷ 2 = 505278 remainder 0\n     - 505278 ÷ 2 = 252639 remainder 0\n     - 252639 ÷ 2 = 126319 remainder 1\n     - 126319 ÷ 2 = 63159 remainder 1\n     - 63159 ÷ 2 = 31579 remainder 1\n     - 31579 ÷ 2 = 15789 remainder 1\n     - 15789 ÷ 2 = 7894 remainder 1\n     - 7894 ÷ 2 = 3947 remainder 0\n     - 3947 ÷ 2 = 1973 remainder 1\n     - 1973 ÷ 2 = 986 remainder 1\n     - 986 ÷ 2 = 493 remainder 0\n     - 493 ÷ 2 = 246 remainder 1\n     - 246 ÷ 2 = 123 remainder 0\n     - 123 ÷ 2 = 61 remainder 1\n     - 61 ÷ 2 = 30 remainder 1\n     - 30 ÷ 2 = 15 remainder 0\n     - 15 ÷ 2 = 7 remainder 1\n     - 7 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 1\n     - 3 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 1\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 517405045 is: \n     111101101101101101101101101101\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, count the number of 1s in the binary representation.\n   - The binary number 111101101101101101101101101101 contains 24 ones.\n\nTherefore, the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 517405045 is 24.\n\nFinal answer: <<<24>>>"
