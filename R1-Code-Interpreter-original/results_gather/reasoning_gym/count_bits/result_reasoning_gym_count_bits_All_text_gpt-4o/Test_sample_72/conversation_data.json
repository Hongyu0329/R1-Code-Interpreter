    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 2061500414, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, convert the decimal number 2061500414 into its binary form. This can be done by repeatedly dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder. The binary representation is constructed by reading the remainders from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 2061500414 and divide by 2:\n     - 2061500414 ÷ 2 = 1030750207 remainder 0\n     - 1030750207 ÷ 2 = 515375103 remainder 1\n     - 515375103 ÷ 2 = 257687551 remainder 1\n     - 257687551 ÷ 2 = 128843775 remainder 1\n     - 128843775 ÷ 2 = 64421887 remainder 1\n     - 64421887 ÷ 2 = 32210943 remainder 1\n     - 32210943 ÷ 2 = 16105471 remainder 1\n     - 16105471 ÷ 2 = 8052735 remainder 1\n     - 8052735 ÷ 2 = 4026367 remainder 1\n     - 4026367 ÷ 2 = 2013183 remainder 1\n     - 2013183 ÷ 2 = 1006591 remainder 1\n     - 1006591 ÷ 2 = 503295 remainder 1\n     - 503295 ÷ 2 = 251647 remainder 1\n     - 251647 ÷ 2 = 125823 remainder 1\n     - 125823 ÷ 2 = 62911 remainder 1\n     - 62911 ÷ 2 = 31455 remainder 1\n     - 31455 ÷ 2 = 15727 remainder 1\n     - 15727 ÷ 2 = 7863 remainder 1\n     - 7863 ÷ 2 = 3931 remainder 1\n     - 3931 ÷ 2 = 1965 remainder 1\n     - 1965 ÷ 2 = 982 remainder 1\n     - 982 ÷ 2 = 491 remainder 0\n     - 491 ÷ 2 = 245 remainder 1\n     - 245 ÷ 2 = 122 remainder 1\n     - 122 ÷ 2 = 61 remainder 0\n     - 61 ÷ 2 = 30 remainder 1\n     - 30 ÷ 2 = 15 remainder 0\n     - 15 ÷ 2 = 7 remainder 1\n     - 7 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 1\n     - 3 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 1\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 2061500414 is: \n     1111010101010101010101010111110\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, count the number of 1s in the binary representation:\n     - The binary number 1111010101010101010101010111110 contains 22 ones.\n\nTherefore, the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 2061500414 is 22.\n\nFinal answer: <<<22>>>"
