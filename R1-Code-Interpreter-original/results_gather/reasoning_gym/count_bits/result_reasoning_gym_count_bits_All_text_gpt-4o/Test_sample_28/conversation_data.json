    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 661009984, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, convert the decimal number 661009984 to its binary form. This can be done by repeatedly dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder. The binary representation is constructed by reading the remainders from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 661009984 and divide by 2:\n     - 661009984 ÷ 2 = 330504992, remainder 0\n     - 330504992 ÷ 2 = 165252496, remainder 0\n     - 165252496 ÷ 2 = 82626248, remainder 0\n     - 82626248 ÷ 2 = 41313124, remainder 0\n     - 41313124 ÷ 2 = 20656562, remainder 0\n     - 20656562 ÷ 2 = 10328281, remainder 0\n     - 10328281 ÷ 2 = 5164140, remainder 1\n     - 5164140 ÷ 2 = 2582070, remainder 0\n     - 2582070 ÷ 2 = 1291035, remainder 0\n     - 1291035 ÷ 2 = 645517, remainder 1\n     - 645517 ÷ 2 = 322758, remainder 1\n     - 322758 ÷ 2 = 161379, remainder 0\n     - 161379 ÷ 2 = 80689, remainder 1\n     - 80689 ÷ 2 = 40344, remainder 1\n     - 40344 ÷ 2 = 20172, remainder 0\n     - 20172 ÷ 2 = 10086, remainder 0\n     - 10086 ÷ 2 = 5043, remainder 0\n     - 5043 ÷ 2 = 2521, remainder 1\n     - 2521 ÷ 2 = 1260, remainder 1\n     - 1260 ÷ 2 = 630, remainder 0\n     - 630 ÷ 2 = 315, remainder 0\n     - 315 ÷ 2 = 157, remainder 1\n     - 157 ÷ 2 = 78, remainder 1\n     - 78 ÷ 2 = 39, remainder 0\n     - 39 ÷ 2 = 19, remainder 1\n     - 19 ÷ 2 = 9, remainder 1\n     - 9 ÷ 2 = 4, remainder 1\n     - 4 ÷ 2 = 2, remainder 0\n     - 2 ÷ 2 = 1, remainder 0\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0, remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 661009984 is: `10011101101000000000000000000`.\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - In the binary representation `10011101101000000000000000000`, count the number of 1s.\n   - The binary string has the following 1s: `1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1`.\n   - There are 8 occurrences of the digit 1.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 661009984 is 8.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<8>>>"
