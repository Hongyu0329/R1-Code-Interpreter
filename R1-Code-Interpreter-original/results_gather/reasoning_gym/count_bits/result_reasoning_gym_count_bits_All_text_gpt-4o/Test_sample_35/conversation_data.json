    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 160618377, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, we need to convert the decimal number 160618377 into its binary form. This involves dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder, then continuing with the quotient until the quotient is 0. The binary representation is the sequence of remainders read in reverse order.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Let's perform the conversion step by step:\n     - 160618377 ÷ 2 = 80309188 remainder 1\n     - 80309188 ÷ 2 = 40154594 remainder 0\n     - 40154594 ÷ 2 = 20077297 remainder 0\n     - 20077297 ÷ 2 = 10038648 remainder 1\n     - 10038648 ÷ 2 = 5019324 remainder 0\n     - 5019324 ÷ 2 = 2509662 remainder 0\n     - 2509662 ÷ 2 = 1254831 remainder 0\n     - 1254831 ÷ 2 = 627415 remainder 1\n     - 627415 ÷ 2 = 313707 remainder 1\n     - 313707 ÷ 2 = 156853 remainder 1\n     - 156853 ÷ 2 = 78426 remainder 1\n     - 78426 ÷ 2 = 39213 remainder 0\n     - 39213 ÷ 2 = 19606 remainder 1\n     - 19606 ÷ 2 = 9803 remainder 0\n     - 9803 ÷ 2 = 4901 remainder 1\n     - 4901 ÷ 2 = 2450 remainder 1\n     - 2450 ÷ 2 = 1225 remainder 0\n     - 1225 ÷ 2 = 612 remainder 1\n     - 612 ÷ 2 = 306 remainder 0\n     - 306 ÷ 2 = 153 remainder 0\n     - 153 ÷ 2 = 76 remainder 1\n     - 76 ÷ 2 = 38 remainder 0\n     - 38 ÷ 2 = 19 remainder 0\n     - 19 ÷ 2 = 9 remainder 1\n     - 9 ÷ 2 = 4 remainder 1\n     - 4 ÷ 2 = 2 remainder 0\n     - 2 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 0\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 160618377 is: 1001100100101100111011101001.\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, we need to count the number of 1s in the binary representation.\n   - The binary number 1001100100101100111011101001 contains the following 1s:\n     - 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1\n   - Counting the 1s, we find there are 16 ones.\n\nTherefore, the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 160618377 is 16.\n\n<<<16>>>"
