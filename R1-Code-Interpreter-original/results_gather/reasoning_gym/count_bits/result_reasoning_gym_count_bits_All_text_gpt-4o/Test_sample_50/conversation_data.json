    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 310785018, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, convert the decimal number 310785018 to its binary form. This can be done by repeatedly dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder. The binary representation is constructed by reading the remainders from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 310785018 and divide by 2:\n     - 310785018 ÷ 2 = 155392509 with a remainder of 0\n     - 155392509 ÷ 2 = 77696254 with a remainder of 1\n     - 77696254 ÷ 2 = 38848127 with a remainder of 0\n     - 38848127 ÷ 2 = 19424063 with a remainder of 1\n     - 19424063 ÷ 2 = 9712031 with a remainder of 1\n     - 9712031 ÷ 2 = 4856015 with a remainder of 1\n     - 4856015 ÷ 2 = 2428007 with a remainder of 1\n     - 2428007 ÷ 2 = 1214003 with a remainder of 1\n     - 1214003 ÷ 2 = 607001 with a remainder of 1\n     - 607001 ÷ 2 = 303500 with a remainder of 1\n     - 303500 ÷ 2 = 151750 with a remainder of 0\n     - 151750 ÷ 2 = 75875 with a remainder of 0\n     - 75875 ÷ 2 = 37937 with a remainder of 1\n     - 37937 ÷ 2 = 18968 with a remainder of 1\n     - 18968 ÷ 2 = 9484 with a remainder of 0\n     - 9484 ÷ 2 = 4742 with a remainder of 0\n     - 4742 ÷ 2 = 2371 with a remainder of 0\n     - 2371 ÷ 2 = 1185 with a remainder of 1\n     - 1185 ÷ 2 = 592 with a remainder of 1\n     - 592 ÷ 2 = 296 with a remainder of 0\n     - 296 ÷ 2 = 148 with a remainder of 0\n     - 148 ÷ 2 = 74 with a remainder of 0\n     - 74 ÷ 2 = 37 with a remainder of 0\n     - 37 ÷ 2 = 18 with a remainder of 1\n     - 18 ÷ 2 = 9 with a remainder of 0\n     - 9 ÷ 2 = 4 with a remainder of 1\n     - 4 ÷ 2 = 2 with a remainder of 0\n     - 2 ÷ 2 = 1 with a remainder of 0\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 with a remainder of 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 310785018 is: `100100000111111111111111101010`.\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - In the binary representation `100100000111111111111111101010`, count the number of 1s.\n   - The binary string contains 16 ones.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 310785018 is 16.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<16>>>"
