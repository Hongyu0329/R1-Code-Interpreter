    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 1178312692, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - The first step is to convert the decimal number 1178312692 into its binary form. This involves dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder, then continuing with the quotient until the quotient is 0. The binary representation is the sequence of remainders read from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Count the 1 Bits:**\n   - Once we have the binary representation, we need to count the number of 1s in this binary string. Each 1 represents a bit that is set to true in the binary representation.\n\n3. **Verify the Conversion:**\n   - It's important to ensure that the conversion from decimal to binary is done correctly to avoid any errors in counting the 1 bits.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n- **Step 1: Convert 1178312692 to Binary:**\n  - Performing the conversion, we find that the binary representation of 1178312692 is `10001100011010111011010111100100`.\n\n- **Step 2: Count the 1 Bits:**\n  - In the binary string `10001100011010111011010111100100`, we count the number of 1s.\n  - The binary string has the following 1s: `1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1`.\n\n- **Step 3: Verify the Count:**\n  - Double-checking the binary string, we confirm that there are 14 occurrences of the digit 1.\n\nTherefore, the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 1178312692 is 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"
