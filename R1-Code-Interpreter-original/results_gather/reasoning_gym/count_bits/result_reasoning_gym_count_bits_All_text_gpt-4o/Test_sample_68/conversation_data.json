    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 312822346, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, convert the decimal number 312822346 into its binary form. This can be done by repeatedly dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder. The binary representation is constructed by reading the remainders from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 312822346 and divide by 2:\n     - 312822346 ÷ 2 = 156411173 remainder 0\n     - 156411173 ÷ 2 = 78205586 remainder 1\n     - 78205586 ÷ 2 = 39102793 remainder 0\n     - 39102793 ÷ 2 = 19551396 remainder 1\n     - 19551396 ÷ 2 = 9775698 remainder 0\n     - 9775698 ÷ 2 = 4887849 remainder 0\n     - 4887849 ÷ 2 = 2443924 remainder 1\n     - 2443924 ÷ 2 = 1221962 remainder 0\n     - 1221962 ÷ 2 = 610981 remainder 0\n     - 610981 ÷ 2 = 305490 remainder 1\n     - 305490 ÷ 2 = 152745 remainder 0\n     - 152745 ÷ 2 = 76372 remainder 1\n     - 76372 ÷ 2 = 38186 remainder 0\n     - 38186 ÷ 2 = 19093 remainder 0\n     - 19093 ÷ 2 = 9546 remainder 1\n     - 9546 ÷ 2 = 4773 remainder 0\n     - 4773 ÷ 2 = 2386 remainder 1\n     - 2386 ÷ 2 = 1193 remainder 0\n     - 1193 ÷ 2 = 596 remainder 1\n     - 596 ÷ 2 = 298 remainder 0\n     - 298 ÷ 2 = 149 remainder 0\n     - 149 ÷ 2 = 74 remainder 1\n     - 74 ÷ 2 = 37 remainder 0\n     - 37 ÷ 2 = 18 remainder 1\n     - 18 ÷ 2 = 9 remainder 0\n     - 9 ÷ 2 = 4 remainder 1\n     - 4 ÷ 2 = 2 remainder 0\n     - 2 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 0\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 312822346 is: `10010101011011010110111001010`.\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, count the number of 1s in the binary representation `10010101011011010110111001010`.\n\n4. **Perform the Count:**\n   - The binary string `10010101011011010110111001010` contains 16 ones.\n\nTherefore, the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 312822346 is 16.\n\nFinal answer: <<<16>>>."
