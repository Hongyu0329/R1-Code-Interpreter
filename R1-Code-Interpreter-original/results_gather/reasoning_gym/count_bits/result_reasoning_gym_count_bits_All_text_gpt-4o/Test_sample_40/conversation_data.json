    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 157682544, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, convert the decimal number 157682544 into its binary form. This can be done by repeatedly dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder. The binary representation is constructed by reading the remainders from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 157682544 and divide by 2:\n     - 157682544 ÷ 2 = 78841272 remainder 0\n     - 78841272 ÷ 2 = 39420636 remainder 0\n     - 39420636 ÷ 2 = 19710318 remainder 0\n     - 19710318 ÷ 2 = 9855159 remainder 0\n     - 9855159 ÷ 2 = 4927579 remainder 1\n     - 4927579 ÷ 2 = 2463789 remainder 1\n     - 2463789 ÷ 2 = 1231894 remainder 1\n     - 1231894 ÷ 2 = 615947 remainder 0\n     - 615947 ÷ 2 = 307973 remainder 1\n     - 307973 ÷ 2 = 153986 remainder 1\n     - 153986 ÷ 2 = 76993 remainder 0\n     - 76993 ÷ 2 = 38496 remainder 1\n     - 38496 ÷ 2 = 19248 remainder 0\n     - 19248 ÷ 2 = 9624 remainder 0\n     - 9624 ÷ 2 = 4812 remainder 0\n     - 4812 ÷ 2 = 2406 remainder 0\n     - 2406 ÷ 2 = 1203 remainder 0\n     - 1203 ÷ 2 = 601 remainder 1\n     - 601 ÷ 2 = 300 remainder 1\n     - 300 ÷ 2 = 150 remainder 0\n     - 150 ÷ 2 = 75 remainder 0\n     - 75 ÷ 2 = 37 remainder 1\n     - 37 ÷ 2 = 18 remainder 1\n     - 18 ÷ 2 = 9 remainder 0\n     - 9 ÷ 2 = 4 remainder 1\n     - 4 ÷ 2 = 2 remainder 0\n     - 2 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 0\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 157682544 is: `1001011001101101101101100000`.\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, count the number of 1s in the binary representation `1001011001101101101101100000`.\n   - The binary string has the following 1s: `1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1`.\n\n4. **Calculate the Total:**\n   - There are 12 occurrences of the digit 1 in the binary representation.\n\nTherefore, the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 157682544 is 12.\n\nFinal answer: <<<12>>>."
