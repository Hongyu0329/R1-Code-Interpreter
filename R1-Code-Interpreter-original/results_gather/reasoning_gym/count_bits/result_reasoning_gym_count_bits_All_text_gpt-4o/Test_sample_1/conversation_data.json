    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 1224770973, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, we need to convert the decimal number 1224770973 into its binary form. This involves dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder, then repeating the process with the quotient until the quotient is zero. The binary representation is the sequence of remainders read in reverse order.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Let's perform the conversion:\n     - 1224770973 ÷ 2 = 612385486 remainder 1\n     - 612385486 ÷ 2 = 306192743 remainder 0\n     - 306192743 ÷ 2 = 153096371 remainder 1\n     - 153096371 ÷ 2 = 76548185 remainder 1\n     - 76548185 ÷ 2 = 38274092 remainder 1\n     - 38274092 ÷ 2 = 19137046 remainder 0\n     - 19137046 ÷ 2 = 9568523 remainder 0\n     - 9568523 ÷ 2 = 4784261 remainder 1\n     - 4784261 ÷ 2 = 2392130 remainder 1\n     - 2392130 ÷ 2 = 1196065 remainder 0\n     - 1196065 ÷ 2 = 598032 remainder 1\n     - 598032 ÷ 2 = 299016 remainder 0\n     - 299016 ÷ 2 = 149508 remainder 0\n     - 149508 ÷ 2 = 74754 remainder 0\n     - 74754 ÷ 2 = 37377 remainder 0\n     - 37377 ÷ 2 = 18688 remainder 1\n     - 18688 ÷ 2 = 9344 remainder 0\n     - 9344 ÷ 2 = 4672 remainder 0\n     - 4672 ÷ 2 = 2336 remainder 0\n     - 2336 ÷ 2 = 1168 remainder 0\n     - 1168 ÷ 2 = 584 remainder 0\n     - 584 ÷ 2 = 292 remainder 0\n     - 292 ÷ 2 = 146 remainder 0\n     - 146 ÷ 2 = 73 remainder 0\n     - 73 ÷ 2 = 36 remainder 1\n     - 36 ÷ 2 = 18 remainder 0\n     - 18 ÷ 2 = 9 remainder 0\n     - 9 ÷ 2 = 4 remainder 1\n     - 4 ÷ 2 = 2 remainder 0\n     - 2 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 0\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 1224770973 is: \n     1001001000111101101101011011101\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, we need to count the number of 1s in the binary representation.\n   - The binary number 1001001000111101101101011011101 contains 17 ones.\n\nTherefore, the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 1224770973 is 17.\n\nFinal answer: <<<17>>>"
