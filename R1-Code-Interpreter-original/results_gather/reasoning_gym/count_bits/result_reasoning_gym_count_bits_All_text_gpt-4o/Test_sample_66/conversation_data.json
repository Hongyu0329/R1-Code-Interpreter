    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 765,359,322, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, convert the decimal number 765,359,322 to its binary form. This can be done using the division-by-2 method, where you repeatedly divide the number by 2 and record the remainder. The binary representation is obtained by reading the remainders in reverse order.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 765,359,322 and divide by 2:\n     - 765,359,322 ÷ 2 = 382,679,661 remainder 0\n     - 382,679,661 ÷ 2 = 191,339,830 remainder 1\n     - 191,339,830 ÷ 2 = 95,669,915 remainder 0\n     - 95,669,915 ÷ 2 = 47,834,957 remainder 1\n     - 47,834,957 ÷ 2 = 23,917,478 remainder 1\n     - 23,917,478 ÷ 2 = 11,958,739 remainder 0\n     - 11,958,739 ÷ 2 = 5,979,369 remainder 1\n     - 5,979,369 ÷ 2 = 2,989,684 remainder 1\n     - 2,989,684 ÷ 2 = 1,494,842 remainder 0\n     - 1,494,842 ÷ 2 = 747,421 remainder 0\n     - 747,421 ÷ 2 = 373,710 remainder 1\n     - 373,710 ÷ 2 = 186,855 remainder 0\n     - 186,855 ÷ 2 = 93,427 remainder 1\n     - 93,427 ÷ 2 = 46,713 remainder 1\n     - 46,713 ÷ 2 = 23,356 remainder 1\n     - 23,356 ÷ 2 = 11,678 remainder 0\n     - 11,678 ÷ 2 = 5,839 remainder 0\n     - 5,839 ÷ 2 = 2,919 remainder 1\n     - 2,919 ÷ 2 = 1,459 remainder 1\n     - 1,459 ÷ 2 = 729 remainder 1\n     - 729 ÷ 2 = 364 remainder 1\n     - 364 ÷ 2 = 182 remainder 0\n     - 182 ÷ 2 = 91 remainder 0\n     - 91 ÷ 2 = 45 remainder 1\n     - 45 ÷ 2 = 22 remainder 1\n     - 22 ÷ 2 = 11 remainder 0\n     - 11 ÷ 2 = 5 remainder 1\n     - 5 ÷ 2 = 2 remainder 1\n     - 2 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 0\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 765,359,322 is:\n     - 1011011011011011011011011011010\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, count the number of 1s in the binary representation:\n     - 1011011011011011011011011011010 has 21 ones.\n\nTherefore, the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 765,359,322 is 21.\n\nFinal answer: <<<21>>>."
