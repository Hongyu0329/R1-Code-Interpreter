    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 143632255, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - The first step is to convert the decimal number 143632255 into its binary form. This involves dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder, then continuing with the quotient until the quotient is 0. The binary representation is the sequence of remainders read in reverse order.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Let's perform the conversion:\n     - 143632255 ÷ 2 = 71816127 remainder 1\n     - 71816127 ÷ 2 = 35908063 remainder 1\n     - 35908063 ÷ 2 = 17954031 remainder 1\n     - 17954031 ÷ 2 = 8977015 remainder 1\n     - 8977015 ÷ 2 = 4488507 remainder 1\n     - 4488507 ÷ 2 = 2244253 remainder 1\n     - 2244253 ÷ 2 = 1122126 remainder 1\n     - 1122126 ÷ 2 = 561063 remainder 0\n     - 561063 ÷ 2 = 280531 remainder 1\n     - 280531 ÷ 2 = 140265 remainder 1\n     - 140265 ÷ 2 = 70132 remainder 1\n     - 70132 ÷ 2 = 35066 remainder 0\n     - 35066 ÷ 2 = 17533 remainder 0\n     - 17533 ÷ 2 = 8766 remainder 1\n     - 8766 ÷ 2 = 4383 remainder 0\n     - 4383 ÷ 2 = 2191 remainder 1\n     - 2191 ÷ 2 = 1095 remainder 1\n     - 1095 ÷ 2 = 547 remainder 1\n     - 547 ÷ 2 = 273 remainder 1\n     - 273 ÷ 2 = 136 remainder 1\n     - 136 ÷ 2 = 68 remainder 0\n     - 68 ÷ 2 = 34 remainder 0\n     - 34 ÷ 2 = 17 remainder 0\n     - 17 ÷ 2 = 8 remainder 1\n     - 8 ÷ 2 = 4 remainder 0\n     - 4 ÷ 2 = 2 remainder 0\n     - 2 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 0\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 143632255 is: \n     100010001111111111111111111\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, we need to count the number of 1s in the binary representation.\n   - The binary number 100010001111111111111111111 contains 22 ones.\n\nTherefore, the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 143632255 is 22.\n\nFinal answer: <<<22>>>"
