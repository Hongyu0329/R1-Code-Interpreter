    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 795764321, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Decimal Number to Binary:**\n   - The first step is to convert the decimal number 795764321 into its binary form. This involves dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder, then continuing with the quotient until the quotient is 0. The binary representation is the sequence of remainders read from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 795764321 and divide by 2:\n     - 795764321 ÷ 2 = 397882160 remainder 1\n     - 397882160 ÷ 2 = 198941080 remainder 0\n     - 198941080 ÷ 2 = 99470540 remainder 0\n     - 99470540 ÷ 2 = 49735270 remainder 0\n     - 49735270 ÷ 2 = 24867635 remainder 0\n     - 24867635 ÷ 2 = 12433817 remainder 1\n     - 12433817 ÷ 2 = 6216908 remainder 1\n     - 6216908 ÷ 2 = 3108454 remainder 0\n     - 3108454 ÷ 2 = 1554227 remainder 0\n     - 1554227 ÷ 2 = 777113 remainder 1\n     - 777113 ÷ 2 = 388556 remainder 1\n     - 388556 ÷ 2 = 194278 remainder 0\n     - 194278 ÷ 2 = 97139 remainder 0\n     - 97139 ÷ 2 = 48569 remainder 1\n     - 48569 ÷ 2 = 24284 remainder 1\n     - 24284 ÷ 2 = 12142 remainder 0\n     - 12142 ÷ 2 = 6071 remainder 0\n     - 6071 ÷ 2 = 3035 remainder 1\n     - 3035 ÷ 2 = 1517 remainder 1\n     - 1517 ÷ 2 = 758 remainder 1\n     - 758 ÷ 2 = 379 remainder 0\n     - 379 ÷ 2 = 189 remainder 1\n     - 189 ÷ 2 = 94 remainder 1\n     - 94 ÷ 2 = 47 remainder 0\n     - 47 ÷ 2 = 23 remainder 1\n     - 23 ÷ 2 = 11 remainder 1\n     - 11 ÷ 2 = 5 remainder 1\n     - 5 ÷ 2 = 2 remainder 1\n     - 2 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 0\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 795764321 is: \n     1011110111110101111011100000001\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, count the number of 1s in the binary representation:\n     - 1011110111110101111011100000001\n     - Count each '1': There are 19 ones in this binary string.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 795764321 is 19.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<19>>>"
