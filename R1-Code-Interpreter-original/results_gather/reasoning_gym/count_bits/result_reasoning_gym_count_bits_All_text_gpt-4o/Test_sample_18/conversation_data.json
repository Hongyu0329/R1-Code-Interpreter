    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 1068451633, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, convert the decimal number 1068451633 into its binary form. This can be done by repeatedly dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder. The binary representation is constructed by reading the remainders from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 1068451633 and divide by 2:\n     - 1068451633 ÷ 2 = 534225816 with a remainder of 1\n     - 534225816 ÷ 2 = 267112908 with a remainder of 0\n     - 267112908 ÷ 2 = 133556454 with a remainder of 0\n     - 133556454 ÷ 2 = 66778227 with a remainder of 0\n     - 66778227 ÷ 2 = 33389113 with a remainder of 1\n     - 33389113 ÷ 2 = 16694556 with a remainder of 1\n     - 16694556 ÷ 2 = 8347278 with a remainder of 0\n     - 8347278 ÷ 2 = 4173639 with a remainder of 0\n     - 4173639 ÷ 2 = 2086819 with a remainder of 1\n     - 2086819 ÷ 2 = 1043409 with a remainder of 1\n     - 1043409 ÷ 2 = 521704 with a remainder of 1\n     - 521704 ÷ 2 = 260852 with a remainder of 0\n     - 260852 ÷ 2 = 130426 with a remainder of 0\n     - 130426 ÷ 2 = 65213 with a remainder of 0\n     - 65213 ÷ 2 = 32606 with a remainder of 1\n     - 32606 ÷ 2 = 16303 with a remainder of 0\n     - 16303 ÷ 2 = 8151 with a remainder of 1\n     - 8151 ÷ 2 = 4075 with a remainder of 1\n     - 4075 ÷ 2 = 2037 with a remainder of 1\n     - 2037 ÷ 2 = 1018 with a remainder of 1\n     - 1018 ÷ 2 = 509 with a remainder of 0\n     - 509 ÷ 2 = 254 with a remainder of 1\n     - 254 ÷ 2 = 127 with a remainder of 0\n     - 127 ÷ 2 = 63 with a remainder of 1\n     - 63 ÷ 2 = 31 with a remainder of 1\n     - 31 ÷ 2 = 15 with a remainder of 1\n     - 15 ÷ 2 = 7 with a remainder of 1\n     - 7 ÷ 2 = 3 with a remainder of 1\n     - 3 ÷ 2 = 1 with a remainder of 1\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 with a remainder of 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 1068451633 is: `1111111100000001100000000000001`.\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, count the number of 1s in the binary representation `1111111100000001100000000000001`.\n   - The binary string has 12 ones.\n\nTherefore, the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 1068451633 is 12.\n\nFinal answer: <<<12>>>."
