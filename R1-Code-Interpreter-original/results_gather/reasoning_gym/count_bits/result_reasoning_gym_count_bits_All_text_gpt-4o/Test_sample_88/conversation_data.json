    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 1105820836, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Decimal Number to Binary:**\n   - The first step is to convert the decimal number 1105820836 into its binary form. This can be done by repeatedly dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder. The binary representation is constructed by reading the remainders from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Divide 1105820836 by 2, the quotient is 552910418, and the remainder is 0.\n   - Divide 552910418 by 2, the quotient is 276455209, and the remainder is 0.\n   - Divide 276455209 by 2, the quotient is 138227604, and the remainder is 1.\n   - Divide 138227604 by 2, the quotient is 69113802, and the remainder is 0.\n   - Divide 69113802 by 2, the quotient is 34556901, and the remainder is 0.\n   - Divide 34556901 by 2, the quotient is 17278450, and the remainder is 1.\n   - Continue this process until the quotient is 0.\n\n3. **Construct the Binary Representation:**\n   - By following the division and remainder process, the binary representation of 1105820836 is obtained as: `1000001111110101111011111110100`.\n\n4. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, count the number of 1s in the binary representation.\n   - The binary number `1000001111110101111011111110100` contains 19 ones.\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   - The number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 1105820836 is 19.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<19>>>"
