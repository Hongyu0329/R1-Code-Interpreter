    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 437378955, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, we need to convert the decimal number 437378955 into its binary form. This involves dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder, then continuing with the quotient until the quotient is 0. The binary representation is the sequence of remainders read in reverse order.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 437378955 and divide by 2:\n     - 437378955 ÷ 2 = 218689477 remainder 1\n     - 218689477 ÷ 2 = 109344738 remainder 1\n     - 109344738 ÷ 2 = 54672369 remainder 0\n     - 54672369 ÷ 2 = 27336184 remainder 1\n     - 27336184 ÷ 2 = 13668092 remainder 0\n     - 13668092 ÷ 2 = 6834046 remainder 0\n     - 6834046 ÷ 2 = 3417023 remainder 0\n     - 3417023 ÷ 2 = 1708511 remainder 1\n     - 1708511 ÷ 2 = 854255 remainder 1\n     - 854255 ÷ 2 = 427127 remainder 1\n     - 427127 ÷ 2 = 213563 remainder 1\n     - 213563 ÷ 2 = 106781 remainder 1\n     - 106781 ÷ 2 = 53390 remainder 1\n     - 53390 ÷ 2 = 26695 remainder 0\n     - 26695 ÷ 2 = 13347 remainder 1\n     - 13347 ÷ 2 = 6673 remainder 1\n     - 6673 ÷ 2 = 3336 remainder 1\n     - 3336 ÷ 2 = 1668 remainder 0\n     - 1668 ÷ 2 = 834 remainder 0\n     - 834 ÷ 2 = 417 remainder 0\n     - 417 ÷ 2 = 208 remainder 1\n     - 208 ÷ 2 = 104 remainder 0\n     - 104 ÷ 2 = 52 remainder 0\n     - 52 ÷ 2 = 26 remainder 0\n     - 26 ÷ 2 = 13 remainder 0\n     - 13 ÷ 2 = 6 remainder 1\n     - 6 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 0\n     - 3 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 1\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 437378955 is: \n     11010000011111111111111111011\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, we need to count the number of 1s in the binary representation.\n   - The binary number 11010000011111111111111111011 contains 22 ones.\n\nTherefore, the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 437378955 is 22.\n\nFinal answer: <<<22>>>."
