    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 82789451, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Decimal Number to Binary:**\n   - The first step is to convert the decimal number 82789451 into its binary form. This involves dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder, then continuing with the quotient until the quotient is 0. The binary representation is the sequence of remainders read from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 82789451 and divide by 2:\n     - 82789451 ÷ 2 = 41394725 remainder 1\n     - 41394725 ÷ 2 = 20697362 remainder 1\n     - 20697362 ÷ 2 = 10348681 remainder 0\n     - 10348681 ÷ 2 = 5174340 remainder 1\n     - 5174340 ÷ 2 = 2587170 remainder 0\n     - 2587170 ÷ 2 = 1293585 remainder 0\n     - 1293585 ÷ 2 = 646792 remainder 1\n     - 646792 ÷ 2 = 323396 remainder 0\n     - 323396 ÷ 2 = 161698 remainder 0\n     - 161698 ÷ 2 = 80849 remainder 0\n     - 80849 ÷ 2 = 40424 remainder 1\n     - 40424 ÷ 2 = 20212 remainder 0\n     - 20212 ÷ 2 = 10106 remainder 0\n     - 10106 ÷ 2 = 5053 remainder 0\n     - 5053 ÷ 2 = 2526 remainder 1\n     - 2526 ÷ 2 = 1263 remainder 0\n     - 1263 ÷ 2 = 631 remainder 1\n     - 631 ÷ 2 = 315 remainder 1\n     - 315 ÷ 2 = 157 remainder 1\n     - 157 ÷ 2 = 78 remainder 1\n     - 78 ÷ 2 = 39 remainder 0\n     - 39 ÷ 2 = 19 remainder 1\n     - 19 ÷ 2 = 9 remainder 1\n     - 9 ÷ 2 = 4 remainder 1\n     - 4 ÷ 2 = 2 remainder 0\n     - 2 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 0\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 82789451 is: \n     1001111001111111111011011011\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, count the number of 1s in the binary representation:\n     - 1001111001111111111011011011\n     - Count each 1: There are 21 ones in this binary number.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 82789451 is 21.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<21>>>"
