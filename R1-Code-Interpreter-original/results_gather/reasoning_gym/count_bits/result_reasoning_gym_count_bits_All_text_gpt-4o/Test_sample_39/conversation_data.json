    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 695255021, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - The first step is to convert the decimal number 695255021 into its binary form. This involves dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder, then continuing with the quotient until the quotient is 0. The binary representation is the sequence of remainders read in reverse order.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 695255021 and divide by 2:\n     - 695255021 ÷ 2 = 347627510 remainder 1\n     - 347627510 ÷ 2 = 173813755 remainder 0\n     - 173813755 ÷ 2 = 86906877 remainder 1\n     - 86906877 ÷ 2 = 43453438 remainder 1\n     - 43453438 ÷ 2 = 21726719 remainder 0\n     - 21726719 ÷ 2 = 10863359 remainder 1\n     - 10863359 ÷ 2 = 5431679 remainder 1\n     - 5431679 ÷ 2 = 2715839 remainder 1\n     - 2715839 ÷ 2 = 1357919 remainder 1\n     - 1357919 ÷ 2 = 678959 remainder 1\n     - 678959 ÷ 2 = 339479 remainder 0\n     - 339479 ÷ 2 = 169739 remainder 1\n     - 169739 ÷ 2 = 84869 remainder 1\n     - 84869 ÷ 2 = 42434 remainder 1\n     - 42434 ÷ 2 = 21217 remainder 0\n     - 21217 ÷ 2 = 10608 remainder 1\n     - 10608 ÷ 2 = 5304 remainder 0\n     - 5304 ÷ 2 = 2652 remainder 0\n     - 2652 ÷ 2 = 1326 remainder 0\n     - 1326 ÷ 2 = 663 remainder 0\n     - 663 ÷ 2 = 331 remainder 1\n     - 331 ÷ 2 = 165 remainder 1\n     - 165 ÷ 2 = 82 remainder 1\n     - 82 ÷ 2 = 41 remainder 0\n     - 41 ÷ 2 = 20 remainder 1\n     - 20 ÷ 2 = 10 remainder 0\n     - 10 ÷ 2 = 5 remainder 0\n     - 5 ÷ 2 = 2 remainder 1\n     - 2 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 0\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 695255021 is: \n     10100101101011111000010111111101\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, count the number of 1s in the binary representation:\n     - 10100101101011111000010111111101\n     - Count each '1': There are 19 ones in this binary string.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 695255021 is 19.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<19>>>"
