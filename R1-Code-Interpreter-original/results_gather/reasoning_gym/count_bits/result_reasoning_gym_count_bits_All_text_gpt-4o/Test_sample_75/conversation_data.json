    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 529315984, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, convert the decimal number 529315984 to its binary form. This can be done by repeatedly dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder. The binary representation is constructed by reading the remainders from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 529315984 and divide by 2:\n     - 529315984 ÷ 2 = 264657992 remainder 0\n     - 264657992 ÷ 2 = 132328996 remainder 0\n     - 132328996 ÷ 2 = 66164498 remainder 0\n     - 66164498 ÷ 2 = 33082249 remainder 0\n     - 33082249 ÷ 2 = 16541124 remainder 1\n     - 16541124 ÷ 2 = 8270562 remainder 0\n     - 8270562 ÷ 2 = 4135281 remainder 0\n     - 4135281 ÷ 2 = 2067640 remainder 1\n     - 2067640 ÷ 2 = 1033820 remainder 0\n     - 1033820 ÷ 2 = 516910 remainder 0\n     - 516910 ÷ 2 = 258455 remainder 0\n     - 258455 ÷ 2 = 129227 remainder 1\n     - 129227 ÷ 2 = 64613 remainder 1\n     - 64613 ÷ 2 = 32306 remainder 1\n     - 32306 ÷ 2 = 16153 remainder 0\n     - 16153 ÷ 2 = 8076 remainder 1\n     - 8076 ÷ 2 = 4038 remainder 0\n     - 4038 ÷ 2 = 2019 remainder 0\n     - 2019 ÷ 2 = 1009 remainder 1\n     - 1009 ÷ 2 = 504 remainder 1\n     - 504 ÷ 2 = 252 remainder 0\n     - 252 ÷ 2 = 126 remainder 0\n     - 126 ÷ 2 = 63 remainder 0\n     - 63 ÷ 2 = 31 remainder 1\n     - 31 ÷ 2 = 15 remainder 1\n     - 15 ÷ 2 = 7 remainder 1\n     - 7 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 1\n     - 3 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 1\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 529315984 is: `11111100111111111111111100000`.\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, count the number of 1s in the binary representation `11111100111111111111111100000`.\n   - The binary string contains 18 ones.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 529315984 is 18.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<18>>>"
