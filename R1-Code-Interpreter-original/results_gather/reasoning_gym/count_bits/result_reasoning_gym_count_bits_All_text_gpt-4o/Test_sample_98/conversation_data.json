    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 1116214639, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Decimal Number to Binary:**\n   - The first step is to convert the decimal number 1116214639 into its binary form. This involves dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder, then continuing with the quotient until the quotient is 0. The binary representation is the sequence of remainders read in reverse order.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 1116214639 and divide by 2:\n     - 1116214639 ÷ 2 = 558107319 remainder 1\n     - 558107319 ÷ 2 = 279053659 remainder 1\n     - 279053659 ÷ 2 = 139526829 remainder 1\n     - 139526829 ÷ 2 = 69763414 remainder 1\n     - 69763414 ÷ 2 = 34881707 remainder 0\n     - 34881707 ÷ 2 = 17440853 remainder 1\n     - 17440853 ÷ 2 = 8720426 remainder 1\n     - 8720426 ÷ 2 = 4360213 remainder 0\n     - 4360213 ÷ 2 = 2180106 remainder 1\n     - 2180106 ÷ 2 = 1090053 remainder 0\n     - 1090053 ÷ 2 = 545026 remainder 1\n     - 545026 ÷ 2 = 272513 remainder 0\n     - 272513 ÷ 2 = 136256 remainder 1\n     - 136256 ÷ 2 = 68128 remainder 0\n     - 68128 ÷ 2 = 34064 remainder 0\n     - 34064 ÷ 2 = 17032 remainder 0\n     - 17032 ÷ 2 = 8516 remainder 0\n     - 8516 ÷ 2 = 4258 remainder 0\n     - 4258 ÷ 2 = 2129 remainder 0\n     - 2129 ÷ 2 = 1064 remainder 1\n     - 1064 ÷ 2 = 532 remainder 0\n     - 532 ÷ 2 = 266 remainder 0\n     - 266 ÷ 2 = 133 remainder 0\n     - 133 ÷ 2 = 66 remainder 1\n     - 66 ÷ 2 = 33 remainder 0\n     - 33 ÷ 2 = 16 remainder 1\n     - 16 ÷ 2 = 8 remainder 0\n     - 8 ÷ 2 = 4 remainder 0\n     - 4 ÷ 2 = 2 remainder 0\n     - 2 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 0\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 1116214639 is: \n     1000010101101110001111011111111\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, count the number of 1s in the binary representation:\n     - 1000010101101110001111011111111\n     - There are 19 ones in this binary number.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 1116214639 is 19.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<19>>>"
