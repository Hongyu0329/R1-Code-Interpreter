    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 1699789000, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, convert the decimal number 1699789000 to its binary form. This can be done using a method of successive division by 2, keeping track of the remainders, or by using a calculator or programming tool that provides binary conversion.\n\n2. **Understand Binary Representation:**\n   - Binary numbers are composed of bits, which are either 0 or 1. The task is to count how many of these bits are 1s.\n\n3. **Count the 1 Bits:**\n   - Once the binary representation is obtained, count the number of 1s present in the binary string.\n\n4. **Verify the Conversion:**\n   - Ensure that the binary conversion is correct by possibly converting back to decimal to check for consistency.\n\n5. **Output the Result:**\n   - After counting the 1 bits, output the result in the specified format.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n- **Step 1: Convert 1699789000 to Binary:**\n  - The binary representation of 1699789000 is `1100101010101011111011111101000`.\n\n- **Step 2: Count the 1 Bits:**\n  - In the binary string `1100101010101011111011111101000`, count the number of 1s.\n\n- **Step 3: Count:**\n  - The binary string has the following 1s: `1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0`.\n  - Counting the 1s gives us a total of 17 ones.\n\n- **Step 4: Verify:**\n  - Double-check the binary conversion and the count to ensure accuracy.\n\n- **Step 5: Output the Result:**\n  - The number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 1699789000 is 17.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<17>>>"
