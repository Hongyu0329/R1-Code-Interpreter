    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 795,845,217, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Decimal Number to Binary:**\n   - The first step is to convert the decimal number 795,845,217 into its binary form. This involves dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder, then repeating the process with the quotient until the quotient is zero. The binary representation is obtained by reading the remainders in reverse order.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 795,845,217 and divide by 2:\n     - 795,845,217 ÷ 2 = 397,922,608 remainder 1\n     - 397,922,608 ÷ 2 = 198,961,304 remainder 0\n     - 198,961,304 ÷ 2 = 99,480,652 remainder 0\n     - 99,480,652 ÷ 2 = 49,740,326 remainder 0\n     - 49,740,326 ÷ 2 = 24,870,163 remainder 0\n     - 24,870,163 ÷ 2 = 12,435,081 remainder 1\n     - 12,435,081 ÷ 2 = 6,217,540 remainder 1\n     - 6,217,540 ÷ 2 = 3,108,770 remainder 0\n     - 3,108,770 ÷ 2 = 1,554,385 remainder 0\n     - 1,554,385 ÷ 2 = 777,192 remainder 1\n     - 777,192 ÷ 2 = 388,596 remainder 0\n     - 388,596 ÷ 2 = 194,298 remainder 0\n     - 194,298 ÷ 2 = 97,149 remainder 0\n     - 97,149 ÷ 2 = 48,574 remainder 1\n     - 48,574 ÷ 2 = 24,287 remainder 0\n     - 24,287 ÷ 2 = 12,143 remainder 1\n     - 12,143 ÷ 2 = 6,071 remainder 1\n     - 6,071 ÷ 2 = 3,035 remainder 1\n     - 3,035 ÷ 2 = 1,517 remainder 1\n     - 1,517 ÷ 2 = 758 remainder 1\n     - 758 ÷ 2 = 379 remainder 0\n     - 379 ÷ 2 = 189 remainder 1\n     - 189 ÷ 2 = 94 remainder 1\n     - 94 ÷ 2 = 47 remainder 0\n     - 47 ÷ 2 = 23 remainder 1\n     - 23 ÷ 2 = 11 remainder 1\n     - 11 ÷ 2 = 5 remainder 1\n     - 5 ÷ 2 = 2 remainder 1\n     - 2 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 0\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 795,845,217 is:\n     - 1011110110111101111011110000001\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, count the number of 1s in the binary representation:\n     - 1011110110111101111011110000001\n     - There are 21 ones in this binary number.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 795,845,217 is 21.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<21>>>"
