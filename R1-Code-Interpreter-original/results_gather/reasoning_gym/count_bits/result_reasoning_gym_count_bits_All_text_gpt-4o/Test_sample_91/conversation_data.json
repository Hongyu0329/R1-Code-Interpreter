    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 112449972, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, convert the decimal number 112449972 into its binary form. This can be done by repeatedly dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder. The binary representation is constructed by reading the remainders from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 112449972 and divide by 2:\n     - 112449972 ÷ 2 = 56224986 remainder 0\n     - 56224986 ÷ 2 = 28112493 remainder 0\n     - 28112493 ÷ 2 = 14056246 remainder 1\n     - 14056246 ÷ 2 = 7028123 remainder 0\n     - 7028123 ÷ 2 = 3514061 remainder 1\n     - 3514061 ÷ 2 = 1757030 remainder 1\n     - 1757030 ÷ 2 = 878515 remainder 0\n     - 878515 ÷ 2 = 439257 remainder 1\n     - 439257 ÷ 2 = 219628 remainder 1\n     - 219628 ÷ 2 = 109814 remainder 0\n     - 109814 ÷ 2 = 54907 remainder 0\n     - 54907 ÷ 2 = 27453 remainder 1\n     - 27453 ÷ 2 = 13726 remainder 1\n     - 13726 ÷ 2 = 6863 remainder 0\n     - 6863 ÷ 2 = 3431 remainder 1\n     - 3431 ÷ 2 = 1715 remainder 1\n     - 1715 ÷ 2 = 857 remainder 1\n     - 857 ÷ 2 = 428 remainder 1\n     - 428 ÷ 2 = 214 remainder 0\n     - 214 ÷ 2 = 107 remainder 0\n     - 107 ÷ 2 = 53 remainder 1\n     - 53 ÷ 2 = 26 remainder 1\n     - 26 ÷ 2 = 13 remainder 0\n     - 13 ÷ 2 = 6 remainder 1\n     - 6 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 0\n     - 3 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 1\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 112449972 is: `11010110011111111111111100`.\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, count the number of 1s in the binary representation `11010110011111111111111100`.\n   - The binary string has the following 1s: `1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0`.\n   - Count the 1s: There are 18 ones in this binary representation.\n\nTherefore, the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 112449972 is 18.\n\nFinal answer: <<<18>>>"
