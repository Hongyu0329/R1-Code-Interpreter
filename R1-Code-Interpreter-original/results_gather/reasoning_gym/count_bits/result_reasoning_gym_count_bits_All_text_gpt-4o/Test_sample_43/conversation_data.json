    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 968,182,547, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Decimal Number to Binary:**\n   - The first step is to convert the decimal number 968,182,547 into its binary form. This involves dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder, then continuing with the quotient until the quotient is 0. The binary representation is the sequence of remainders read from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 968,182,547 and divide by 2:\n     - 968,182,547 ÷ 2 = 484,091,273 remainder 1\n     - 484,091,273 ÷ 2 = 242,045,636 remainder 1\n     - 242,045,636 ÷ 2 = 121,022,818 remainder 0\n     - 121,022,818 ÷ 2 = 60,511,409 remainder 0\n     - 60,511,409 ÷ 2 = 30,255,704 remainder 1\n     - 30,255,704 ÷ 2 = 15,127,852 remainder 0\n     - 15,127,852 ÷ 2 = 7,563,926 remainder 0\n     - 7,563,926 ÷ 2 = 3,781,963 remainder 0\n     - 3,781,963 ÷ 2 = 1,890,981 remainder 1\n     - 1,890,981 ÷ 2 = 945,490 remainder 1\n     - 945,490 ÷ 2 = 472,745 remainder 0\n     - 472,745 ÷ 2 = 236,372 remainder 1\n     - 236,372 ÷ 2 = 118,186 remainder 0\n     - 118,186 ÷ 2 = 59,093 remainder 0\n     - 59,093 ÷ 2 = 29,546 remainder 1\n     - 29,546 ÷ 2 = 14,773 remainder 0\n     - 14,773 ÷ 2 = 7,386 remainder 1\n     - 7,386 ÷ 2 = 3,693 remainder 0\n     - 3,693 ÷ 2 = 1,846 remainder 1\n     - 1,846 ÷ 2 = 923 remainder 0\n     - 923 ÷ 2 = 461 remainder 1\n     - 461 ÷ 2 = 230 remainder 1\n     - 230 ÷ 2 = 115 remainder 0\n     - 115 ÷ 2 = 57 remainder 1\n     - 57 ÷ 2 = 28 remainder 1\n     - 28 ÷ 2 = 14 remainder 0\n     - 14 ÷ 2 = 7 remainder 0\n     - 7 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 1\n     - 3 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 1\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 968,182,547 is: \n     1110011101101101011011101100011\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, count the number of 1s in the binary representation:\n     - 1110011101101101011011101100011\n     - Count each 1: There are 20 ones in this binary string.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 968,182,547 is 20.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<20>>>"
