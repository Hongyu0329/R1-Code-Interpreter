    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 1953714563, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - The first step is to convert the decimal number 1953714563 into its binary form. This involves dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder, then continuing with the quotient until the quotient is 0. The binary representation is the sequence of remainders read in reverse order.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 1953714563 and divide by 2:\n     - 1953714563 ÷ 2 = 976857281 remainder 1\n     - 976857281 ÷ 2 = 488428640 remainder 1\n     - 488428640 ÷ 2 = 244214320 remainder 0\n     - 244214320 ÷ 2 = 122107160 remainder 0\n     - 122107160 ÷ 2 = 61053580 remainder 0\n     - 61053580 ÷ 2 = 30526790 remainder 0\n     - 30526790 ÷ 2 = 15263395 remainder 0\n     - 15263395 ÷ 2 = 7631697 remainder 1\n     - 7631697 ÷ 2 = 3815848 remainder 1\n     - 3815848 ÷ 2 = 1907924 remainder 0\n     - 1907924 ÷ 2 = 953962 remainder 0\n     - 953962 ÷ 2 = 476981 remainder 0\n     - 476981 ÷ 2 = 238490 remainder 1\n     - 238490 ÷ 2 = 119245 remainder 0\n     - 119245 ÷ 2 = 59622 remainder 1\n     - 59622 ÷ 2 = 29811 remainder 0\n     - 29811 ÷ 2 = 14905 remainder 1\n     - 14905 ÷ 2 = 7452 remainder 1\n     - 7452 ÷ 2 = 3726 remainder 0\n     - 3726 ÷ 2 = 1863 remainder 0\n     - 1863 ÷ 2 = 931 remainder 1\n     - 931 ÷ 2 = 465 remainder 1\n     - 465 ÷ 2 = 232 remainder 1\n     - 232 ÷ 2 = 116 remainder 0\n     - 116 ÷ 2 = 58 remainder 0\n     - 58 ÷ 2 = 29 remainder 0\n     - 29 ÷ 2 = 14 remainder 1\n     - 14 ÷ 2 = 7 remainder 0\n     - 7 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 1\n     - 3 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 1\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 1953714563 is: `1110100101101010000000000010011`.\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, count the number of 1s in the binary representation:\n     - `1110100101101010000000000010011` contains 13 ones.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 1953714563 is 13.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<13>>>"
