    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 1135880091, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, convert the decimal number 1135880091 to its binary form. This can be done by repeatedly dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder. The binary representation is constructed by reading the remainders from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 1135880091 and divide by 2:\n     - 1135880091 ÷ 2 = 567940045 remainder 1\n     - 567940045 ÷ 2 = 283970022 remainder 1\n     - 283970022 ÷ 2 = 141985011 remainder 0\n     - 141985011 ÷ 2 = 70992505 remainder 1\n     - 70992505 ÷ 2 = 35496252 remainder 1\n     - 35496252 ÷ 2 = 17748126 remainder 0\n     - 17748126 ÷ 2 = 8874063 remainder 0\n     - 8874063 ÷ 2 = 4437031 remainder 1\n     - 4437031 ÷ 2 = 2218515 remainder 1\n     - 2218515 ÷ 2 = 1109257 remainder 1\n     - 1109257 ÷ 2 = 554628 remainder 1\n     - 554628 ÷ 2 = 277314 remainder 0\n     - 277314 ÷ 2 = 138657 remainder 0\n     - 138657 ÷ 2 = 69328 remainder 1\n     - 69328 ÷ 2 = 34664 remainder 0\n     - 34664 ÷ 2 = 17332 remainder 0\n     - 17332 ÷ 2 = 8666 remainder 0\n     - 8666 ÷ 2 = 4333 remainder 0\n     - 4333 ÷ 2 = 2166 remainder 1\n     - 2166 ÷ 2 = 1083 remainder 0\n     - 1083 ÷ 2 = 541 remainder 1\n     - 541 ÷ 2 = 270 remainder 1\n     - 270 ÷ 2 = 135 remainder 0\n     - 135 ÷ 2 = 67 remainder 1\n     - 67 ÷ 2 = 33 remainder 1\n     - 33 ÷ 2 = 16 remainder 1\n     - 16 ÷ 2 = 8 remainder 0\n     - 8 ÷ 2 = 4 remainder 0\n     - 4 ÷ 2 = 2 remainder 0\n     - 2 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 0\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 1135880091 is: `1000011111101101101011111101011`.\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, count the number of 1s in the binary representation `1000011111101101101011111101011`.\n\n4. **Perform the Count:**\n   - The binary string `1000011111101101101011111101011` contains 20 ones.\n\nTherefore, the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 1135880091 is 20.\n\nFinal answer: <<<20>>>."
