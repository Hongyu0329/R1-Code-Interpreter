    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 280290061, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - The first step is to convert the decimal number 280290061 into its binary form. This involves dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder, then continuing with the quotient until the quotient is 0. The binary representation is the sequence of remainders read from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 280290061 and divide by 2:\n     - 280290061 ÷ 2 = 140145030 remainder 1\n     - 140145030 ÷ 2 = 70072515 remainder 0\n     - 70072515 ÷ 2 = 35036257 remainder 1\n     - 35036257 ÷ 2 = 17518128 remainder 1\n     - 17518128 ÷ 2 = 8759064 remainder 0\n     - 8759064 ÷ 2 = 4379532 remainder 0\n     - 4379532 ÷ 2 = 2189766 remainder 0\n     - 2189766 ÷ 2 = 1094883 remainder 0\n     - 1094883 ÷ 2 = 547441 remainder 1\n     - 547441 ÷ 2 = 273720 remainder 1\n     - 273720 ÷ 2 = 136860 remainder 0\n     - 136860 ÷ 2 = 68430 remainder 0\n     - 68430 ÷ 2 = 34215 remainder 0\n     - 34215 ÷ 2 = 17107 remainder 1\n     - 17107 ÷ 2 = 8553 remainder 1\n     - 8553 ÷ 2 = 4276 remainder 1\n     - 4276 ÷ 2 = 2138 remainder 0\n     - 2138 ÷ 2 = 1069 remainder 0\n     - 1069 ÷ 2 = 534 remainder 1\n     - 534 ÷ 2 = 267 remainder 0\n     - 267 ÷ 2 = 133 remainder 1\n     - 133 ÷ 2 = 66 remainder 1\n     - 66 ÷ 2 = 33 remainder 0\n     - 33 ÷ 2 = 16 remainder 1\n     - 16 ÷ 2 = 8 remainder 0\n     - 8 ÷ 2 = 4 remainder 0\n     - 4 ÷ 2 = 2 remainder 0\n     - 2 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 0\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 280290061 is: 1000010110110111111011011101.\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, count the number of 1s in the binary representation:\n     - 1000010110110111111011011101\n     - Count each '1': there are 18 ones in this binary string.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 280290061 is 18.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<18>>>"
