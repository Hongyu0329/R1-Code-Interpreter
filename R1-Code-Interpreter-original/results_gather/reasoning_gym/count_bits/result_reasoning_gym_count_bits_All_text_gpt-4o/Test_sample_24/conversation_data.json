    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 2074295653, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, we need to convert the decimal number 2074295653 into its binary form. This involves dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder, then repeating the process with the quotient until the quotient is zero. The binary representation is the sequence of remainders read in reverse order.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Let's perform the conversion:\n     - 2074295653 ÷ 2 = 1037147826 remainder 1\n     - 1037147826 ÷ 2 = 518573913 remainder 0\n     - 518573913 ÷ 2 = 259286956 remainder 1\n     - 259286956 ÷ 2 = 129643478 remainder 0\n     - 129643478 ÷ 2 = 64821739 remainder 0\n     - 64821739 ÷ 2 = 32410869 remainder 1\n     - 32410869 ÷ 2 = 16205434 remainder 1\n     - 16205434 ÷ 2 = 8102717 remainder 0\n     - 8102717 ÷ 2 = 4051358 remainder 1\n     - 4051358 ÷ 2 = 2025679 remainder 0\n     - 2025679 ÷ 2 = 1012839 remainder 1\n     - 1012839 ÷ 2 = 506419 remainder 1\n     - 506419 ÷ 2 = 253209 remainder 1\n     - 253209 ÷ 2 = 126604 remainder 1\n     - 126604 ÷ 2 = 63302 remainder 0\n     - 63302 ÷ 2 = 31651 remainder 0\n     - 31651 ÷ 2 = 15825 remainder 1\n     - 15825 ÷ 2 = 7912 remainder 1\n     - 7912 ÷ 2 = 3956 remainder 0\n     - 3956 ÷ 2 = 1978 remainder 0\n     - 1978 ÷ 2 = 989 remainder 0\n     - 989 ÷ 2 = 494 remainder 1\n     - 494 ÷ 2 = 247 remainder 0\n     - 247 ÷ 2 = 123 remainder 1\n     - 123 ÷ 2 = 61 remainder 1\n     - 61 ÷ 2 = 30 remainder 1\n     - 30 ÷ 2 = 15 remainder 0\n     - 15 ÷ 2 = 7 remainder 1\n     - 7 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 1\n     - 3 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 1\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 2074295653 is: \n     1111011101011100001011011100101\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, we need to count the number of 1s in the binary representation.\n   - The binary number 1111011101011100001011011100101 contains 19 ones.\n\nTherefore, the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 2074295653 is 19.\n\nFinal answer: <<<19>>>"
