    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 1022542093, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, convert the decimal number 1022542093 into its binary form. This can be done using the division-by-2 method, where you repeatedly divide the number by 2 and record the remainder. The binary representation is formed by the remainders read in reverse order.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 1022542093 and divide by 2:\n     - 1022542093 ÷ 2 = 511271046 with a remainder of 1\n     - 511271046 ÷ 2 = 255635523 with a remainder of 0\n     - 255635523 ÷ 2 = 127817761 with a remainder of 1\n     - 127817761 ÷ 2 = 63908880 with a remainder of 1\n     - 63908880 ÷ 2 = 31954440 with a remainder of 0\n     - 31954440 ÷ 2 = 15977220 with a remainder of 0\n     - 15977220 ÷ 2 = 7988610 with a remainder of 0\n     - 7988610 ÷ 2 = 3994305 with a remainder of 0\n     - 3994305 ÷ 2 = 1997152 with a remainder of 1\n     - 1997152 ÷ 2 = 998576 with a remainder of 0\n     - 998576 ÷ 2 = 499288 with a remainder of 0\n     - 499288 ÷ 2 = 249644 with a remainder of 0\n     - 249644 ÷ 2 = 124822 with a remainder of 0\n     - 124822 ÷ 2 = 62411 with a remainder of 0\n     - 62411 ÷ 2 = 31205 with a remainder of 1\n     - 31205 ÷ 2 = 15602 with a remainder of 1\n     - 15602 ÷ 2 = 7801 with a remainder of 0\n     - 7801 ÷ 2 = 3900 with a remainder of 1\n     - 3900 ÷ 2 = 1950 with a remainder of 0\n     - 1950 ÷ 2 = 975 with a remainder of 0\n     - 975 ÷ 2 = 487 with a remainder of 1\n     - 487 ÷ 2 = 243 with a remainder of 1\n     - 243 ÷ 2 = 121 with a remainder of 1\n     - 121 ÷ 2 = 60 with a remainder of 1\n     - 60 ÷ 2 = 30 with a remainder of 0\n     - 30 ÷ 2 = 15 with a remainder of 0\n     - 15 ÷ 2 = 7 with a remainder of 1\n     - 7 ÷ 2 = 3 with a remainder of 1\n     - 3 ÷ 2 = 1 with a remainder of 1\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 with a remainder of 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 1022542093 is: `111100111111111111111111110101`\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, count the number of 1s in the binary representation `111100111111111111111111110101`.\n   - The binary string has 26 ones.\n\nTherefore, the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 1022542093 is 26.\n\nFinal answer: <<<26>>>"
