    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 755584081, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, we need to convert the decimal number 755584081 into its binary form. This involves dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder, then continuing with the quotient until the quotient is 0. The binary representation is the sequence of remainders read in reverse order.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 755584081 and divide by 2:\n     - 755584081 ÷ 2 = 377792040 remainder 1\n     - 377792040 ÷ 2 = 188896020 remainder 0\n     - 188896020 ÷ 2 = 94448010 remainder 0\n     - 94448010 ÷ 2 = 47224005 remainder 0\n     - 47224005 ÷ 2 = 23612002 remainder 1\n     - 23612002 ÷ 2 = 11806001 remainder 0\n     - 11806001 ÷ 2 = 5903000 remainder 1\n     - 5903000 ÷ 2 = 2951500 remainder 0\n     - 2951500 ÷ 2 = 1475750 remainder 0\n     - 1475750 ÷ 2 = 737875 remainder 0\n     - 737875 ÷ 2 = 368937 remainder 1\n     - 368937 ÷ 2 = 184468 remainder 1\n     - 184468 ÷ 2 = 92234 remainder 0\n     - 92234 ÷ 2 = 46117 remainder 0\n     - 46117 ÷ 2 = 23058 remainder 1\n     - 23058 ÷ 2 = 11529 remainder 0\n     - 11529 ÷ 2 = 5764 remainder 1\n     - 5764 ÷ 2 = 2882 remainder 0\n     - 2882 ÷ 2 = 1441 remainder 0\n     - 1441 ÷ 2 = 720 remainder 1\n     - 720 ÷ 2 = 360 remainder 0\n     - 360 ÷ 2 = 180 remainder 0\n     - 180 ÷ 2 = 90 remainder 0\n     - 90 ÷ 2 = 45 remainder 0\n     - 45 ÷ 2 = 22 remainder 1\n     - 22 ÷ 2 = 11 remainder 0\n     - 11 ÷ 2 = 5 remainder 1\n     - 5 ÷ 2 = 2 remainder 1\n     - 2 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 0\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 755584081 is: `1011000011111111111111110000001`.\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, we need to count the number of 1s in the binary representation `1011000011111111111111110000001`.\n   - By counting, we find there are 19 ones.\n\nTherefore, the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 755584081 is 19.\n\n<<<19>>>"
