    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 91409179, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Decimal Number to Binary:**\n   - The first step is to convert the decimal number 91409179 into its binary form. This involves dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder, then continuing with the quotient until the quotient is 0. The binary representation is the sequence of remainders read in reverse order.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 91409179 and divide by 2:\n     - 91409179 ÷ 2 = 45704589 remainder 1\n     - 45704589 ÷ 2 = 22852294 remainder 1\n     - 22852294 ÷ 2 = 11426147 remainder 0\n     - 11426147 ÷ 2 = 5713073 remainder 1\n     - 5713073 ÷ 2 = 2856536 remainder 1\n     - 2856536 ÷ 2 = 1428268 remainder 0\n     - 1428268 ÷ 2 = 714134 remainder 0\n     - 714134 ÷ 2 = 357067 remainder 0\n     - 357067 ÷ 2 = 178533 remainder 1\n     - 178533 ÷ 2 = 89266 remainder 1\n     - 89266 ÷ 2 = 44633 remainder 0\n     - 44633 ÷ 2 = 22316 remainder 1\n     - 22316 ÷ 2 = 11158 remainder 0\n     - 11158 ÷ 2 = 5579 remainder 0\n     - 5579 ÷ 2 = 2789 remainder 1\n     - 2789 ÷ 2 = 1394 remainder 1\n     - 1394 ÷ 2 = 697 remainder 0\n     - 697 ÷ 2 = 348 remainder 1\n     - 348 ÷ 2 = 174 remainder 0\n     - 174 ÷ 2 = 87 remainder 0\n     - 87 ÷ 2 = 43 remainder 1\n     - 43 ÷ 2 = 21 remainder 1\n     - 21 ÷ 2 = 10 remainder 1\n     - 10 ÷ 2 = 5 remainder 0\n     - 5 ÷ 2 = 2 remainder 1\n     - 2 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 0\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 91409179 is: \n     1010111001101101010111101011\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, count the number of 1s in the binary representation:\n     - 1010111001101101010111101011\n     - Count each 1: There are 18 ones in this binary number.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 91409179 is 18.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<18>>>"
