    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 2101001059, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Decimal Number to Binary:**\n   - The first step is to convert the decimal number 2101001059 into its binary form. This involves dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder, then continuing with the quotient until the quotient is 0. The binary representation is the sequence of remainders read in reverse order.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 2101001059 and divide by 2:\n     - 2101001059 ÷ 2 = 1050500529 remainder 1\n     - 1050500529 ÷ 2 = 525250264 remainder 1\n     - 525250264 ÷ 2 = 262625132 remainder 0\n     - 262625132 ÷ 2 = 131312566 remainder 0\n     - 131312566 ÷ 2 = 65656283 remainder 0\n     - 65656283 ÷ 2 = 32828141 remainder 1\n     - 32828141 ÷ 2 = 16414070 remainder 1\n     - 16414070 ÷ 2 = 8207035 remainder 0\n     - 8207035 ÷ 2 = 4103517 remainder 1\n     - 4103517 ÷ 2 = 2051758 remainder 1\n     - 2051758 ÷ 2 = 1025879 remainder 0\n     - 1025879 ÷ 2 = 512939 remainder 1\n     - 512939 ÷ 2 = 256469 remainder 1\n     - 256469 ÷ 2 = 128234 remainder 1\n     - 128234 ÷ 2 = 64117 remainder 0\n     - 64117 ÷ 2 = 32058 remainder 1\n     - 32058 ÷ 2 = 16029 remainder 0\n     - 16029 ÷ 2 = 8014 remainder 1\n     - 8014 ÷ 2 = 4007 remainder 0\n     - 4007 ÷ 2 = 2003 remainder 1\n     - 2003 ÷ 2 = 1001 remainder 1\n     - 1001 ÷ 2 = 500 remainder 1\n     - 500 ÷ 2 = 250 remainder 0\n     - 250 ÷ 2 = 125 remainder 0\n     - 125 ÷ 2 = 62 remainder 1\n     - 62 ÷ 2 = 31 remainder 0\n     - 31 ÷ 2 = 15 remainder 1\n     - 15 ÷ 2 = 7 remainder 1\n     - 7 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 1\n     - 3 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 1\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 2101001059 is:\n     - 1111101001101011101101101100011\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, count the number of 1s in the binary representation:\n     - 1111101001101011101101101100011\n     - There are 22 ones in this binary string.\n\nTherefore, the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 2101001059 is 22.\n\n<<<22>>>"
