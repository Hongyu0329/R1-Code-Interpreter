    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 1095256416, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, we need to convert the decimal number 1095256416 into its binary form. This can be done by repeatedly dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder. The binary representation is constructed by reading the remainders from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 1095256416 and divide by 2:\n     - 1095256416 ÷ 2 = 547628208 remainder 0\n     - 547628208 ÷ 2 = 273814104 remainder 0\n     - 273814104 ÷ 2 = 136907052 remainder 0\n     - 136907052 ÷ 2 = 68453526 remainder 0\n     - 68453526 ÷ 2 = 34226763 remainder 0\n     - 34226763 ÷ 2 = 17113381 remainder 1\n     - 17113381 ÷ 2 = 8556690 remainder 1\n     - 8556690 ÷ 2 = 4278345 remainder 0\n     - 4278345 ÷ 2 = 2139172 remainder 1\n     - 2139172 ÷ 2 = 1069586 remainder 0\n     - 1069586 ÷ 2 = 534793 remainder 0\n     - 534793 ÷ 2 = 267396 remainder 1\n     - 267396 ÷ 2 = 133698 remainder 0\n     - 133698 ÷ 2 = 66849 remainder 0\n     - 66849 ÷ 2 = 33424 remainder 1\n     - 33424 ÷ 2 = 16712 remainder 0\n     - 16712 ÷ 2 = 8356 remainder 0\n     - 8356 ÷ 2 = 4178 remainder 0\n     - 4178 ÷ 2 = 2089 remainder 0\n     - 2089 ÷ 2 = 1044 remainder 1\n     - 1044 ÷ 2 = 522 remainder 0\n     - 522 ÷ 2 = 261 remainder 0\n     - 261 ÷ 2 = 130 remainder 1\n     - 130 ÷ 2 = 65 remainder 0\n     - 65 ÷ 2 = 32 remainder 1\n     - 32 ÷ 2 = 16 remainder 0\n     - 16 ÷ 2 = 8 remainder 0\n     - 8 ÷ 2 = 4 remainder 0\n     - 4 ÷ 2 = 2 remainder 0\n     - 2 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 0\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 1095256416 is: `1000001010000000100000000000000`.\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, we need to count the number of 1s in the binary representation `1000001010000000100000000000000`.\n   - By counting, we find there are 4 ones in this binary string.\n\nTherefore, the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 1095256416 is 4.\n\nFinal answer: <<<4>>>."
