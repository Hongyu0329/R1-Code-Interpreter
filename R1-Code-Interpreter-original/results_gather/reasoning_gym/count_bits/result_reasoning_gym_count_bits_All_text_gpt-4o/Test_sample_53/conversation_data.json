    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 428613486, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, convert the decimal number 428613486 to its binary form. This can be done using the division-by-2 method, where you repeatedly divide the number by 2 and record the remainder. The binary representation is formed by the remainders read in reverse order.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 428613486 and divide by 2:\n     - 428613486 ÷ 2 = 214306743 remainder 0\n     - 214306743 ÷ 2 = 107153371 remainder 1\n     - 107153371 ÷ 2 = 53576685 remainder 1\n     - 53576685 ÷ 2 = 26788342 remainder 1\n     - 26788342 ÷ 2 = 13394171 remainder 0\n     - 13394171 ÷ 2 = 6697085 remainder 1\n     - 6697085 ÷ 2 = 3348542 remainder 1\n     - 3348542 ÷ 2 = 1674271 remainder 0\n     - 1674271 ÷ 2 = 837135 remainder 1\n     - 837135 ÷ 2 = 418567 remainder 1\n     - 418567 ÷ 2 = 209283 remainder 1\n     - 209283 ÷ 2 = 104641 remainder 1\n     - 104641 ÷ 2 = 52320 remainder 1\n     - 52320 ÷ 2 = 26160 remainder 0\n     - 26160 ÷ 2 = 13080 remainder 0\n     - 13080 ÷ 2 = 6540 remainder 0\n     - 6540 ÷ 2 = 3270 remainder 0\n     - 3270 ÷ 2 = 1635 remainder 0\n     - 1635 ÷ 2 = 817 remainder 1\n     - 817 ÷ 2 = 408 remainder 1\n     - 408 ÷ 2 = 204 remainder 0\n     - 204 ÷ 2 = 102 remainder 0\n     - 102 ÷ 2 = 51 remainder 0\n     - 51 ÷ 2 = 25 remainder 1\n     - 25 ÷ 2 = 12 remainder 1\n     - 12 ÷ 2 = 6 remainder 0\n     - 6 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 0\n     - 3 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 1\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 428613486 is: \n     110011001011110111101111000111110\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, count the number of 1s in the binary representation:\n     - 110011001011110111101111000111110\n     - Count each 1: There are 20 ones in this binary string.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 428613486 is 20.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<20>>>"
