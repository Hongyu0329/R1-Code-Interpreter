    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 1373158607, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, we need to convert the decimal number 1373158607 into its binary form. This can be done by repeatedly dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder. The binary representation is constructed by reading the remainders from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 1373158607 and divide by 2:\n     - 1373158607 ÷ 2 = 686579303 remainder 1\n     - 686579303 ÷ 2 = 343289651 remainder 1\n     - 343289651 ÷ 2 = 171644825 remainder 1\n     - 171644825 ÷ 2 = 85822412 remainder 1\n     - 85822412 ÷ 2 = 42911206 remainder 0\n     - 42911206 ÷ 2 = 21455603 remainder 0\n     - 21455603 ÷ 2 = 10727801 remainder 1\n     - 10727801 ÷ 2 = 5363900 remainder 1\n     - 5363900 ÷ 2 = 2681950 remainder 0\n     - 2681950 ÷ 2 = 1340975 remainder 0\n     - 1340975 ÷ 2 = 670487 remainder 1\n     - 670487 ÷ 2 = 335243 remainder 1\n     - 335243 ÷ 2 = 167621 remainder 1\n     - 167621 ÷ 2 = 83810 remainder 1\n     - 83810 ÷ 2 = 41905 remainder 0\n     - 41905 ÷ 2 = 20952 remainder 1\n     - 20952 ÷ 2 = 10476 remainder 0\n     - 10476 ÷ 2 = 5238 remainder 0\n     - 5238 ÷ 2 = 2619 remainder 0\n     - 2619 ÷ 2 = 1309 remainder 1\n     - 1309 ÷ 2 = 654 remainder 1\n     - 654 ÷ 2 = 327 remainder 0\n     - 327 ÷ 2 = 163 remainder 1\n     - 163 ÷ 2 = 81 remainder 1\n     - 81 ÷ 2 = 40 remainder 1\n     - 40 ÷ 2 = 20 remainder 0\n     - 20 ÷ 2 = 10 remainder 0\n     - 10 ÷ 2 = 5 remainder 0\n     - 5 ÷ 2 = 2 remainder 1\n     - 2 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 0\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 1373158607 is:\n     - 1010010001101101011111111111111\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, we need to count the number of 1s in the binary representation.\n   - The binary number 1010010001101101011111111111111 contains 21 ones.\n\nTherefore, the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 1373158607 is 21.\n\nFinal answer: <<<21>>>."
