    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 1749078507, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, we need to convert the decimal number 1749078507 into its binary form. This involves dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder, then repeating the process with the quotient until the quotient is 0. The binary representation is the sequence of remainders read in reverse order.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 1749078507:\n     - 1749078507 ÷ 2 = 874539253 remainder 1\n     - 874539253 ÷ 2 = 437269626 remainder 1\n     - 437269626 ÷ 2 = 218634813 remainder 0\n     - 218634813 ÷ 2 = 109317406 remainder 1\n     - 109317406 ÷ 2 = 54658703 remainder 0\n     - 54658703 ÷ 2 = 27329351 remainder 1\n     - 27329351 ÷ 2 = 13664675 remainder 1\n     - 13664675 ÷ 2 = 6832337 remainder 1\n     - 6832337 ÷ 2 = 3416168 remainder 1\n     - 3416168 ÷ 2 = 1708084 remainder 0\n     - 1708084 ÷ 2 = 854042 remainder 0\n     - 854042 ÷ 2 = 427021 remainder 0\n     - 427021 ÷ 2 = 213510 remainder 1\n     - 213510 ÷ 2 = 106755 remainder 0\n     - 106755 ÷ 2 = 53377 remainder 1\n     - 53377 ÷ 2 = 26688 remainder 1\n     - 26688 ÷ 2 = 13344 remainder 0\n     - 13344 ÷ 2 = 6672 remainder 0\n     - 6672 ÷ 2 = 3336 remainder 0\n     - 3336 ÷ 2 = 1668 remainder 0\n     - 1668 ÷ 2 = 834 remainder 0\n     - 834 ÷ 2 = 417 remainder 0\n     - 417 ÷ 2 = 208 remainder 1\n     - 208 ÷ 2 = 104 remainder 0\n     - 104 ÷ 2 = 52 remainder 0\n     - 52 ÷ 2 = 26 remainder 0\n     - 26 ÷ 2 = 13 remainder 0\n     - 13 ÷ 2 = 6 remainder 1\n     - 6 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 0\n     - 3 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 1\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 1749078507 is: \n     1101000001101101011101010101011\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, we count the number of 1s in the binary representation:\n     - 1101000001101101011101010101011\n     - Count the 1s: There are 17 ones in this binary string.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 1749078507 is 17.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<17>>>"
