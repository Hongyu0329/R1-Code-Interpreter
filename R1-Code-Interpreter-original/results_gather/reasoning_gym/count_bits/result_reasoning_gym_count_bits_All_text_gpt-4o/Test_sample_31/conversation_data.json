    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 955929203, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, we need to convert the decimal number 955929203 into its binary form. This involves dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder, then continuing with the quotient until the quotient is 0. The binary representation is the sequence of remainders read in reverse order.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 955929203:\n     - 955929203 ÷ 2 = 477964601 remainder 1\n     - 477964601 ÷ 2 = 238982300 remainder 1\n     - 238982300 ÷ 2 = 119491150 remainder 0\n     - 119491150 ÷ 2 = 59745575 remainder 0\n     - 59745575 ÷ 2 = 29872787 remainder 1\n     - 29872787 ÷ 2 = 14936393 remainder 1\n     - 14936393 ÷ 2 = 7468196 remainder 1\n     - 7468196 ÷ 2 = 3734098 remainder 0\n     - 3734098 ÷ 2 = 1867049 remainder 0\n     - 1867049 ÷ 2 = 933524 remainder 1\n     - 933524 ÷ 2 = 466762 remainder 0\n     - 466762 ÷ 2 = 233381 remainder 0\n     - 233381 ÷ 2 = 116690 remainder 1\n     - 116690 ÷ 2 = 58345 remainder 0\n     - 58345 ÷ 2 = 29172 remainder 1\n     - 29172 ÷ 2 = 14586 remainder 0\n     - 14586 ÷ 2 = 7293 remainder 0\n     - 7293 ÷ 2 = 3646 remainder 1\n     - 3646 ÷ 2 = 1823 remainder 0\n     - 1823 ÷ 2 = 911 remainder 1\n     - 911 ÷ 2 = 455 remainder 1\n     - 455 ÷ 2 = 227 remainder 1\n     - 227 ÷ 2 = 113 remainder 1\n     - 113 ÷ 2 = 56 remainder 1\n     - 56 ÷ 2 = 28 remainder 0\n     - 28 ÷ 2 = 14 remainder 0\n     - 14 ÷ 2 = 7 remainder 0\n     - 7 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 1\n     - 3 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 1\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 955929203 is: \n     111001000110110111110110110011\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, we count the number of 1s in the binary representation:\n     - 111001000110110111110110110011\n     - Count the 1s: There are 19 ones in this binary number.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 955929203 is 19.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<19>>>"
