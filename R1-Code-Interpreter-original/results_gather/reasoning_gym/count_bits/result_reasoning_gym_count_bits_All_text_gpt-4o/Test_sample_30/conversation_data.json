    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 1992846719, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, convert the decimal number 1992846719 into its binary form. This can be done by repeatedly dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder. The binary representation is constructed by reading the remainders from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 1992846719 and divide by 2:\n     - 1992846719 ÷ 2 = 996423359 remainder 1\n     - 996423359 ÷ 2 = 498211679 remainder 1\n     - 498211679 ÷ 2 = 249105839 remainder 1\n     - 249105839 ÷ 2 = 124552919 remainder 1\n     - 124552919 ÷ 2 = 62276459 remainder 1\n     - 62276459 ÷ 2 = 31138229 remainder 1\n     - 31138229 ÷ 2 = 15569114 remainder 1\n     - 15569114 ÷ 2 = 7784557 remainder 0\n     - 7784557 ÷ 2 = 3892278 remainder 1\n     - 3892278 ÷ 2 = 1946139 remainder 0\n     - 1946139 ÷ 2 = 973069 remainder 1\n     - 973069 ÷ 2 = 486534 remainder 1\n     - 486534 ÷ 2 = 243267 remainder 0\n     - 243267 ÷ 2 = 121633 remainder 1\n     - 121633 ÷ 2 = 60816 remainder 1\n     - 60816 ÷ 2 = 30408 remainder 0\n     - 30408 ÷ 2 = 15204 remainder 0\n     - 15204 ÷ 2 = 7602 remainder 0\n     - 7602 ÷ 2 = 3801 remainder 0\n     - 3801 ÷ 2 = 1900 remainder 1\n     - 1900 ÷ 2 = 950 remainder 0\n     - 950 ÷ 2 = 475 remainder 0\n     - 475 ÷ 2 = 237 remainder 1\n     - 237 ÷ 2 = 118 remainder 1\n     - 118 ÷ 2 = 59 remainder 0\n     - 59 ÷ 2 = 29 remainder 1\n     - 29 ÷ 2 = 14 remainder 1\n     - 14 ÷ 2 = 7 remainder 0\n     - 7 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 1\n     - 3 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 1\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 1992846719 is: \n     `1110111011101110111011101111111`.\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, count the number of 1s in the binary representation:\n     - The binary string `1110111011101110111011101111111` contains 26 ones.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 1992846719 is 26.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<26>>>"
