    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 515617340, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, we need to convert the decimal number 515617340 into its binary form. This involves dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder, then continuing with the quotient until the quotient is 0. The binary representation is the sequence of remainders read from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Let's perform the conversion:\n     - 515617340 ÷ 2 = 257808670 remainder 0\n     - 257808670 ÷ 2 = 128904335 remainder 0\n     - 128904335 ÷ 2 = 64452167 remainder 1\n     - 64452167 ÷ 2 = 32226083 remainder 1\n     - 32226083 ÷ 2 = 16113041 remainder 1\n     - 16113041 ÷ 2 = 8056520 remainder 1\n     - 8056520 ÷ 2 = 4028260 remainder 0\n     - 4028260 ÷ 2 = 2014130 remainder 0\n     - 2014130 ÷ 2 = 1007065 remainder 0\n     - 1007065 ÷ 2 = 503532 remainder 1\n     - 503532 ÷ 2 = 251766 remainder 0\n     - 251766 ÷ 2 = 125883 remainder 0\n     - 125883 ÷ 2 = 62941 remainder 1\n     - 62941 ÷ 2 = 31470 remainder 1\n     - 31470 ÷ 2 = 15735 remainder 0\n     - 15735 ÷ 2 = 7867 remainder 1\n     - 7867 ÷ 2 = 3933 remainder 1\n     - 3933 ÷ 2 = 1966 remainder 1\n     - 1966 ÷ 2 = 983 remainder 0\n     - 983 ÷ 2 = 491 remainder 1\n     - 491 ÷ 2 = 245 remainder 1\n     - 245 ÷ 2 = 122 remainder 1\n     - 122 ÷ 2 = 61 remainder 0\n     - 61 ÷ 2 = 30 remainder 1\n     - 30 ÷ 2 = 15 remainder 0\n     - 15 ÷ 2 = 7 remainder 1\n     - 7 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 1\n     - 3 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 1\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 515617340 is: \n     111101010101010101010101010100\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, we need to count the number of 1s in the binary representation.\n   - The binary number is: 111101010101010101010101010100\n   - Count the 1s: There are 17 ones in this binary representation.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 515617340 is 17.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<17>>>"
