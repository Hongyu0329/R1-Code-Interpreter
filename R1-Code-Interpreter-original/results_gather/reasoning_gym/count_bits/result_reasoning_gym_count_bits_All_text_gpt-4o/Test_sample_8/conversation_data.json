    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 984850406, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - The first step is to convert the decimal number 984850406 into its binary form. This involves dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder, then continuing with the quotient until the quotient is zero. The binary representation is the sequence of remainders read from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 984850406 and divide by 2:\n     - 984850406 ÷ 2 = 492425203 remainder 0\n     - 492425203 ÷ 2 = 246212601 remainder 1\n     - 246212601 ÷ 2 = 123106300 remainder 1\n     - 123106300 ÷ 2 = 61553150 remainder 0\n     - 61553150 ÷ 2 = 30776575 remainder 0\n     - 30776575 ÷ 2 = 15388287 remainder 1\n     - 15388287 ÷ 2 = 7694143 remainder 1\n     - 7694143 ÷ 2 = 3847071 remainder 1\n     - 3847071 ÷ 2 = 1923535 remainder 1\n     - 1923535 ÷ 2 = 961767 remainder 1\n     - 961767 ÷ 2 = 480883 remainder 1\n     - 480883 ÷ 2 = 240441 remainder 1\n     - 240441 ÷ 2 = 120220 remainder 1\n     - 120220 ÷ 2 = 60110 remainder 0\n     - 60110 ÷ 2 = 30055 remainder 0\n     - 30055 ÷ 2 = 15027 remainder 1\n     - 15027 ÷ 2 = 7513 remainder 1\n     - 7513 ÷ 2 = 3756 remainder 1\n     - 3756 ÷ 2 = 1878 remainder 0\n     - 1878 ÷ 2 = 939 remainder 0\n     - 939 ÷ 2 = 469 remainder 1\n     - 469 ÷ 2 = 234 remainder 1\n     - 234 ÷ 2 = 117 remainder 0\n     - 117 ÷ 2 = 58 remainder 1\n     - 58 ÷ 2 = 29 remainder 0\n     - 29 ÷ 2 = 14 remainder 1\n     - 14 ÷ 2 = 7 remainder 0\n     - 7 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 1\n     - 3 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 1\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 984850406 is: \n     111010110110110110110110110110\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, count the number of 1s in the binary representation:\n     - 111010110110110110110110110110 has 20 ones.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 984850406 is 20.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<20>>>"
