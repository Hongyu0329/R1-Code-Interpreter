    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 65617051, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - The first step is to convert the decimal number 65617051 into its binary form. This involves dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder, then continuing with the quotient until the quotient is 0. The binary representation is the sequence of remainders read from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 65617051:\n     - 65617051 ÷ 2 = 32808525 remainder 1\n     - 32808525 ÷ 2 = 16404262 remainder 1\n     - 16404262 ÷ 2 = 8202131 remainder 0\n     - 8202131 ÷ 2 = 4101065 remainder 1\n     - 4101065 ÷ 2 = 2050532 remainder 1\n     - 2050532 ÷ 2 = 1025266 remainder 0\n     - 1025266 ÷ 2 = 512633 remainder 0\n     - 512633 ÷ 2 = 256316 remainder 1\n     - 256316 ÷ 2 = 128158 remainder 0\n     - 128158 ÷ 2 = 64079 remainder 0\n     - 64079 ÷ 2 = 32039 remainder 1\n     - 32039 ÷ 2 = 16019 remainder 1\n     - 16019 ÷ 2 = 8009 remainder 1\n     - 8009 ÷ 2 = 4004 remainder 1\n     - 4004 ÷ 2 = 2002 remainder 0\n     - 2002 ÷ 2 = 1001 remainder 0\n     - 1001 ÷ 2 = 500 remainder 1\n     - 500 ÷ 2 = 250 remainder 0\n     - 250 ÷ 2 = 125 remainder 0\n     - 125 ÷ 2 = 62 remainder 1\n     - 62 ÷ 2 = 31 remainder 0\n     - 31 ÷ 2 = 15 remainder 1\n     - 15 ÷ 2 = 7 remainder 1\n     - 7 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 1\n     - 3 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 1\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 65617051 is: 1111101011111101111011011011.\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, count the number of 1s in the binary representation:\n     - 1111101011111101111011011011\n     - Count each '1': There are 22 ones in this binary string.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 65617051 is 22.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<22>>>"
