    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 187478517, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - The first step is to convert the decimal number 187478517 into its binary form. This involves dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder, then repeating the process with the quotient until the quotient is zero. The binary representation is the sequence of remainders read in reverse order.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 187478517 and divide by 2:\n     - 187478517 ÷ 2 = 93739258 remainder 1\n     - 93739258 ÷ 2 = 46869629 remainder 0\n     - 46869629 ÷ 2 = 23434814 remainder 1\n     - 23434814 ÷ 2 = 11717407 remainder 0\n     - 11717407 ÷ 2 = 5858703 remainder 1\n     - 5858703 ÷ 2 = 2929351 remainder 1\n     - 2929351 ÷ 2 = 1464675 remainder 1\n     - 1464675 ÷ 2 = 732337 remainder 1\n     - 732337 ÷ 2 = 366168 remainder 1\n     - 366168 ÷ 2 = 183084 remainder 0\n     - 183084 ÷ 2 = 91542 remainder 0\n     - 91542 ÷ 2 = 45771 remainder 0\n     - 45771 ÷ 2 = 22885 remainder 1\n     - 22885 ÷ 2 = 11442 remainder 1\n     - 11442 ÷ 2 = 5721 remainder 0\n     - 5721 ÷ 2 = 2860 remainder 1\n     - 2860 ÷ 2 = 1430 remainder 0\n     - 1430 ÷ 2 = 715 remainder 0\n     - 715 ÷ 2 = 357 remainder 1\n     - 357 ÷ 2 = 178 remainder 1\n     - 178 ÷ 2 = 89 remainder 0\n     - 89 ÷ 2 = 44 remainder 1\n     - 44 ÷ 2 = 22 remainder 0\n     - 22 ÷ 2 = 11 remainder 0\n     - 11 ÷ 2 = 5 remainder 1\n     - 5 ÷ 2 = 2 remainder 1\n     - 2 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 0\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 187478517 is: 101100101100110110110110010101.\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, count the number of 1s in the binary representation:\n     - 101100101100110110110110010101\n     - Count each '1': there are 18 ones.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 187478517 is 18.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<18>>>"
