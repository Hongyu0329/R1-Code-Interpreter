    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 174140877, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - The first step is to convert the decimal number 174140877 into its binary form. This involves dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder, then continuing with the quotient until the quotient is zero. The binary representation is the sequence of remainders read in reverse order.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Let's perform the conversion:\n     - 174140877 ÷ 2 = 87070438 remainder 1\n     - 87070438 ÷ 2 = 43535219 remainder 0\n     - 43535219 ÷ 2 = 21767609 remainder 1\n     - 21767609 ÷ 2 = 10883804 remainder 1\n     - 10883804 ÷ 2 = 5441902 remainder 0\n     - 5441902 ÷ 2 = 2720951 remainder 0\n     - 2720951 ÷ 2 = 1360475 remainder 1\n     - 1360475 ÷ 2 = 680237 remainder 1\n     - 680237 ÷ 2 = 340118 remainder 1\n     - 340118 ÷ 2 = 170059 remainder 0\n     - 170059 ÷ 2 = 85029 remainder 1\n     - 85029 ÷ 2 = 42514 remainder 1\n     - 42514 ÷ 2 = 21257 remainder 0\n     - 21257 ÷ 2 = 10628 remainder 1\n     - 10628 ÷ 2 = 5314 remainder 0\n     - 5314 ÷ 2 = 2657 remainder 0\n     - 2657 ÷ 2 = 1328 remainder 1\n     - 1328 ÷ 2 = 664 remainder 0\n     - 664 ÷ 2 = 332 remainder 0\n     - 332 ÷ 2 = 166 remainder 0\n     - 166 ÷ 2 = 83 remainder 0\n     - 83 ÷ 2 = 41 remainder 1\n     - 41 ÷ 2 = 20 remainder 1\n     - 20 ÷ 2 = 10 remainder 0\n     - 10 ÷ 2 = 5 remainder 0\n     - 5 ÷ 2 = 2 remainder 1\n     - 2 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 0\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 174140877 is: 1010011001101101011011111101.\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, we need to count the number of 1s in the binary representation.\n   - The binary number 1010011001101101011011111101 contains the following 1s:\n     - 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1\n   - Counting the 1s, we find there are 17 ones.\n\nTherefore, the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 174140877 is 17.\n\nFinal answer: <<<17>>>."
