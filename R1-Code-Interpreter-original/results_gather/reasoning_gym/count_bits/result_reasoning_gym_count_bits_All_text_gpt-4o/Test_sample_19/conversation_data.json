    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 522950408, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, convert the decimal number 522950408 into its binary form. This can be done by repeatedly dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder. The binary representation is constructed by reading the remainders from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 522950408 and divide by 2:\n     - 522950408 ÷ 2 = 261475204 remainder 0\n     - 261475204 ÷ 2 = 130737602 remainder 0\n     - 130737602 ÷ 2 = 65368801 remainder 0\n     - 65368801 ÷ 2 = 32684400 remainder 1\n     - 32684400 ÷ 2 = 16342200 remainder 0\n     - 16342200 ÷ 2 = 8171100 remainder 0\n     - 8171100 ÷ 2 = 4085550 remainder 0\n     - 4085550 ÷ 2 = 2042775 remainder 0\n     - 2042775 ÷ 2 = 1021387 remainder 1\n     - 1021387 ÷ 2 = 510693 remainder 1\n     - 510693 ÷ 2 = 255346 remainder 1\n     - 255346 ÷ 2 = 127673 remainder 0\n     - 127673 ÷ 2 = 63836 remainder 1\n     - 63836 ÷ 2 = 31918 remainder 0\n     - 31918 ÷ 2 = 15959 remainder 0\n     - 15959 ÷ 2 = 7979 remainder 1\n     - 7979 ÷ 2 = 3989 remainder 1\n     - 3989 ÷ 2 = 1994 remainder 1\n     - 1994 ÷ 2 = 997 remainder 0\n     - 997 ÷ 2 = 498 remainder 1\n     - 498 ÷ 2 = 249 remainder 0\n     - 249 ÷ 2 = 124 remainder 1\n     - 124 ÷ 2 = 62 remainder 0\n     - 62 ÷ 2 = 31 remainder 0\n     - 31 ÷ 2 = 15 remainder 1\n     - 15 ÷ 2 = 7 remainder 1\n     - 7 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 1\n     - 3 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 1\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 522950408 is: \n     1111100101111101111101111000\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, count the number of 1s in the binary representation:\n     - 1111100101111101111101111000\n     - Count the 1s: There are 20 ones in this binary string.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 522950408 is 20.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<20>>>"
