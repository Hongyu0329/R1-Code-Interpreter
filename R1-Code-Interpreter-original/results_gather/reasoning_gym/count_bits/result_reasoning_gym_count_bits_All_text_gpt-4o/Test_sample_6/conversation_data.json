    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 1373259302, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - The first step is to convert the decimal number 1373259302 into its binary form. This involves dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder, then continuing with the quotient until the quotient is zero. The binary representation is the sequence of remainders read from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Binary Conversion Process:**\n   - Start with 1373259302 and divide by 2:\n     - 1373259302 ÷ 2 = 686629651 remainder 0\n     - 686629651 ÷ 2 = 343314825 remainder 1\n     - 343314825 ÷ 2 = 171657412 remainder 1\n     - 171657412 ÷ 2 = 85828706 remainder 0\n     - 85828706 ÷ 2 = 42914353 remainder 0\n     - 42914353 ÷ 2 = 21457176 remainder 1\n     - 21457176 ÷ 2 = 10728588 remainder 0\n     - 10728588 ÷ 2 = 5364294 remainder 0\n     - 5364294 ÷ 2 = 2682147 remainder 0\n     - 2682147 ÷ 2 = 1341073 remainder 1\n     - 1341073 ÷ 2 = 670536 remainder 1\n     - 670536 ÷ 2 = 335268 remainder 0\n     - 335268 ÷ 2 = 167634 remainder 0\n     - 167634 ÷ 2 = 83817 remainder 0\n     - 83817 ÷ 2 = 41908 remainder 1\n     - 41908 ÷ 2 = 20954 remainder 0\n     - 20954 ÷ 2 = 10477 remainder 0\n     - 10477 ÷ 2 = 5238 remainder 1\n     - 5238 ÷ 2 = 2619 remainder 0\n     - 2619 ÷ 2 = 1309 remainder 1\n     - 1309 ÷ 2 = 654 remainder 1\n     - 654 ÷ 2 = 327 remainder 0\n     - 327 ÷ 2 = 163 remainder 1\n     - 163 ÷ 2 = 81 remainder 1\n     - 81 ÷ 2 = 40 remainder 1\n     - 40 ÷ 2 = 20 remainder 0\n     - 20 ÷ 2 = 10 remainder 0\n     - 10 ÷ 2 = 5 remainder 0\n     - 5 ÷ 2 = 2 remainder 1\n     - 2 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 0\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 1373259302 is: \n     1010010001011101111011101010110\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, we need to count the number of 1s in the binary representation.\n   - The binary number 1010010001011101111011101010110 contains the following 1s:\n     - 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0\n   - Counting the 1s, we find there are 17 ones.\n\nTherefore, the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 1373259302 is 17.\n\nFinal answer: <<<17>>>"
