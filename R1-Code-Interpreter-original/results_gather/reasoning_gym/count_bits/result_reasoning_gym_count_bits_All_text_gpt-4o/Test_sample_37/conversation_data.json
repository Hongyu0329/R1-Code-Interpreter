    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 1469396266, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, we need to convert the decimal number 1469396266 into its binary form. This can be done by repeatedly dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder. The binary representation is constructed by reading the remainders from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 1469396266 and divide by 2:\n     - 1469396266 ÷ 2 = 734698133 remainder 0\n     - 734698133 ÷ 2 = 367349066 remainder 1\n     - 367349066 ÷ 2 = 183674533 remainder 0\n     - 183674533 ÷ 2 = 91837266 remainder 1\n     - 91837266 ÷ 2 = 45918633 remainder 0\n     - 45918633 ÷ 2 = 22959316 remainder 1\n     - 22959316 ÷ 2 = 11479658 remainder 0\n     - 11479658 ÷ 2 = 5739829 remainder 0\n     - 5739829 ÷ 2 = 2869914 remainder 1\n     - 2869914 ÷ 2 = 1434957 remainder 0\n     - 1434957 ÷ 2 = 717478 remainder 1\n     - 717478 ÷ 2 = 358739 remainder 0\n     - 358739 ÷ 2 = 179369 remainder 1\n     - 179369 ÷ 2 = 89684 remainder 1\n     - 89684 ÷ 2 = 44842 remainder 0\n     - 44842 ÷ 2 = 22421 remainder 0\n     - 22421 ÷ 2 = 11210 remainder 1\n     - 11210 ÷ 2 = 5605 remainder 0\n     - 5605 ÷ 2 = 2802 remainder 1\n     - 2802 ÷ 2 = 1401 remainder 0\n     - 1401 ÷ 2 = 700 remainder 1\n     - 700 ÷ 2 = 350 remainder 0\n     - 350 ÷ 2 = 175 remainder 0\n     - 175 ÷ 2 = 87 remainder 1\n     - 87 ÷ 2 = 43 remainder 1\n     - 43 ÷ 2 = 21 remainder 1\n     - 21 ÷ 2 = 10 remainder 1\n     - 10 ÷ 2 = 5 remainder 0\n     - 5 ÷ 2 = 2 remainder 1\n     - 2 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 0\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 1469396266 is: `1010111101101101011111101101010`.\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, we need to count the number of 1s in the binary representation `1010111101101101011111101101010`.\n   - By counting, we find there are 18 ones in this binary string.\n\nTherefore, the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 1469396266 is 18.\n\n<<<18>>>"
