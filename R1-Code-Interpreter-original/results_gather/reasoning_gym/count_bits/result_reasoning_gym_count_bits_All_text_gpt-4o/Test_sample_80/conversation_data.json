    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 1033469278, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, convert the decimal number 1033469278 into its binary form. This can be done by repeatedly dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder. The binary representation is constructed by reading the remainders from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Binary Conversion Process:**\n   - Divide 1033469278 by 2, the quotient is 516734639, and the remainder is 0.\n   - Divide 516734639 by 2, the quotient is 258367319, and the remainder is 1.\n   - Divide 258367319 by 2, the quotient is 129183659, and the remainder is 1.\n   - Divide 129183659 by 2, the quotient is 64591829, and the remainder is 1.\n   - Divide 64591829 by 2, the quotient is 32295914, and the remainder is 1.\n   - Divide 32295914 by 2, the quotient is 16147957, and the remainder is 0.\n   - Continue this process until the quotient is 0.\n\n3. **Construct the Binary Number:**\n   - After completing the division process, the binary representation of 1033469278 is obtained by reading the remainders from bottom to top.\n\n4. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Once the binary representation is obtained, count the number of 1s in the binary string.\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   - Double-check the binary conversion and the count of 1s to ensure accuracy.\n\nBy following these steps, we find that the binary representation of 1033469278 is `1111011011111101101011101111110`. Counting the number of 1s in this binary string gives us the final answer.\n\nThe number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 1033469278 is 21.\n\nFinal answer: <<<21>>>."
