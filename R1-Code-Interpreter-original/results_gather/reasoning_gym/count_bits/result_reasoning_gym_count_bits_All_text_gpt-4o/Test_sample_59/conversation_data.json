    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 179358953, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, convert the decimal number 179358953 to its binary form. This can be done by repeatedly dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder. The binary representation is constructed by reading the remainders from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 179358953 and divide by 2:\n     - 179358953 ÷ 2 = 89679476 remainder 1\n     - 89679476 ÷ 2 = 44839738 remainder 0\n     - 44839738 ÷ 2 = 22419869 remainder 0\n     - 22419869 ÷ 2 = 11209934 remainder 1\n     - 11209934 ÷ 2 = 5604967 remainder 0\n     - 5604967 ÷ 2 = 2802483 remainder 1\n     - 2802483 ÷ 2 = 1401241 remainder 1\n     - 1401241 ÷ 2 = 700620 remainder 1\n     - 700620 ÷ 2 = 350310 remainder 0\n     - 350310 ÷ 2 = 175155 remainder 0\n     - 175155 ÷ 2 = 87577 remainder 1\n     - 87577 ÷ 2 = 43788 remainder 1\n     - 43788 ÷ 2 = 21894 remainder 0\n     - 21894 ÷ 2 = 10947 remainder 0\n     - 10947 ÷ 2 = 5473 remainder 1\n     - 5473 ÷ 2 = 2736 remainder 1\n     - 2736 ÷ 2 = 1368 remainder 0\n     - 1368 ÷ 2 = 684 remainder 0\n     - 684 ÷ 2 = 342 remainder 0\n     - 342 ÷ 2 = 171 remainder 0\n     - 171 ÷ 2 = 85 remainder 1\n     - 85 ÷ 2 = 42 remainder 1\n     - 42 ÷ 2 = 21 remainder 0\n     - 21 ÷ 2 = 10 remainder 1\n     - 10 ÷ 2 = 5 remainder 0\n     - 5 ÷ 2 = 2 remainder 1\n     - 2 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 0\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 179358953 is: \n     1010101101101101101101101001\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, count the number of 1s in the binary representation:\n     - 1010101101101101101101101001 has 16 ones.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 179358953 is 16.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<16>>>"
