    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 853600859, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, we need to convert the decimal number 853600859 into its binary form. This involves dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder, then continuing with the quotient until the quotient is 0. The binary representation is the sequence of remainders read in reverse order.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 853600859 and divide by 2:\n     - 853600859 ÷ 2 = 426800429 remainder 1\n     - 426800429 ÷ 2 = 213400214 remainder 1\n     - 213400214 ÷ 2 = 106700107 remainder 0\n     - 106700107 ÷ 2 = 53350053 remainder 1\n     - 53350053 ÷ 2 = 26675026 remainder 1\n     - 26675026 ÷ 2 = 13337513 remainder 0\n     - 13337513 ÷ 2 = 6668756 remainder 1\n     - 6668756 ÷ 2 = 3334378 remainder 0\n     - 3334378 ÷ 2 = 1667189 remainder 0\n     - 1667189 ÷ 2 = 833594 remainder 1\n     - 833594 ÷ 2 = 416797 remainder 0\n     - 416797 ÷ 2 = 208398 remainder 1\n     - 208398 ÷ 2 = 104199 remainder 0\n     - 104199 ÷ 2 = 52099 remainder 1\n     - 52099 ÷ 2 = 26049 remainder 1\n     - 26049 ÷ 2 = 13024 remainder 1\n     - 13024 ÷ 2 = 6512 remainder 0\n     - 6512 ÷ 2 = 3256 remainder 0\n     - 3256 ÷ 2 = 1628 remainder 0\n     - 1628 ÷ 2 = 814 remainder 0\n     - 814 ÷ 2 = 407 remainder 0\n     - 407 ÷ 2 = 203 remainder 1\n     - 203 ÷ 2 = 101 remainder 1\n     - 101 ÷ 2 = 50 remainder 1\n     - 50 ÷ 2 = 25 remainder 0\n     - 25 ÷ 2 = 12 remainder 1\n     - 12 ÷ 2 = 6 remainder 0\n     - 6 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 0\n     - 3 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 1\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 853600859 is: \n     1100101111101111111011111101011\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, we count the number of 1s in the binary representation:\n     - 1100101111101111111011111101011\n     - Count the 1s: There are 23 ones in this binary number.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 853600859 is 23.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<23>>>"
