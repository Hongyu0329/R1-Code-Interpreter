    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 890655954, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, convert the decimal number 890655954 to its binary form. This can be done by repeatedly dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder. The binary representation is constructed by reading the remainders from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 890655954 and divide by 2:\n     - 890655954 ÷ 2 = 445327977 remainder 0\n     - 445327977 ÷ 2 = 222663988 remainder 1\n     - 222663988 ÷ 2 = 111331994 remainder 0\n     - 111331994 ÷ 2 = 55665997 remainder 0\n     - 55665997 ÷ 2 = 27832998 remainder 1\n     - 27832998 ÷ 2 = 13916499 remainder 0\n     - 13916499 ÷ 2 = 6958249 remainder 1\n     - 6958249 ÷ 2 = 3479124 remainder 1\n     - 3479124 ÷ 2 = 1739562 remainder 0\n     - 1739562 ÷ 2 = 869781 remainder 0\n     - 869781 ÷ 2 = 434890 remainder 1\n     - 434890 ÷ 2 = 217445 remainder 0\n     - 217445 ÷ 2 = 108722 remainder 1\n     - 108722 ÷ 2 = 54361 remainder 0\n     - 54361 ÷ 2 = 27180 remainder 1\n     - 27180 ÷ 2 = 13590 remainder 0\n     - 13590 ÷ 2 = 6795 remainder 0\n     - 6795 ÷ 2 = 3397 remainder 1\n     - 3397 ÷ 2 = 1698 remainder 1\n     - 1698 ÷ 2 = 849 remainder 0\n     - 849 ÷ 2 = 424 remainder 1\n     - 424 ÷ 2 = 212 remainder 0\n     - 212 ÷ 2 = 106 remainder 0\n     - 106 ÷ 2 = 53 remainder 0\n     - 53 ÷ 2 = 26 remainder 1\n     - 26 ÷ 2 = 13 remainder 0\n     - 13 ÷ 2 = 6 remainder 1\n     - 6 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 0\n     - 3 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 1\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 890655954 is: `110101001101111111111111110010`.\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, count the number of 1s in the binary representation `110101001101111111111111110010`.\n   - The binary string is: `110101001101111111111111110010`.\n   - Count the 1s: There are 21 ones in this binary representation.\n\nTherefore, the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 890655954 is 21.\n\n<<<21>>>"
