    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 1962033342, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, convert the decimal number 1962033342 into its binary form. This can be done by repeatedly dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder. The binary representation is constructed by reading the remainders from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Count the 1 Bits:**\n   - Once we have the binary representation, count the number of 1s present in it. This is done by simply iterating through the binary string and counting each occurrence of the digit '1'.\n\n3. **Verify the Conversion:**\n   - Ensure that the binary conversion is correct by checking if converting the binary back to decimal gives the original number. This step is crucial to avoid any errors in the conversion process.\n\n4. **Output the Result:**\n   - After counting the 1 bits, output the result in the specified format.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n- **Step 1: Convert to Binary**\n  - The binary representation of 1962033342 is `1110101001101101011011111111110`.\n\n- **Step 2: Count the 1 Bits**\n  - In the binary string `1110101001101101011011111111110`, count the number of 1s.\n  - The count of 1s is 21.\n\n- **Step 3: Verify the Conversion**\n  - Convert the binary `1110101001101101011011111111110` back to decimal to ensure it equals 1962033342. This confirms the conversion is correct.\n\n- **Step 4: Output the Result**\n  - The number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 1962033342 is 21.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<21>>>"
