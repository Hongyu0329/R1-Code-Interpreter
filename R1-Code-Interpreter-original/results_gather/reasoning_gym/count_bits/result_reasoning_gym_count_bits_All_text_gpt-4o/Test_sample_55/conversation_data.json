    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 313435549, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Decimal Number to Binary:**\n   - The first step is to convert the decimal number 313435549 into its binary form. This involves dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder, then continuing with the quotient until the quotient is 0. The binary representation is the sequence of remainders read from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 313435549 and divide by 2:\n     - 313435549 ÷ 2 = 156717774 remainder 1\n     - 156717774 ÷ 2 = 78358887 remainder 0\n     - 78358887 ÷ 2 = 39179443 remainder 1\n     - 39179443 ÷ 2 = 19589721 remainder 1\n     - 19589721 ÷ 2 = 9794860 remainder 1\n     - 9794860 ÷ 2 = 4897430 remainder 0\n     - 4897430 ÷ 2 = 2448715 remainder 0\n     - 2448715 ÷ 2 = 1224357 remainder 1\n     - 1224357 ÷ 2 = 612178 remainder 1\n     - 612178 ÷ 2 = 306089 remainder 0\n     - 306089 ÷ 2 = 153044 remainder 1\n     - 153044 ÷ 2 = 76522 remainder 0\n     - 76522 ÷ 2 = 38261 remainder 0\n     - 38261 ÷ 2 = 19130 remainder 1\n     - 19130 ÷ 2 = 9565 remainder 0\n     - 9565 ÷ 2 = 4782 remainder 1\n     - 4782 ÷ 2 = 2391 remainder 0\n     - 2391 ÷ 2 = 1195 remainder 1\n     - 1195 ÷ 2 = 597 remainder 1\n     - 597 ÷ 2 = 298 remainder 1\n     - 298 ÷ 2 = 149 remainder 0\n     - 149 ÷ 2 = 74 remainder 1\n     - 74 ÷ 2 = 37 remainder 0\n     - 37 ÷ 2 = 18 remainder 1\n     - 18 ÷ 2 = 9 remainder 0\n     - 9 ÷ 2 = 4 remainder 1\n     - 4 ÷ 2 = 2 remainder 0\n     - 2 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 0\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 313435549 is: \n     1001010110111111111011111101\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, count the number of 1s in the binary representation:\n     - 1001010110111111111011111101\n     - Count each '1': There are 20 ones in this binary number.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 313435549 is 20.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<20>>>"
