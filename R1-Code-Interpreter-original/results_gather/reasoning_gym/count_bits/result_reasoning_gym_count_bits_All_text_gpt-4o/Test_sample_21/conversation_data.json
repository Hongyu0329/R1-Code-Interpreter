    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 1325301227, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - The first step is to convert the decimal number 1325301227 into its binary form. This involves dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder, then continuing with the quotient until the quotient is 0. The binary representation is the sequence of remainders read from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 1325301227:\n     - 1325301227 ÷ 2 = 662650613 remainder 1\n     - 662650613 ÷ 2 = 331325306 remainder 1\n     - 331325306 ÷ 2 = 165662653 remainder 0\n     - 165662653 ÷ 2 = 82831326 remainder 1\n     - 82831326 ÷ 2 = 41415663 remainder 0\n     - 41415663 ÷ 2 = 20707831 remainder 1\n     - 20707831 ÷ 2 = 10353915 remainder 1\n     - 10353915 ÷ 2 = 5176957 remainder 1\n     - 5176957 ÷ 2 = 2588478 remainder 1\n     - 2588478 ÷ 2 = 1294239 remainder 0\n     - 1294239 ÷ 2 = 647119 remainder 1\n     - 647119 ÷ 2 = 323559 remainder 1\n     - 323559 ÷ 2 = 161779 remainder 1\n     - 161779 ÷ 2 = 80889 remainder 1\n     - 80889 ÷ 2 = 40444 remainder 1\n     - 40444 ÷ 2 = 20222 remainder 0\n     - 20222 ÷ 2 = 10111 remainder 0\n     - 10111 ÷ 2 = 5055 remainder 1\n     - 5055 ÷ 2 = 2527 remainder 1\n     - 2527 ÷ 2 = 1263 remainder 1\n     - 1263 ÷ 2 = 631 remainder 1\n     - 631 ÷ 2 = 315 remainder 1\n     - 315 ÷ 2 = 157 remainder 1\n     - 157 ÷ 2 = 78 remainder 1\n     - 78 ÷ 2 = 39 remainder 0\n     - 39 ÷ 2 = 19 remainder 1\n     - 19 ÷ 2 = 9 remainder 1\n     - 9 ÷ 2 = 4 remainder 1\n     - 4 ÷ 2 = 2 remainder 0\n     - 2 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 0\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 1325301227 is: \n     1001111101101101011011101101011\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1s:**\n   - Now, count the number of 1s in the binary representation:\n     - 1001111101101101011011101101011\n     - Count each '1' in the sequence.\n\n4. **Calculate the Total:**\n   - There are 21 '1' bits in the binary representation of 1325301227.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<21>>>"
