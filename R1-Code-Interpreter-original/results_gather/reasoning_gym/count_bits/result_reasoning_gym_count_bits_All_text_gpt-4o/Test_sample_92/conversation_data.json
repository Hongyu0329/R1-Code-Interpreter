    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 2063260961, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, convert the decimal number 2063260961 to its binary form. This can be done by repeatedly dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder. The binary representation is constructed by reading the remainders from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 2063260961 and divide by 2:\n     - 2063260961 ÷ 2 = 1031630480 remainder 1\n     - 1031630480 ÷ 2 = 515815240 remainder 0\n     - 515815240 ÷ 2 = 257907620 remainder 0\n     - 257907620 ÷ 2 = 128953810 remainder 0\n     - 128953810 ÷ 2 = 64476905 remainder 0\n     - 64476905 ÷ 2 = 32238452 remainder 1\n     - 32238452 ÷ 2 = 16119226 remainder 0\n     - 16119226 ÷ 2 = 8059613 remainder 0\n     - 8059613 ÷ 2 = 4029806 remainder 1\n     - 4029806 ÷ 2 = 2014903 remainder 0\n     - 2014903 ÷ 2 = 1007451 remainder 1\n     - 1007451 ÷ 2 = 503725 remainder 1\n     - 503725 ÷ 2 = 251862 remainder 1\n     - 251862 ÷ 2 = 125931 remainder 0\n     - 125931 ÷ 2 = 62965 remainder 1\n     - 62965 ÷ 2 = 31482 remainder 1\n     - 31482 ÷ 2 = 15741 remainder 0\n     - 15741 ÷ 2 = 7870 remainder 1\n     - 7870 ÷ 2 = 3935 remainder 0\n     - 3935 ÷ 2 = 1967 remainder 1\n     - 1967 ÷ 2 = 983 remainder 1\n     - 983 ÷ 2 = 491 remainder 1\n     - 491 ÷ 2 = 245 remainder 1\n     - 245 ÷ 2 = 122 remainder 1\n     - 122 ÷ 2 = 61 remainder 0\n     - 61 ÷ 2 = 30 remainder 1\n     - 30 ÷ 2 = 15 remainder 0\n     - 15 ÷ 2 = 7 remainder 1\n     - 7 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 1\n     - 3 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 1\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 2063260961 is: `1111010111011101101011101000001`.\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, count the number of 1s in the binary representation `1111010111011101101011101000001`.\n\n4. **Perform the Count:**\n   - The binary string `1111010111011101101011101000001` contains 19 ones.\n\nTherefore, the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 2063260961 is 19.\n\nFinal answer: <<<19>>>."
