    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 1086498758, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, convert the decimal number 1086498758 into its binary form. This can be done using the division-by-2 method or by using a calculator or programming tool that provides binary conversion.\n\n2. **Understand Binary Representation:**\n   - Binary numbers are composed of 0s and 1s. Each digit represents a power of 2, starting from 2^0 on the right.\n\n3. **Count the 1 Bits:**\n   - Once the number is converted to binary, count the number of 1s present in the binary string. This is often referred to as the \"Hamming weight\" or \"population count\" of the binary number.\n\n4. **Verify the Conversion:**\n   - Double-check the binary conversion to ensure accuracy. This can be done by converting the binary number back to decimal and verifying it matches the original number.\n\n5. **Final Count:**\n   - After verifying the binary conversion, the count of 1s in the binary representation is the answer.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n- **Step 1:** Convert 1086498758 to binary.\n  - The binary representation of 1086498758 is `1000000101101110001111111010110`.\n\n- **Step 2:** Count the 1 bits.\n  - In the binary string `1000000101101110001111111010110`, count the number of 1s.\n\n- **Step 3:** Verify the count.\n  - The binary string has 17 ones.\n\nTherefore, the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 1086498758 is 17.\n\nFinal answer: <<<17>>>."
