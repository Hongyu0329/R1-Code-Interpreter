    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 705879002, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, we need to convert the decimal number 705879002 into its binary form. This involves dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder, then continuing with the quotient until the quotient is 0. The binary representation is the sequence of remainders read in reverse order.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 705879002 and divide by 2:\n     - 705879002 ÷ 2 = 352939501 remainder 0\n     - 352939501 ÷ 2 = 176469750 remainder 1\n     - 176469750 ÷ 2 = 88234875 remainder 0\n     - 88234875 ÷ 2 = 44117437 remainder 1\n     - 44117437 ÷ 2 = 22058718 remainder 1\n     - 22058718 ÷ 2 = 11029359 remainder 0\n     - 11029359 ÷ 2 = 5514679 remainder 1\n     - 5514679 ÷ 2 = 2757339 remainder 1\n     - 2757339 ÷ 2 = 1378669 remainder 1\n     - 1378669 ÷ 2 = 689334 remainder 1\n     - 689334 ÷ 2 = 344667 remainder 0\n     - 344667 ÷ 2 = 172333 remainder 1\n     - 172333 ÷ 2 = 86166 remainder 1\n     - 86166 ÷ 2 = 43083 remainder 0\n     - 43083 ÷ 2 = 21541 remainder 1\n     - 21541 ÷ 2 = 10770 remainder 1\n     - 10770 ÷ 2 = 5385 remainder 0\n     - 5385 ÷ 2 = 2692 remainder 1\n     - 2692 ÷ 2 = 1346 remainder 0\n     - 1346 ÷ 2 = 673 remainder 0\n     - 673 ÷ 2 = 336 remainder 1\n     - 336 ÷ 2 = 168 remainder 0\n     - 168 ÷ 2 = 84 remainder 0\n     - 84 ÷ 2 = 42 remainder 0\n     - 42 ÷ 2 = 21 remainder 0\n     - 21 ÷ 2 = 10 remainder 1\n     - 10 ÷ 2 = 5 remainder 0\n     - 5 ÷ 2 = 2 remainder 1\n     - 2 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 0\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 705879002 is: \n     10101000000000000000000010101010\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, we need to count the number of 1s in the binary representation.\n   - The binary number 10101000000000000000000010101010 has the following 1s:\n     - 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0\n   - Counting the 1s, we find there are 8 ones.\n\nTherefore, the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 705879002 is 8.\n\nFinal answer: <<<8>>>"
