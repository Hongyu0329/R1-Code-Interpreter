    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 1061903684, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, convert the decimal number 1061903684 into its binary form. This can be done by repeatedly dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder. The binary representation is constructed by reading the remainders from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Binary Conversion Process:**\n   - Divide 1061903684 by 2, the quotient is 530951842, and the remainder is 0.\n   - Divide 530951842 by 2, the quotient is 265475921, and the remainder is 0.\n   - Divide 265475921 by 2, the quotient is 132737960, and the remainder is 1.\n   - Continue this process until the quotient becomes 0.\n\n3. **Construct the Binary Representation:**\n   - By following the division and remainder process, the binary representation of 1061903684 is obtained. For this specific number, the binary representation is `111111001111111111111111110100`.\n\n4. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Once the binary representation is obtained, count the number of 1s in the binary string. This involves simply iterating over the binary digits and counting each occurrence of the digit '1'.\n\n5. **Final Count:**\n   - In the binary representation `111111001111111111111111110100`, count the number of 1s. There are 24 occurrences of the digit '1'.\n\nTherefore, the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 1061903684 is 24.\n\n<<<24>>>"
