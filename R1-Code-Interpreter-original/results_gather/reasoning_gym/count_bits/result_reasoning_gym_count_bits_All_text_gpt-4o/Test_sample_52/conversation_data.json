    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 1570951152, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, we need to convert the decimal number 1570951152 into its binary form. This can be done using the division-by-2 method or using a calculator or programming tool that provides binary conversion.\n\n2. **Binary Conversion:**\n   - When we convert 1570951152 to binary, we get: `1011101100001010101010100000000`.\n\n3. **Count the 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, we need to count the number of 1s in the binary representation.\n   - The binary string `1011101100001010101010100000000` contains the following 1s:\n     - 1st position: 1\n     - 3rd position: 1\n     - 4th position: 1\n     - 7th position: 1\n     - 9th position: 1\n     - 12th position: 1\n     - 14th position: 1\n     - 16th position: 1\n     - 18th position: 1\n     - 20th position: 1\n   - Counting these, we find there are 10 ones in total.\n\n4. **Verify the Count:**\n   - Double-check the binary string to ensure no 1s are missed or miscounted. The binary string should be carefully reviewed to confirm the count of 1s.\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   - After verifying, we conclude that the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 1570951152 is 10.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<10>>>"
