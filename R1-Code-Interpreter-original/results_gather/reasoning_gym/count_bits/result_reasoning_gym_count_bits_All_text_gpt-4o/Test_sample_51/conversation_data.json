    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 1065487253, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, convert the decimal number 1065487253 into its binary form. This can be done by repeatedly dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder. The binary representation is constructed by reading the remainders from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 1065487253 and divide by 2:\n     - 1065487253 ÷ 2 = 532743626 with a remainder of 1\n     - 532743626 ÷ 2 = 266371813 with a remainder of 0\n     - 266371813 ÷ 2 = 133185906 with a remainder of 1\n     - 133185906 ÷ 2 = 66592953 with a remainder of 0\n     - 66592953 ÷ 2 = 33296476 with a remainder of 1\n     - 33296476 ÷ 2 = 16648238 with a remainder of 0\n     - 16648238 ÷ 2 = 8324119 with a remainder of 0\n     - 8324119 ÷ 2 = 4162059 with a remainder of 1\n     - 4162059 ÷ 2 = 2081029 with a remainder of 1\n     - 2081029 ÷ 2 = 1040514 with a remainder of 1\n     - 1040514 ÷ 2 = 520257 with a remainder of 0\n     - 520257 ÷ 2 = 260128 with a remainder of 1\n     - 260128 ÷ 2 = 130064 with a remainder of 0\n     - 130064 ÷ 2 = 65032 with a remainder of 0\n     - 65032 ÷ 2 = 32516 with a remainder of 0\n     - 32516 ÷ 2 = 16258 with a remainder of 0\n     - 16258 ÷ 2 = 8129 with a remainder of 0\n     - 8129 ÷ 2 = 4064 with a remainder of 1\n     - 4064 ÷ 2 = 2032 with a remainder of 0\n     - 2032 ÷ 2 = 1016 with a remainder of 0\n     - 1016 ÷ 2 = 508 with a remainder of 0\n     - 508 ÷ 2 = 254 with a remainder of 0\n     - 254 ÷ 2 = 127 with a remainder of 0\n     - 127 ÷ 2 = 63 with a remainder of 1\n     - 63 ÷ 2 = 31 with a remainder of 1\n     - 31 ÷ 2 = 15 with a remainder of 1\n     - 15 ÷ 2 = 7 with a remainder of 1\n     - 7 ÷ 2 = 3 with a remainder of 1\n     - 3 ÷ 2 = 1 with a remainder of 1\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 with a remainder of 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 1065487253 is: `111111110000000111111111110101`\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, count the number of 1s in the binary representation `111111110000000111111111110101`.\n   - The binary string has 20 ones.\n\nTherefore, the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 1065487253 is 20.\n\nFinal answer: <<<20>>>"
