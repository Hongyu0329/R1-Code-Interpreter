    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 1247166526, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Decimal Number to Binary:**\n   - The first step is to convert the decimal number 1247166526 into its binary form. This involves dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder, then continuing with the quotient until the quotient is 0. The binary representation is the sequence of remainders read from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Binary Conversion Process:**\n   - Start with 1247166526 and divide by 2:\n     - 1247166526 ÷ 2 = 623583263 remainder 0\n     - 623583263 ÷ 2 = 311791631 remainder 1\n     - 311791631 ÷ 2 = 155895815 remainder 1\n     - 155895815 ÷ 2 = 77947907 remainder 1\n     - 77947907 ÷ 2 = 38973953 remainder 1\n     - 38973953 ÷ 2 = 19486976 remainder 1\n     - 19486976 ÷ 2 = 9743488 remainder 0\n     - 9743488 ÷ 2 = 4871744 remainder 0\n     - 4871744 ÷ 2 = 2435872 remainder 0\n     - 2435872 ÷ 2 = 1217936 remainder 0\n     - 1217936 ÷ 2 = 608968 remainder 0\n     - 608968 ÷ 2 = 304484 remainder 0\n     - 304484 ÷ 2 = 152242 remainder 0\n     - 152242 ÷ 2 = 76121 remainder 0\n     - 76121 ÷ 2 = 38060 remainder 1\n     - 38060 ÷ 2 = 19030 remainder 0\n     - 19030 ÷ 2 = 9515 remainder 0\n     - 9515 ÷ 2 = 4757 remainder 1\n     - 4757 ÷ 2 = 2378 remainder 1\n     - 2378 ÷ 2 = 1189 remainder 0\n     - 1189 ÷ 2 = 594 remainder 1\n     - 594 ÷ 2 = 297 remainder 0\n     - 297 ÷ 2 = 148 remainder 1\n     - 148 ÷ 2 = 74 remainder 0\n     - 74 ÷ 2 = 37 remainder 0\n     - 37 ÷ 2 = 18 remainder 1\n     - 18 ÷ 2 = 9 remainder 0\n     - 9 ÷ 2 = 4 remainder 1\n     - 4 ÷ 2 = 2 remainder 0\n     - 2 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 0\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 1247166526 is: \n     1001010011111111111111111111110\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, count the number of 1s in the binary representation:\n     - The binary number 1001010011111111111111111111110 contains 22 ones.\n\n4. **Final Answer:**\n   - The number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 1247166526 is 22.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<22>>>"
