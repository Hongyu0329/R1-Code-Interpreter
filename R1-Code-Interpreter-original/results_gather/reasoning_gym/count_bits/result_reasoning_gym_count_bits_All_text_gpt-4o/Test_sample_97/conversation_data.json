    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 1258635374, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Decimal Number to Binary:**\n   - The first step is to convert the decimal number 1258635374 into its binary form. This involves dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder, then continuing with the quotient until the quotient is 0. The binary representation is the sequence of remainders read from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 1258635374 and divide by 2:\n     - 1258635374 ÷ 2 = 629317687 remainder 0\n     - 629317687 ÷ 2 = 314658843 remainder 1\n     - 314658843 ÷ 2 = 157329421 remainder 1\n     - 157329421 ÷ 2 = 78664710 remainder 1\n     - 78664710 ÷ 2 = 39332355 remainder 0\n     - 39332355 ÷ 2 = 19666177 remainder 1\n     - 19666177 ÷ 2 = 9833088 remainder 1\n     - 9833088 ÷ 2 = 4916544 remainder 0\n     - 4916544 ÷ 2 = 2458272 remainder 0\n     - 2458272 ÷ 2 = 1229136 remainder 0\n     - 1229136 ÷ 2 = 614568 remainder 0\n     - 614568 ÷ 2 = 307284 remainder 0\n     - 307284 ÷ 2 = 153642 remainder 0\n     - 153642 ÷ 2 = 76821 remainder 0\n     - 76821 ÷ 2 = 38410 remainder 1\n     - 38410 ÷ 2 = 19205 remainder 0\n     - 19205 ÷ 2 = 9602 remainder 1\n     - 9602 ÷ 2 = 4801 remainder 0\n     - 4801 ÷ 2 = 2400 remainder 1\n     - 2400 ÷ 2 = 1200 remainder 0\n     - 1200 ÷ 2 = 600 remainder 0\n     - 600 ÷ 2 = 300 remainder 0\n     - 300 ÷ 2 = 150 remainder 0\n     - 150 ÷ 2 = 75 remainder 0\n     - 75 ÷ 2 = 37 remainder 1\n     - 37 ÷ 2 = 18 remainder 1\n     - 18 ÷ 2 = 9 remainder 0\n     - 9 ÷ 2 = 4 remainder 1\n     - 4 ÷ 2 = 2 remainder 0\n     - 2 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 0\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 1258635374 is: \n     1001011001111111111011111111110\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, count the number of 1s in the binary representation:\n     - 1001011001111111111011111111110\n     - There are 21 ones in this binary string.\n\nTherefore, the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 1258635374 is 21.\n\nFinal answer: <<<21>>>"
