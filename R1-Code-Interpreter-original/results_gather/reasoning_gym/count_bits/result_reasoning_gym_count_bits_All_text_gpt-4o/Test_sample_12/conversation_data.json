    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 877324117, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - The first step is to convert the decimal number 877324117 into its binary form. This involves dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder, then continuing with the quotient until the quotient is 0. The binary representation is the sequence of remainders read from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 877324117:\n     - 877324117 ÷ 2 = 438662058 remainder 1\n     - 438662058 ÷ 2 = 219331029 remainder 0\n     - 219331029 ÷ 2 = 109665514 remainder 1\n     - 109665514 ÷ 2 = 54832757 remainder 0\n     - 54832757 ÷ 2 = 27416378 remainder 1\n     - 27416378 ÷ 2 = 13708189 remainder 0\n     - 13708189 ÷ 2 = 6854094 remainder 1\n     - 6854094 ÷ 2 = 3427047 remainder 0\n     - 3427047 ÷ 2 = 1713523 remainder 1\n     - 1713523 ÷ 2 = 856761 remainder 1\n     - 856761 ÷ 2 = 428380 remainder 1\n     - 428380 ÷ 2 = 214190 remainder 0\n     - 214190 ÷ 2 = 107095 remainder 0\n     - 107095 ÷ 2 = 53547 remainder 1\n     - 53547 ÷ 2 = 26773 remainder 1\n     - 26773 ÷ 2 = 13386 remainder 1\n     - 13386 ÷ 2 = 6693 remainder 0\n     - 6693 ÷ 2 = 3346 remainder 1\n     - 3346 ÷ 2 = 1673 remainder 0\n     - 1673 ÷ 2 = 836 remainder 1\n     - 836 ÷ 2 = 418 remainder 0\n     - 418 ÷ 2 = 209 remainder 0\n     - 209 ÷ 2 = 104 remainder 1\n     - 104 ÷ 2 = 52 remainder 0\n     - 52 ÷ 2 = 26 remainder 0\n     - 26 ÷ 2 = 13 remainder 0\n     - 13 ÷ 2 = 6 remainder 1\n     - 6 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 0\n     - 3 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 1\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 877324117 is: \n     110100010010110101101101111101\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, count the number of 1s in the binary representation:\n     - 110100010010110101101101111101\n     - Count each '1': There are 19 ones in this binary string.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 877324117 is 19.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<19>>>"
