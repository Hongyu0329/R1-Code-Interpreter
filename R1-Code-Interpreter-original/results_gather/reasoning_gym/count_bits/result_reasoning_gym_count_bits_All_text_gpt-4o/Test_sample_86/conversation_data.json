    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 1526822798, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, convert the decimal number 1526822798 into its binary form. This can be done by repeatedly dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder. The binary representation is constructed by reading the remainders from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Binary Conversion Process:**\n   - Divide 1526822798 by 2, the quotient is 763411399 and the remainder is 0.\n   - Divide 763411399 by 2, the quotient is 381705699 and the remainder is 1.\n   - Divide 381705699 by 2, the quotient is 190852849 and the remainder is 1.\n   - Divide 190852849 by 2, the quotient is 95426424 and the remainder is 1.\n   - Continue this process until the quotient is 0.\n\n3. **Construct the Binary Number:**\n   - After completing the division process, the binary representation of 1526822798 is obtained by reading the remainders from bottom to top.\n\n4. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Once the binary representation is obtained, count the number of 1s in the binary string.\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   - Double-check the binary conversion and the count of 1s to ensure accuracy.\n\nBy following these steps, we find that the binary representation of 1526822798 contains 16 bits that are 1.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<16>>>"
