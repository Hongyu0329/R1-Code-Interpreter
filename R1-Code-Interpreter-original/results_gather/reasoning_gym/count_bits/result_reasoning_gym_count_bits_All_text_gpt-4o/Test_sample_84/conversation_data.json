    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 1763851869, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, convert the decimal number 1763851869 to its binary form. This can be done using the division-by-2 method, where you repeatedly divide the number by 2 and record the remainder. The binary representation is formed by the remainders read in reverse order.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 1763851869 and divide by 2:\n     - 1763851869 ÷ 2 = 881925934 remainder 1\n     - 881925934 ÷ 2 = 440962967 remainder 0\n     - 440962967 ÷ 2 = 220481483 remainder 1\n     - 220481483 ÷ 2 = 110240741 remainder 1\n     - 110240741 ÷ 2 = 55120370 remainder 1\n     - 55120370 ÷ 2 = 27560185 remainder 0\n     - 27560185 ÷ 2 = 13780092 remainder 1\n     - 13780092 ÷ 2 = 6890046 remainder 0\n     - 6890046 ÷ 2 = 3445023 remainder 0\n     - 3445023 ÷ 2 = 1722511 remainder 1\n     - 1722511 ÷ 2 = 861255 remainder 1\n     - 861255 ÷ 2 = 430627 remainder 1\n     - 430627 ÷ 2 = 215313 remainder 1\n     - 215313 ÷ 2 = 107656 remainder 1\n     - 107656 ÷ 2 = 53828 remainder 0\n     - 53828 ÷ 2 = 26914 remainder 0\n     - 26914 ÷ 2 = 13457 remainder 0\n     - 13457 ÷ 2 = 6728 remainder 1\n     - 6728 ÷ 2 = 3364 remainder 0\n     - 3364 ÷ 2 = 1682 remainder 0\n     - 1682 ÷ 2 = 841 remainder 0\n     - 841 ÷ 2 = 420 remainder 1\n     - 420 ÷ 2 = 210 remainder 0\n     - 210 ÷ 2 = 105 remainder 0\n     - 105 ÷ 2 = 52 remainder 1\n     - 52 ÷ 2 = 26 remainder 0\n     - 26 ÷ 2 = 13 remainder 0\n     - 13 ÷ 2 = 6 remainder 1\n     - 6 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 0\n     - 3 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 1\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 1763851869 is: \n     1101001001101101101011111101101\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, count the number of 1s in the binary representation:\n     - 1101001001101101101011111101101\n     - Count each 1: There are 18 ones in this binary number.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 1763851869 is 18.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<18>>>"
