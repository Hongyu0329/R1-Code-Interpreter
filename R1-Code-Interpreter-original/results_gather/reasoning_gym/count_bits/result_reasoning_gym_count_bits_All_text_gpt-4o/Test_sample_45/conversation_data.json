    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 1716087199, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, we need to convert the decimal number 1716087199 into its binary form. This can be done by repeatedly dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder. The binary representation is constructed by reading the remainders from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 1716087199 and divide by 2:\n     - 1716087199 ÷ 2 = 858043599 remainder 1\n     - 858043599 ÷ 2 = 429021799 remainder 1\n     - 429021799 ÷ 2 = 214510899 remainder 1\n     - 214510899 ÷ 2 = 107255449 remainder 1\n     - 107255449 ÷ 2 = 53627724 remainder 1\n     - 53627724 ÷ 2 = 26813862 remainder 0\n     - 26813862 ÷ 2 = 13406931 remainder 0\n     - 13406931 ÷ 2 = 6703465 remainder 1\n     - 6703465 ÷ 2 = 3351732 remainder 1\n     - 3351732 ÷ 2 = 1675866 remainder 0\n     - 1675866 ÷ 2 = 837933 remainder 0\n     - 837933 ÷ 2 = 418966 remainder 1\n     - 418966 ÷ 2 = 209483 remainder 0\n     - 209483 ÷ 2 = 104741 remainder 1\n     - 104741 ÷ 2 = 52370 remainder 1\n     - 52370 ÷ 2 = 26185 remainder 0\n     - 26185 ÷ 2 = 13092 remainder 1\n     - 13092 ÷ 2 = 6546 remainder 0\n     - 6546 ÷ 2 = 3273 remainder 0\n     - 3273 ÷ 2 = 1636 remainder 1\n     - 1636 ÷ 2 = 818 remainder 0\n     - 818 ÷ 2 = 409 remainder 0\n     - 409 ÷ 2 = 204 remainder 1\n     - 204 ÷ 2 = 102 remainder 0\n     - 102 ÷ 2 = 51 remainder 0\n     - 51 ÷ 2 = 25 remainder 1\n     - 25 ÷ 2 = 12 remainder 1\n     - 12 ÷ 2 = 6 remainder 0\n     - 6 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 0\n     - 3 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 1\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 1716087199 is: \n     1100110011111111111111111111111\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, we need to count the number of 1s in the binary representation.\n   - The binary string is: 1100110011111111111111111111111\n   - Count the 1s: There are 26 ones in this binary representation.\n\nTherefore, the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 1716087199 is 26.\n\nFinal answer: <<<26>>>"
