    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 1592721913, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, convert the decimal number 1592721913 into its binary form. This can be done using the division-by-2 method, where you repeatedly divide the number by 2 and record the remainder. The binary representation is formed by the remainders read in reverse order.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 1592721913 and divide by 2:\n     - 1592721913 ÷ 2 = 796360956 remainder 1\n     - 796360956 ÷ 2 = 398180478 remainder 0\n     - 398180478 ÷ 2 = 199090239 remainder 0\n     - 199090239 ÷ 2 = 99545119 remainder 1\n     - 99545119 ÷ 2 = 49772559 remainder 1\n     - 49772559 ÷ 2 = 24886279 remainder 1\n     - 24886279 ÷ 2 = 12443139 remainder 1\n     - 12443139 ÷ 2 = 6221569 remainder 1\n     - 6221569 ÷ 2 = 3110784 remainder 1\n     - 3110784 ÷ 2 = 1555392 remainder 0\n     - 1555392 ÷ 2 = 777696 remainder 0\n     - 777696 ÷ 2 = 388848 remainder 0\n     - 388848 ÷ 2 = 194424 remainder 0\n     - 194424 ÷ 2 = 97212 remainder 0\n     - 97212 ÷ 2 = 48606 remainder 0\n     - 48606 ÷ 2 = 24303 remainder 0\n     - 24303 ÷ 2 = 12151 remainder 1\n     - 12151 ÷ 2 = 6075 remainder 1\n     - 6075 ÷ 2 = 3037 remainder 1\n     - 3037 ÷ 2 = 1518 remainder 1\n     - 1518 ÷ 2 = 759 remainder 0\n     - 759 ÷ 2 = 379 remainder 1\n     - 379 ÷ 2 = 189 remainder 1\n     - 189 ÷ 2 = 94 remainder 1\n     - 94 ÷ 2 = 47 remainder 0\n     - 47 ÷ 2 = 23 remainder 1\n     - 23 ÷ 2 = 11 remainder 1\n     - 11 ÷ 2 = 5 remainder 1\n     - 5 ÷ 2 = 2 remainder 1\n     - 2 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 0\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 1592721913 is: `1011110111011111111011111101001`.\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, count the number of 1s in the binary representation `1011110111011111111011111101001`.\n   - The binary string contains 22 ones.\n\nTherefore, the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 1592721913 is 22.\n\nFinal answer: <<<22>>>."
