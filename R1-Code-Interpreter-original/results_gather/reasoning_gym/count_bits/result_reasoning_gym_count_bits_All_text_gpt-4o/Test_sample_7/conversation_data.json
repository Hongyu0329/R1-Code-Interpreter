    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 450652120, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, convert the decimal number 450652120 into its binary form. This can be done using the division-by-2 method, where you repeatedly divide the number by 2 and record the remainder. The binary representation is formed by the remainders read in reverse order.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 450652120 and divide by 2:\n     - 450652120 ÷ 2 = 225326060, remainder = 0\n     - 225326060 ÷ 2 = 112663030, remainder = 0\n     - 112663030 ÷ 2 = 56331515, remainder = 0\n     - 56331515 ÷ 2 = 28165757, remainder = 1\n     - 28165757 ÷ 2 = 14082878, remainder = 1\n     - 14082878 ÷ 2 = 7041439, remainder = 0\n     - 7041439 ÷ 2 = 3520719, remainder = 1\n     - 3520719 ÷ 2 = 1760359, remainder = 1\n     - 1760359 ÷ 2 = 880179, remainder = 1\n     - 880179 ÷ 2 = 440089, remainder = 1\n     - 440089 ÷ 2 = 220044, remainder = 1\n     - 220044 ÷ 2 = 110022, remainder = 0\n     - 110022 ÷ 2 = 55011, remainder = 0\n     - 55011 ÷ 2 = 27505, remainder = 1\n     - 27505 ÷ 2 = 13752, remainder = 1\n     - 13752 ÷ 2 = 6876, remainder = 0\n     - 6876 ÷ 2 = 3438, remainder = 0\n     - 3438 ÷ 2 = 1719, remainder = 0\n     - 1719 ÷ 2 = 859, remainder = 1\n     - 859 ÷ 2 = 429, remainder = 1\n     - 429 ÷ 2 = 214, remainder = 1\n     - 214 ÷ 2 = 107, remainder = 0\n     - 107 ÷ 2 = 53, remainder = 1\n     - 53 ÷ 2 = 26, remainder = 1\n     - 26 ÷ 2 = 13, remainder = 0\n     - 13 ÷ 2 = 6, remainder = 1\n     - 6 ÷ 2 = 3, remainder = 0\n     - 3 ÷ 2 = 1, remainder = 1\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0, remainder = 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 450652120 is: `1101011101111111111111111000`.\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, count the number of 1s in the binary representation `1101011101111111111111111000`.\n   - The binary string has 22 ones.\n\nTherefore, the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 450652120 is 22.\n\nFinal answer: <<<22>>>."
