    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 95725786, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Decimal Number to Binary:**\n   - The first step is to convert the decimal number 95725786 into its binary form. This involves dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder, then continuing with the quotient until the quotient is 0. The binary representation is the sequence of remainders read from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 95725786 and divide by 2:\n     - 95725786 ÷ 2 = 47862893 remainder 0\n     - 47862893 ÷ 2 = 23931446 remainder 1\n     - 23931446 ÷ 2 = 11965723 remainder 0\n     - 11965723 ÷ 2 = 5982861 remainder 1\n     - 5982861 ÷ 2 = 2991430 remainder 1\n     - 2991430 ÷ 2 = 1495715 remainder 0\n     - 1495715 ÷ 2 = 747857 remainder 1\n     - 747857 ÷ 2 = 373928 remainder 1\n     - 373928 ÷ 2 = 186964 remainder 0\n     - 186964 ÷ 2 = 93482 remainder 0\n     - 93482 ÷ 2 = 46741 remainder 0\n     - 46741 ÷ 2 = 23370 remainder 1\n     - 23370 ÷ 2 = 11685 remainder 0\n     - 11685 ÷ 2 = 5842 remainder 1\n     - 5842 ÷ 2 = 2921 remainder 0\n     - 2921 ÷ 2 = 1460 remainder 1\n     - 1460 ÷ 2 = 730 remainder 0\n     - 730 ÷ 2 = 365 remainder 0\n     - 365 ÷ 2 = 182 remainder 1\n     - 182 ÷ 2 = 91 remainder 0\n     - 91 ÷ 2 = 45 remainder 1\n     - 45 ÷ 2 = 22 remainder 1\n     - 22 ÷ 2 = 11 remainder 0\n     - 11 ÷ 2 = 5 remainder 1\n     - 5 ÷ 2 = 2 remainder 1\n     - 2 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 0\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 95725786 is: 10110110011111111111111010.\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, count the number of 1s in the binary representation:\n     - 10110110011111111111111010 has 19 ones.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 95725786 is 19.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<19>>>"
