    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 1885703990, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, convert the decimal number 1885703990 to its binary form. This can be done using the division-by-2 method, where you repeatedly divide the number by 2 and record the remainder. The binary representation is formed by the remainders read in reverse order.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 1885703990 and divide by 2:\n     - 1885703990 ÷ 2 = 942851995 remainder 0\n     - 942851995 ÷ 2 = 471425997 remainder 1\n     - 471425997 ÷ 2 = 235712998 remainder 1\n     - 235712998 ÷ 2 = 117856499 remainder 0\n     - 117856499 ÷ 2 = 58928249 remainder 1\n     - 58928249 ÷ 2 = 29464124 remainder 1\n     - 29464124 ÷ 2 = 14732062 remainder 0\n     - 14732062 ÷ 2 = 7366031 remainder 0\n     - 7366031 ÷ 2 = 3683015 remainder 1\n     - 3683015 ÷ 2 = 1841507 remainder 1\n     - 1841507 ÷ 2 = 920753 remainder 1\n     - 920753 ÷ 2 = 460376 remainder 1\n     - 460376 ÷ 2 = 230188 remainder 0\n     - 230188 ÷ 2 = 115094 remainder 0\n     - 115094 ÷ 2 = 57547 remainder 0\n     - 57547 ÷ 2 = 28773 remainder 1\n     - 28773 ÷ 2 = 14386 remainder 1\n     - 14386 ÷ 2 = 7193 remainder 0\n     - 7193 ÷ 2 = 3596 remainder 1\n     - 3596 ÷ 2 = 1798 remainder 0\n     - 1798 ÷ 2 = 899 remainder 0\n     - 899 ÷ 2 = 449 remainder 1\n     - 449 ÷ 2 = 224 remainder 1\n     - 224 ÷ 2 = 112 remainder 0\n     - 112 ÷ 2 = 56 remainder 0\n     - 56 ÷ 2 = 28 remainder 0\n     - 28 ÷ 2 = 14 remainder 0\n     - 14 ÷ 2 = 7 remainder 0\n     - 7 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 1\n     - 3 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 1\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 1885703990 is: \n     1110000011101111111111111100110\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, count the number of 1s in the binary representation:\n     - 1110000011101111111111111100110 has 21 ones.\n\nTherefore, the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 1885703990 is 21.\n\nFinal answer: <<<21>>>"
