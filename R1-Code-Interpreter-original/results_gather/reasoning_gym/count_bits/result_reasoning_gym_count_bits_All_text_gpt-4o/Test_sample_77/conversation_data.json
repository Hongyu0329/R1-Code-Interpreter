    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 600,400,002, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Decimal Number to Binary:**\n   - The first step is to convert the decimal number 600,400,002 into its binary form. This involves dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder, then continuing with the quotient until the quotient is zero. The binary representation is the sequence of remainders read from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 600,400,002 and divide by 2:\n     - 600,400,002 ÷ 2 = 300,200,001 remainder 0\n     - 300,200,001 ÷ 2 = 150,100,000 remainder 1\n     - 150,100,000 ÷ 2 = 75,050,000 remainder 0\n     - 75,050,000 ÷ 2 = 37,525,000 remainder 0\n     - 37,525,000 ÷ 2 = 18,762,500 remainder 0\n     - 18,762,500 ÷ 2 = 9,381,250 remainder 0\n     - 9,381,250 ÷ 2 = 4,690,625 remainder 0\n     - 4,690,625 ÷ 2 = 2,345,312 remainder 1\n     - 2,345,312 ÷ 2 = 1,172,656 remainder 0\n     - 1,172,656 ÷ 2 = 586,328 remainder 0\n     - 586,328 ÷ 2 = 293,164 remainder 0\n     - 293,164 ÷ 2 = 146,582 remainder 0\n     - 146,582 ÷ 2 = 73,291 remainder 0\n     - 73,291 ÷ 2 = 36,645 remainder 1\n     - 36,645 ÷ 2 = 18,322 remainder 1\n     - 18,322 ÷ 2 = 9,161 remainder 0\n     - 9,161 ÷ 2 = 4,580 remainder 1\n     - 4,580 ÷ 2 = 2,290 remainder 0\n     - 2,290 ÷ 2 = 1,145 remainder 0\n     - 1,145 ÷ 2 = 572 remainder 1\n     - 572 ÷ 2 = 286 remainder 0\n     - 286 ÷ 2 = 143 remainder 0\n     - 143 ÷ 2 = 71 remainder 1\n     - 71 ÷ 2 = 35 remainder 1\n     - 35 ÷ 2 = 17 remainder 1\n     - 17 ÷ 2 = 8 remainder 1\n     - 8 ÷ 2 = 4 remainder 0\n     - 4 ÷ 2 = 2 remainder 0\n     - 2 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 0\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 600,400,002 is:\n     - 100011110111101111101000000010\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, count the number of 1s in the binary representation:\n     - 100011110111101111101000000010\n     - There are 16 ones in this binary number.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 600,400,002 is 16.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<16>>>"
