    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 1464593646, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, we need to convert the decimal number 1464593646 into its binary form. This involves dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder, then continuing with the quotient until the quotient is 0. The binary representation is the sequence of remainders read in reverse order.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 1464593646 and divide by 2:\n     - 1464593646 ÷ 2 = 732296823 remainder 0\n     - 732296823 ÷ 2 = 366148411 remainder 1\n     - 366148411 ÷ 2 = 183074205 remainder 1\n     - 183074205 ÷ 2 = 91537102 remainder 1\n     - 91537102 ÷ 2 = 45768551 remainder 0\n     - 45768551 ÷ 2 = 22884275 remainder 1\n     - 22884275 ÷ 2 = 11442137 remainder 1\n     - 11442137 ÷ 2 = 5721068 remainder 1\n     - 5721068 ÷ 2 = 2860534 remainder 0\n     - 2860534 ÷ 2 = 1430267 remainder 0\n     - 1430267 ÷ 2 = 715133 remainder 1\n     - 715133 ÷ 2 = 357566 remainder 1\n     - 357566 ÷ 2 = 178783 remainder 0\n     - 178783 ÷ 2 = 89391 remainder 1\n     - 89391 ÷ 2 = 44695 remainder 1\n     - 44695 ÷ 2 = 22347 remainder 1\n     - 22347 ÷ 2 = 11173 remainder 1\n     - 11173 ÷ 2 = 5586 remainder 1\n     - 5586 ÷ 2 = 2793 remainder 0\n     - 2793 ÷ 2 = 1396 remainder 1\n     - 1396 ÷ 2 = 698 remainder 0\n     - 698 ÷ 2 = 349 remainder 0\n     - 349 ÷ 2 = 174 remainder 1\n     - 174 ÷ 2 = 87 remainder 0\n     - 87 ÷ 2 = 43 remainder 1\n     - 43 ÷ 2 = 21 remainder 1\n     - 21 ÷ 2 = 10 remainder 1\n     - 10 ÷ 2 = 5 remainder 0\n     - 5 ÷ 2 = 2 remainder 1\n     - 2 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 0\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 1464593646 is: \n     1010111010101010101010101011110\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1s:**\n   - Now, we need to count the number of 1s in the binary representation.\n   - The binary number 1010111010101010101010101011110 contains 17 ones.\n\nTherefore, the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 1464593646 is 17.\n\n<<<17>>>"
