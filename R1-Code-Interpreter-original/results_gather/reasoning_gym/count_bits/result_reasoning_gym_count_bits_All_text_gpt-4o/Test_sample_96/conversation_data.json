    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 2018707825, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, convert the decimal number 2018707825 into its binary form. This can be done by repeatedly dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder. The binary representation is constructed by reading the remainders from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Binary Conversion Process:**\n   - Divide 2018707825 by 2, the quotient is 1009353912 and the remainder is 1.\n   - Divide 1009353912 by 2, the quotient is 504676956 and the remainder is 0.\n   - Divide 504676956 by 2, the quotient is 252338478 and the remainder is 0.\n   - Divide 252338478 by 2, the quotient is 126169239 and the remainder is 0.\n   - Divide 126169239 by 2, the quotient is 63084619 and the remainder is 1.\n   - Continue this process until the quotient is 0.\n\n3. **Construct the Binary Representation:**\n   - By following the division and remainder process, the binary representation of 2018707825 is obtained as: `1111000000000000000000000000001`.\n\n4. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - In the binary representation `1111000000000000000000000000001`, count the number of 1s.\n   - The binary string has four 1s at the beginning and one 1 at the end.\n\n5. **Calculate the Total Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Add the number of 1s: 4 (at the beginning) + 1 (at the end) = 5.\n\nTherefore, the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 2018707825 is 5.\n\nFinal answer: <<<5>>>."
