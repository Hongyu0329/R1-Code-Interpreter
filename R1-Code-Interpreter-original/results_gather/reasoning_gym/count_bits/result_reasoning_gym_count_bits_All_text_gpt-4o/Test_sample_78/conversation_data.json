    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 2006312278, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, convert the decimal number 2006312278 to its binary form. This can be done by repeatedly dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder. The binary representation is constructed by reading the remainders from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 2006312278 and divide by 2:\n     - 2006312278 ÷ 2 = 1003156139, remainder 0\n     - 1003156139 ÷ 2 = 501578069, remainder 1\n     - 501578069 ÷ 2 = 250789034, remainder 1\n     - 250789034 ÷ 2 = 125394517, remainder 0\n     - 125394517 ÷ 2 = 62697258, remainder 1\n     - 62697258 ÷ 2 = 31348629, remainder 0\n     - 31348629 ÷ 2 = 15674314, remainder 1\n     - 15674314 ÷ 2 = 7837157, remainder 0\n     - 7837157 ÷ 2 = 3918578, remainder 1\n     - 3918578 ÷ 2 = 1959289, remainder 0\n     - 1959289 ÷ 2 = 979644, remainder 1\n     - 979644 ÷ 2 = 489822, remainder 0\n     - 489822 ÷ 2 = 244911, remainder 0\n     - 244911 ÷ 2 = 122455, remainder 1\n     - 122455 ÷ 2 = 61227, remainder 1\n     - 61227 ÷ 2 = 30613, remainder 1\n     - 30613 ÷ 2 = 15306, remainder 1\n     - 15306 ÷ 2 = 7653, remainder 0\n     - 7653 ÷ 2 = 3826, remainder 1\n     - 3826 ÷ 2 = 1913, remainder 0\n     - 1913 ÷ 2 = 956, remainder 1\n     - 956 ÷ 2 = 478, remainder 0\n     - 478 ÷ 2 = 239, remainder 0\n     - 239 ÷ 2 = 119, remainder 1\n     - 119 ÷ 2 = 59, remainder 1\n     - 59 ÷ 2 = 29, remainder 1\n     - 29 ÷ 2 = 14, remainder 1\n     - 14 ÷ 2 = 7, remainder 0\n     - 7 ÷ 2 = 3, remainder 1\n     - 3 ÷ 2 = 1, remainder 1\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0, remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 2006312278 is: \n     1110111101101101011011011010110\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, count the number of 1s in the binary representation:\n     - 1110111101101101011011011010110\n     - Count each 1: There are 19 ones in this binary string.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 2006312278 is 19.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<19>>>"
