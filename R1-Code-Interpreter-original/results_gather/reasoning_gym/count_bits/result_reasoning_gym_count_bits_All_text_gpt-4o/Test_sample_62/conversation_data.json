    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 1174247400, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, convert the decimal number 1174247400 into its binary form. This can be done by repeatedly dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder. The binary representation is constructed by reading the remainders from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 1174247400 and divide by 2:\n     - 1174247400 ÷ 2 = 587123700, remainder 0\n     - 587123700 ÷ 2 = 293561850, remainder 0\n     - 293561850 ÷ 2 = 146780925, remainder 0\n     - 146780925 ÷ 2 = 73390462, remainder 1\n     - 73390462 ÷ 2 = 36695231, remainder 0\n     - 36695231 ÷ 2 = 18347615, remainder 1\n     - 18347615 ÷ 2 = 9173807, remainder 1\n     - 9173807 ÷ 2 = 4586903, remainder 1\n     - 4586903 ÷ 2 = 2293451, remainder 1\n     - 2293451 ÷ 2 = 1146725, remainder 1\n     - 1146725 ÷ 2 = 573362, remainder 1\n     - 573362 ÷ 2 = 286681, remainder 0\n     - 286681 ÷ 2 = 143340, remainder 1\n     - 143340 ÷ 2 = 71670, remainder 0\n     - 71670 ÷ 2 = 35835, remainder 0\n     - 35835 ÷ 2 = 17917, remainder 1\n     - 17917 ÷ 2 = 8958, remainder 1\n     - 8958 ÷ 2 = 4479, remainder 0\n     - 4479 ÷ 2 = 2239, remainder 1\n     - 2239 ÷ 2 = 1119, remainder 1\n     - 1119 ÷ 2 = 559, remainder 1\n     - 559 ÷ 2 = 279, remainder 1\n     - 279 ÷ 2 = 139, remainder 1\n     - 139 ÷ 2 = 69, remainder 1\n     - 69 ÷ 2 = 34, remainder 1\n     - 34 ÷ 2 = 17, remainder 0\n     - 17 ÷ 2 = 8, remainder 1\n     - 8 ÷ 2 = 4, remainder 0\n     - 4 ÷ 2 = 2, remainder 0\n     - 2 ÷ 2 = 1, remainder 0\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0, remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 1174247400 is: \n     1000100001100000000000000101000\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - In the binary representation 1000100001100000000000000101000, count the number of 1s.\n   - The binary string has 6 ones.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 1174247400 is 6.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<6>>>"
