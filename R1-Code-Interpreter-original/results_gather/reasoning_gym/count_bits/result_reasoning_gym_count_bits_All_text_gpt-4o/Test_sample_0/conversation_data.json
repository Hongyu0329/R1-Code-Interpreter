    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 166262002, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Decimal Number to Binary:**\n   - The first step is to convert the decimal number 166262002 into its binary form. This involves dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder, then repeating the process with the quotient until the quotient is 0. The binary representation is obtained by reading the remainders from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 166262002:\n     - 166262002 ÷ 2 = 83131001 remainder 0\n     - 83131001 ÷ 2 = 41565500 remainder 1\n     - 41565500 ÷ 2 = 20782750 remainder 0\n     - 20782750 ÷ 2 = 10391375 remainder 0\n     - 10391375 ÷ 2 = 5195687 remainder 1\n     - 5195687 ÷ 2 = 2597843 remainder 1\n     - 2597843 ÷ 2 = 1298921 remainder 1\n     - 1298921 ÷ 2 = 649460 remainder 1\n     - 649460 ÷ 2 = 324730 remainder 0\n     - 324730 ÷ 2 = 162365 remainder 0\n     - 162365 ÷ 2 = 81182 remainder 1\n     - 81182 ÷ 2 = 40591 remainder 0\n     - 40591 ÷ 2 = 20295 remainder 1\n     - 20295 ÷ 2 = 10147 remainder 1\n     - 10147 ÷ 2 = 5073 remainder 1\n     - 5073 ÷ 2 = 2536 remainder 1\n     - 2536 ÷ 2 = 1268 remainder 0\n     - 1268 ÷ 2 = 634 remainder 0\n     - 634 ÷ 2 = 317 remainder 0\n     - 317 ÷ 2 = 158 remainder 1\n     - 158 ÷ 2 = 79 remainder 0\n     - 79 ÷ 2 = 39 remainder 1\n     - 39 ÷ 2 = 19 remainder 1\n     - 19 ÷ 2 = 9 remainder 1\n     - 9 ÷ 2 = 4 remainder 1\n     - 4 ÷ 2 = 2 remainder 0\n     - 2 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 0\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 166262002 is: `100111101100110111101110010`.\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, we need to count the number of 1s in the binary representation `100111101100110111101110010`.\n   - By counting, we find there are 18 ones in this binary string.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 166262002 is 18.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<18>>>"
