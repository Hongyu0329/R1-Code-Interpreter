    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 904186430, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - The first step is to convert the decimal number 904186430 into its binary form. This involves dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder, then continuing with the quotient until the quotient is 0. The binary representation is the sequence of remainders read in reverse order.\n\n2. **Count the 1 Bits:**\n   - Once we have the binary representation, we need to count the number of 1s in this binary string. Each 1 represents a bit that is set in the binary representation.\n\n3. **Verification:**\n   - Double-check the conversion and counting to ensure accuracy.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Convert to Binary\n- Start with the number 904186430.\n- Divide by 2, record the remainder, and continue with the quotient.\n- Continue this process until the quotient is 0.\n\nThe binary representation of 904186430 is: `1101101111011111111011111111110`.\n\n### Step 2: Count the 1 Bits\n- In the binary string `1101101111011111111011111111110`, count the number of 1s.\n\n### Step 3: Verification\n- Double-check the binary conversion and the count of 1s to ensure no mistakes were made.\n\nAfter counting the 1s in the binary representation, we find there are 25 ones.\n\nTherefore, the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 904186430 is:\n\n<<<25>>>"
