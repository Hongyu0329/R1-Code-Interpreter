    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 1846252774, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, we need to convert the decimal number 1846252774 into its binary form. This can be done by repeatedly dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder. The binary representation is constructed by reading the remainders from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 1846252774 and divide by 2:\n     - 1846252774 ÷ 2 = 923126387 remainder 0\n     - 923126387 ÷ 2 = 461563193 remainder 1\n     - 461563193 ÷ 2 = 230781596 remainder 1\n     - 230781596 ÷ 2 = 115390798 remainder 0\n     - 115390798 ÷ 2 = 57695399 remainder 0\n     - 57695399 ÷ 2 = 28847699 remainder 1\n     - 28847699 ÷ 2 = 14423849 remainder 1\n     - 14423849 ÷ 2 = 7211924 remainder 1\n     - 7211924 ÷ 2 = 3605962 remainder 0\n     - 3605962 ÷ 2 = 1802981 remainder 0\n     - 1802981 ÷ 2 = 901490 remainder 1\n     - 901490 ÷ 2 = 450745 remainder 0\n     - 450745 ÷ 2 = 225372 remainder 1\n     - 225372 ÷ 2 = 112686 remainder 0\n     - 112686 ÷ 2 = 56343 remainder 0\n     - 56343 ÷ 2 = 28171 remainder 1\n     - 28171 ÷ 2 = 14085 remainder 1\n     - 14085 ÷ 2 = 7042 remainder 1\n     - 7042 ÷ 2 = 3521 remainder 0\n     - 3521 ÷ 2 = 1760 remainder 1\n     - 1760 ÷ 2 = 880 remainder 0\n     - 880 ÷ 2 = 440 remainder 0\n     - 440 ÷ 2 = 220 remainder 0\n     - 220 ÷ 2 = 110 remainder 0\n     - 110 ÷ 2 = 55 remainder 0\n     - 55 ÷ 2 = 27 remainder 1\n     - 27 ÷ 2 = 13 remainder 1\n     - 13 ÷ 2 = 6 remainder 1\n     - 6 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 0\n     - 3 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 1\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 1846252774 is: \n     1101110001101101011101010110110\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, we need to count the number of 1s in the binary representation.\n   - The binary number 1101110001101101011101010110110 contains the following 1s:\n     - 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0\n   - Counting the 1s, we find there are 18 ones.\n\nTherefore, the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 1846252774 is 18.\n\n<<<18>>>"
