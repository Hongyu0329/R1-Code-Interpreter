    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 194,003,353, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - The first step is to convert the decimal number 194,003,353 into its binary form. This involves dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder, then continuing with the quotient until the quotient is 0. The binary representation is the sequence of remainders read in reverse order.\n\n2. **Count the 1 Bits:**\n   - Once we have the binary representation, we need to count the number of 1s in this binary string. Each 1 represents a bit that is set in the binary form of the number.\n\n3. **Verification:**\n   - Double-check the binary conversion and the count of 1s to ensure accuracy.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n- **Step 1: Convert 194,003,353 to Binary**\n  - Perform successive divisions by 2, keeping track of the remainders:\n    - 194,003,353 ÷ 2 = 97,001,676 remainder 1\n    - 97,001,676 ÷ 2 = 48,500,838 remainder 0\n    - 48,500,838 ÷ 2 = 24,250,419 remainder 0\n    - 24,250,419 ÷ 2 = 12,125,209 remainder 1\n    - 12,125,209 ÷ 2 = 6,062,604 remainder 1\n    - 6,062,604 ÷ 2 = 3,031,302 remainder 0\n    - 3,031,302 ÷ 2 = 1,515,651 remainder 0\n    - 1,515,651 ÷ 2 = 757,825 remainder 1\n    - 757,825 ÷ 2 = 378,912 remainder 1\n    - 378,912 ÷ 2 = 189,456 remainder 0\n    - 189,456 ÷ 2 = 94,728 remainder 0\n    - 94,728 ÷ 2 = 47,364 remainder 0\n    - 47,364 ÷ 2 = 23,682 remainder 0\n    - 23,682 ÷ 2 = 11,841 remainder 0\n    - 11,841 ÷ 2 = 5,920 remainder 1\n    - 5,920 ÷ 2 = 2,960 remainder 0\n    - 2,960 ÷ 2 = 1,480 remainder 0\n    - 1,480 ÷ 2 = 740 remainder 0\n    - 740 ÷ 2 = 370 remainder 0\n    - 370 ÷ 2 = 185 remainder 0\n    - 185 ÷ 2 = 92 remainder 1\n    - 92 ÷ 2 = 46 remainder 0\n    - 46 ÷ 2 = 23 remainder 0\n    - 23 ÷ 2 = 11 remainder 1\n    - 11 ÷ 2 = 5 remainder 1\n    - 5 ÷ 2 = 2 remainder 1\n    - 2 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 0\n    - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n  - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 194,003,353 is: \n    - 1011100011110101111011011001\n\n- **Step 2: Count the 1 Bits**\n  - In the binary string 1011100011110101111011011001, count the number of 1s:\n    - There are 18 ones in this binary representation.\n\n- **Step 3: Verification**\n  - Double-check the binary conversion and the count to ensure no mistakes were made.\n\nThe final answer, after verifying the steps, is:\n\n<<<18>>>"
