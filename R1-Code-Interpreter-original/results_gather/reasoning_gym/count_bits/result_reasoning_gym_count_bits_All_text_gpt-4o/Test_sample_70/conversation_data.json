    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 318195239, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, convert the decimal number 318195239 into its binary form. This involves dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder, then repeating the process with the quotient until the quotient is zero. The binary representation is the sequence of remainders read in reverse order.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 318195239:\n     - 318195239 ÷ 2 = 159097619 remainder 1\n     - 159097619 ÷ 2 = 79548809 remainder 1\n     - 79548809 ÷ 2 = 39774404 remainder 1\n     - 39774404 ÷ 2 = 19887202 remainder 0\n     - 19887202 ÷ 2 = 9943601 remainder 0\n     - 9943601 ÷ 2 = 4971800 remainder 1\n     - 4971800 ÷ 2 = 2485900 remainder 0\n     - 2485900 ÷ 2 = 1242950 remainder 0\n     - 1242950 ÷ 2 = 621475 remainder 0\n     - 621475 ÷ 2 = 310737 remainder 1\n     - 310737 ÷ 2 = 155368 remainder 1\n     - 155368 ÷ 2 = 77684 remainder 0\n     - 77684 ÷ 2 = 38842 remainder 0\n     - 38842 ÷ 2 = 19421 remainder 0\n     - 19421 ÷ 2 = 9710 remainder 1\n     - 9710 ÷ 2 = 4855 remainder 0\n     - 4855 ÷ 2 = 2427 remainder 1\n     - 2427 ÷ 2 = 1213 remainder 1\n     - 1213 ÷ 2 = 606 remainder 1\n     - 606 ÷ 2 = 303 remainder 0\n     - 303 ÷ 2 = 151 remainder 1\n     - 151 ÷ 2 = 75 remainder 1\n     - 75 ÷ 2 = 37 remainder 1\n     - 37 ÷ 2 = 18 remainder 1\n     - 18 ÷ 2 = 9 remainder 0\n     - 9 ÷ 2 = 4 remainder 1\n     - 4 ÷ 2 = 2 remainder 0\n     - 2 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 0\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 318195239 is: \n     1001011111011111111011110110111\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, count the number of 1s in the binary representation:\n     - 1001011111011111111011110110111\n     - Count each '1' in the sequence.\n\n4. **Perform the Count:**\n   - There are 23 '1' bits in the binary representation of 318195239.\n\nTherefore, the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 318195239 is 23.\n\n<<<23>>>"
