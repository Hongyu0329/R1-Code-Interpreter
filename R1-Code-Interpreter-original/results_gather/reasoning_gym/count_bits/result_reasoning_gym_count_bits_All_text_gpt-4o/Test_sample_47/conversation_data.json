    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 312107031, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, convert the decimal number 312107031 to its binary form. This can be done by repeatedly dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder. The binary representation is constructed by reading the remainders from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 312107031 and divide by 2:\n     - 312107031 ÷ 2 = 156053515 remainder 1\n     - 156053515 ÷ 2 = 78026757 remainder 1\n     - 78026757 ÷ 2 = 39013378 remainder 1\n     - 39013378 ÷ 2 = 19506689 remainder 0\n     - 19506689 ÷ 2 = 9753344 remainder 1\n     - 9753344 ÷ 2 = 4876672 remainder 0\n     - 4876672 ÷ 2 = 2438336 remainder 0\n     - 2438336 ÷ 2 = 1219168 remainder 0\n     - 1219168 ÷ 2 = 609584 remainder 0\n     - 609584 ÷ 2 = 304792 remainder 0\n     - 304792 ÷ 2 = 152396 remainder 0\n     - 152396 ÷ 2 = 76198 remainder 0\n     - 76198 ÷ 2 = 38099 remainder 0\n     - 38099 ÷ 2 = 19049 remainder 1\n     - 19049 ÷ 2 = 9524 remainder 1\n     - 9524 ÷ 2 = 4762 remainder 0\n     - 4762 ÷ 2 = 2381 remainder 0\n     - 2381 ÷ 2 = 1190 remainder 1\n     - 1190 ÷ 2 = 595 remainder 0\n     - 595 ÷ 2 = 297 remainder 1\n     - 297 ÷ 2 = 148 remainder 1\n     - 148 ÷ 2 = 74 remainder 0\n     - 74 ÷ 2 = 37 remainder 0\n     - 37 ÷ 2 = 18 remainder 1\n     - 18 ÷ 2 = 9 remainder 0\n     - 9 ÷ 2 = 4 remainder 1\n     - 4 ÷ 2 = 2 remainder 0\n     - 2 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 0\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 312107031 is: `1001010011111111111111110110111`.\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, count the number of 1s in the binary representation `1001010011111111111111110110111`.\n   - The binary string has the following 1s: `1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1`.\n\n4. **Calculate the Total:**\n   - There are 21 occurrences of the digit 1 in the binary representation.\n\nTherefore, the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 312107031 is 21.\n\n<<<21>>>"
