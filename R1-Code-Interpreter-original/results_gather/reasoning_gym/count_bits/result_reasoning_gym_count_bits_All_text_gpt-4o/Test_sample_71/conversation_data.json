    "To determine how many 1 bits are in the binary representation of the number 2102494121, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert the Number to Binary:**\n   - First, convert the decimal number 2102494121 into its binary form. This can be done by repeatedly dividing the number by 2 and recording the remainder. The binary representation is constructed by reading the remainders from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Perform the Conversion:**\n   - Start with 2102494121 and divide by 2:\n     - 2102494121 ÷ 2 = 1051247060 remainder 1\n     - 1051247060 ÷ 2 = 525623530 remainder 0\n     - 525623530 ÷ 2 = 262811765 remainder 0\n     - 262811765 ÷ 2 = 131405882 remainder 1\n     - 131405882 ÷ 2 = 65702941 remainder 0\n     - 65702941 ÷ 2 = 32851470 remainder 1\n     - 32851470 ÷ 2 = 16425735 remainder 0\n     - 16425735 ÷ 2 = 8212867 remainder 1\n     - 8212867 ÷ 2 = 4106433 remainder 1\n     - 4106433 ÷ 2 = 2053216 remainder 1\n     - 2053216 ÷ 2 = 1026608 remainder 0\n     - 1026608 ÷ 2 = 513304 remainder 0\n     - 513304 ÷ 2 = 256652 remainder 0\n     - 256652 ÷ 2 = 128326 remainder 0\n     - 128326 ÷ 2 = 64163 remainder 0\n     - 64163 ÷ 2 = 32081 remainder 1\n     - 32081 ÷ 2 = 16040 remainder 1\n     - 16040 ÷ 2 = 8020 remainder 0\n     - 8020 ÷ 2 = 4010 remainder 0\n     - 4010 ÷ 2 = 2005 remainder 0\n     - 2005 ÷ 2 = 1002 remainder 1\n     - 1002 ÷ 2 = 501 remainder 0\n     - 501 ÷ 2 = 250 remainder 1\n     - 250 ÷ 2 = 125 remainder 0\n     - 125 ÷ 2 = 62 remainder 1\n     - 62 ÷ 2 = 31 remainder 0\n     - 31 ÷ 2 = 15 remainder 1\n     - 15 ÷ 2 = 7 remainder 1\n     - 7 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 1\n     - 3 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 1\n     - 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1\n\n   - Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the binary representation of 2102494121 is: \n     1111101001111111111111111101001\n\n3. **Count the Number of 1 Bits:**\n   - Now, count the number of 1s in the binary representation:\n     - 1111101001111111111111111101001\n     - There are 24 ones in this binary string.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The number of 1 bits in the binary representation of 2102494121 is 24.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<24>>>"
