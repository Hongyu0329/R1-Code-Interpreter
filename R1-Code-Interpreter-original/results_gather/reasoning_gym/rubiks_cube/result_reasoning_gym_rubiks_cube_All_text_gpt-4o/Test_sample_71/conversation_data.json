    "To solve a 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube, we will follow a standard method, such as the CFOP (Cross, F2L, OLL, PLL) method. The goal is to solve the cube step by step, ensuring each layer is completed before moving to the next. Here is a step-by-step analysis and solution:\n\n1. **Solve the White Cross:**\n   - Identify the white center piece and align the white edge pieces with their corresponding center colors on the adjacent faces.\n   - Use basic moves to position the white edges correctly.\n\n2. **Solve the White Corners:**\n   - Position the white corner pieces in their correct locations using the R U R' U' algorithm until all white corners are solved.\n\n3. **Solve the Middle Layer Edges:**\n   - Use the F2L (First Two Layers) method to insert the edge pieces into the middle layer.\n   - Use algorithms like U R U' R' U' F' U F to position the edges correctly.\n\n4. **Solve the Yellow Cross:**\n   - Form a yellow cross on the top face using the F R U R' U' F' algorithm.\n\n5. **Position the Yellow Edges:**\n   - Use the U R U' L' U R' U' L algorithm to position the yellow edges correctly.\n\n6. **Position the Yellow Corners:**\n   - Use the U R U' L' U R' U' L algorithm to position the yellow corners correctly.\n\n7. **Orient the Yellow Corners:**\n   - Use the R U R' U R U2 R' algorithm to orient the yellow corners correctly.\n\n8. **Final Permutation of the Yellow Layer:**\n   - Use the U R U' L' U R' U' L algorithm to complete the cube.\n\nBy following these steps, the cube will be solved. Here is the solution in Singmaster notation:\n\n<<<\nF R U R' U' F' U R U' L' U R' U' L U R U' L' U R' U' L R U R' U R U2 R' U R U' L' U R' U' L\n>>>"
