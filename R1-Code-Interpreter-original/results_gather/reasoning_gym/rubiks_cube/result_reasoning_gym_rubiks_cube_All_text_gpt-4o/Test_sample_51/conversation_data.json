    "To solve the Rubik's Cube, we will follow a standard method, such as the CFOP method, which involves solving the cube in layers. The steps are as follows:\n\n1. **Cross on the First Layer**: Solve the cross on the first layer, ensuring that the edge pieces match the center colors on adjacent sides.\n\n2. **First Layer Corners**: Position and orient the corner pieces of the first layer.\n\n3. **Second Layer Edges**: Solve the edge pieces of the second layer.\n\n4. **Cross on the Last Layer**: Form a cross on the last layer.\n\n5. **Position Last Layer Edges**: Position the edge pieces of the last layer correctly.\n\n6. **Position Last Layer Corners**: Position the corner pieces of the last layer correctly.\n\n7. **Orient Last Layer Corners**: Orient the corner pieces of the last layer.\n\n8. **Orient Last Layer Edges**: Orient the edge pieces of the last layer.\n\nGiven the complexity of solving a Rubik's Cube and the need for a detailed step-by-step solution using Singmaster notation, it is important to note that the solution can vary depending on the initial state of the cube. The provided cube state needs to be analyzed to determine the exact sequence of moves required.\n\nHowever, without the ability to execute code or simulate the cube's state, providing a precise solution in Singmaster notation is not feasible in this format. Typically, solving a Rubik's Cube involves a series of algorithms that are applied based on the cube's current configuration.\n\nFor a detailed solution, it is recommended to use a Rubik's Cube solver tool or software that can take the initial state of the cube and provide the exact sequence of moves needed to solve it.\n\nTherefore, the final answer, given the constraints, is:\n\n<<<The solution requires a detailed analysis of the cube's current state and application of specific algorithms, which is best achieved using a Rubik's Cube solver tool.>>>"
