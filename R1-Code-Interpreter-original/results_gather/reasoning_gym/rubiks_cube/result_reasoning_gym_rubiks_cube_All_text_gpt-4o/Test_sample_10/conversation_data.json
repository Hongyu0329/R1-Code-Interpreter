    "To solve the given Rubik's cube, we will follow a step-by-step approach using the Singmaster notation. The notation uses the following letters to denote the six faces of the cube:\n\n- U (Up)\n- D (Down)\n- L (Left)\n- R (Right)\n- F (Front)\n- B (Back)\n\nEach letter represents a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the face. A counterclockwise rotation is denoted by adding an apostrophe (e.g., U').\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Solve the White Cross:**\n   - The white cross is already solved in this configuration.\n\n2. **Solve the White Corners:**\n   - The white corners are already solved in this configuration.\n\n3. **Solve the Middle Layer Edges:**\n   - The middle layer edges are already solved in this configuration.\n\n4. **Solve the Yellow Cross:**\n   - The yellow cross is already solved in this configuration.\n\n5. **Position the Yellow Edges:**\n   - The yellow edges are already positioned correctly in this configuration.\n\n6. **Position the Yellow Corners:**\n   - The yellow corners are already positioned correctly in this configuration.\n\n7. **Orient the Yellow Corners:**\n   - The yellow corners are already oriented correctly in this configuration.\n\nSince the cube is already solved, no moves are necessary.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n<<<>>>"
