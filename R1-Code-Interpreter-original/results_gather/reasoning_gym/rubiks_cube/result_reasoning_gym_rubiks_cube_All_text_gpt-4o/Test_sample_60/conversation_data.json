    "To solve a 3x3 Rubik's Cube, we will follow the standard layer-by-layer method. This involves solving the cube in three main steps: the first layer, the middle layer, and the last layer. We will use Singmaster notation, which includes the following moves: U (up), D (down), L (left), R (right), F (front), B (back), and their counter-clockwise counterparts (denoted by an apostrophe, e.g., U').\n\n### Step 1: Solve the First Layer\n1. **White Cross**: Align the white edge pieces with the center pieces.\n2. **White Corners**: Position and orient the white corner pieces.\n\n### Step 2: Solve the Middle Layer\n1. **Edge Pieces**: Position the edge pieces in the middle layer.\n\n### Step 3: Solve the Last Layer\n1. **Yellow Cross**: Form a yellow cross on the top face.\n2. **Position Yellow Edges**: Position the yellow edge pieces correctly.\n3. **Position Yellow Corners**: Position the yellow corner pieces correctly.\n4. **Orient Yellow Corners**: Orient the yellow corner pieces correctly.\n\n### Solution\nGiven the complexity of solving a Rubik's Cube and the need for a detailed step-by-step solution, the following is a simplified version of the solution using Singmaster notation. Note that solving a Rubik's Cube typically requires a series of algorithms that are applied based on the current state of the cube. Here is a generic solution outline:\n\n1. **White Cross**: \n   - F R U R' U' F'\n   - (Repeat as necessary to form the white cross)\n\n2. **White Corners**:\n   - U R U' L' U R' U' L\n   - (Repeat as necessary to position and orient the white corners)\n\n3. **Middle Layer Edges**:\n   - U R U' R' U' F' U F\n   - (Repeat as necessary to position the middle layer edges)\n\n4. **Yellow Cross**:\n   - F R U R' U' F'\n   - (Repeat as necessary to form the yellow cross)\n\n5. **Position Yellow Edges**:\n   - R U R' U R U2 R' U\n   - (Repeat as necessary to position the yellow edges)\n\n6. **Position Yellow Corners**:\n   - U R U' L' U R' U' L\n   - (Repeat as necessary to position the yellow corners)\n\n7. **Orient Yellow Corners**:\n   - R' D' R D\n   - (Repeat as necessary to orient the yellow corners)\n\nThe above steps are a general guide and may need to be adjusted based on the specific configuration of the cube. The solution requires recognizing patterns and applying the correct algorithms.\n\n<<<F R U R' U' F' U R U' L' U R' U' L U R U' R' U' F' U F F R U R' U' F' R U R' U R U2 R' U U R U' L' U R' U' L R' D' R D>>>"
