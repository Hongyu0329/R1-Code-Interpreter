    "To solve the given Rubik's Cube, we will follow a step-by-step approach using the CFOP method (Cross, F2L, OLL, PLL). The cube is described in a scrambled state, and we need to solve it using Singmaster notation, which involves the following moves: U (Up), D (Down), L (Left), R (Right), F (Front), B (Back), and their respective counter-clockwise and double moves.\n\n### Step 1: Solve the White Cross\n1. Identify the white edge pieces and align them with their respective center colors.\n2. Use U, D, L, R, F, B moves to position the white edges correctly.\n\n### Step 2: Solve the White Corners\n1. Position the white corner pieces in their correct locations.\n2. Use R U R' U' or similar algorithms to orient the corners correctly.\n\n### Step 3: Solve the Middle Layer Edges\n1. Identify the edge pieces that belong in the middle layer.\n2. Use algorithms like U R U' R' U' F' U F to position the edges correctly.\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Yellow Cross\n1. Use F R U R' U' F' to form a yellow cross on the top face.\n\n### Step 5: Position the Yellow Edges\n1. Use U R U' L' U R' U' L to position the yellow edges correctly.\n\n### Step 6: Position the Yellow Corners\n1. Use U R U' L' U R' U' L to position the yellow corners correctly.\n\n### Step 7: Orient the Yellow Corners\n1. Use R U R' U R U2 R' to orient the yellow corners correctly.\n\n### Step 8: Final Permutation of the Cube\n1. Use algorithms like R U R' U R U2 R' U to complete the cube.\n\nGiven the complexity of the task and the need for a specific sequence of moves, the solution will be a series of moves in Singmaster notation. However, without the ability to visualize or simulate the cube, providing an exact sequence of moves is challenging. The solution requires iterative adjustments based on the cube's state after each move.\n\n<<<\nF R U R' U' F' U R U' L' U R' U' L U R U' L' U R' U' L R U R' U R U2 R' U\n>>>"
