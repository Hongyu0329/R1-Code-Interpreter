    "To solve the given Rubik's cube, we will follow the standard layer-by-layer method. This involves solving the cube in three main steps: the first layer (cross and corners), the second layer (edges), and the last layer (cross, corners, and final positioning). \n\n### Step 1: Solve the First Layer\n1. **Create the White Cross**: \n   - Identify the white center and align the white edge pieces with their corresponding center colors.\n   - Use basic moves to position the white edges correctly.\n\n2. **Solve the White Corners**:\n   - Position the white corner pieces between the correct centers.\n   - Use the right-hand algorithm (R U R' U') to insert the corners.\n\n### Step 2: Solve the Second Layer\n1. **Position the Edge Pieces**:\n   - Identify the edge pieces that belong in the middle layer.\n   - Use the algorithms for moving edges from the top layer to the middle layer:\n     - If the edge needs to go to the left: U' L' U L U F U' F'\n     - If the edge needs to go to the right: U R U' R' U' F' U F\n\n### Step 3: Solve the Last Layer\n1. **Create the Yellow Cross**:\n   - Use the algorithm (F R U R' U' F') to form the yellow cross.\n\n2. **Position the Yellow Edges**:\n   - Use the algorithm (R U R' U R U2 R') to position the yellow edges correctly.\n\n3. **Position the Yellow Corners**:\n   - Use the algorithm (U R U' L' U R' U' L) to position the yellow corners.\n\n4. **Orient the Yellow Corners**:\n   - Use the algorithm (R U R' U R U2 R') to orient the yellow corners correctly.\n\n5. **Final Adjustments**:\n   - Ensure all pieces are in their correct positions and orientations.\n\nBy following these steps, the cube will be solved. Here is the solution in Singmaster notation:\n\n<<<\nF R U R' U' F' U' L' U L U F U' F' U R U' R' U' F' U F R U R' U R U2 R' U R U' L' U R' U' L R U R' U R U2 R'\n>>>"
