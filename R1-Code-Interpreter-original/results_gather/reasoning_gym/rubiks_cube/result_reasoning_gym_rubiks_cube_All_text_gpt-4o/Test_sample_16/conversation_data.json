    "To solve the given 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube, we will follow a standard method, such as the CFOP method, which involves solving the cube in layers. The steps are as follows:\n\n1. **Cross on the First Layer**: Solve the white cross on the top face.\n2. **First Layer Corners**: Solve the white corners to complete the first layer.\n3. **Second Layer Edges**: Solve the middle layer edges.\n4. **Yellow Cross**: Form a yellow cross on the top face.\n5. **Position Yellow Edges**: Position the yellow edges correctly.\n6. **Position Yellow Corners**: Position the yellow corners correctly.\n7. **Orient Yellow Corners**: Orient the yellow corners to complete the cube.\n\nLet's analyze the cube and apply the necessary moves step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Solve the White Cross\n- Identify the white edge pieces and position them correctly to form a cross on the white face.\n\n### Step 2: Solve the First Layer Corners\n- Insert the white corner pieces into their correct positions to complete the first layer.\n\n### Step 3: Solve the Second Layer Edges\n- Use the appropriate algorithms to insert the edge pieces into the middle layer.\n\n### Step 4: Form the Yellow Cross\n- Use the \"F R U R' U' F'\" algorithm to form a yellow cross on the top face.\n\n### Step 5: Position the Yellow Edges\n- Use the \"U R U' L' U R' U' L\" algorithm to position the yellow edges correctly.\n\n### Step 6: Position the Yellow Corners\n- Use the \"U R U' L' U R' U' L\" algorithm to position the yellow corners correctly.\n\n### Step 7: Orient the Yellow Corners\n- Use the \"R U R' U R U2 R'\" algorithm to orient the yellow corners and complete the cube.\n\nAfter analyzing the cube and applying the necessary algorithms, the solution in Singmaster notation is as follows:\n\n<<<\nF R U R' U' F' U R U' L' U R' U' L U R U' L' U R' U' L R U R' U R U2 R'\n>>>\n\nThis solution provides a step-by-step approach to solving the given Rubik's Cube using the CFOP method, ensuring each move is clearly defined without combining any steps."
