    "To solve the given Rubik's Cube, we will follow a step-by-step approach using the CFOP method (Cross, F2L, OLL, PLL). The cube is described in a 2D format, and we will use Singmaster notation to describe the moves. The notation is as follows:\n\n- U (Up face clockwise)\n- D (Down face clockwise)\n- L (Left face clockwise)\n- R (Right face clockwise)\n- F (Front face clockwise)\n- B (Back face clockwise)\n- Each move can be followed by an apostrophe (') to indicate a counterclockwise turn.\n\n### Step 1: Solve the White Cross\n1. Identify the white edge pieces and position them correctly on the white face.\n2. Align the edge pieces with the center pieces of the adjacent faces.\n\n### Step 2: Solve the First Two Layers (F2L)\n1. Pair the corner and edge pieces and insert them into their correct positions in the first two layers.\n\n### Step 3: Orient the Last Layer (OLL)\n1. Make all the pieces on the top face the same color (yellow in this case).\n\n### Step 4: Permute the Last Layer (PLL)\n1. Position the last layer pieces correctly to solve the cube.\n\nGiven the complexity of solving a Rubik's Cube and the need for a specific sequence of moves, the solution will be a series of moves that follow the CFOP method. However, without the ability to visualize and manipulate the cube directly, providing an exact sequence of moves is challenging. Instead, I will outline a general approach:\n\n1. **White Cross:**\n   - Identify and position the white edge pieces.\n   - Use moves like F, R, U, L, and D to align the white edges with their corresponding center pieces.\n\n2. **First Two Layers (F2L):**\n   - Pair up the white corner pieces with the corresponding edge pieces.\n   - Insert them into the correct positions using sequences like U R U' R' and similar variations.\n\n3. **Orient the Last Layer (OLL):**\n   - Use algorithms to orient the yellow pieces on the top face.\n   - Common algorithms include F R U R' U' F' and others.\n\n4. **Permute the Last Layer (PLL):**\n   - Use algorithms to position the last layer pieces correctly.\n   - Common algorithms include U R U' L' U R' U' L and others.\n\nSince the exact sequence of moves depends on the initial state of the cube, and without a visual tool to manipulate the cube, providing a precise solution is not feasible. However, the above steps outline the general approach to solving the cube.\n\nFor a specific solution, you would typically use a Rubik's Cube solver or software that can take the initial state and provide a step-by-step solution.\n\n<<<The solution requires a specific sequence of moves based on the initial state, which is best determined using a Rubik's Cube solver tool.>>>"
