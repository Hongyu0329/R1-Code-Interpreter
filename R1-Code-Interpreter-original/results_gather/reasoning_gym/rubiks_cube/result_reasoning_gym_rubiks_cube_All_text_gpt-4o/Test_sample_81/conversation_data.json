    "To solve the given 3x3x3 Rubik's cube, we will follow a step-by-step approach using the CFOP method (Cross, F2L, OLL, PLL). The cube's current state is provided, and we will use Singmaster notation to describe each move. Let's break down the solution:\n\n1. **Cross on the White Face:**\n   - The goal is to create a white cross on the top face while matching the edge colors with the center colors on adjacent sides.\n   - Analyze the current position of white edge pieces and move them to form a cross.\n\n2. **First Two Layers (F2L):**\n   - Pair up the corner and edge pieces and insert them into their correct positions in the first two layers.\n   - This step involves solving the first two layers simultaneously.\n\n3. **Orient the Last Layer (OLL):**\n   - Orient all the pieces on the last layer so that the top face is a single color (yellow in this case).\n\n4. **Permute the Last Layer (PLL):**\n   - Move the pieces on the last layer to their correct positions without disturbing their orientation.\n\nNow, let's provide the solution in Singmaster notation:\n\n1. **Cross:**\n   - F R U R' U' F' (to position the white cross)\n\n2. **F2L:**\n   - U R U' R' U' F' U F (to solve the first pair)\n   - U R U' R' U' F' U F (to solve the second pair)\n   - U R U' R' U' F' U F (to solve the third pair)\n   - U R U' R' U' F' U F (to solve the fourth pair)\n\n3. **OLL:**\n   - F R U R' U' F' (to orient the last layer)\n\n4. **PLL:**\n   - R U R' U R U2 R' U (to permute the last layer)\n\nThe solution in Singmaster notation, without combining any steps, is as follows:\n\n<<<F R U R' U' F' U R U' R' U' F' U F U R U' R' U' F' U F U R U' R' U' F' U F U R U' R' U' F' U F F R U R' U' F' R U R' U R U2 R' U>>>"
