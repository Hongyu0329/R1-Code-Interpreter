    "To solve the given 3x3x3 Rubik's cube, we will follow a standard method, such as the CFOP (Cross, F2L, OLL, PLL) method. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Cross on the White Face**: \n   - First, we need to form a white cross on the top face. This involves positioning the white edge pieces correctly with their corresponding center colors.\n\n2. **First Two Layers (F2L)**:\n   - Solve the first two layers by inserting the corner and edge pairs into their correct positions.\n\n3. **Orient the Last Layer (OLL)**:\n   - Orient all the pieces on the last layer so that the top face is a single color (yellow in this case).\n\n4. **Permute the Last Layer (PLL)**:\n   - Finally, permute the last layer pieces to complete the cube.\n\nGiven the complexity of the cube's current state, a detailed step-by-step solution in Singmaster notation is required. Here is a possible solution:\n\n1. **White Cross**:\n   - F R U R' U' F'\n\n2. **First Two Layers (F2L)**:\n   - U R U' R' U' F' U F\n   - U' L' U L U F U' F'\n   - U R U' R' U' F' U F\n   - U' L' U L U F U' F'\n\n3. **Orient the Last Layer (OLL)**:\n   - F R U R' U' F'\n   - U R U R' U R U2 R'\n\n4. **Permute the Last Layer (PLL)**:\n   - U R U' L' U R' U' L\n   - U2 R U R' U R U2 R'\n\nThe solution in Singmaster notation, without combining any steps, is as follows:\n\n<<<F R U R' U' F' U R U' R' U' F' U F U' L' U L U F U' F' U R U' R' U' F' U F U' L' U L U F U' F' F R U R' U' F' U R U R' U R U2 R' U R U' L' U R' U' L U2 R U R' U R U2 R'>>>"
