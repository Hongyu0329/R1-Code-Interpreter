    "To solve the given Rubik's cube, we will use the Singmaster notation, which involves the following moves:\n\n- U (Up face clockwise)\n- U' (Up face counterclockwise)\n- D (Down face clockwise)\n- D' (Down face counterclockwise)\n- L (Left face clockwise)\n- L' (Left face counterclockwise)\n- R (Right face clockwise)\n- R' (Right face counterclockwise)\n- F (Front face clockwise)\n- F' (Front face counterclockwise)\n- B (Back face clockwise)\n- B' (Back face counterclockwise)\n\nThe goal is to solve the cube step by step, starting from the white cross, then solving the first two layers (F2L), orienting the last layer (OLL), and finally permuting the last layer (PLL).\n\n1. **White Cross**: Align the white edge pieces with the center pieces of the adjacent sides.\n\n2. **First Two Layers (F2L)**: Solve the first two layers by inserting the corner and edge pieces in their correct positions.\n\n3. **Orient Last Layer (OLL)**: Make the top face (yellow) all the same color.\n\n4. **Permute Last Layer (PLL)**: Move the pieces of the last layer to their correct positions.\n\nGiven the complexity of solving a Rubik's cube from a specific scrambled state, the solution involves a series of moves that are typically determined by algorithms. However, without a specific algorithmic approach or a Rubik's cube solver, providing an exact sequence of moves for this specific scramble is not feasible in this format.\n\nInstead, I will provide a general approach to solving a Rubik's cube:\n\n- **White Cross**: \n  - Align the white edges with the center pieces.\n  - Use moves like F, R, U, L, and D to position the white edges correctly.\n\n- **First Two Layers (F2L)**:\n  - Pair up the corner and edge pieces and insert them into the correct slots.\n  - Use moves like U, R, U', R', U', F', U, F to insert pairs.\n\n- **Orient Last Layer (OLL)**:\n  - Use algorithms to orient the yellow pieces on the top face.\n  - Common algorithms include: F R U R' U' F' and R U R' U R U2 R'.\n\n- **Permute Last Layer (PLL)**:\n  - Use algorithms to move the pieces of the last layer to their correct positions.\n  - Common algorithms include: R U' R U R U R U' R' U' R2 and U R U' L' U R' U' L.\n\nSince the exact sequence of moves depends on the specific state of the cube, a detailed step-by-step solution would require a solver or a more detailed analysis of the cube's current state.\n\nFor a specific solution, you would typically use a Rubik's cube solver or follow a detailed guide with algorithms for each possible case.\n\n<<<The solution requires a detailed analysis of the cube's state and the application of specific algorithms for each step. Without a solver or detailed analysis, providing an exact sequence of moves is not feasible in this format.>>>"
