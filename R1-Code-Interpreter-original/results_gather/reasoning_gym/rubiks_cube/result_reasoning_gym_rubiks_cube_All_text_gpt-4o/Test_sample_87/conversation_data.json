    "To solve the given Rubik's cube, we will follow a step-by-step approach using the CFOP method (Cross, F2L, OLL, PLL). The cube is represented in a 2D format, and we will use Singmaster notation to describe the moves. The notation includes:\n\n- U (Up face clockwise)\n- U' (Up face counterclockwise)\n- D (Down face clockwise)\n- D' (Down face counterclockwise)\n- L (Left face clockwise)\n- L' (Left face counterclockwise)\n- R (Right face clockwise)\n- R' (Right face counterclockwise)\n- F (Front face clockwise)\n- F' (Front face counterclockwise)\n- B (Back face clockwise)\n- B' (Back face counterclockwise)\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Cross on the White Face:**\n   - Identify the white edges and position them correctly on the white face to form a cross.\n\n2. **First Two Layers (F2L):**\n   - Pair the corner and edge pieces and insert them into their correct positions in the first two layers.\n\n3. **Orient the Last Layer (OLL):**\n   - Make the top face (yellow) all the same color.\n\n4. **Permute the Last Layer (PLL):**\n   - Move the pieces of the last layer to their correct positions.\n\nGiven the complexity of solving a Rubik's cube from a specific scrambled state, the solution requires a detailed analysis of the current state and a series of moves to solve it. However, without executing the moves on a physical or virtual cube, providing an exact sequence of moves is challenging. Instead, I will provide a general approach to solving the cube.\n\n### General Approach:\n\n- **Cross:** Solve the white cross on the top face.\n- **F2L:** Solve the first two layers by inserting corner-edge pairs.\n- **OLL:** Use algorithms to orient the last layer pieces.\n- **PLL:** Use algorithms to permute the last layer pieces.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nSince the exact sequence of moves depends on the specific state of the cube, and without the ability to execute and verify each move, a precise solution cannot be provided here. However, the general approach outlined above can be used to solve the cube using standard Rubik's cube solving techniques.\n\n<<<The solution requires a detailed analysis of the current state and a series of moves to solve it, which cannot be precisely provided without executing the moves on a physical or virtual cube. Follow the CFOP method: Cross, F2L, OLL, PLL.>>>"
