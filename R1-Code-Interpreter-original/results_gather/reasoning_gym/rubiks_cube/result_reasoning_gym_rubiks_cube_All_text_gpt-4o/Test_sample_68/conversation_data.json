    "To solve the given 3x3x3 Rubik's cube, we will follow a step-by-step approach using the Singmaster notation. The Singmaster notation uses the following letters to denote the six faces of the cube:\n\n- U (Up)\n- D (Down)\n- L (Left)\n- R (Right)\n- F (Front)\n- B (Back)\n\nEach letter represents a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the face. A counterclockwise rotation is denoted by adding an apostrophe (e.g., U').\n\nThe solution involves several stages, including solving the cross, corners, middle layer edges, and finally the last layer. Here is a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Solve the White Cross:**\n   - Align the white edge pieces with the center pieces of the adjacent sides.\n\n2. **Solve the White Corners:**\n   - Position the white corner pieces correctly using the R U R' U' algorithm.\n\n3. **Solve the Middle Layer Edges:**\n   - Use the F U R U' R' F' algorithm to position the middle layer edge pieces.\n\n4. **Solve the Yellow Cross:**\n   - Form a yellow cross on the top face using the F R U R' U' F' algorithm.\n\n5. **Position the Yellow Edges:**\n   - Use the U R U' L' U R' U' L algorithm to position the yellow edge pieces correctly.\n\n6. **Position the Yellow Corners:**\n   - Use the U R U' L' U R' U' L algorithm to position the yellow corner pieces.\n\n7. **Orient the Yellow Corners:**\n   - Use the R U R' U R U2 R' algorithm to orient the yellow corner pieces correctly.\n\nFollowing these steps, the solution to the given Rubik's cube is:\n\n<<<\nF R U R' U' F' U R U' L' U R' U' L R U R' U R U2 R' F U R U' R' U R U' R' F' U R U' L' U R' U' L\n>>>"
