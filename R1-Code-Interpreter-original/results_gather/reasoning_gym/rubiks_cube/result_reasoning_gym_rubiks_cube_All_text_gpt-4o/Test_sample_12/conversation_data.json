    "To solve the Rubik's Cube, we will follow a standard layer-by-layer method. The steps are as follows:\n\n1. **Solve the White Cross**: Align the white edge pieces with the center pieces of the adjacent sides.\n2. **Solve the White Corners**: Position and orient the white corner pieces.\n3. **Solve the Middle Layer Edges**: Position the edge pieces in the middle layer.\n4. **Solve the Yellow Cross**: Form a yellow cross on the top face.\n5. **Position the Yellow Edges**: Align the yellow edge pieces with the correct center pieces.\n6. **Position the Yellow Corners**: Place the yellow corner pieces in their correct positions.\n7. **Orient the Yellow Corners**: Rotate the yellow corner pieces to complete the cube.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Solve the White Cross\n- Identify the white edge pieces and move them to form a cross on the white face.\n\n### Step 2: Solve the White Corners\n- Position the white corner pieces by moving them to the top layer and using sequences to place them correctly.\n\n### Step 3: Solve the Middle Layer Edges\n- Use the appropriate algorithms to move the edge pieces from the top layer to the middle layer.\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Yellow Cross\n- Use the \"F R U R' U' F'\" algorithm to form a yellow cross on the top face.\n\n### Step 5: Position the Yellow Edges\n- Use the \"R U R' U R U2 R' U\" algorithm to position the yellow edges correctly.\n\n### Step 6: Position the Yellow Corners\n- Use the \"U R U' L' U R' U' L\" algorithm to position the yellow corners.\n\n### Step 7: Orient the Yellow Corners\n- Use the \"R' D' R D\" algorithm to orient the yellow corners correctly.\n\nNow, let's provide the solution in Singmaster notation:\n\n<<<\nF R U R' U' F' U R U' L' U R' U' L U R U' L' U R' U' L R' D' R D R' D' R D\n>>>"
