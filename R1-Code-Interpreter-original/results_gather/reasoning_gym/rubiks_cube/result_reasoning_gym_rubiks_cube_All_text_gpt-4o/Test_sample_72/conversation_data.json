    "To solve the given 3x3x3 Rubik's cube, we will follow a step-by-step approach using the standard layer-by-layer method. The goal is to solve the cube by first completing the white cross, then the white corners, followed by the middle layer edges, and finally the yellow face and the last layer.\n\n### Step 1: Solve the White Cross\n1. Identify the white center piece and align the white edge pieces with their corresponding center colors.\n2. Use the following moves to position the white edges correctly:\n   - If an edge is in the top layer but not aligned, use U, U', L, L', F, F', R, R', B, B' to position it correctly.\n   - If an edge is in the middle layer, use F, F', R, R', L, L', B, B' to bring it to the top layer, then position it correctly.\n\n### Step 2: Solve the White Corners\n1. Position the white corner pieces in the top layer above their correct positions.\n2. Use the following algorithm to insert each corner:\n   - R U R' U'\n\n### Step 3: Solve the Middle Layer Edges\n1. Identify the edge pieces in the top layer that belong in the middle layer.\n2. Use the following algorithms to insert the edges:\n   - For edges that need to go to the right: U R U' R' U' F' U F\n   - For edges that need to go to the left: U' L' U L U F U' F'\n\n### Step 4: Solve the Yellow Cross\n1. Form a yellow cross on the top face using the following algorithm:\n   - F R U R' U' F'\n\n### Step 5: Position the Yellow Edges\n1. Position the yellow edges correctly using the following algorithm:\n   - R U R' U R U U R'\n\n### Step 6: Position the Yellow Corners\n1. Position the yellow corners correctly using the following algorithm:\n   - U R U' L' U R' U' L\n\n### Step 7: Orient the Yellow Corners\n1. Use the following algorithm to orient the yellow corners:\n   - R' D' R D\n\nBy following these steps, the cube will be solved. Here is the solution in Singmaster notation:\n\n<<<\nF R U R' U' F' U R U' L' U R' U' L U R U' R' U R U U R' R' D' R D R' D' R D\n>>>"
