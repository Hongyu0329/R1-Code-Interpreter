    "To solve a Rubik's Cube, we need to follow a series of steps that involve manipulating the cube's faces to achieve a uniform color on each face. The Singmaster notation is a standard notation used to describe the moves on a Rubik's Cube. The notation consists of the following moves:\n\n- U (Up): Rotate the top face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- D (Down): Rotate the bottom face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- L (Left): Rotate the left face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- R (Right): Rotate the right face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- F (Front): Rotate the front face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- B (Back): Rotate the back face 90 degrees clockwise.\n\nEach move can also be followed by an apostrophe (') to indicate a counterclockwise rotation, or the move can be repeated to indicate multiple rotations (e.g., U U for a 180-degree rotation).\n\nGiven the current state of the cube, we need to determine a sequence of moves that will solve the cube. This is a complex problem that typically requires a Rubik's Cube solving algorithm or software to compute efficiently. \n\nLet's use a Python script to simulate a Rubik's Cube solver that can provide the solution in Singmaster notation. We'll use a library that can handle the cube's state and provide the solution.\n\n```python\n# Importing the necessary library\nfrom rubik_solver import utils\n\n# Define the current state of the cube\n# The state is represented as a string with each face's colors in order:\n# U (Up), R (Right), F (Front), D (Down), L (Left), B (Back)\n# The colors are represented by their initials: W (White), Y (Yellow), R (Red), O (Orange), G (Green), B (Blue)\n\ncube_state = (\n    \"OYO\"  # Up face\n    \"WYB\"\n    \"OOO\"\n    \"BRB\"  # Right face\n    \"YGY\"\n    \"BRY\"\n    \"YGY\"  # Front face\n    \"GOR\"\n    \"YOR\"\n    \"RGW\"  # Down face\n    \"RWW\"\n    \"RYR\"\n    \"BRB\"  # Left face\n    \"YGY\"\n    \"BRY\"\n    \"GOG\"  # Back face\n    \"WBW\"\n    \"WBW\"\n)\n\n# Solve the cube\nsolution = utils.solve(cube_state, 'Kociemba')\n\n# Print the solution in Singmaster notation\nprint(' '.join(solution))\n```\n\nThis script uses the `rubik_solver` library to solve the cube. The `solve` function takes the cube's current state and returns a list of moves in Singmaster notation. The solution is then printed as a space-separated string of moves.\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the sequence of moves needed to solve the cube.",
    "The error indicates that the `rubik_solver` library is not installed in the current environment. This library is typically used to solve Rubik's Cube problems programmatically. However, since we cannot install new libraries in this environment, we need to approach the problem differently.\n\nGiven the complexity of solving a Rubik's Cube, especially from a random state, it is usually best handled by specialized algorithms or solvers. However, I can provide a general outline of the steps involved in solving a Rubik's Cube manually, which can be translated into Singmaster notation:\n\n1. **Solve the White Cross**: Align the white edge pieces with the center pieces.\n2. **Solve the White Corners**: Position the white corner pieces correctly.\n3. **Solve the Middle Layer Edges**: Position the edge pieces in the middle layer.\n4. **Solve the Yellow Cross**: Form a yellow cross on the top face.\n5. **Position the Yellow Edges**: Align the yellow edge pieces with the correct center pieces.\n6. **Position the Yellow Corners**: Place the yellow corners in the correct position.\n7. **Orient the Yellow Corners**: Rotate the yellow corners to complete the cube.\n\nEach of these steps involves a series of moves that can be expressed in Singmaster notation. However, without a solver or a detailed manual process, providing an exact sequence of moves for the given cube state is not feasible here.\n\nFor a specific solution, you would typically use a Rubik's Cube solver tool or software that can take the current state of the cube and output the exact sequence of moves needed to solve it.\n\nIf you have access to a Rubik's Cube solver tool, you can input the current state of the cube and obtain the solution in Singmaster notation. Alternatively, you can manually solve the cube using the outlined steps and translate your moves into Singmaster notation.\n\nIf you need further assistance or a different approach, please let me know!"
