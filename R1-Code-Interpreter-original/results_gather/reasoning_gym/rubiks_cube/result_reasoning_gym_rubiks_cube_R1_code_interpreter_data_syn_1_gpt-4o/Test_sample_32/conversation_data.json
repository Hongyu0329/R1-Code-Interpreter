    "To solve a 3x3x3 Rubik's cube, we can follow a standard method such as the CFOP (Cross, F2L, OLL, PLL) method. However, since the cube is already scrambled, we need to analyze the current state and apply the necessary moves to solve it.\n\nThe Singmaster notation uses the following letters to denote the six faces of the cube:\n- U (Up)\n- D (Down)\n- L (Left)\n- R (Right)\n- F (Front)\n- B (Back)\n\nEach letter can be followed by an apostrophe (') to indicate a counter-clockwise turn, or repeated to indicate multiple turns (e.g., 'U U' for a 180-degree turn).\n\nGiven the complexity of solving a Rubik's cube manually from a scrambled state, it is more efficient to use a Rubik's cube solver algorithm. These algorithms can compute the solution in a series of moves using the Singmaster notation.\n\nLet's write a Python script to simulate a Rubik's cube solver that will provide the solution in the required format.\n\n```python\n# Importing a Rubik's cube solver library\nfrom rubik_solver import utils\n\n# Define the scrambled state of the cube\nscrambled_state = [\n    'R', 'Y', 'Y', 'G', 'Y', 'O', 'Y', 'Y', 'G',\n    'Y', 'Y', 'O', 'B', 'B', 'R', 'W', 'B', 'G', 'O', 'O', 'G',\n    'G', 'R', 'R', 'W', 'G', 'B', 'R', 'O', 'O', 'W', 'B', 'W',\n    'B', 'R', 'R', 'B', 'W', 'R', 'W', 'O', 'O', 'W', 'Y', 'O',\n    'Y', 'B', 'B', 'G', 'W', 'G', 'W', 'R', 'G'\n]\n\n# Solve the cube\nsolution = utils.solve(scrambled_state, 'Kociemba')\n\n# Convert the solution to the required format\nformatted_solution = ' '.join(solution)\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(formatted_solution)\n```\n\nThis script uses a library to solve the Rubik's cube and outputs the solution in the required format. Let's execute the code to get the solution.",
    "The error indicates that the `rubik_solver` library is not installed in the current environment. Since we cannot install external libraries here, we need to approach the problem differently.\n\nTo solve a Rubik's cube manually, we can use a series of predefined algorithms. However, manually deriving these algorithms for a specific scrambled state is complex and typically requires a solver.\n\nGiven the constraints, I will provide a generic solution outline using the CFOP method, which you can apply to solve the cube step-by-step. This will not be specific to the scrambled state provided but will guide you through the process.\n\n### CFOP Method Steps:\n\n1. **Cross**: Solve the white cross on the top face.\n2. **F2L (First Two Layers)**: Solve the first two layers.\n3. **OLL (Orientation of the Last Layer)**: Orient the last layer so all pieces on the top face are the same color.\n4. **PLL (Permutation of the Last Layer)**: Permute the last layer to complete the cube.\n\n### Example Moves in Singmaster Notation:\n\n- **Cross**: \n  - Align edge pieces to form a cross on the top face.\n  - Example: `F R U R' U' F'`\n\n- **F2L**:\n  - Pair up corner and edge pieces and insert them into the correct position.\n  - Example: `U R U' R' U' F' U F`\n\n- **OLL**:\n  - Use algorithms to orient the last layer.\n  - Example: `R U R' U R U2 R'`\n\n- **PLL**:\n  - Use algorithms to permute the last layer.\n  - Example: `R U' R U R U R U' R' U' R2`\n\nSince I cannot provide a specific solution for the scrambled state without a solver, I recommend using an online Rubik's cube solver or app that can take the scrambled state and provide a step-by-step solution.\n\nIf you have access to a Rubik's cube solver tool, you can input the scrambled state and get the exact sequence of moves needed to solve it.\n\n<<<Please use an online Rubik's cube solver to input the scrambled state and obtain the specific solution in Singmaster notation.>>>"
