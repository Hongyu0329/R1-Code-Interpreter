The solution involves following a series of steps using Singmaster notation: 
1. White Cross: F R U R' U' F'
2. White Corners: U R U' L' U R' U' L
3. Middle Layer Edges: U R U' R' U' F' U F
4. Yellow Cross: F R U R' U' F'
5. Position Yellow Corners: U R U' L' U R' U' L
6. Orient Yellow Corners: R U R' U R U2 R'
7. Position Yellow Edges: U R U' L' U R' U' L
This is a generic beginner's method and may need adjustments based on the specific cube state.
