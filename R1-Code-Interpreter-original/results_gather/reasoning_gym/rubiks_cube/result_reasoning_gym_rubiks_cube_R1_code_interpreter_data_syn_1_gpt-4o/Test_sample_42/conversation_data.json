    "To solve a Rubik's Cube, we need to follow a series of steps that involve manipulating the cube's faces using specific moves. The Singmaster notation is a standard way to describe these moves, where each letter represents a 90-degree clockwise rotation of a face:\n\n- U (Up)\n- D (Down)\n- L (Left)\n- R (Right)\n- F (Front)\n- B (Back)\n\nA counterclockwise rotation is denoted by adding an apostrophe (e.g., U' for a counterclockwise rotation of the Up face).\n\nGiven the complexity of solving a Rubik's Cube, especially from a specific scrambled state, it is often more efficient to use a computer algorithm to determine the sequence of moves required to solve it. There are several algorithms available, such as the CFOP method, which is commonly used by speedcubers.\n\nTo solve the cube from the given scrambled state, I will use a Python script that utilizes a Rubik's Cube solving library. This script will take the scrambled state as input and output the sequence of moves in Singmaster notation.\n\n```python\nfrom rubik_solver import utils\n\n# Define the scrambled state of the cube\nscrambled_state = [\n    'G', 'Y', 'G', 'G', 'Y', 'B', 'B', 'Y', 'B',  # Top face\n    'R', 'R', 'O', 'W', 'G', 'Y', 'O', 'O', 'R', 'W', 'B', 'Y',  # Middle layer\n    'R', 'R', 'O', 'W', 'G', 'Y', 'O', 'O', 'R', 'W', 'B', 'Y',  # Middle layer\n    'R', 'R', 'O', 'W', 'B', 'Y', 'O', 'O', 'R', 'W', 'G', 'Y',  # Middle layer\n    'G', 'W', 'G', 'B', 'W', 'G', 'B', 'W', 'B'   # Bottom face\n]\n\n# Solve the cube\nsolution = utils.solve(scrambled_state, 'Kociemba')\n\n# Print the solution in Singmaster notation\nprint(' '.join(solution))\n```\n\nThis script uses the `rubik_solver` library, which implements the Kociemba algorithm to find an optimal solution for the Rubik's Cube. The `solve` function takes the scrambled state and the desired solving method as input and returns the solution as a list of moves.\n\nLet's execute the code to get the solution.",
    "The error indicates that the `rubik_solver` library is not installed in the current environment. Since I cannot install packages or run code that requires external libraries in this environment, I will provide an alternative approach.\n\nTo solve the Rubik's Cube manually, we can follow a step-by-step method. However, given the complexity of manually solving a Rubik's Cube from a specific scrambled state, it is typically more efficient to use a solver or a dedicated Rubik's Cube solving application.\n\nFor the sake of this exercise, I will outline a general approach to solving a Rubik's Cube using the CFOP method, which involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Cross**: Solve the white cross on the top face.\n2. **F2L (First Two Layers)**: Solve the first two layers.\n3. **OLL (Orientation of the Last Layer)**: Orient the last layer so that all pieces on the top face are the same color.\n4. **PLL (Permutation of the Last Layer)**: Permute the last layer to complete the cube.\n\nSince providing a detailed step-by-step solution for the given scrambled state is not feasible without a solver, I recommend using an online Rubik's Cube solver or a mobile app where you can input the scrambled state and receive a step-by-step solution in Singmaster notation.\n\nIf you have access to a Rubik's Cube solver, you can input the scrambled state and obtain the solution. Alternatively, if you have any specific questions about solving techniques or need further assistance, feel free to ask!"
