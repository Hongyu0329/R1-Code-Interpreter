# This script uses the kociemba library to solve a Rubik's Cube.
# The library must be installed in your Python environment.

import kociemba

# Define the scrambled state of the cube in kociemba format.
# The format is a string of 54 characters representing the cube's state.
# Each character represents a color: U (Up), D (Down), L (Left), R (Right), F (Front), B (Back).
# The provided state must be converted to this format.

# Example scrambled state (not the one provided, as it needs conversion):
scrambled_state = 'UUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRFFFFFFFFFDDDDDDDDDLLLLLLLLLBBBBBBBBB'

# Solve the cube
solution = kociemba.solve(scrambled_state)

# Print the solution
print(solution)
