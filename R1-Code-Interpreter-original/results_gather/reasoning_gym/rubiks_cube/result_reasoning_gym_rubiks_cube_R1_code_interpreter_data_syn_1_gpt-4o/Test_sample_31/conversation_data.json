    "To solve a Rubik's Cube using Singmaster notation, we need to follow a series of steps that involve solving the cube layer by layer. The Singmaster notation uses the following moves:\n\n- U (Up)\n- D (Down)\n- L (Left)\n- R (Right)\n- F (Front)\n- B (Back)\n\nEach move can be clockwise or counterclockwise, and a move can be repeated. In this case, we will not combine any steps, so 'U2' will be written as 'U U'.\n\nThe process to solve a Rubik's Cube typically involves the following steps:\n\n1. Solve the first layer (cross and corners).\n2. Solve the middle layer (edges).\n3. Solve the last layer (cross, corners, and final positioning).\n\nGiven the complexity of solving a Rubik's Cube and the specific arrangement provided, it is not feasible to manually derive the solution step-by-step here. Instead, I will use a Python script to compute the solution using a Rubik's Cube solver library.\n\nLet's write a Python script to solve the cube using the given configuration.\n\n```python\nfrom rubik_solver import utils\n\n# Define the cube configuration\n# The cube is represented in a string format where each face is represented by a single letter\n# The order of faces is: U (Up), R (Right), F (Front), D (Down), L (Left), B (Back)\n# The given configuration is translated into this format\ncube_configuration = (\n    \"RYG\"  # U face\n    \"BYR\"\n    \"WYR\"\n    \"GRG\"  # R face\n    \"GGO\"\n    \"YBW\"\n    \"GRO\"  # F face\n    \"RGO\"\n    \"RBB\"\n    \"WWO\"  # D face\n    \"WWO\"\n    \"BBY\"\n    \"GYO\"  # L face\n    \"RGY\"\n    \"YBB\"\n    \"YBO\"  # B face\n    \"YOW\"\n    \"WGO\"\n)\n\n# Solve the cube\nsolution = utils.solve(cube_configuration, 'Kociemba')\n\n# Print the solution in Singmaster notation\nprint(' '.join(solution))\n```\n\nThis script uses the `rubik_solver` library to solve the cube. The cube configuration is provided in a specific string format, and the solution is computed using the Kociemba algorithm. The solution is then printed in Singmaster notation.\n\nOnce the code is executed, the solution will be provided.",
    "The error indicates that the `rubik_solver` library is not installed in the current environment. Since I cannot install packages or run code that requires external libraries in this environment, I will provide an alternative approach.\n\nTo solve a Rubik's Cube manually, we can use a series of algorithms that are well-documented. However, given the complexity and the specific arrangement, manually deriving the solution step-by-step here is not feasible without a solver.\n\nInstead, I will provide a general outline of the steps involved in solving a Rubik's Cube, which you can follow or use with a Rubik's Cube solver tool:\n\n1. **Solve the White Cross**: Align the white edge pieces with the center pieces on the top face.\n2. **Solve the White Corners**: Position the white corner pieces correctly.\n3. **Solve the Middle Layer Edges**: Position the edge pieces in the middle layer.\n4. **Solve the Yellow Cross**: Form a yellow cross on the top face.\n5. **Position the Yellow Edges**: Align the yellow edge pieces with the correct center pieces.\n6. **Position the Yellow Corners**: Place the yellow corners in the correct position.\n7. **Orient the Yellow Corners**: Rotate the yellow corners to complete the cube.\n\nFor a specific solution to the given configuration, I recommend using an online Rubik's Cube solver where you can input the current state of the cube and receive a step-by-step solution in Singmaster notation.\n\nIf you have access to a Python environment where you can install packages, you can use the `rubik_solver` library or similar to compute the solution programmatically.\n\nSince I cannot provide a direct solution without executing the code, I recommend using the above steps or a solver tool to find the solution."
