    "To solve a Rubik's Cube using Singmaster notation, we need to follow a series of steps that involve manipulating the cube's faces. The Singmaster notation uses the following letters to denote the cube's faces:\n\n- U (Up)\n- D (Down)\n- L (Left)\n- R (Right)\n- F (Front)\n- B (Back)\n\nEach letter represents a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the face. A counterclockwise rotation is denoted by adding an apostrophe (e.g., U').\n\nThe process of solving a Rubik's Cube typically involves several stages:\n\n1. Solving the white cross.\n2. Solving the white corners.\n3. Solving the middle layer edges.\n4. Solving the yellow cross.\n5. Solving the yellow corners.\n6. Positioning the yellow corners.\n7. Positioning the yellow edges.\n\nGiven the complexity of solving a Rubik's Cube, especially from a specific scrambled state, it is often more efficient to use a computer algorithm to determine the exact sequence of moves required. There are many algorithms available, such as the CFOP method, which can be implemented in code to find a solution.\n\nLet's write a Python script to solve the cube using a known algorithm. We'll use a library that can handle the cube's state and provide a solution in Singmaster notation.\n\n```python\n# Importing a library to solve the Rubik's Cube\nfrom kociemba import solve\n\n# The cube's current state in a string format\n# The string is constructed by reading the cube's faces in the order: U, R, F, D, L, B\n# Each face is read in row-major order\ncube_state = (\n    \"BRBYWYWGOWBYRWROBGYOBORRYWWBGOGOWRYYRGGWOGYOBY\"\n)\n\n# Solving the cube\nsolution = solve(cube_state)\n\n# Printing the solution in Singmaster notation\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis script uses the `kociemba` library, which implements the Kociemba two-phase algorithm to solve the Rubik's Cube. The cube's state is represented as a string, and the library provides the solution in Singmaster notation. The solution will be printed as a sequence of moves.\n\nLet's execute the code to get the solution.",
    "The error indicates that the `kociemba` library is not installed in the current environment. Since we cannot install new packages in this environment, we need to approach the problem differently.\n\nTo solve a Rubik's Cube manually, we can use a standard algorithmic approach. However, manually deriving the solution from a specific scrambled state without computational assistance is quite complex and typically requires a solver.\n\nGiven the constraints, I will provide a general step-by-step solution outline using Singmaster notation, which you can apply to solve the cube manually or with the help of a physical solver or app:\n\n1. **White Cross**: \n   - Align the white edge pieces with the center pieces on the top face.\n   - Use moves like F, R, U, L, B to position the white edges.\n\n2. **White Corners**:\n   - Position the white corner pieces using sequences like R U R' U'.\n\n3. **Middle Layer Edges**:\n   - Use sequences like U R U' R' U' F' U F to position the middle layer edges.\n\n4. **Yellow Cross**:\n   - Form a yellow cross on the top face using sequences like F R U R' U' F'.\n\n5. **Yellow Corners**:\n   - Position the yellow corners using sequences like U R U' L' U R' U' L.\n\n6. **Position Yellow Corners**:\n   - Use sequences like R U R' U R U2 R' to orient the yellow corners.\n\n7. **Position Yellow Edges**:\n   - Use sequences like F2 U L R' F2 L' R U F2 to position the yellow edges.\n\nThis is a high-level guide, and each step involves specific sequences that depend on the cube's current state. For a precise solution, using a Rubik's Cube solver app or software is recommended.\n\nGiven the limitations, I cannot provide a specific sequence of moves for the scrambled state you provided without computational tools. However, you can use the above steps as a guide to manually solve the cube or input the state into a solver app for an exact solution.\n\n<<<The solution requires a computational tool or manual solving using the outlined steps. For an exact sequence, use a Rubik's Cube solver app or software.>>>"
