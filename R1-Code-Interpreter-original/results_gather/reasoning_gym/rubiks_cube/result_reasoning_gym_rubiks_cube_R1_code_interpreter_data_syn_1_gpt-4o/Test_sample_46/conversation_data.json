    "To solve a Rubik's Cube, we typically follow a series of steps that involve solving the cube layer by layer. The Singmaster notation is used to describe the moves on the cube, where:\n\n- U = Up face\n- D = Down face\n- L = Left face\n- R = Right face\n- F = Front face\n- B = Back face\n\nEach move can be clockwise (e.g., U) or counterclockwise (e.g., U').\n\nGiven the scrambled state of the cube, we need to determine the sequence of moves that will solve it. This is a complex problem that usually requires either a human solver with a good understanding of the cube or an algorithmic approach.\n\nTo solve this problem programmatically, we can use a known algorithm or library that can compute the solution for a given cube state. One such library is the `kociemba` Python library, which implements the two-phase algorithm to solve the Rubik's Cube.\n\nLet's write a Python script to use this library to find the solution for the given cube state. We'll represent the cube state in a format that the library can understand and then compute the solution.\n\n```python\n# Import the kociemba library\nimport kociemba\n\n# Define the scrambled cube state\n# The cube state is represented as a string of 54 characters, each representing a color on the cube.\n# The order is: U (Up), R (Right), F (Front), D (Down), L (Left), B (Back)\n# Colors: U=Y, R=R, F=G, D=W, L=O, B=B\n\nscrambled_state = (\n    \"YYYYYWB\"  # Up face\n    \"RRRGGWRROOBBB\"  # Right, Front, Left faces\n    \"OOWGWRROOBBY\"  # Down face\n    \"GYGGWWGWW\"  # Back face\n)\n\n# Find the solution using the kociemba library\nsolution = kociemba.solve(scrambled_state)\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis script will output the solution in Singmaster notation, which we can then format to avoid combining steps like 'U2'. Let's execute this code to find the solution.",
    "The error indicates that the `kociemba` library is not installed in the current environment. Since I cannot install packages or run code that requires external libraries in this environment, we need to approach this problem differently.\n\nTo solve the Rubik's Cube manually, we can follow a standard solving method, such as the CFOP method (Cross, F2L, OLL, PLL). However, manually deriving the solution from the given scrambled state without visualization tools or a solver is quite complex.\n\nInstead, I will provide a general outline of the steps involved in solving a Rubik's Cube using the CFOP method. This will not be specific to the given scrambled state but will serve as a guide for solving any 3x3 Rubik's Cube.\n\n1. **Cross**: Solve the white cross on the top face.\n2. **F2L (First Two Layers)**: Solve the first two layers by inserting corner-edge pairs.\n3. **OLL (Orientation of the Last Layer)**: Orient all the pieces on the last layer to make the top face a single color.\n4. **PLL (Permutation of the Last Layer)**: Permute the pieces on the last layer to complete the cube.\n\nEach of these steps involves a series of algorithms that are applied based on the current state of the cube.\n\nSince I cannot provide a specific solution without a solver, I recommend using an online Rubik's Cube solver or a mobile app that can take the cube's current state and provide a step-by-step solution in Singmaster notation.\n\nIf you have access to a Python environment where you can install packages, you can install the `kociemba` library using `pip install kociemba` and run the previous script to get the solution.\n\nFor now, here's a general guide to solving the cube:\n\n<<<\n1. Solve the white cross.\n2. Solve the first two layers (F2L).\n3. Orient the last layer (OLL).\n4. Permute the last layer (PLL).\nUse a Rubik's Cube solver for specific moves.\n>>>"
