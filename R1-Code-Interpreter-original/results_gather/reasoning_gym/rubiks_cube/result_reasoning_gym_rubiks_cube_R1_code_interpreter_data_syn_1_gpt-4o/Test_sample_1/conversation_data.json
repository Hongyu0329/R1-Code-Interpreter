    "To solve a Rubik's Cube, we need to follow a series of steps that will systematically bring the cube to its solved state. The Singmaster notation is used to describe the moves on the cube, where each face is represented by a letter: U (Up), D (Down), L (Left), R (Right), F (Front), B (Back). A move is a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the face, and a counterclockwise rotation is denoted by an apostrophe (e.g., U').\n\nGiven the current state of the cube, we need to determine the sequence of moves that will solve it. This involves several stages, such as solving the cross, corners, middle layer, and finally the last layer.\n\nTo find the solution, we can use a known algorithm or a solver that can compute the sequence of moves. Since this is a complex problem, let's use a Python script to find the solution using a Rubik's Cube solver library.\n\n```python\nfrom rubik_solver import utils\n\n# Define the current state of the cube using the color notation\n# The state is represented as a string of 54 characters, each representing a sticker\n# The order is: UUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRFFFFFFFFFDDDDDDDDDLLLLLLLLLBBBBBBBBB\n# Using the given cube state:\n# U: YYY YYY YYB\n# R: RRR RRR GGR\n# F: GGO GGO GGY\n# D: WWW OWW OWW\n# L: GGR GGR OOB\n# B: OOO BBB RRB\n\ncube_state = (\n    \"YYYYYYYYB\"  # U\n    \"RRRRRRGGR\"  # R\n    \"GGOGGOGGY\"  # F\n    \"WWWOWWOWW\"  # D\n    \"GGRGGROOB\"  # L\n    \"OOOBBBRRB\"  # B\n)\n\n# Solve the cube\nsolution = utils.solve(cube_state, 'Kociemba')\n\n# Print the solution in Singmaster notation\nprint(' '.join(solution))\n```\n\nThis script uses the `rubik_solver` library to find the solution to the given cube state. The `utils.solve` function computes the sequence of moves needed to solve the cube, and the result is printed in Singmaster notation.\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the sequence of moves to solve the cube. Let's execute the code to get the solution.",
    "The error indicates that the `rubik_solver` library is not installed in the current environment. Since we cannot install external libraries in this environment, we need to approach the problem differently.\n\nTo solve the Rubik's Cube manually, we can follow a standard method that involves solving the cube layer by layer. This method is often referred to as the CFOP method (Cross, F2L, OLL, PLL). However, without a solver, providing an exact sequence of moves for the given scrambled state is challenging.\n\nInstead, I will provide a general step-by-step guide using Singmaster notation to solve a Rubik's Cube. This guide will not be specific to the given scrambled state but will outline the process to solve any 3x3 Rubik's Cube.\n\n1. **Solve the White Cross:**\n   - Align the white edge pieces with the center pieces to form a cross on the white face.\n\n2. **Solve the White Corners:**\n   - Position the white corner pieces in their correct places.\n\n3. **Solve the Middle Layer Edges:**\n   - Use algorithms to position the edge pieces in the middle layer.\n\n4. **Solve the Yellow Cross:**\n   - Form a cross on the yellow face.\n\n5. **Position the Yellow Edges:**\n   - Use algorithms to position the yellow edge pieces correctly.\n\n6. **Position the Yellow Corners:**\n   - Use algorithms to position the yellow corner pieces correctly.\n\n7. **Orient the Yellow Corners:**\n   - Use algorithms to orient the yellow corner pieces correctly.\n\nSince I cannot provide a specific solution without a solver, I recommend using an online Rubik's Cube solver or a mobile app where you can input the current state of your cube to get the exact sequence of moves.\n\nIf you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!"
