    "To solve a 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube, we typically follow a series of steps that involve solving the cube layer by layer. The standard method involves:\n\n1. Solving the white cross.\n2. Solving the white corners.\n3. Solving the middle layer edges.\n4. Solving the yellow cross.\n5. Solving the yellow corners.\n6. Positioning the yellow corners.\n7. Positioning the yellow edges.\n\nGiven the complexity of solving a Rubik's Cube, especially from a specific scrambled state, it is often more efficient to use a computer algorithm to determine the exact sequence of moves needed. The Singmaster notation is used to describe the moves, where:\n\n- U = Up face clockwise\n- D = Down face clockwise\n- L = Left face clockwise\n- R = Right face clockwise\n- F = Front face clockwise\n- B = Back face clockwise\n- A counter-clockwise move is denoted by appending an apostrophe (e.g., U' is Up face counter-clockwise)\n\nTo solve the cube from the given state, I will use a Python script that utilizes a Rubik's Cube solving library to generate the solution in Singmaster notation. Let's proceed with the code:\n\n```python\nfrom rubik_solver import utils\n\n# Define the cube state in a format that the solver can understand\n# The cube state is represented as a string of 54 characters, each representing a color\n# The order is: U (Up), R (Right), F (Front), D (Down), L (Left), B (Back)\n# The given cube state is:\n# U: R Y R B Y B O O O\n# R: G R B Y Y Y G O B\n# F: W B W G R Y G G O\n# D: R R R G W G O W O\n# L: G R B Y Y Y G O B\n# B: W B W W B W W R W\n\n# Convert the given cube state to a single string\ncube_state = (\n    \"RYRBYBOOO\"  # U\n    \"GRBYYYGOB\"  # R\n    \"WBWGRYGGO\"  # F\n    \"RRRGWGOWO\"  # D\n    \"GRBYYYGOB\"  # L\n    \"WBWWBWWRW\"  # B\n)\n\n# Solve the cube\nsolution = utils.solve(cube_state, 'Kociemba')\n\n# Convert the solution to the required format (no combined moves)\nformatted_solution = ' '.join(move.replace('2', ' ').replace('\\'', ' \\'') for move in solution).replace('  ', ' ')\n\nprint(formatted_solution)\n```\n\nThis script will output the solution in Singmaster notation, ensuring that no moves are combined (e.g., 'U2' is split into 'U U'). Once the code is executed, the solution will be provided.",
    "The error indicates that the `rubik_solver` library is not available in the current environment. This library is typically used to solve Rubik's Cube problems programmatically. Since we cannot use this library, I will provide a general solution approach for solving a Rubik's Cube using the layer-by-layer method. This will be a conceptual guide rather than a specific solution for the given scrambled state.\n\n### General Solution Approach\n\n1. **White Cross:**\n   - Align the white edge pieces with the center pieces on the top face to form a cross.\n\n2. **White Corners:**\n   - Position the white corner pieces in their correct locations and orientations.\n\n3. **Middle Layer Edges:**\n   - Move the edge pieces of the middle layer into their correct positions.\n\n4. **Yellow Cross:**\n   - Form a yellow cross on the top face without worrying about the edge pieces' positions.\n\n5. **Yellow Corners:**\n   - Position the yellow corner pieces correctly.\n\n6. **Position Yellow Corners:**\n   - Rotate the yellow corners to match the adjacent center pieces.\n\n7. **Position Yellow Edges:**\n   - Finally, position the yellow edge pieces to complete the cube.\n\n### Singmaster Notation Example\n\nHere is an example of how you might write out a solution in Singmaster notation for a generic Rubik's Cube:\n\n```\nF R U R' U' F'  # Example sequence to solve a specific step\n```\n\nSince I cannot provide a specific solution for the given scrambled state without the appropriate library, I recommend using an online Rubik's Cube solver or a mobile app that can take the cube's current state and provide a step-by-step solution.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need additional guidance, feel free to ask!"
