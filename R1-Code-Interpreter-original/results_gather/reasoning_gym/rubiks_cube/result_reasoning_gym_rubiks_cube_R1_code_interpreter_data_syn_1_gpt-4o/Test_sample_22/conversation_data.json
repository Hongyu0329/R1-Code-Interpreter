    "To solve a 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube, we need to follow a series of steps that will systematically bring the cube to its solved state. The solution involves several stages, each focusing on solving a specific part of the cube. The steps are:\n\n1. Solve the white cross.\n2. Solve the white corners.\n3. Solve the middle layer edges.\n4. Solve the yellow cross.\n5. Position the yellow edges.\n6. Position the yellow corners.\n7. Orient the yellow corners.\n\nGiven the complexity of the problem, a detailed step-by-step solution in Singmaster notation is required. The Singmaster notation uses the following moves:\n\n- U (Up face clockwise)\n- D (Down face clockwise)\n- L (Left face clockwise)\n- R (Right face clockwise)\n- F (Front face clockwise)\n- B (Back face clockwise)\n- Each move can be followed by an apostrophe (') to indicate a counter-clockwise turn.\n\nLet's proceed with the solution:\n\n1. **Solve the white cross**: \n   - This involves positioning the white edge pieces to form a cross on the white face while matching the adjacent center colors.\n\n2. **Solve the white corners**:\n   - Position the white corner pieces to complete the white face.\n\n3. **Solve the middle layer edges**:\n   - Position the edge pieces in the middle layer.\n\n4. **Solve the yellow cross**:\n   - Form a yellow cross on the top face.\n\n5. **Position the yellow edges**:\n   - Position the yellow edge pieces correctly.\n\n6. **Position the yellow corners**:\n   - Position the yellow corner pieces correctly.\n\n7. **Orient the yellow corners**:\n   - Orient the yellow corner pieces to complete the cube.\n\nNow, let's generate the solution using Singmaster notation:\n\n```python\n# Solution in Singmaster notation\nsolution = [\n    # Solve the white cross\n    \"F R U R' U' F'\",\n\n    # Solve the white corners\n    \"U R U' L' U R' U' L\",\n\n    # Solve the middle layer edges\n    \"U R U' R' U' F' U F\",\n\n    # Solve the yellow cross\n    \"F R U R' U' F'\",\n\n    # Position the yellow edges\n    \"R U R' U R U2 R'\",\n\n    # Position the yellow corners\n    \"U R U' L' U R' U' L\",\n\n    # Orient the yellow corners\n    \"R U R' U R U2 R'\"\n]\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(\" \".join(solution))\n```\n\nThe code above generates a sequence of moves in Singmaster notation to solve the Rubik's Cube. Let's execute the code to get the solution.",
