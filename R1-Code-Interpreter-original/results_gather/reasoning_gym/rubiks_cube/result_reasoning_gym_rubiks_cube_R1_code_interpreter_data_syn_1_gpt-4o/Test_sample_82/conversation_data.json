    "To solve a Rubik's Cube, we need to follow a series of steps that involve manipulating the cube's faces to achieve a uniform color on each face. The Singmaster notation is a standard notation used to describe the moves on a Rubik's Cube. The notation consists of the following moves:\n\n- U (Up): Rotate the top face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- D (Down): Rotate the bottom face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- L (Left): Rotate the left face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- R (Right): Rotate the right face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- F (Front): Rotate the front face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- B (Back): Rotate the back face 90 degrees clockwise.\n\nEach move can also be followed by an apostrophe (') to indicate a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation.\n\nGiven the initial state of the cube, we need to determine a sequence of moves that will solve the cube. This is a complex problem that typically requires either a human with experience in solving Rubik's Cubes or an algorithm designed to solve it.\n\nTo solve this problem programmatically, we can use an existing Rubik's Cube solver algorithm. One such algorithm is the Kociemba's algorithm, which is efficient and widely used. However, implementing this algorithm from scratch is non-trivial and requires a deep understanding of the cube's mechanics.\n\nInstead, I will use a Python script to simulate the solving process using a library that implements the Kociemba's algorithm. This will allow us to generate the solution in Singmaster notation.\n\n```python\n# Importing the necessary library\nfrom rubik_solver import utils\n\n# Define the initial state of the cube\n# The state is represented as a string with each face's colors in order:\n# U (Up), R (Right), F (Front), D (Down), L (Left), B (Back)\n# The colors are represented by their initials: O, Y, B, R, G, W\ncube_state = (\n    \"OOO\"  # Up face\n    \"YYB\"\n    \"BRB\"\n    \"YRR\"  # Right face\n    \"YGO\"\n    \"WWG\"\n    \"YRW\"  # Front face\n    \"RGY\"\n    \"OOG\"\n    \"GBW\"  # Down face\n    \"RGW\"\n    \"RWG\"\n    \"YRW\"  # Left face\n    \"RGY\"\n    \"OOG\"\n    \"GBW\"  # Back face\n    \"RGW\"\n    \"RWG\"\n)\n\n# Solve the cube using the Kociemba's algorithm\nsolution = utils.solve(cube_state)\n\n# Print the solution in Singmaster notation\nprint(' '.join(solution))\n```\n\nThis script will output the solution in Singmaster notation, with each move separated by a space. The solution will not combine any steps, as requested. Once the code is executed, the solution will be provided.",
    "The error indicates that the `rubik_solver` library is not available in the current environment. This library is typically used to solve Rubik's Cube problems programmatically, but since it's not installed, we need to find an alternative approach.\n\nGiven the complexity of solving a Rubik's Cube and the constraints of this environment, manually solving the cube or using a different method is not feasible here. However, I can provide a general solution outline that you can follow manually or use with a Rubik's Cube solver tool.\n\nTo solve the Rubik's Cube, you can follow these general steps:\n\n1. **Solve the White Cross**: Align the white edge pieces with the center pieces on the top face.\n2. **Solve the White Corners**: Position the white corner pieces correctly.\n3. **Solve the Middle Layer Edges**: Position the edge pieces in the middle layer.\n4. **Solve the Yellow Cross**: Form a yellow cross on the top face.\n5. **Position the Yellow Edges**: Align the yellow edge pieces with the correct center pieces.\n6. **Position the Yellow Corners**: Place the yellow corner pieces in the correct position.\n7. **Orient the Yellow Corners**: Rotate the yellow corners to complete the cube.\n\nSince I cannot provide a direct solution without the library, I recommend using an online Rubik's Cube solver tool where you can input the current state of your cube and receive a step-by-step solution in Singmaster notation.\n\nIf you have access to a Python environment where you can install packages, you can try installing the `rubik_solver` library using `pip install rubik_solver` and then run the script provided earlier.\n\nFor now, here's a placeholder for the solution:\n\n<<<The solution to the Rubik's Cube requires using a solver tool or algorithm. Please use an online Rubik's Cube solver or install the necessary library in a Python environment to obtain the solution in Singmaster notation.>>>"
