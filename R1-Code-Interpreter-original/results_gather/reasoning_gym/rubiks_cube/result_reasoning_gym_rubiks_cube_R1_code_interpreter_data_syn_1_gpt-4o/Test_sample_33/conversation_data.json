    "To solve a Rubik's Cube, we need to follow a series of steps that involve manipulating the cube's faces using specific moves. The Singmaster notation is a standard way to describe these moves. The notation includes:\n\n- U (Up): Rotate the top face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- D (Down): Rotate the bottom face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- L (Left): Rotate the left face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- R (Right): Rotate the right face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- F (Front): Rotate the front face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- B (Back): Rotate the back face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- A move followed by an apostrophe (e.g., U') indicates a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation.\n- A move followed by '2' (e.g., U2) indicates a 180-degree rotation.\n\nGiven the complexity of solving a Rubik's Cube, the solution involves multiple steps, including solving the cross, corners, middle layer, and final layer. However, since the request is to provide a solution without combining steps, we will break down each move individually.\n\nTo generate a solution, we can use a Rubik's Cube solving algorithm or a library that can compute the solution based on the current state of the cube. Let's use a Python script to find the solution using a library that can handle this task.\n\n```python\nfrom rubik_solver import utils\n\n# Define the current state of the cube using the color notation\n# The cube is represented as a string of 54 characters, each representing a color\n# The order is: U (Up), R (Right), F (Front), D (Down), L (Left), B (Back)\n# Colors: W (White), Y (Yellow), R (Red), O (Orange), G (Green), B (Blue)\n\ncube_state = (\n    \"GWW\"\n    \"OYO\"\n    \"GOO\"\n    \"YBYRGGW\"\n    \"WGRRO\"\n    \"YR\"\n    \"YRGBWO\"\n    \"RBB\"\n    \"O\"\n    \"BYRBGO\"\n    \"YGBR\"\n    \"YO\"\n    \"YWB\"\n    \"GWR\"\n    \"WBW\"\n)\n\n# Solve the cube using the library\nsolution = utils.solve(cube_state, 'Kociemba')\n\n# Print the solution in Singmaster notation\nprint(' '.join(solution))\n```\n\nThis script uses the `rubik_solver` library to compute the solution for the given cube state. The solution will be printed in Singmaster notation, with each move separated by a space. The library uses the Kociemba algorithm, which is efficient for solving the cube.\n\nOnce the code is executed, the solution will be provided in the required format.",
    "The error indicates that the `rubik_solver` library is not available in the current environment. To solve the Rubik's Cube without relying on external libraries, we can use a different approach. \n\nSince solving a Rubik's Cube manually involves a series of algorithmic steps, I will provide a general solution outline based on common solving methods. However, without a specific library or tool to compute the exact sequence of moves, the solution will be a general guide rather than a precise sequence.\n\nThe typical steps to solve a Rubik's Cube are:\n\n1. Solve the white cross on the top face.\n2. Solve the white corners to complete the first layer.\n3. Solve the middle layer edges.\n4. Solve the yellow cross on the top face.\n5. Position the yellow corners correctly.\n6. Orient the yellow corners to complete the cube.\n\nGiven the complexity of manually computing each move without a solver, I will provide a general solution outline. For a precise solution, a Rubik's Cube solver tool or algorithm is typically used.\n\nHere's a general outline of the solution:\n\n1. **White Cross:**\n   - Align the white edge pieces with the center pieces of the adjacent sides.\n\n2. **White Corners:**\n   - Position the white corner pieces in their correct locations.\n\n3. **Middle Layer:**\n   - Use algorithms to position the edge pieces in the middle layer.\n\n4. **Yellow Cross:**\n   - Form a yellow cross on the top face.\n\n5. **Position Yellow Corners:**\n   - Use algorithms to position the yellow corners correctly.\n\n6. **Orient Yellow Corners:**\n   - Use algorithms to orient the yellow corners to complete the cube.\n\nSince I cannot provide a precise sequence of moves without a solver, I recommend using an online Rubik's Cube solver tool where you can input the current state of your cube to get the exact sequence of moves in Singmaster notation.\n\nIf you have access to a Rubik's Cube solver tool or library, you can input the cube's state to get the exact solution. Otherwise, following the general outline above with known algorithms for each step can help solve the cube manually."
