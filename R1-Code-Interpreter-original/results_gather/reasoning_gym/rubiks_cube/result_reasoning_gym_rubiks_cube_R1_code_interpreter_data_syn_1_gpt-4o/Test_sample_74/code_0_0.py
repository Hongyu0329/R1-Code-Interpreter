# This is a placeholder for the code that would generate the solution.
# In practice, solving a Rubik's Cube programmatically involves complex algorithms
# such as Kociemba's algorithm or Thistlethwaite's algorithm.
# Here, we will simulate a simple step-by-step solution using Singmaster notation.

# Define a function to simulate solving the Rubik's Cube
def solve_rubiks_cube():
    # Step 1: Solve the white cross
    white_cross = "F R U R' U' F' "  # Example moves for white cross

    # Step 2: Solve the white corners
    white_corners = "U R U' L' U R' U' L "  # Example moves for white corners

    # Step 3: Solve the middle layer edges
    middle_layer = "U R U' R' U' F' U F "  # Example moves for middle layer

    # Step 4: Solve the yellow cross
    yellow_cross = "F R U R' U' F' "  # Example moves for yellow cross

    # Step 5: Solve the yellow corners
    yellow_corners = "R U R' U R U2 R' "  # Example moves for yellow corners

    # Step 6: Position the yellow corners
    position_yellow_corners = "U R U' L' U R' U' L "  # Example moves for positioning

    # Step 7: Position the yellow edges
    position_yellow_edges = "R U R' U R U2 R' U "  # Example moves for positioning

    # Combine all steps
    solution = white_cross + white_corners + middle_layer + yellow_cross + yellow_corners + position_yellow_corners + position_yellow_edges
    return solution

# Print the solution
print(solve_rubiks_cube())
