    "To solve a Rubik's Cube, we need to follow a series of steps that involve manipulating the cube's faces using specific notations. The Singmaster notation is a standard way to describe these moves, where each letter represents a face of the cube:\n\n- U (Up)\n- D (Down)\n- L (Left)\n- R (Right)\n- F (Front)\n- B (Back)\n\nEach letter by itself means a 90-degree clockwise rotation of that face. A letter followed by an apostrophe (e.g., U') means a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation. A letter followed by a 2 (e.g., U2) means a 180-degree rotation, but as per the instructions, we will write it as two separate moves (e.g., U U).\n\nGiven the complexity of solving a Rubik's Cube, especially from a random configuration, it is typically done using a series of algorithms that solve the cube layer by layer. The most common method is the CFOP method (Cross, F2L, OLL, PLL).\n\nHowever, manually deriving a solution from a specific configuration without a Rubik's Cube solver algorithm is quite complex and error-prone. Therefore, I will use a Python script to simulate a Rubik's Cube solver that can provide the solution in Singmaster notation.\n\nLet's proceed with the code to solve the cube:\n\n```python\n# Importing a Rubik's Cube solver library\nfrom rubik_solver import utils\n\n# Define the cube configuration\n# The cube is represented in a string format where each face is a single string\n# The order is: U, R, F, D, L, B\n# Each face is represented by 9 characters (3x3), and the whole cube is a single string of 54 characters\ncube_configuration = (\n    \"YOR\"  # U face\n    \"WYG\"\n    \"RRG\"\n    \"GRB\"  # R face\n    \"WGO\"\n    \"YYW\"\n    \"GYR\"  # F face\n    \"WRY\"\n    \"BGW\"\n    \"OOB\"  # D face\n    \"YWB\"\n    \"OOO\"\n    \"WRY\"  # L face\n    \"BGO\"\n    \"OOW\"\n    \"GYR\"  # B face\n    \"BGB\"\n    \"WRY\"\n)\n\n# Solve the cube\nsolution = utils.solve(cube_configuration, 'Kociemba')\n\n# Convert the solution to the required format\nformatted_solution = ' '.join(solution).replace('2', ' ').replace(\"'\", \"' \")\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(formatted_solution)\n```\n\nThis script uses a Rubik's Cube solver library to find the solution for the given configuration. The solution is then formatted to match the requirement of not combining any steps. The output will be the sequence of moves in Singmaster notation.",
    "It seems that the `rubik_solver` library is not available in the current environment. This library is typically used to solve Rubik's Cube configurations programmatically. Since we cannot use this library, we need to approach the problem differently.\n\nGiven the complexity of solving a Rubik's Cube manually from a specific configuration, it is usually done using a series of algorithms that solve the cube layer by layer. However, without a solver library, providing an exact solution for a specific configuration is not feasible in this environment.\n\nInstead, I can guide you through the general steps of solving a Rubik's Cube using the CFOP method:\n\n1. **Cross**: Solve the white cross on the top face.\n2. **F2L (First Two Layers)**: Solve the first two layers.\n3. **OLL (Orientation of the Last Layer)**: Orient the last layer so that all the top face pieces are the same color.\n4. **PLL (Permutation of the Last Layer)**: Permute the last layer pieces to solve the cube.\n\nEach of these steps involves specific algorithms that are applied based on the cube's current state. Unfortunately, without a solver library, I cannot provide the exact sequence of moves for your specific configuration.\n\nIf you have access to a Rubik's Cube solver tool or application, you can input the configuration there to get the solution. Alternatively, you can manually solve the cube using the CFOP method and the associated algorithms.\n\nIf you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!"
