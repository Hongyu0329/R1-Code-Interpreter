    "To solve a Rubik's Cube, we typically follow a series of steps that involve solving the cube layer by layer. The Singmaster notation is used to describe the moves on the cube, where each face of the cube is denoted by a letter: U (Up), D (Down), L (Left), R (Right), F (Front), and B (Back). A move is a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the face, and a counterclockwise rotation is denoted by an apostrophe (e.g., U').\n\nGiven the complexity of solving a Rubik's Cube, especially from a specific scrambled state, it is often more efficient to use a computer algorithm to determine the sequence of moves needed to solve the cube. There are several algorithms available, such as the CFOP method, which is commonly used by speedcubers.\n\nTo solve the cube from the given scrambled state, I will use a Python script that utilizes a Rubik's Cube solving library. This script will take the scrambled state as input and output the sequence of moves in Singmaster notation.\n\n```python\nfrom rubik_solver import utils\n\n# Define the scrambled state of the cube\nscrambled_state = [\n    'R', 'R', 'W',\n    'Y', 'Y', 'Y',\n    'W', 'W', 'W',\n    'Y', 'B', 'G', 'R', 'R', 'R', 'B', 'G', 'B', 'O', 'G', 'G',\n    'W', 'R', 'R', 'B', 'G', 'Y', 'O', 'O', 'B', 'O', 'B', 'B',\n    'G', 'R', 'R', 'B', 'G', 'Y', 'O', 'O', 'B', 'O', 'W', 'W',\n    'Y', 'W', 'G',\n    'Y', 'W', 'G',\n    'O', 'O', 'Y'\n]\n\n# Solve the cube\nsolution = utils.solve(scrambled_state, 'Kociemba')\n\n# Convert the solution to a string with each move separated by a space\nsolution_str = ' '.join(solution)\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(solution_str)\n```\n\nThis script uses the `rubik_solver` library, which implements the Kociemba algorithm to find an optimal solution for the Rubik's Cube. The scrambled state is provided as a list of colors, and the solution is returned as a list of moves in Singmaster notation. The solution is then printed as a string with each move separated by a space.\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the sequence of moves needed to solve the cube.",
    "The error indicates that the `rubik_solver` library is not installed in the current environment. Since I cannot directly install packages or run code that requires external libraries in this environment, I will provide an alternative approach.\n\nTo solve the Rubik's Cube, we can use a well-known algorithm like the CFOP method, which involves solving the cube layer by layer. However, manually deriving the solution from a specific scrambled state is complex and typically requires a solver.\n\nInstead, I will provide a general outline of the steps involved in solving a Rubik's Cube using the CFOP method, which you can follow or implement using a Rubik's Cube solver tool:\n\n1. **Cross**: Solve the white cross on the top face.\n2. **F2L (First Two Layers)**: Solve the first two layers by inserting corner-edge pairs.\n3. **OLL (Orientation of the Last Layer)**: Orient all the pieces on the last layer to make the top face a single color.\n4. **PLL (Permutation of the Last Layer)**: Permute the pieces on the last layer to solve the cube.\n\nFor a specific solution in Singmaster notation, you would typically use a Rubik's Cube solver tool or software that can take the scrambled state as input and output the solution steps.\n\nIf you have access to a Rubik's Cube solver tool, you can input the scrambled state and obtain the solution in Singmaster notation. Alternatively, you can install the `rubik_solver` library in your local Python environment and run the provided script to get the solution.\n\nIf you need further assistance with installing the library or using a specific tool, please let me know!"
