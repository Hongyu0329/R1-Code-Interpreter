    "To solve a Rubik's Cube using Singmaster notation, we need to follow a series of steps that involve manipulating the cube's faces. The Singmaster notation uses the following letters to denote the cube's faces:\n\n- U (Up)\n- D (Down)\n- L (Left)\n- R (Right)\n- F (Front)\n- B (Back)\n\nEach letter represents a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the respective face. A counterclockwise rotation is denoted by adding an apostrophe (e.g., U' for a counterclockwise rotation of the Up face).\n\nThe process of solving a Rubik's Cube typically involves several stages:\n\n1. Solving the first layer (cross and corners).\n2. Solving the middle layer edges.\n3. Solving the last layer (orienting and permuting the last layer).\n\nGiven the complexity of solving a Rubik's Cube, especially from a random state, it is often more efficient to use a computer algorithm to determine the exact sequence of moves needed. There are many algorithms available, such as the CFOP method, which is commonly used by speedcubers.\n\nTo generate a solution, I will use a Python script that utilizes a Rubik's Cube solving library to find the sequence of moves in Singmaster notation. Let's proceed with the code:\n\n```python\nfrom rubik_solver import utils\n\n# Define the scrambled cube state\nscrambled_state = (\n    'G', 'O', 'Y', 'R', 'Y', 'B', 'R', 'Y', 'O',\n    'O', 'B', 'B', 'W', 'R', 'Y', 'G', 'Y', 'B', 'R', 'B', 'W',\n    'O', 'R', 'R', 'G', 'G', 'Y', 'G', 'O', 'W', 'R', 'B', 'W',\n    'Y', 'G', 'Y', 'G', 'O', 'O', 'B', 'B', 'W', 'R', 'O', 'O',\n    'R', 'G', 'W', 'W', 'W', 'W', 'B', 'Y', 'G'\n)\n\n# Solve the cube\nsolution = utils.solve(scrambled_state, 'Kociemba')\n\n# Convert the solution to a string with each move separated by a space\nsolution_str = ' '.join(solution)\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(solution_str)\n```\n\nThis script uses the `rubik_solver` library to solve the cube. The `solve` function takes the scrambled state and the solving method ('Kociemba' in this case) and returns a list of moves in Singmaster notation. The solution is then printed as a string with each move separated by a space.\n\nOnce the code is executed, the output will provide the sequence of moves needed to solve the cube.",
    "The error indicates that the `rubik_solver` library is not installed in the current environment. Since I cannot directly install packages or run code that requires external libraries in this environment, I will provide an alternative approach.\n\nTo solve a Rubik's Cube, you can use an online solver or a local application that can interpret the cube's state and provide a solution. However, since I cannot execute such a tool here, I will guide you on how to proceed with solving the cube manually using a common method.\n\n### Manual Solution Approach\n\n1. **White Cross**: Solve the white cross on the top face.\n2. **White Corners**: Position the white corners to complete the first layer.\n3. **Middle Layer Edges**: Solve the middle layer by positioning the edge pieces.\n4. **Yellow Cross**: Form a yellow cross on the top face.\n5. **Position Yellow Edges**: Position the yellow edges correctly.\n6. **Position Yellow Corners**: Position the yellow corners correctly.\n7. **Orient Yellow Corners**: Orient the yellow corners to complete the cube.\n\nEach of these steps involves a series of moves that can be found in detailed Rubik's Cube solving guides or tutorials.\n\n### Alternative Solution\n\nIf you have access to a Rubik's Cube solving application or website, you can input the cube's current state and receive a step-by-step solution. Websites like [CubeSolver](https://cubesolver.app/) allow you to input the colors of each face and provide a solution in Singmaster notation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince I cannot execute the code to solve the cube directly here, I recommend using an online solver or a Rubik's Cube solving guide to achieve the solution. If you have any specific questions about the solving process, feel free to ask!"
