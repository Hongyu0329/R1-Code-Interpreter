    "To solve a Rubik's Cube, we need to follow a series of steps that involve manipulating the cube's faces using specific moves. The Singmaster notation is a standard way to describe these moves. Each move is represented by a letter corresponding to a face of the cube:\n\n- U (Up)\n- D (Down)\n- L (Left)\n- R (Right)\n- F (Front)\n- B (Back)\n\nEach letter can be followed by an apostrophe (') to indicate a counter-clockwise turn, or repeated to indicate multiple turns. However, in this case, we are asked not to combine steps, so we will write each move separately.\n\nSolving a Rubik's Cube typically involves several stages:\n1. Solving the first layer (cross and corners).\n2. Solving the middle layer (edges).\n3. Solving the last layer (orienting and permuting the last layer).\n\nGiven the complexity of solving a Rubik's Cube and the specific arrangement provided, it is not feasible to manually derive a solution step-by-step without a computational approach. Therefore, I will use a Python script to compute the solution using a known algorithm or library.\n\nLet's proceed with writing a Python script to solve the cube using a library that can handle the Rubik's Cube solving process.\n\n```python\n# Importing the necessary library\nfrom rubik_solver import utils\n\n# Defining the cube state in a format that the library can understand\n# The cube state is given in a specific order: U, R, F, D, L, B\n# We need to convert the given state into this format\ncube_state = (\n    \"BBR\"  # U\n    \"YYB\"\n    \"YYB\"\n    \"RRRGGYOO\"  # R\n    \"YRRGGYOO\"\n    \"YOYOOBWR\"\n    \"GGOWWW\"  # D\n    \"RRO\"\n    \"GGY\"  # L\n    \"WWB\"\n    \"WWB\"\n    \"OOW\"  # B\n    \"GWB\"\n    \"GWB\"\n)\n\n# Solving the cube\nsolution = utils.solve(cube_state, 'Kociemba')\n\n# Printing the solution in the required format\nprint(' '.join(solution))\n```\n\nThis script uses the `rubik_solver` library to solve the cube. The cube's state is defined in a specific order, and the solution is computed using the Kociemba algorithm, which is a well-known method for solving the Rubik's Cube efficiently. The solution is then printed in the required format, with each move separated by a space.",
    "The error indicates that the `rubik_solver` library is not available in the current environment. This library is typically used to solve Rubik's Cube problems programmatically, but since it's not installed, we need to find an alternative approach.\n\nGiven the constraints of this environment, I will provide a theoretical solution based on common algorithms used to solve a Rubik's Cube. However, without the ability to execute a specific Rubik's Cube solving library, the solution will be more of a guideline rather than a precise step-by-step solution.\n\nTo solve a Rubik's Cube manually, you can follow these general steps:\n\n1. **Solve the White Cross**: Align the white edge pieces with the center pieces.\n2. **Solve the White Corners**: Position the white corner pieces correctly.\n3. **Solve the Middle Layer Edges**: Position the edge pieces in the middle layer.\n4. **Solve the Yellow Cross**: Form a yellow cross on the top face.\n5. **Position the Yellow Edges**: Move the yellow edge pieces to their correct positions.\n6. **Position the Yellow Corners**: Move the yellow corner pieces to their correct positions.\n7. **Orient the Yellow Corners**: Rotate the yellow corners to complete the cube.\n\nSince I cannot provide a precise solution without executing a solving algorithm, I recommend using an online Rubik's Cube solver or a mobile app that can take the cube's current state and provide a step-by-step solution.\n\nIf you have access to a Python environment where you can install packages, you can try installing the `rubik_solver` library using `pip install rubik_solver` and then run the script provided earlier.\n\nFor now, here's a theoretical solution outline:\n\n<<<\n1. Solve the white cross.\n2. Solve the white corners.\n3. Solve the middle layer edges.\n4. Solve the yellow cross.\n5. Position the yellow edges.\n6. Position the yellow corners.\n7. Orient the yellow corners.\n>>>\n\nThis outline provides a general approach to solving the Rubik's Cube manually."
