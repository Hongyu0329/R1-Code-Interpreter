    "To solve a 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube, we need to follow a series of steps that will systematically bring the cube to its solved state. The solution involves several stages, each focusing on a specific part of the cube. The Singmaster notation will be used to describe the moves, where:\n\n- U = Up face\n- D = Down face\n- L = Left face\n- R = Right face\n- F = Front face\n- B = Back face\n- A single letter means a 90-degree clockwise rotation of that face.\n- A letter followed by an apostrophe (e.g., U') means a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation.\n- A letter followed by '2' (e.g., U2) means a 180-degree rotation, but as per the request, we will write it as two separate moves (e.g., U U).\n\nThe solution involves the following steps:\n\n1. Solve the white cross.\n2. Solve the white corners.\n3. Solve the middle layer edges.\n4. Solve the yellow cross.\n5. Position the yellow edges.\n6. Position the yellow corners.\n7. Orient the yellow corners.\n\nGiven the complexity of solving a Rubik's Cube, especially from a specific scrambled state, it is often more efficient to use a computer algorithm to determine the exact sequence of moves. Let's write a Python script to simulate this process and find the solution.\n\n```python\n# Importing a Rubik's Cube solver library\nfrom rubik_solver import utils\n\n# Define the scrambled state of the cube\nscrambled_state = (\n    'YYOYYWGG',  # Up face\n    'RRWOOYYG',  # Left face\n    'WRRGGWOO',  # Front face\n    'YRGBBWOB',  # Right face\n    'WBRWGYBR',  # Back face\n    'BWOOWOYR'   # Down face\n)\n\n# Solve the cube\nsolution = utils.solve(scrambled_state, 'Kociemba')\n\n# Convert the solution to the required format\nformatted_solution = ' '.join(solution).replace('2', ' ').replace('\\'', ' \\'').replace('  ', ' ')\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(formatted_solution)\n```\n\nThis script uses a library to solve the Rubik's Cube and formats the solution according to the requirements. Let's execute this code to get the solution.",
    "It seems that the `rubik_solver` library is not available in the current environment. This library is typically used to solve Rubik's Cube problems programmatically. Since we cannot use this library, we need to approach the problem differently.\n\nGiven the complexity of solving a Rubik's Cube manually from a specific scrambled state, and without the ability to use a specialized library, the task becomes quite challenging. However, I can provide a general solution sequence for solving a Rubik's Cube, which you can apply to your specific scrambled state.\n\nHere is a step-by-step guide using Singmaster notation:\n\n1. **Solve the White Cross:**\n   - Align the white edge pieces with the center pieces on the adjacent sides.\n\n2. **Solve the White Corners:**\n   - Position the white corner pieces in their correct places.\n\n3. **Solve the Middle Layer Edges:**\n   - Move the edge pieces of the middle layer to their correct positions.\n\n4. **Solve the Yellow Cross:**\n   - Form a yellow cross on the top face.\n\n5. **Position the Yellow Edges:**\n   - Move the yellow edge pieces to their correct positions.\n\n6. **Position the Yellow Corners:**\n   - Move the yellow corner pieces to their correct positions.\n\n7. **Orient the Yellow Corners:**\n   - Rotate the yellow corner pieces to complete the cube.\n\nSince I cannot provide a specific solution for the given scrambled state without a solver, I recommend using an online Rubik's Cube solver where you can input the scrambled state and get a step-by-step solution.\n\nIf you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!"
