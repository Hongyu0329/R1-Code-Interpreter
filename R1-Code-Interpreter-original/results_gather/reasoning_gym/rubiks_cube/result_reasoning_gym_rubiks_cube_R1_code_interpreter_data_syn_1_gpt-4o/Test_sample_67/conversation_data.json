    "To solve a Rubik's Cube, we typically follow a series of steps that involve solving the cube layer by layer. The Singmaster notation is used to describe the moves on the cube, where:\n\n- U = Up face\n- D = Down face\n- L = Left face\n- R = Right face\n- F = Front face\n- B = Back face\n- Each move can be followed by an apostrophe (') to indicate a counter-clockwise turn, or repeated to indicate multiple turns.\n\nGiven the complexity of solving a Rubik's Cube, especially from a specific scrambled state, it is often more efficient to use a computer algorithm to determine the exact sequence of moves needed to solve the cube. \n\nLet's write a Python script to simulate solving the Rubik's Cube using a known algorithm. We'll use a library that can handle the cube's state and provide a solution in Singmaster notation.\n\n```python\n# Importing a library to solve the Rubik's Cube\nfrom rubik_solver import utils\n\n# Define the scrambled state of the cube\n# The state is represented as a string of 54 characters, each representing a color\n# The order is: UUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRFFFFFFFFFDDDDDDDDDLLLLLLLLLBBBBBBBBB\n# Using the given scrambled state:\nscrambled_state = (\n    \"BOYYYGGRB\"  # U face\n    \"YGOWGORYOR\"  # R face\n    \"YRYBGOYOBR\"  # F face\n    \"GGBRWWGWOY\"  # D face\n    \"WOOOWWBBBR\"  # L face\n    \"GRBRWWBBBR\"  # B face\n)\n\n# Solve the cube\nsolution = utils.solve(scrambled_state, 'Kociemba')\n\n# Print the solution in Singmaster notation\nprint(' '.join(solution))\n```\n\nThis script uses the `rubik_solver` library to solve the cube. The `solve` function takes the scrambled state and returns a list of moves in Singmaster notation. The solution is then printed as a space-separated string of moves.\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the sequence of moves needed to solve the cube. Let's execute the code to get the solution.",
    "It seems that the `rubik_solver` library is not available in the current environment. This library is typically used to solve Rubik's Cube problems programmatically, but if it's not installed, we need to consider an alternative approach.\n\nSince we cannot use the library, I'll provide a general solution approach for solving a Rubik's Cube using the layer-by-layer method. This method involves solving the cube in several stages:\n\n1. Solve the first layer (cross and corners).\n2. Solve the middle layer (edges).\n3. Solve the last layer (cross, corners, and final positioning).\n\nHowever, providing a step-by-step solution for a specific scrambled state without a solver library is complex and typically requires a solver algorithm or tool.\n\nGiven the constraints, I'll provide a general sequence of moves that are commonly used in solving a Rubik's Cube. This won't solve the specific scrambled state you provided but will give you an idea of the steps involved.\n\n### General Steps to Solve a Rubik's Cube:\n\n1. **First Layer Cross:**\n   - Create a cross on the top face with matching edge colors.\n\n2. **First Layer Corners:**\n   - Insert the corners into their correct positions.\n\n3. **Second Layer Edges:**\n   - Position the edges in the middle layer.\n\n4. **Last Layer Cross:**\n   - Form a cross on the last layer.\n\n5. **Last Layer Corners:**\n   - Position the corners correctly.\n\n6. **Final Positioning:**\n   - Rotate the corners and edges to complete the cube.\n\n### Example Moves (General):\n\n- **Cross:** F R U R' U' F'\n- **Corners:** U R U' L' U R' U' L\n- **Middle Layer:** U R U' R' U' F' U F\n- **Last Layer Cross:** F R U R' U' F'\n- **Position Corners:** U R U' L' U R' U' L\n- **Final Positioning:** R U R' U R U2 R'\n\nThese are general moves and may not directly solve the specific scrambled state you provided. For an exact solution, using a Rubik's Cube solver tool or algorithm is recommended.\n\nIf you have access to a Rubik's Cube solver tool, you can input the scrambled state and get the exact sequence of moves needed to solve it.\n\n<<<Without a specific solver tool or library available, providing an exact solution for the given scrambled state is not feasible. However, the general steps and moves provided can guide you in solving a Rubik's Cube using the layer-by-layer method.>>>"
