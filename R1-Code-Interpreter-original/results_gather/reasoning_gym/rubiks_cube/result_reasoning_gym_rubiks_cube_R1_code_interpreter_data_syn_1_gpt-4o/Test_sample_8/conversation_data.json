    "To solve a 3x3x3 Rubik's cube, we can use a standard method such as the CFOP method (Cross, F2L, OLL, PLL). However, solving a Rubik's cube from a given state requires a detailed analysis of the current configuration and then applying a series of moves to reach the solved state.\n\nGiven the complexity of solving a Rubik's cube from a specific configuration, it is often more efficient to use a Rubik's cube solver algorithm or software that can compute the solution steps. These algorithms typically use a breadth-first search or other optimization techniques to find the shortest path to the solved state.\n\nTo solve the cube using a programmatic approach, we can use a Python library such as `kociemba`, which implements the two-phase algorithm to solve a Rubik's cube. This library can take the current state of the cube as input and return the solution in Singmaster notation.\n\nLet's write a Python script to solve the cube using the `kociemba` library. First, we need to represent the cube's current state in a format that the library can understand. The cube's state is typically represented as a string of 54 characters, each representing a sticker on the cube.\n\nHere's how we can proceed:\n\n1. Convert the given cube state into a string representation.\n2. Use the `kociemba` library to find the solution.\n3. Print the solution in Singmaster notation.\n\n```python\n# Import the kociemba library\nimport kociemba\n\n# Define the current state of the cube\n# The cube state is represented as a string of 54 characters\n# Each character represents a sticker on the cube\n# The order is: U (up), R (right), F (front), D (down), L (left), B (back)\ncube_state = (\n    \"YRRRYWGGR\"\n    \"BWRWGBWOYBYO\"\n    \"ORYOGBWOWGBG\"\n    \"GGO\"\n    \"BWR\"\n    \"WOG\"\n)\n\n# Use the kociemba library to find the solution\nsolution = kociemba.solve(cube_state)\n\n# Print the solution in Singmaster notation\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis script will output the solution in Singmaster notation, which can then be formatted to avoid combining steps like 'U2' into 'U U'. \n\nLet's execute the code to get the solution.",
    "It seems that the `kociemba` library is not available in the current environment. Since we cannot use this library directly, we need to find an alternative way to solve the Rubik's cube.\n\nOne approach is to manually determine the solution using known algorithms and sequences for solving a Rubik's cube. However, this process is complex and requires a deep understanding of the cube's mechanics and solving techniques.\n\nGiven the constraints, I will provide a general outline of the steps involved in solving a Rubik's cube using the CFOP method:\n\n1. **Cross**: Solve the cross on the first layer.\n2. **F2L (First Two Layers)**: Solve the first two layers simultaneously.\n3. **OLL (Orientation of the Last Layer)**: Orient all the pieces on the last layer so that the top face is a single color.\n4. **PLL (Permutation of the Last Layer)**: Permute the pieces on the last layer to complete the cube.\n\nSince I cannot execute a program to find the exact solution, I will provide a generic sequence of moves that can be used to solve a Rubik's cube from a scrambled state. This sequence will not be specific to the given configuration but will illustrate the process.\n\n```plaintext\n1. Cross: F R U R' U' F'\n2. F2L: U R U' R' U' F' U F\n3. OLL: F R U R' U' F'\n4. PLL: R U R' U R U2 R'\n```\n\nThese sequences are examples of algorithms used in the CFOP method. To solve the specific cube configuration provided, you would need to apply these algorithms in the correct order and orientation based on the cube's current state.\n\nIf you have access to a Rubik's cube solver tool or software, you can input the cube's state to get the exact solution in Singmaster notation.\n\n<<<The solution to the specific Rubik's cube configuration requires a solver tool or software to compute the exact sequence of moves. The provided sequences are examples of algorithms used in the CFOP method.>>>"
