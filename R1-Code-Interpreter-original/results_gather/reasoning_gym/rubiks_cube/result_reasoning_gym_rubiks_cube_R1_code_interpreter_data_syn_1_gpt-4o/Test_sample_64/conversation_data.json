    "To solve a Rubik's Cube using Singmaster notation, we need to follow a series of steps that involve solving the cube layer by layer. The Singmaster notation uses the following moves:\n\n- U (Up)\n- D (Down)\n- L (Left)\n- R (Right)\n- F (Front)\n- B (Back)\n\nEach move can be clockwise or counterclockwise (denoted by an apostrophe, e.g., U').\n\nThe process to solve a Rubik's Cube typically involves:\n\n1. Solving the first layer (cross and corners).\n2. Solving the middle layer (edges).\n3. Solving the last layer (cross, corners, and final positioning).\n\nGiven the complexity of solving a Rubik's Cube, especially from a random state, it is often more efficient to use a computer algorithm to determine the exact sequence of moves. There are several algorithms available, such as the CFOP method, which can be implemented in Python to find the solution.\n\nLet's write a Python script to solve the Rubik's Cube using a known algorithm. We'll use a library that can handle the cube's state and provide the solution in Singmaster notation.\n\n```python\n# Importing a library to solve the Rubik's Cube\nfrom kociemba import solve\n\n# Define the cube state in a string format\n# The cube state is represented as a string of 54 characters, each representing a color\n# The order is: U (Up), R (Right), F (Front), D (Down), L (Left), B (Back)\n# Colors: W (White), R (Red), B (Blue), O (Orange), G (Green), Y (Yellow)\n\ncube_state = (\n    \"GYBGYYGOG\"\n    \"YRRWGRGOW\"\n    \"RRRWGWBOW\"\n    \"BGGOYOBOR\"\n    \"WGW\"\n    \"WWBOBB\"\n)\n\n# Solve the cube using the kociemba library\nsolution = solve(cube_state)\n\n# Print the solution in Singmaster notation\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis script uses the `kociemba` library, which implements the Kociemba two-phase algorithm to solve the Rubik's Cube. The cube state is represented as a string, and the solution is provided in Singmaster notation. The output will be a sequence of moves that solve the cube from the given state.\n\nLet's execute the code to get the solution.",
    "It seems that the `kociemba` library is not available in the current environment. This library is specifically designed to solve Rubik's Cube problems using the Kociemba algorithm. Since we cannot use this library directly, we need to approach the problem differently.\n\nGiven the complexity of solving a Rubik's Cube manually without a specialized library, I will provide a general solution outline using the CFOP method, which is a common method for solving the cube. However, this will be a theoretical solution rather than a computed one.\n\n### CFOP Method Steps:\n\n1. **Cross on the First Layer:**\n   - Solve the cross on the first layer by aligning the edge pieces with the center pieces.\n\n2. **First Layer Corners:**\n   - Insert the corner pieces of the first layer by positioning them correctly.\n\n3. **Middle Layer Edges:**\n   - Solve the middle layer by inserting the edge pieces into their correct positions.\n\n4. **Last Layer Cross:**\n   - Form a cross on the last layer using specific algorithms.\n\n5. **Position Last Layer Corners:**\n   - Position the corners of the last layer correctly.\n\n6. **Orient Last Layer Corners:**\n   - Use algorithms to orient the corners correctly.\n\n7. **Position Last Layer Edges:**\n   - Finally, position the last layer edges to complete the cube.\n\n### Example Solution in Singmaster Notation:\n\nSince I cannot compute the exact solution without a library, I will provide a hypothetical sequence of moves that might be used in a typical CFOP solution. Note that this is not specific to the given cube state but serves as an example of how a solution might look.\n\n```\nF R U R' U' F' U2 L U L' U L U2 L'\nR U R' U R U2 R' U2\nU R U' L' U R' U' L\nU2 R U2 R' U' R U' R'\n```\n\nThis sequence is a generic example and may not solve the specific cube state you provided. For an exact solution, using a Rubik's Cube solver tool or library is recommended.\n\n<<<The solution to the Rubik's Cube requires a specific sequence of moves that can be computed using specialized algorithms or libraries. Without access to such a library, a theoretical approach using the CFOP method is suggested. For an exact solution, consider using a Rubik's Cube solver tool.>>>"
