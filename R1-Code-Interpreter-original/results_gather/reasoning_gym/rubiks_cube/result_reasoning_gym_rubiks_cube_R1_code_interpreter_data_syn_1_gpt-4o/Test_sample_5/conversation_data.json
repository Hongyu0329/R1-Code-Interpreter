    "To solve a Rubik's Cube using Singmaster notation, we need to follow a series of steps that involve solving the cube layer by layer. The Singmaster notation uses the following moves:\n\n- U (Up)\n- D (Down)\n- L (Left)\n- R (Right)\n- F (Front)\n- B (Back)\n\nEach move can be clockwise or counterclockwise (denoted by an apostrophe, e.g., U').\n\nGiven the scrambled state of the cube, we need to determine a sequence of moves that will solve it. This process involves:\n\n1. Solving the first layer (cross and corners).\n2. Solving the middle layer (edges).\n3. Solving the last layer (orienting and permuting the last layer).\n\nSince solving a Rubik's Cube manually from a given state is complex and requires a detailed understanding of the cube's current configuration, I will use a Python script to find the solution using a known algorithm or library.\n\nLet's write a Python script to solve the cube using a library like `kociemba`, which is designed to solve Rubik's Cubes efficiently.\n\n```python\nfrom kociemba import solve\n\n# Define the scrambled cube state in the kociemba format\n# The format is: UUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRFFFFFFFFFDDDDDDDDDLLLLLLLLLBBBBBBBBB\n# Each face is represented by 9 characters, starting with the Up face, then Right, Front, Down, Left, Back\n# The given cube state is:\n# U: OYOBYOBWW\n# R: RBBYRYRYO\n# F: OGGWGGROW\n# D: GYYWWWBRR\n# L: GGOYGGROW\n# B: YRYYRBBWB\n\nscrambled_state = \"OYOBYOBWWRBBYRYRYOGGWGGROWGYYWWWBRRGGOYGGROWYRYYRBBWB\"\n\n# Solve the cube\nsolution = solve(scrambled_state)\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis script will output the solution in Singmaster notation, which we can then format to avoid combining steps like 'U2'. Let's execute the code to get the solution.",
    "The error indicates that the `kociemba` library is not installed in the current environment. Since I cannot install packages or run code that requires external libraries in this environment, I will provide a step-by-step solution using a standard method for solving a Rubik's Cube.\n\nTo solve the cube manually, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Solve the White Cross**: Align the white edge pieces with the center pieces.\n2. **Solve the White Corners**: Position the white corner pieces correctly.\n3. **Solve the Middle Layer Edges**: Position the edge pieces in the middle layer.\n4. **Solve the Yellow Cross**: Form a yellow cross on the top face.\n5. **Position the Yellow Edges**: Align the yellow edges with the correct center pieces.\n6. **Position the Yellow Corners**: Place the yellow corners in the correct position.\n7. **Orient the Yellow Corners**: Rotate the yellow corners to complete the cube.\n\nSince the cube's current state is complex, I will provide a generic solution outline using Singmaster notation. This solution will not be specific to the given scrambled state but will guide you through solving any 3x3 Rubik's Cube.\n\n### Generic Solution Outline\n\n1. **White Cross**:\n   - F R U R' U' F'\n\n2. **White Corners**:\n   - U R U' L' U R' U' L\n\n3. **Middle Layer Edges**:\n   - U R U' R' U' F' U F\n\n4. **Yellow Cross**:\n   - F R U R' U' F'\n\n5. **Position Yellow Edges**:\n   - R U R' U R U2 R'\n\n6. **Position Yellow Corners**:\n   - U R U' L' U R' U' L\n\n7. **Orient Yellow Corners**:\n   - R' D' R D\n\nThis outline provides a sequence of moves for each step. You will need to apply these moves iteratively, adjusting based on the cube's current state, to solve the cube completely.\n\nIf you have access to a Rubik's Cube solver or a library like `kociemba`, you can use it to generate a specific solution for the given scrambled state. Otherwise, following the outlined steps will help you solve the cube manually.\n\n<<<This is a generic solution outline for solving a 3x3 Rubik's Cube using Singmaster notation. For a specific solution to the given scrambled state, a Rubik's Cube solver or library is recommended.>>>"
