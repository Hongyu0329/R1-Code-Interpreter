    "To solve a 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube, we need to follow a series of steps that will systematically bring the cube to its solved state. The Singmaster notation is used to describe the moves, where each letter represents a face of the cube to be turned:\n\n- U (Up)\n- D (Down)\n- L (Left)\n- R (Right)\n- F (Front)\n- B (Back)\n\nEach move can be clockwise (e.g., U) or counterclockwise (e.g., U').\n\nGiven the scrambled state of the cube, we need to determine a sequence of moves that will solve it. This process involves several stages, such as solving the cross, corners, middle layer, and finally the top layer.\n\nHowever, solving a Rubik's Cube manually from a given state requires a detailed analysis of the current configuration and is typically done using algorithms that are beyond simple manual calculation. Instead, we can use a Rubik's Cube solver algorithm to find the solution.\n\nLet's write a Python script to simulate this process using a known Rubik's Cube solving library. This will help us generate the sequence of moves needed to solve the cube.\n\n```python\n# Importing a Rubik's Cube solver library\nfrom rubik_solver import utils\n\n# Define the scrambled state of the cube\n# The cube is represented in a string format where each face is listed in order:\n# U (Up), R (Right), F (Front), D (Down), L (Left), B (Back)\n# Each face is represented by 9 characters (3x3), and the colors are represented by their initials:\n# W (White), Y (Yellow), G (Green), B (Blue), R (Red), O (Orange)\n\nscrambled_state = (\n    \"WYY\"  # Up face\n    \"GYY\"\n    \"GYY\"\n    \"GYR\"  # Right face\n    \"ROO\"\n    \"BBB\"\n    \"RRO\"  # Front face\n    \"WGG\"\n    \"WGG\"\n    \"WOO\"  # Down face\n    \"BRR\"\n    \"BWW\"\n    \"YWW\"  # Left face\n    \"GRR\"\n    \"GRR\"\n    \"WOO\"  # Back face\n    \"BOO\"\n    \"BBO\"\n)\n\n# Solve the cube\nsolution = utils.solve(scrambled_state, 'Kociemba')\n\n# Print the solution in Singmaster notation\nprint(' '.join(solution))\n```\n\nThis script uses the `rubik_solver` library to find the solution to the given scrambled state of the Rubik's Cube. The `solve` function returns a list of moves in Singmaster notation, which we then print as a space-separated string.\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the sequence of moves needed to solve the cube.",
    "The error indicates that the `rubik_solver` library is not installed in the current environment. Since we cannot install external libraries in this environment, we need to approach the problem differently.\n\nTo solve a Rubik's Cube manually, we typically follow a series of well-known algorithms. However, without the ability to use a solver library, we need to provide a theoretical solution based on common solving methods.\n\nGiven the complexity of solving a Rubik's Cube from a specific scrambled state, providing a step-by-step solution without computational assistance is challenging. However, I can outline the general steps involved in solving a Rubik's Cube:\n\n1. **Solve the White Cross**: Align the white edge pieces with the center pieces on the top face.\n2. **Solve the White Corners**: Position the white corner pieces correctly.\n3. **Solve the Middle Layer Edges**: Position the edge pieces in the middle layer.\n4. **Solve the Yellow Cross**: Form a yellow cross on the top face.\n5. **Position the Yellow Edges**: Align the yellow edge pieces with the correct center pieces.\n6. **Position the Yellow Corners**: Place the yellow corners in the correct position.\n7. **Orient the Yellow Corners**: Rotate the yellow corners to complete the cube.\n\nSince I cannot provide a specific sequence of moves without computational tools, I recommend using an online Rubik's Cube solver or a physical cube-solving guide to find the exact solution for your scrambled state.\n\nIf you have access to a Rubik's Cube solver tool or app, you can input the scrambled state and receive the solution in Singmaster notation.\n\n<<<Unfortunately, without the ability to use external libraries or tools, I cannot provide a specific sequence of moves to solve the cube. I recommend using an online Rubik's Cube solver to input the scrambled state and receive the solution.>>>"
