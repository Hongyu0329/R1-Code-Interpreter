    "To solve a 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube using Singmaster notation, we need to follow a series of steps that systematically solve the cube layer by layer. The Singmaster notation uses the following moves:\n\n- U (Up)\n- D (Down)\n- L (Left)\n- R (Right)\n- F (Front)\n- B (Back)\n\nEach move can be followed by an apostrophe (') to indicate a counter-clockwise turn, or repeated to indicate multiple turns (e.g., U U for a 180-degree turn).\n\nThe process to solve the cube typically involves the following steps:\n\n1. Solve the white cross on the top face.\n2. Solve the white corners on the top face.\n3. Solve the middle layer edges.\n4. Solve the yellow cross on the bottom face.\n5. Position the yellow corners correctly.\n6. Orient the yellow corners.\n7. Position the yellow edges correctly.\n\nGiven the complexity of solving a Rubik's Cube, it is often more efficient to use a computer algorithm to determine the exact sequence of moves needed to solve a specific cube configuration. Let's write a Python script to simulate this process and find the solution.\n\n```python\n# Importing a library to solve the Rubik's Cube\nfrom rubik_solver import utils\n\n# Define the scrambled cube state\n# The cube state is represented as a string of 54 characters, each representing a color\n# The order is: U (Up), R (Right), F (Front), D (Down), L (Left), B (Back)\n# Colors: W (White), R (Red), G (Green), Y (Yellow), O (Orange), B (Blue)\nscrambled_state = (\n    \"BWG\"  # Up face\n    \"RYO\"\n    \"OOR\"\n    \"OBG\"  # Left face\n    \"WWW\"\n    \"YBB\"\n    \"OYY\"  # Front face\n    \"RGY\"\n    \"GOG\"\n    \"WBR\"  # Right face\n    \"RGY\"\n    \"BOY\"\n    \"WBW\"  # Back face\n    \"RGY\"\n    \"BWR\"\n    \"BRR\"  # Down face\n)\n\n# Solve the cube\nsolution = utils.solve(scrambled_state, 'Kociemba')\n\n# Convert the solution to Singmaster notation without combining steps\nsingmaster_solution = ' '.join(move.replace('2', ' ') for move in solution)\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(singmaster_solution)\n```\n\nThis script uses a library to solve the Rubik's Cube and outputs the solution in Singmaster notation without combining any steps. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The error indicates that the `rubik_solver` library is not available in the current environment. This library is typically used to solve Rubik's Cube problems programmatically, but since it's not installed, we need to find an alternative approach.\n\nGiven the constraints, I will provide a general solution outline for solving a Rubik's Cube using Singmaster notation. However, without the ability to execute a specific algorithm, this will be a generic guide rather than a solution tailored to the specific cube configuration provided.\n\n### General Solution Outline\n\n1. **White Cross:**\n   - Form a cross on the white face by aligning the white edge pieces with the center pieces of adjacent faces.\n\n2. **White Corners:**\n   - Position and orient the white corner pieces to complete the first layer.\n\n3. **Middle Layer Edges:**\n   - Move the edge pieces into their correct positions in the middle layer.\n\n4. **Yellow Cross:**\n   - Form a cross on the yellow face.\n\n5. **Position Yellow Corners:**\n   - Position the yellow corner pieces correctly.\n\n6. **Orient Yellow Corners:**\n   - Rotate the yellow corner pieces to match the yellow face.\n\n7. **Position Yellow Edges:**\n   - Move the yellow edge pieces to their correct positions.\n\n### Example Moves in Singmaster Notation\n\n- **White Cross:**\n  - F R U R' U' F'\n\n- **White Corners:**\n  - U R U' L' U R' U' L\n\n- **Middle Layer Edges:**\n  - U R U' R' U' F' U F\n\n- **Yellow Cross:**\n  - F R U R' U' F'\n\n- **Position Yellow Corners:**\n  - U R U' L' U R' U' L\n\n- **Orient Yellow Corners:**\n  - R U R' U R U2 R'\n\n- **Position Yellow Edges:**\n  - U R U' L' U R' U' L\n\nThis outline provides a step-by-step approach to solving a Rubik's Cube. However, for a specific solution to the given configuration, a Rubik's Cube solver tool or algorithm is required.\n\n<<<This is a general guide to solving a Rubik's Cube using Singmaster notation.
