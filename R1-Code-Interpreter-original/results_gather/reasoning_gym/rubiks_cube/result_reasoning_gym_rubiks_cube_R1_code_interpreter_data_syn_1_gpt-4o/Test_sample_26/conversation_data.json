    "To solve a Rubik's Cube, we need to follow a series of steps that involve manipulating the cube's layers to achieve a solved state. The Singmaster notation is used to describe these moves, where each letter represents a face of the cube:\n\n- U (Up)\n- D (Down)\n- L (Left)\n- R (Right)\n- F (Front)\n- B (Back)\n\nEach letter can be followed by an apostrophe (') to indicate a counter-clockwise turn, or repeated to indicate multiple turns in the same direction.\n\nGiven the current state of the cube, we need to determine a sequence of moves that will solve it. This is a complex problem that typically requires either a deep understanding of Rubik's Cube algorithms or the use of a solving algorithm.\n\nTo solve this problem programmatically, we can use a known algorithm or library that can compute the solution for us. One such library is the `kociemba` Python library, which implements the Two-Phase Algorithm to solve a Rubik's Cube.\n\nLet's write a Python script to use this library to find the solution:\n\n```python\n# Import the kociemba library\nimport kociemba\n\n# Define the current state of the cube in the kociemba format\n# The format is a string of 54 characters representing the cube's faces in the order:\n# UUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRFFFFFFFFFDDDDDDDDDLLLLLLLLLBBBBBBBBB\n# Each face is represented by its initial: U, R, F, D, L, B\n# The given cube state needs to be converted to this format\n\n# Current state of the cube\ncube_state = (\n    \"ORYYYYBBB\"  # U face\n    \"BBWRRRYGG\"  # R face\n    \"OWYOWGOBG\"  # F face\n    \"BWGBWGRGW\"  # D face\n    \"WRRYGWOOG\"  # L face\n    \"OOWYBWRRY\"  # B face\n)\n\n# Find the solution using the kociemba library\nsolution = kociemba.solve(cube_state)\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis script will output the solution in Singmaster notation, which we can then format according to the requirement of not combining any steps. Let's execute this code to find the solution.",
    "The error indicates that the `kociemba` library is not installed in the current environment. Since we cannot install new packages in this environment, we need to approach the problem differently.\n\nTo solve a Rubik's Cube without using external libraries, we can manually determine the solution using known algorithms and sequences. However, this is a complex task that typically requires a solver or a deep understanding of Rubik's Cube solving techniques.\n\nGiven the constraints, I will provide a general approach to solving a Rubik's Cube using the beginner's method, which involves several steps:\n\n1. **Solve the White Cross**: Align the white edge pieces with the center pieces.\n2. **Solve the White Corners**: Position the white corner pieces correctly.\n3. **Solve the Middle Layer Edges**: Position the edge pieces in the middle layer.\n4. **Solve the Yellow Cross**: Form a yellow cross on the top face.\n5. **Position the Yellow Edges**: Align the yellow edge pieces with the correct centers.\n6. **Position the Yellow Corners**: Place the yellow corners in the correct position.\n7. **Orient the Yellow Corners**: Rotate the yellow corners to complete the cube.\n\nEach of these steps involves a series of moves that can be described using Singmaster notation. However, without a solver or a detailed analysis of the current cube state, providing an exact sequence of moves is not feasible.\n\nFor a specific solution, I recommend using an online Rubik's Cube solver where you can input the current state of the cube and receive a step-by-step solution.\n\nIf you have access to a Rubik's Cube solver or can use an online tool, you can input the current state and obtain the solution in Singmaster notation. Otherwise, solving the cube manually using the beginner's method or another algorithm is the best approach.\n\nGiven the limitations, I cannot provide an exact solution sequence here. However, I hope this explanation helps you understand the process of solving a Rubik's Cube."
