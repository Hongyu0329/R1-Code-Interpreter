    "To solve a Rubik's Cube, we typically follow a series of steps that involve solving the cube layer by layer. The Singmaster notation is used to describe the moves on the cube, where each face of the cube is denoted by a letter: U (Up), D (Down), L (Left), R (Right), F (Front), and B (Back). A move is a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the face, and a counterclockwise rotation is denoted by an apostrophe (e.g., U').\n\nGiven the complexity of solving a Rubik's Cube, especially from a random configuration, it is often more efficient to use a computer algorithm to determine the sequence of moves needed to solve the cube. There are several algorithms available, such as the CFOP method, which is commonly used by speedcubers.\n\nTo solve the cube, I will use a Python script that implements a basic Rubik's Cube solving algorithm. This script will take the current configuration of the cube as input and output the sequence of moves needed to solve it.\n\n```python\n# Importing a Rubik's Cube solver library\nfrom rubik_solver import utils\n\n# Define the current state of the cube using the color notation\n# The cube is represented as a string of 54 characters, each representing a sticker\n# The order is: UUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRFFFFFFFFFDDDDDDDDDLLLLLLLLLBBBBBBBBB\n# Using the given configuration:\ncube_state = (\n    \"GGBYYOYRO\"\n    \"YRRGWGRYO\"\n    \"YRRGGBBOW\"\n    \"WBYYGWBWR\"\n    \"OBBRRWGWW\"\n    \"OOGWBBRRB\"\n)\n\n# Solve the cube using the library\nsolution = utils.solve(cube_state, 'Kociemba')\n\n# Print the solution in Singmaster notation\nprint(' '.join(solution))\n```\n\nThis script uses a library to solve the Rubik's Cube using the Kociemba algorithm, which is efficient for finding optimal solutions. The output will be a sequence of moves in Singmaster notation, with each move separated by a space. The solution will not combine any steps, as requested.\n\nOnce the code is executed, the solution will be provided.",
    "It seems that the `rubik_solver` library is not available in the current environment. To solve the Rubik's Cube without relying on external libraries, I will provide a step-by-step solution using a common method like CFOP (Cross, F2L, OLL, PLL). This will be a manual process, and I'll provide the solution in Singmaster notation.\n\nGiven the complexity of solving a Rubik's Cube manually from a specific configuration, I will outline a general approach to solving the cube. However, without the ability to execute a solving algorithm directly, the solution will be more of a guideline.\n\n### General Steps to Solve a Rubik's Cube:\n\n1. **Cross**: Solve the white cross on the top face.\n2. **F2L (First Two Layers)**: Solve the first two layers.\n3. **OLL (Orientation of the Last Layer)**: Orient the last layer so all the top face stickers are the same color.\n4. **PLL (Permutation of the Last Layer)**: Permute the last layer to complete the cube.\n\n### Manual Solution in Singmaster Notation:\n\nGiven the complexity of manually solving the cube from a specific configuration, I will provide a generic solution outline. For a specific solution, a detailed analysis of the cube's current state is required, which is typically done using a solving algorithm.\n\nHere's a generic solution outline:\n\n- **Cross**: \n  - F R U R' U' F'\n  - (Repeat similar moves to complete the cross)\n\n- **F2L**:\n  - U R U' R' U' F' U F\n  - (Repeat similar moves to pair and insert edges and corners)\n\n- **OLL**:\n  - F R U R' U' F'\n  - (Repeat similar moves to orient the last layer)\n\n- **PLL**:\n  - R U R' U R U2 R'\n  - (Repeat similar moves to permute the last layer)\n\nSince I cannot provide a specific solution without executing a solving algorithm, I recommend using a Rubik's Cube solver tool or app to input the current configuration and get the exact sequence of moves needed.\n\nIf you have access to a Rubik's Cube solver tool, you can input the configuration and obtain the solution in Singmaster notation. Alternatively, if you have a specific part of the cube you need help with, feel free to ask for more detailed guidance on that step.\n\n<<<The solution requires a specific algorithmic approach, which is best handled by a Rubik's Cube solver tool or app. Please use such a tool to input the current configuration and obtain the exact sequence of moves needed.>>>"
