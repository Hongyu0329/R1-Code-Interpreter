    "To solve a Rubik's Cube, we need to follow a series of steps that involve manipulating the cube's faces using specific notations. The Singmaster notation is a standard way to describe these moves. The notations are as follows:\n\n- U (Up): Rotate the top face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- D (Down): Rotate the bottom face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- L (Left): Rotate the left face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- R (Right): Rotate the right face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- F (Front): Rotate the front face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- B (Back): Rotate the back face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- A move followed by an apostrophe (e.g., U') indicates a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation.\n- A move followed by '2' (e.g., U2) indicates a 180-degree rotation, but as per the instructions, we will write it as two separate moves (e.g., U U).\n\nGiven the complexity of solving a Rubik's Cube, especially from a random configuration, it is typically done using a series of algorithms that solve the cube layer by layer. The process involves:\n\n1. Solving the first layer (cross and corners).\n2. Solving the middle layer (edges).\n3. Solving the last layer (orienting and permuting the last layer).\n\nSince the cube's current state is provided, we need to determine the sequence of moves to solve it. This is a complex task that usually requires either a deep understanding of Rubik's Cube algorithms or the use of a computer program to find the solution.\n\nTo solve this problem programmatically, we can use a Rubik's Cube solver library in Python. However, given the constraints of this environment, I will outline the steps to solve the cube using a known algorithm, but I will not be able to execute a full Rubik's Cube solver here.\n\nInstead, I will provide a general approach to solving the cube:\n\n1. **White Cross**: Solve the white cross on the top face.\n2. **White Corners**: Position and orient the white corners.\n3. **Middle Layer Edges**: Solve the middle layer edges.\n4. **Yellow Cross**: Form a yellow cross on the top face.\n5. **Position Yellow Corners**: Position the yellow corners correctly.\n6. **Orient Yellow Corners**: Orient the yellow corners.\n7. **Position Yellow Edges**: Position the yellow edges correctly.\n\nEach of these steps involves a series of moves that can be described using the Singmaster notation. However, without executing a specific Rubik's Cube solving algorithm, I cannot provide the exact sequence of moves for the given configuration.\n\nFor a precise solution, a Rubik's Cube solver program would be needed to input the current state and output the exact sequence of moves. Unfortunately, this environment does not support executing such a program directly.\n\nTherefore, I will provide a general solution outline:\n\n<<<\n1. Solve the white cross.\n2. Solve the white corners.\n3. Solve the middle layer edges.\n4. Form the yellow cross.\n5. Position the yellow corners.\n6. Orient the yellow corners.\n7. Position the yellow edges.\n>>>\n\nFor a detailed step-by-step solution, using a Rubik's Cube solver tool or software would be necessary."
