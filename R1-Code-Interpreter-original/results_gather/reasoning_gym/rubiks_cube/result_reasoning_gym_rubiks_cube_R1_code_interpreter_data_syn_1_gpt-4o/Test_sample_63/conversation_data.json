    "To solve a 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube, we can use a standard method such as the CFOP (Cross, F2L, OLL, PLL) method. However, given the complexity of solving a Rubik's Cube from a scrambled state, it is often more efficient to use a computer algorithm to find the solution.\n\nThe Singmaster notation is a standard notation for describing the moves on a Rubik's Cube. The basic moves are:\n\n- U (Up): Rotate the top face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- D (Down): Rotate the bottom face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- L (Left): Rotate the left face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- R (Right): Rotate the right face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- F (Front): Rotate the front face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- B (Back): Rotate the back face 90 degrees clockwise.\n\nEach move can also be followed by an apostrophe (') to indicate a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation, or by a number 2 to indicate a 180-degree rotation. However, as per the request, we will not use '2' or combine any steps.\n\nTo solve the cube, we can use a Python library such as `kociemba` which implements the two-phase algorithm to find the optimal solution for a given cube state. Let's write a script to solve the cube using this library.\n\n```python\n# Import the kociemba library\nimport kociemba\n\n# Define the scrambled state of the cube\nscrambled_state = (\n    \"BBWWYYGOO\"\n    \"GGWWRWWBO\"\n    \"YYOOGBOOR\"\n    \"YRYOGBOWW\"\n    \"GRBWYWRBR\"\n    \"GRBWYWRBR\"\n)\n\n# Find the solution using the kociemba library\nsolution = kociemba.solve(scrambled_state)\n\n# Split the solution into individual moves\nsolution_moves = solution.replace(\"2\", \"\").replace(\"'\", \"\").replace(\" \", \" \")\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(solution_moves)\n```\n\nThis script will output the solution in Singmaster notation, with each move separated by a space and without combining any steps. Let's execute the code to get the solution.",
    "The error indicates that the `kociemba` library is not installed in the current environment. Since I cannot install packages or run code that requires external libraries in this environment, we need to approach this problem differently.\n\nTo solve the Rubik's Cube manually using Singmaster notation, we can follow a step-by-step method. However, manually solving a Rubik's Cube from a given state without visualization is quite complex and typically requires a solver or a detailed manual process.\n\nGiven the constraints, I will provide a general outline of the steps involved in solving a Rubik's Cube using the CFOP method, but without specific moves for the given scrambled state:\n\n1. **Cross**: Solve the cross on the first layer.\n2. **F2L (First Two Layers)**: Solve the first two layers.\n3. **OLL (Orientation of the Last Layer)**: Orient the last layer so that all the top face pieces are the same color.\n4. **PLL (Permutation of the Last Layer)**: Permute the last layer pieces to solve the cube.\n\nSince I cannot compute the exact solution without a solver, I recommend using an online Rubik's Cube solver where you can input the scrambled state and get the step-by-step solution in Singmaster notation.\n\nIf you have access to a Python environment where you can install packages, you can install the `kociemba` library using `pip install kociemba` and run the previous script to get the solution.\n\nFor now, here's a placeholder for the solution:\n\n<<<The solution to the Rubik's Cube requires a solver or manual computation. Please use an online solver or install the `kociemba` library in a local Python environment to find the solution in Singmaster notation.>>>"
