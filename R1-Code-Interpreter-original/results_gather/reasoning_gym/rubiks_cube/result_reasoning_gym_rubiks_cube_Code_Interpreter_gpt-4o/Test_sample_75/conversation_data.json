    "\nassistant > Solving a Rubik's Cube involves a series of algorithmic steps. The solution is typically broken down into several stages, such as solving the cross, corners, middle layer, and finally the top layer. The Singmaster notation is used to describe the moves, where:\n\n- U = Up face\n- D = Down face\n- L = Left face\n- R = Right face\n- F = Front face\n- B = Back face\n- A letter by itself (e.g., U) means a 90-degree clockwise rotation of that face.\n- A letter followed by an apostrophe (e.g., U') means a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation.\n- A letter followed by a 2 (e.g., U2) means a 180-degree rotation.\n\nGiven the complexity of solving a Rubik's Cube, especially from a random configuration, the solution involves a series of steps that are typically executed in sequence. However, without a Rubik's Cube solver algorithm implemented here, I can provide a general solution approach, but not the exact sequence of moves for this specific configuration.\n\nTo solve the cube, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n1. **Solve the White Cross**: Align the white edge pieces with the center pieces.\n2. **Solve the White Corners**: Position and orient the white corner pieces.\n3. **Solve the Middle Layer Edges**: Position the edge pieces in the middle layer.\n4. **Solve the Yellow Cross**: Form a yellow cross on the top face.\n5. **Position the Yellow Corners**: Move the yellow corners to their correct positions.\n6. **Orient the Yellow Corners**: Rotate the yellow corners to match the top face.\n7. **Position the Yellow Edges**: Move the yellow edges to their correct positions.\n\nFor a specific solution, a Rubik's Cube solver algorithm would be required to determine the exact sequence of moves. If you have access to a Rubik's Cube solver tool, you can input the current configuration to get the precise solution."
