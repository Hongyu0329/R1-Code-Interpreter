    "\nassistant > To solve the given 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube, we will use the Singmaster notation, which represents the six faces of the cube as follows:\n\n- U (Up)\n- D (Down)\n- L (Left)\n- R (Right)\n- F (Front)\n- B (Back)\n\nEach move is a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the face unless specified otherwise. A counterclockwise rotation is denoted by an apostrophe (e.g., U').\n\nGiven the complexity of solving a Rubik's Cube, the solution will be broken down into several steps, each consisting of a sequence of moves. The solution will be provided in a step-by-step manner without combining any steps.\n\nHere is the solution to solve the given Rubik's Cube:\n\n<<<\nF F U R U' R' F F L D' L' U U L D L' U U F F R U R' U' F F\n>>> \n\nThis sequence of moves should solve the cube from the given scrambled state."
