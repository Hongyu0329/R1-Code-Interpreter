    "\nassistant > To solve the Rubik's Cube, we will use the Singmaster notation, which represents the six faces of the cube as follows:\n\n- U (Up)\n- D (Down)\n- L (Left)\n- R (Right)\n- F (Front)\n- B (Back)\n\nEach move is a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the face unless specified otherwise. A counterclockwise rotation is denoted by an apostrophe (e.g., U').\n\nGiven the complexity of solving a Rubik's Cube, I will use a step-by-step approach to provide a solution. Let's proceed with solving the cube.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Importing the necessary library to solve the Rubik's Cube\nfrom rubik_solver import utils\n\n# Defining the scrambled state of the Rubik's Cube\n# The cube is represented in the order: U, R, F, D, L, B\nscrambled_state = (\n    'GRGGYGW',  # U (Up)\n    'RRRWWW',  # R (Right)\n    'GOBGOW',  # F (Front)\n    'BBOWOB',  # D (Down)\n    'RRRBBR',  # L (Left)\n    'OOOYYB'   # B (Back)\n)\n\n# Solving the Rubik's Cube\nsolution = utils.solve(scrambled_state, 'Kociemba')\n\n# Converting the solution to a format without combined steps\nexpanded_solution = []\nfor move in solution:\n    if len(move) == 2 and move[1] == '2':\n        expanded_solution.extend([move[0], move[0]])\n    else:\n        expanded_solution.append(move)\n\nexpanded_solution\nassistant > It seems that the necessary library to solve the Rubik's Cube is not available in this environment. However, I can guide you through the process of solving the cube manually using a standard method. \n\nThe solution involves several steps, including solving the cross, corners, middle layer, and finally the top layer. Here is a step-by-step solution using Singmaster notation:\n\n1. **Solve the White Cross:**\n   - Align the white edge pieces with the center pieces.\n\n2. **Solve the White Corners:**\n   - Position the white corner pieces correctly.\n\n3. **Solve the Middle Layer Edges:**\n   - Position the edge pieces of the middle layer.\n\n4. **Solve the Yellow Cross:**\n   - Form a yellow cross on the top face.\n\n5. **Position the Yellow Edges:**\n   - Align the yellow edge pieces with the center pieces.\n\n6. **Position the Yellow Corners:**\n   - Place the yellow corners in the correct position.\n\n7. **Orient the Yellow Corners:**\n   - Rotate the yellow corners to complete the cube.\n\nSince I can't provide a direct solution using a library, I recommend using an online Rubik's Cube solver or a mobile app where you can input the current state of your cube and get a step-by-step solution. If you have any specific questions about the steps, feel free to ask!"
