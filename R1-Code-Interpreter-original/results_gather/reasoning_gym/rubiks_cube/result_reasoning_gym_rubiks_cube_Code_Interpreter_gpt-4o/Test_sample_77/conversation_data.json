    "\nassistant > Solving a Rubik's Cube involves a series of algorithmic steps. The solution can be broken down into several stages, each with its own set of moves. The Singmaster notation is used to describe these moves, where:\n\n- U = Up face\n- D = Down face\n- L = Left face\n- R = Right face\n- F = Front face\n- B = Back face\n- A letter by itself means a 90-degree clockwise rotation of that face.\n- A letter followed by an apostrophe (e.g., U') means a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation.\n- A letter followed by '2' (e.g., U2) means a 180-degree rotation.\n\nGiven the complexity of solving a Rubik's Cube, the solution involves multiple steps, including solving the cross, corners, middle layer, and final layer. However, since you requested not to combine any steps, I will provide a detailed step-by-step solution without combining moves.\n\nLet's proceed with solving the cube.\nassistant > To solve the Rubik's Cube, we will follow the standard layer-by-layer method. This involves solving the cube in several stages:\n\n1. **Solve the White Cross**\n2. **Solve the White Corners**\n3. **Solve the Middle Layer Edges**\n4. **Solve the Yellow Cross**\n5. **Position the Yellow Edges**\n6. **Position the Yellow Corners**\n7. **Orient the Yellow Corners**\n\nGiven the complexity of solving a Rubik's Cube, and the fact that each cube can have a unique scramble, I will provide a generic solution outline. However, for a specific scramble, the exact sequence of moves can vary. \n\nHere's a generic solution outline in Singmaster notation, with each move separated as requested:\n\n```\n1. Solve the White Cross:\n   - F R U R' U' F'\n\n2. Solve the White Corners:\n   - U R U' L' U R' U' L\n\n3. Solve the Middle Layer Edges:\n   - U R U' R' U' F' U F\n\n4. Solve the Yellow Cross:\n   - F R U R' U' F'\n\n5. Position the Yellow Edges:\n   - R U R' U R U2 R' U\n\n6. Position the Yellow Corners:\n   - U R U' L' U R' U' L\n\n7. Orient the Yellow Corners:\n   - R U R' U R U2 R' U\n```\n\nThis is a generic solution outline. For a specific scramble, the exact sequence of moves can vary, and solving a specific cube requires analyzing the current state of the cube and applying the appropriate algorithms. If you have a specific scramble, you can use a Rubik's Cube solver or software to get the exact sequence of moves."
