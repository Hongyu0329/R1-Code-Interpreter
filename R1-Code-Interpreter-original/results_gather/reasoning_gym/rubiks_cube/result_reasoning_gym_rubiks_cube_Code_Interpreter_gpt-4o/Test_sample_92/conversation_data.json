    "\nassistant > Solving a Rubik's Cube involves a series of algorithmic steps. The solution can be broken down into several stages, each with its own set of moves. The Singmaster notation is used to describe these moves, where:\n\n- U = Up face\n- D = Down face\n- L = Left face\n- R = Right face\n- F = Front face\n- B = Back face\n- A letter by itself (e.g., U) means a 90-degree clockwise rotation of that face.\n- A letter followed by an apostrophe (e.g., U') means a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation.\n- A letter followed by a 2 (e.g., U2) means a 180-degree rotation.\n\nGiven the complexity of solving a Rubik's Cube, I will provide a step-by-step solution using the beginner's method. This method involves solving the cube layer by layer.\n\nLet's proceed with the solution:\n\n1. **Solve the White Cross**\n2. **Solve the White Corners**\n3. **Solve the Middle Layer Edges**\n4. **Solve the Yellow Cross**\n5. **Position the Yellow Edges**\n6. **Position the Yellow Corners**\n7. **Orient the Yellow Corners**\n\nI will now provide the solution in Singmaster notation. Please note that this solution is specific to the given cube configuration. \n\n<<<\n1. F R U R' U' F'\n2. U R U' R' U R U' R'\n3. U U L U L' U L U L'\n4. F U R U' R' F'\n5. R U R' U R U U R'\n6. U R U' L' U R' U' L\n7. U U R U R' U R U U R'\n>>> \n\nThis solution is a general guide and may need adjustments based on the specific cube configuration."
