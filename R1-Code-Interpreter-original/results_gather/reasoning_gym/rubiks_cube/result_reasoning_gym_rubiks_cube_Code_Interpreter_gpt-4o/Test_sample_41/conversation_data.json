    "\nassistant > Solving a Rubik's Cube involves a series of algorithmic moves. The Singmaster notation is a way to describe these moves. Here's a brief explanation of the notation:\n\n- **U**: Rotate the upper face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- **U'**: Rotate the upper face 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n- **D**: Rotate the down face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- **D'**: Rotate the down face 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n- **L**: Rotate the left face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- **L'**: Rotate the left face 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n- **R**: Rotate the right face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- **R'**: Rotate the right face 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n- **F**: Rotate the front face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- **F'**: Rotate the front face 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n- **B**: Rotate the back face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- **B'**: Rotate the back face 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n\nGiven the complexity of solving a Rubik's Cube, the solution typically involves multiple steps, including solving the cross, corners, middle layer, and finally the top layer.\n\nHowever, providing a complete solution for a scrambled cube requires a detailed analysis of the current state of the cube. Since I can't physically manipulate the cube, I'll provide a general solution approach. You can apply these steps to solve the cube:\n\n1. **Solve the White Cross**: Align the white edge pieces with the center pieces.\n2. **Solve the White Corners**: Position the white corner pieces correctly.\n3. **Solve the Middle Layer**: Position the edge pieces in the middle layer.\n4. **Solve the Yellow Cross**: Form a yellow cross on the top face.\n5. **Position the Yellow Edges**: Correctly position the yellow edge pieces.\n6. **Position the Yellow Corners**: Correctly position the yellow corner pieces.\n7. **Orient the Yellow Corners**: Rotate the yellow corners to complete the cube.\n\nFor a specific solution, you would need to apply algorithms for each step based on the current state of the cube. Since I can't physically manipulate the cube, I recommend using a Rubik's Cube solver or following a detailed guide to apply these steps to your specific cube configuration.\n\nIf you have a specific step or part of the cube you need help with, feel free to ask!"
