1. Solve the white cross on the top face.
2. Solve the white corners to complete the first layer.
3. Solve the middle layer edges.
4. Solve the yellow cross on the top face.
5. Position the yellow edges correctly.
6. Position the yellow corners correctly.
7. Orient the yellow corners to complete the cube.

Here is the step-by-step solution in Singmaster notation:

1. White Cross:
   - F R U R' U' F'

2. White Corners:
   - U R U' L' U R' U' L

3. Middle Layer Edges:
   - U R U' R' U' F' U F
   - U' L' U L U F U' F'

4. Yellow Cross:
   - F R U R' U' F'

5. Position Yellow Edges:
   - R U R' U R U U R'

6. Position Yellow Corners:
   - U R U' L' U R' U' L

7. Orient Yellow Corners:
   - R U U R' U' R U' R'
   - U R U' L' U R' U' L

Repeat the necessary steps until the cube is solved.
