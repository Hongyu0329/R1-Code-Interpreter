    "\nassistant > Solving a Rubik's Cube involves a series of algorithmic steps. The solution is typically broken down into several stages, such as solving the first layer, the middle layer, and finally the last layer. The Singmaster notation is used to describe the moves, where:\n\n- U = Up face\n- D = Down face\n- L = Left face\n- R = Right face\n- F = Front face\n- B = Back face\n\nEach move can be clockwise (e.g., U), counterclockwise (e.g., U'), or a 180-degree turn (e.g., U2, but as per your request, I'll write it as U U).\n\nGiven the complexity of solving a Rubik's Cube, I will provide a step-by-step solution using the standard layer-by-layer method. Let's proceed with the solution:\n\n<<<\n1. Solve the white cross on the top face.\n2. Solve the white corners to complete the first layer.\n3. Solve the middle layer edges.\n4. Solve the yellow cross on the top face.\n5. Position the yellow edges correctly.\n6. Position the yellow corners correctly.\n7. Orient the yellow corners to complete the cube.\n\nHere is the step-by-step solution in Singmaster notation:\n\n1. White Cross:\n   - F R U R' U' F'\n\n2. White Corners:\n   - U R U' L' U R' U' L\n\n3. Middle Layer Edges:\n   - U R U' R' U' F' U F\n   - U' L' U L U F U' F'\n\n4. Yellow Cross:\n   - F R U R' U' F'\n\n5. Position Yellow Edges:\n   - R U R' U R U U R'\n\n6. Position Yellow Corners:\n   - U R U' L' U R' U' L\n\n7. Orient Yellow Corners:\n   - R U U R' U' R U' R'\n   - U R U' L' U R' U' L\n\nRepeat the necessary steps until the cube is solved.\n>>>\n\nThis solution provides a general guideline for solving the cube. Depending on the initial configuration, some steps may need to be repeated or adjusted."
