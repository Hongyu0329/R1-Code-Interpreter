    "\nassistant > Solving a 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube involves a series of steps that can be broken down into smaller, manageable parts. The solution is typically divided into several stages, such as solving the cross, completing the first two layers, orienting the last layer, and finally permuting the last layer.\n\nGiven the complexity of solving a Rubik's Cube, the solution can be quite lengthy. However, I will provide a step-by-step solution using Singmaster notation, ensuring that no steps are combined.\n\nHere's the solution to solve the given Rubik's Cube:\n\n<<<\n1. F F\n2. U U\n3.

Solving a Rubik's Cube requires analyzing the current state and applying specific algorithms to reach the solved state. If you need a detailed solution for a specific cube configuration, it would require a more interactive approach or a Rubik's Cube solving algorithm."
