    "\nassistant > Solving a Rubik's Cube involves a series of algorithmic moves. The Singmaster notation is a widely used notation for describing these moves. Here's a brief explanation of the notation:\n\n- **U**: Turn the upper face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- **U'**: Turn the upper face 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n- **D**: Turn the down face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- **D'**: Turn the down face 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n- **L**: Turn the left face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- **L'**: Turn the left face 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n- **R**: Turn the right face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- **R'**: Turn the right face 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n- **F**: Turn the front face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- **F'**: Turn the front face 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n- **B**: Turn the back face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- **B'**: Turn the back face 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n\nGiven the complexity of solving a Rubik's Cube, the solution typically involves multiple steps, including solving the cross, corners, middle layer, and final layer. \n\nHowever, without a specific algorithmic approach or a Rubik's Cube solver, providing a step-by-step solution for a scrambled cube is not feasible manually. Typically, a computer algorithm or a Rubik's Cube solver would be used to generate the solution.\n\nFor this specific cube, I will provide a generic solution approach, but please note that the exact sequence of moves will depend on the specific configuration of the cube:\n\n1. **Solve the White Cross**: Align the white edge pieces with the center pieces.\n2. **Solve the White Corners**: Position the white corner pieces correctly.\n3. **Solve the Middle Layer**: Position the edge pieces in the middle layer.\n4. **Solve the Yellow Cross**: Form a yellow cross on the top face.\n5. **Position the Yellow Corners**: Move the yellow corners to their correct positions.\n6. **Orient the Yellow Corners**: Rotate the yellow corners to match the top face.\n7. **Position the Yellow Edges**: Move the yellow edge pieces to their correct positions.\n\nSince I cannot provide a specific solution without a solver, I recommend using a Rubik's Cube solving algorithm or an online solver tool to generate the exact sequence of moves for your cube."
