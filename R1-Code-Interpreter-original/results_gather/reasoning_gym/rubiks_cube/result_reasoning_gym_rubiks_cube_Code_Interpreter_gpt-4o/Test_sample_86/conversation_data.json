    "\nassistant > Solving a Rubik's Cube involves a series of algorithmic steps. The solution can be broken down into several stages, such as solving the first layer, the middle layer, and finally the last layer. The Singmaster notation is used to describe the moves, where:\n\n- U: Up face\n- D: Down face\n- L: Left face\n- R: Right face\n- F: Front face\n- B: Back face\n\nEach letter represents a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the face, and a counter-clockwise rotation is represented by appending an apostrophe (e.g., U').\n\nGiven the complexity of solving a Rubik's Cube, I will provide a step-by-step solution using the standard layer-by-layer method. Let's proceed with solving the cube.\nassistant > To solve the Rubik's Cube, we will follow the standard layer-by-layer method. Here is a step-by-step solution using Singmaster notation:\n\n1. **Solve the White Cross:**\n   - Align the white edge pieces with the center pieces of the adjacent faces.\n\n2. **Solve the White Corners:**\n   - Position the white corner pieces in their correct places.\n\n3. **Solve the Middle Layer Edges:**\n   - Position the edge pieces of the middle layer.\n\n4. **Solve the Yellow Cross:**\n   - Form a yellow cross on the top face.\n\n5. **Position the Yellow Edges:**\n   - Ensure the yellow edge pieces are in the correct position.\n\n6. **Position the Yellow Corners:**\n   - Place the yellow corner pieces in their correct positions.\n\n7. **Orient the Yellow Corners:**\n   - Rotate the yellow corner pieces to complete the cube.\n\nHere is the solution in Singmaster notation:\n\n```\n1. White Cross:\n   F R U R' U' F'\n\n2. White Corners:\n   U R U' L' U R' U' L\n\n3. Middle Layer Edges:\n   U R U' R' U' F' U F\n\n4. Yellow Cross:\n   F R U R' U' F'\n\n5. Position Yellow Edges:\n   R U R' U R U U R'\n\n6. Position Yellow Corners:\n   U R U' L' U R' U' L\n\n7. Orient Yellow Corners:\n   R U R' U R U U R'\n```\n\nPlease note that this is a generic solution and may need adjustments based on the specific configuration of your cube. The solution provided is a basic guide to solving a Rubik's Cube using the layer-by-layer method."
