    "\nassistant > To solve a Rubik's Cube, we can use a series of algorithms that manipulate the cube's pieces into the correct positions. The Singmaster notation is a standard notation used to describe these moves. Here's a brief overview of the notation:\n\n- **U**: Rotate the top face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- **U'**: Rotate the top face 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n- **D**: Rotate the bottom face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- **D'**: Rotate the bottom face 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n- **L**: Rotate the left face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- **L'**: Rotate the left face 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n- **R**: Rotate the right face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- **R'**: Rotate the right face 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n- **F**: Rotate the front face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- **F'**: Rotate the front face 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n- **B**: Rotate the back face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- **B'**: Rotate the back face 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n\nGiven the complexity of solving a Rubik's Cube, the solution involves multiple steps, including solving the cross, corners, middle layer, and final layer. However, providing a complete solution for a specific scrambled cube requires a detailed analysis of the current state of the cube.\n\nSince I cannot directly manipulate or analyze the cube's state from the description alone, I will provide a general solution approach. If you have a specific tool or software to analyze the cube's state, you can input the current configuration to get a step-by-step solution.\n\nHere's a general approach to solving a Rubik's Cube:\n\n1. **Solve the White Cross**: Align the white edge pieces with the center pieces.\n2. **Solve the White Corners**: Position the white corner pieces correctly.\n3. **Solve the Middle Layer Edges**: Position the edge pieces in the middle layer.\n4. **Solve the Yellow Cross**: Form a yellow cross on the top face.\n5. **Position the Yellow Corners**: Move the yellow corners to their correct positions.\n6. **Orient the Yellow Corners**: Rotate the yellow corners to match the top face.\n7. **Position the Yellow Edges**: Move the yellow edge pieces to their correct positions.\n\nIf you have access to a Rubik's Cube solver tool, you can input the current state to get a specific solution in Singmaster notation.
