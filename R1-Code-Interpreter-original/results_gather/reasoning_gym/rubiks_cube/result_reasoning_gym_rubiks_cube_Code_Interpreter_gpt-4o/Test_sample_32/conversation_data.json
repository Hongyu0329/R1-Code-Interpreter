    "\nassistant > Solving a 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube involves a series of steps that can be broken down into solving the cross, corners, middle layer, and finally the last layer. The solution is typically expressed in Singmaster notation, which uses the following moves:\n\n- U (Up)\n- D (Down)\n- L (Left)\n- R (Right)\n- F (Front)\n- B (Back)\n\nEach move can be clockwise (e.g., U) or counterclockwise (e.g., U').\n\nGiven the complexity of solving a Rubik's Cube, the solution will be a sequence of these moves. However, without a specific algorithmic approach or a solver, providing an exact solution for the given scrambled state is not feasible manually. \n\nInstead, I can guide you through a general solution approach or use a Rubik's Cube solver algorithm to find the exact sequence of moves. Would you like me to proceed with a general solution approach or attempt to solve it algorithmically?"
