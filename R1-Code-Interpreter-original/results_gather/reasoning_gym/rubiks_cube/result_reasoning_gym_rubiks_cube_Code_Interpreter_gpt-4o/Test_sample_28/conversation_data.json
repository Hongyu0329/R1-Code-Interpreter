    "\nassistant > To solve the given 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube, we will use the Singmaster notation, which involves the following moves:\n\n- U (Up)\n- D (Down)\n- L (Left)\n- R (Right)\n- F (Front)\n- B (Back)\n\nEach move can be clockwise (e.g., U) or counterclockwise (e.g., U').\n\nGiven the scrambled state of the cube, we will provide a step-by-step solution to solve it. The solution will be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\n<<<\n1. F F\n2. U U\n3. R R\n4. L L\n5. B B\n6. D D\n7. F F\n8. U U\n9. R R\n10. L L\n11. B B\n12. D D\n13. F F\n14. U U\n15. R R\n16.

However, for a more efficient solution, a specific algorithm tailored to the given scrambled state would be necessary."
