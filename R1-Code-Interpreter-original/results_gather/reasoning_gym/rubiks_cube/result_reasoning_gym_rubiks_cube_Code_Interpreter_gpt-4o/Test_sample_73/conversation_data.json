    "\nassistant > Solving a Rubik's Cube involves a series of algorithmic steps. The solution is typically broken down into several stages, such as solving the cross, corners, middle layer, and finally the top layer. The Singmaster notation is used to describe the moves, where:\n\n- U = Up face\n- D = Down face\n- L = Left face\n- R = Right face\n- F = Front face\n- B = Back face\n\nEach letter represents a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the face, while a counterclockwise rotation is denoted by adding an apostrophe (e.g., U').\n\nGiven the complexity of solving a Rubik's Cube, especially from a random configuration, the solution involves a series of moves that are typically determined by algorithms. However, without a specific solving algorithm or software, providing an exact solution from a random configuration is not feasible manually in a short time.\n\nFor a complete solution, a Rubik's Cube solving algorithm or software would be used to determine the exact sequence of moves. If you have access to such a tool, you can input the current state of the cube to get the solution.\n\nIf you would like, I can guide you through the general steps of solving a Rubik's Cube, or if you have access to a Rubik's Cube solver, you can use the provided configuration to find the solution."
