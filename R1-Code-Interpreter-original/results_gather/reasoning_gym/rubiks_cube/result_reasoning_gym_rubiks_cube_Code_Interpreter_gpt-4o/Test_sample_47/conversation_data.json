    "\nassistant > Solving a Rubik's Cube involves a series of steps and algorithms. The solution is typically broken down into stages, such as solving the cross, corners, middle layer, and finally the top layer. Given the complexity of solving a Rubik's Cube, especially from a specific scrambled state, the solution can be quite lengthy.\n\nHowever, I can provide a step-by-step solution using the Singmaster notation, which involves the following moves:\n\n- **U**: Rotate the top face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- **U'**: Rotate the top face 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n- **D**: Rotate the bottom face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- **D'**: Rotate the bottom face 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n- **L**: Rotate the left face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- **L'**: Rotate the left face 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n- **R**: Rotate the right face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- **R'**: Rotate the right face 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n- **F**: Rotate the front face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- **F'**: Rotate the front face 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n- **B**: Rotate the back face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- **B'**: Rotate the back face 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n\nTo solve the cube from the given state, I will use a Rubik's Cube solver algorithm to generate the solution. Let's proceed with that.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Importing the necessary library to solve the Rubik's Cube\nfrom rubik_solver import utils\n\n# Defining the scrambled state of the Rubik's Cube\n# The cube is represented in a flattened string format\n# The order is: U (Up), R (Right), F (Front), D (Down), L (Left), B (Back)\nscrambled_state = (\n    \"GOR\"  # U face\n    \"YYG\"\n    \"OOG\"\n    \"YBG\"  # L face\n    \"YRY\"\n    \"YRY\"\n    \"WWR\"  # F face\n    \"RGB\"\n    \"RGB\"\n    \"WWB\"  # R face\n    \"WOO\"\n    \"WGG\"\n    \"BRO\"  # B face\n    \"WWY\"\n    \"BRY\"\n    \"WBO\"  # D face\n    \"GBO\"\n    \"GRO\"\n)\n\n# Solving the Rubik's Cube using the solver\nsolution = utils.solve(scrambled_state, 'Kociemba')\n\n# Converting the solution to a format without combined moves\nexpanded_solution = []\nfor move in solution:\n    if len(move) == 2 and move[1] == '2':\n        expanded_solution.extend([move[0], move[0]])\n    else:\n        expanded_solution.append(move)\n\n# Joining the solution into a single string\nexpanded_solution_str = ' '.join(expanded_solution)\nexpanded_solution_str\nassistant > It seems that the necessary library to solve the Rubik's Cube is not available in this environment. However, I can guide you through the general steps to solve a Rubik's Cube using the layer-by-layer method. This method involves solving the cube in layers, starting from the bottom layer and working up to the top layer.\n\n### General Steps to Solve a Rubik's Cube:\n\n1. **Solve the White Cross:**\n   - Form a cross on the white face by aligning the edge pieces with the center pieces.\n\n2. **Solve the White Corners:**\n   - Position the white corner pieces to complete the first layer.\n\n3. **Solve the Middle Layer:**\n   - Position the edge pieces of the middle layer without disturbing the solved white layer.\n\n4. **Solve the Yellow Cross:**\n   - Form a cross on the yellow face.\n\n5. **Position the Yellow Edges:**\n   - Correctly position the yellow edge pieces.\n\n6. **Position the Yellow Corners:**\n   - Position the yellow corner pieces in their correct locations.\n\n7. **Orient the Yellow Corners:**\n   - Rotate the yellow corner pieces to complete the cube.\n\n### Singmaster Notation:\n- **U**: Rotate the top face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- **U'**: Rotate the top face 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n- **D**: Rotate the bottom face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- **D'**: Rotate the bottom face 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n- **L**: Rotate the left face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- **L'**: Rotate the left face 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n- **R**: Rotate the right face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- **R'**: Rotate the right face 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n- **F**: Rotate the front face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- **F'**: Rotate the front face 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n- **B**: Rotate the back face 90 degrees clockwise.\n- **B'**: Rotate the back face 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n\nIf you have access to a Rubik's Cube solver or simulator, you can input the scrambled state to get a step-by-step solution. Alternatively, you can follow the general steps above to manually solve the cube."
