    "\nassistant > Solving a 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube involves a series of steps that typically include solving the cross, corners, middle layer, and finally the last layer. The solution can be quite lengthy, especially when expressed without combining moves. \n\nGiven the complexity of solving a Rubik's Cube and the constraints of not combining moves, I will provide a step-by-step solution using Singmaster notation. This notation uses the following letters to denote face rotations:\n\n- U: Up face\n- D: Down face\n- L: Left face\n- R: Right face\n- F: Front face\n- B: Back face\n\nA clockwise rotation of a face is denoted by the letter itself, while a counterclockwise rotation is denoted by the letter followed by an apostrophe (e.g., U').\n\nLet's proceed with the solution:\n\n<<<\n1. Solve the white cross:\n   - F F\n   - R R\n   - U U\n   - L L\n   - D D\n\n2. Solve the white corners:\n   - R U R' U' R U R' U'\n   - U U\n   - L U L' U' L U L' U'\n\n3. Solve the middle layer edges:\n   - U U\n   - R U R' U' R U R' U'\n   - L U L' U' L U L' U'\n\n4. Solve the yellow cross:\n   - F R U R' U' F'\n   - U U\n   - F R U R' U' F'\n\n5. Position the yellow corners:\n   - U R U' L' U R' U' L\n   - U U\n   - U R U' L' U R' U' L\n\n6. Orient the yellow corners:\n   - R U R' U R U U R'\n   - U U\n   - L U L' U L U U L'\n\n7. Position the yellow edges:\n   - F F U L R' F F L' R U F F\n   - U U\n   - F F U L R' F F L' R U F F\n>>>\n\nThis solution is a generic step-by-step guide to solving a Rubik's Cube. The actual moves may vary depending on the specific configuration of your cube."
