    "\nassistant > Solving a Rubik's Cube involves a series of algorithmic steps. The provided configuration is a scrambled state of a 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube. To solve it, we will use the Singmaster notation, which involves the following moves:\n\n- U (Up)\n- D (Down)\n- L (Left)\n- R (Right)\n- F (Front)\n- B (Back)\n- Each move can be followed by an apostrophe (') to indicate a counter-clockwise turn.\n\nGiven the complexity of solving a Rubik's Cube, the solution will be broken down into several stages:\n\n1. Solve the white cross.\n2. Solve the white corners.\n3. Solve the middle layer edges.\n4. Solve the yellow cross.\n5. Position the yellow edges.\n6. Position the yellow corners.\n7. Orient the yellow corners.\n\nLet's proceed with solving the cube step by step. \n\nNote: The solution will be specific to the given scrambled state. \n\n<<<\n1.
