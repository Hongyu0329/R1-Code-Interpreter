    "\nassistant > To solve the given Rubik's Cube configuration, we will use the Singmaster notation, which involves the following moves:\n\n- U (Up)\n- D (Down)\n- L (Left)\n- R (Right)\n- F (Front)\n- B (Back)\n- Each move can be followed by an apostrophe (') to indicate a counter-clockwise turn.\n\nGiven the complexity of solving a Rubik's Cube, I will use a step-by-step approach to derive the solution. Let's proceed with solving the cube.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Importing the necessary library to solve the Rubik's Cube\nfrom rubik_solver import utils\n\n# Defining the scrambled state of the Rubik's Cube\n# The cube is represented in the order: U, R, F, D, L, B\nscrambled_state = (\n    'YYYYYYB'  # U (Up)\n    'RRRGGOWO'  # R (Right)\n    'RRRGGOOB'  # F (Front)\n    'WWGOOWW'  # D (Down)\n    'GGRGGOOB'  # L (Left)\n    'BBBRRW'   # B (Back)\n)\n\n# Solving the Rubik's Cube\nsolution = utils.solve(scrambled_state, 'Kociemba')\n\n# Converting the solution to a string with each move separated by a space\nsolution_str = ' '.join(solution)\nsolution_str\nassistant > It seems that the necessary library to solve the Rubik's Cube is not available in this environment. However, I can guide you through the process of solving the cube manually using a standard method. \n\nTo solve a Rubik's Cube, we typically follow these steps:\n\n1. **Solve the White Cross**: Align the white edge pieces with the center pieces.\n2. **Solve the White Corners**: Position the white corner pieces correctly.\n3. **Solve the Middle Layer Edges**: Position the edge pieces in the middle layer.\n4. **Solve the Yellow Cross**: Form a yellow cross on the top face.\n5. **Position the Yellow Edges**: Align the yellow edge pieces with the correct centers.\n6. **Position the Yellow Corners**: Place the yellow corners in the correct position.\n7. **Orient the Yellow Corners**: Rotate the yellow corners to complete the cube.\n\nSince I can't compute the exact solution here, I recommend using an online Rubik's Cube solver or a mobile app where you can input the current state of your cube, and it will provide you with a step-by-step solution in Singmaster notation.\n\nIf you have any questions about the steps or need further guidance, feel free to ask!"
