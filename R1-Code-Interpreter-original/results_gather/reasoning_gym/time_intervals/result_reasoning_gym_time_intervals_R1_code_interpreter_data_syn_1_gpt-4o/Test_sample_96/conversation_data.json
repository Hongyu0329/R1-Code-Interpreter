    "To determine the duration of the video call, we need to calculate the difference between the start time and the end time. The start time is 12:32:23, and the end time is 14:58:48. We can break this down into hours, minutes, and seconds to find the total duration.\n\n1. **Calculate the difference in seconds**: \n   - Start time in seconds: \\(12 \\times 3600 + 32 \\times 60 + 23\\)\n   - End time in seconds: \\(14 \\times 3600 + 58 \\times 60 + 48\\)\n\n2. **Subtract the start time from the end time** to get the total duration in seconds.\n\n3. **Convert the total seconds back to HH:MM:SS** format.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Define start and end times in HH:MM:SS\nstart_time = (12, 32, 23)\nend_time = (14, 58, 48)\n\n# Convert start and end times to total seconds\nstart_seconds = start_time[0] * 3600 + start_time[1] * 60 + start_time[2]\nend_seconds = end_time[0] * 3600 + end_time[1] * 60 + end_time[2]\n\n# Calculate the duration in seconds\nduration_seconds = end_seconds - start_seconds\n\n# Convert the duration back to HH:MM:SS\nhours = duration_seconds // 3600\nminutes = (duration_seconds % 3600) // 60\nseconds = duration_seconds % 60\n\n# Print the result in HH:MM:SS format\nprint(f\"{hours:02}:{minutes:02}:{seconds:02}\")\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the duration of the call and print it in the required format. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output indicates that the duration of the video call is 2 hours, 26 minutes, and 25 seconds. \n\nTherefore, the duration of the call in HH:MM:SS format is:\n\n<<<02:26:25>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    A video call started at 12:32:23 and ended at 14:58:48.
