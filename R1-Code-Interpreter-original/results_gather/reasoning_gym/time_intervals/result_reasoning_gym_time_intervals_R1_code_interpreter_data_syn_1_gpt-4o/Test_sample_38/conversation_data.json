    "To determine the time elapsed from 09:44 to 17:56, we need to calculate the difference between these two times. The process involves:\n\n1. Converting both times into minutes since midnight.\n2. Subtracting the earlier time from the later time to find the difference in minutes.\n3. Converting the difference back into hours and minutes.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- 09:44 is 9 hours and 44 minutes since midnight. In minutes, this is \\(9 \\times 60 + 44 = 584\\) minutes.\n- 17:56 is 17 hours and 56 minutes since midnight. In minutes, this is \\(17 \\times 60 + 56 = 1076\\) minutes.\n\nNow, we find the difference in minutes:\n\n\\[ \\text{Difference in minutes} = 1076 - 584 \\]\n\nFinally, we convert the difference back into hours and minutes.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Convert times to minutes since midnight\nstart_time_minutes = 9 * 60 + 44\nend_time_minutes = 17 * 60 + 56\n\n# Calculate the difference in minutes\ndifference_minutes = end_time_minutes - start_time_minutes\n\n# Convert the difference back to hours and minutes\nhours = difference_minutes // 60\nminutes = difference_minutes % 60\n\n# Print the result in HH:MM format\nprint(f\"{hours:02}:{minutes:02}\")\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the elapsed time.",
    "The code execution has provided the result, which indicates that the time elapsed from 09:44 to 17:56 is 8 hours and 12 minutes. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<08:12>>>"
