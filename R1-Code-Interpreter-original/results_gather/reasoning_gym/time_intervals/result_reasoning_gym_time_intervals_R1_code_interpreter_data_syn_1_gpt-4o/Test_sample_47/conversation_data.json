    "To determine the duration of the meeting, we need to calculate the difference between the start time and the end time. The start time is 14:22:38, and the end time is 17:20:37. We can break this down into hours, minutes, and seconds and perform the subtraction accordingly.\n\n1. **Calculate the difference in seconds**: \n   - Start seconds: 38\n   - End seconds: 37\n   - Since 37 is less than 38, we need to borrow 1 minute (60 seconds) from the minutes.\n\n2. **Calculate the difference in minutes**:\n   - Start minutes: 22\n   - End minutes: 20\n   - After borrowing 1 minute for the seconds calculation, the end minutes become 19.\n   - Since 19 is less than 22, we need to borrow 1 hour (60 minutes) from the hours.\n\n3. **Calculate the difference in hours**:\n   - Start hours: 14\n   - End hours: 17\n   - After borrowing 1 hour for the minutes calculation, the end hours become 16.\n\nNow, let's calculate the differences using these adjusted values.\n\n```python\n# Start time\nstart_hours = 14\nstart_minutes = 22\nstart_seconds = 38\n\n# End time\nend_hours = 17\nend_minutes = 20\nend_seconds = 37\n\n# Adjust for borrowing\nif end_seconds < start_seconds:\n    end_seconds += 60\n    end_minutes -= 1\n\nif end_minutes < start_minutes:\n    end_minutes += 60\n    end_hours -= 1\n\n# Calculate differences\ndiff_hours = end_hours - start_hours\ndiff_minutes = end_minutes - start_minutes\ndiff_seconds = end_seconds - start_seconds\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"{diff_hours:02}:{diff_minutes:02}:{diff_seconds:02}\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the duration of the meeting.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output indicates that the meeting lasted for 2 hours, 57 minutes, and 59 seconds. \n\nTherefore, the duration of the meeting is:\n\n<<<02:57:59>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    A meeting started at 14:22:38 and ended at 17:20:37.
