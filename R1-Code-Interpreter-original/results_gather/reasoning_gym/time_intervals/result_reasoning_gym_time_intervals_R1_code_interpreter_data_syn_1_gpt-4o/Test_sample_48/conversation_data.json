    "To determine the total backup duration, we need to calculate the difference between the start and end times. The start time is 12:34:57.377, and the end time is 20:14:35.750. We will convert these times into a format that allows us to easily compute the difference, such as total milliseconds since the start of the day, and then convert the result back into the desired format of HH:MM:SS.mmm.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Convert both start and end times into total milliseconds from the start of the day.\n2. Subtract the start time in milliseconds from the end time in milliseconds to get the duration in milliseconds.\n3. Convert the duration in milliseconds back into the format HH:MM:SS.mmm.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# Define the start and end times\nstart_time_str = \"12:34:57.377\"\nend_time_str = \"20:14:35.750\"\n\n# Convert the time strings to datetime objects\nstart_time = datetime.strptime(start_time_str, \"%H:%M:%S.%f\")\nend_time = datetime.strptime(end_time_str, \"%H:%M:%S.%f\")\n\n# Calculate the difference in time\nduration = end_time - start_time\n\n# Extract hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds from the duration\nhours, remainder = divmod(duration.seconds, 3600)\nminutes, seconds = divmod(remainder, 60)\nmilliseconds = duration.microseconds // 1000\n\n# Format the duration as HH:MM:SS.mmm\nformatted_duration = f\"{hours:02}:{minutes:02}:{seconds:02}.{milliseconds:03}\"\n\nprint(formatted_duration)\n```\n\nThis script will calculate the total backup duration and format it as required. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output indicates that the total backup duration is 7 hours, 39 minutes, 38 seconds, and 373 milliseconds. \n\nTherefore, the total backup duration is:\n\n<<<07:39:38.373>>>"
