    "To determine the duration of the meeting, we need to calculate the difference between the start time and the end time. The meeting started at 11:37 and ended at 11:58. \n\n1. **Extract the start and end times:**\n   - Start time: 11:37\n   - End time: 11:58\n\n2. **Calculate the difference in minutes:**\n   - The hour difference is 0 hours since both times are within the same hour.\n   - The minute difference is 58 minutes - 37 minutes.\n\n3. **Compute the total duration:**\n   - Since the hour difference is 0, the total duration is simply the difference in minutes.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define start and end times\nstart_hour, start_minute = 11, 37\nend_hour, end_minute = 11, 58\n\n# Calculate the difference in minutes\nduration_minutes = (end_hour * 60 + end_minute) - (start_hour * 60 + start_minute)\n\n# Convert the duration into hours and minutes\nduration_hours = duration_minutes // 60\nduration_remaining_minutes = duration_minutes % 60\n\n# Print the result in HH:MM format\nprint(f\"{duration_hours:02}:{duration_remaining_minutes:02}\")\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the duration of the meeting.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output indicates that the meeting lasted for 21 minutes. The calculation was straightforward since both the start and end times were within the same hour.\n\nThe meeting duration is therefore:\n\n<<<00:21>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    A meeting started at 11:37 and ended at 11:58.
