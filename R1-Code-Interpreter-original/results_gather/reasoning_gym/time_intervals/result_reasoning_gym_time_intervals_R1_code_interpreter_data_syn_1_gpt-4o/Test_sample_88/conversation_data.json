    "To determine the duration of the meeting, we need to calculate the difference between the start and end times, taking into account the time zones.\n\n1. **Convert the start and end times to a common time zone**: The start time is in UTC-2, and the end time is in UTC-6. To simplify the calculation, we can convert both times to UTC.\n\n2. **Calculate the time difference**: Once both times are in the same time zone, we can subtract the start time from the end time to find the duration.\n\n3. **Format the duration**: Convert the duration from seconds to the format D days, HH:MM.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the exact duration.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\nimport pytz\n\n# Define the start and end times with their respective time zones\nstart_time_str = \"2811-11-24 23:37:42\"\nend_time_str = \"2812-01-23 02:57:01\"\n\n# Define the time zones\nstart_tz = pytz.timezone('Etc/GMT+2')  # UTC-2\nend_tz = pytz.timezone('Etc/GMT+6')    # UTC-6\n\n# Parse the datetime strings and localize them to their respective time zones\nstart_time = start_tz.localize(datetime.strptime(start_time_str, \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\"))\nend_time = end_tz.localize(datetime.strptime(end_time_str, \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\"))\n\n# Convert both times to UTC\nstart_time_utc = start_time.astimezone(pytz.utc)\nend_time_utc = end_time.astimezone(pytz.utc)\n\n# Calculate the duration\nduration = end_time_utc - start_time_utc\n\n# Extract days, hours, and minutes\ndays = duration.days\nhours, remainder = divmod(duration.seconds, 3600)\nminutes, _ = divmod(remainder, 60)\n\n# Print the result in the desired format\nprint(f\"{days} days, {hours:02}:{minutes:02}\")\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the duration of the meeting in the format D days, HH:MM.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the duration of the meeting. The meeting lasted for 59 days, 7 hours, and 19 minutes. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<59 days, 07:19>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
