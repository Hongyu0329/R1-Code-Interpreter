    "To determine the duration of the flight, we need to calculate the difference between the departure and arrival times. The departure time is \"Mon Mar 02 2229 00:56:24\" and the arrival time is \"Fri Apr 17 2229 03:17:28\". \n\nThe steps to solve this are as follows:\n1. Parse the given date and time strings into a format that can be used for calculation.\n2. Calculate the difference between the two datetime objects.\n3. Convert the difference into the format \"D days, HH:MM\".\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these calculations.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# Define the departure and arrival times\ndeparture_time = \"Mon Mar 02 2229 00:56:24\"\narrival_time = \"Fri Apr 17 2229 03:17:28\"\n\n# Parse the date strings into datetime objects\ndeparture_dt = datetime.strptime(departure_time, \"%a %b %d %Y %H:%M:%S\")\narrival_dt = datetime.strptime(arrival_time, \"%a %b %d %Y %H:%M:%S\")\n\n# Calculate the difference between the two datetime objects\nflight_duration = arrival_dt - departure_dt\n\n# Extract days, hours, and minutes from the duration\ndays = flight_duration.days\nhours, remainder = divmod(flight_duration.seconds, 3600)\nminutes = remainder // 60\n\n# Print the result in the desired format\nprint(f\"{days} days, {hours:02}:{minutes:02}\")\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the duration of the flight and print it in the format \"D days, HH:MM\". Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the flight duration as 46 days, 02:21. \n\nNow, let's provide the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<46 days, 02:21>>>"
