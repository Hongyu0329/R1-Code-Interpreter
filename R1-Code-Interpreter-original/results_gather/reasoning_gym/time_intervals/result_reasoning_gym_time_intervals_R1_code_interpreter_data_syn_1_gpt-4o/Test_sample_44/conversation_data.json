    "To determine the duration of the meeting, we need to calculate the difference between the start and end times. The start time is 14:24:12.054, and the end time is 19:48:35.482. We will break down the time into hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds, and then compute the difference.\n\n1. Convert both times into a total number of milliseconds since the start of the day.\n2. Subtract the start time in milliseconds from the end time in milliseconds to get the duration in milliseconds.\n3. Convert the duration back into hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# Define the start and end times\nstart_time_str = \"14:24:12.054\"\nend_time_str = \"19:48:35.482\"\n\n# Convert the time strings to datetime objects\nstart_time = datetime.strptime(start_time_str, \"%H:%M:%S.%f\")\nend_time = datetime.strptime(end_time_str, \"%H:%M:%S.%f\")\n\n# Calculate the difference\nduration = end_time - start_time\n\n# Extract hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds from the duration\nhours, remainder = divmod(duration.seconds, 3600)\nminutes, seconds = divmod(remainder, 60)\nmilliseconds = duration.microseconds // 1000\n\n# Print the result in the format HH:MM:SS.mmm\nprint(f\"{hours:02}:{minutes:02}:{seconds:02}.{milliseconds:03}\")\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the duration of the meeting and print it in the required format. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output indicates that the meeting lasted for 5 hours, 24 minutes, 23 seconds, and 428 milliseconds. \n\nTherefore, the duration of the meeting is:\n\n<<<05:24:23.428>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    A meeting started at 14:24:12.054 and ended at 19:48:35.482.
