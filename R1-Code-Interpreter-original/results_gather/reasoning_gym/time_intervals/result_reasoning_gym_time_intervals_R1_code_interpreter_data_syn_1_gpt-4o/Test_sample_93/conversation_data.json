    "To determine the duration of the operation, we need to calculate the difference between the start time and the end time. The start time is 07:53:51, and the end time is 18:47:45. We can calculate the difference by converting these times into seconds since midnight, finding the difference, and then converting back to hours, minutes, and seconds.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Convert the start and end times into total seconds since midnight.\n2. Calculate the difference in seconds.\n3. Convert the difference back into hours, minutes, and seconds.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the exact duration.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# Define the start and end times\nstart_time = \"07:53:51\"\nend_time = \"18:47:45\"\n\n# Convert the times to datetime objects\nstart_dt = datetime.strptime(start_time, \"%H:%M:%S\")\nend_dt = datetime.strptime(end_time, \"%H:%M:%S\")\n\n# Calculate the difference in seconds\nduration_seconds = (end_dt - start_dt).seconds\n\n# Convert the difference back to hours, minutes, and seconds\nhours = duration_seconds // 3600\nminutes = (duration_seconds % 3600) // 60\nseconds = duration_seconds % 60\n\n# Print the duration in HH:MM:SS format\nprint(f\"{hours:02}:{minutes:02}:{seconds:02}\")\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the duration of the operation and print it in the required format.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output indicates that the operation duration is 10 hours, 53 minutes, and 54 seconds. \n\nTherefore, the duration of the operation is:\n\n<<<10:53:54>>>"
