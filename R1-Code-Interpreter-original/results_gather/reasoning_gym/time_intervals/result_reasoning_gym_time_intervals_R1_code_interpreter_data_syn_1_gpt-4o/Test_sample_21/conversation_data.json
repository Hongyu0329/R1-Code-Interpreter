    "To determine the duration of the video call, we need to calculate the difference between the start and end times, taking into account the time zones.\n\n1. **Start Time**: 2620-09-08 22:30:59 -0100\n   - This means the start time is in a time zone that is 1 hour behind UTC.\n\n2. **End Time**: 2620-12-09 17:28:10 +1100\n   - This means the end time is in a time zone that is 11 hours ahead of UTC.\n\n3. **Convert both times to UTC**:\n   - Start Time in UTC: 2620-09-08 23:30:59\n   - End Time in UTC: 2620-12-09 06:28:10\n\n4. **Calculate the difference** between the two UTC times to find the duration of the call.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Define the start and end times with their respective time zones\nstart_time_str = \"2620-09-08 22:30:59 -0100\"\nend_time_str = \"2620-12-09 17:28:10 +1100\"\n\n# Convert the time strings to datetime objects\nstart_time = datetime.strptime(start_time_str, \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %z\")\nend_time = datetime.strptime(end_time_str, \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %z\")\n\n# Convert both times to UTC\nstart_time_utc = start_time.astimezone(tz=None)\nend_time_utc = end_time.astimezone(tz=None)\n\n# Calculate the duration\nduration = end_time_utc - start_time_utc\n\n# Extract days, hours, minutes, and seconds from the duration\ndays = duration.days\nhours, remainder = divmod(duration.seconds, 3600)\nminutes, seconds = divmod(remainder, 60)\n\n# Print the result in the format D days, HH:MM:SS\nprint(f\"{days} days, {hours:02}:{minutes:02}:{seconds:02}\")\n```\n\nThis script will calculate the duration of the call in the desired format. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output indicates that the duration of the video call was 91 days, 6 hours, 57 minutes, and 11 seconds. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<91 days, 06:57:11>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
