    "To determine the operation duration, we need to calculate the difference between the start and end times, taking into account the time zones.\n\n1. **Start Time**: 2959-10-25 20:12:02 +0000\n2. **End Time**: 2959-11-19 12:33:46 -0100\n\nThe start time is in UTC (offset +0000), and the end time is in a time zone with an offset of -0100. To calculate the duration, we need to convert both times to the same time zone, preferably UTC, and then find the difference.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n- Convert the end time to UTC by adding 1 hour to account for the -0100 offset.\n- Calculate the difference between the two times.\n\nWe can use Python's `datetime` module to handle these calculations efficiently.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Define the start and end times with their respective time zones\nstart_time_str = \"2959-10-25 20:12:02 +0000\"\nend_time_str = \"2959-11-19 12:33:46 -0100\"\n\n# Parse the start and end times\nstart_time = datetime.strptime(start_time_str, \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %z\")\nend_time = datetime.strptime(end_time_str, \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %z\")\n\n# Convert end time to UTC\nend_time_utc = end_time.astimezone(tz=start_time.tzinfo)\n\n# Calculate the duration\nduration = end_time_utc - start_time\n\n# Extract days, hours, and minutes\ndays = duration.days\nhours, remainder = divmod(duration.seconds, 3600)\nminutes = remainder // 60\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"{days} days, {hours:02}:{minutes:02}\")\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the duration of the operation in the format D days, HH:MM. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code execution has provided the duration of the operation as 24 days, 17 hours, and 21 minutes. \n\nTherefore, the operation duration is:\n\n<<<24 days, 17:21>>>"
