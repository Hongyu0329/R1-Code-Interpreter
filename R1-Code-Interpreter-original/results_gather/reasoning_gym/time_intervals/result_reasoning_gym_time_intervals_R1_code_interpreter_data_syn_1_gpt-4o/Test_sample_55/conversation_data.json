    "To calculate the time difference between two timestamps, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps:\n\n1. Convert both timestamps into seconds since the start of the day.\n2. Subtract the earlier time from the later time to get the difference in seconds.\n3. Convert the difference in seconds back into the format HH:MM:SS.\n\nLet's start by converting the given times into seconds:\n\n- For 23:12:56:\n  - Hours to seconds: 23 * 3600\n  - Minutes to seconds: 12 * 60\n  - Add the seconds: 56\n\n- For 23:49:51:\n  - Hours to seconds: 23 * 3600\n  - Minutes to seconds: 49 * 60\n  - Add the seconds: 51\n\nNext, we will calculate the difference in seconds and convert it back to HH:MM:SS format.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these calculations:\n\n```python\n# Convert time to seconds\ndef time_to_seconds(hours, minutes, seconds):\n    return hours * 3600 + minutes * 60 + seconds\n\n# Convert seconds to HH:MM:SS\ndef seconds_to_time(seconds):\n    hours = seconds // 3600\n    seconds %= 3600\n    minutes = seconds // 60\n    seconds %= 60\n    return hours, minutes, seconds\n\n# Times in HH:MM:SS\ntime1 = (23, 12, 56)\ntime2 = (23, 49, 51)\n\n# Convert both times to seconds\nseconds1 = time_to_seconds(*time1)\nseconds2 = time_to_seconds(*time2)\n\n# Calculate the difference in seconds\ndifference_in_seconds = seconds2 - seconds1\n\n# Convert the difference back to HH:MM:SS\ndifference_time = seconds_to_time(difference_in_seconds)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"{difference_time[0]:02}:{difference_time[1]:02}:{difference_time[2]:02}\")\n```\n\nThis script will calculate the time difference and print it in the format HH:MM:SS.",
    "The code executed successfully and calculated the time difference between 23:12:56 and 23:49:51 as 00:36:55. \n\nThe process involved converting each time to seconds, finding the difference, and then converting the difference back to the HH:MM:SS format.\n\n<<<00:36:55>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Calculate the time difference between 23:12:56 and 23:49:51.
