    "To determine how long the database query took, we need to calculate the difference between the start time and the end time. The start time is 22:39:52, and the end time is 22:54:30. We can calculate the difference by converting these times into seconds since the start of the day, subtracting the start time from the end time, and then converting the result back into hours, minutes, and seconds.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Convert the start and end times into seconds since the start of the day.\n2. Subtract the start time in seconds from the end time in seconds to get the duration in seconds.\n3. Convert the duration in seconds back into hours, minutes, and seconds.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these calculations.\n\n```python\n# Define the start and end times\nstart_time = \"22:39:52\"\nend_time = \"22:54:30\"\n\n# Convert the start time to seconds\nstart_hours, start_minutes, start_seconds = map(int, start_time.split(':'))\nstart_total_seconds = start_hours * 3600 + start_minutes * 60 + start_seconds\n\n# Convert the end time to seconds\nend_hours, end_minutes, end_seconds = map(int, end_time.split(':'))\nend_total_seconds = end_hours * 3600 + end_minutes * 60 + end_seconds\n\n# Calculate the duration in seconds\nduration_seconds = end_total_seconds - start_total_seconds\n\n# Convert the duration back to hours, minutes, and seconds\nduration_hours = duration_seconds // 3600\nduration_seconds %= 3600\nduration_minutes = duration_seconds // 60\nduration_seconds %= 60\n\n# Print the result in HH:MM:SS format\nprint(f\"{duration_hours:02}:{duration_minutes:02}:{duration_seconds:02}\")\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the duration of the query.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output indicates that the database query took 14 minutes and 38 seconds. \n\nTherefore, the duration of the query in HH:MM:SS format is:\n\n<<<00:14:38>>>"
