    "To determine the duration of the flight, we need to calculate the difference between the departure time and the arrival time. The departure time is 18:11, and the arrival time is 19:39. \n\nTo find the duration, we can follow these steps:\n1. Convert both times into minutes since midnight.\n2. Subtract the departure time in minutes from the arrival time in minutes to get the duration in minutes.\n3. Convert the duration from minutes back into hours and minutes.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Convert time to minutes since midnight\ndef time_to_minutes(hours, minutes):\n    return hours * 60 + minutes\n\n# Convert minutes back to hours and minutes\ndef minutes_to_time(minutes):\n    hours = minutes // 60\n    minutes = minutes % 60\n    return hours, minutes\n\n# Departure and arrival times\ndeparture_time = (18, 11)  # 18:11\narrival_time = (19, 39)    # 19:39\n\n# Convert times to minutes\ndeparture_minutes = time_to_minutes(*departure_time)\narrival_minutes = time_to_minutes(*arrival_time)\n\n# Calculate duration in minutes\nduration_minutes = arrival_minutes - departure_minutes\n\n# Convert duration back to hours and minutes\nduration_hours, duration_minutes = minutes_to_time(duration_minutes)\n\n# Print the result in HH:MM format\nprint(f\"{duration_hours:02}:{duration_minutes:02}\")\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the duration of the flight.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output indicates that the flight duration is 1 hour and 28 minutes. \n\nTherefore, the duration of the flight is:\n\n<<<01:28>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    A flight departed at 18:11 and arrived at 19:39.
