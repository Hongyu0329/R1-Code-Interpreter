    "To determine the operation duration, we need to calculate the time difference between the start and end times, taking into account the different time zones.\n\n1. **Convert the start and end times to a common time zone**: The start time is in +0300 (3 hours ahead of UTC), and the end time is in -0500 (5 hours behind UTC). We can convert both times to UTC for easier calculation.\n\n2. **Calculate the time difference**: Once both times are in UTC, we can subtract the start time from the end time to get the duration.\n\n3. **Format the duration**: Convert the duration into the format D days, HH:MM:SS.\n\nLet's perform these steps using Python code.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Define the start and end times with their respective time zones\nstart_time_str = \"1912-07-14 20:07:47 +0300\"\nend_time_str = \"1912-07-31 13:37:56 -0500\"\n\n# Convert the time strings to datetime objects\nstart_time = datetime.strptime(start_time_str, \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %z\")\nend_time = datetime.strptime(end_time_str, \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %z\")\n\n# Convert both times to UTC\nstart_time_utc = start_time.astimezone(tz=None)\nend_time_utc = end_time.astimezone(tz=None)\n\n# Calculate the duration\nduration = end_time_utc - start_time_utc\n\n# Extract days, hours, minutes, and seconds from the duration\ndays = duration.days\nhours, remainder = divmod(duration.seconds, 3600)\nminutes, seconds = divmod(remainder, 60)\n\n# Format the duration\nformatted_duration = f\"{days} days, {hours:02}:{minutes:02}:{seconds:02}\"\n\nprint(formatted_duration)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the duration of the operation and format it in the required format. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output indicates that the operation duration is 17 days, 01:30:09. This means the operation took 17 days, 1 hour, 30 minutes, and 9 seconds.\n\n<<<17 days, 01:30:09>>>"
