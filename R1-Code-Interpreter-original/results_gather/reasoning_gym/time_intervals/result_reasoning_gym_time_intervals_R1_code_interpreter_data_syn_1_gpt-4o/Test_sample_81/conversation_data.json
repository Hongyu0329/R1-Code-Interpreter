    "To find the duration between two times, we need to calculate the difference between the start time and the end time. The start time is 20:55, and the end time is 22:10. \n\n1. Convert both times to minutes since the start of the day (00:00).\n2. Subtract the start time in minutes from the end time in minutes to get the duration in minutes.\n3. Convert the duration from minutes back to hours and minutes.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Convert time to minutes since the start of the day\nstart_time = 20 * 60 + 55  # 20:55\nend_time = 22 * 60 + 10    # 22:10\n\n# Calculate the duration in minutes\nduration_minutes = end_time - start_time\n\n# Convert the duration back to hours and minutes\nhours = duration_minutes // 60\nminutes = duration_minutes % 60\n\n# Print the result in HH:MM format\nprint(f\"{hours:02}:{minutes:02}\")\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the duration.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is \"01:15\". This means the duration between 20:55 and 22:10 is 1 hour and 15 minutes.\n\n<<<01:15>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    What is the duration between 20:55 and 22:10?
