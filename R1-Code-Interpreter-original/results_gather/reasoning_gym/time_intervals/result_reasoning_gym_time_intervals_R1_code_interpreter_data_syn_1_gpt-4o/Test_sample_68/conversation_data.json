    "To determine the duration of the flight, we need to calculate the difference between the departure time and the arrival time. The departure time is 14:29:49, and the arrival time is 17:40:42. We can calculate the difference by converting these times into seconds since the start of the day, finding the difference, and then converting back to hours, minutes, and seconds.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Convert the departure and arrival times into total seconds from the start of the day.\n2. Calculate the difference in seconds between the arrival and departure times.\n3. Convert the difference in seconds back into hours, minutes, and seconds.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the exact duration of the flight.\n\n```python\n# Define the departure and arrival times\ndeparture_time = (14, 29, 49)  # (hours, minutes, seconds)\narrival_time = (17, 40, 42)    # (hours, minutes, seconds)\n\n# Convert times to total seconds from the start of the day\ndeparture_seconds = departure_time[0] * 3600 + departure_time[1] * 60 + departure_time[2]\narrival_seconds = arrival_time[0] * 3600 + arrival_time[1] * 60 + arrival_time[2]\n\n# Calculate the difference in seconds\nduration_seconds = arrival_seconds - departure_seconds\n\n# Convert the duration back to hours, minutes, and seconds\nhours = duration_seconds // 3600\nminutes = (duration_seconds % 3600) // 60\nseconds = duration_seconds % 60\n\n# Print the result in HH:MM:SS format\nprint(f\"{hours:02}:{minutes:02}:{seconds:02}\")\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the duration of the flight.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output indicates that the flight duration is 3 hours, 10 minutes, and 53 seconds. \n\nTherefore, the duration of the flight is:\n\n<<<03:10:53>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    A flight departed at 14:29:49 and arrived at 17:40:42.
