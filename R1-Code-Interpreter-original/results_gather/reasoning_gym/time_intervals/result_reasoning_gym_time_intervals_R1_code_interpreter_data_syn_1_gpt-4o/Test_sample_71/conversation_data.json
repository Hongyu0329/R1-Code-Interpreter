    "To determine the duration of the video call, we need to calculate the difference between the start and end times, taking into account the time zone differences.\n\n1. **Convert the start and end times to a common time zone**: The start time is in +0800, and the end time is in +0000. We will convert both times to UTC (+0000) for simplicity.\n\n2. **Calculate the time difference**: Once both times are in the same time zone, we can subtract the start time from the end time to find the duration.\n\n3. **Format the duration**: Convert the duration from a total number of minutes or seconds into the format D days, HH:MM.\n\nLet's proceed with the calculations using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Define the start and end times with their respective time zones\nstart_time_str = \"23 February 2889, 02:58 +0800\"\nend_time_str = \"28 May 2889, 07:24 +0000\"\n\n# Convert the start and end times to datetime objects\nstart_time = datetime.strptime(start_time_str, \"%d %B %Y, %H:%M %z\")\nend_time = datetime.strptime(end_time_str, \"%d %B %Y, %H:%M %z\")\n\n# Calculate the duration\nduration = end_time - start_time\n\n# Extract days, hours, and minutes from the duration\ndays = duration.days\nhours, remainder = divmod(duration.seconds, 3600)\nminutes = remainder // 60\n\n# Print the result in the desired format\nprint(f\"{days} days, {hours:02}:{minutes:02}\")\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the duration of the call and format it in the required format. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output, which indicates that the video call lasted for 94 days, 12 hours, and 26 minutes. \n\nThe process involved converting the start and end times to a common time zone (UTC), calculating the difference, and formatting the result in the desired format.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<94 days, 12:26>>>"
