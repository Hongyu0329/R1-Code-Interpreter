    "To determine the duration of the video call, we need to calculate the difference between the start and end timestamps. The start time is given as \"2358-04-20 03:51:19 -0100\" and the end time is \"2358-05-13 11:44:31 -0900\". \n\nThe steps to solve this are as follows:\n\n1. Convert both timestamps to a common timezone, preferably UTC, to avoid any confusion with time zone differences.\n2. Calculate the difference between the two timestamps.\n3. Convert the difference into the format of D days, HH:MM.\n\nLet's proceed with the calculation using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\nimport pytz\n\n# Define the start and end times with their respective time zones\nstart_time_str = \"2358-04-20 03:51:19 -0100\"\nend_time_str = \"2358-05-13 11:44:31 -0900\"\n\n# Parse the datetime strings into datetime objects\nstart_time = datetime.strptime(start_time_str, \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %z\")\nend_time = datetime.strptime(end_time_str, \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %z\")\n\n# Convert both times to UTC\nstart_time_utc = start_time.astimezone(pytz.utc)\nend_time_utc = end_time.astimezone(pytz.utc)\n\n# Calculate the difference\nduration = end_time_utc - start_time_utc\n\n# Extract days, hours, and minutes\ndays = duration.days\nhours, remainder = divmod(duration.seconds, 3600)\nminutes = remainder // 60\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"{days} days, {hours:02}:{minutes:02}\")\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the duration of the call in the desired format. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code execution has provided the duration of the call as 23 days, 15 hours, and 53 minutes. This result is derived from calculating the difference between the two timestamps after converting them to a common timezone (UTC).\n\nTherefore, the duration of the video call is:\n\n<<<23 days, 15:53>>>"
