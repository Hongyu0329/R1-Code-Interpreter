    "To determine the duration of the meeting, we need to calculate the difference between the start time and the end time. The start time is 12:02, and the end time is 22:43. We can break this down into hours and minutes to make the calculation easier.\n\n1. **Calculate the difference in hours**: \n   - The meeting started at 12:02 PM and ended at 10:43 PM.\n   - From 12:02 PM to 10:43 PM is essentially from 12:02 to 22:43 in a 24-hour format.\n   - The difference in hours is from 12 to 22, which is 10 hours.\n\n2. **Calculate the difference in minutes**:\n   - The start minute is 02, and the end minute is 43.\n   - The difference in minutes is 43 - 02 = 41 minutes.\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to calculate this difference and print the result in HH:MM format.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# Define start and end times\nstart_time = datetime.strptime(\"12:02\", \"%H:%M\")\nend_time = datetime.strptime(\"22:43\", \"%H:%M\")\n\n# Calculate the difference\nduration = end_time - start_time\n\n# Extract hours and minutes from the duration\nhours, remainder = divmod(duration.seconds, 3600)\nminutes = remainder // 60\n\n# Print the result in HH:MM format\nprint(f\"{hours:02}:{minutes:02}\")\n```\n\nThis script will calculate the duration of the meeting and print it in the required format.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output \"10:41\" represents the duration of the meeting in hours and minutes. The meeting lasted for 10 hours and 41 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<10:41>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    A meeting started at 12:02 and ended at 22:43.
