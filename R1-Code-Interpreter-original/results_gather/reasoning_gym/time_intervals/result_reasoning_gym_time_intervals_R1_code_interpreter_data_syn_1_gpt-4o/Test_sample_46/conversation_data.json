    "To determine the duration of the flight, we need to calculate the difference between the departure time and the arrival time. The departure time is 03:19:59, and the arrival time is 12:42:10. \n\nThe process involves:\n1. Converting both times into seconds since the start of the day.\n2. Calculating the difference in seconds.\n3. Converting the difference back into hours, minutes, and seconds.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Convert time to seconds since the start of the day\ndef time_to_seconds(hours, minutes, seconds):\n    return hours * 3600 + minutes * 60 + seconds\n\n# Convert seconds back to HH:MM:SS format\ndef seconds_to_hhmmss(total_seconds):\n    hours = total_seconds // 3600\n    minutes = (total_seconds % 3600) // 60\n    seconds = total_seconds % 60\n    return f\"{hours:02}:{minutes:02}:{seconds:02}\"\n\n# Departure and arrival times\ndeparture_time = (3, 19, 59)  # 03:19:59\narrival_time = (12, 42, 10)   # 12:42:10\n\n# Convert both times to seconds\ndeparture_seconds = time_to_seconds(*departure_time)\narrival_seconds = time_to_seconds(*arrival_time)\n\n# Calculate the duration in seconds\nduration_seconds = arrival_seconds - departure_seconds\n\n# Convert the duration back to HH:MM:SS\nflight_duration = seconds_to_hhmmss(duration_seconds)\n\nprint(flight_duration)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the duration of the flight in the format HH:MM:SS. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output indicates that the flight duration is 9 hours, 22 minutes, and 11 seconds. \n\nTherefore, the duration of the flight is:\n\n<<<09:22:11>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    A flight departed at 03:19:59 and arrived at 12:42:10.
