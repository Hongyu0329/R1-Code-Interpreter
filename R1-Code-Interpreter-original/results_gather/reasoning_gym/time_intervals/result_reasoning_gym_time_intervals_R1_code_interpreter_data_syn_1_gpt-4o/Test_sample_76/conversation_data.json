    "To determine the duration of the flight, we need to calculate the difference between the departure time and the arrival time. The departure time is 22:52:05, and the arrival time is 23:52:12. \n\nThe steps to calculate the duration are as follows:\n\n1. Convert both times into seconds since the start of the day.\n2. Subtract the departure time in seconds from the arrival time in seconds to get the duration in seconds.\n3. Convert the duration from seconds back into hours, minutes, and seconds.\n\nLet's perform these calculations using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Convert time to seconds since the start of the day\ndef time_to_seconds(hours, minutes, seconds):\n    return hours * 3600 + minutes * 60 + seconds\n\n# Departure and arrival times\ndeparture_time = (22, 52, 5)\narrival_time = (23, 52, 12)\n\n# Convert both times to seconds\ndeparture_seconds = time_to_seconds(*departure_time)\narrival_seconds = time_to_seconds(*arrival_time)\n\n# Calculate the duration in seconds\nduration_seconds = arrival_seconds - departure_seconds\n\n# Convert the duration back to hours, minutes, and seconds\nhours = duration_seconds // 3600\nminutes = (duration_seconds % 3600) // 60\nseconds = duration_seconds % 60\n\n# Print the result in HH:MM:SS format\nprint(f\"{hours:02}:{minutes:02}:{seconds:02}\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the duration of the flight.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output indicates that the flight duration is 1 hour, 0 minutes, and 7 seconds. \n\nTherefore, the duration of the flight is:\n\n<<<01:00:07>>>"
