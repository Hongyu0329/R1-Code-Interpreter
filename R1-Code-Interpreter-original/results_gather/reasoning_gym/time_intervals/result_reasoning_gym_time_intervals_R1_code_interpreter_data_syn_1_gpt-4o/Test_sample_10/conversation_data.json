    "To determine the total backup duration, we need to calculate the difference between the start and end timestamps. The start time is \"2964-06-17 08:15:14\" and the end time is \"2964-07-04 11:59:09\". \n\nThe steps involved are:\n1. Parse the start and end timestamps into a datetime format.\n2. Calculate the difference between the two datetime objects.\n3. Convert the difference into the format \"D days, HH:MM\".\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these calculations.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# Define the start and end timestamps\nstart_time = \"2964-06-17 08:15:14\"\nend_time = \"2964-07-04 11:59:09\"\n\n# Parse the timestamps into datetime objects\nstart_dt = datetime.strptime(start_time, \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\nend_dt = datetime.strptime(end_time, \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n\n# Calculate the difference\nduration = end_dt - start_dt\n\n# Extract days, hours, and minutes\ndays = duration.days\nhours, remainder = divmod(duration.seconds, 3600)\nminutes, _ = divmod(remainder, 60)\n\n# Print the result in the desired format\nprint(f\"{days} days, {hours:02}:{minutes:02}\")\n```\n\nThis script will calculate the duration between the two timestamps and print it in the format \"D days, HH:MM\". Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output \"17 days, 03:43\". This means the total backup duration from the start time \"2964-06-17 08:15:14\" to the end time \"2964-07-04 11:59:09\" is 17 days, 3 hours, and 43 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<17 days, 03:43>>>"
