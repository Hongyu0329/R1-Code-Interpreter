    "To determine the duration of the flight, we need to calculate the difference between the departure and arrival times, taking into account the time zone differences.\n\n1. **Departure Time**: 2302-01-23 09:27 -0100\n2. **Arrival Time**: 2302-01-26 03:36 -0300\n\nThe departure time is in the -0100 time zone, and the arrival time is in the -0300 time zone. To accurately calculate the duration, we should convert both times to a common time zone, such as UTC.\n\n- **Departure in UTC**: The departure time is 2302-01-23 09:27 -0100, which means it is 1 hour behind UTC. Therefore, in UTC, it is 2302-01-23 10:27.\n- **Arrival in UTC**: The arrival time is 2302-01-26 03:36 -0300, which means it is 3 hours behind UTC. Therefore, in UTC, it is 2302-01-26 06:36.\n\nNow, we can calculate the difference between these two UTC times to find the flight duration.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this calculation:\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# Define the departure and arrival times in UTC\ndeparture_utc = datetime.strptime(\"2302-01-23 10:27\", \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M\")\narrival_utc = datetime.strptime(\"2302-01-26 06:36\", \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M\")\n\n# Calculate the duration\nduration = arrival_utc - departure_utc\n\n# Extract days, hours, and minutes\ndays = duration.days\nhours, remainder = divmod(duration.seconds, 3600)\nminutes = remainder // 60\n\n# Print the result in the format D days, HH:MM\nprint(f\"{days} days, {hours:02}:{minutes:02}\")\n```\n\nThis script will calculate the duration of the flight in the desired format. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output indicates that the flight duration is 2 days, 20 hours, and 9 minutes. \n\nTherefore, the final answer to the question is:\n\n<<<2 days, 20:09>>>"
