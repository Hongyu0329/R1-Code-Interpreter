# Define the number of days in each month
days_in_march = 31
days_in_april = 30
days_in_may = 31

# Calculate the days remaining in March from the 14th
days_remaining_march = days_in_march - 14 + 1

# Calculate the total days from March 14 to May 29
total_days = days_remaining_march + days_in_april + 29
