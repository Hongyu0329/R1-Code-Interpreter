    "To determine the duration of the flight, we need to calculate the difference between the departure time and the arrival time. The departure time is 19:37:49, and the arrival time is 22:56:23. \n\nThe steps to calculate the duration are as follows:\n\n1. Convert both times into seconds since the start of the day.\n2. Subtract the departure time in seconds from the arrival time in seconds to get the duration in seconds.\n3. Convert the duration from seconds back into hours, minutes, and seconds.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the exact duration.\n\n```python\n# Convert time to seconds since the start of the day\ndef time_to_seconds(hours, minutes, seconds):\n    return hours * 3600 + minutes * 60 + seconds\n\n# Convert seconds back to HH:MM:SS\ndef seconds_to_hhmmss(total_seconds):\n    hours = total_seconds // 3600\n    minutes = (total_seconds % 3600) // 60\n    seconds = total_seconds % 60\n    return hours, minutes, seconds\n\n# Departure and arrival times\ndeparture_time = (19, 37, 49)\narrival_time = (22, 56, 23)\n\n# Convert times to seconds\ndeparture_seconds = time_to_seconds(*departure_time)\narrival_seconds = time_to_seconds(*arrival_time)\n\n# Calculate duration in seconds\nduration_seconds = arrival_seconds - departure_seconds\n\n# Convert duration back to HH:MM:SS\nduration_hhmmss = seconds_to_hhmmss(duration_seconds)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"{duration_hhmmss[0]:02}:{duration_hhmmss[1]:02}:{duration_hhmmss[2]:02}\")\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the duration of the flight.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output indicates that the flight duration is 3 hours, 18 minutes, and 34 seconds. \n\nTherefore, the duration of the flight is:\n\n<<<03:18:34>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
