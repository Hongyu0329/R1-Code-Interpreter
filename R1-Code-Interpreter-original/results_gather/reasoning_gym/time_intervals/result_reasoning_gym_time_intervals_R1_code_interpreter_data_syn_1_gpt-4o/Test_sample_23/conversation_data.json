    "To calculate the time difference between 06:09 and 11:40, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert both times into minutes since midnight.\n2. Subtract the earlier time from the later time to find the difference in minutes.\n3. Convert the difference back into hours and minutes.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- 06:09 is 6 hours and 9 minutes past midnight. In minutes, this is \\(6 \\times 60 + 9 = 369\\) minutes.\n- 11:40 is 11 hours and 40 minutes past midnight. In minutes, this is \\(11 \\times 60 + 40 = 700\\) minutes.\n\nNow, we find the difference:\n\n- Difference in minutes = 700 - 369 = 331 minutes.\n\nFinally, we convert 331 minutes back into hours and minutes:\n\n- Hours = 331 // 60\n- Minutes = 331 % 60\n\nLet's calculate this using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Convert times to minutes since midnight\ntime1_minutes = 6 * 60 + 9\ntime2_minutes = 11 * 60 + 40\n\n# Calculate the difference in minutes\ndifference_minutes = time2_minutes - time1_minutes\n\n# Convert the difference back to hours and minutes\nhours = difference_minutes // 60\nminutes = difference_minutes % 60\n\n# Print the result in HH:MM format\nprint(f\"{hours:02}:{minutes:02}\")\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the time difference.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is \"05:31\". This means the time difference between 06:09 and 11:40 is 5 hours and 31 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<05:31>>>"
