    "To determine the duration of the flight, we need to calculate the difference between the departure and arrival times. The departure time is Tue May 30 2699 22:34:19, and the arrival time is Thu Aug 03 2699 05:35:19. \n\nThe steps to solve this are as follows:\n1. Convert both the departure and arrival times into a datetime format.\n2. Calculate the difference between the two datetime objects.\n3. Extract the number of days, hours, and minutes from the resulting timedelta object.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these calculations.\n\n```python\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n# Define the departure and arrival times\ndeparture_time = \"Tue May 30 2699 22:34:19\"\narrival_time = \"Thu Aug 03 2699 05:35:19\"\n\n# Convert the strings to datetime objects\ndeparture_dt = datetime.strptime(departure_time, \"%a %b %d %Y %H:%M:%S\")\narrival_dt = datetime.strptime(arrival_time, \"%a %b %d %Y %H:%M:%S\")\n\n# Calculate the difference\nflight_duration = arrival_dt - departure_dt\n\n# Extract days, hours, and minutes\ndays = flight_duration.days\nhours, remainder = divmod(flight_duration.seconds, 3600)\nminutes = remainder // 60\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"{days} days, {hours:02}:{minutes:02}\")\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the flight duration.",
    "The code execution has provided the flight duration as 64 days, 07:01. This means the flight lasted for 64 days, 7 hours, and 1 minute. \n\nNow, I will present the final answer.\n\n<<<64 days, 07:01>>>"
