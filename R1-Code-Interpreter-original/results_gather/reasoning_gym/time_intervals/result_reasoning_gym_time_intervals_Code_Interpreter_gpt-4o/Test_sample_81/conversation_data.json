    "\nassistant > To find the duration between 20:55 and 22:10, we can perform the following calculation:\n\n1. Start time: 20:55\n2. End time: 22:10\n\nFirst, calculate the difference in hours and minutes separately:\n\n- Hours: 22 - 20 = 2 hours\n- Minutes: 10 - 55 = -45 minutes\n\nSince the minutes are negative, we need to adjust by borrowing 1 hour (60 minutes) from the hours:\n\n- Adjusted hours: 2 - 1 = 1 hour\n- Adjusted minutes: 60 + 10 - 55 = 15 minutes\n\nTherefore, the duration is 1 hour and 15 minutes.\n\nThe duration between 20:55 and 22:10 is <<<01:15>>>."
