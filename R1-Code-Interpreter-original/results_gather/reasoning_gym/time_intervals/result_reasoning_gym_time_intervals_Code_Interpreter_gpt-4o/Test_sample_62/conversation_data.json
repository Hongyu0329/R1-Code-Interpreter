    "\nassistant > To calculate the duration of the flight, we need to consider the time zones and the difference between the departure and arrival times.\n\n1. **Departure Time**: 2302-01-23 09:27 -0100\n2. **Arrival Time**: 2302-01-26 03:36 -0300\n\nFirst, we will convert both times to a common time zone (UTC) and then calculate the difference.\n\n- Departure time in UTC: 2302-01-23 09:27 -0100 is equivalent to 2302-01-23 10:27 UTC.\n- Arrival time in UTC: 2302-01-26 03:36 -0300 is equivalent to 2302-01-26 06:36 UTC.\n\nNow, let's calculate the difference between these two times.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\n\n# Define the departure and arrival times in UTC\ndeparture_utc = datetime.strptime(\"2302-01-23 10:27\", \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M\")\narrival_utc = datetime.strptime(\"2302-01-26 06:36\", \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M\")\n\n# Calculate the duration of the flight\nflight_duration = arrival_utc - departure_utc\n\n# Convert the duration to days, hours, and minutes\ndays = flight_duration.days\nhours, remainder = divmod(flight_duration.seconds, 3600)\nminutes = remainder // 60\n\ndays, hours, minutes\nassistant > The flight duration is 2 days, 20 hours, and 9 minutes. Therefore, the flight lasted:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<2 days, 20:09>>>}\n\\]"
