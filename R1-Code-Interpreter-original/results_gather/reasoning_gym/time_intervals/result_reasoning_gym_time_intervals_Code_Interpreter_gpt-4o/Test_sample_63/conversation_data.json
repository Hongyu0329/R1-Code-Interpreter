    "\nassistant > To calculate the operation duration, we need to consider the time zones and the time difference between the start and end times.\n\n1. **Start Time:** 2609-01-28 00:08:51 -1000\n2. **End Time:** 2609-01-29 22:02:04 +0800\n\nThe start time is in the -1000 time zone (10 hours behind UTC), and the end time is in the +0800 time zone (8 hours ahead of UTC). \n\nFirst, we will convert both times to UTC, then calculate the difference between them.
