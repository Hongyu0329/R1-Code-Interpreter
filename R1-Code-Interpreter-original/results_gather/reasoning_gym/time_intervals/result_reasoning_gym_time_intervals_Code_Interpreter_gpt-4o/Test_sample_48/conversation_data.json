    "\nassistant > To find the total backup duration, we need to calculate the difference between the start and end times. Let's break down the times:\n\n- Start time: 12:34:57.377\n- End time: 20:14:35.750\n\nWe will convert these times into a format that allows us to easily calculate the difference, and then convert the result back into the desired format.
