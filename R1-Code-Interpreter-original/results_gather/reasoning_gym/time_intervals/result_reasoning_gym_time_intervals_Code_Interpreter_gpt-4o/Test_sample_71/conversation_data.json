    "\nassistant > To determine the duration of the video call, we need to calculate the difference between the start and end times, taking into account the time zone differences.\n\n- Start time: 23 February 2889, 02:58 +0800\n- End time: 28 May 2889, 07:24 +0000\n\nFirst, we will convert both times to the same time zone (UTC) and then calculate the difference. Let's proceed with the calculations.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\nimport pytz\n\n# Define the start and end times with their respective time zones\nstart_time_str = \"23 February 2889, 02:58 +0800\"\nend_time_str = \"28 May 2889, 07:24 +0000\"\n\n# Define the format of the input strings\ntime_format = \"%d %B %Y, %H:%M %z\"\n\n# Parse the start and end times\nstart_time = datetime.strptime(start_time_str, time_format)\nend_time = datetime.strptime(end_time_str, time_format)\n\n# Convert both times to UTC\nstart_time_utc = start_time.astimezone(pytz.utc)\nend_time_utc = end_time.astimezone(pytz.utc)\n\n# Calculate the difference\nduration = end_time_utc - start_time_utc\n\n# Extract days, hours, and minutes\ndays = duration.days\nhours, remainder = divmod(duration.seconds, 3600)\nminutes = remainder // 60\n\ndays, hours, minutes\nassistant > The duration of the video call was 94 days, 12 hours, and 26 minutes. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<94 days, 12:26>>>"
