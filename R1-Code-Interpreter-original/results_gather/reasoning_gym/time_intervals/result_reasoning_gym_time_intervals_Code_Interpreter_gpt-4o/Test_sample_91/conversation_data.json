The result of subtracting two `datetime` objects is a `timedelta` object, which doesn't have a `strftime` method. Instead, I'll manually extract the hours and minutes from the `timedelta` object. Let me correct that.# Extract hours and minutes from the timedelta object\nhours, remainder = divmod(duration.seconds, 3600)\nminutes = remainder // 60\n\n# Format the duration as HH:MM\nduration_str = f\"{hours:02}:{minutes:02}\"\nduration_str\nassistant > The operation duration was <<<07:25>>>."
