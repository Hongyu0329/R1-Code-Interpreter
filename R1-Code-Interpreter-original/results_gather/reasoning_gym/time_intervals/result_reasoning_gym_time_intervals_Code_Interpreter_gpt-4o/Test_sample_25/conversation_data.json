    "\nassistant > To find the duration of the meeting, we need to calculate the difference between the start time and the end time.\n\nThe meeting started at 11:37 and ended at 11:58.\n\n1. Start time: 11:37\n2. End time: 11:58\n\nTo find the duration, we subtract the start time from the end time:\n\n- Minutes: 58 - 37 = 21 minutes\n- Hours: 11 - 11 = 0 hours\n\nSo, the duration of the meeting is 0 hours and 21 minutes.\n\nThe answer in HH:MM format is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Duration} = 00:21\n\\]\n\nThus, the duration of the meeting is <<<00:21>>>."
