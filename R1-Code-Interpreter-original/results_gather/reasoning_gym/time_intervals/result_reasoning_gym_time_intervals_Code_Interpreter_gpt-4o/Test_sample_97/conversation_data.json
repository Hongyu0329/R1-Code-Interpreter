    "\nassistant > To calculate the total backup duration, we need to consider the start and end times, including their respective time zones. The start time is in the -0500 time zone, and the end time is in the -0900 time zone. We will first convert both times to a common time zone (UTC) and then calculate the difference.\n\n1.
