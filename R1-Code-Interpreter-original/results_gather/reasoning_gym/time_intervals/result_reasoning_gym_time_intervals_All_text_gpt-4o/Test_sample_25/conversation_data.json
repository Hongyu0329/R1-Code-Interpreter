    "To determine the duration of the meeting, we need to calculate the difference between the start time and the end time. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Times:**\n   - Start Time: 11:37\n   - End Time: 11:58\n\n2. **Calculate the Difference in Minutes:**\n   - Since both times are within the same hour (11 o'clock), we can directly subtract the minutes.\n   - End Minutes: 58\n   - Start Minutes: 37\n   - Difference in Minutes = End Minutes - Start Minutes = 58 - 37 = 21 minutes\n\n3. **Convert the Difference into HH:MM Format:**\n   - Since the difference is less than an hour, the hours part is 0.\n   - Therefore, the duration of the meeting is 0 hours and 21 minutes.\n\n4. **Format the Answer:**\n   - In HH:MM format, this is represented as 00:21.\n\nBy following these steps, we have determined the duration of the meeting.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<00:21>>>."
