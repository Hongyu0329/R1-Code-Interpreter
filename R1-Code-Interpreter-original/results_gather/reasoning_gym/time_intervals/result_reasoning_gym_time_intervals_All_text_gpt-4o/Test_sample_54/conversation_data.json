    "To calculate the time difference between 17:53 and 17:59 and express it in HH:MM format, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Times:**\n   - Start time: 17:53\n   - End time: 17:59\n\n2. **Understand the Time Format:**\n   - Both times are given in a 24-hour format (HH:MM).\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference in Minutes:**\n   - Since both times are within the same hour (17:00), we only need to calculate the difference in minutes.\n   - Subtract the start time minutes from the end time minutes: \n     - 59 (end minutes) - 53 (start minutes) = 6 minutes\n\n4. **Express the Result in HH:MM Format:**\n   - Since the difference is less than an hour, the hours part will be 00.\n   - The minutes part is 06.\n   - Therefore, the time difference is 00:06.\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   - The time difference between 17:53 and 17:59 is 00:06.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<00:06>>>"
