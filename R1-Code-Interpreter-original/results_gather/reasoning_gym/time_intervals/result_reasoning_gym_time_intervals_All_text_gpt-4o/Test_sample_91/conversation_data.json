    "To determine the duration of the system operation, we need to calculate the time difference between the start time and the end time. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Times:**\n   - Start Time: 08:05\n   - End Time: 15:30\n\n2. **Convert Times to a 24-hour Format:**\n   - Both times are already in 24-hour format, so no conversion is necessary.\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference in Hours:**\n   - The start time is 08:05, and the end time is 15:30.\n   - To find the difference in hours, subtract the hour of the start time from the hour of the end time:\n     - 15 (end hour) - 08 (start hour) = 7 hours\n\n4. **Calculate the Difference in Minutes:**\n   - The start time is 08:05, and the end time is 15:30.\n   - To find the difference in minutes, subtract the minutes of the start time from the minutes of the end time:\n     - 30 (end minutes) - 05 (start minutes) = 25 minutes\n\n5. **Combine the Differences:**\n   - The total duration is the combination of the hours and minutes calculated:\n   - 7 hours and 25 minutes\n\n6. **Format the Duration:**\n   - The duration should be formatted in HH:MM format.\n   - Therefore, the operation duration is 07:25.\n\nBy following these steps, we have determined the duration of the system operation.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<07:25>>>."
