    "To determine the duration of the flight, we need to carefully analyze the given departure and arrival times, taking into account the time zones and any potential date changes. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Time Zones:**\n   - The departure time is given as \"2302-01-23 09:27 -0100\". This means the flight departed on January 23, 2302, at 09:27 AM in a time zone that is 1 hour behind UTC.\n   - The arrival time is given as \"2302-01-26 03:36 -0300\". This means the flight arrived on January 26, 2302, at 03:36 AM in a time zone that is 3 hours behind UTC.\n\n2. **Convert Both Times to UTC:**\n   - Departure in UTC: \n     - The departure time is \"2302-01-23 09:27 -0100\". To convert this to UTC, we add 1 hour (since the time zone is 1 hour behind UTC).\n     - UTC departure time: \"2302-01-23 10:27\".\n   - Arrival in UTC:\n     - The arrival time is \"2302-01-26 03:36 -0300\". To convert this to UTC, we add 3 hours (since the time zone is 3 hours behind UTC).\n     - UTC arrival time: \"2302-01-26 06:36\".\n\n3. **Calculate the Duration:**\n   - Now that both times are in UTC, we can calculate the duration of the flight.\n   - Start time (UTC): \"2302-01-23 10:27\"\n   - End time (UTC): \"2302-01-26 06:36\"\n   - Calculate the difference:\n     - From \"2302-01-23 10:27\" to \"2302-01-24 10:27\" is exactly 1 day.\n     - From \"2302-01-24 10:27\" to \"2302-01-25 10:27\" is another day, totaling 2 days.\n     - From \"2302-01-25 10:27\" to \"2302-01-26 06:27\" is 20 hours.\n     - From \"2302-01-26 06:27\" to \"2302-01-26 06:36\" is 9 minutes.\n\n4. **Summarize the Duration:**\n   - Total duration: 2 days, 20 hours, and 9 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the duration of the flight is:\n\n<<<2 days, 20:09>>>"
