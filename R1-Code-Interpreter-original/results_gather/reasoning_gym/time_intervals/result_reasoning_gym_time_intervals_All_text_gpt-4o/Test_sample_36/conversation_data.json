    "To determine the duration of the database query, we need to carefully analyze the start and end times, taking into account the time zones and the differences in dates and times. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Times:**\n   - Start: 24 November 2770, 18:15 +1100\n   - End: 24 January 2771, 03:55 +0900\n\n2. **Convert Both Times to a Common Time Zone:**\n   - The start time is in the +1100 time zone, which means it is 11 hours ahead of UTC.\n   - The end time is in the +0900 time zone, which means it is 9 hours ahead of UTC.\n\n3. **Convert Start Time to UTC:**\n   - Start time in UTC: 24 November 2770, 18:15 - 11 hours = 24 November 2770, 07:15 UTC\n\n4. **Convert End Time to UTC:**\n   - End time in UTC: 24 January 2771, 03:55 - 9 hours = 23 January 2771, 18:55 UTC\n\n5. **Calculate the Duration in UTC:**\n   - Start: 24 November 2770, 07:15 UTC\n   - End: 23 January 2771, 18:55 UTC\n\n6. **Calculate the Difference in Days and Time:**\n   - From 24 November 2770 to 23 January 2771 is 60 days (since November has 30 days and December has 31 days, and we are counting from the 24th of November to the 23rd of January).\n   - Time difference on the 60th day: From 07:15 to 18:55 is 11 hours and 40 minutes.\n\n7. **Combine the Days and Time:**\n   - Total duration: 60 days, 11 hours, and 40 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the query took a total of 60 days, 11 hours, and 40 minutes.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<60 days, 11:40>>>."
