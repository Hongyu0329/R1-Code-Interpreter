    "To determine the operation duration, we need to calculate the time difference between the start and end times, taking into account the time zone differences. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Times:**\n   - Start: 1912-07-14 20:07:47 +0300\n   - End: 1912-07-31 13:37:56 -0500\n\n2. **Convert Both Times to a Common Time Zone:**\n   - The start time is in the +0300 time zone, which is 3 hours ahead of UTC.\n   - The end time is in the -0500 time zone, which is 5 hours behind UTC.\n\n3. **Convert Start Time to UTC:**\n   - Start time in UTC: 1912-07-14 20:07:47 - 3 hours = 1912-07-14 17:07:47 UTC\n\n4. **Convert End Time to UTC:**\n   - End time in UTC: 1912-07-31 13:37:56 + 5 hours = 1912-07-31 18:37:56 UTC\n\n5. **Calculate the Time Difference:**\n   - Start: 1912-07-14 17:07:47 UTC\n   - End: 1912-07-31 18:37:56 UTC\n\n6. **Calculate the Duration:**\n   - From 1912-07-14 17:07:47 to 1912-07-31 17:07:47 is exactly 17 days.\n   - From 17:07:47 to 18:37:56 is 1 hour, 30 minutes, and 9 seconds.\n\n7. **Combine the Duration:**\n   - Total duration: 17 days, 1 hour, 30 minutes, and 9 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the operation duration is:\n\n<<<17 days, 01:30:09>>>"
