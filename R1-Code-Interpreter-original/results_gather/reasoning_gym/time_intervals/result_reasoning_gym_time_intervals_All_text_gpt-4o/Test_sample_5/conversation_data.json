    "To determine the duration of the conference call, we need to calculate the difference between the start and end times. Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Date and Time:**\n   - Start: 2805-10-28 11:28:33\n   - End: 2805-11-11 04:06:34\n\n2. **Calculate the Difference in Days:**\n   - The start date is October 28, 2805, and the end date is November 11, 2805.\n   - From October 28 to November 11 is 14 days (since November 11 is the 14th day after October 28).\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference in Time:**\n   - Start time: 11:28:33\n   - End time: 04:06:34\n\n4. **Adjust for Time Difference:**\n   - Since the end time (04:06:34) is earlier in the day than the start time (11:28:33), we need to adjust by subtracting one day from the total days and calculating the time difference by considering the end time as part of the next day.\n\n5. **Calculate the Time Difference:**\n   - From 11:28:33 to 24:00:00 (midnight) is 12 hours, 31 minutes, and 27 seconds.\n   - From 00:00:00 to 04:06:34 is 4 hours, 6 minutes, and 34 seconds.\n\n6. **Add the Time Differences:**\n   - Total time from 11:28:33 to 04:06:34 (next day) is:\n     - Hours: 12 + 4 = 16 hours\n     - Minutes: 31 + 6 = 37 minutes\n     - Seconds: 27 + 34 = 61 seconds\n\n7. **Adjust for Seconds Overflow:**\n   - 61 seconds is 1 minute and 1 second, so add 1 minute to the minutes and keep 1 second.\n   - Adjusted time: 16 hours, 38 minutes, and 1 second.\n\n8. **Combine Days and Time:**\n   - Total days: 14 days - 1 day (due to time adjustment) = 13 days\n   - Total time: 16 hours, 38 minutes\n\n9. **Format the Answer:**\n   - The duration of the conference call is 13 days, 16 hours, and 38 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<13 days, 16:38>>>"
