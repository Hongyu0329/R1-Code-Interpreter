    "To determine the duration of the video call, we need to calculate the difference between the start time and the end time. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Times:**\n   - Start Time: 09:27\n   - End Time: 13:56\n\n2. **Calculate the Difference in Hours:**\n   - The start time is 09:27, which is 9 hours and 27 minutes.\n   - The end time is 13:56, which is 13 hours and 56 minutes.\n   - To find the difference in hours, subtract the start hour from the end hour: \n     \\[\n     13 - 9 = 4 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference in Minutes:**\n   - The start time has 27 minutes, and the end time has 56 minutes.\n   - To find the difference in minutes, subtract the start minutes from the end minutes:\n     \\[\n     56 - 27 = 29 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Combine the Differences:**\n   - The total duration of the call is 4 hours and 29 minutes.\n\n5. **Format the Answer:**\n   - The duration should be expressed in HH:MM format, which is 04:29.\n\nTherefore, the duration of the video call is <<<04:29>>>."
