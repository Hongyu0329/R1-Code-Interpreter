    "To determine the duration of the meeting, we need to calculate the difference between the start time and the end time. The times are given in the format HH:MM:SS.mmm, where HH is hours, MM is minutes, SS is seconds, and mmm is milliseconds.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Times:**\n   - Start Time: 07:29:28.059\n   - End Time: 17:27:12.162\n\n2. **Break Down the Times into Components:**\n   - Start Time: \n     - Hours: 07\n     - Minutes: 29\n     - Seconds: 28\n     - Milliseconds: 059\n   - End Time:\n     - Hours: 17\n     - Minutes: 27\n     - Seconds: 12\n     - Milliseconds: 162\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference in Milliseconds:**\n   - End Milliseconds: 162\n   - Start Milliseconds: 059\n   - Difference: 162 - 059 = 103 milliseconds\n\n4. **Calculate the Difference in Seconds:**\n   - End Seconds: 12\n   - Start Seconds: 28\n   - Since 12 is less than 28, we need to borrow 1 minute (60 seconds) from the minutes.\n   - Adjusted End Seconds: 12 + 60 = 72\n   - Difference: 72 - 28 = 44 seconds\n\n5. **Calculate the Difference in Minutes:**\n   - End Minutes: 27 (after borrowing 1 minute)\n   - Start Minutes: 29\n   - Since 27 is less than 29, we need to borrow 1 hour (60 minutes) from the hours.\n   - Adjusted End Minutes: 27 + 60 = 87\n   - Difference: 87 - 29 = 58 minutes\n\n6. **Calculate the Difference in Hours:**\n   - End Hours: 17 (after borrowing 1 hour)\n   - Start Hours: 07\n   - Difference: 17 - 07 = 10 hours\n\n7. **Combine the Differences:**\n   - Hours: 10\n   - Minutes: 58\n   - Seconds: 44\n   - Milliseconds: 103\n\nThe duration of the meeting is 10 hours, 58 minutes, 44 seconds, and 103 milliseconds.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<10:58:44.103>>>"
