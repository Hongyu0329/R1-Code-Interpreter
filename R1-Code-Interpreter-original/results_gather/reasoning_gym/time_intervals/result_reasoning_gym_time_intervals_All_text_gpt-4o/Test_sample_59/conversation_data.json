    "To determine the duration of the flight, we need to calculate the difference between the departure time and the arrival time. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Departure and Arrival Times:**\n   - Departure Time: 18:11\n   - Arrival Time: 19:39\n\n2. **Convert Times to a 24-hour Format:**\n   - Both times are already in 24-hour format, so no conversion is necessary.\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference in Hours and Minutes:**\n   - Start by calculating the difference in minutes and hours separately.\n\n4. **Calculate the Difference in Minutes:**\n   - Departure Minutes: 11\n   - Arrival Minutes: 39\n   - Difference in Minutes: 39 - 11 = 28 minutes\n\n5. **Calculate the Difference in Hours:**\n   - Departure Hour: 18\n   - Arrival Hour: 19\n   - Difference in Hours: 19 - 18 = 1 hour\n\n6. **Combine the Differences:**\n   - The total flight duration is 1 hour and 28 minutes.\n\n7. **Format the Answer:**\n   - The duration should be formatted in HH:MM format.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine that the flight duration is 1 hour and 28 minutes.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<01:28>>>"
