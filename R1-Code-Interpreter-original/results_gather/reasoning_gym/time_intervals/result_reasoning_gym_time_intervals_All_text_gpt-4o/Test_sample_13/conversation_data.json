    "To determine the duration between the two given times, 13:31:16.310 and 15:00:43.656, we need to perform a step-by-step subtraction of the earlier time from the later time. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Identify the components of each time:**\n   - Start time: 13:31:16.310\n     - Hours: 13\n     - Minutes: 31\n     - Seconds: 16\n     - Milliseconds: 310\n   - End time: 15:00:43.656\n     - Hours: 15\n     - Minutes: 00\n     - Seconds: 43\n     - Milliseconds: 656\n\n2. **Subtract the milliseconds:**\n   - End milliseconds: 656\n   - Start milliseconds: 310\n   - Calculation: 656 - 310 = 346 milliseconds\n\n3. **Subtract the seconds:**\n   - End seconds: 43\n   - Start seconds: 16\n   - Calculation: 43 - 16 = 27 seconds\n\n4. **Subtract the minutes:**\n   - End minutes: 00\n   - Start minutes: 31\n   - Since 00 is less than 31, we need to borrow 1 hour (60 minutes) from the hours.\n   - Adjusted end minutes: 60\n   - Calculation: 60 - 31 = 29 minutes\n\n5. **Subtract the hours:**\n   - Adjusted end hours (after borrowing 1 hour): 14 (15 - 1)\n   - Start hours: 13\n   - Calculation: 14 - 13 = 1 hour\n\n6. **Combine the results:**\n   - Hours: 1\n   - Minutes: 29\n   - Seconds: 27\n   - Milliseconds: 346\n\nTherefore, the duration between 13:31:16.310 and 15:00:43.656 is 1 hour, 29 minutes, 27 seconds, and 346 milliseconds.\n\nFinal answer: <<<01:29:27.346>>>"
