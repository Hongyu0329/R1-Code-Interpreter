    "To determine how long the database query took, we need to calculate the time difference between the start and end times. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Times:**\n   - Start Time: 11:26\n   - End Time: 13:27\n\n2. **Understand the Time Format:**\n   - The times are given in a 24-hour format.\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference in Hours:**\n   - The start time is at 11:26, and the end time is at 13:27.\n   - From 11:26 to 12:26 is 1 hour.\n   - From 12:26 to 13:26 is another hour.\n   - So, from 11:26 to 13:26 is a total of 2 hours.\n\n4. **Calculate the Difference in Minutes:**\n   - The start time is at 11:26, and the end time is at 13:27.\n   - From 13:26 to 13:27 is 1 minute.\n\n5. **Combine the Hours and Minutes:**\n   - Total time from 11:26 to 13:27 is 2 hours and 1 minute.\n\n6. **Format the Answer:**\n   - The time duration should be expressed in HH:MM format.\n   - Therefore, the duration is 02:01.\n\nBy following these steps, we have determined the duration of the query.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<02:01>>>."
