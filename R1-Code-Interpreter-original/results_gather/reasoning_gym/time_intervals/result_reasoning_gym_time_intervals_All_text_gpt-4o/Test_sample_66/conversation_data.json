    "To determine the duration of the video call, we need to calculate the difference between the start and end times. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Times:**\n   - Start Time: 18:53:02.428\n   - End Time: 22:05:29.488\n\n2. **Break Down the Times into Components:**\n   - Start Time: 18 hours, 53 minutes, 02 seconds, and 428 milliseconds.\n   - End Time: 22 hours, 05 minutes, 29 seconds, and 488 milliseconds.\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference in Each Component:**\n\n   - **Milliseconds:**\n     - End: 488 milliseconds\n     - Start: 428 milliseconds\n     - Difference: 488 - 428 = 60 milliseconds\n\n   - **Seconds:**\n     - End: 29 seconds\n     - Start: 02 seconds\n     - Difference: 29 - 02 = 27 seconds\n\n   - **Minutes:**\n     - End: 05 minutes\n     - Start: 53 minutes\n     - Since 05 is less than 53, we need to borrow 1 hour (60 minutes) from the hours component.\n     - Adjusted End Minutes: 05 + 60 = 65 minutes\n     - Difference: 65 - 53 = 12 minutes\n\n   - **Hours:**\n     - End: 22 hours\n     - Start: 18 hours\n     - We borrowed 1 hour for the minutes calculation, so we need to subtract 1 from the end hours.\n     - Adjusted End Hours: 22 - 1 = 21 hours\n     - Difference: 21 - 18 = 3 hours\n\n4. **Combine the Differences:**\n   - Hours: 3\n   - Minutes: 12\n   - Seconds: 27\n   - Milliseconds: 60\n\n5. **Format the Duration:**\n   - The duration of the call is 3 hours, 12 minutes, 27 seconds, and 60 milliseconds.\n\nTherefore, the duration of the video call is:\n\n<<<03:12:27.060>>>"
