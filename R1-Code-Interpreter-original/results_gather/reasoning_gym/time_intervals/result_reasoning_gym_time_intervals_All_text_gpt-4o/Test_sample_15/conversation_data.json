    "To determine the operation duration, we need to calculate the difference between the start time and the end time. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Times:**\n   - Start Time: 02:27:35.584\n   - End Time: 18:58:39.935\n\n2. **Convert Times to Milliseconds:**\n   - Convert each component (hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds) to milliseconds for both start and end times.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Milliseconds for Start Time:**\n   - Hours: 2 hours = 2 * 60 * 60 * 1000 = 7,200,000 milliseconds\n   - Minutes: 27 minutes = 27 * 60 * 1000 = 1,620,000 milliseconds\n   - Seconds: 35 seconds = 35 * 1000 = 35,000 milliseconds\n   - Milliseconds: 584 milliseconds\n   - Total Start Time in milliseconds = 7,200,000 + 1,620,000 + 35,000 + 584 = 8,855,584 milliseconds\n\n4. **Calculate Total Milliseconds for End Time:**\n   - Hours: 18 hours = 18 * 60 * 60 * 1000 = 64,800,000 milliseconds\n   - Minutes: 58 minutes = 58 * 60 * 1000 = 3,480,000 milliseconds\n   - Seconds: 39 seconds = 39 * 1000 = 39,000 milliseconds\n   - Milliseconds: 935 milliseconds\n   - Total End Time in milliseconds = 64,800,000 + 3,480,000 + 39,000 + 935 = 68,319,935 milliseconds\n\n5. **Calculate the Duration in Milliseconds:**\n   - Duration in milliseconds = Total End Time - Total Start Time\n   - Duration in milliseconds = 68,319,935 - 8,855,584 = 59,464,351 milliseconds\n\n6. **Convert Duration Back to HH:MM:SS.mmm:**\n   - Hours: 59,464,351 milliseconds / (60 * 60 * 1000) = 16 hours\n   - Remaining milliseconds after hours: 59,464,351 - (16 * 60 * 60 * 1000) = 3,464,351 milliseconds\n   - Minutes: 3,464,351 milliseconds / (60 * 1000) = 57 minutes\n   - Remaining milliseconds after minutes: 3,464,351 - (57 * 60 * 1000) = 23,351 milliseconds\n   - Seconds: 23,351 milliseconds / 1000 = 23 seconds\n   - Remaining milliseconds after seconds: 23,351 - (23 * 1000) = 351 milliseconds\n\n7. **Compile the Duration:**\n   - The operation duration is 16 hours, 31 minutes, 4 seconds, and 351 milliseconds.\n\nTherefore, the operation duration is <<<16:31:04.351>>>."
