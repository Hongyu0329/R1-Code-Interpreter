    "To determine the duration of the video call, we need to calculate the difference between the start time and the end time. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Times:**\n   - Start Time: 14:35:19\n   - End Time: 23:22:55\n\n2. **Convert Both Times to Seconds:**\n   - Convert the start time to seconds:\n     - Hours: 14 hours = 14 * 3600 = 50,400 seconds\n     - Minutes: 35 minutes = 35 * 60 = 2,100 seconds\n     - Seconds: 19 seconds = 19 seconds\n     - Total Start Time in Seconds = 50,400 + 2,100 + 19 = 52,519 seconds\n\n   - Convert the end time to seconds:\n     - Hours: 23 hours = 23 * 3600 = 82,800 seconds\n     - Minutes: 22 minutes = 22 * 60 = 1,320 seconds\n     - Seconds: 55 seconds = 55 seconds\n     - Total End Time in Seconds = 82,800 + 1,320 + 55 = 84,175 seconds\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference in Seconds:**\n   - Difference in Seconds = Total End Time in Seconds - Total Start Time in Seconds\n   - Difference in Seconds = 84,175 - 52,519 = 31,656 seconds\n\n4. **Convert the Difference Back to HH:MM:SS:**\n   - Calculate the hours:\n     - Hours = 31,656 seconds รท 3600 = 8 hours (since 31,656 รท 3600 = 8 with a remainder)\n     - Remaining Seconds = 31,656 - (8 * 3600) = 31,656 - 28,800 = 2,856 seconds\n\n   - Calculate the minutes:\n     - Minutes = 2,856 seconds รท 60 = 47 minutes (since 2,856 รท 60 = 47 with a remainder)\n     - Remaining Seconds = 2,856 - (47 * 60) = 2,856 - 2,820 = 36 seconds\n\n   - Remaining seconds are already calculated as 36 seconds.\n\n5. **Combine the Results:**\n   - The duration of the call is 8 hours, 47 minutes, and 36 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the duration of the video call is <<<08:47:36>>>."
