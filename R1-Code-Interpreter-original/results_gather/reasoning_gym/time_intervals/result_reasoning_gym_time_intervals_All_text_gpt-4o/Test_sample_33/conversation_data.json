    "To determine the duration of the meeting in days, we need to calculate the number of days between the start date and the end date. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Dates:**\n   - Start Date: December 24, 2312\n   - End Date: February 27, 2313\n\n2. **Calculate Days Remaining in the Start Month:**\n   - December 24, 2312, to December 31, 2312\n   - December has 31 days, so there are \\(31 - 24 = 7\\) days remaining in December.\n\n3. **Calculate Days in the Full Months Between:**\n   - The full month between the start and end dates is January 2313.\n   - January has 31 days.\n\n4. **Calculate Days in the End Month:**\n   - From February 1, 2313, to February 27, 2313\n   - This is 27 days.\n\n5. **Sum All the Days:**\n   - Days in December 2312: 7 days\n   - Days in January 2313: 31 days\n   - Days in February 2313: 27 days\n\n6. **Total Duration:**\n   - Total days = 7 (December) + 31 (January) + 27 (February) = 65 days\n\nTherefore, the meeting lasted for 65 days.\n\nThe final answer is enclosed within triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<65>>>"
