    "To determine the total backup duration, we need to carefully analyze the given timestamps, taking into account the time zones and the date and time differences. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Start and End Timestamps:**\n   - Start: 1966-04-13 22:25:40 -0500\n   - End: 1966-05-12 10:25:16 -0900\n\n2. **Convert Time Zones to a Common Reference:**\n   - The start time is in the -0500 time zone, which is 5 hours behind UTC.\n   - The end time is in the -0900 time zone, which is 9 hours behind UTC.\n   - To compare these times directly, we should convert both to UTC.\n\n3. **Convert Start Time to UTC:**\n   - Start time in UTC: 1966-04-13 22:25:40 + 5 hours = 1966-04-14 03:25:40 UTC\n\n4. **Convert End Time to UTC:**\n   - End time in UTC: 1966-05-12 10:25:16 + 9 hours = 1966-05-12 19:25:16 UTC\n\n5. **Calculate the Duration Between the Two UTC Times:**\n   - Start: 1966-04-14 03:25:40 UTC\n   - End: 1966-05-12 19:25:16 UTC\n\n6. **Calculate the Difference:**\n   - First, calculate the difference in days:\n     - From 1966-04-14 to 1966-05-12 is 28 days.\n   - Next, calculate the difference in time on the last day:\n     - From 03:25:40 to 19:25:16 is 16 hours, 59 minutes, and 36 seconds.\n\n7. **Combine the Differences:**\n   - Total duration: 28 days, 16 hours, 59 minutes, and 36 seconds.\n\n8. **Format the Answer:**\n   - The duration is expressed as D days, HH:MM:SS.\n\nTherefore, the total backup duration is:\n\n<<<28 days, 16:59:36>>>"
