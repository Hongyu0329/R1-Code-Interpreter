    "To determine the time elapsed from 09:44 to 17:56, we need to calculate the difference between these two times. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Times:**\n   - Start time: 09:44\n   - End time: 17:56\n\n2. **Calculate the Difference in Hours:**\n   - The start time is 09:44, which is 9 hours and 44 minutes.\n   - The end time is 17:56, which is 17 hours and 56 minutes.\n   - To find the difference in hours, subtract the start hour from the end hour: \n     \\[\n     17 - 9 = 8 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference in Minutes:**\n   - The start time has 44 minutes, and the end time has 56 minutes.\n   - To find the difference in minutes, subtract the start minutes from the end minutes:\n     \\[\n     56 - 44 = 12 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Combine the Differences:**\n   - The total time elapsed is 8 hours and 12 minutes.\n\n5. **Format the Answer:**\n   - The time elapsed is formatted in HH:MM as 08:12.\n\nTherefore, the time elapsed from 09:44 to 17:56 is <<<08:12>>>."
