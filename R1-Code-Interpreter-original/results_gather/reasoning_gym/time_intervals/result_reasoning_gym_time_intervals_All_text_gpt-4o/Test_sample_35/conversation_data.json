    "To determine the duration of the flight, we need to calculate the time difference between the departure and arrival times. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Departure and Arrival Times:**\n   - Departure Time: 03:49\n   - Arrival Time: 20:51\n\n2. **Convert Times to a 24-hour Format:**\n   - Both times are already in 24-hour format, so no conversion is needed.\n\n3. **Calculate the Time Difference:**\n   - We need to find the difference between 20:51 and 03:49.\n\n4. **Break Down the Time Calculation:**\n   - Start by calculating the difference in hours and minutes separately.\n\n5. **Calculate the Minutes:**\n   - Arrival Minutes: 51\n   - Departure Minutes: 49\n   - Minutes Difference: 51 - 49 = 2 minutes\n\n6. **Calculate the Hours:**\n   - Arrival Hours: 20\n   - Departure Hours: 3\n   - Hours Difference: 20 - 3 = 17 hours\n\n7. **Combine the Hours and Minutes:**\n   - The total flight duration is 17 hours and 2 minutes.\n\n8. **Format the Answer:**\n   - The duration should be formatted in HH:MM.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the flight duration.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<17:02>>>."
