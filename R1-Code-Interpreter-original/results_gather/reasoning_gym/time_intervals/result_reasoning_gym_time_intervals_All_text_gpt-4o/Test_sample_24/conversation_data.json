    "To determine the duration of the meeting, we need to calculate the difference between the start and end times. Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Date and Time:**\n   - Start: 2837-06-30 16:19\n   - End: 2837-09-08 07:38\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Days Between the Dates:**\n   - From June 30 to July 30 is 30 days (since June has 30 days).\n   - From July 30 to August 30 is 31 days (since July has 31 days).\n   - From August 30 to September 8 is 9 days.\n\n   Total days = 30 (June 30 to July 30) + 31 (July 30 to August 30) + 9 (August 30 to September 8) = 70 days.\n\n3. **Calculate the Time Difference on the Last Day:**\n   - Start time on June 30: 16:19\n   - End time on September 8: 07:38\n\n   Since the meeting ends on September 8 at 07:38, we need to calculate the time from 16:19 on the previous day (September 7) to 07:38 on September 8.\n\n   - From 16:19 to midnight (00:00) is 7 hours and 41 minutes.\n   - From midnight to 07:38 is 7 hours and 38 minutes.\n\n   Total time from 16:19 on September 7 to 07:38 on September 8 is:\n   - Hours: 7 + 7 = 14 hours\n   - Minutes: 41 + 38 = 79 minutes\n\n   Since 79 minutes is more than an hour, we convert 60 minutes to 1 hour:\n   - 79 minutes = 1 hour and 19 minutes\n\n   Therefore, the total time is 14 hours + 1 hour = 15 hours and 19 minutes.\n\n4. **Combine Days and Time:**\n   - Total days: 70 days\n   - Total time on the last day: 15 hours and 19 minutes\n\n5. **Format the Answer:**\n   - The meeting lasted for 70 days, 15 hours, and 19 minutes.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<70 days, 15:19:00>>>"
