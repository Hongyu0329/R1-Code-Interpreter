    "To determine the duration of the flight, we need to calculate the difference between the departure time and the arrival time. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Departure and Arrival Times:**\n   - Departure Time: 22:52:05\n   - Arrival Time: 23:52:12\n\n2. **Understand the Time Format:**\n   - The time is given in a 24-hour format (HH:MM:SS).\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference in Seconds:**\n   - First, calculate the difference in seconds for each component (hours, minutes, seconds) separately.\n\n4. **Calculate the Difference in Seconds:**\n   - Departure Seconds: 5\n   - Arrival Seconds: 12\n   - Difference in Seconds: 12 - 5 = 7 seconds\n\n5. **Calculate the Difference in Minutes:**\n   - Departure Minutes: 52\n   - Arrival Minutes: 52\n   - Difference in Minutes: 52 - 52 = 0 minutes\n\n6. **Calculate the Difference in Hours:**\n   - Departure Hours: 22\n   - Arrival Hours: 23\n   - Difference in Hours: 23 - 22 = 1 hour\n\n7. **Combine the Differences:**\n   - The total difference is 1 hour, 0 minutes, and 7 seconds.\n\n8. **Format the Duration:**\n   - The duration of the flight is formatted as HH:MM:SS.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the duration of the flight.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<01:00:07>>>."
