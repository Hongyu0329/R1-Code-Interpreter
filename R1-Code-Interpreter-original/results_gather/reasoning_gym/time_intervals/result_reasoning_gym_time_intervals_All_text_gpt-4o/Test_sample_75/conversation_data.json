    "To determine the duration of the flight, we need to calculate the difference between the departure time and the arrival time. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Departure and Arrival Times:**\n   - Departure Time: 19:37:49\n   - Arrival Time: 22:56:23\n\n2. **Convert Times to Seconds:**\n   - Convert both times into total seconds from the start of the day (00:00:00) to make the calculation easier.\n\n   - **Departure Time in Seconds:**\n     - Hours: 19 hours = 19 * 3600 = 68,400 seconds\n     - Minutes: 37 minutes = 37 * 60 = 2,220 seconds\n     - Seconds: 49 seconds = 49 seconds\n     - Total Departure Time in Seconds = 68,400 + 2,220 + 49 = 70,669 seconds\n\n   - **Arrival Time in Seconds:**\n     - Hours: 22 hours = 22 * 3600 = 79,200 seconds\n     - Minutes: 56 minutes = 56 * 60 = 3,360 seconds\n     - Seconds: 23 seconds = 23 seconds\n     - Total Arrival Time in Seconds = 79,200 + 3,360 + 23 = 82,583 seconds\n\n3. **Calculate the Duration in Seconds:**\n   - Duration in Seconds = Arrival Time in Seconds - Departure Time in Seconds\n   - Duration in Seconds = 82,583 - 70,669 = 11,914 seconds\n\n4. **Convert the Duration Back to HH:MM:SS:**\n   - **Hours:**\n     - Total Hours = 11,914 seconds รท 3600 seconds/hour = 3 hours (integer division)\n     - Remaining Seconds = 11,914 - (3 * 3600) = 1,114 seconds\n\n   - **Minutes:**\n     - Total Minutes = 1,114 seconds รท 60 seconds/minute = 18 minutes (integer division)\n     - Remaining Seconds = 1,114 - (18 * 60) = 34 seconds\n\n   - **Seconds:**\n     - Remaining Seconds = 34 seconds\n\n5. **Combine the Results:**\n   - The flight duration is 3 hours, 18 minutes, and 34 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the duration of the flight is <<<03:18:34>>>."
