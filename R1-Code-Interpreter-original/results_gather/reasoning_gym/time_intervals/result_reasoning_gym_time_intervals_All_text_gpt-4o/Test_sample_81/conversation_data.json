    "To determine the duration between two times, 20:55 and 22:10, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Time Format**: The times are given in a 24-hour format. This means 20:55 is 8:55 PM and 22:10 is 10:10 PM.\n\n2. **Break Down the Times**:\n   - Start Time: 20:55\n   - End Time: 22:10\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference in Hours**:\n   - The hour part of the start time is 20, and the hour part of the end time is 22.\n   - The difference in hours is 22 - 20 = 2 hours.\n\n4. **Calculate the Difference in Minutes**:\n   - The minute part of the start time is 55, and the minute part of the end time is 10.\n   - Since 10 is less than 55, we need to adjust the hour difference by borrowing 1 hour (60 minutes) from the hour difference.\n   - Adjusted hour difference: 2 hours - 1 hour = 1 hour.\n   - Adjusted minute calculation: 10 + 60 (borrowed minutes) - 55 = 15 minutes.\n\n5. **Combine the Differences**:\n   - The total duration is 1 hour and 15 minutes.\n\n6. **Format the Answer**:\n   - The duration in HH:MM format is 01:15.\n\nTherefore, the duration between 20:55 and 22:10 is <<<01:15>>>."
