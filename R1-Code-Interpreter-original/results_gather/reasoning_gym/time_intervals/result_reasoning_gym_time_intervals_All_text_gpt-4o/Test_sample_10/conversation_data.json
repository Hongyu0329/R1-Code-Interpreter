    "To determine the total backup duration, we need to calculate the difference between the start and end times. Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Dates and Times:**\n   - Start: 2964-06-17 08:15:14\n   - End: 2964-07-04 11:59:09\n\n2. **Calculate the Difference in Days:**\n   - The start date is June 17, and the end date is July 4.\n   - From June 17 to June 30, there are 13 days (since June has 30 days).\n   - From July 1 to July 4, there are 4 days.\n   - Total days = 13 + 4 = 17 days\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference in Time:**\n   - Start time: 08:15:14\n   - End time: 11:59:09\n\n4. **Calculate the Difference in Hours, Minutes, and Seconds:**\n   - Start time: 08:15:14\n   - End time: 11:59:09\n\n   - **Hours:**\n     - From 08:00 to 11:00 is 3 hours.\n   - **Minutes:**\n     - From 15 minutes to 59 minutes is 44 minutes.\n   - **Seconds:**\n     - From 14 seconds to 09 seconds is -5 seconds, which means we need to adjust by borrowing 1 minute (60 seconds) from the minutes.\n     - Adjusted seconds: 60 - 5 = 55 seconds\n     - Adjusted minutes: 44 - 1 = 43 minutes\n\n5. **Combine the Results:**\n   - Total duration: 17 days, 3 hours, 43 minutes, and 55 seconds.\n\n6. **Format the Answer:**\n   - The question asks for the answer in the format D days, HH:MM.\n   - Therefore, we ignore the seconds and present the answer as 17 days, 03:43.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<17 days, 03:43>>>"
