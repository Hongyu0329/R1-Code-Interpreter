    "To calculate the time difference between 06:09 and 11:40, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Times:**\n   - Start time: 06:09\n   - End time: 11:40\n\n2. **Break Down the Times into Hours and Minutes:**\n   - Start time: 6 hours and 9 minutes\n   - End time: 11 hours and 40 minutes\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference in Hours:**\n   - Subtract the start hour from the end hour: \n     \\[\n     11 \\, \\text{hours} - 6 \\, \\text{hours} = 5 \\, \\text{hours}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Difference in Minutes:**\n   - Subtract the start minutes from the end minutes:\n     \\[\n     40 \\, \\text{minutes} - 9 \\, \\text{minutes} = 31 \\, \\text{minutes}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Combine the Differences:**\n   - The total time difference is 5 hours and 31 minutes.\n\n6. **Express the Result in HH:MM Format:**\n   - The time difference is expressed as 05:31.\n\nBy following these steps, we have calculated the time difference between 06:09 and 11:40.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<05:31>>>."
