    "To determine the total backup duration, we need to calculate the time difference between the start and end times. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Times:**\n   - Start Time: 19:47\n   - End Time: 21:21\n\n2. **Convert Times to Minutes Since Midnight:**\n   - Start Time: \n     - 19 hours = 19 * 60 = 1140 minutes\n     - 47 minutes\n     - Total for Start Time = 1140 + 47 = 1187 minutes since midnight\n   - End Time:\n     - 21 hours = 21 * 60 = 1260 minutes\n     - 21 minutes\n     - Total for End Time = 1260 + 21 = 1281 minutes since midnight\n\n3. **Calculate the Duration in Minutes:**\n   - Duration = End Time in minutes - Start Time in minutes\n   - Duration = 1281 - 1187 = 94 minutes\n\n4. **Convert the Duration from Minutes to HH:MM Format:**\n   - Hours = 94 minutes รท 60 = 1 hour (since 60 minutes make an hour)\n   - Remaining Minutes = 94 minutes % 60 = 34 minutes\n\n5. **Combine the Hours and Minutes:**\n   - The total backup duration is 1 hour and 34 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the total backup duration in HH:MM format is:\n\n<<<01:34>>>"
