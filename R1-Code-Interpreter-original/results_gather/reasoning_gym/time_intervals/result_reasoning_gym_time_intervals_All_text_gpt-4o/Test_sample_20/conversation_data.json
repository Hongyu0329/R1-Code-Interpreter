    "To determine the duration of the database query, we need to calculate the difference between the start and end times. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Times:**\n   - Start Time: 01:56:46.495\n   - End Time: 20:36:33.370\n\n2. **Convert Times to a Common Format:**\n   - Both times are already in the format HH:MM:SS.mmm, which is suitable for direct comparison.\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference in Hours, Minutes, Seconds, and Milliseconds:**\n\n   - **Milliseconds:**\n     - Start: 495 ms\n     - End: 370 ms\n     - Since 370 ms is less than 495 ms, we need to borrow 1 second (1000 ms) from the seconds part of the end time.\n     - New End Milliseconds: 370 + 1000 = 1370 ms\n     - Millisecond Difference: 1370 - 495 = 875 ms\n\n   - **Seconds:**\n     - Start: 46 seconds\n     - End: 33 seconds (after borrowing 1 second, it becomes 32 seconds)\n     - Since 32 seconds is less than 46 seconds, we need to borrow 1 minute (60 seconds) from the minutes part of the end time.\n     - New End Seconds: 32 + 60 = 92 seconds\n     - Second Difference: 92 - 46 = 46 seconds\n\n   - **Minutes:**\n     - Start: 56 minutes\n     - End: 36 minutes (after borrowing 1 minute, it becomes 35 minutes)\n     - Since 35 minutes is less than 56 minutes, we need to borrow 1 hour (60 minutes) from the hours part of the end time.\n     - New End Minutes: 35 + 60 = 95 minutes\n     - Minute Difference: 95 - 56 = 39 minutes\n\n   - **Hours:**\n     - Start: 01 hour\n     - End: 20 hours (after borrowing 1 hour, it becomes 19 hours)\n     - Hour Difference: 19 - 1 = 18 hours\n\n4. **Compile the Total Duration:**\n   - The total duration of the query is 18 hours, 39 minutes, 46 seconds, and 875 milliseconds.\n\n5. **Format the Answer:**\n   - The duration in the required format HH:MM:SS.mmm is 18:39:46.875.\n\nTherefore, the query took <<<18:39:46.875>>>."
