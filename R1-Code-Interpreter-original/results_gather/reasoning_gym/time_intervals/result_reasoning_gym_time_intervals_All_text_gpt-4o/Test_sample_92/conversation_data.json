    "To determine how long the database query took, we need to calculate the difference between the start and end times. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Times:**\n   - Start Time: 17:00:11.426\n   - End Time: 17:32:34.712\n\n2. **Break Down the Times into Components:**\n   - Start Time: \n     - Hours: 17\n     - Minutes: 00\n     - Seconds: 11\n     - Milliseconds: 426\n   - End Time:\n     - Hours: 17\n     - Minutes: 32\n     - Seconds: 34\n     - Milliseconds: 712\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference in Each Component:**\n   - **Milliseconds:**\n     - End Milliseconds: 712\n     - Start Milliseconds: 426\n     - Difference: 712 - 426 = 286 milliseconds\n\n   - **Seconds:**\n     - End Seconds: 34\n     - Start Seconds: 11\n     - Difference: 34 - 11 = 23 seconds\n\n   - **Minutes:**\n     - End Minutes: 32\n     - Start Minutes: 00\n     - Difference: 32 - 00 = 32 minutes\n\n   - **Hours:**\n     - End Hours: 17\n     - Start Hours: 17\n     - Difference: 17 - 17 = 0 hours\n\n4. **Combine the Differences:**\n   - The total duration of the query is 0 hours, 32 minutes, 23 seconds, and 286 milliseconds.\n\n5. **Format the Answer:**\n   - The duration is formatted as HH:MM:SS.mmm, which is 00:32:23.286.\n\nTherefore, the query took <<<00:32:23.286>>>."
