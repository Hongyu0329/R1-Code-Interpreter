    "To determine the duration of the flight, we need to calculate the number of days between the departure date and the arrival date. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Departure Date:**\n   - The flight departed on 2761-06-29, which is a Thursday.\n\n2. **Identify the Arrival Date:**\n   - The flight arrived on 2761-07-30, which is a Sunday.\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Days in June:**\n   - The departure date is June 29, 2761. June has 30 days in total.\n   - Therefore, the number of days remaining in June after the departure is:\n     - June 30 - June 29 = 1 day\n\n4. **Calculate the Number of Days in July:**\n   - The flight arrived on July 30, 2761.\n   - Since the flight arrived on July 30, we count all the days from July 1 to July 30.\n   - This gives us 30 days in July.\n\n5. **Add the Days from June and July:**\n   - Days remaining in June: 1 day\n   - Days in July: 30 days\n   - Total duration of the flight: 1 day (June) + 30 days (July) = 31 days\n\nTherefore, the flight duration is 31 days.\n\nThe final answer is enclosed within triple angle brackets: <<<31 days>>>."
