    "To determine the duration between the two given times, we need to perform a step-by-step analysis of the time difference. The times given are 11:49:32.402 and 13:25:13.695. We will break down the calculation into hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.\n\n1. **Identify the components of each time:**\n   - Start time: 11:49:32.402\n     - Hours: 11\n     - Minutes: 49\n     - Seconds: 32\n     - Milliseconds: 402\n   - End time: 13:25:13.695\n     - Hours: 13\n     - Minutes: 25\n     - Seconds: 13\n     - Milliseconds: 695\n\n2. **Calculate the difference in milliseconds:**\n   - End milliseconds: 695\n   - Start milliseconds: 402\n   - Difference: 695 - 402 = 293 milliseconds\n\n3. **Calculate the difference in seconds:**\n   - End seconds: 13\n   - Start seconds: 32\n   - Since 13 is less than 32, we need to borrow 1 minute (60 seconds) from the minutes.\n   - Adjusted end seconds: 13 + 60 = 73\n   - Difference: 73 - 32 = 41 seconds\n\n4. **Calculate the difference in minutes:**\n   - End minutes: 25 (after borrowing 1 minute, it becomes 24)\n   - Start minutes: 49\n   - Since 24 is less than 49, we need to borrow 1 hour (60 minutes) from the hours.\n   - Adjusted end minutes: 24 + 60 = 84\n   - Difference: 84 - 49 = 35 minutes\n\n5. **Calculate the difference in hours:**\n   - End hours: 13 (after borrowing 1 hour, it becomes 12)\n   - Start hours: 11\n   - Difference: 12 - 11 = 1 hour\n\n6. **Combine the differences to get the total duration:**\n   - Hours: 1\n   - Minutes: 35\n   - Seconds: 41\n   - Milliseconds: 293\n\nTherefore, the duration between 11:49:32.402 and 13:25:13.695 is 1 hour, 35 minutes, 41 seconds, and 293 milliseconds.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<01:35:41.293>>>."
