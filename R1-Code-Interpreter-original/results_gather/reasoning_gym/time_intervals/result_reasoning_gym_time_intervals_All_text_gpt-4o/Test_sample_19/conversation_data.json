    "To determine the duration of the meeting, we need to calculate the difference between the start time and the end time. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Times:**\n   - Start Time: 16:35:10\n   - End Time: 18:49:34\n\n2. **Convert Times to Seconds:**\n   - Convert both the start and end times into total seconds from the start of the day (00:00:00) to make the calculation easier.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Seconds for Start Time:**\n   - Hours: 16 hours = 16 * 3600 = 57,600 seconds\n   - Minutes: 35 minutes = 35 * 60 = 2,100 seconds\n   - Seconds: 10 seconds\n   - Total for Start Time = 57,600 + 2,100 + 10 = 59,710 seconds\n\n4. **Calculate Total Seconds for End Time:**\n   - Hours: 18 hours = 18 * 3600 = 64,800 seconds\n   - Minutes: 49 minutes = 49 * 60 = 2,940 seconds\n   - Seconds: 34 seconds\n   - Total for End Time = 64,800 + 2,940 + 34 = 67,774 seconds\n\n5. **Calculate the Difference in Seconds:**\n   - Difference = Total End Time Seconds - Total Start Time Seconds\n   - Difference = 67,774 - 59,710 = 8,064 seconds\n\n6. **Convert the Difference Back to HH:MM:SS:**\n   - Hours: 8,064 seconds รท 3600 = 2 hours (with a remainder)\n   - Remaining Seconds: 8,064 - (2 * 3600) = 1,864 seconds\n   - Minutes: 1,864 seconds รท 60 = 31 minutes (with a remainder)\n   - Remaining Seconds: 1,864 - (31 * 60) = 4 seconds\n\n7. **Compile the Duration:**\n   - The meeting lasted for 2 hours, 31 minutes, and 4 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the duration of the meeting is <<<02:31:04>>>."
