    "To determine the duration of the conference call, we need to calculate the difference between the start time and the end time. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Times:**\n   - Start Time: 03:32:30.472\n   - End Time: 10:12:35.776\n\n2. **Break Down the Times into Components:**\n   - Start Time: 03 hours, 32 minutes, 30 seconds, and 472 milliseconds.\n   - End Time: 10 hours, 12 minutes, 35 seconds, and 776 milliseconds.\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference in Milliseconds:**\n   - End milliseconds: 776\n   - Start milliseconds: 472\n   - Difference: 776 - 472 = 304 milliseconds\n\n4. **Calculate the Difference in Seconds:**\n   - End seconds: 35\n   - Start seconds: 30\n   - Difference: 35 - 30 = 5 seconds\n\n5. **Calculate the Difference in Minutes:**\n   - End minutes: 12\n   - Start minutes: 32\n   - Since 12 is less than 32, we need to borrow 1 hour (60 minutes) from the hours.\n   - Adjusted end minutes: 12 + 60 = 72\n   - Difference: 72 - 32 = 40 minutes\n\n6. **Calculate the Difference in Hours:**\n   - End hours: 10\n   - Start hours: 3\n   - We borrowed 1 hour for the minutes calculation, so the effective end hours is 9.\n   - Difference: 9 - 3 = 6 hours\n\n7. **Combine the Differences:**\n   - Hours: 6\n   - Minutes: 40\n   - Seconds: 5\n   - Milliseconds: 304\n\n8. **Format the Duration:**\n   - The duration of the conference call is 06:40:05.304.\n\nTherefore, the duration of the conference call is <<<06:40:05.304>>>."
