    "To determine the time elapsed from 06:37 to 13:52, we need to calculate the difference between these two times. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Times:**\n   - Start time: 06:37\n   - End time: 13:52\n\n2. **Calculate the Difference in Hours:**\n   - The start time is 06:37, which is 6 hours and 37 minutes past midnight.\n   - The end time is 13:52, which is 13 hours and 52 minutes past midnight.\n   - To find the difference in hours, subtract the hour of the start time from the hour of the end time:\n     \\[\n     13 - 6 = 7 \\text{ hours}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference in Minutes:**\n   - The start time has 37 minutes, and the end time has 52 minutes.\n   - To find the difference in minutes, subtract the minutes of the start time from the minutes of the end time:\n     \\[\n     52 - 37 = 15 \\text{ minutes}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Combine the Differences:**\n   - The total time elapsed is 7 hours and 15 minutes.\n\n5. **Format the Answer:**\n   - The elapsed time in HH:MM format is 07:15.\n\nTherefore, the time elapsed from 06:37 to 13:52 is <<<07:15>>>."
