    "To calculate the time difference between 19:37 and 23:22, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Time Format**: \n   - The times are given in a 24-hour format.\n   - 19:37 is equivalent to 7:37 PM.\n   - 23:22 is equivalent to 11:22 PM.\n\n2. **Break Down the Times**:\n   - Start time: 19:37\n   - End time: 23:22\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference in Hours**:\n   - From 19:37 to 23:37 is 4 hours.\n   - However, since the end time is 23:22, we need to adjust this by subtracting the minutes.\n\n4. **Calculate the Difference in Minutes**:\n   - From 37 minutes to 22 minutes, we need to calculate how many minutes are left in the hour and then how many minutes into the next hour.\n   - From 37 to 60 minutes (end of the hour) is 23 minutes.\n   - From 60 minutes to 22 minutes (next hour) is 22 minutes.\n   - Total minutes from 19:37 to 23:22 is 60 - 37 + 22 = 45 minutes.\n\n5. **Combine Hours and Minutes**:\n   - The total time difference is 3 hours and 45 minutes.\n\n6. **Express the Result in HH:MM Format**:\n   - The time difference is 03:45.\n\nTherefore, the time difference between 19:37 and 23:22 is <<<03:45>>>."
