    "To determine the time elapsed from 05:10:13 to 19:43:42, we need to calculate the difference between these two times. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Times:**\n   - Start Time: 05:10:13\n   - End Time: 19:43:42\n\n2. **Convert Both Times to Seconds:**\n   - Convert the start time (05:10:13) to seconds:\n     - Hours to seconds: 5 hours × 3600 seconds/hour = 18,000 seconds\n     - Minutes to seconds: 10 minutes × 60 seconds/minute = 600 seconds\n     - Seconds: 13 seconds\n     - Total for start time: 18,000 + 600 + 13 = 18,613 seconds\n\n   - Convert the end time (19:43:42) to seconds:\n     - Hours to seconds: 19 hours × 3600 seconds/hour = 68,400 seconds\n     - Minutes to seconds: 43 minutes × 60 seconds/minute = 2,580 seconds\n     - Seconds: 42 seconds\n     - Total for end time: 68,400 + 2,580 + 42 = 71,022 seconds\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference in Seconds:**\n   - Subtract the start time in seconds from the end time in seconds:\n     - 71,022 seconds (end time) - 18,613 seconds (start time) = 52,409 seconds\n\n4. **Convert the Difference Back to HH:MM:SS:**\n   - Calculate hours: 52,409 seconds ÷ 3600 seconds/hour = 14 hours (with a remainder)\n   - Calculate remaining seconds after hours: 52,409 - (14 × 3600) = 809 seconds\n   - Calculate minutes: 809 seconds ÷ 60 seconds/minute = 13 minutes (with a remainder)\n   - Calculate remaining seconds after minutes: 809 - (13 × 60) = 29 seconds\n\n5. **Compile the Final Time Elapsed:**\n   - The time elapsed is 14 hours, 33 minutes, and 29 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the time elapsed from 05:10:13 to 19:43:42 is <<<14:33:29>>>."
