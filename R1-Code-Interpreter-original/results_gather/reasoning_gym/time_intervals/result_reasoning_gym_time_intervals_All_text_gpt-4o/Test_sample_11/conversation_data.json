    "To determine the duration of the video call, we need to calculate the difference between the start time and the end time. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Times:**\n   - Start Time: 09:44\n   - End Time: 12:22\n\n2. **Calculate the Difference in Hours:**\n   - The call started at 09:44 and ended at 12:22.\n   - From 09:44 to 10:44 is 1 hour.\n   - From 10:44 to 11:44 is another hour.\n   - From 11:44 to 12:22 is less than an hour, so we need to calculate the minutes separately.\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference in Minutes:**\n   - From 11:44 to 12:22:\n     - 12:22 - 11:44 = 38 minutes\n\n4. **Combine the Hours and Minutes:**\n   - Total hours from 09:44 to 11:44 = 2 hours\n   - Additional minutes from 11:44 to 12:22 = 38 minutes\n\n5. **Express the Total Duration in HH:MM Format:**\n   - The total duration is 2 hours and 38 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the duration of the video call is:\n\n<<<02:38>>>"
