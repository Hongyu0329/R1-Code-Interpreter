    "To determine the total backup duration, we need to calculate the difference between the start time and the end time. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Times:**\n   - Start Time: 21:39:22\n   - End Time: 22:25:43\n\n2. **Convert Times to Seconds:**\n   - Convert both the start and end times into total seconds from the beginning of the day (00:00:00).\n\n   - **Start Time in Seconds:**\n     - Hours: 21 hours = 21 * 3600 = 75,600 seconds\n     - Minutes: 39 minutes = 39 * 60 = 2,340 seconds\n     - Seconds: 22 seconds = 22 seconds\n     - Total Start Time in Seconds = 75,600 + 2,340 + 22 = 77,962 seconds\n\n   - **End Time in Seconds:**\n     - Hours: 22 hours = 22 * 3600 = 79,200 seconds\n     - Minutes: 25 minutes = 25 * 60 = 1,500 seconds\n     - Seconds: 43 seconds = 43 seconds\n     - Total End Time in Seconds = 79,200 + 1,500 + 43 = 80,743 seconds\n\n3. **Calculate the Duration in Seconds:**\n   - Duration in Seconds = Total End Time in Seconds - Total Start Time in Seconds\n   - Duration in Seconds = 80,743 - 77,962 = 2,781 seconds\n\n4. **Convert Duration Back to HH:MM:SS:**\n   - Calculate the number of hours, minutes, and seconds from the total duration in seconds.\n\n   - **Hours:**\n     - Hours = 2,781 seconds รท 3600 seconds/hour = 0 hours (since 2,781 is less than 3,600)\n\n   - **Minutes:**\n     - Remaining Seconds = 2,781 seconds\n     - Minutes = 2,781 รท 60 = 46 minutes (since 2,781 รท 60 = 46 with a remainder)\n\n   - **Seconds:**\n     - Remaining Seconds = 2,781 - (46 * 60) = 2,781 - 2,760 = 21 seconds\n\n5. **Combine the Results:**\n   - The total backup duration is 00 hours, 46 minutes, and 21 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the total backup duration is:\n\n<<<00:46:21>>>"
