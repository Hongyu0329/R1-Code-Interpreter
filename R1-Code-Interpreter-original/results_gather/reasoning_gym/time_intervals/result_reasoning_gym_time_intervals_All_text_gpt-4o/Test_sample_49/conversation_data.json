    "To determine the duration of the conference call, we need to account for the time zone differences and calculate the total elapsed time between the start and end times. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Time Zones:**\n   - The start time is given as 10 December 2700, 17:24 -0800. This means the time is 8 hours behind UTC.\n   - The end time is given as 12 December 2700, 23:12 +0200. This means the time is 2 hours ahead of UTC.\n\n2. **Convert Start and End Times to UTC:**\n   - Start time in UTC: \n     - 10 December 2700, 17:24 -0800 is equivalent to 10 December 2700, 17:24 + 8 hours = 11 December 2700, 01:24 UTC.\n   - End time in UTC:\n     - 12 December 2700, 23:12 +0200 is equivalent to 12 December 2700, 23:12 - 2 hours = 12 December 2700, 21:12 UTC.\n\n3. **Calculate the Duration:**\n   - Start time in UTC: 11 December 2700, 01:24\n   - End time in UTC: 12 December 2700, 21:12\n\n4. **Calculate the Difference:**\n   - From 11 December 2700, 01:24 to 12 December 2700, 01:24 is exactly 1 day.\n   - From 12 December 2700, 01:24 to 12 December 2700, 21:12 is 19 hours and 48 minutes.\n\n5. **Add the Durations:**\n   - Total duration = 1 day + 19 hours + 48 minutes\n   - This can be expressed as 1 day, 19:48:00.\n\nTherefore, the duration of the conference call is:\n\n<<<1 day, 19:48:00>>>"
