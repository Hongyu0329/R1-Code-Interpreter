    "To determine the duration of the flight, we need to calculate the difference between the departure time and the arrival time. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Departure and Arrival Times:**\n   - Departure Time: 03:19:59\n   - Arrival Time: 12:42:10\n\n2. **Convert Times to Seconds:**\n   - Convert both times into total seconds from the start of the day to make the calculation easier.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Seconds for Departure Time:**\n   - Hours: 3 hours = 3 * 3600 = 10,800 seconds\n   - Minutes: 19 minutes = 19 * 60 = 1,140 seconds\n   - Seconds: 59 seconds\n   - Total for Departure: 10,800 + 1,140 + 59 = 12,999 seconds\n\n4. **Calculate Total Seconds for Arrival Time:**\n   - Hours: 12 hours = 12 * 3600 = 43,200 seconds\n   - Minutes: 42 minutes = 42 * 60 = 2,520 seconds\n   - Seconds: 10 seconds\n   - Total for Arrival: 43,200 + 2,520 + 10 = 45,730 seconds\n\n5. **Calculate the Difference in Seconds:**\n   - Difference = Total Arrival Seconds - Total Departure Seconds\n   - Difference = 45,730 - 12,999 = 32,731 seconds\n\n6. **Convert the Difference Back to HH:MM:SS:**\n   - Hours: 32,731 seconds รท 3600 = 9 hours (with a remainder)\n   - Remaining Seconds: 32,731 - (9 * 3600) = 32,731 - 32,400 = 331 seconds\n   - Minutes: 331 seconds รท 60 = 5 minutes (with a remainder)\n   - Remaining Seconds: 331 - (5 * 60) = 331 - 300 = 31 seconds\n\n7. **Compile the Duration:**\n   - The flight duration is 9 hours, 5 minutes, and 31 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the duration of the flight is <<<09:05:31>>>."
