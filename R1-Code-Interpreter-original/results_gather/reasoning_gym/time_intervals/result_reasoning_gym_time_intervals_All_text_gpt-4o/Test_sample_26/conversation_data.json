    "To determine the duration of the operation, we need to calculate the difference between the start and end times, taking into account the time zones.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Times:**\n   - Start: 2959-10-25 20:12:02 +0000\n   - End: 2959-11-19 12:33:46 -0100\n\n2. **Convert End Time to the Same Time Zone as Start Time:**\n   - The start time is in the UTC time zone (+0000).\n   - The end time is in the -0100 time zone, which means it is 1 hour behind UTC.\n   - To convert the end time to UTC, add 1 hour to the end time.\n\n3. **Adjust the End Time:**\n   - Original end time: 2959-11-19 12:33:46 -0100\n   - Convert to UTC: 2959-11-19 13:33:46 +0000\n\n4. **Calculate the Duration:**\n   - Start: 2959-10-25 20:12:02 +0000\n   - Adjusted End: 2959-11-19 13:33:46 +0000\n\n5. **Break Down the Calculation:**\n   - **Days:**\n     - From 2959-10-25 to 2959-11-19 is 25 days (from October 25 to November 19).\n   - **Hours and Minutes:**\n     - Start time: 20:12:02\n     - End time: 13:33:46\n     - Calculate the time difference on the last day:\n       - From 20:12:02 to 13:33:46 of the next day:\n         - First, calculate from 20:12:02 to midnight (00:00:00) of the next day: 3 hours and 48 minutes.\n         - Then, add the time from midnight to 13:33:46: 13 hours and 33 minutes.\n         - Total time on the last day: 3 hours 48 minutes + 13 hours 33 minutes = 17 hours and 21 minutes.\n\n6. **Combine the Results:**\n   - Total duration: 24 days (full days) + 17 hours and 21 minutes.\n\n7. **Final Answer:**\n   - The operation duration is 24 days, 17 hours, and 21 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the operation duration is:\n\n<<<24 days, 17:21>>>"
