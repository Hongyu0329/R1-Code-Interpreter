    "To determine the duration between the two given timestamps, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Timestamps:**\n   - The first timestamp is \"2042-02-17 22:23 -0300\".\n   - The second timestamp is \"2042-05-26 23:02 -0200\".\n\n2. **Convert Timezones to UTC:**\n   - The first timestamp is in the timezone offset of -0300, which means it is 3 hours behind UTC. To convert it to UTC, we add 3 hours.\n     - 2042-02-17 22:23 -0300 becomes 2042-02-18 01:23 UTC.\n   - The second timestamp is in the timezone offset of -0200, which means it is 2 hours behind UTC. To convert it to UTC, we add 2 hours.\n     - 2042-05-26 23:02 -0200 becomes 2042-05-27 01:02 UTC.\n\n3. **Calculate the Duration:**\n   - Now, we calculate the difference between the two UTC timestamps:\n     - Start: 2042-02-18 01:23 UTC\n     - End: 2042-05-27 01:02 UTC\n\n4. **Break Down the Calculation:**\n   - **From 2042-02-18 to 2042-05-18:**\n     - February 18 to March 18: 28 days (since 2042 is not a leap year, February has 28 days)\n     - March 18 to April 18: 31 days\n     - April 18 to May 18: 30 days\n     - Total for these months: 28 + 31 + 30 = 89 days\n\n   - **From 2042-05-18 to 2042-05-27:**\n     - May 18 to May 27: 9 days\n\n   - **Total Days:**\n     - 89 days + 9 days = 98 days\n\n5. **Calculate the Time Difference on the Last Day:**\n   - From 01:23 on 2042-05-18 to 01:02 on 2042-05-27:\n     - The time difference is 23 hours and 39 minutes (since 01:02 is 21 minutes before 01:23).\n\n6. **Combine the Results:**\n   - Total duration is 98 days, 23 hours, and 39 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the duration between the two timestamps is:\n\n<<<98 days, 23:39:00>>>"
