    "To determine the duration of the conference call, we need to calculate the difference between the start and end times, taking into account the time zones.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Times with Time Zones:**\n   - Start: 2001-11-23 23:23:48 +0900\n   - End: 2001-12-22 16:04:33 +1100\n\n2. **Convert Both Times to a Common Time Zone:**\n   - The start time is in a time zone that is 9 hours ahead of UTC (UTC+9).\n   - The end time is in a time zone that is 11 hours ahead of UTC (UTC+11).\n\n3. **Convert Start Time to UTC:**\n   - Start: 2001-11-23 23:23:48 +0900\n   - Convert to UTC by subtracting 9 hours: \n     - 2001-11-23 23:23:48 - 9 hours = 2001-11-23 14:23:48 UTC\n\n4. **Convert End Time to UTC:**\n   - End: 2001-12-22 16:04:33 +1100\n   - Convert to UTC by subtracting 11 hours:\n     - 2001-12-22 16:04:33 - 11 hours = 2001-12-22 05:04:33 UTC\n\n5. **Calculate the Difference Between the Two UTC Times:**\n   - Start: 2001-11-23 14:23:48 UTC\n   - End: 2001-12-22 05:04:33 UTC\n\n6. **Calculate the Duration:**\n   - From 2001-11-23 14:23:48 to 2001-12-22 05:04:33\n\n7. **Break Down the Calculation:**\n   - **Days:**\n     - From 2001-11-23 to 2001-12-22 is 29 days.\n   - **Hours:**\n     - From 14:23:48 to 05:04:33 of the next day is 14 hours and 40 minutes and 45 seconds less than a full day.\n     - 24 hours - 14 hours = 10 hours\n     - 60 minutes - 23 minutes = 37 minutes\n     - 60 seconds - 48 seconds = 12 seconds\n     - Total: 10 hours, 40 minutes, 45 seconds\n\n8. **Combine the Days, Hours, Minutes, and Seconds:**\n   - Total Duration: 28 days, 14 hours, 40 minutes, 45 seconds\n\nTherefore, the conference call lasted for:\n\n<<<28 days, 14:40:45>>>"
