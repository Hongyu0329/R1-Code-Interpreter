    "To calculate the time difference between two timestamps, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Components**: Break down each timestamp into hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.\n   - Start time: 10:58:43.946\n     - Hours: 10\n     - Minutes: 58\n     - Seconds: 43\n     - Milliseconds: 946\n   - End time: 18:11:19.156\n     - Hours: 18\n     - Minutes: 11\n     - Seconds: 19\n     - Milliseconds: 156\n\n2. **Calculate the Difference for Each Component**:\n   - **Milliseconds**: Subtract the milliseconds of the start time from the end time.\n     - 156 (end) - 946 (start) = -790\n     - Since the result is negative, we need to borrow 1 second (1000 milliseconds) from the seconds component.\n     - Adjusted milliseconds: -790 + 1000 = 210\n     - Borrowing 1 second reduces the seconds difference by 1.\n\n   - **Seconds**: Subtract the seconds of the start time from the end time, considering the borrowed second.\n     - 19 (end) - 43 (start) - 1 (borrowed) = -25\n     - Since the result is negative, we need to borrow 1 minute (60 seconds) from the minutes component.\n     - Adjusted seconds: -25 + 60 = 35\n     - Borrowing 1 minute reduces the minutes difference by 1.\n\n   - **Minutes**: Subtract the minutes of the start time from the end time, considering the borrowed minute.\n     - 11 (end) - 58 (start) - 1 (borrowed) = -48\n     - Since the result is negative, we need to borrow 1 hour (60 minutes) from the hours component.\n     - Adjusted minutes: -48 + 60 = 12\n     - Borrowing 1 hour reduces the hours difference by 1.\n\n   - **Hours**: Subtract the hours of the start time from the end time, considering the borrowed hour.\n     - 18 (end) - 10 (start) - 1 (borrowed) = 7\n\n3. **Compile the Results**: Combine the adjusted differences to express the time difference in HH:MM:SS.mmm format.\n   - Hours: 7\n   - Minutes: 12\n   - Seconds: 35\n   - Milliseconds: 210\n\nTherefore, the time difference between 10:58:43.946 and 18:11:19.156 is:\n\n<<<07:12:35.210>>>"
