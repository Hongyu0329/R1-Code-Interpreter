    "To determine the duration of the system operation, we need to calculate the difference between the start time and the end time. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Times:**\n   - Start Time: 07:53:51\n   - End Time: 18:47:45\n\n2. **Convert Times to Seconds:**\n   - Convert both the start and end times into total seconds from the start of the day (00:00:00) for easier calculation.\n\n   - **Start Time in Seconds:**\n     - Hours: 7 hours = 7 * 3600 = 25,200 seconds\n     - Minutes: 53 minutes = 53 * 60 = 3,180 seconds\n     - Seconds: 51 seconds\n     - Total Start Time in Seconds = 25,200 + 3,180 + 51 = 28,431 seconds\n\n   - **End Time in Seconds:**\n     - Hours: 18 hours = 18 * 3600 = 64,800 seconds\n     - Minutes: 47 minutes = 47 * 60 = 2,820 seconds\n     - Seconds: 45 seconds\n     - Total End Time in Seconds = 64,800 + 2,820 + 45 = 67,665 seconds\n\n3. **Calculate the Duration in Seconds:**\n   - Duration in Seconds = Total End Time in Seconds - Total Start Time in Seconds\n   - Duration in Seconds = 67,665 - 28,431 = 39,234 seconds\n\n4. **Convert Duration Back to HH:MM:SS:**\n   - Calculate the number of hours in the duration:\n     - Hours = 39,234 // 3600 = 10 hours\n     - Remaining Seconds = 39,234 % 3600 = 3,234 seconds\n\n   - Calculate the number of minutes in the remaining seconds:\n     - Minutes = 3,234 // 60 = 53 minutes\n     - Remaining Seconds = 3,234 % 60 = 54 seconds\n\n   - The duration is therefore 10 hours, 53 minutes, and 54 seconds.\n\n5. **Format the Duration:**\n   - The operation duration in HH:MM:SS format is 10:53:54.\n\nThe final answer is enclosed within triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<10:53:54>>>"
