    "To determine the duration between the two given times, 02:59:41 and 19:43:31, we need to perform a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Time Format**: \n   - Both times are given in the format HH:MM:SS, which stands for hours, minutes, and seconds.\n\n2. **Convert Both Times to Seconds**:\n   - Convert 02:59:41 to seconds:\n     - Hours to seconds: 2 hours * 3600 seconds/hour = 7200 seconds\n     - Minutes to seconds: 59 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 3540 seconds\n     - Seconds: 41 seconds\n     - Total for 02:59:41 = 7200 + 3540 + 41 = 10781 seconds\n\n   - Convert 19:43:31 to seconds:\n     - Hours to seconds: 19 hours * 3600 seconds/hour = 68400 seconds\n     - Minutes to seconds: 43 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 2580 seconds\n     - Seconds: 31 seconds\n     - Total for 19:43:31 = 68400 + 2580 + 31 = 71011 seconds\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference in Seconds**:\n   - Subtract the total seconds of the earlier time from the later time:\n     - 71011 seconds (19:43:31) - 10781 seconds (02:59:41) = 60230 seconds\n\n4. **Convert the Difference Back to HH:MM:SS**:\n   - Calculate hours: 60230 seconds รท 3600 seconds/hour = 16 hours (with a remainder)\n   - Calculate remaining seconds: 60230 - (16 * 3600) = 230 seconds\n   - Calculate minutes: 230 seconds รท 60 seconds/minute = 3 minutes (with a remainder)\n   - Calculate remaining seconds: 230 - (3 * 60) = 50 seconds\n\n5. **Compile the Duration**:\n   - The duration between 02:59:41 and 19:43:31 is 16 hours, 43 minutes, and 50 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the duration between the two times is <<<16:43:50>>>."
