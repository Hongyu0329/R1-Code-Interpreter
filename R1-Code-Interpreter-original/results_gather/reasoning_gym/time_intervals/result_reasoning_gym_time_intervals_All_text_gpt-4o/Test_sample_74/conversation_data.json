    "To determine the duration of the video call, we need to consider the start and end times, including the time zone differences. The start time is given in -1000 time zone, and the end time is in -0600 time zone. We will convert both times to a common time zone, calculate the difference, and then convert it back to the required format.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Convert Start Time to UTC:**\n   - Start time: 30 March 2697, 16:52 -1000\n   - The -1000 time zone is 10 hours behind UTC.\n   - Convert to UTC: 30 March 2697, 16:52 + 10 hours = 31 March 2697, 02:52 UTC\n\n2. **Convert End Time to UTC:**\n   - End time: 07 April 2697, 02:18 -0600\n   - The -0600 time zone is 6 hours behind UTC.\n   - Convert to UTC: 07 April 2697, 02:18 + 6 hours = 07 April 2697, 08:18 UTC\n\n3. **Calculate the Duration in UTC:**\n   - Start time in UTC: 31 March 2697, 02:52\n   - End time in UTC: 07 April 2697, 08:18\n   - Calculate the difference:\n     - From 31 March 02:52 to 07 April 02:52 is exactly 7 days.\n     - From 02:52 to 08:18 on 07 April is 5 hours and 26 minutes.\n\n4. **Combine the Duration:**\n   - Total duration = 7 days + 5 hours + 26 minutes\n   - This results in a total duration of 7 days, 5 hours, and 26 minutes.\n\n5. **Format the Answer:**\n   - The duration is expressed in the format D days, HH:MM.\n\nTherefore, the duration of the video call is:\n\n<<<7 days, 05:26>>>"
