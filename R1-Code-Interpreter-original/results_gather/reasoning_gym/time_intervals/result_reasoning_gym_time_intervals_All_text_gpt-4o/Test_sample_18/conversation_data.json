    "To determine the duration of the meeting in days, we need to calculate the number of days between the start date and the end date. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Dates:**\n   - Start Date: January 29, 2282\n   - End Date: March 16, 2282\n\n2. **Calculate the Days in January:**\n   - The meeting starts on January 29, 2282. Since January has 31 days, the number of days from January 29 to the end of January is:\n     \\[\n     31 - 29 + 1 = 3 \\text{ days}\n     \\]\n   - (We add 1 because January 29 is included in the count.)\n\n3. **Calculate the Days in February:**\n   - February in the year 2282 needs to be checked for leap year status. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not every year divisible by 100 is a leap year unless it is also divisible by 400.\n   - 2282 is not divisible by 4, so it is not a leap year. Therefore, February has 28 days.\n   - The number of days in February is 28 days.\n\n4. **Calculate the Days in March:**\n   - The meeting ends on March 16, 2282. Therefore, the number of days from March 1 to March 16 is:\n     \\[\n     16 \\text{ days}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Sum the Days:**\n   - Add the days from each month to find the total duration of the meeting:\n     \\[\n     3 \\text{ (January)} + 28 \\text{ (February)} + 16 \\text{ (March)} = 47 \\text{ days}\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the meeting lasted for 47 days.\n\nThe final answer is enclosed within triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<47>>>"
