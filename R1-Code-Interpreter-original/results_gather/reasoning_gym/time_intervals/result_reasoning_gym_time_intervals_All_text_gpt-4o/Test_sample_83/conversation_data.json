    "To determine the total backup duration, we need to calculate the difference between the start and end times. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Times:**\n   - Start Time: 06:49:07.114\n   - End Time: 16:36:03.456\n\n2. **Convert Times to a Common Format:**\n   - Both times are already in the format HH:MM:SS.mmm, so no conversion is necessary.\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference in Hours, Minutes, Seconds, and Milliseconds:**\n\n   - **Hours:**\n     - Start Hour: 06\n     - End Hour: 16\n     - Difference in Hours: 16 - 06 = 10 hours\n\n   - **Minutes:**\n     - Start Minute: 49\n     - End Minute: 36\n     - Since 36 is less than 49, we need to borrow 1 hour (60 minutes) from the hours difference.\n     - Adjusted End Minute: 36 + 60 = 96\n     - Difference in Minutes: 96 - 49 = 47 minutes\n     - Adjusted Hours Difference: 10 - 1 = 9 hours\n\n   - **Seconds:**\n     - Start Second: 07\n     - End Second: 03\n     - Since 03 is less than 07, we need to borrow 1 minute (60 seconds) from the minutes difference.\n     - Adjusted End Second: 03 + 60 = 63\n     - Difference in Seconds: 63 - 07 = 56 seconds\n     - Adjusted Minutes Difference: 47 - 1 = 46 minutes\n\n   - **Milliseconds:**\n     - Start Millisecond: 114\n     - End Millisecond: 456\n     - Difference in Milliseconds: 456 - 114 = 342 milliseconds\n\n4. **Compile the Total Duration:**\n   - Total Duration: 09 hours, 46 minutes, 56 seconds, and 342 milliseconds\n\n5. **Format the Answer:**\n   - The total backup duration in the format HH:MM:SS.mmm is 09:46:56.342.\n\nTherefore, the total backup duration is:\n\n<<<09:46:56.342>>>"
