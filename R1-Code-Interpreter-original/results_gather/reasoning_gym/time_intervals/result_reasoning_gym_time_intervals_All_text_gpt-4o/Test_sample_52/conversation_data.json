    "To determine the duration of the video call, we need to calculate the time difference between the start and end times. Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Times:**\n   - Start: Wednesday, February 17, 2602 at 00:33\n   - End: Monday, March 29, 2602 at 07:43\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Days Between the Two Dates:**\n   - February 17 to February 28 (since 2602 is not a leap year, February has 28 days):\n     - Days in February from 17 to 28: 12 days\n   - March 1 to March 29:\n     - Days in March from 1 to 29: 29 days\n\n3. **Total Days Calculation:**\n   - Total days from February 17 to March 29 = 12 days (February) + 29 days (March) = 41 days\n\n4. **Calculate the Time Difference on the Last Day:**\n   - Start time on February 17: 00:33\n   - End time on March 29: 07:43\n   - Time difference on March 29: 07:43 - 00:33\n     - Hours: 7 - 0 = 7 hours\n     - Minutes: 43 - 33 = 10 minutes\n\n5. **Combine Days and Time:**\n   - Total duration = 41 days + 7 hours + 10 minutes\n\n6. **Format the Answer:**\n   - The call lasted for 41 days, 7 hours, and 10 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the duration of the call is:\n\n<<<41 days, 07:10>>>"
