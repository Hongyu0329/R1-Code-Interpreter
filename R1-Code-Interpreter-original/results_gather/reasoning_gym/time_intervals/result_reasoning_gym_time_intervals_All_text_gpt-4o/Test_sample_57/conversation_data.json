    "To determine how long the database query took, we need to calculate the difference between the start time and the end time. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Times:**\n   - Start Time: 19:45\n   - End Time: 20:23\n\n2. **Convert Times to a 24-Hour Format:**\n   - Both times are already in 24-hour format, so no conversion is necessary.\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference in Hours and Minutes:**\n   - Start Time: 19:45\n   - End Time: 20:23\n\n4. **Calculate the Difference in Minutes:**\n   - The minutes part of the end time is 23, and the minutes part of the start time is 45.\n   - Since 23 is less than 45, we need to borrow 1 hour from the hours part of the end time to make the minutes calculation possible.\n   - Borrowing 1 hour from 20:23 gives us 19:83 (since 60 minutes are added to the 23 minutes).\n\n5. **Calculate the Minutes Difference:**\n   - 83 (adjusted end minutes) - 45 (start minutes) = 38 minutes\n\n6. **Calculate the Hours Difference:**\n   - After borrowing 1 hour, the adjusted end hour is 19.\n   - 19 (adjusted end hour) - 19 (start hour) = 0 hours\n\n7. **Combine the Hours and Minutes:**\n   - The total duration is 0 hours and 38 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the query took 38 minutes.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<00:38>>>."
