    "To determine the duration of the video call in days, we need to calculate the number of days between the start date and the end date. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Dates:**\n   - Start Date: Saturday, February 25, 2322\n   - End Date: Wednesday, March 29, 2322\n\n2. **Determine the Number of Days in February 2322:**\n   - February typically has 28 days, but in a leap year, it has 29 days.\n   - A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not every year divisible by 100 is a leap year unless it is also divisible by 400.\n   - 2322 is divisible by 4 (2322 รท 4 = 580.5), but we need to check if it is a leap year.\n   - 2322 is not divisible by 100, so we don't need to check the 400 rule.\n   - Therefore, 2322 is a leap year, and February has 29 days.\n\n3. **Calculate the Days Remaining in February:**\n   - The call started on February 25, so the remaining days in February are:\n     - February 25 to February 29: 5 days (25, 26, 27, 28, 29)\n\n4. **Calculate the Days in March up to the End Date:**\n   - The call ended on March 29.\n   - Therefore, the number of days in March from March 1 to March 29 is 29 days.\n\n5. **Add the Days from February and March:**\n   - Days in February: 5 days\n   - Days in March: 29 days\n   - Total duration of the call: 5 + 29 = 34 days\n\nThus, the video call lasted for 34 days.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<34>>>"
