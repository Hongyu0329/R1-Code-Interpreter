    "To determine the duration of the flight, we need to calculate the difference between the departure time and the arrival time. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Departure and Arrival Times:**\n   - Departure Time: 10:31:12\n   - Arrival Time: 17:45:29\n\n2. **Convert Both Times to Seconds:**\n   - Convert the departure time to seconds:\n     - Hours: 10 hours = 10 * 3600 = 36,000 seconds\n     - Minutes: 31 minutes = 31 * 60 = 1,860 seconds\n     - Seconds: 12 seconds\n     - Total for departure: 36,000 + 1,860 + 12 = 37,872 seconds\n\n   - Convert the arrival time to seconds:\n     - Hours: 17 hours = 17 * 3600 = 61,200 seconds\n     - Minutes: 45 minutes = 45 * 60 = 2,700 seconds\n     - Seconds: 29 seconds\n     - Total for arrival: 61,200 + 2,700 + 29 = 63,929 seconds\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference in Seconds:**\n   - Difference in seconds = Arrival time in seconds - Departure time in seconds\n   - Difference = 63,929 - 37,872 = 26,057 seconds\n\n4. **Convert the Difference Back to HH:MM:SS:**\n   - Calculate hours:\n     - Hours = 26,057 seconds รท 3600 = 7 hours (with a remainder)\n   - Calculate remaining seconds after hours:\n     - Remaining seconds = 26,057 - (7 * 3600) = 26,057 - 25,200 = 857 seconds\n   - Calculate minutes:\n     - Minutes = 857 seconds รท 60 = 14 minutes (with a remainder)\n   - Calculate remaining seconds after minutes:\n     - Remaining seconds = 857 - (14 * 60) = 857 - 840 = 17 seconds\n\n5. **Compile the Duration:**\n   - The flight duration is 7 hours, 14 minutes, and 17 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the duration of the flight is <<<07:14:17>>>."
