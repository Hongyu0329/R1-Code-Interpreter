    "To determine the duration of the video call, we need to carefully analyze the start and end times, taking into account the time zones and the date differences. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Time Zones:**\n   - The start time is given as 2358-04-20 03:51:19 -0100. This means the time is 03:51:19 on April 20, 2358, in a time zone that is 1 hour behind UTC.\n   - The end time is given as 2358-05-13 11:44:31 -0900. This means the time is 11:44:31 on May 13, 2358, in a time zone that is 9 hours behind UTC.\n\n2. **Convert Both Times to UTC:**\n   - Start time in UTC: 2358-04-20 03:51:19 -0100 converts to 2358-04-20 04:51:19 UTC.\n   - End time in UTC: 2358-05-13 11:44:31 -0900 converts to 2358-05-13 20:44:31 UTC.\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference in Time:**\n   - Start: 2358-04-20 04:51:19 UTC\n   - End: 2358-05-13 20:44:31 UTC\n\n4. **Calculate the Duration:**\n   - First, calculate the difference in days:\n     - From April 20 to May 13 is 23 days.\n   - Next, calculate the difference in time on the last day:\n     - From 04:51:19 to 20:44:31 is:\n       - Hours: 20 - 4 = 16 hours\n       - Minutes: 44 - 51 = -7 minutes (borrow 1 hour, so 15 hours and 53 minutes)\n       - Seconds: 31 - 19 = 12 seconds\n\n5. **Combine the Results:**\n   - Total duration is 23 days, 15 hours, and 53 minutes.\n\n6. **Format the Answer:**\n   - The duration of the call is 23 days, 15:53.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<23 days, 15:53>>>"
