    "To determine the duration of the flight, we need to calculate the difference between the departure and arrival times. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Departure and Arrival Dates and Times:**\n   - Departure: Tuesday, May 30, 2699, at 22:34:19\n   - Arrival: Thursday, August 03, 2699, at 05:35:19\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Days Between the Two Dates:**\n   - From May 30 to June 30: 31 days (since May has 31 days)\n   - From June 30 to July 31: 31 days (since July has 31 days)\n   - From July 31 to August 03: 3 days\n\n   Total days from May 30 to August 03 = 31 (June) + 31 (July) + 3 (August) = 65 days\n\n3. **Calculate the Time Difference on the Last Day:**\n   - Departure time on May 30: 22:34:19\n   - Arrival time on August 03: 05:35:19\n\n   To find the time difference on the last day, we need to consider the time from 22:34:19 on May 30 to 05:35:19 on August 03.\n\n4. **Calculate the Time from Departure to Midnight on May 30:**\n   - From 22:34:19 to 24:00:00 (midnight) is 1 hour, 25 minutes, and 41 seconds.\n\n5. **Calculate the Time from Midnight to Arrival on August 03:**\n   - From 00:00:00 to 05:35:19 is 5 hours, 35 minutes, and 19 seconds.\n\n6. **Combine the Time Differences:**\n   - Total time from 22:34:19 on May 30 to 05:35:19 on August 03 is the sum of the time from departure to midnight and from midnight to arrival.\n\n   - Total time = 1 hour, 25 minutes, 41 seconds + 5 hours, 35 minutes, 19 seconds\n   - Combine the hours: 1 + 5 = 6 hours\n   - Combine the minutes: 25 + 35 = 60 minutes (which is 1 hour)\n   - Combine the seconds: 41 + 19 = 60 seconds (which is 1 minute)\n\n   After combining, we have 6 hours + 1 hour (from 60 minutes) + 1 minute (from 60 seconds) = 7 hours and 1 minute.\n\n7. **Adjust the Total Days and Time:**\n   - Since we have an additional hour from the minutes, the total time becomes 7 hours and 1 minute.\n   - Therefore, the total duration of the flight is 65 days and 7 hours, 1 minute.\n\n8. **Format the Final Answer:**\n   - The flight duration is 65 days, 07:01.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<65 days, 07:01>>>."
