    "To determine the duration of the meeting, we need to calculate the difference between the start and end times, taking into account the time zone differences. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Times:**\n   - Start: 2811-11-24 23:37:42 -0200\n   - End: 2812-01-23 02:57:01 -0600\n\n2. **Convert Time Zones to a Common Reference:**\n   - The start time is in the -0200 time zone, which is 2 hours behind UTC.\n   - The end time is in the -0600 time zone, which is 6 hours behind UTC.\n\n3. **Convert Both Times to UTC:**\n   - Start in UTC: 2811-11-25 01:37:42 (adding 2 hours to the start time)\n   - End in UTC: 2812-01-23 08:57:01 (adding 6 hours to the end time)\n\n4. **Calculate the Difference Between the Two UTC Times:**\n   - Start: 2811-11-25 01:37:42\n   - End: 2812-01-23 08:57:01\n\n5. **Break Down the Calculation:**\n   - Calculate the difference in years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds.\n   - From 2811-11-25 to 2812-01-23:\n     - Days: From November 25 to January 23 is 59 days (6 days in November, 31 days in December, and 22 days in January).\n   - Calculate the time difference on the last day:\n     - From 01:37:42 to 08:57:01:\n       - Hours: 7 hours\n       - Minutes: 19 minutes\n       - Seconds: 19 seconds\n\n6. **Combine the Differences:**\n   - Total duration: 59 days, 7 hours, 19 minutes, and 19 seconds.\n\n7. **Format the Answer:**\n   - The question asks for the answer in the format D days, HH:MM.\n   - Therefore, we ignore the seconds and present the answer as 59 days, 07:19.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<59 days, 07:19>>>"
