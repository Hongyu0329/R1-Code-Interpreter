    "To determine the duration of the flight, we need to calculate the time difference between the departure and arrival times. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Departure and Arrival Times:**\n   - Departure Time: 06:46\n   - Arrival Time: 10:55\n\n2. **Calculate the Time Difference:**\n   - We need to find the difference between 10:55 and 06:46.\n\n3. **Break Down the Time Calculation:**\n   - Start by calculating the difference in hours and minutes separately.\n   - **Hours Calculation:**\n     - The hour part of the arrival time is 10, and the hour part of the departure time is 6.\n     - Subtract the departure hour from the arrival hour: 10 - 6 = 4 hours.\n   - **Minutes Calculation:**\n     - The minute part of the arrival time is 55, and the minute part of the departure time is 46.\n     - Subtract the departure minutes from the arrival minutes: 55 - 46 = 9 minutes.\n\n4. **Combine the Hours and Minutes:**\n   - The total flight duration is 4 hours and 9 minutes.\n\n5. **Format the Answer:**\n   - The duration should be expressed in HH:MM format, which is 04:09.\n\nBy following these steps, we have determined the duration of the flight.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<04:09>>>."
