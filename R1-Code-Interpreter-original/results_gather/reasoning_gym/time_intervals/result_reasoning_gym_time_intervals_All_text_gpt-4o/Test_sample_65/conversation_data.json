    "To determine the duration of the conference call, we need to calculate the difference between the start time and the end time. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Times:**\n   - Start Time: 13:51:23\n   - End Time: 14:47:02\n\n2. **Convert Times to Seconds:**\n   - Convert both the start and end times into total seconds from the start of the day (00:00:00) to make the calculation easier.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Seconds for Start Time:**\n   - Hours: 13 hours = 13 * 3600 = 46,800 seconds\n   - Minutes: 51 minutes = 51 * 60 = 3,060 seconds\n   - Seconds: 23 seconds\n   - Total for Start Time: 46,800 + 3,060 + 23 = 49,883 seconds\n\n4. **Calculate Total Seconds for End Time:**\n   - Hours: 14 hours = 14 * 3600 = 50,400 seconds\n   - Minutes: 47 minutes = 47 * 60 = 2,820 seconds\n   - Seconds: 02 seconds\n   - Total for End Time: 50,400 + 2,820 + 2 = 53,222 seconds\n\n5. **Calculate the Difference in Seconds:**\n   - Difference = Total End Time Seconds - Total Start Time Seconds\n   - Difference = 53,222 - 49,883 = 3,339 seconds\n\n6. **Convert the Difference Back to HH:MM:SS:**\n   - Hours: 3,339 seconds รท 3600 = 0 hours (since 3,339 is less than 3,600)\n   - Remaining Seconds: 3,339 seconds % 3600 = 3,339 seconds\n   - Minutes: 3,339 seconds รท 60 = 55 minutes\n   - Remaining Seconds: 3,339 seconds % 60 = 39 seconds\n\n7. **Compile the Duration:**\n   - The duration of the conference call is 0 hours, 55 minutes, and 39 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the conference call lasted for <<<00:55:39>>>."
