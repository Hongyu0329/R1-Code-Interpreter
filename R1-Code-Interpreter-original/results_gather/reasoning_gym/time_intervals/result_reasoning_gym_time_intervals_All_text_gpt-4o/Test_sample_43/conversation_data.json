    "To determine the duration between two dates, we need to calculate the number of days between them. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Dates:**\n   - Start Date: Monday, September 30, 2526\n   - End Date: Wednesday, November 27, 2526\n\n2. **Understand the Month Durations:**\n   - September has 30 days.\n   - October has 31 days.\n   - November has 30 days.\n\n3. **Calculate Days Remaining in September:**\n   - September 30 is the last day of September, so there are 0 days remaining in September after this date.\n\n4. **Calculate Full Month of October:**\n   - October has 31 days, and since we are considering the entire month, we add 31 days.\n\n5. **Calculate Days in November up to the 27th:**\n   - From November 1 to November 27, there are 27 days.\n\n6. **Add the Days Together:**\n   - Days in October: 31\n   - Days in November up to the 27th: 27\n   - Total days = 31 (October) + 27 (November) = 58 days\n\nTherefore, the duration between Monday, September 30, 2526, and Wednesday, November 27, 2526, is 58 days.\n\nThe final answer is enclosed within triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<58 days>>>"
