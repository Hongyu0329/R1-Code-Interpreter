    "To determine the duration of the video call, we need to calculate the difference between the start and end times. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Times:**\n   - Start Time: 09:36:09.235\n   - End Time: 14:26:18.062\n\n2. **Break Down the Times into Components:**\n   - Start Time: \n     - Hours: 09\n     - Minutes: 36\n     - Seconds: 09\n     - Milliseconds: 235\n   - End Time:\n     - Hours: 14\n     - Minutes: 26\n     - Seconds: 18\n     - Milliseconds: 062\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference in Milliseconds:**\n   - End Milliseconds: 062\n   - Start Milliseconds: 235\n   - Since 062 is less than 235, we need to borrow 1 second (1000 milliseconds) from the seconds component of the end time.\n   - Adjusted End Milliseconds: 1062 (062 + 1000)\n   - Millisecond Difference: 1062 - 235 = 827\n\n4. **Calculate the Difference in Seconds:**\n   - Adjusted End Seconds: 17 (18 - 1, due to borrowing 1 second for milliseconds)\n   - Start Seconds: 09\n   - Second Difference: 17 - 09 = 8\n\n5. **Calculate the Difference in Minutes:**\n   - End Minutes: 26\n   - Start Minutes: 36\n   - Since 26 is less than 36, we need to borrow 1 hour (60 minutes) from the hours component of the end time.\n   - Adjusted End Minutes: 86 (26 + 60)\n   - Minute Difference: 86 - 36 = 50\n\n6. **Calculate the Difference in Hours:**\n   - Adjusted End Hours: 13 (14 - 1, due to borrowing 1 hour for minutes)\n   - Start Hours: 09\n   - Hour Difference: 13 - 09 = 4\n\n7. **Combine the Differences:**\n   - Hours: 4\n   - Minutes: 50\n   - Seconds: 8\n   - Milliseconds: 827\n\n8. **Format the Duration:**\n   - The duration of the call is 04:50:08.827\n\nTherefore, the duration of the video call is <<<04:50:08.827>>>."
