    "To determine the duration of the meeting, we need to calculate the difference between the end time and the start time. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Times:**\n   - Start Time: 16:39:51.271\n   - End Time: 16:44:29.429\n\n2. **Convert Times to a Uniform Format:**\n   - Both times are already in the format HH:MM:SS.mmm, so no conversion is necessary.\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference in Seconds and Milliseconds:**\n   - Start Time in seconds: 16 hours * 3600 seconds/hour + 39 minutes * 60 seconds/minute + 51.271 seconds = 59991.271 seconds\n   - End Time in seconds: 16 hours * 3600 seconds/hour + 44 minutes * 60 seconds/minute + 29.429 seconds = 60269.429 seconds\n\n4. **Subtract the Start Time from the End Time:**\n   - Difference in seconds: 60269.429 - 59991.271 = 278.158 seconds\n\n5. **Convert the Difference Back to HH:MM:SS.mmm:**\n   - Total seconds: 278.158\n   - Hours: 278.158 seconds / 3600 seconds/hour = 0 hours (since 278.158 is less than 3600)\n   - Remaining seconds: 278.158 seconds\n   - Minutes: 278.158 seconds / 60 seconds/minute = 4 minutes\n   - Remaining seconds: 278.158 - 4 * 60 = 38.158 seconds\n   - Milliseconds: 0.158 seconds * 1000 = 158 milliseconds\n\n6. **Compile the Final Duration:**\n   - The duration of the meeting is 00:04:38.158\n\nTherefore, the duration of the meeting is <<<00:04:38.158>>>."
