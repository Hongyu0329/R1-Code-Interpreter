    "To determine the total backup duration, we need to calculate the difference between the start and end times. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Times:**\n   - Start Time: 12:34:57.377\n   - End Time: 20:14:35.750\n\n2. **Convert Times to a Uniform Format:**\n   - Both times are already in the format HH:MM:SS.mmm, so no conversion is necessary.\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference in Hours, Minutes, Seconds, and Milliseconds:**\n\n   - **Hours:**\n     - End Hour: 20\n     - Start Hour: 12\n     - Difference in Hours: 20 - 12 = 8 hours\n\n   - **Minutes:**\n     - End Minutes: 14\n     - Start Minutes: 34\n     - Since 14 is less than 34, we need to borrow 1 hour (60 minutes) from the hours difference.\n     - Adjusted End Minutes: 14 + 60 = 74\n     - Difference in Minutes: 74 - 34 = 40 minutes\n     - Adjusted Hours Difference: 8 - 1 = 7 hours\n\n   - **Seconds:**\n     - End Seconds: 35\n     - Start Seconds: 57\n     - Since 35 is less than 57, we need to borrow 1 minute (60 seconds) from the minutes difference.\n     - Adjusted End Seconds: 35 + 60 = 95\n     - Difference in Seconds: 95 - 57 = 38 seconds\n     - Adjusted Minutes Difference: 40 - 1 = 39 minutes\n\n   - **Milliseconds:**\n     - End Milliseconds: 750\n     - Start Milliseconds: 377\n     - Difference in Milliseconds: 750 - 377 = 373 milliseconds\n\n4. **Compile the Total Duration:**\n   - Total Duration: 7 hours, 39 minutes, 38 seconds, and 373 milliseconds\n\n5. **Format the Answer:**\n   - The total backup duration in the format HH:MM:SS.mmm is 07:39:38.373.\n\nTherefore, the total backup duration is:\n\n<<<07:39:38.373>>>"
