    "To determine the duration of the meeting, we need to calculate the difference between the start time and the end time. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Times:**\n   - Start Time: 14:22:38\n   - End Time: 17:20:37\n\n2. **Convert Times to Seconds:**\n   - Convert both the start and end times into total seconds from the start of the day (00:00:00) for easier calculation.\n\n   - **Start Time in Seconds:**\n     - Hours: 14 hours = 14 * 3600 = 50,400 seconds\n     - Minutes: 22 minutes = 22 * 60 = 1,320 seconds\n     - Seconds: 38 seconds\n     - Total Start Time in Seconds = 50,400 + 1,320 + 38 = 51,758 seconds\n\n   - **End Time in Seconds:**\n     - Hours: 17 hours = 17 * 3600 = 61,200 seconds\n     - Minutes: 20 minutes = 20 * 60 = 1,200 seconds\n     - Seconds: 37 seconds\n     - Total End Time in Seconds = 61,200 + 1,200 + 37 = 62,437 seconds\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference in Seconds:**\n   - Difference in Seconds = Total End Time in Seconds - Total Start Time in Seconds\n   - Difference in Seconds = 62,437 - 51,758 = 10,679 seconds\n\n4. **Convert the Difference Back to HH:MM:SS:**\n   - **Hours:**\n     - 10,679 seconds รท 3600 seconds/hour = 2 hours (with a remainder)\n   - **Remaining Seconds:**\n     - 10,679 seconds - (2 * 3600) = 10,679 - 7,200 = 3,479 seconds\n   - **Minutes:**\n     - 3,479 seconds รท 60 seconds/minute = 57 minutes (with a remainder)\n   - **Remaining Seconds:**\n     - 3,479 seconds - (57 * 60) = 3,479 - 3,420 = 59 seconds\n\n5. **Compile the Duration:**\n   - The meeting lasted for 2 hours, 57 minutes, and 59 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the duration of the meeting is <<<02:57:59>>>."
