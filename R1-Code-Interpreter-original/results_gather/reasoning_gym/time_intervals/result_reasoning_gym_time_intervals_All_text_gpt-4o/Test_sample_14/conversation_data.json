    "To determine the duration of the meeting, we need to calculate the time difference between the start and end times. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Times:**\n   - Start Time: 12:02\n   - End Time: 22:43\n\n2. **Convert Times to a 24-Hour Format:**\n   - The times are already in a 24-hour format, so no conversion is necessary.\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference in Hours:**\n   - The meeting starts at 12:02 and ends at 22:43.\n   - From 12:02 to 22:02 is exactly 10 hours.\n\n4. **Calculate the Difference in Minutes:**\n   - From 22:02 to 22:43 is 41 minutes.\n\n5. **Combine the Hours and Minutes:**\n   - The total duration of the meeting is 10 hours and 41 minutes.\n\n6. **Format the Answer:**\n   - The duration should be expressed in HH:MM format.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the total duration of the meeting.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<10:41>>>."
