    "To determine the duration of the flight, we need to calculate the difference between the departure time and the arrival time. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Departure and Arrival Times:**\n   - Departure Time: 14:29:49\n   - Arrival Time: 17:40:42\n\n2. **Convert Times to Seconds:**\n   - Convert both times into seconds since the start of the day to make the calculation easier.\n\n3. **Calculate Seconds for Departure Time:**\n   - Hours: 14 hours = 14 * 3600 = 50,400 seconds\n   - Minutes: 29 minutes = 29 * 60 = 1,740 seconds\n   - Seconds: 49 seconds\n   - Total for Departure: 50,400 + 1,740 + 49 = 52,189 seconds\n\n4. **Calculate Seconds for Arrival Time:**\n   - Hours: 17 hours = 17 * 3600 = 61,200 seconds\n   - Minutes: 40 minutes = 40 * 60 = 2,400 seconds\n   - Seconds: 42 seconds\n   - Total for Arrival: 61,200 + 2,400 + 42 = 63,642 seconds\n\n5. **Calculate the Difference in Seconds:**\n   - Difference = Arrival Time in seconds - Departure Time in seconds\n   - Difference = 63,642 - 52,189 = 11,453 seconds\n\n6. **Convert the Difference Back to HH:MM:SS:**\n   - Hours: 11,453 seconds รท 3600 = 3 hours (with a remainder)\n   - Remaining Seconds: 11,453 - (3 * 3600) = 653 seconds\n   - Minutes: 653 seconds รท 60 = 10 minutes (with a remainder)\n   - Remaining Seconds: 653 - (10 * 60) = 53 seconds\n\n7. **Compile the Final Duration:**\n   - The flight duration is 3 hours, 10 minutes, and 53 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the duration of the flight is:\n\n<<<03:10:53>>>"
