    "To determine the operation duration, we need to calculate the difference between the start and end times. Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Times:**\n   - Start: Sun Sep 20 2972 10:55:09\n   - End: Tue Oct 27 2972 02:38:17\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Days Between the Dates:**\n   - From September 20 to September 30, there are 10 days (since September has 30 days).\n   - From October 1 to October 27, there are 26 days.\n\n   Total days from September 20 to October 27 = 10 days (in September) + 26 days (in October) = 36 days.\n\n3. **Calculate the Time Difference on the Last Day:**\n   - Start time on September 20: 10:55:09\n   - End time on October 27: 02:38:17\n\n   To find the time difference on the last day, we need to consider the time from 10:55:09 on September 20 to 02:38:17 on October 27.\n\n4. **Calculate the Time Difference:**\n   - From 10:55:09 to 10:55:09 the next day is 24 hours.\n   - From 10:55:09 to 02:38:17 on the next day is less than 24 hours, so we need to calculate this separately.\n\n   Let's break it down:\n   - From 10:55:09 to 00:00:00 (midnight) is 13 hours, 4 minutes, and 51 seconds.\n   - From 00:00:00 to 02:38:17 is 2 hours, 38 minutes, and 17 seconds.\n\n   Adding these two intervals:\n   - Hours: 13 + 2 = 15 hours\n   - Minutes: 4 + 38 = 42 minutes\n   - Seconds: 51 + 17 = 68 seconds\n\n   Since 68 seconds is more than a minute, we convert it:\n   - 68 seconds = 1 minute and 8 seconds\n\n   Adjusting the minutes and seconds:\n   - Minutes: 42 + 1 = 43 minutes\n   - Seconds: 8 seconds\n\n5. **Combine the Days and Time:**\n   - Total days: 36 days\n   - Total time: 15 hours, 43 minutes, and 8 seconds\n\n6. **Format the Answer:**\n   - The operation duration is 36 days, 15 hours, and 43 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the operation duration is:\n\n<<<36 days, 15:43>>>"
