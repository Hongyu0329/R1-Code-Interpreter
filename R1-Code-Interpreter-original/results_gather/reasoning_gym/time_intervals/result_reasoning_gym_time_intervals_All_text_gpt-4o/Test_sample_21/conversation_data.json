    "To determine the duration of the video call, we need to calculate the difference between the start and end times, taking into account the time zone differences. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Times:**\n   - Start: 2620-09-08 22:30:59 -0100\n   - End: 2620-12-09 17:28:10 +1100\n\n2. **Convert Both Times to a Common Time Zone:**\n   - The start time is in the -0100 time zone, which is 1 hour behind UTC.\n   - The end time is in the +1100 time zone, which is 11 hours ahead of UTC.\n\n3. **Convert Start Time to UTC:**\n   - Start time in UTC: 2620-09-08 22:30:59 +0100 (since -0100 to UTC is +1 hour)\n\n4. **Convert End Time to UTC:**\n   - End time in UTC: 2620-12-09 06:28:10 +0000 (since +1100 to UTC is -11 hours)\n\n5. **Calculate the Difference Between the Two UTC Times:**\n   - Start: 2620-09-08 22:30:59\n   - End: 2620-12-09 06:28:10\n\n6. **Break Down the Calculation:**\n   - Calculate the difference in days, hours, minutes, and seconds.\n\n7. **Calculate the Days:**\n   - From 2620-09-08 to 2620-12-09 is 3 months.\n   - September has 30 days, October has 31 days, November has 30 days, and December has 9 days up to the end date.\n   - Total days = 22 days (September) + 31 days (October) + 30 days (November) + 9 days (December) = 92 days\n\n8. **Calculate the Time Difference on the Last Day:**\n   - Start time on the last day: 22:30:59\n   - End time on the last day: 06:28:10\n   - Since the end time is earlier in the day than the start time, we need to adjust for the previous day.\n   - Time difference: 06:28:10 - 22:30:59 = 7 hours, 57 minutes, and 11 seconds (after adjusting for the previous day)\n\n9. **Combine the Days and Time Difference:**\n   - Total duration = 91 days (since we adjusted for the previous day) + 7 hours, 57 minutes, and 11 seconds\n\n10. **Final Answer:**\n   - The call lasted for 91 days, 7 hours, 57 minutes, and 11 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the duration of the call is:\n\n<<<91 days, 07:57:11>>>"
