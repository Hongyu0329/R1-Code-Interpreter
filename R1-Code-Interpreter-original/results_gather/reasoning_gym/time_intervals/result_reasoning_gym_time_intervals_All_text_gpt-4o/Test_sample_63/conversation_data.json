    "To determine the operation duration, we need to carefully analyze the given timestamps, taking into account the time zones and the date and time differences. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Start and End Times:**\n   - Start: 2609-01-28 (Saturday) 00:08:51 -1000\n   - End: 2609-01-29 (Sunday) 22:02:04 +0800\n\n2. **Convert Time Zones to a Common Reference:**\n   - The start time is in the -1000 time zone, which is 10 hours behind UTC.\n   - The end time is in the +0800 time zone, which is 8 hours ahead of UTC.\n\n3. **Convert Start Time to UTC:**\n   - Start time in UTC: 2609-01-28 00:08:51 - 10 hours = 2609-01-28 10:08:51 UTC\n\n4. **Convert End Time to UTC:**\n   - End time in UTC: 2609-01-29 22:02:04 - 8 hours = 2609-01-29 14:02:04 UTC\n\n5. **Calculate the Duration in UTC:**\n   - Start: 2609-01-28 10:08:51 UTC\n   - End: 2609-01-29 14:02:04 UTC\n\n6. **Calculate the Difference:**\n   - From 2609-01-28 10:08:51 to 2609-01-29 10:08:51 is exactly 1 day.\n   - From 10:08:51 to 14:02:04 on 2609-01-29 is 3 hours, 53 minutes, and 13 seconds.\n\n7. **Combine the Duration:**\n   - Total duration is 1 day, 3 hours, 53 minutes, and 13 seconds.\n\n8. **Format the Answer:**\n   - The question asks for the duration in the format D days, HH:MM.\n   - Therefore, we ignore the seconds and format the duration as 1 day, 03:53.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<1 day, 03:53>>>"
