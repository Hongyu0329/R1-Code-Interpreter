    "To determine the duration of the flight, we need to calculate the difference between the departure date and the arrival date. Here are the steps to find the answer:\n\n1. **Identify the Departure Date:**\n   - The flight departed on 03/10/2231. This means the departure date is March 10, 2231.\n\n2. **Identify the Arrival Date:**\n   - The flight arrived on 03/31/2231. This means the arrival date is March 31, 2231.\n\n3. **Understand the Month:**\n   - Both the departure and arrival dates are in the same month, March, of the year 2231.\n\n4. **Calculate the Duration:**\n   - Since both dates are in March, we can simply subtract the departure day from the arrival day to find the duration of the flight.\n   - Arrival day: 31\n   - Departure day: 10\n   - Duration = Arrival day - Departure day = 31 - 10 = 21 days\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The flight duration is 21 days.\n\nTherefore, the duration of the flight is <<<21 days>>>."
