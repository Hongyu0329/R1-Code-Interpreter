    "To determine the duration of the video call, we need to calculate the difference between the start time and the end time. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Times:**\n   - Start Time: 12:32:23\n   - End Time: 14:58:48\n\n2. **Convert Times to Seconds:**\n   - Convert both the start and end times into total seconds from the start of the day (00:00:00) to make the calculation easier.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Seconds for Start Time:**\n   - Hours: 12 hours = 12 * 3600 = 43,200 seconds\n   - Minutes: 32 minutes = 32 * 60 = 1,920 seconds\n   - Seconds: 23 seconds\n   - Total for Start Time: 43,200 + 1,920 + 23 = 45,143 seconds\n\n4. **Calculate Total Seconds for End Time:**\n   - Hours: 14 hours = 14 * 3600 = 50,400 seconds\n   - Minutes: 58 minutes = 58 * 60 = 3,480 seconds\n   - Seconds: 48 seconds\n   - Total for End Time: 50,400 + 3,480 + 48 = 53,928 seconds\n\n5. **Calculate the Difference in Seconds:**\n   - Difference = Total End Time Seconds - Total Start Time Seconds\n   - Difference = 53,928 - 45,143 = 8,785 seconds\n\n6. **Convert the Difference Back to HH:MM:SS:**\n   - Hours: 8,785 seconds รท 3600 = 2 hours (with a remainder)\n   - Remaining Seconds: 8,785 - (2 * 3600) = 2,585 seconds\n   - Minutes: 2,585 seconds รท 60 = 43 minutes (with a remainder)\n   - Remaining Seconds: 2,585 - (43 * 60) = 5 seconds\n\n7. **Compile the Final Duration:**\n   - The call lasted for 2 hours, 26 minutes, and 25 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the duration of the video call is:\n\n<<<02:26:25>>>"
