    "To determine the duration of the flight in days, we need to calculate the difference between the departure date and the arrival date. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Departure Date:**\n   - The flight departed on August 25, 2804.\n\n2. **Identify the Arrival Date:**\n   - The flight arrived on November 11, 2804.\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Days in Each Month:**\n   - August has 31 days.\n   - September has 30 days.\n   - October has 31 days.\n   - November has 30 days.\n\n4. **Calculate the Days Remaining in August:**\n   - The flight departed on August 25, so there are 31 - 25 = 6 days remaining in August.\n\n5. **Calculate the Days in September:**\n   - September has 30 days.\n\n6. **Calculate the Days in October:**\n   - October has 31 days.\n\n7. **Calculate the Days in November up to the Arrival Date:**\n   - The flight arrived on November 11, so there are 11 days in November.\n\n8. **Sum the Days to Find the Total Duration:**\n   - Days remaining in August: 6 days\n   - Days in September: 30 days\n   - Days in October: 31 days\n   - Days in November: 11 days\n\n   Total duration = 6 + 30 + 31 + 11 = 78 days\n\nTherefore, the flight duration is 78 days.\n\nThe final answer is enclosed within triple angle brackets: <<<78 days>>>."
