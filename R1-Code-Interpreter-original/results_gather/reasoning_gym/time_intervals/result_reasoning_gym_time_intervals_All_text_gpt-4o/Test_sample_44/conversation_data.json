    "To determine the duration of the meeting, we need to calculate the difference between the start time and the end time. The times are given in the format HH:MM:SS.mmm, where HH is hours, MM is minutes, SS is seconds, and mmm is milliseconds.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Times:**\n   - Start Time: 14:24:12.054\n   - End Time: 19:48:35.482\n\n2. **Break Down the Times into Components:**\n   - Start Time: \n     - Hours: 14\n     - Minutes: 24\n     - Seconds: 12\n     - Milliseconds: 054\n   - End Time:\n     - Hours: 19\n     - Minutes: 48\n     - Seconds: 35\n     - Milliseconds: 482\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference in Milliseconds:**\n   - End Milliseconds: 482\n   - Start Milliseconds: 054\n   - Difference: 482 - 054 = 428 milliseconds\n\n4. **Calculate the Difference in Seconds:**\n   - End Seconds: 35\n   - Start Seconds: 12\n   - Difference: 35 - 12 = 23 seconds\n\n5. **Calculate the Difference in Minutes:**\n   - End Minutes: 48\n   - Start Minutes: 24\n   - Difference: 48 - 24 = 24 minutes\n\n6. **Calculate the Difference in Hours:**\n   - End Hours: 19\n   - Start Hours: 14\n   - Difference: 19 - 14 = 5 hours\n\n7. **Combine the Differences:**\n   - Hours: 5\n   - Minutes: 24\n   - Seconds: 23\n   - Milliseconds: 428\n\nThus, the duration of the meeting is 5 hours, 24 minutes, 23 seconds, and 428 milliseconds.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<05:24:23.428>>>"
