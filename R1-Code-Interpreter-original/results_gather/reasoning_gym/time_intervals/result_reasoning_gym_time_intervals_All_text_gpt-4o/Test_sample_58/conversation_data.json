    "To determine the duration of the conference call, we need to calculate the difference between the start time and the end time. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Times:**\n   - Start Time: 22:05:30\n   - End Time: 23:35:33\n\n2. **Calculate the Difference in Seconds:**\n   - Start Time in seconds: (22 * 3600) + (5 * 60) + 30 = 79530 seconds\n   - End Time in seconds: (23 * 3600) + (35 * 60) + 33 = 84933 seconds\n\n3. **Find the Total Duration in Seconds:**\n   - Duration in seconds = End Time in seconds - Start Time in seconds\n   - Duration in seconds = 84933 - 79530 = 5403 seconds\n\n4. **Convert the Duration from Seconds to HH:MM:SS:**\n   - Calculate hours: 5403 seconds รท 3600 seconds/hour = 1 hour (with a remainder)\n   - Calculate remaining seconds after hours: 5403 - (1 * 3600) = 1803 seconds\n   - Calculate minutes: 1803 seconds รท 60 seconds/minute = 30 minutes (with a remainder)\n   - Calculate remaining seconds after minutes: 1803 - (30 * 60) = 3 seconds\n\n5. **Compile the Duration:**\n   - The duration of the conference call is 1 hour, 30 minutes, and 3 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the duration of the conference call is <<<01:30:03>>>."
