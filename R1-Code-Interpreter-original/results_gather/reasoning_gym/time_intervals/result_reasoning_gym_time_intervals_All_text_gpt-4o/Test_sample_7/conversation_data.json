    "To determine the duration of the meeting, we need to calculate the difference between the start time and the end time. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Times:**\n   - Start Time: 08:24:01\n   - End Time: 11:57:05\n\n2. **Convert Times to Seconds:**\n   - Convert both the start and end times into total seconds from the start of the day (00:00:00) for easier calculation.\n\n   - **Start Time in Seconds:**\n     - Hours: 8 hours = 8 * 3600 seconds = 28800 seconds\n     - Minutes: 24 minutes = 24 * 60 seconds = 1440 seconds\n     - Seconds: 1 second = 1 second\n     - Total Start Time in Seconds = 28800 + 1440 + 1 = 30241 seconds\n\n   - **End Time in Seconds:**\n     - Hours: 11 hours = 11 * 3600 seconds = 39600 seconds\n     - Minutes: 57 minutes = 57 * 60 seconds = 3420 seconds\n     - Seconds: 5 seconds = 5 seconds\n     - Total End Time in Seconds = 39600 + 3420 + 5 = 43025 seconds\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference in Seconds:**\n   - Difference in Seconds = Total End Time in Seconds - Total Start Time in Seconds\n   - Difference in Seconds = 43025 - 30241 = 12784 seconds\n\n4. **Convert the Difference Back to HH:MM:SS:**\n   - **Hours:**\n     - 1 hour = 3600 seconds\n     - Hours = 12784 seconds รท 3600 seconds/hour = 3 hours (with a remainder)\n   \n   - **Minutes:**\n     - Remaining Seconds = 12784 - (3 * 3600) = 3984 seconds\n     - 1 minute = 60 seconds\n     - Minutes = 3984 seconds รท 60 seconds/minute = 66 minutes (with a remainder)\n     - Since 66 minutes is more than an hour, convert 60 minutes to 1 hour and add to the hours.\n     - Adjusted Hours = 3 + 1 = 4 hours\n     - Adjusted Minutes = 66 - 60 = 6 minutes\n\n   - **Seconds:**\n     - Remaining Seconds = 3984 - (66 * 60) = 24 seconds\n\n5. **Compile the Final Duration:**\n   - The meeting lasted for 3 hours, 33 minutes, and 4 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the duration of the meeting is:\n\n<<<03:33:04>>>"
