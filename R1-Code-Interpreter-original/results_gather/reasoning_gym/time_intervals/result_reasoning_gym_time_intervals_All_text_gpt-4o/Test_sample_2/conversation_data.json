    "To determine the duration of the flight, we need to calculate the difference between the departure and arrival times. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Departure and Arrival Dates and Times:**\n   - Departure: Monday, March 2, 2229, at 00:56:24\n   - Arrival: Friday, April 17, 2229, at 03:17:28\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Days Between the Two Dates:**\n   - March 2 to March 31: 31 - 2 = 29 days (since March has 31 days)\n   - April 1 to April 17: 17 days\n   - Total days from March 2 to April 17: 29 + 17 = 46 days\n\n3. **Calculate the Time Difference on the Last Day:**\n   - Departure time on March 2: 00:56:24\n   - Arrival time on April 17: 03:17:28\n\n4. **Calculate the Time Difference:**\n   - From 00:56:24 to 03:17:28 on the same day:\n     - Hours: 03 - 00 = 3 hours\n     - Minutes: 17 - 56 = -39 minutes (since 17 is less than 56, we need to borrow 1 hour)\n     - Adjusted Minutes: 60 - 56 + 17 = 21 minutes (after borrowing 1 hour)\n     - Seconds: 28 - 24 = 4 seconds\n\n5. **Adjust the Time Calculation:**\n   - Since we borrowed 1 hour to adjust the minutes, the hours become 2 hours.\n   - Therefore, the time difference on the last day is 2 hours and 21 minutes.\n\n6. **Combine the Days and Time:**\n   - Total duration: 46 days + 2 hours and 21 minutes\n\n7. **Format the Answer:**\n   - The flight duration is 46 days, 02:21.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<46 days, 02:21>>>"
