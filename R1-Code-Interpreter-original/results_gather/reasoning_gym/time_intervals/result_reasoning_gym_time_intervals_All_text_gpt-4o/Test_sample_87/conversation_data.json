    "To determine the total backup duration, we need to calculate the difference between the start time and the end time. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Times:**\n   - Start Time: 05:47:50.551\n   - End Time: 22:45:21.232\n\n2. **Convert Times to Milliseconds:**\n   - Convert each component of the time (hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds) to milliseconds for easier calculation.\n\n3. **Calculate Start Time in Milliseconds:**\n   - Hours: 5 hours = 5 * 60 * 60 * 1000 = 18,000,000 milliseconds\n   - Minutes: 47 minutes = 47 * 60 * 1000 = 2,820,000 milliseconds\n   - Seconds: 50 seconds = 50 * 1000 = 50,000 milliseconds\n   - Milliseconds: 551 milliseconds\n   - Total Start Time in Milliseconds = 18,000,000 + 2,820,000 + 50,000 + 551 = 20,870,551 milliseconds\n\n4. **Calculate End Time in Milliseconds:**\n   - Hours: 22 hours = 22 * 60 * 60 * 1000 = 79,200,000 milliseconds\n   - Minutes: 45 minutes = 45 * 60 * 1000 = 2,700,000 milliseconds\n   - Seconds: 21 seconds = 21 * 1000 = 21,000 milliseconds\n   - Milliseconds: 232 milliseconds\n   - Total End Time in Milliseconds = 79,200,000 + 2,700,000 + 21,000 + 232 = 81,921,232 milliseconds\n\n5. **Calculate the Duration in Milliseconds:**\n   - Duration in Milliseconds = End Time in Milliseconds - Start Time in Milliseconds\n   - Duration in Milliseconds = 81,921,232 - 20,870,551 = 61,050,681 milliseconds\n\n6. **Convert Duration Back to HH:MM:SS.mmm:**\n   - Hours: 61,050,681 milliseconds / (60 * 60 * 1000) = 16 hours\n   - Remaining Milliseconds: 61,050,681 - (16 * 60 * 60 * 1000) = 3,050,681 milliseconds\n   - Minutes: 3,050,681 milliseconds / (60 * 1000) = 50 minutes\n   - Remaining Milliseconds: 3,050,681 - (50 * 60 * 1000) = 50,681 milliseconds\n   - Seconds: 50,681 milliseconds / 1000 = 50 seconds\n   - Remaining Milliseconds: 50,681 - (50 * 1000) = 681 milliseconds\n\n7. **Compile the Final Duration:**\n   - The total backup duration is 16 hours, 57 minutes, 30 seconds, and 681 milliseconds.\n\nTherefore, the total backup duration is <<<16:57:30.681>>>."
