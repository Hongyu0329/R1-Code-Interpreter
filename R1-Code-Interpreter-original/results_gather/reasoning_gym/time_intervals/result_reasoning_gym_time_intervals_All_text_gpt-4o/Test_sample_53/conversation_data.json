    "To determine how long the database query took, we need to calculate the difference between the start time and the end time. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Times:**\n   - Start Time: 22:39:52\n   - End Time: 22:54:30\n\n2. **Convert Times to Seconds:**\n   - Convert both the start and end times into total seconds from the start of the day (00:00:00) to make the calculation easier.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Seconds for Start Time:**\n   - Hours: 22 hours = 22 * 3600 seconds = 79,200 seconds\n   - Minutes: 39 minutes = 39 * 60 seconds = 2,340 seconds\n   - Seconds: 52 seconds\n   - Total for Start Time: 79,200 + 2,340 + 52 = 81,592 seconds\n\n4. **Calculate Total Seconds for End Time:**\n   - Hours: 22 hours = 22 * 3600 seconds = 79,200 seconds\n   - Minutes: 54 minutes = 54 * 60 seconds = 3,240 seconds\n   - Seconds: 30 seconds\n   - Total for End Time: 79,200 + 3,240 + 30 = 82,470 seconds\n\n5. **Calculate the Difference in Seconds:**\n   - Difference = End Time in seconds - Start Time in seconds\n   - Difference = 82,470 - 81,592 = 878 seconds\n\n6. **Convert the Difference Back to HH:MM:SS:**\n   - Hours: 878 seconds รท 3600 = 0 hours (since 878 is less than 3600)\n   - Remaining Seconds: 878 seconds\n   - Minutes: 878 รท 60 = 14 minutes\n   - Remaining Seconds: 878 - (14 * 60) = 878 - 840 = 38 seconds\n\n7. **Compile the Result:**\n   - The query took 0 hours, 14 minutes, and 38 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the duration of the query is:\n\n<<<00:14:38>>>"
