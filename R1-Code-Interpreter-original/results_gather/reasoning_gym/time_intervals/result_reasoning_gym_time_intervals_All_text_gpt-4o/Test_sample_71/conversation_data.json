    "To determine the duration of the video call, we need to carefully analyze the given start and end times, taking into account the time zones and the differences in dates and times. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Times:**\n   - Start: 23 February 2889, 02:58 +0800\n   - End: 28 May 2889, 07:24 +0000\n\n2. **Convert Start Time to UTC:**\n   - The start time is given in the +0800 time zone, which means it is 8 hours ahead of UTC.\n   - To convert the start time to UTC, subtract 8 hours from the given time.\n   - Start time in UTC: 23 February 2889, 02:58 - 8 hours = 22 February 2889, 18:58 UTC\n\n3. **End Time is Already in UTC:**\n   - The end time is given in the +0000 time zone, which is UTC.\n   - End time in UTC: 28 May 2889, 07:24 UTC\n\n4. **Calculate the Duration:**\n   - Now, we need to calculate the difference between the start and end times, both in UTC.\n   - Start: 22 February 2889, 18:58 UTC\n   - End: 28 May 2889, 07:24 UTC\n\n5. **Break Down the Calculation:**\n   - **From 22 February to 28 February:**\n     - 22 February, 18:58 to 28 February, 18:58 = 6 days\n   - **From 28 February to 28 May:**\n     - March has 31 days, April has 30 days, and May has 28 days up to the 28th.\n     - Total days from 28 February to 28 May = 31 (March) + 30 (April) + 28 (May) = 89 days\n   - **Total Days:**\n     - 6 days (from February) + 89 days (from March to May) = 95 days\n   - **Calculate the Remaining Time on 28 May:**\n     - From 18:58 on 28 February to 07:24 on 28 May:\n     - 18:58 to 07:24 is 12 hours and 26 minutes backward, which means we need to subtract this from a full day (24 hours).\n     - 24 hours - 12 hours 26 minutes = 11 hours 34 minutes\n\n6. **Combine the Total Duration:**\n   - Total duration = 95 days + 11 hours 34 minutes\n\nTherefore, the duration of the call is:\n\n<<<95 days, 11:34>>>"
