    "To determine the operation duration, we need to calculate the time difference between the start and end timestamps. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Timestamps:**\n   - Start: Fri Nov 07 1902 09:33:49\n   - End: Mon Jan 19 1903 21:44:59\n\n2. **Break Down the Dates:**\n   - Start Date: November 7, 1902\n   - End Date: January 19, 1903\n\n3. **Calculate the Number of Days Between the Dates:**\n   - November 7, 1902, to November 30, 1902: 23 days (since November has 30 days)\n   - December 1, 1902, to December 31, 1902: 31 days\n   - January 1, 1903, to January 19, 1903: 19 days\n\n   Total days from November 7, 1902, to January 19, 1903: 23 + 31 + 19 = 73 days\n\n4. **Calculate the Time Difference on the Last Day:**\n   - Start Time: 09:33:49\n   - End Time: 21:44:59\n\n   To find the time difference on January 19, 1903:\n   - Hours: 21 - 9 = 12 hours\n   - Minutes: 44 - 33 = 11 minutes\n   - Seconds: 59 - 49 = 10 seconds\n\n   Since the seconds and minutes are positive, we don't need to adjust the hours.\n\n5. **Combine the Days and Time:**\n   - Total Duration: 73 days, 12 hours, 11 minutes, and 10 seconds\n\n6. **Format the Answer:**\n   - The question asks for the duration in the format D days, HH:MM. We will ignore the seconds as they are not required in the final answer.\n\n   Therefore, the operation duration is 73 days, 12:11.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<73 days, 12:11>>>"
