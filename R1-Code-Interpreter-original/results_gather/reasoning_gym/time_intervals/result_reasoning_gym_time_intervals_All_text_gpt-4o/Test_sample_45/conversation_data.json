    "To calculate the time difference between two timestamps, we need to perform a step-by-step subtraction of each component: hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Identify the components of each timestamp:**\n   - Start time: 10:12:15.842\n     - Hours: 10\n     - Minutes: 12\n     - Seconds: 15\n     - Milliseconds: 842\n   - End time: 13:43:13.804\n     - Hours: 13\n     - Minutes: 43\n     - Seconds: 13\n     - Milliseconds: 804\n\n2. **Subtract the milliseconds:**\n   - End milliseconds: 804\n   - Start milliseconds: 842\n   - Since 804 is less than 842, we need to borrow 1 second (1000 milliseconds) from the seconds component of the end time.\n   - New end milliseconds: 804 + 1000 = 1804\n   - Subtract: 1804 - 842 = 962 milliseconds\n\n3. **Subtract the seconds:**\n   - End seconds (after borrowing): 13 - 1 = 12\n   - Start seconds: 15\n   - Since 12 is less than 15, we need to borrow 1 minute (60 seconds) from the minutes component of the end time.\n   - New end seconds: 12 + 60 = 72\n   - Subtract: 72 - 15 = 57 seconds\n\n4. **Subtract the minutes:**\n   - End minutes (after borrowing): 43 - 1 = 42\n   - Start minutes: 12\n   - Subtract: 42 - 12 = 30 minutes\n\n5. **Subtract the hours:**\n   - End hours: 13\n   - Start hours: 10\n   - Subtract: 13 - 10 = 3 hours\n\n6. **Combine the results:**\n   - Hours: 3\n   - Minutes: 30\n   - Seconds: 57\n   - Milliseconds: 962\n\nTherefore, the time difference between 10:12:15.842 and 13:43:13.804 is 3 hours, 30 minutes, 57 seconds, and 962 milliseconds.\n\nFinal answer: <<<03:30:57.962>>>"
