    "To calculate the time difference between two given times, 23:12:56 and 23:49:51, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Components**: \n   - Start Time: 23:12:56\n     - Hours: 23\n     - Minutes: 12\n     - Seconds: 56\n   - End Time: 23:49:51\n     - Hours: 23\n     - Minutes: 49\n     - Seconds: 51\n\n2. **Calculate the Difference in Seconds**:\n   - Subtract the seconds of the start time from the seconds of the end time.\n   - 51 (end seconds) - 56 (start seconds) = -5 seconds.\n   - Since the result is negative, we need to borrow 1 minute (60 seconds) from the minutes.\n\n3. **Adjust for Borrowing**:\n   - Borrow 1 minute from the end time's minutes, converting it to 60 seconds.\n   - New end seconds: 51 + 60 = 111 seconds.\n   - Now, calculate the seconds difference again: 111 - 56 = 55 seconds.\n\n4. **Calculate the Difference in Minutes**:\n   - After borrowing, the end time's minutes are reduced by 1.\n   - New end minutes: 49 - 1 = 48 minutes.\n   - Subtract the start minutes from the adjusted end minutes.\n   - 48 (end minutes) - 12 (start minutes) = 36 minutes.\n\n5. **Calculate the Difference in Hours**:\n   - Since the hours are the same for both times (23), the difference in hours is 0.\n\n6. **Compile the Results**:\n   - Hours: 0\n   - Minutes: 36\n   - Seconds: 55\n\nTherefore, the time difference between 23:12:56 and 23:49:51 is 0 hours, 36 minutes, and 55 seconds.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<00:36:55>>>."
