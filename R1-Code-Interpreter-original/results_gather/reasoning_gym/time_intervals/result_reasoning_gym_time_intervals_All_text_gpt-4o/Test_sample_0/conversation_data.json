    "To determine the duration of the meeting, we need to calculate the difference between the start time and the end time. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Times:**\n   - Start Time: 06:09\n   - End Time: 18:52\n\n2. **Convert Times to a 24-Hour Format:**\n   - The times are already in 24-hour format, so no conversion is necessary.\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference in Hours:**\n   - The start hour is 06, and the end hour is 18.\n   - Calculate the difference in hours: 18 - 06 = 12 hours.\n\n4. **Calculate the Difference in Minutes:**\n   - The start minute is 09, and the end minute is 52.\n   - Calculate the difference in minutes: 52 - 09 = 43 minutes.\n\n5. **Combine the Differences:**\n   - The total duration of the meeting is 12 hours and 43 minutes.\n\n6. **Format the Answer:**\n   - The duration should be expressed in HH:MM format, which is 12:43.\n\nBy following these steps, we have determined the duration of the meeting.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<12:43>>>."
