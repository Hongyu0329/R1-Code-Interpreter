    "To determine the duration of the conference call, we need to calculate the difference between the start time and the end time. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Times:**\n   - Start Time: 18:06:21\n   - End Time: 20:19:20\n\n2. **Convert Both Times to Seconds:**\n   - Convert the start time to seconds:\n     - Hours to seconds: 18 hours * 3600 seconds/hour = 64,800 seconds\n     - Minutes to seconds: 6 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 360 seconds\n     - Seconds: 21 seconds\n     - Total start time in seconds = 64,800 + 360 + 21 = 65,181 seconds\n\n   - Convert the end time to seconds:\n     - Hours to seconds: 20 hours * 3600 seconds/hour = 72,000 seconds\n     - Minutes to seconds: 19 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 1,140 seconds\n     - Seconds: 20 seconds\n     - Total end time in seconds = 72,000 + 1,140 + 20 = 73,160 seconds\n\n3. **Calculate the Difference in Seconds:**\n   - Difference in seconds = Total end time in seconds - Total start time in seconds\n   - Difference in seconds = 73,160 - 65,181 = 7,979 seconds\n\n4. **Convert the Difference Back to HH:MM:SS:**\n   - Calculate hours: 7,979 seconds รท 3600 seconds/hour = 2 hours (with a remainder)\n   - Calculate remaining seconds after hours: 7,979 - (2 * 3600) = 779 seconds\n   - Calculate minutes: 779 seconds รท 60 seconds/minute = 12 minutes (with a remainder)\n   - Calculate remaining seconds after minutes: 779 - (12 * 60) = 59 seconds\n\n5. **Compile the Duration:**\n   - The duration of the conference call is 2 hours, 12 minutes, and 59 seconds.\n\nTherefore, the duration of the conference call is <<<02:12:59>>>."
