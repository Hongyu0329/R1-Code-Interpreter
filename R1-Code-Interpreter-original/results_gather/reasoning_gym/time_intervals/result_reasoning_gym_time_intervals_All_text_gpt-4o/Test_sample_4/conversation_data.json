    "To determine the duration between the two given times, we need to perform a step-by-step subtraction of the start time from the end time. The times provided are in the format HH:MM:SS.mmm, which includes hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.\n\n1. **Identify the Start and End Times:**\n   - Start Time: 01:01:51.896\n   - End Time: 11:23:19.976\n\n2. **Break Down the Times into Components:**\n   - Start Time: \n     - Hours: 01\n     - Minutes: 01\n     - Seconds: 51\n     - Milliseconds: 896\n   - End Time:\n     - Hours: 11\n     - Minutes: 23\n     - Seconds: 19\n     - Milliseconds: 976\n\n3. **Subtract Milliseconds:**\n   - End Milliseconds: 976\n   - Start Milliseconds: 896\n   - Subtraction: 976 - 896 = 80 milliseconds\n\n4. **Subtract Seconds:**\n   - End Seconds: 19\n   - Start Seconds: 51\n   - Since 19 is less than 51, we need to borrow 1 minute (60 seconds) from the minutes.\n   - Adjusted End Seconds: 19 + 60 = 79\n   - Subtraction: 79 - 51 = 28 seconds\n\n5. **Subtract Minutes:**\n   - End Minutes: 23 (after borrowing 1 minute, it becomes 22)\n   - Start Minutes: 01\n   - Subtraction: 22 - 01 = 21 minutes\n\n6. **Subtract Hours:**\n   - End Hours: 11\n   - Start Hours: 01\n   - Subtraction: 11 - 01 = 10 hours\n\n7. **Combine the Results:**\n   - Hours: 10\n   - Minutes: 21\n   - Seconds: 28\n   - Milliseconds: 80\n\nThe duration between the two times is 10 hours, 21 minutes, 28 seconds, and 80 milliseconds.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<10:21:28.080>>>"
