For example: \"-0.3773, 0.4005\"\n2. For solutions that can be expressed in exact form (like \"u = 2 + sqrt(4560)/172\" and \"u = 2 - sqrt(4560)/172\"), convert them to decimal form in your final answer.\n3. If there are no real values that satisfy the equation, report your answer as an empty string: \"\"\n4. Format your answer based on the number of solutions:\n   - For 1 solution: a single decimal number\n   - For 2 solutions: two comma-separated decimal numbers\n   - For 3 or more solutions: all values as comma-separated decimal numbers\n   - Enclose the answer within triple angle brackets, like <<<number/numbers>>>.\n5. Round all decimal values to 4 decimal places (rounding down when the 5th decimal place is 5 or greater).\n",

    "To solve the equation \\(52h - 72 = 0\\), we need to isolate \\(h\\). Let's go through the steps:\n\n1. Start with the equation:  \n   \\(52h - 72 = 0\\)\n\n2. Add 72 to both sides to isolate the term with \\(h\\):  \n   \\(52h = 72\\)\n\n3. Divide both sides by 52 to solve for \\(h\\):  \n   \\(h = \\frac{72}{52}\\)\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of \\(h\\) using Python to ensure accuracy and to round the result to four decimal places.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of h\nh = 72 / 52\n\n# Round the result to four decimal places\nh_rounded = round(h, 4)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(h_rounded)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, we will have the value of \\(h\\) rounded to four decimal places.",
    "The code execution has provided the value of \\( h \\) as 1.3846. This is the solution to the equation \\( 52h - 72 = 0 \\).\n\nFollowing the instructions for formatting the answer, since there is only one solution, we present it as a single decimal number.\n\n<<<1.3846>>>"
