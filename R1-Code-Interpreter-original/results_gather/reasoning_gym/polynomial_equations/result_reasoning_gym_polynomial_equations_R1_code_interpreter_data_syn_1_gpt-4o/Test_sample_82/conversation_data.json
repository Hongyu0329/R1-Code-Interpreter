    "To solve the equation \\(86h^3 + 81h^2 = 0\\), we can start by factoring out the common term. The equation can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[ h^2(86h + 81) = 0 \\]\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions:\n\n1. \\( h^2 = 0 \\)\n2. \\( 86h + 81 = 0 \\)\n\nLet's solve these equations:\n\n1. \\( h^2 = 0 \\) implies \\( h = 0 \\).\n\n2. \\( 86h + 81 = 0 \\) can be solved for \\( h \\) as follows:\n\n\\[ 86h = -81 \\]\n\\[ h = -\\frac{81}{86} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the decimal value of \\(-\\frac{81}{86}\\) and round it to four decimal places.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the decimal value of -81/86\nh_value = -81 / 86\n# Round the result to four decimal places\nrounded_h_value = round(h_value, 4)\nprint(rounded_h_value)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the decimal value for the second solution. The solutions to the equation are \\( h = 0 \\) and the calculated decimal value. Let's proceed to the final answer.",
    "The solutions to the equation \\(86h^3 + 81h^2 = 0\\) are:\n\n1. \\( h = 0 \\)\n2. \\( h = -0.9419 \\)\n\nBoth solutions are real numbers. Therefore, the final answer, with the solutions rounded to four decimal places, is:\n\n<<<0.0000, -0.9419>>>"
