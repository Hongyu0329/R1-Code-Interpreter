    "To solve the polynomial equation \\(34 - 154g = 0\\) for real \\(g\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Rearrange the equation to isolate \\(g\\):\n   \\[\n   154g = 34\n   \\]\n\n2. Solve for \\(g\\) by dividing both sides by 154:\n   \\[\n   g = \\frac{34}{154}\n   \\]\n\n3. Simplify the fraction and convert it to a decimal.\n\nLet's calculate the decimal value using Python to ensure accuracy and proper rounding.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of g\ng = 34 / 154\n\n# Round the result to 4 decimal places\ng_rounded = round(g, 4)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(g_rounded)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will obtain the value of \\(g\\) rounded to four decimal places.",
    "The code execution has provided the value of \\(g\\) as 0.2208. This is the solution to the equation \\(34 - 154g = 0\\).\n\nBased on the instructions, since there is only one solution, we format the answer as a single decimal number.\n\n<<<0.2208>>>"
