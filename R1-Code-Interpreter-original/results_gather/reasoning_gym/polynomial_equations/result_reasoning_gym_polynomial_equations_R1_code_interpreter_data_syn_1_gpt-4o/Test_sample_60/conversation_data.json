    "To solve the equation \\(27p^3 + 10p^2 - 81 = 0\\), we need to find the real roots of this cubic equation. The general approach involves using numerical methods or specialized functions to find the roots of the polynomial. \n\nLet's proceed with the following steps:\n\n1. **Identify the polynomial**: The polynomial is \\(27p^3 + 10p^2 - 81\\).\n2. **Use numerical methods**: We can use Python's `numpy` library, which provides a function `numpy.roots()` to find the roots of a polynomial.\n3. **Filter real roots**: Since we are only interested in real roots, we will filter out any complex roots.\n4. **Round the results**: Finally, we will round the real roots to four decimal places.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Coefficients of the polynomial 27p^3 + 10p^2 - 81 = 0\ncoefficients = [27, 10, 0, -81]\n\n# Find the roots of the polynomial\nroots = np.roots(coefficients)\n\n# Filter real roots and round them to 4 decimal places\nreal_roots = [round(root.real, 4) for root in roots if np.isreal(root)]\n\n# Print the real roots as a comma-separated string\nprint(\",\".join(map(str, real_roots)))\n```\n\nThis code will compute the roots of the polynomial, filter out the real roots, and round them to four decimal places. Let's execute this code to find the solution.",
    "The code execution has provided us with a single real root for the equation \\(27p^3 + 10p^2 - 81 = 0\\). The root is approximately 1.3288 when rounded to four decimal places.\n\nBased on the instructions, since there is only one real solution, we should format the answer as a single decimal number.\n\n<<<1.3288>>>"
