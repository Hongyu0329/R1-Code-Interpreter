    "To solve the polynomial equation \\(52c^3 - 96c = 0\\), we can start by factoring the equation. \n\nFirst, notice that we can factor out a common term, \\(c\\), from the equation:\n\n\\[ c(52c^2 - 96) = 0 \\]\n\nThis gives us two separate equations to solve:\n\n1. \\( c = 0 \\)\n2. \\( 52c^2 - 96 = 0 \\)\n\nThe first equation, \\( c = 0 \\), is straightforward and gives us one solution: \\( c = 0 \\).\n\nFor the second equation, \\( 52c^2 - 96 = 0 \\), we can solve for \\( c^2 \\):\n\n\\[ 52c^2 = 96 \\]\n\n\\[ c^2 = \\frac{96}{52} \\]\n\n\\[ c^2 = \\frac{24}{13} \\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\n\\[ c = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{24}{13}} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the decimal values for these solutions. We will use Python to compute these values and ensure they are rounded to four decimal places.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the square root of 24/13\nc1 = math.sqrt(24/13)\nc2 = -math.sqrt(24/13)\n\n# Round the results to four decimal places\nc1_rounded = round(c1, 4)\nc2_rounded = round(c2, 4)\n\n# Print the solutions\nprint(0, c1_rounded, c2_rounded)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the decimal values for the solutions.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the solutions to the polynomial equation. We have three solutions: \\( c = 0 \\), \\( c = 1.3587 \\), and \\( c = -1.3587 \\). These are the real values that satisfy the equation \\( 52c^3 - 96c = 0 \\).\n\nNow, let's format the final answer according to the instructions:\n\n<<<0, 1.3587, -1.3587>>>"
