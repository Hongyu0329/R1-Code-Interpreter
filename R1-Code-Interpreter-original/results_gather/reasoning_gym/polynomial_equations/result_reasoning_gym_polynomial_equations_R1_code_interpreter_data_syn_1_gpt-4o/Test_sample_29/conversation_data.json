    "To solve the equation \\(-64r - 4 = 0\\), we need to isolate the variable \\(r\\). Here is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with the equation: \n   \\[\n   -64r - 4 = 0\n   \\]\n\n2. Add 4 to both sides to isolate the term with \\(r\\):\n   \\[\n   -64r = 4\n   \\]\n\n3. Divide both sides by -64 to solve for \\(r\\):\n   \\[\n   r = \\frac{4}{-64}\n   \\]\n\n4. Simplify the fraction:\n   \\[\n   r = -\\frac{1}{16}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's convert this fraction to a decimal and round it to four decimal places. We can use Python to perform this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of r\nr = 4 / -64\n# Print the result rounded to four decimal places\nprint(round(r, 4))\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will obtain the decimal value of \\(r\\). Let's proceed with the calculation.",
    "The calculation has been completed successfully, and the value of \\( r \\) is \\(-0.0625\\). This is the only solution to the equation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-0.0625>>>"
