    "To solve the cubic equation \\(-29g^3 + 45g^2 - 88g + 99 = 0\\), we need to find the real roots. A cubic equation can have one, two, or three real roots. We will use numerical methods to find the roots of this equation.\n\nLet's proceed with the following steps:\n1. Use a numerical solver to find the roots of the cubic equation.\n2. Filter out the real roots from the complex ones.\n3. Round the real roots to four decimal places.\n4. Format the answer according to the instructions.\n\nWe'll use Python's `numpy` library to find the roots of the polynomial.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Coefficients of the polynomial -29g^3 + 45g^2 - 88g + 99\ncoefficients = [-29, 45, -88, 99]\n\n# Find the roots of the polynomial\nroots = np.roots(coefficients)\n\n# Filter real roots and round them to 4 decimal places\nreal_roots = [round(root.real, 4) for root in roots if np.isreal(root)]\n\n# Print the real roots as a comma-separated string\nprint(\",\".join(map(str, real_roots)))\n```\n\nThis code will compute the roots of the polynomial and output the real roots rounded to four decimal places. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code execution has provided us with one real root for the cubic equation \\(-29g^3 + 45g^2 - 88g + 99 = 0\\). The root is approximately 1.2737 when rounded to four decimal places.\n\nAccording to the instructions, since there is only one real solution, we should present it as a single decimal number.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1.2737>>>"
