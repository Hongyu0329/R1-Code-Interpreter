    "To solve the quadratic equation \\(68u^2 - 19u - 88 = 0\\), we can use the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[ u = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nwhere \\(a = 68\\), \\(b = -19\\), and \\(c = -88\\).\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the discriminant \\(b^2 - 4ac\\) to determine the nature of the roots. If the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots. If it is zero, there is one real root. If it is negative, there are no real roots.\n\nLet's calculate the discriminant and then find the roots using the quadratic formula.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coefficients\na = 68\nb = -19\nc = -88\n\n# Calculate the discriminant\ndiscriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c\n\n# Calculate the roots if the discriminant is non-negative\nif discriminant >= 0:\n    root1 = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)\n    root2 = (-b - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)\n    # Round the roots to 4 decimal places\n    root1 = round(root1, 4)\n    root2 = round(root2, 4)\n    print(f\"{root1}, {root2}\")\nelse:\n    # No real roots\n    print(\"\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the roots of the equation.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the roots of the quadratic equation. The roots are real and distinct, as indicated by the positive discriminant. The roots have been rounded to four decimal places as required.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1.2858, -1.0064>>>"
