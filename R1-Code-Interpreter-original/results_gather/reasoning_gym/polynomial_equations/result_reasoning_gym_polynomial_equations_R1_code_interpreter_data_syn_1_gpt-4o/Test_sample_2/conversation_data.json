    "To solve the equation \\(26 - 50s^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Rearrange the equation to isolate the term with \\(s\\):\n   \\[\n   50s^2 = 26\n   \\]\n\n2. Divide both sides by 50 to solve for \\(s^2\\):\n   \\[\n   s^2 = \\frac{26}{50} = 0.52\n   \\]\n\n3. Take the square root of both sides to solve for \\(s\\):\n   \\[\n   s = \\pm \\sqrt{0.52}\n   \\]\n\n4. Calculate the square root of 0.52 to find the decimal values for \\(s\\).\n\nLet's compute the square root of 0.52 and round the results to four decimal places using Python.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the square roots\ns1 = math.sqrt(0.52)\ns2 = -math.sqrt(0.52)\n\n# Round the results to four decimal places\ns1_rounded = round(s1, 4)\ns2_rounded = round(s2, 4)\n\n# Print the results\nprint(s1_rounded, s2_rounded)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, we will have the decimal values for \\(s\\).",
    "The code execution has provided us with the two real solutions for the equation \\(26 - 50s^2 = 0\\). The solutions are \\(s = 0.7211\\) and \\(s = -0.7211\\).\n\nFollowing the instructions for formatting the answer, we present the two solutions as comma-separated decimal values rounded to four decimal places.\n\n<<<0.7211, -0.7211>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Solve for real s: 26 - 50*s**2 = 0\nIn solving equations, please follow these instructions:\n1.
