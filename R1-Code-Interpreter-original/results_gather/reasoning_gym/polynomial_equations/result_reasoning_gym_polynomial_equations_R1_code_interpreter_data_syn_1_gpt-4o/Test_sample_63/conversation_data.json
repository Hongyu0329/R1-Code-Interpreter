For example: \"-0.3773, 0.4005\"\n2. For solutions that can be expressed in exact form (like \"u = 2 + sqrt(4560)/172\" and \"u = 2 - sqrt(4560)/172\"), convert them to decimal form in your final answer.\n3. If there are no real values that satisfy the equation, report your answer as an empty string: \"\"\n4. Format your answer based on the number of solutions:\n   - For 1 solution: a single decimal number\n   - For 2 solutions: two comma-separated decimal numbers\n   - For 3 or more solutions: all values as comma-separated decimal numbers\n   - Enclose the answer within triple angle brackets, like <<<number/numbers>>>.\n5.

    "To solve the equation \\(-47s^3 - 50 = 0\\) for real \\(s\\), we can first isolate \\(s^3\\) and then solve for \\(s\\).\n\n1. Rearrange the equation to solve for \\(s^3\\):\n   \\[\n   -47s^3 = 50 \\implies s^3 = -\\frac{50}{47}\n   \\]\n\n2. Take the cube root of both sides to solve for \\(s\\):\n   \\[\n   s = \\sqrt[3]{-\\frac{50}{47}}\n   \\]\n\n3. Calculate the cube root to find the real solution.\n\nLet's compute this using Python to ensure accuracy and to get the decimal value rounded to four decimal places.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the cube root of -50/47\ns = (-50 / 47) ** (1/3)\n\n# Round the result to four decimal places\ns_rounded = round(s, 4)\n\nprint(s_rounded)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, we will have the real solution for \\(s\\).",
    "The error indicates that the result of the cube root calculation is a complex number, which suggests that there are no real solutions to the equation. This happens because the cube root of a negative number can result in a complex number when using certain computational methods.\n\nTo find the real cube root of a negative number, we should use a method that correctly handles negative inputs. Let's adjust the code to handle this:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the real cube root of -50/47\ns = -((-50 / 47) ** (1/3))\n\n# Round the result to four decimal places\ns_rounded = round(s, 4)\n\nprint(s_rounded)\n```\n\nThis code should correctly compute the real cube root of a negative number. Let's execute it to find the real solution.",
    "The error persists because the calculation is still resulting in a complex number. This suggests that the approach to compute the real cube root of a negative number needs to be adjusted. Let's use a different method to ensure we get the real cube root:\n\n```python\nimport cmath\n\n# Calculate the cube root of -50/47 using cmath to handle complex numbers\ns = cmath.exp(cmath.log(-50 / 47) / 3)\n\n# Extract the real part and round the result to four decimal places\ns_real = s.real\ns_rounded = round(s_real, 4)\n\nprint(s_rounded)\n```\n\nThis code uses the `cmath` library to handle the cube root of a negative number and extracts the real part of the result. Let's execute it to find the real solution.",
    "The output indicates that the real solution to the equation \\(-47s^3 - 50 = 0\\) is approximately \\(0.5104\\). This is the real cube root of \\(-\\frac{50}{47}\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0.5104>>>"
