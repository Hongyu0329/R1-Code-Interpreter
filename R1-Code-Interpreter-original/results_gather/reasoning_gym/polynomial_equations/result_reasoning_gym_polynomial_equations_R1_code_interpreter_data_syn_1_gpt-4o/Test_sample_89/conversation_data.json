For solutions that can be expressed in exact form (like \"u = 2 + sqrt(4560)/172\" and \"u = 2 - sqrt(4560)/172\"), convert them to decimal form in your final answer.\n3. If there are no real values that satisfy the equation, report your answer as an empty string: \"\"\n4. Format your answer based on the number of solutions:\n   - For 1 solution: a single decimal number\n   - For 2 solutions: two comma-separated decimal numbers\n   - For 3 or more solutions: all values as comma-separated decimal numbers\n   - Enclose the answer within triple angle brackets, like <<<number/numbers>>>.\n5.

    "To solve the equation \\(9 - 125c = 0\\), we need to isolate the variable \\(c\\). \n\n1. Start by moving the constant term to the other side of the equation:\n   \\[\n   9 = 125c\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, divide both sides by 125 to solve for \\(c\\):\n   \\[\n   c = \\frac{9}{125}\n   \\]\n\n3. Now, we need to convert this fraction to a decimal and round it to four decimal places.\n\nLet's calculate the decimal value of \\(\\frac{9}{125}\\) using Python to ensure accuracy and proper rounding.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of c\nc = 9 / 125\n\n# Round the result to four decimal places\nrounded_c = round(c, 4)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(rounded_c)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the decimal value of \\(c\\) rounded to four decimal places.",
    "The code execution has provided the value of \\(c\\) as 0.072, which is the solution to the equation \\(9 - 125c = 0\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0.072>>>"
