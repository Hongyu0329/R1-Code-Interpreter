For example: \"-0.3773, 0.4005\"\n2. For solutions that can be expressed in exact form (like \"u = 2 + sqrt(4560)/172\" and \"u = 2 - sqrt(4560)/172\"), convert them to decimal form in your final answer.\n3. If there are no real values that satisfy the equation, report your answer as an empty string: \"\"\n4. Format your answer based on the number of solutions:\n   - For 1 solution: a single decimal number\n   - For 2 solutions: two comma-separated decimal numbers\n   - For 3 or more solutions: all values as comma-separated decimal numbers\n   - Enclose the answer within triple angle brackets, like <<<number/numbers>>>.\n5. Round all decimal values to 4 decimal places (rounding down when the 5th decimal place is 5 or greater).\n",

    "To solve the equation \\( z^2 - 85z = 0 \\), we can factor the equation as follows:\n\n1. Factor out \\( z \\) from the equation:\n   \\[\n   z(z - 85) = 0\n   \\]\n\n2. Set each factor equal to zero:\n   \\[\n   z = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad z - 85 = 0\n   \\]\n\n3. Solve for \\( z \\) in each case:\n   - From \\( z = 0 \\), we have one solution: \\( z = 0 \\).\n   - From \\( z - 85 = 0 \\), we have another solution: \\( z = 85 \\).\n\nThus, the solutions to the equation are \\( z = 0 \\) and \\( z = 85 \\).\n\nNow, let's ensure these solutions are in the correct format and rounded to four decimal places. Since both solutions are integers, they are already in the correct format.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0.0000, 85.0000>>>"
