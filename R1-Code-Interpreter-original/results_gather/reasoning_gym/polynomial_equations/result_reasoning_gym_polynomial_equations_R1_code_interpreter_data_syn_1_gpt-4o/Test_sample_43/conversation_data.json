    "To solve the equation \\(181q^3 + 61 = 0\\), we need to find the real value(s) of \\(q\\).\n\nFirst, let's isolate \\(q^3\\) by moving 61 to the other side of the equation:\n\n\\[ 181q^3 = -61 \\]\n\nNext, divide both sides by 181 to solve for \\(q^3\\):\n\n\\[ q^3 = -\\frac{61}{181} \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the cube root of \\(-\\frac{61}{181}\\) to solve for \\(q\\). This will give us the real value of \\(q\\).\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure precision and rounding to four decimal places.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the cube root of -61/181\nq = (-61 / 181) ** (1/3)\n\n# Round the result to 4 decimal places\nq_rounded = round(q, 4)\n\nprint(q_rounded)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, we will have the real value of \\(q\\) rounded to four decimal places.",
    "The error indicates that the result of the cube root calculation is a complex number, which suggests that the cube root of \\(-\\frac{61}{181}\\) is not a real number. This means there are no real solutions to the equation \\(181q^3 + 61 = 0\\).\n\nGiven this, the correct response is to report that there are no real values that satisfy the equation.\n\n<<<>>>"
