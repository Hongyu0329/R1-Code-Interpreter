    "To solve the quadratic equation \\(86b^2 - 2b - 13 = 0\\), we can use the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[ b = \\frac{-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A} \\]\n\nwhere \\(A = 86\\), \\(B = -2\\), and \\(C = -13\\).\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the discriminant \\(D = B^2 - 4AC\\). If the discriminant is positive, there are two real solutions. If it is zero, there is one real solution. If it is negative, there are no real solutions.\n\nLet's calculate the discriminant and then find the solutions using the quadratic formula.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coefficients\nA = 86\nB = -2\nC = -13\n\n# Calculate the discriminant\nD = B**2 - 4*A*C\n\n# Check the discriminant and calculate the solutions\nif D > 0:\n    # Two real solutions\n    b1 = (-B + math.sqrt(D)) / (2*A)\n    b2 = (-B - math.sqrt(D)) / (2*A)\n    result = f\"{b1:.4f}, {b2:.4f}\"\nelif D == 0:\n    # One real solution\n    b = -B / (2*A)\n    result = f\"{b:.4f}\"\nelse:\n    # No real solutions\n    result = \"\"\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the real values of \\(b\\).",
    "Based on the code execution, the real values of \\( b \\) that satisfy the equation \\( 86b^2 - 2b - 13 = 0 \\) are:\n\n<<<0.4006, -0.3773>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
