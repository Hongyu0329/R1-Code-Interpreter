    "To solve the equation \\(-8k^3 - 47k = 0\\), we can start by factoring out the common term \\(k\\):\n\n\\[ k(-8k^2 - 47) = 0 \\]\n\nThis gives us two separate equations to solve:\n\n1. \\( k = 0 \\)\n2. \\(-8k^2 - 47 = 0\\)\n\nThe first equation \\( k = 0 \\) is straightforward and gives us one solution: \\( k = 0 \\).\n\nFor the second equation \\(-8k^2 - 47 = 0\\), we can solve for \\( k^2 \\):\n\n\\[ -8k^2 = 47 \\]\n\\[ k^2 = -\\frac{47}{8} \\]\n\nSince \\( k^2 \\) is negative, there are no real solutions for this equation. Therefore, the only real solution to the original equation is \\( k = 0 \\).\n\nLet's confirm this by solving the equation using Python to ensure there are no computational errors.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the variable and equation\nk = sp.symbols('k')\nequation = -8*k**3 - 47*k\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolutions = sp.solve(equation, k)\n\n# Convert solutions to decimal and round to 4 decimal places\ndecimal_solutions = [float(sol.evalf()) for sol in solutions]\nrounded_solutions = [round(sol, 4) for sol in decimal_solutions]\n\n# Print the solutions\nprint(rounded_solutions)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will obtain the real solutions, if any, and then provide the final answer.",
    "The error indicates that the solutions include complex numbers, which cannot be directly converted to floats. This confirms that the equation \\(-8k^3 - 47k = 0\\) has complex solutions for the non-zero terms, and the only real solution is \\(k = 0\\).\n\nGiven this, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0.0000>>>"
