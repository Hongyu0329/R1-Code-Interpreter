For example: \"-0.3773, 0.4005\"\n2. For solutions that can be expressed in exact form (like \"u = 2 + sqrt(4560)/172\" and \"u = 2 - sqrt(4560)/172\"), convert them to decimal form in your final answer.\n3. If there are no real values that satisfy the equation, report your answer as an empty string: \"\"\n4. Format your answer based on the number of solutions:\n   - For 1 solution: a single decimal number\n   - For 2 solutions: two comma-separated decimal numbers\n   - For 3 or more solutions: all values as comma-separated decimal numbers\n   - Enclose the answer within triple angle brackets, like <<<number/numbers>>>.\n5.

    "To solve the equation \\(-51s - 76 = 0\\) for the real value of \\(s\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Isolate \\(s\\) by adding 76 to both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   -51s = 76\n   \\]\n\n2. Divide both sides by -51 to solve for \\(s\\):\n   \\[\n   s = \\frac{76}{-51}\n   \\]\n\n3. Calculate the decimal value of \\(s\\) and round it to four decimal places.\n\nLet's compute this using Python to ensure accuracy and proper formatting.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of s\ns = 76 / -51\n\n# Round the result to four decimal places\ns_rounded = round(s, 4)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(s_rounded)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, we will have the solution for \\(s\\) rounded to four decimal places.",
    "The code execution has provided the solution to the equation \\(-51s - 76 = 0\\). The value of \\(s\\) is calculated and rounded to four decimal places.\n\nThe solution is:\n<<<-1.4902>>>"
