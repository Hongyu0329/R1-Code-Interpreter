    "To solve the equation \\(-k^2 + 148k = 0\\), we can start by factoring the equation. The equation can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[\n-k(k - 148) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis equation is satisfied when either \\(k = 0\\) or \\(k - 148 = 0\\). Solving for \\(k\\) in the second equation gives \\(k = 148\\).\n\nThus, the solutions to the equation are \\(k = 0\\) and \\(k = 148\\).\n\nNow, let's ensure these solutions are in the correct format and rounded to four decimal places. Since both solutions are integers, they do not require rounding.\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script to ensure the solutions are correct and formatted properly.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the variable\nk = sp.symbols('k')\n\n# Define the equation\nequation = -k**2 + 148*k\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolutions = sp.solve(equation, k)\n\n# Format the solutions to four decimal places\nformatted_solutions = [f\"{sol.evalf():.4f}\" for sol in solutions]\n\n# Print the formatted solutions\nprint(\", \".join(formatted_solutions))\n```\n\nThis code will solve the equation and format the solutions to four decimal places. Let's execute it to confirm the results.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the solutions to the equation \\(-k^2 + 148k = 0\\) as \\(k = 0.0000\\) and \\(k = 148.0000\\). These are the real values of \\(k\\) that satisfy the equation.\n\nNow, according to the instructions, I need to provide the final answer in the specified format. Since there are two solutions, I will present them as two comma-separated decimal numbers.\n\n<<<0.0000, 148.0000>>>"
