    "To solve the polynomial equation \\(115r^3 - 47r^2 = 0\\), we can start by factoring the equation. \n\nThe equation can be rewritten as:\n\\[ r^2(115r - 47) = 0 \\]\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions:\n1. \\( r^2 = 0 \\)\n2. \\( 115r - 47 = 0 \\)\n\nLet's solve these equations:\n\n1. \\( r^2 = 0 \\) implies \\( r = 0 \\).\n\n2. \\( 115r - 47 = 0 \\) can be solved for \\( r \\) as follows:\n   \\[ 115r = 47 \\]\n   \\[ r = \\frac{47}{115} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the decimal value of \\( \\frac{47}{115} \\) and round it to four decimal places.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the decimal value of 47/115\nr_value = 47 / 115\n# Round the result to four decimal places\nrounded_r_value = round(r_value, 4)\nprint(rounded_r_value)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the decimal value for the second solution. The solutions to the equation are \\( r = 0 \\) and the calculated decimal value. Let's proceed to the final answer.",
    "The solutions to the polynomial equation \\(115r^3 - 47r^2 = 0\\) are \\(r = 0\\) and \\(r = 0.4087\\). \n\nThus, the final answer, with both solutions rounded to four decimal places, is:\n\n<<<0.0000, 0.4087>>>"
