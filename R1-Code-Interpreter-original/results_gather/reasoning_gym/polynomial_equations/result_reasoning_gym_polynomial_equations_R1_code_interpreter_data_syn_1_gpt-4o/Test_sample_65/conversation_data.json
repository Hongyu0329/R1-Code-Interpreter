    "To solve the equation \\(99g^2 - 6 = 0\\), we need to find the values of \\(g\\) that satisfy this equation. This is a quadratic equation in the form of \\(ag^2 + bg + c = 0\\), where \\(a = 99\\), \\(b = 0\\), and \\(c = -6\\).\n\nThe quadratic formula is given by:\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nSubstituting the values of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{-0 \\pm \\sqrt{0^2 - 4 \\times 99 \\times (-6)}}{2 \\times 99} \\]\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{\\pm \\sqrt{0 + 2376}}{198} \\]\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{\\pm \\sqrt{2376}}{198} \\]\n\nNow, we need to calculate the square root of 2376 and then divide by 198 to find the two possible values of \\(g\\).\n\nLet's compute these values using Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the square root of 2376\nsqrt_2376 = math.sqrt(2376)\n\n# Calculate the two possible values of g\ng1 = sqrt_2376 / 198\ng2 = -sqrt_2376 / 198\n\n# Round the results to 4 decimal places\ng1_rounded = round(g1, 4)\ng2_rounded = round(g2, 4)\n\n# Print the results\nprint(g1_rounded, g2_rounded)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will obtain the two real values of \\(g\\) that satisfy the equation.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the two real values of \\( g \\) that satisfy the equation \\( 99g^2 - 6 = 0 \\). These values are \\( 0.2462 \\) and \\( -0.2462 \\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer, rounded to four decimal places, is:\n\n<<<0.2462, -0.2462>>>"
