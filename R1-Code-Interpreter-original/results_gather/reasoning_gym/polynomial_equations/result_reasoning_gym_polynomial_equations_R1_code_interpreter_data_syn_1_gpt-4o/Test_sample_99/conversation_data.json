    "To solve the quadratic equation \\(-3m^2 - 14m - 16 = 0\\), we can use the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nwhere \\( a = -3 \\), \\( b = -14 \\), and \\( c = -16 \\).\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the discriminant \\( \\Delta = b^2 - 4ac \\). If the discriminant is positive, there are two real solutions. If it is zero, there is one real solution. If it is negative, there are no real solutions.\n\nLet's calculate the discriminant and then find the solutions using the quadratic formula.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coefficients\na = -3\nb = -14\nc = -16\n\n# Calculate the discriminant\ndiscriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c\n\n# Check the discriminant and calculate the roots\nif discriminant > 0:\n    root1 = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)\n    root2 = (-b - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)\n    result = f\"{root1:.4f}, {root2:.4f}\"\nelif discriminant == 0:\n    root = -b / (2*a)\n    result = f\"{root:.4f}\"\nelse:\n    result = \"\"\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the solutions.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the solutions to the quadratic equation. The roots are:\n\n- \\( m_1 = -2.6667 \\)\n- \\( m_2 = -2.0000 \\)\n\nThese are the two real solutions to the equation \\(-3m^2 - 14m - 16 = 0\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-2.6667, -2.0000>>>"
