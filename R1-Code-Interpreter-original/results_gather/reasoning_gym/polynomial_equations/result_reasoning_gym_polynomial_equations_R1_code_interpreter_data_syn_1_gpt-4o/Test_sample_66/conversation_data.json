    "To solve the equation \\(-54n^3 - 61n^2 = 0\\), we can start by factoring out the common term. The equation can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[ n^2(-54n - 61) = 0 \\]\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions:\n\n1. \\( n^2 = 0 \\)\n2. \\(-54n - 61 = 0\\)\n\nLet's solve these equations:\n\n1. \\( n^2 = 0 \\) implies \\( n = 0 \\).\n\n2. Solving \\(-54n - 61 = 0\\) for \\( n \\):\n\n   \\[\n   -54n = 61 \\\\\n   n = -\\frac{61}{54}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the decimal value of \\(-\\frac{61}{54}\\) and round it to four decimal places. We will use Python to perform this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the decimal value of -61/54\nn_value = -61 / 54\n# Round the result to four decimal places\nrounded_n_value = round(n_value, 4)\nprint(rounded_n_value)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the decimal value for the second solution. The final answer will include both solutions: \\( n = 0 \\) and the calculated decimal value.",
    "The code execution has provided the decimal value for the second solution, which is \\(-1.1296\\). Now, we have both solutions for the equation:\n\n1. \\( n = 0 \\)\n2. \\( n = -1.1296 \\)\n\nBoth solutions are real numbers, and we need to present them as comma-separated decimal values rounded to four decimal places.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0.0000, -1.1296>>>"
