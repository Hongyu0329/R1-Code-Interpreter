    "To solve the equation \\(97m^3 - 66m^2 + 25m - 34 = 0\\), we need to find the real roots of this cubic polynomial. The roots of a cubic equation can be found using numerical methods such as the Newton-Raphson method or by using libraries that can handle polynomial equations.\n\nLet's use Python to find the roots of this equation. We will use the `numpy` library, which provides a convenient function `numpy.roots` to find the roots of a polynomial. This function will return all roots, including complex ones, but we will only consider the real roots for our final answer.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Coefficients of the polynomial 97*m^3 - 66*m^2 + 25*m - 34\ncoefficients = [97, -66, 25, -34]\n\n# Find the roots of the polynomial\nroots = np.roots(coefficients)\n\n# Filter out the real roots and round them to 4 decimal places\nreal_roots = [root.real for root in roots if np.isclose(root.imag, 0)]\nreal_roots_rounded = [round(root, 4) for root in real_roots]\n\n# Print the real roots as a comma-separated string\nprint(\",\".join(map(str, real_roots_rounded)))\n```\n\nThis code will compute the roots of the polynomial and filter out the real roots, rounding them to four decimal places. Let's execute this code to find the solution.",
    "The code execution has provided us with a single real root for the cubic equation \\(97m^3 - 66m^2 + 25m - 34 = 0\\). The root is approximately 0.857, rounded to four decimal places.\n\nBased on the instructions, since there is only one real solution, we should present it as a single decimal number.\n\n<<<0.857>>>"
