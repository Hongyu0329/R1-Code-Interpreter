    "To solve the equation \\(71p^3 - 2p - 29 = 0\\), we need to find the real roots of this cubic equation. The process involves:\n\n1. Checking if there are any obvious rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem.\n2. If no rational roots are found, we can use numerical methods to approximate the real roots.\n\nLet's start by attempting to find any rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem, which suggests that any rational root, expressed as a fraction \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), has \\(p\\) as a factor of the constant term (-29) and \\(q\\) as a factor of the leading coefficient (71).\n\nFactors of -29: \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 29\\)\n\nFactors of 71: \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 71\\)\n\nPossible rational roots: \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 29, \\pm \\frac{1}{71}, \\pm \\frac{29}{71}\\)\n\nWe will test these possible roots in the equation to see if any of them satisfy it. If none of these are roots, we will proceed with a numerical method to find the real roots.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to check for rational roots and, if necessary, find the real roots numerically.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, N\n\n# Define the variable and the equation\np = symbols('p')\nequation = Eq(71*p**3 - 2*p - 29, 0)\n\n# Attempt to find rational roots\npossible_rational_roots = [1, -1, 29, -29, 1/71, -1/71, 29/71, -29/71]\nrational_roots = [root for root in possible_rational_roots if equation.subs(p, root) == 0]\n\n# If no rational roots are found, find numerical solutions\nif not rational_roots:\n    numerical_roots = solve(equation, p)\n    real_roots = [N(root, 4) for root in numerical_roots if root.is_real]\nelse:\n    real_roots = rational_roots\n\n# Print the real roots rounded to 4 decimal places\nprint(\", \".join(f\"{root:.4f}\" for root in real_roots))\n```\n\nThis code will first check for rational roots and then find numerical solutions if necessary. Let's execute it to find the real roots of the equation.",
    "The code execution has provided us with a single real root for the equation \\(71p^3 - 2p - 29 = 0\\). The root is approximately 0.7546 when rounded to four decimal places.\n\nTherefore, the real value of \\(p\\) that satisfies the equation is:\n\n<<<0.7546>>>"
