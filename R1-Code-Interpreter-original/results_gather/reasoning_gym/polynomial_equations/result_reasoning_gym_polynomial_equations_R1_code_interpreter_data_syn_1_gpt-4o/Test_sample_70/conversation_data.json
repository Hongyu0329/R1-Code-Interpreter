    "To solve the equation \\(-50e^3 + 55e^2 + 76e = 0\\), we can start by factoring out the common term \\(e\\):\n\n\\[ e(-50e^2 + 55e + 76) = 0 \\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(e = 0\\).\n\nNext, we need to solve the quadratic equation:\n\n\\[ -50e^2 + 55e + 76 = 0 \\]\n\nWe can use the quadratic formula to find the roots of this equation:\n\n\\[ e = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -50\\), \\(b = 55\\), and \\(c = 76\\).\n\nLet's calculate the discriminant and the roots using Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coefficients\na = -50\nb = 55\nc = 76\n\n# Discriminant\ndiscriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c\n\n# Roots calculation\nif discriminant >= 0:\n    root1 = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)\n    root2 = (-b - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)\n    roots = [0, root1, root2]\nelse:\n    roots = [0]\n\n# Round the roots to 4 decimal places\nrounded_roots = [round(root, 4) for root in roots]\n\n# Print the roots\nprint(rounded_roots)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the roots.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the roots of the equation. The roots are \\(e = 0\\), \\(e = -0.8\\), and \\(e = 1.9\\). These are the real solutions to the equation \\(-50e^3 + 55e^2 + 76e = 0\\).\n\nNow, let's format the final answer according to the instructions:\n\n<<<0, -0.8, 1.9>>>"
