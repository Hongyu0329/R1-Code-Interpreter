    "To solve the equation \\(44 - 95y^2 = 0\\), we need to find the real values of \\(y\\).\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n1. **Rearrange the Equation:**\n   \\[\n   44 = 95y^2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Solve for \\(y^2\\):**\n   \\[\n   y^2 = \\frac{44}{95}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Take the Square Root:**\n   \\[\n   y = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{44}{95}}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Decimal Values:**\n   We need to compute the square root of \\(\\frac{44}{95}\\) and then find both the positive and negative roots.\n\nLet's calculate these values using Python to ensure accuracy and proper rounding.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the square root of 44/95\nvalue = math.sqrt(44 / 95)\n\n# Prepare the results for both positive and negative roots\npositive_y = value\nnegative_y = -value\n\n# Round the results to 4 decimal places\npositive_y_rounded = round(positive_y, 4)\nnegative_y_rounded = round(negative_y, 4)\n\n# Print the results\nprint(negative_y_rounded, positive_y_rounded)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will obtain the real values of \\(y\\) rounded to four decimal places.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the two real values of \\(y\\) that satisfy the equation \\(44 - 95y^2 = 0\\). These values are:\n\n- \\(y = -0.6806\\)\n- \\(y = 0.6806\\)\n\nBoth values are rounded to four decimal places as required.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-0.6806, 0.6806>>>"
