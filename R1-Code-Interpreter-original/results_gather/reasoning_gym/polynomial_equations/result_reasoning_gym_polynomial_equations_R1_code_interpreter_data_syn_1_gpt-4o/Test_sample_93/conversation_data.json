    "To solve the polynomial equation \\(79h + 10 = 0\\) for real \\(h\\), we need to isolate \\(h\\). The equation is linear, so it has a straightforward solution.\n\n### Steps to solve the equation:\n\n1. **Isolate \\(h\\):**  \n   Start by subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   79h = -10\n   \\]\n\n2. **Solve for \\(h\\):**  \n   Divide both sides by 79 to solve for \\(h\\):\n   \\[\n   h = \\frac{-10}{79}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Convert to decimal form:**  \n   Calculate the decimal value of \\(\\frac{-10}{79}\\) and round it to four decimal places.\n\nLet's compute the decimal value using Python:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of h\nh = -10 / 79\n# Round the result to four decimal places\nrounded_h = round(h, 4)\nprint(rounded_h)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will obtain the decimal value of \\(h\\) rounded to four decimal places. This will give us the final answer.",
    "The solution to the equation \\(79h + 10 = 0\\) is \\(h = -0.1266\\) when rounded to four decimal places.\n\n<<<-0.1266>>>"
