    "To solve the polynomial equation \\(27t^2 = 0\\), we need to find the values of \\(t\\) that satisfy this equation.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1. **Equation Simplification**: The given equation is \\(27t^2 = 0\\). We can simplify this by dividing both sides by 27, which gives us:\n   \\[\n   t^2 = 0\n   \\]\n\n2. **Solving for \\(t\\)**: The equation \\(t^2 = 0\\) implies that \\(t\\) must be a value that, when squared, equals zero. The only real number that satisfies this condition is \\(t = 0\\).\n\n3. **Number of Solutions**: Since \\(t = 0\\) is the only solution, we have a single solution.\n\n4. **Formatting the Solution**: According to the instructions, for a single solution, we should provide the answer as a single decimal number. Therefore, the solution is \\(0.0000\\).\n\nNow, let's proceed to provide the final answer.\n\n<<<0.0000>>>"
