    "To solve the equation \\(-148a^3 + 56a^2 - 9 = 0\\), we need to find the real roots of this cubic equation. The process involves using numerical methods to approximate the roots since analytical solutions for cubic equations can be complex and cumbersome.\n\nLet's proceed with the following steps:\n\n1. **Identify the equation**: The given equation is \\(-148a^3 + 56a^2 - 9 = 0\\).\n\n2. **Use numerical methods**: We can use a numerical solver to find the roots of this cubic equation. Python's `numpy` library provides a convenient method to find the roots of a polynomial.\n\n3. **Round the results**: Once we have the roots, we will round them to four decimal places as per the instructions.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the real roots of the equation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Coefficients of the polynomial -148a^3 + 56a^2 - 9 = 0\ncoefficients = [-148, 56, 0, -9]\n\n# Find the roots of the polynomial\nroots = np.roots(coefficients)\n\n# Filter real roots and round them to 4 decimal places\nreal_roots = [round(root.real, 4) for root in roots if np.isreal(root)]\n\n# Print the real roots as comma-separated values\nprint(\",\".join(map(str, real_roots)))\n```\n\nThis code will compute the real roots of the given cubic equation and output them in the required format.",
    "The code execution has provided us with one real root for the cubic equation \\(-148a^3 + 56a^2 - 9 = 0\\). The root is \\(-0.2995\\).\n\nBased on the instructions, since there is only one real solution, we will format the answer as a single decimal number.\n\n<<<-0.2995>>>"
