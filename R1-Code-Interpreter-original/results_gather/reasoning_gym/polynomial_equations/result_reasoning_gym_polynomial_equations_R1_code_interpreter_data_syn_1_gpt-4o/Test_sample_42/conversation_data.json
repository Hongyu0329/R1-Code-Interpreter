    "To solve the equation \\(16v^3 + 24v^2 = 0\\), we can start by factoring out the common term. The equation can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[ v^2(16v + 24) = 0 \\]\n\nThis gives us two separate equations to solve:\n\n1. \\( v^2 = 0 \\)\n2. \\( 16v + 24 = 0 \\)\n\nLet's solve these equations:\n\n1. \\( v^2 = 0 \\) implies \\( v = 0 \\).\n\n2. Solving \\( 16v + 24 = 0 \\) for \\( v \\):\n\n\\[ 16v = -24 \\]\n\\[ v = -\\frac{24}{16} \\]\n\\[ v = -\\frac{3}{2} \\]\n\nNow, we have two solutions: \\( v = 0 \\) and \\( v = -1.5 \\).\n\nLet's ensure these solutions are correct by evaluating them in the original equation. We can use Python to verify and format the solutions.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the variable\nv = sp.symbols('v')\n\n# Define the equation\nequation = 16*v**3 + 24*v**2\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolutions = sp.solve(equation, v)\n\n# Convert solutions to decimal and round to 4 decimal places\ndecimal_solutions = [float(sol.evalf()) for sol in solutions]\nrounded_solutions = [round(sol, 4) for sol in decimal_solutions]\n\n# Print the solutions\nprint(rounded_solutions)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will obtain the solutions in decimal form, rounded to four decimal places.",
    "The code execution confirms that the solutions to the equation \\(16v^3 + 24v^2 = 0\\) are \\(v = -1.5\\) and \\(v = 0.0\\). These solutions are already in decimal form and rounded to four decimal places.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-1.5, 0.0>>>"
