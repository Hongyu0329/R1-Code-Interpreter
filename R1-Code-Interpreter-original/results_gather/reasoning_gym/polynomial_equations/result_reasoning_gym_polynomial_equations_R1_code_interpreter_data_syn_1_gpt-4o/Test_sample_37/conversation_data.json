    "To solve the polynomial equation \\(9x + 42 = 0\\), we need to isolate \\(x\\). Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Start with the equation: \n   \\[\n   9x + 42 = 0\n   \\]\n\n2. Subtract 42 from both sides to isolate the term with \\(x\\):\n   \\[\n   9x = -42\n   \\]\n\n3. Divide both sides by 9 to solve for \\(x\\):\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{-42}{9}\n   \\]\n\n4. Simplify the fraction:\n   \\[\n   x = -\\frac{42}{9} = -\\frac{14}{3}\n   \\]\n\n5. Convert the fraction to a decimal:\n   \\[\n   x = -4.6666\\ldots\n   \\]\n\n6. Round the decimal to four decimal places:\n   \\[\n   x = -4.6666\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using Python to ensure accuracy and proper rounding.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the solution for the equation 9*x + 42 = 0\nx = -42 / 9\n# Round the result to four decimal places\nrounded_x = round(x, 4)\nprint(rounded_x)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the final answer.",
    "The code execution confirms the calculation and rounding process. The solution to the equation \\(9x + 42 = 0\\) is a single real number. \n\nThe final answer, rounded to four decimal places, is:\n\n<<<-4.6667>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Solve the polynomial equation for real x:\n9*x + 42 = 0\nIn solving equations, please follow these instructions:\n1.
