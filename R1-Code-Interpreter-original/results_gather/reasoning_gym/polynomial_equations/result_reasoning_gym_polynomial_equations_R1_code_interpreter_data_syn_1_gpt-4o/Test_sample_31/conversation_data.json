    "To solve the equation \\(-85q^2 - 181q = 0\\), we can factor out the common term \\(q\\):\n\n\\[\nq(-85q - 181) = 0\n\\]\n\nThis gives us two possible solutions:\n\n1. \\(q = 0\\)\n2. \\(-85q - 181 = 0\\)\n\nFor the second equation, we solve for \\(q\\):\n\n\\[\n-85q = 181 \\\\\nq = -\\frac{181}{85}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the decimal value of \\(-\\frac{181}{85}\\) and round it to four decimal places. We will use Python to perform this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the decimal value of -181/85\nq_value = -181 / 85\n# Round the result to four decimal places\nrounded_q_value = round(q_value, 4)\nprint(rounded_q_value)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the decimal value for the second solution. The final answer will include both solutions, \\(q = 0\\) and the calculated decimal value.",
    "The solutions to the equation \\(-85q^2 - 181q = 0\\) are:\n\n1. \\(q = 0\\)\n2. \\(q = -2.1294\\)\n\nBoth solutions are real numbers. Therefore, the final answer, rounded to four decimal places, is:\n\n<<<0.0000, -2.1294>>>"
