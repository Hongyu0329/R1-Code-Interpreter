For example: \"-0.3773, 0.4005\"\n2. For solutions that can be expressed in exact form (like \"u = 2 + sqrt(4560)/172\" and \"u = 2 - sqrt(4560)/172\"), convert them to decimal form in your final answer.\n3. If there are no real values that satisfy the equation, report your answer as an empty string: \"\"\n4. Format your answer based on the number of solutions:\n   - For 1 solution: a single decimal number\n   - For 2 solutions: two comma-separated decimal numbers\n   - For 3 or more solutions: all values as comma-separated decimal numbers\n   - Enclose the answer within triple angle brackets, like <<<number/numbers>>>.\n5. Round all decimal values to 4 decimal places (rounding down when the 5th decimal place is 5 or greater).\n",

    "To solve the equation \\(87l - 3 = 0\\), we need to isolate the variable \\(l\\). \n\n1. Start by adding 3 to both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   87l = 3\n   \\]\n\n2. Next, divide both sides by 87 to solve for \\(l\\):\n   \\[\n   l = \\frac{3}{87}\n   \\]\n\n3. Simplify the fraction:\n   \\[\n   l = \\frac{1}{29}\n   \\]\n\n4. Convert the fraction to a decimal and round to four decimal places.\n\nLet's calculate this using Python to ensure accuracy and proper formatting.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of l\nl = 1 / 29\n# Round to four decimal places\nl_rounded = round(l, 4)\nprint(l_rounded)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will obtain the rounded decimal value of \\(l\\).",
    "The calculation and rounding have been performed correctly. The real value of \\( l \\) in the equation \\( 87l - 3 = 0 \\) is 0.0345 when rounded to four decimal places.\n\n<<<0.0345>>>"
