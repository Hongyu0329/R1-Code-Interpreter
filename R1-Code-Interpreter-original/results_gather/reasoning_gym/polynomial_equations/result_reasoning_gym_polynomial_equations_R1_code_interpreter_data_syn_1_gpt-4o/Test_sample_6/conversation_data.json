    "To solve the equation \\(78 - 69w^2 = 0\\), we need to find the real values of \\(w\\) that satisfy this equation. Let's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Rearrange the equation**: \n   \\[\n   78 - 69w^2 = 0 \\implies 69w^2 = 78\n   \\]\n\n2. **Solve for \\(w^2\\)**:\n   \\[\n   w^2 = \\frac{78}{69}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the fraction**:\n   \\[\n   w^2 = \\frac{78}{69} = \\frac{26}{23}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Take the square root of both sides** to solve for \\(w\\):\n   \\[\n   w = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{26}{23}}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Convert the solutions to decimal form** and round to four decimal places.\n\nLet's calculate the decimal values using Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the square root of 26/23\nw1 = math.sqrt(26/23)\nw2 = -math.sqrt(26/23)\n\n# Round the results to four decimal places\nw1_rounded = round(w1, 4)\nw2_rounded = round(w2, 4)\n\n# Print the results\nprint(w1_rounded, w2_rounded)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the decimal values for \\(w\\). Let's proceed with the calculation.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the decimal values for \\(w\\). Based on the output, the real values of \\(w\\) that satisfy the equation \\(78 - 69w^2 = 0\\) are:\n\n<<<1.0632, -1.0632>>>"
