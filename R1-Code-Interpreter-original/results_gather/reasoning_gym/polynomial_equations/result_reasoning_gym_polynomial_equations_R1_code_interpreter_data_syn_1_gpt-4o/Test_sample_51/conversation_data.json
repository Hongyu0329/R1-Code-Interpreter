    "To solve the equation \\(39 - 53f^2 = 0\\), we need to find the real values of \\(f\\).\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n1. **Rearrange the Equation:**\n   \\[\n   39 - 53f^2 = 0 \\implies 53f^2 = 39\n   \\]\n\n2. **Solve for \\(f^2\\):**\n   \\[\n   f^2 = \\frac{39}{53}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Take the Square Root:**\n   \\[\n   f = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{39}{53}}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Decimal Values:**\n   We need to compute the square root and then round the results to four decimal places.\n\nLet's calculate these values using Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the square root of 39/53\nf1 = math.sqrt(39/53)\nf2 = -math.sqrt(39/53)\n\n# Round the results to four decimal places\nf1_rounded = round(f1, 4)\nf2_rounded = round(f2, 4)\n\nprint(f\"{f1_rounded}, {f2_rounded}\")\n```\n\nThis code will compute the two possible values for \\(f\\) and round them to four decimal places. Let's execute it to find the final answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the two real solutions for the equation \\(39 - 53f^2 = 0\\). The solutions are rounded to four decimal places as required.\n\nThe solutions are:\n- \\(f = 0.8578\\)\n- \\(f = -0.8578\\)\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0.8578, -0.8578>>>"
