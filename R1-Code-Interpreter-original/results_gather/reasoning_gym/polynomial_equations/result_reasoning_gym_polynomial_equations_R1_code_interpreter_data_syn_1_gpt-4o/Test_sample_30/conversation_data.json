For example: \"-0.3773, 0.4005\"\n2. For solutions that can be expressed in exact form (like \"u = 2 + sqrt(4560)/172\" and \"u = 2 - sqrt(4560)/172\"), convert them to decimal form in your final answer.\n3. If there are no real values that satisfy the equation, report your answer as an empty string: \"\"\n4. Format your answer based on the number of solutions:\n   - For 1 solution: a single decimal number\n   - For 2 solutions: two comma-separated decimal numbers\n   - For 3 or more solutions: all values as comma-separated decimal numbers\n   - Enclose the answer within triple angle brackets, like <<<number/numbers>>>.\n5. Round all decimal values to 4 decimal places (rounding down when the 5th decimal place is 5 or greater).\n",

    "To solve the equation \\(-60u - 86 = 0\\) for the real value of \\(u\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Isolate the variable \\(u\\) by adding 86 to both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   -60u = 86\n   \\]\n\n2. Divide both sides by -60 to solve for \\(u\\):\n   \\[\n   u = \\frac{86}{-60}\n   \\]\n\n3. Simplify the fraction and convert it to a decimal.\n\nLet's calculate the decimal value using Python to ensure accuracy and proper rounding.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of u\nu = 86 / -60\n\n# Round the result to 4 decimal places\nu_rounded = round(u, 4)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(u_rounded)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will obtain the value of \\(u\\) rounded to four decimal places.",
    "The calculation has been completed successfully. The solution to the equation \\(-60u - 86 = 0\\) is a single real number. \n\nBased on the code output, the value of \\(u\\) is:\n\n<<<-1.4333>>>"
