    "To solve the quadratic equation \\(97c^2 + 98c + 7 = 0\\), we can use the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[ c = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nwhere \\(a = 97\\), \\(b = 98\\), and \\(c = 7\\).\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[ \\text{discriminant} = b^2 - 4ac \\]\n\nIf the discriminant is positive, there are two real solutions. If it is zero, there is one real solution. If it is negative, there are no real solutions.\n\nLet's calculate the discriminant and then find the solutions using the quadratic formula.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coefficients\na = 97\nb = 98\nc = 7\n\n# Calculate the discriminant\ndiscriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c\n\n# Check the discriminant and calculate the solutions\nif discriminant > 0:\n    # Two real solutions\n    root1 = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)\n    root2 = (-b - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)\n    result = f\"{root1:.4f}, {root2:.4f}\"\nelif discriminant == 0:\n    # One real solution\n    root = -b / (2*a)\n    result = f\"{root:.4f}\"\nelse:\n    # No real solutions\n    result = \"\"\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the solutions.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the solutions to the quadratic equation \\(97c^2 + 98c + 7 = 0\\). The discriminant was positive, indicating two real solutions. The solutions are:\n\n<<<-0.0774, -0.9330>>>"
