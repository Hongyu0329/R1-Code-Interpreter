    "To solve the equation \\(-6u - 52 = 0\\), we need to isolate the variable \\(u\\). Let's go through the steps:\n\n1. Start with the equation: \\(-6u - 52 = 0\\).\n2. Add 52 to both sides to get: \\(-6u = 52\\).\n3. Divide both sides by \\(-6\\) to solve for \\(u\\): \n\n\\[\nu = \\frac{52}{-6}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of \\(u\\) using Python to ensure accuracy and proper formatting.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of u\nu = 52 / -6\n# Print the result rounded to 4 decimal places\nprint(round(u, 4))\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the value of \\(u\\) rounded to four decimal places.",
    "The calculation has been completed successfully. The real value of \\( u \\) that satisfies the equation \\(-6u - 52 = 0\\) is \\(-8.6667\\).\n\n<<<-8.6667>>>"
