    "To solve the equation \\(76 \\cdot y^2 = 0\\), we need to find the real values of \\(y\\) that satisfy this equation.\n\n### Reasoning Process:\n\n1. **Understanding the Equation**: \n   - The equation is \\(76 \\cdot y^2 = 0\\).\n   - For a product to be zero, at least one of the factors must be zero.\n   - Here, \\(76\\) is a constant and non-zero, so the only way for the product to be zero is if \\(y^2 = 0\\).\n\n2. **Solving for \\(y\\)**:\n   - If \\(y^2 = 0\\), then \\(y\\) must be 0 because the square of zero is zero.\n\n3. **Checking for Real Solutions**:\n   - The solution \\(y = 0\\) is a real number.\n\n4. **Formatting the Answer**:\n   - Since there is only one solution, we will provide it as a single decimal number.\n   - The solution is \\(y = 0\\), which is already in decimal form.\n\nNow, let's confirm this by executing a simple Python script to solve the equation and ensure the solution is correct.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\ny = symbols('y')\n\n# Define the equation\nequation = Eq(76 * y**2, 0)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolutions = solve(equation, y)\n\n# Print the solutions\nprint(solutions)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will interpret the result and provide the final answer.",
    "The code output indicates that the solution to the equation \\(76 \\cdot y^2 = 0\\) is \\(y = 0\\).\n\nSince there is only one solution, we format the answer as a single decimal number.\n\n<<<0.0000>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
