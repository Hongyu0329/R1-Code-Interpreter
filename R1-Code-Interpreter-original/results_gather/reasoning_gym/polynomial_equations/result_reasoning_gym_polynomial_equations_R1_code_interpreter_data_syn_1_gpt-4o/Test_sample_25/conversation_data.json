    "To solve the equation \\(7 - 128b^2 = 0\\) for real \\(b\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Rearrange the equation to isolate the term with \\(b\\):\n   \\[\n   128b^2 = 7\n   \\]\n\n2. Divide both sides by 128 to solve for \\(b^2\\):\n   \\[\n   b^2 = \\frac{7}{128}\n   \\]\n\n3. Take the square root of both sides to solve for \\(b\\):\n   \\[\n   b = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{7}{128}}\n   \\]\n\n4. Calculate the decimal values for the solutions.\n\nLet's compute the decimal values using Python code:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the solutions\nb1 = math.sqrt(7 / 128)\nb2 = -math.sqrt(7 / 128)\n\n# Print the solutions rounded to 4 decimal places\nprint(round(b1, 4), round(b2, 4))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the solutions.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the solutions to the equation \\(7 - 128b^2 = 0\\). The solutions are \\(b = 0.2339\\) and \\(b = -0.2339\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer, rounded to four decimal places, is:\n\n<<<0.2339, -0.2339>>>"
