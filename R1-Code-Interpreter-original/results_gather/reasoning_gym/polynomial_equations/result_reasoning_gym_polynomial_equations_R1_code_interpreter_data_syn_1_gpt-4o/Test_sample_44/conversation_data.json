    "To solve the quadratic equation \\(-7n^2 + 97n - 31 = 0\\), we can use the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nwhere \\( a = -7 \\), \\( b = 97 \\), and \\( c = -31 \\).\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the discriminant \\( \\Delta = b^2 - 4ac \\). If the discriminant is positive, there are two real solutions. If it is zero, there is one real solution. If it is negative, there are no real solutions.\n\nLet's calculate the discriminant and then use the quadratic formula to find the solutions.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coefficients\na = -7\nb = 97\nc = -31\n\n# Calculate the discriminant\ndiscriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c\n\n# Calculate the two solutions using the quadratic formula\nif discriminant >= 0:\n    sqrt_discriminant = math.sqrt(discriminant)\n    n1 = (-b + sqrt_discriminant) / (2*a)\n    n2 = (-b - sqrt_discriminant) / (2*a)\n    # Round the solutions to 4 decimal places\n    n1 = round(n1, 4)\n    n2 = round(n2, 4)\n    # Print the solutions\n    print(f\"{n1}, {n2}\")\nelse:\n    # No real solutions\n    print(\"\")\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the solutions.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the solutions to the quadratic equation \\(-7n^2 + 97n - 31 = 0\\). The solutions are two real numbers, which are:\n\n- \\( n_1 = 0.3273 \\)\n- \\( n_2 = 13.5298 \\)\n\nThese values are rounded to four decimal places as required.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0.3273, 13.5298>>>"
