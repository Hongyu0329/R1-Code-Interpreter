    "To solve the quadratic equation \\(44n^2 + 90n - 63 = 0\\), we can use the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nwhere \\(a = 44\\), \\(b = 90\\), and \\(c = -63\\).\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the discriminant, \\(b^2 - 4ac\\), to determine the nature of the roots.\n\nLet's compute the discriminant and then use it to find the roots of the equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coefficients\na = 44\nb = 90\nc = -63\n\n# Calculate the discriminant\ndiscriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c\n\n# Check if the discriminant is non-negative\nif discriminant >= 0:\n    # Calculate the two roots using the quadratic formula\n    root1 = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)\n    root2 = (-b - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)\n    # Round the roots to 4 decimal places\n    root1 = round(root1, 4)\n    root2 = round(root2, 4)\n    print(f\"{root1}, {root2}\")\nelse:\n    # If the discriminant is negative, there are no real roots\n    print(\"\")\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the real values of \\(n\\).",
    "The code execution has provided us with the two real roots of the quadratic equation \\(44n^2 + 90n - 63 = 0\\). These roots are the solutions to the equation.\n\nThe roots are:\n- \\(n_1 = 0.5514\\)\n- \\(n_2 = -2.5968\\)\n\nBoth values are rounded to four decimal places as required.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0.5514, -2.5968>>>"
