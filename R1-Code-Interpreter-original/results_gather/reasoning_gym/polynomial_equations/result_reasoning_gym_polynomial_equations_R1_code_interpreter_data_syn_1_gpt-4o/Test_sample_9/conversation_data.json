    "To solve the equation \\(50o^2 - 89 = 0\\), we need to find the values of \\(o\\) that satisfy this equation. This is a quadratic equation of the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), where \\(a = 50\\), \\(b = 0\\), and \\(c = -89\\).\n\nThe solutions to a quadratic equation can be found using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\no = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[\no = \\frac{-0 \\pm \\sqrt{0^2 - 4 \\times 50 \\times (-89)}}{2 \\times 50}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying further:\n\n\\[\no = \\frac{\\pm \\sqrt{4 \\times 50 \\times 89}}{100}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the values of \\(o\\) using Python to ensure accuracy and rounding to four decimal places.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coefficients\na = 50\nb = 0\nc = -89\n\n# Calculate the discriminant\ndiscriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c\n\n# Calculate the two solutions\no1 = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)\no2 = (-b - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)\n\n# Round the solutions to 4 decimal places\no1 = round(o1, 4)\no2 = round(o2, 4)\n\nprint(o1, o2)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the two solutions for \\(o\\).",
    "The code has successfully calculated the two real solutions for the equation \\(50o^2 - 89 = 0\\). The solutions are \\(o = 1.3342\\) and \\(o = -1.3342\\).\n\nTherefore, the real values of \\(o\\) that satisfy the equation are:\n\n<<<1.3342, -1.3342>>>"
