    "To solve the polynomial equation \\(-30u - 28 = 0\\), we need to isolate the variable \\(u\\). This is a linear equation, so it will have exactly one solution. Let's solve it step by step:\n\n1. Start with the equation: \\(-30u - 28 = 0\\).\n2. Add 28 to both sides to isolate the term with \\(u\\): \\(-30u = 28\\).\n3. Divide both sides by \\(-30\\) to solve for \\(u\\): \\(u = \\frac{28}{-30}\\).\n\nNow, let's calculate the decimal value of \\(u\\) and round it to four decimal places.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of u\nu = 28 / -30\n# Round the result to four decimal places\nrounded_u = round(u, 4)\nprint(rounded_u)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, we will have the solution for \\(u\\) rounded to four decimal places.",
    "The solution to the equation \\(-30u - 28 = 0\\) is \\(u = -0.9333\\) when rounded to four decimal places.\n\n<<<-0.9333>>>"
