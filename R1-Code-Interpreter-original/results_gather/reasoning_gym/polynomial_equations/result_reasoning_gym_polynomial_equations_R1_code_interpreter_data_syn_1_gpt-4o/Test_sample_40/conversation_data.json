    "To solve the equation \\(40c^3 + 107c^2 + 88c = 0\\), we can start by factoring out the common term \\(c\\):\n\n\\[ c(40c^2 + 107c + 88) = 0 \\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(c = 0\\).\n\nNext, we need to solve the quadratic equation \\(40c^2 + 107c + 88 = 0\\). We can use the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[ c = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nwhere \\(a = 40\\), \\(b = 107\\), and \\(c = 88\\).\n\nLet's calculate the discriminant and the roots using Python to ensure accuracy and rounding to four decimal places.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coefficients\na = 40\nb = 107\nc = 88\n\n# Discriminant\ndiscriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c\n\n# Check if the discriminant is non-negative\nif discriminant >= 0:\n    # Calculate the two roots\n    root1 = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)\n    root2 = (-b - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)\n    # Round the roots to 4 decimal places\n    root1 = round(root1, 4)\n    root2 = round(root2, 4)\n    # Print the roots\n    print(f\"0, {root1}, {root2}\")\nelse:\n    # If the discriminant is negative, there are no real roots\n    print(\"0\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the roots.",
    "The code output indicates that the discriminant is negative, which means the quadratic equation \\(40c^2 + 107c + 88 = 0\\) has no real roots. Therefore, the only real solution to the original equation \\(40c^3 + 107c^2 + 88c = 0\\) is \\(c = 0\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
