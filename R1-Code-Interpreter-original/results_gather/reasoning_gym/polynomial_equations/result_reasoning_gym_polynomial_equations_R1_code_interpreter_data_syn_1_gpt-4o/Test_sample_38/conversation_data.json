    "To solve the polynomial equation \\(100 - 112o = 0\\), we need to isolate the variable \\(o\\).\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n1. **Rearrange the Equation:**\n   \\[\n   100 - 112o = 0\n   \\]\n   Subtract 100 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   -112o = -100\n   \\]\n\n2. **Solve for \\(o\\):**\n   Divide both sides by -112 to isolate \\(o\\):\n   \\[\n   o = \\frac{-100}{-112}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the Expression:**\n   \\[\n   o = \\frac{100}{112}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Convert to Decimal:**\n   We need to calculate the decimal value of \\(\\frac{100}{112}\\) and round it to four decimal places.\n\nLet's compute this using Python:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of o\no = 100 / 112\n# Round to four decimal places\nrounded_o = round(o, 4)\nprint(rounded_o)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the decimal value of \\(o\\) rounded to four decimal places.",
    "The solution to the equation \\(100 - 112o = 0\\) is \\(o = 0.8929\\) when rounded to four decimal places.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0.8929>>>"
