For solutions that can be expressed in exact form (like \"u = 2 + sqrt(4560)/172\" and \"u = 2 - sqrt(4560)/172\"), convert them to decimal form in your final answer.\n3. If there are no real values that satisfy the equation, report your answer as an empty string: \"\"\n4. Format your answer based on the number of solutions:\n   - For 1 solution: a single decimal number\n   - For 2 solutions: two comma-separated decimal numbers\n   - For 3 or more solutions: all values as comma-separated decimal numbers\n   - Enclose the answer within triple angle brackets, like <<<number/numbers>>>.\n5. Round all decimal values to 4 decimal places (rounding down when the 5th decimal place is 5 or greater).\n",

    "To solve the equation \\(57s + 109 = 0\\), we need to isolate the variable \\(s\\). Here is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with the equation:  \n   \\(57s + 109 = 0\\)\n\n2. Subtract 109 from both sides to isolate the term with \\(s\\):  \n   \\(57s = -109\\)\n\n3. Divide both sides by 57 to solve for \\(s\\):  \n   \\(s = \\frac{-109}{57}\\)\n\nNow, let's calculate the decimal value of \\(s\\) and round it to four decimal places.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of s\ns = -109 / 57\n# Print the result rounded to four decimal places\nprint(round(s, 4))\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the decimal value of \\(s\\) rounded to four decimal places. Let's see the result.",
    "The calculation has been completed successfully. The real value of \\( s \\) that satisfies the equation \\( 57s + 109 = 0 \\) is \\(-1.9123\\).\n\n<<<-1.9123>>>"
