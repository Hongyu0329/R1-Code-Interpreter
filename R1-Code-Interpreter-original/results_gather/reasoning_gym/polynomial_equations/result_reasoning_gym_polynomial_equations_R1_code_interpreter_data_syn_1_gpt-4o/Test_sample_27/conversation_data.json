For example: \"-0.3773, 0.4005\"\n2. For solutions that can be expressed in exact form (like \"u = 2 + sqrt(4560)/172\" and \"u = 2 - sqrt(4560)/172\"), convert them to decimal form in your final answer.\n3. If there are no real values that satisfy the equation, report your answer as an empty string: \"\"\n4.

    "To solve the equation \\(127h - 132 = 0\\) for the real value of \\(h\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Isolate \\(h\\) by adding 132 to both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   127h = 132\n   \\]\n\n2. Divide both sides by 127 to solve for \\(h\\):\n   \\[\n   h = \\frac{132}{127}\n   \\]\n\n3. Calculate the decimal value of \\(\\frac{132}{127}\\) and round it to four decimal places.\n\nLet's compute this using Python to ensure accuracy and proper formatting.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of h\nh = 132 / 127\n\n# Round the result to four decimal places\nh_rounded = round(h, 4)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(h_rounded)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the rounded value of \\(h\\).",
    "The calculation has been completed successfully. The solution to the equation \\(127h - 132 = 0\\) is a single real number. \n\nBased on the code output, the value of \\(h\\) rounded to four decimal places is:\n\n<<<1.0394>>>"
