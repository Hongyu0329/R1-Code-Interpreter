    "To solve the equation \\(-21 \\cdot s^2 = 0\\), we need to find the real value(s) of \\(s\\) that satisfy this equation.\n\n### Reasoning Process:\n\n1. **Equation Analysis**: \n   - The equation is \\(-21 \\cdot s^2 = 0\\).\n   - This is a quadratic equation in the form of \\(a \\cdot s^2 = 0\\), where \\(a = -21\\).\n\n2. **Solving the Equation**:\n   - Since the equation is \\(-21 \\cdot s^2 = 0\\), we can divide both sides by \\(-21\\) (since \\(-21\\) is not zero) to simplify the equation to:\n     \\[\n     s^2 = 0\n     \\]\n   - The solution to \\(s^2 = 0\\) is \\(s = 0\\).\n\n3. **Number of Solutions**:\n   - The equation \\(s^2 = 0\\) has only one solution, which is \\(s = 0\\).\n\n4. **Formatting the Solution**:\n   - Since there is only one solution, we will provide it as a single decimal number.\n   - The solution is already in decimal form and does not require further conversion or rounding.\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer.\n\n<<<0.0000>>>"
