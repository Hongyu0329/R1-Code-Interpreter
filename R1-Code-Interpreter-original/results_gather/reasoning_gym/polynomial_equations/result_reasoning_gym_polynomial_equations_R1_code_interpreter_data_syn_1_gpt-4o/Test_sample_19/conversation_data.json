    "To solve the equation \\(-71h^3 + 182h = 0\\), we can start by factoring out the common term \\(h\\):\n\n\\[ h(-71h^2 + 182) = 0 \\]\n\nThis gives us two separate equations to solve:\n\n1. \\( h = 0 \\)\n2. \\(-71h^2 + 182 = 0\\)\n\nThe first equation \\( h = 0 \\) is straightforward and gives us one solution: \\( h = 0 \\).\n\nFor the second equation, we need to solve for \\( h \\):\n\n\\[-71h^2 + 182 = 0\\]\n\nRearranging gives:\n\n\\[ 71h^2 = 182 \\]\n\n\\[ h^2 = \\frac{182}{71} \\]\n\n\\[ h = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{182}{71}} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the decimal values for these solutions using Python.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the solutions\nh1 = 0\nh2 = math.sqrt(182 / 71)\nh3 = -math.sqrt(182 / 71)\n\n# Round the solutions to 4 decimal places\nh1 = round(h1, 4)\nh2 = round(h2, 4)\nh3 = round(h3, 4)\n\n# Print the solutions\nprint(h1, h2, h3)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, we will have the decimal values for the solutions.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the solutions to the equation \\(-71h^3 + 182h = 0\\). The solutions are:\n\n1. \\( h = 0 \\)\n2. \\( h = 1.6011 \\)\n3. \\( h = -1.6011 \\)\n\nThese are the real values of \\( h \\) that satisfy the equation. \n\n<<<0, 1.6011, -1.6011>>>"
