    "To solve the equation \\(27p = 0\\), we need to find the value of \\(p\\) that satisfies this equation.\n\n### Reasoning:\n1. The equation \\(27p = 0\\) is a simple linear equation.\n2. To solve for \\(p\\), we can divide both sides of the equation by 27.\n3. This will give us the value of \\(p\\).\n\nLet's perform the calculation:\n\n\\[\np = \\frac{0}{27} = 0\n\\]\n\nSince dividing zero by any non-zero number results in zero, the solution to the equation is \\(p = 0\\).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThere is only one real value for \\(p\\) that satisfies the equation, which is 0. According to the instructions, we need to provide the answer as a single decimal number rounded to four decimal places.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0.0000>>>"
