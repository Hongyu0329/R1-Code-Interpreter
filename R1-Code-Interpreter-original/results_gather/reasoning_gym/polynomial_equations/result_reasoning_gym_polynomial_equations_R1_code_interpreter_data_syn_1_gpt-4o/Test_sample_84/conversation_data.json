    "To solve the equation \\(-95z^3 + 62z^2 - 111 = 0\\), we need to find the real roots of this cubic equation. The process involves finding the roots using numerical methods since the equation does not easily factor into simpler polynomials.\n\n### Reasoning and Thinking Process\n\n1. **Identify the Type of Equation**: This is a cubic equation, which can have up to three real roots.\n\n2. **Numerical Methods**: Since the equation is not easily factorable, we will use numerical methods to find the roots. The most common method for finding roots of a polynomial is the Newton-Raphson method or using a numerical solver like the one provided in Python's `numpy` library.\n\n3. **Implementation**: We will use Python's `numpy` library to find the roots of the polynomial. The `numpy.roots` function can be used to find all roots (real and complex) of a polynomial.\n\n4. **Filter Real Roots**: After finding the roots, we will filter out the real roots and round them to four decimal places.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Coefficients of the polynomial -95z^3 + 62z^2 - 111 = 0\ncoefficients = [-95, 62, 0, -111]\n\n# Find the roots of the polynomial\nroots = np.roots(coefficients)\n\n# Filter real roots and round them to 4 decimal places\nreal_roots = [root.real for root in roots if np.isclose(root.imag, 0)]\nreal_roots_rounded = [round(root, 4) for root in real_roots]\n\n# Print the real roots as comma-separated values\nprint(','.join(map(str, real_roots_rounded)))\n```\n\nThis code will find the real roots of the given cubic equation and print them in the required format. Let's execute this code to find the solution.",
    "The code execution has provided us with one real root for the given cubic equation. Based on the output, we have determined the real root of the equation \\(-95z^3 + 62z^2 - 111 = 0\\).\n\nThe real root is:\n\n<<<-0.8747>>>"
