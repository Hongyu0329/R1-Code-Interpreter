    "To solve the equation \\(-9c^3 - 142c^2 - 27c = 0\\), we can start by factoring out the common term \\(c\\):\n\n\\[ c(-9c^2 - 142c - 27) = 0 \\]\n\nThis gives us one solution immediately: \\(c = 0\\).\n\nNext, we need to solve the quadratic equation \\(-9c^2 - 142c - 27 = 0\\). We can use the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[ c = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -9\\), \\(b = -142\\), and \\(c = -27\\).\n\nLet's calculate the discriminant and the roots using Python to ensure accuracy and to convert the solutions to decimal form.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coefficients\na = -9\nb = -142\nc = -27\n\n# Discriminant\ndiscriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c\n\n# Calculate roots\nif discriminant >= 0:\n    root1 = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)\n    root2 = (-b - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)\n    # Round the roots to 4 decimal places\n    root1 = round(root1, 4)\n    root2 = round(root2, 4)\n    print(f\"0, {root1}, {root2}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"0\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the roots.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the roots of the equation. We have three solutions: \\(c = 0\\), \\(c = -15.5853\\), and \\(c = -0.1925\\).\n\nThus, the real solutions to the equation \\(-9c^3 - 142c^2 - 27c = 0\\) are:\n\n<<<0, -15.5853, -0.1925>>>"
