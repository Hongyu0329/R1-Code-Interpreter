    "To solve the equation \\(187u + 69 = 0\\), we need to isolate the variable \\(u\\). Here is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with the equation:\n   \\[\n   187u + 69 = 0\n   \\]\n\n2. Subtract 69 from both sides to isolate the term with \\(u\\):\n   \\[\n   187u = -69\n   \\]\n\n3. Divide both sides by 187 to solve for \\(u\\):\n   \\[\n   u = \\frac{-69}{187}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the decimal value of \\(u\\) using Python to ensure accuracy and proper rounding.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of u\nu = -69 / 187\n# Print the result rounded to 4 decimal places\nprint(round(u, 4))\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will obtain the value of \\(u\\) rounded to four decimal places. Let's proceed with the calculation.",
    "The calculation has been completed successfully, and the value of \\( u \\) is \\(-0.369\\) when rounded to four decimal places. \n\nTherefore, the solution to the equation \\( 187u + 69 = 0 \\) is:\n\n<<<-0.369>>>"
