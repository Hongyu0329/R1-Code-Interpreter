    "To solve the equation \\(81x^3 + 57 = 0\\), we need to find the real value(s) of \\(x\\).\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n1. **Rearrange the Equation:**\n   \\[\n   81x^3 = -57\n   \\]\n\n2. **Solve for \\(x^3\\):**\n   \\[\n   x^3 = \\frac{-57}{81}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the Fraction:**\n   \\[\n   x^3 = -\\frac{19}{27}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Find the Cube Root:**\n   To find \\(x\\), we need to take the cube root of both sides:\n   \\[\n   x = \\sqrt[3]{-\\frac{19}{27}}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the Cube Root:**\n   We will use Python to compute the cube root and round the result to four decimal places.\n\n```python\n# Python code to calculate the cube root and round to 4 decimal places\nx_cubed = -19 / 27\nx = x_cubed ** (1/3)\nrounded_x = round(x, 4)\nprint(rounded_x)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the value of \\(x\\).",
    "The error indicates that the result of the cube root calculation is a complex number, which suggests that there are no real solutions to the equation. This happens because the cube root of a negative number can result in a complex number in some computational environments. However, mathematically, the cube root of a negative number should yield a real negative number.\n\nTo address this, we can use a different approach to ensure we get the real cube root. Let's modify the code to handle this correctly:\n\n```python\n# Python code to calculate the real cube root and round to 4 decimal places\nimport cmath\n\n# Calculate the cube root using cmath to handle negative numbers correctly\nx_cubed = -19 / 27\nx = cmath.exp(cmath.log(x_cubed) / 3).real\nrounded_x = round(x, 4)\nprint(rounded_x)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the real value of \\(x\\).",
    "It seems there was an error in the approach to calculate the real cube root. Let's correct this by using a more straightforward method to ensure we get the real cube root of a negative number. We can use the `math` library to handle this correctly:\n\n```python\n# Python code to calculate the real cube root and round to 4 decimal places\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the cube root of a negative number\nx_cubed = -19 / 27\nx = -math.pow(abs(x_cubed), 1/3)\nrounded_x = round(x, 4)\nprint(rounded_x)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the correct real value of \\(x\\).",
    "The calculation has been successfully executed, and the real value of \\(x\\) is \\(-0.8895\\). This is the only real solution to the equation \\(81x^3 + 57 = 0\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-0.8895>>>"
