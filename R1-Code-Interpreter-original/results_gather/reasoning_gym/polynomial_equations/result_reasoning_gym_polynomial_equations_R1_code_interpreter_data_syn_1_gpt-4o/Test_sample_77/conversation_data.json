    "To solve the equation \\(51k + 73 = 0\\) for the real value(s) of \\(k\\), we need to isolate \\(k\\). \n\nThe equation is linear, and we can solve it by performing the following steps:\n\n1. Subtract 73 from both sides to get:\n   \\[\n   51k = -73\n   \\]\n\n2. Divide both sides by 51 to solve for \\(k\\):\n   \\[\n   k = \\frac{-73}{51}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the decimal value of \\(k\\) and round it to four decimal places.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of k\nk = -73 / 51\n# Round the result to four decimal places\nk_rounded = round(k, 4)\nprint(k_rounded)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, we will have the value of \\(k\\) rounded to four decimal places.",
    "The calculation has been completed successfully, and the value of \\(k\\) is \\(-1.4314\\). Since this is a linear equation, there is only one solution.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-1.4314>>>"
