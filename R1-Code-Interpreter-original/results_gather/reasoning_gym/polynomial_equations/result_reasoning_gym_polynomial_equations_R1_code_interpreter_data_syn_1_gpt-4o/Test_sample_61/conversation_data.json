    "To solve the equation \\(-46r^3 - 51r^2 + 101 = 0\\), we need to find the real roots of this cubic equation. The general approach involves using numerical methods to approximate the roots since analytical solutions for cubic equations can be complex and cumbersome.\n\nLet's proceed with the following steps:\n\n1. **Identify the equation**: The equation is \\(-46r^3 - 51r^2 + 101 = 0\\).\n\n2. **Use numerical methods**: We can use a numerical solver to find the roots of the cubic equation. Python's `numpy` library provides a convenient function `numpy.roots` to find the roots of a polynomial.\n\n3. **Filter real roots**: Since the equation might have complex roots, we need to filter out only the real roots.\n\n4. **Round the results**: Round the real roots to four decimal places.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Coefficients of the polynomial -46r^3 - 51r^2 + 0*r + 101\ncoefficients = [-46, -51, 0, 101]\n\n# Find the roots of the polynomial\nroots = np.roots(coefficients)\n\n# Filter real roots and round them to 4 decimal places\nreal_roots = [round(root.real, 4) for root in roots if np.isclose(root.imag, 0)]\n\n# Print the real roots as a comma-separated string\nprint(\",\".join(map(str, real_roots)))\n```\n\nThis code will compute the roots of the given cubic equation, filter out the real roots, and round them to four decimal places. Let's execute this code to find the solution.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the real root of the cubic equation. Based on the output, the equation \\(-46r^3 - 51r^2 + 101 = 0\\) has one real root.\n\nThe real root, rounded to four decimal places, is:\n\n<<<1.0165>>>"
