    "To solve the equation \\(25k^2 - 15 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Rearrange the equation**: \n   \\[\n   25k^2 = 15\n   \\]\n\n2. **Divide both sides by 25**:\n   \\[\n   k^2 = \\frac{15}{25} = 0.6\n   \\]\n\n3. **Take the square root of both sides**:\n   \\[\n   k = \\pm \\sqrt{0.6}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the decimal values**:\n   We need to compute the square root of 0.6 and then provide the positive and negative solutions rounded to four decimal places.\n\nLet's calculate the square root of 0.6 and find the two solutions using Python code.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the square root of 0.6\nsqrt_value = math.sqrt(0.6)\n\n# Calculate the two possible values of k\nk1 = sqrt_value\nk2 = -sqrt_value\n\n# Round the results to four decimal places\nk1_rounded = round(k1, 4)\nk2_rounded = round(k2, 4)\n\n# Print the results\nprint(f\"{k2_rounded}, {k1_rounded}\")\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the two solutions for \\(k\\) rounded to four decimal places.",
    "The code execution has provided the two solutions for \\( k \\) as \\(-0.7746\\) and \\(0.7746\\). These are the real values that satisfy the equation \\(25k^2 - 15 = 0\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-0.7746, 0.7746>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Solve for real k: 25*k**2 - 15 = 0\nIn solving equations, please follow these instructions:\n1.
