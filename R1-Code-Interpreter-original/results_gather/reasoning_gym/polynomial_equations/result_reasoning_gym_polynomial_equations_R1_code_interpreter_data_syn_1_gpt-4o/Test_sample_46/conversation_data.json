    "To solve the polynomial equation \\(-164g = 0\\), we need to find the value of \\(g\\) that satisfies this equation.\n\n### Reasoning Process:\n1. The given equation is \\(-164g = 0\\).\n2. To solve for \\(g\\), we can divide both sides of the equation by \\(-164\\).\n3. This will give us \\(g = 0\\).\n\nSince this is a linear equation, there is only one solution for \\(g\\).\n\n### Code Execution:\nLet's write a simple Python script to solve this equation and confirm our solution.\n\n```python\n# Solving the equation -164*g = 0\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\ng = symbols('g')\n\n# Define the equation\nequation = Eq(-164*g, 0)\n\n# Solve the equation\nsolution = solve(equation, g)\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will get the solution for \\(g\\).\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe solution to the equation is a single value for \\(g\\). Since the equation is straightforward, the solution is:\n\n<<<0.0000>>>",
    "The code execution confirms that the solution to the equation \\(-164g = 0\\) is indeed \\(g = 0\\).\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe solution to the equation is:\n\n<<<0.0000>>>"
