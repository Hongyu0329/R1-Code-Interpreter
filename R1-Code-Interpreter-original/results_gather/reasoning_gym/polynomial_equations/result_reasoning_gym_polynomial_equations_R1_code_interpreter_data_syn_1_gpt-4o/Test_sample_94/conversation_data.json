    "To solve the equation \\(31u - 45 = 0\\), we need to isolate the variable \\(u\\). \n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Start with the equation: \n   \\[\n   31u - 45 = 0\n   \\]\n\n2. Add 45 to both sides to isolate the term with \\(u\\):\n   \\[\n   31u = 45\n   \\]\n\n3. Divide both sides by 31 to solve for \\(u\\):\n   \\[\n   u = \\frac{45}{31}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the decimal value of \\(\\frac{45}{31}\\) and round it to four decimal places.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of u\nu = 45 / 31\n# Round the result to four decimal places\nrounded_u = round(u, 4)\nprint(rounded_u)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the decimal value of \\(u\\) rounded to four decimal places. Let's see the result.",
    "The calculation of \\(u\\) from the equation \\(31u - 45 = 0\\) gives us a single solution. The value of \\(u\\) is calculated as \\(\\frac{45}{31}\\), which is approximately 1.4516 when rounded to four decimal places.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1.4516>>>"
