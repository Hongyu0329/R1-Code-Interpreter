    "To solve the equation \\(13y^3 + 38y^2 = 0\\), we can start by factoring the expression. \n\nThe equation can be rewritten as:\n\\[ y^2(13y + 38) = 0 \\]\n\nThis gives us two possible cases to solve:\n1. \\( y^2 = 0 \\)\n2. \\( 13y + 38 = 0 \\)\n\nLet's solve these cases:\n\n1. \\( y^2 = 0 \\) implies \\( y = 0 \\).\n\n2. \\( 13y + 38 = 0 \\) can be solved for \\( y \\) as follows:\n   \\[ 13y = -38 \\]\n   \\[ y = -\\frac{38}{13} \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the decimal value for \\( y = -\\frac{38}{13} \\) and round it to four decimal places.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the decimal value of y = -38/13\ny_value = -38 / 13\nprint(round(y_value, 4))\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the decimal value for the second solution. Then, we can provide the final answer with both solutions rounded to four decimal places.",
    "The code execution has provided the decimal value for the second solution. Now, we have the solutions for the equation:\n\n1. \\( y = 0 \\)\n2. \\( y = -2.9231 \\)\n\nBoth solutions are real numbers, and we need to present them as comma-separated decimal values rounded to four decimal places.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0.0000, -2.9231>>>"
