    "To solve the equation \\(125 \\cdot g^3 = 0\\), we need to find the real value(s) of \\(g\\) that satisfy this equation.\n\n### Reasoning Process:\n\n1. **Equation Simplification**: \n   - The equation is \\(125 \\cdot g^3 = 0\\).\n   - We can divide both sides of the equation by 125 (since 125 is not zero), which simplifies the equation to \\(g^3 = 0\\).\n\n2. **Solving for \\(g\\)**:\n   - The equation \\(g^3 = 0\\) implies that \\(g\\) must be a number whose cube is zero.\n   - The only real number that satisfies this condition is \\(g = 0\\).\n\n3. **Verification**:\n   - Substituting \\(g = 0\\) back into the original equation: \\(125 \\cdot 0^3 = 0\\), which holds true.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - There is only one real solution to the equation, which is \\(g = 0\\).\n\nNow, let's format the solution according to the instructions:\n\n- Since there is only one solution, we will provide a single decimal number.\n- The solution is \\(g = 0\\), which is already in decimal form.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
