    "To solve the equation \\(3 - a = 0\\), we need to find the value of \\(a\\) that makes the equation true.\n\n### Reasoning Process:\n1. Start with the equation: \\(3 - a = 0\\).\n2. To isolate \\(a\\), add \\(a\\) to both sides of the equation: \\(3 = a\\).\n3. Therefore, the solution to the equation is \\(a = 3\\).\n\nSince this is a simple linear equation, there is only one solution. We will provide the answer in the required format.\n\n<<<3.0000>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Determine the real value(s) of a that satisfies: 3 - a = 0\nIn solving equations, please follow these instructions:\n1.
