For solutions that can be expressed in exact form (like \"u = 2 + sqrt(4560)/172\" and \"u = 2 - sqrt(4560)/172\"), convert them to decimal form in your final answer.\n3. If there are no real values that satisfy the equation, report your answer as an empty string: \"\"\n4. Format your answer based on the number of solutions:\n   - For 1 solution: a single decimal number\n   - For 2 solutions: two comma-separated decimal numbers\n   - For 3 or more solutions: all values as comma-separated decimal numbers\n   - Enclose the answer within triple angle brackets, like <<<number/numbers>>>.\n5. Round all decimal values to 4 decimal places (rounding down when the 5th decimal place is 5 or greater).\n",

    "To solve the equation \\(68o - 86 = 0\\), we need to isolate the variable \\(o\\). Here is the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Start with the equation:  \n   \\(68o - 86 = 0\\)\n\n2. Add 86 to both sides to isolate the term with \\(o\\):  \n   \\(68o = 86\\)\n\n3. Divide both sides by 68 to solve for \\(o\\):  \n   \\(o = \\frac{86}{68}\\)\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of \\(o\\) using Python to ensure accuracy and to follow the instruction of using code for computation.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the value of o\no = 86 / 68\n# Print the result rounded to 4 decimal places\nprint(round(o, 4))\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the value of \\(o\\) rounded to four decimal places.",
    "The code execution has provided the value of \\(o\\) as 1.2647. This is the solution to the equation \\(68o - 86 = 0\\).\n\nFollowing the instructions for formatting the answer, since there is only one solution, we present it as a single decimal number.\n\n<<<1.2647>>>"
