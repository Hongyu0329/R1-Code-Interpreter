    "To solve the equation \\(115z^2 - 43 = 0\\), we need to find the real values of \\(z\\) that satisfy this equation. This is a quadratic equation of the form \\(az^2 + bz + c = 0\\), where \\(a = 115\\), \\(b = 0\\), and \\(c = -43\\).\n\nThe solutions to a quadratic equation \\(az^2 + bz + c = 0\\) can be found using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nz = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[\nz = \\frac{-0 \\pm \\sqrt{0^2 - 4 \\times 115 \\times (-43)}}{2 \\times 115}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying further:\n\n\\[\nz = \\frac{\\pm \\sqrt{4 \\times 115 \\times 43}}{230}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the discriminant and the solutions using Python to ensure accuracy and rounding to four decimal places.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coefficients\na = 115\nb = 0\nc = -43\n\n# Calculate the discriminant\ndiscriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c\n\n# Calculate the two solutions\nz1 = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)\nz2 = (-b - math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)\n\n# Round the solutions to four decimal places\nz1 = round(z1, 4)\nz2 = round(z2, 4)\n\nprint(f\"{z1}, {z2}\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the solutions.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the solutions to the quadratic equation. The real values of \\( z \\) that satisfy the equation \\( 115z^2 - 43 = 0 \\) are \\( 0.6115 \\) and \\( -0.6115 \\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0.6115, -0.6115>>>"
