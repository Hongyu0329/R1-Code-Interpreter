    "To solve the cubic equation \\(86q^3 - 96q^2 - 98q - 86 = 0\\), we need to find the real roots. A cubic equation can have either one real root or three real roots. We will use numerical methods to find the roots of this equation.\n\nThe most straightforward approach is to use a numerical solver to find the roots of the polynomial. In Python, we can use the `numpy` library, which provides a function `numpy.roots()` to find the roots of a polynomial.\n\nLet's write a Python script to find the roots of the given cubic equation and then filter out the real roots. We'll round the results to four decimal places as required.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Coefficients of the polynomial 86*q**3 - 96*q**2 - 98*q - 86 = 0\ncoefficients = [86, -96, -98, -86]\n\n# Find the roots of the polynomial\nroots = np.roots(coefficients)\n\n# Filter real roots and round them to 4 decimal places\nreal_roots = [round(root.real, 4) for root in roots if np.isclose(root.imag, 0)]\n\n# Print the real roots as a comma-separated string\nprint(', '.join(map(str, real_roots)))\n```\n\nThis code will compute the roots of the polynomial, filter out the real roots, and print them in the required format. Let's execute this code to find the solution.",
    "The code execution has provided us with one real root for the cubic equation. According to the instructions, if there is only one real solution, we should format it as a single decimal number.\n\nTherefore, the final answer for the real value of \\( q \\) that satisfies the equation \\( 86q^3 - 96q^2 - 98q - 86 = 0 \\) is:\n\n<<<1.9587>>>"
