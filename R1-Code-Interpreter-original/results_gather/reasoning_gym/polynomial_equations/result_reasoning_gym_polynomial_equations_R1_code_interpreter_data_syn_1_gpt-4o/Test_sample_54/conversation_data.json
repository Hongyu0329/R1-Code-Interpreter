    "To solve the equation \\(91a^3 + 12 = 0\\), we need to find the real value(s) of \\(a\\).\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n1. **Rearrange the Equation:**\n   \\[\n   91a^3 = -12\n   \\]\n\n2. **Solve for \\(a^3\\):**\n   \\[\n   a^3 = \\frac{-12}{91}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Find the Cube Root:**\n   \\[\n   a = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{-12}{91}}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's compute the cube root of \\(-\\frac{12}{91}\\) to find the real value of \\(a\\).\n\n```python\n# Python code to compute the cube root of -12/91\na_cubed = -12 / 91\na = a_cubed ** (1/3)\nprint(round(a, 4))\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will have the real value of \\(a\\) rounded to four decimal places. Let's proceed with the calculation.",
    "The error indicates that the result of the cube root calculation is a complex number, which means there are no real solutions for the equation. This happens because the cube root of a negative number can result in a complex number when using certain computational methods.\n\nTo find the real cube root of a negative number, we should use a different approach that ensures we get the real root. Let's adjust the code to handle this correctly.\n\n```python\n# Python code to compute the real cube root of -12/91\na_cubed = -12 / 91\n# Calculate the real cube root\na = -abs(a_cubed) ** (1/3)\nprint(round(a, 4))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the real value of \\(a\\).",
    "The code execution has provided us with the real value of \\(a\\) for the equation \\(91a^3 + 12 = 0\\). The real solution is:\n\n<<<-0.509>>>"
