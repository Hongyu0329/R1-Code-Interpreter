  "question": "Solve for real z: z**2 - 85*z = 0\nIn solving equations, please follow these instructions:\n1. Provide all answers as comma-separated decimal values. For example: \"-0.3773, 0.4005\"\n2. For solutions that can be expressed in exact form (like \"u = 2 + sqrt(4560)/172\" and \"u = 2 - sqrt(4560)/172\"), convert them to decimal form in your final answer.\n3. If there are no real values that satisfy the equation, report your answer as an empty string: \"\"\n4. Format your answer based on the number of solutions:\n   - For 1 solution: a single decimal number\n   - For 2 solutions: two comma-separated decimal numbers\n   - For 3 or more solutions: all values as comma-separated decimal numbers\n   - Enclose the answer within triple angle brackets, like <<<number/numbers>>>.\n5. Round all decimal values to 4 decimal places (rounding down when the 5th decimal place is 5 or greater).\n",

    "\nassistant > To solve the equation \\( z^2 - 85z = 0 \\), we can factor it as follows:\n\n\\[ z(z - 85) = 0 \\]\n\nThis equation is satisfied when either \\( z = 0 \\) or \\( z - 85 = 0 \\). Solving for \\( z \\) gives us the solutions:\n\n1. \\( z = 0 \\)\n2. \\( z = 85 \\)\n\nBoth solutions are real numbers. Let's express them in the required format.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Solutions\nz1 = 0\nz2 = 85\n\n# Format the solutions as a comma-separated string with 4 decimal places\nsolutions = f\"{z1:.4f}, {z2:.4f}\"\nsolutions\nassistant > The solutions to the equation are <<<0.0000, 85.0000>>>."
