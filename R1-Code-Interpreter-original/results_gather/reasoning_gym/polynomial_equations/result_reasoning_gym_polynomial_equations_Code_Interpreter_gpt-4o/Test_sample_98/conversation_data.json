  "question": "Determine the real value(s) of s that satisfies: -21*s**2 = 0\nIn solving equations, please follow these instructions:\n1. Provide all answers as comma-separated decimal values. For example: \"-0.3773, 0.4005\"\n2. For solutions that can be expressed in exact form (like \"u = 2 + sqrt(4560)/172\" and \"u = 2 - sqrt(4560)/172\"), convert them to decimal form in your final answer.\n3. If there are no real values that satisfy the equation, report your answer as an empty string: \"\"\n4. Format your answer based on the number of solutions:\n   - For 1 solution: a single decimal number\n   - For 2 solutions: two comma-separated decimal numbers\n   - For 3 or more solutions: all values as comma-separated decimal numbers\n   - Enclose the answer within triple angle brackets, like <<<number/numbers>>>.\n5. Round all decimal values to 4 decimal places (rounding down when the 5th decimal place is 5 or greater).\n",

    "\nassistant > To solve the equation \\(-21s^2 = 0\\), we can start by dividing both sides by \\(-21\\) to isolate \\(s^2\\):\n\n\\[ s^2 = 0 \\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we find:\n\n\\[ s = 0 \\]\n\nThis equation has only one real solution. Let's format the answer according to the given instructions.\nassistant > The solution to the equation is:\n\n\\[ s = 0 \\]\n\nAccording to the instructions, for a single solution, we provide the answer as a single decimal number. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<0.0000>>>"
