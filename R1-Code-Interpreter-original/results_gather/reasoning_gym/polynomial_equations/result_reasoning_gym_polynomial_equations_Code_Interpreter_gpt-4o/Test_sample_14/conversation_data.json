  "question": "Solve for real c: 106*c**2 = 0\nIn solving equations, please follow these instructions:\n1. Provide all answers as comma-separated decimal values. For example: \"-0.3773, 0.4005\"\n2. For solutions that can be expressed in exact form (like \"u = 2 + sqrt(4560)/172\" and \"u = 2 - sqrt(4560)/172\"), convert them to decimal form in your final answer.\n3. If there are no real values that satisfy the equation, report your answer as an empty string: \"\"\n4. Format your answer based on the number of solutions:\n   - For 1 solution: a single decimal number\n   - For 2 solutions: two comma-separated decimal numbers\n   - For 3 or more solutions: all values as comma-separated decimal numbers\n   - Enclose the answer within triple angle brackets, like <<<number/numbers>>>.\n5. Round all decimal values to 4 decimal places (rounding down when the 5th decimal place is 5 or greater).\n",

    "\nassistant > To solve the equation \\(106c^2 = 0\\), we can start by dividing both sides by 106:\n\n\\[ c^2 = 0 \\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we find:\n\n\\[ c = 0 \\]\n\nThis equation has only one real solution. Therefore, the solution is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Solution: } c = 0\n\\]\n\nFollowing the instructions, the answer should be formatted as a single decimal number rounded to four decimal places. Thus, the solution is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Answer: } <<<0.0000>>>\n\\]"
