  "question": "Solve for real u: -60*u - 86 = 0\nIn solving equations, please follow these instructions:\n1. Provide all answers as comma-separated decimal values. For example: \"-0.3773, 0.4005\"\n2. For solutions that can be expressed in exact form (like \"u = 2 + sqrt(4560)/172\" and \"u = 2 - sqrt(4560)/172\"), convert them to decimal form in your final answer.\n3. If there are no real values that satisfy the equation, report your answer as an empty string: \"\"\n4. Format your answer based on the number of solutions:\n   - For 1 solution: a single decimal number\n   - For 2 solutions: two comma-separated decimal numbers\n   - For 3 or more solutions: all values as comma-separated decimal numbers\n   - Enclose the answer within triple angle brackets, like <<<number/numbers>>>.\n5. Round all decimal values to 4 decimal places (rounding down when the 5th decimal place is 5 or greater).\n",

    "\nassistant > To solve the equation \\(-60u - 86 = 0\\) for \\(u\\), we can isolate \\(u\\) by following these steps:\n\n1. Add 86 to both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   -60u = 86\n   \\]\n\n2. Divide both sides by -60 to solve for \\(u\\):\n   \\[\n   u = \\frac{86}{-60}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of \\(u\\) and round it to four decimal places.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Calculate the value of u\nu = 86 / -60\n\n# Round the result to four decimal places\nu_rounded = round(u, 4)\nu_rounded\nassistant > The solution to the equation \\(-60u - 86 = 0\\) is:\n\n\\[ u = -1.4333 \\]\n\nThus, the answer is: <<<-1.4333>>>."
