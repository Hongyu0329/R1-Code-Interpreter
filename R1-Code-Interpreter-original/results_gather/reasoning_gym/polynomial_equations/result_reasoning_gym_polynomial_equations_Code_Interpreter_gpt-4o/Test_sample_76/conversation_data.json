    "\nassistant > To solve the equation \\(-68 \\cdot e^3 = 0\\), we can start by dividing both sides of the equation by \\(-68\\), which simplifies the equation to:\n\n\\[ e^3 = 0 \\]\n\nNext, we take the cube root of both sides to solve for \\(e\\):\n\n\\[ e = \\sqrt[3]{0} \\]\n\nLet's calculate the value of \\(e\\).\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Calculate the cube root of 0\ne_value = 0 ** (1/3)\ne_value\nassistant > The real value of \\( e \\) that satisfies the equation is \\( 0.0 \\).\n\nThus, the solution is: <<<0.0>>>."
