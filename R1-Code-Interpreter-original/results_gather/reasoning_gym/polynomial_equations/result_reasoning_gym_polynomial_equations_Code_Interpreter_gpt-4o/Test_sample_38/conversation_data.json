For example: \"-0.3773, 0.4005\"\n2. For solutions that can be expressed in exact form (like \"u = 2 + sqrt(4560)/172\" and \"u = 2 - sqrt(4560)/172\"), convert them to decimal form in your final answer.\n3. If there are no real values that satisfy the equation, report your answer as an empty string: \"\"\n4. Format your answer based on the number of solutions:\n   - For 1 solution: a single decimal number\n   - For 2 solutions: two comma-separated decimal numbers\n   - For 3 or more solutions: all values as comma-separated decimal numbers\n   - Enclose the answer within triple angle brackets, like <<<number/numbers>>>.\n5.

    "\nassistant > To solve the polynomial equation \\(100 - 112o = 0\\), we can isolate \\(o\\) by performing the following steps:\n\n1. Subtract 100 from both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   -112o = -100\n   \\]\n\n2. Divide both sides by -112 to solve for \\(o\\):\n   \\[\n   o = \\frac{-100}{-112}\n   \\]\n\nLet's calculate the value of \\(o\\).\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Calculate the value of o\no = -100 / -112\n# Round the result to 4 decimal places\no_rounded = round(o, 4)\no_rounded\nassistant > The solution to the equation \\(100 - 112o = 0\\) is \\(o = 0.8929\\). Therefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<0.8929>>>"
