    "To solve the quadratic equation \\(4h^2 + 115h + 33 = 0\\), we will use the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[ h = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nwhere \\(a = 4\\), \\(b = 115\\), and \\(c = 33\\).\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the discriminant (\\(b^2 - 4ac\\))**\n\n\\[ b^2 = 115^2 = 13225 \\]\n\\[ 4ac = 4 \\times 4 \\times 33 = 528 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Discriminant} = 13225 - 528 = 12697 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Check the discriminant**\n\nSince the discriminant is positive (\\(12697 > 0\\)), there are two distinct real solutions.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the solutions using the quadratic formula**\n\n\\[ h = \\frac{-115 \\pm \\sqrt{12697}}{8} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate \\(\\sqrt{12697}\\)**\n\nUsing a calculator, \\(\\sqrt{12697} \\approx 112.6931\\).\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the two solutions**\n\n1. First solution:\n   \\[ h_1 = \\frac{-115 + 112.6931}{8} = \\frac{-2.3069}{8} \\approx -0.2883 \\]\n\n2. Second solution:\n   \\[ h_2 = \\frac{-115 - 112.6931}{8} = \\frac{-227.6931}{8} \\approx -28.4616 \\]\n\n**Step 6: Round the solutions to four decimal places**\n\n- \\(h_1 \\approx -0.2883\\)\n- \\(h_2 \\approx -28.4616\\)\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe real values of \\(h\\) that satisfy the equation are:\n\n<<<-0.2883, -28.4616>>>"
