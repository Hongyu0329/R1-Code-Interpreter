    "To solve the equation \\(3 - a = 0\\), we need to find the value of \\(a\\) that makes the equation true.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the equation**: The given equation is \\(3 - a = 0\\).\n\n2. **Isolate the variable**: To find the value of \\(a\\), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by adding \\(a\\) to both sides of the equation:\n\n   \\[\n   3 = a\n   \\]\n\n3. **Verify the solution**: Substitute \\(a = 3\\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:\n\n   \\[\n   3 - 3 = 0\n   \\]\n\n   This simplifies to \\(0 = 0\\), which is true.\n\n4. **Determine the number of solutions**: The equation \\(3 - a = 0\\) is a linear equation, and linear equations typically have one solution. In this case, the solution is \\(a = 3\\).\n\n5. **Format the answer**: Since there is one solution, we provide the answer as a single decimal number. The solution \\(a = 3\\) is already in decimal form and does not require further conversion. According to the instructions, we round to four decimal places, but since 3 is an integer, it remains 3.0000.\n\n6. **Enclose the answer**: Finally, we enclose the answer within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<3.0000>>>"
