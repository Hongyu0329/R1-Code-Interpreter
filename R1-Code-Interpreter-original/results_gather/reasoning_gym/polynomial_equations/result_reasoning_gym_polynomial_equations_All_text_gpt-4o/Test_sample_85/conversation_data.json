    "To solve the equation \\(52h - 72 = 0\\) for the real value(s) of \\(h\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Isolate the variable \\(h\\):**\n   - Start with the equation: \\(52h - 72 = 0\\).\n   - Add 72 to both sides to isolate the term with \\(h\\): \n     \\[\n     52h = 72\n     \\]\n\n2. **Solve for \\(h\\):**\n   - Divide both sides by 52 to solve for \\(h\\):\n     \\[\n     h = \\frac{72}{52}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the fraction:**\n   - Simplify \\(\\frac{72}{52}\\) by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 72 and 52, which is 4.\n   - Divide both the numerator and the denominator by 4:\n     \\[\n     h = \\frac{72 \\div 4}{52 \\div 4} = \\frac{18}{13}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Convert to decimal form:**\n   - Calculate the decimal value of \\(\\frac{18}{13}\\):\n     \\[\n     h \\approx 1.38461538461538\n     \\]\n\n5. **Round the decimal value:**\n   - Round 1.38461538461538 to four decimal places:\n     \\[\n     h \\approx 1.3846\n     \\]\n\n6. **Format the answer:**\n   - Since there is only one solution, format the answer as a single decimal number enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<1.3846>>>"
