    "To solve the equation \\(39 - 53f^2 = 0\\) for real \\(f\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Rearrange the Equation**: Start by isolating the term with \\(f\\).\n   \\[\n   39 - 53f^2 = 0 \\implies 53f^2 = 39\n   \\]\n\n2. **Solve for \\(f^2\\)**: Divide both sides by 53 to solve for \\(f^2\\).\n   \\[\n   f^2 = \\frac{39}{53}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(f\\)**: Take the square root of both sides to solve for \\(f\\). Remember that taking the square root will yield two solutions, one positive and one negative.\n   \\[\n   f = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{39}{53}}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate Decimal Values**: Compute the decimal values for the solutions.\n   - First, calculate \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{39}{53}}\\).\n   - \\(\\frac{39}{53} \\approx 0.7358\\)\n   - \\(\\sqrt{0.7358} \\approx 0.8577\\)\n\n5. **Determine the Solutions**: The solutions for \\(f\\) are:\n   - \\(f = 0.8577\\)\n   - \\(f = -0.8577\\)\n\n6. **Format the Answer**: Since there are two solutions, we will list them as comma-separated decimal numbers.\n\nThe final answer, rounded to four decimal places, is:\n\n<<<-0.8577, 0.8577>>>"
