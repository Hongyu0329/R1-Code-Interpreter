    "To solve the equation \\(-6u - 52 = 0\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Isolate the variable \\(u\\):**\n   - Start with the equation: \\(-6u - 52 = 0\\).\n   - Add 52 to both sides to isolate the term with \\(u\\): \\(-6u = 52\\).\n\n2. **Solve for \\(u\\):**\n   - Divide both sides by \\(-6\\) to solve for \\(u\\): \n     \\[\n     u = \\frac{52}{-6}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the fraction:**\n   - Calculate the division: \n     \\[\n     u = -\\frac{52}{6} = -\\frac{26}{3}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Convert to decimal form:**\n   - Perform the division to convert \\(-\\frac{26}{3}\\) to a decimal:\n     \\[\n     u = -8.6666\\ldots\n     \\]\n\n5. **Round the decimal:**\n   - Round \\(-8.6666\\ldots\\) to four decimal places:\n     \\[\n     u = -8.6666\n     \\]\n\n6. **Format the answer:**\n   - Since there is only one solution, we format it as a single decimal number within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<-8.6666>>>"
