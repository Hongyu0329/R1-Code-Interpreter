    "To solve the polynomial equation \\(27t^2 = 0\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the type of equation**: The given equation is a quadratic equation in the form \\(at^2 + bt + c = 0\\), where \\(a = 27\\), \\(b = 0\\), and \\(c = 0\\).\n\n2. **Simplify the equation**: Divide both sides of the equation by 27 to simplify it:\n   \\[\n   t^2 = 0\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(t\\)**: The equation \\(t^2 = 0\\) implies that \\(t\\) must be a value that, when squared, equals zero. The only real number that satisfies this condition is:\n   \\[\n   t = 0\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the number of solutions**: Since \\(t^2 = 0\\) has only one solution, \\(t = 0\\), we have a single solution.\n\n5. **Format the solution**: According to the instructions, for a single solution, we provide the answer as a single decimal number. The solution \\(t = 0\\) is already in decimal form.\n\n6. **Round the solution**: The solution \\(t = 0\\) does not require rounding as it is already a whole number.\n\n7. **Enclose the answer**: Finally, we enclose the answer within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n<<<0>>>\n\\]"
