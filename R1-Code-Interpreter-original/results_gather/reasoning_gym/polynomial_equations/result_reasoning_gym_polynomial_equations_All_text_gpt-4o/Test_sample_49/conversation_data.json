    "To solve the equation \\(5s^2 = 0\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The given equation is \\(5s^2 = 0\\). This is a quadratic equation in the form of \\(as^2 + bs + c = 0\\), where \\(a = 5\\), \\(b = 0\\), and \\(c = 0\\).\n\n2. **Simplify the Equation**: Divide both sides of the equation by 5 to simplify it:\n   \\[\n   s^2 = 0\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(s\\)**: To find the value of \\(s\\), take the square root of both sides:\n   \\[\n   s = \\sqrt{0}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   s = 0\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the Number of Solutions**: The equation \\(s^2 = 0\\) has only one solution, which is \\(s = 0\\).\n\n5. **Format the Answer**: Since there is only one solution, we will provide it as a single decimal number. According to the instructions, we need to round to four decimal places. The value \\(0\\) remains \\(0.0000\\) when rounded to four decimal places.\n\n6. **Final Answer**: Enclose the answer within triple angle brackets as specified.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0.0000>>>"
