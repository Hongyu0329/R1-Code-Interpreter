    "To solve the equation \\(115z^2 - 43 = 0\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Rearrange the Equation**: Start by isolating the term with \\(z\\).\n   \\[\n   115z^2 = 43\n   \\]\n\n2. **Solve for \\(z^2\\)**: Divide both sides by 115 to solve for \\(z^2\\).\n   \\[\n   z^2 = \\frac{43}{115}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Decimal Value**: Compute the decimal value of \\(\\frac{43}{115}\\).\n   \\[\n   z^2 = 0.3739130434782609\n   \\]\n\n4. **Take the Square Root**: Solve for \\(z\\) by taking the square root of both sides. Remember that there are two possible solutions, one positive and one negative.\n   \\[\n   z = \\pm \\sqrt{0.3739130434782609}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the Square Roots**: Compute the square roots and round to four decimal places.\n   - Positive root: \\(\\sqrt{0.3739130434782609} \\approx 0.6115\\)\n   - Negative root: \\(-\\sqrt{0.3739130434782609} \\approx -0.6115\\)\n\n6. **Format the Answer**: Since there are two solutions, we list them as comma-separated decimal values.\n\nThe final answer, rounded to four decimal places, is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Answer: } <<<-0.6115, 0.6115>>>\n\\]"
