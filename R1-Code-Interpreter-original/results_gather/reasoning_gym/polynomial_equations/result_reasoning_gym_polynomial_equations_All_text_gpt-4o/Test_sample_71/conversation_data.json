    "To solve the equation \\(44 - 95y^2 = 0\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Rearrange the Equation**: Start by isolating the term with \\(y\\).\n   \\[\n   44 - 95y^2 = 0 \\implies 95y^2 = 44\n   \\]\n\n2. **Solve for \\(y^2\\)**: Divide both sides by 95 to solve for \\(y^2\\).\n   \\[\n   y^2 = \\frac{44}{95}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Take the Square Root**: To find \\(y\\), take the square root of both sides. Remember that taking the square root will yield both positive and negative solutions.\n   \\[\n   y = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{44}{95}}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Decimal Values**: Compute the square root and convert it to decimal form.\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{\\frac{44}{95}} \\approx 0.6810\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, the solutions for \\(y\\) are:\n   \\[\n   y = 0.6810 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad y = -0.6810\n   \\]\n\n5. **Format the Answer**: Since there are two solutions, we list them as comma-separated decimal values.\n\nThe final answer, rounded to four decimal places, is:\n\\[\n\\text{<<<-0.6810, 0.6810>>>}\n\\]"
