    "To solve the equation \\(181q^3 + 61 = 0\\), we need to find the real value(s) of \\(q\\) that satisfy this equation. Let's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Rearrange the Equation:**\n   \\[\n   181q^3 + 61 = 0\n   \\]\n   Subtract 61 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   181q^3 = -61\n   \\]\n\n2. **Isolate \\(q^3\\):**\n   Divide both sides by 181:\n   \\[\n   q^3 = -\\frac{61}{181}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(q\\):**\n   To find \\(q\\), take the cube root of both sides:\n   \\[\n   q = \\sqrt[3]{-\\frac{61}{181}}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Cube Root:**\n   We need to compute the cube root of \\(-\\frac{61}{181}\\). First, calculate the decimal value of \\(-\\frac{61}{181}\\):\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{61}{181} \\approx -0.3365\n   \\]\n\n   Now, find the cube root of \\(-0.3365\\):\n   \\[\n   q \\approx \\sqrt[3]{-0.3365} \\approx -0.6985\n   \\]\n\n5. **Round the Result:**\n   The value of \\(q\\) is approximately \\(-0.6985\\) when rounded to four decimal places.\n\nSince this is a cubic equation and we have found one real root, it is the only real solution. Cubic equations can have one real root and two complex roots, but we are only interested in real solutions here.\n\nTherefore, the real value of \\(q\\) that satisfies the equation is:\n\n<<<-0.6985>>>"
