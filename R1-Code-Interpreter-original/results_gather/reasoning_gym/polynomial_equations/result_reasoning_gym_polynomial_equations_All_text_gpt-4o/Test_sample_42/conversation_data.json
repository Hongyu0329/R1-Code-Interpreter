    "To solve the equation \\(16v^3 + 24v^2 = 0\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Factor the equation**: \n   The given equation is \\(16v^3 + 24v^2 = 0\\). We can factor out the greatest common factor, which is \\(8v^2\\), from both terms:\n   \\[\n   8v^2(2v + 3) = 0\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set each factor to zero**:\n   We have two factors: \\(8v^2\\) and \\(2v + 3\\). We set each factor equal to zero to find the solutions for \\(v\\).\n\n   - **First factor**: \\(8v^2 = 0\\)\n     \\[\n     v^2 = 0 \\implies v = 0\n     \\]\n\n   - **Second factor**: \\(2v + 3 = 0\\)\n     \\[\n     2v = -3 \\implies v = -\\frac{3}{2}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Convert solutions to decimal form**:\n   - The solution \\(v = 0\\) is already in decimal form.\n   - The solution \\(v = -\\frac{3}{2}\\) can be converted to decimal form as:\n     \\[\n     v = -1.5\n     \\]\n\n4. **List all solutions**:\n   We have two solutions: \\(v = 0\\) and \\(v = -1.5\\).\n\n5. **Format the answer**:\n   Since there are two solutions, we list them as comma-separated decimal numbers.\n\nThe final answer, rounded to four decimal places, is:\n<<<-1.5000, 0.0000>>>"
