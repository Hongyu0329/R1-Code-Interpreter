    "To solve the equation \\(68o - 86 = 0\\) for the real number \\(o\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Isolate the variable \\(o\\):**\n   - Start with the equation: \\(68o - 86 = 0\\).\n   - Add 86 to both sides to isolate the term with \\(o\\): \n     \\[\n     68o = 86\n     \\]\n\n2. **Solve for \\(o\\):**\n   - Divide both sides by 68 to solve for \\(o\\):\n     \\[\n     o = \\frac{86}{68}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the fraction:**\n   - Simplify \\(\\frac{86}{68}\\) by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 86 and 68, which is 2.\n   - Divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2:\n     \\[\n     o = \\frac{43}{34}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Convert to decimal form:**\n   - Calculate the decimal value of \\(\\frac{43}{34}\\):\n     \\[\n     o \\approx 1.2647\n     \\]\n\n5. **Round the decimal value:**\n   - Round 1.2647 to four decimal places. Since the fifth decimal place is 7, we round up:\n     \\[\n     o = 1.2647\n     \\]\n\n6. **Format the answer:**\n   - Since there is only one solution, we provide the answer as a single decimal number.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<1.2647>>>"
