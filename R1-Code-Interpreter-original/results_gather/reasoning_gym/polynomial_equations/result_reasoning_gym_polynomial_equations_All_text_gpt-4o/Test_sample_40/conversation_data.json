    "To solve the equation \\(40c^3 + 107c^2 + 88c = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Factor out the common term**: Notice that each term in the equation has a factor of \\(c\\). We can factor \\(c\\) out of the equation:\n   \\[\n   c(40c^2 + 107c + 88) = 0\n   \\]\n   This gives us one solution immediately: \\(c = 0\\).\n\n2. **Solve the quadratic equation**: Now, we need to solve the quadratic equation \\(40c^2 + 107c + 88 = 0\\).\n\n3. **Use the quadratic formula**: The quadratic formula is given by:\n   \\[\n   c = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n   \\]\n   where \\(a = 40\\), \\(b = 107\\), and \\(c = 88\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the discriminant**: The discriminant \\(\\Delta\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta = b^2 - 4ac = 107^2 - 4 \\times 40 \\times 88\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Delta = 11449 - 14080 = -1631\n   \\]\n   Since the discriminant is negative, the quadratic equation has no real solutions.\n\n5. **Compile the real solutions**: The only real solution from the factorization step is \\(c = 0\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer, considering the instructions for formatting, is:\n\n<<<0.0000>>>"
