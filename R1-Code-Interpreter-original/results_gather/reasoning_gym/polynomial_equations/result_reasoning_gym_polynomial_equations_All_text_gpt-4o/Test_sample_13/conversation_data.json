    "To solve the equation \\(98 - 94d^2 = 0\\) for real \\(d\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Rearrange the Equation**: Start by isolating the term with \\(d\\).\n   \\[\n   98 = 94d^2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Solve for \\(d^2\\)**: Divide both sides by 94 to solve for \\(d^2\\).\n   \\[\n   d^2 = \\frac{98}{94}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the Fraction**: Simplify \\(\\frac{98}{94}\\).\n   \\[\n   \\frac{98}{94} = \\frac{49}{47}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Take the Square Root**: Solve for \\(d\\) by taking the square root of both sides. Remember that taking the square root will yield two solutions, one positive and one negative.\n   \\[\n   d = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{49}{47}}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the Decimal Values**: Compute the decimal values for \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{49}{47}}\\).\n   - First, calculate \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{49}{47}}\\).\n   - \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{49}{47}} \\approx 1.0153\\)\n\n6. **Determine the Solutions**: The solutions for \\(d\\) are:\n   - \\(d = 1.0153\\)\n   - \\(d = -1.0153\\)\n\n7. **Format the Answer**: Since there are two solutions, list them as comma-separated decimal numbers rounded to four decimal places.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<-1.0153, 1.0153>>>"
