    "To solve the equation \\(-47s^3 - 50 = 0\\) for real \\(s\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Rearrange the Equation**: Start by isolating the cubic term:\n   \\[\n   -47s^3 = 50\n   \\]\n\n2. **Solve for \\(s^3\\)**: Divide both sides by \\(-47\\) to solve for \\(s^3\\):\n   \\[\n   s^3 = -\\frac{50}{47}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Cube Root**: To find \\(s\\), take the cube root of both sides:\n   \\[\n   s = \\sqrt[3]{-\\frac{50}{47}}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Compute the Decimal Value**: Calculate the cube root of \\(-\\frac{50}{47}\\) using a calculator:\n   - First, compute \\(-\\frac{50}{47} \\approx -1.0638\\).\n   - Then, find the cube root: \\(s \\approx \\sqrt[3]{-1.0638} \\approx -1.0222\\).\n\n5. **Round the Result**: Round the result to four decimal places. Since the fifth decimal place is 2, we round down:\n   \\[\n   s \\approx -1.0222\n   \\]\n\n6. **Check for Additional Solutions**: Since this is a cubic equation, it can have up to three real solutions. However, because the equation is of the form \\(s^3 = \\text{constant}\\), and the constant is negative, there is only one real solution.\n\nTherefore, the final answer, rounded to four decimal places, is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{<<<-1.0222>>>}\n\\]"
