    "To solve the equation \\(26 - 50s^2 = 0\\) for real \\(s\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Rearrange the Equation**: Start by isolating the term with \\(s\\).\n   \\[\n   26 - 50s^2 = 0 \\implies 50s^2 = 26\n   \\]\n\n2. **Solve for \\(s^2\\)**: Divide both sides by 50 to solve for \\(s^2\\).\n   \\[\n   s^2 = \\frac{26}{50} = 0.52\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(s\\)**: Take the square root of both sides to solve for \\(s\\). Remember that taking the square root will yield two solutions, one positive and one negative.\n   \\[\n   s = \\pm \\sqrt{0.52}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Decimal Values**: Compute the square root of 0.52 and round to four decimal places.\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{0.52} \\approx 0.7211\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, the solutions for \\(s\\) are:\n   \\[\n   s = 0.7211 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad s = -0.7211\n   \\]\n\n5. **Format the Answer**: Since there are two solutions, we list them as comma-separated decimal numbers.\n\nThe final answer, rounded to four decimal places, is:\n\\[\n\\text{<<<-0.7211, 0.7211>>>}\n\\]"
