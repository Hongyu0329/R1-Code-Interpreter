    "To solve the equation \\(-85v = 0\\), we need to determine the value(s) of \\(v\\) that satisfy this equation. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Equation**: The equation \\(-85v = 0\\) is a linear equation where the coefficient of \\(v\\) is \\(-85\\).\n\n2. **Isolating the Variable**: To find the value of \\(v\\), we need to isolate it. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by \\(-85\\).\n\n   \\[\n   v = \\frac{0}{-85}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplifying the Equation**: The right side of the equation simplifies to:\n\n   \\[\n   v = 0\n   \\]\n\n4. **Checking the Solution**: Substituting \\(v = 0\\) back into the original equation:\n\n   \\[\n   -85 \\times 0 = 0\n   \\]\n\n   This confirms that the solution is correct.\n\n5. **Formatting the Answer**: According to the instructions, we need to provide the answer as a decimal value rounded to four decimal places. Since the solution is \\(v = 0\\), it is already in decimal form.\n\n6. **Final Answer**: Since there is only one solution, we format it as a single decimal number enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
