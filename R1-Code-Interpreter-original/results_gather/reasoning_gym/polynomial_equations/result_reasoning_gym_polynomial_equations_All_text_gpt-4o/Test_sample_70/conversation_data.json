    "To solve the equation \\(-50e^3 + 55e^2 + 76e = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Factor out the common term**: Notice that each term in the equation has an \\(e\\) in it. We can factor out \\(e\\) from the equation:\n   \\[\n   e(-50e^2 + 55e + 76) = 0\n   \\]\n   This gives us one solution immediately: \\(e = 0\\).\n\n2. **Solve the quadratic equation**: Now, we need to solve the quadratic equation \\(-50e^2 + 55e + 76 = 0\\).\n\n3. **Use the quadratic formula**: The quadratic formula is given by:\n   \\[\n   e = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n   \\]\n   where \\(a = -50\\), \\(b = 55\\), and \\(c = 76\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the discriminant**: The discriminant \\(\\Delta\\) is:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta = b^2 - 4ac = 55^2 - 4(-50)(76)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\Delta = 3025 + 15200 = 18225\n   \\]\n\n5. **Check the discriminant**: Since the discriminant is positive, there are two real solutions.\n\n6. **Calculate the solutions**:\n   \\[\n   e = \\frac{-55 \\pm \\sqrt{18225}}{-100}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{18225} = 135\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   e_1 = \\frac{-55 + 135}{-100} = \\frac{80}{-100} = -0.8\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   e_2 = \\frac{-55 - 135}{-100} = \\frac{-190}{-100} = 1.9\n   \\]\n\n7. **List all solutions**: We have three solutions: \\(e = 0\\), \\(e = -0.8\\), and \\(e = 1.9\\).\n\n8. **Format the answer**: According to the instructions, we need to provide the solutions as comma-separated decimal values rounded to four decimal places.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0.0000, -0.8000, 1.9000>>>"
