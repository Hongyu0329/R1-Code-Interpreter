    "To solve the equation \\(76y^2 = 0\\), we need to determine the real value(s) of \\(y\\) that satisfy this equation. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation given is \\(76y^2 = 0\\). This is a quadratic equation in the form of \\(ay^2 = 0\\), where \\(a = 76\\).\n\n2. **Simplify the Equation**: Since the equation is \\(76y^2 = 0\\), we can divide both sides by 76 to simplify it. This gives us:\n   \\[\n   y^2 = 0\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(y\\)**: The equation \\(y^2 = 0\\) implies that \\(y\\) must be a number whose square is zero. The only real number that satisfies this condition is:\n   \\[\n   y = 0\n   \\]\n\n4. **Check for Additional Solutions**: Since \\(y^2 = 0\\) is a simple quadratic equation, it has at most two solutions. However, in this case, both solutions are the same, \\(y = 0\\).\n\n5. **Format the Answer**: According to the instructions, if there is one solution, we should provide a single decimal number. The solution \\(y = 0\\) is already in decimal form.\n\n6. **Round the Solution**: The solution \\(y = 0\\) is already a whole number, so no rounding is necessary.\n\n7. **Final Answer**: Enclose the answer within triple angle brackets as specified.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0>>>"
