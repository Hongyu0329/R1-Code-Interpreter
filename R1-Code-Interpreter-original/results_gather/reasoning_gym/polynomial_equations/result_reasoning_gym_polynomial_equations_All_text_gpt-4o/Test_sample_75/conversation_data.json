    "To solve the equation \\(19h^3 + 5h^2 = 0\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Factor the equation**: \n   The given equation is \\(19h^3 + 5h^2 = 0\\). We can factor out the common term \\(h^2\\):\n   \\[\n   h^2(19h + 5) = 0\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set each factor to zero**:\n   - The first factor is \\(h^2 = 0\\). Solving this gives:\n     \\[\n     h = 0\n     \\]\n   - The second factor is \\(19h + 5 = 0\\). Solving for \\(h\\) gives:\n     \\[\n     19h = -5 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad h = -\\frac{5}{19}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Convert the exact form to decimal**:\n   - The solution \\(h = -\\frac{5}{19}\\) can be converted to a decimal:\n     \\[\n     h = -0.2631578947 \\ldots\n     \\]\n   - Rounding to four decimal places, we get:\n     \\[\n     h = -0.2631\n     \\]\n\n4. **List all solutions**:\n   We have two solutions: \\(h = 0\\) and \\(h = -0.2631\\).\n\n5. **Format the answer**:\n   Since there are two solutions, we list them as comma-separated decimal numbers.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[ \n\\text{<<<0, -0.2631>>>}\n\\]"
