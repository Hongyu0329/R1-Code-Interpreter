    "To solve the equation \\(13y^3 + 38y^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Factor the equation**: \n   The given equation is \\(13y^3 + 38y^2 = 0\\). We can factor out the common term \\(y^2\\):\n   \\[\n   y^2(13y + 38) = 0\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set each factor to zero**:\n   - The first factor is \\(y^2 = 0\\). Solving this gives:\n     \\[\n     y = 0\n     \\]\n   - The second factor is \\(13y + 38 = 0\\). Solving for \\(y\\) gives:\n     \\[\n     13y = -38 \\\\\n     y = -\\frac{38}{13}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Convert the fraction to a decimal**:\n   - Calculate \\(-\\frac{38}{13}\\):\n     \\[\n     y = -2.923076923 \\ldots\n     \\]\n   - Round this to four decimal places:\n     \\[\n     y = -2.9230\n     \\]\n\n4. **List all solutions**:\n   We have two solutions: \\(y = 0\\) and \\(y = -2.9230\\).\n\n5. **Format the answer**:\n   Since there are two solutions, we list them as comma-separated decimal numbers.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\text{<<<}0.0000, -2.9230\\text{>>>}\n\\]"
