    "To solve the equation \\(86h^3 + 81h^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Factor the equation**: \n   The given equation is \\(86h^3 + 81h^2 = 0\\). We can factor out the common term \\(h^2\\):\n   \\[\n   h^2(86h + 81) = 0\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set each factor to zero**:\n   We have two factors: \\(h^2\\) and \\(86h + 81\\). We set each factor equal to zero to find the solutions.\n\n   - For \\(h^2 = 0\\):\n     \\[\n     h = 0\n     \\]\n     This gives us one solution: \\(h = 0\\).\n\n   - For \\(86h + 81 = 0\\):\n     \\[\n     86h = -81\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     h = -\\frac{81}{86}\n     \\]\n     Calculate the decimal value:\n     \\[\n     h \\approx -0.9418604651\n     \\]\n     Rounding to four decimal places, we get:\n     \\[\n     h \\approx -0.9418\n     \\]\n\n3. **List all solutions**:\n   We have found two solutions: \\(h = 0\\) and \\(h \\approx -0.9418\\).\n\n4. **Format the answer**:\n   Since there are two solutions, we list them as comma-separated decimal numbers.\n\nThe final answer, rounded to four decimal places, is:\n\\[\n\\text{<<<}0.0000, -0.9418\\text{>>>}\n\\]"
