    "To solve the equation \\(-9c^3 - 142c^2 - 27c = 0\\), we can start by factoring out the common term \\(c\\):\n\n1. **Factor out \\(c\\):**\n   \\[\n   c(-9c^2 - 142c - 27) = 0\n   \\]\n\n2. **Identify the solutions:**\n   - The first solution is \\(c = 0\\).\n\n3. **Solve the quadratic equation:**\n   - We need to solve the quadratic equation \\(-9c^2 - 142c - 27 = 0\\).\n   - Use the quadratic formula: \\(c = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\), where \\(a = -9\\), \\(b = -142\\), and \\(c = -27\\).\n\n4. **Calculate the discriminant:**\n   \\[\n   b^2 - 4ac = (-142)^2 - 4(-9)(-27) = 20164 - 972 = 19192\n   \\]\n\n5. **Check the discriminant:**\n   - Since the discriminant is positive, there are two real solutions.\n\n6. **Calculate the roots using the quadratic formula:**\n   \\[\n   c = \\frac{-(-142) \\pm \\sqrt{19192}}{2(-9)}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   c = \\frac{142 \\pm \\sqrt{19192}}{-18}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Calculate \\(\\sqrt{19192}\\):**\n   - \\(\\sqrt{19192} \\approx 138.4996\\)\n\n8. **Find the two solutions:**\n   - First solution:\n     \\[\n     c_1 = \\frac{142 + 138.4996}{-18} \\approx \\frac{280.4996}{-18} \\approx -15.5833\n     \\]\n   - Second solution:\n     \\[\n     c_2 = \\frac{142 - 138.4996}{-18} \\approx \\frac{3.5004}{-18} \\approx -0.1944\n     \\]\n\n9. **List all solutions:**\n   - The solutions are \\(c = 0\\), \\(c \\approx -15.5833\\), and \\(c \\approx -0.1944\\).\n\n10. **Format the final answer:**\n    - The solutions are \\(0\\), \\(-15.5833\\), and \\(-0.1944\\).\n\nThe final answer is: <<<0, -15.5833, -0.1944>>>."
