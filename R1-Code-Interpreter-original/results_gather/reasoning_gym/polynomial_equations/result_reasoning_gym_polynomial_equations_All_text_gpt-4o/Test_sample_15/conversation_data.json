    "To solve the equation \\(138 \\cdot n = 0\\), we need to find the value(s) of \\(n\\) that satisfy this equation. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation given is \\(138 \\cdot n = 0\\). This is a simple linear equation where we are multiplying 138 by \\(n\\).\n\n2. **Isolate \\(n\\)**: To find the value of \\(n\\), we need to isolate it. Since 138 is a non-zero number, the only way for the product of 138 and \\(n\\) to be zero is if \\(n\\) itself is zero. This is based on the property of multiplication that states if the product of two numbers is zero, then at least one of the numbers must be zero.\n\n3. **Solution**: Therefore, the solution to the equation is \\(n = 0\\).\n\n4. **Format the Answer**: According to the instructions, we need to provide the answer as a decimal value, rounded to four decimal places. Since the solution is \\(n = 0\\), it is already in decimal form and does not require rounding.\n\n5. **Output the Answer**: Since there is only one solution, we format it as a single decimal number within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
