    "To solve the polynomial equation \\(-30u - 28 = 0\\) for real \\(u\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the type of equation**: The given equation is a linear equation in the form \\(ax + b = 0\\), where \\(a = -30\\) and \\(b = -28\\).\n\n2. **Rearrange the equation**: We need to isolate \\(u\\) on one side of the equation. Start by adding 28 to both sides:\n   \\[\n   -30u = 28\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(u\\)**: Divide both sides by \\(-30\\) to solve for \\(u\\):\n   \\[\n   u = \\frac{28}{-30}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the fraction**: Simplify \\(\\frac{28}{-30}\\) to its decimal form:\n   \\[\n   u = -\\frac{28}{30} = -\\frac{14}{15}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Convert to decimal**: Calculate the decimal value of \\(-\\frac{14}{15}\\):\n   \\[\n   u \\approx -0.9333\n   \\]\n\n6. **Round the decimal**: Round the decimal to four decimal places. Since the fifth decimal place is 3, we round down:\n   \\[\n   u = -0.9333\n   \\]\n\n7. **Format the answer**: Since there is only one solution, we provide the answer as a single decimal number.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{<<<-0.9333>>>}\n\\]"
