    "To solve the equation \\(31u - 45 = 0\\), we need to find the value of \\(u\\) that makes the equation true. Let's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the equation**: The given equation is \\(31u - 45 = 0\\).\n\n2. **Isolate the variable \\(u\\)**: To solve for \\(u\\), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by adding 45 to both sides of the equation:\n   \\[\n   31u = 45\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(u\\)**: Now, divide both sides of the equation by 31 to solve for \\(u\\):\n   \\[\n   u = \\frac{45}{31}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Convert to decimal form**: Calculate the decimal value of \\(\\frac{45}{31}\\):\n   \\[\n   u \\approx 1.4516129032\n   \\]\n\n5. **Round the decimal value**: According to the instructions, we need to round the decimal value to four decimal places. The fifth decimal place is 6, so we round up:\n   \\[\n   u \\approx 1.4516\n   \\]\n\n6. **Format the answer**: Since there is only one solution, we provide the answer as a single decimal number.\n\nThe final answer, formatted as instructed, is:\n\n<<<1.4516>>>"
