    "To solve the polynomial equation for real \\( o \\):\n\n1. Start with the given equation:\n   \\[\n   100 - 112o = 0\n   \\]\n\n2. Rearrange the equation to isolate \\( o \\):\n   \\[\n   112o = 100\n   \\]\n\n3. Solve for \\( o \\) by dividing both sides by 112:\n   \\[\n   o = \\frac{100}{112}\n   \\]\n\n4. Simplify the fraction:\n   \\[\n   o = \\frac{25}{28}\n   \\]\n\n5. Convert the fraction to a decimal:\n   \\[\n   o \\approx 0.892857\n   \\]\n\n6. Round the decimal to four decimal places:\n   \\[\n   o = 0.8928\n   \\]\n\nSince there is only one solution, format the answer as a single decimal number within triple angle brackets.\n\nFinal answer:\n<<<0.8928>>>"
