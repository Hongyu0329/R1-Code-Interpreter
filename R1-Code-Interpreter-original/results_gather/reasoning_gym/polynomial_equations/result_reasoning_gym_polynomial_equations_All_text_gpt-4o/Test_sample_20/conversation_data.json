    "To solve the equation \\(34 \\cdot k = 0\\), we need to find the value(s) of \\(k\\) that satisfy this equation. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation given is \\(34 \\cdot k = 0\\). This is a simple linear equation where \\(34\\) is multiplied by \\(k\\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Variable**: To find the value of \\(k\\), we need to isolate it. Since \\(34\\) is multiplied by \\(k\\), we can divide both sides of the equation by \\(34\\) to solve for \\(k\\).\n\n3. **Perform the Division**: \n   \\[\n   k = \\frac{0}{34}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the Expression**: \n   \\[\n   k = 0\n   \\]\n\n5. **Check the Solution**: Substitute \\(k = 0\\) back into the original equation to verify:\n   \\[\n   34 \\cdot 0 = 0\n   \\]\n   The equation holds true, confirming that \\(k = 0\\) is indeed a solution.\n\n6. **Determine the Number of Solutions**: Since the equation is linear and we have found one solution, there is exactly one real value for \\(k\\).\n\n7. **Format the Answer**: According to the instructions, for one solution, we provide a single decimal number. The solution \\(k = 0\\) is already in decimal form.\n\n8. **Round the Solution**: The solution \\(0\\) does not require rounding as it is already a whole number.\n\n9. **Enclose the Answer**: Finally, we enclose the answer within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0>>>"
