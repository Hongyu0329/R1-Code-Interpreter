    "To solve the polynomial equation for real \\( g \\):\n\n1. **Identify the equation**: The given equation is \\( 34 - 154g = 0 \\).\n\n2. **Rearrange the equation**: To isolate \\( g \\), we need to move all terms involving \\( g \\) to one side of the equation. This can be done by adding \\( 154g \\) to both sides:\n\n   \\[\n   34 = 154g\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( g \\)**: Divide both sides by 154 to solve for \\( g \\):\n\n   \\[\n   g = \\frac{34}{154}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the fraction**: Simplify the fraction if possible. The greatest common divisor of 34 and 154 is 2, so:\n\n   \\[\n   g = \\frac{34 \\div 2}{154 \\div 2} = \\frac{17}{77}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Convert to decimal form**: Calculate the decimal value of \\( \\frac{17}{77} \\):\n\n   \\[\n   g \\approx 0.2207792207792208\n   \\]\n\n6. **Round the decimal**: Round the decimal to four decimal places:\n\n   \\[\n   g \\approx 0.2207\n   \\]\n\n7. **Format the answer**: Since there is only one solution, format the answer as a single decimal number within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<0.2207>>>"
