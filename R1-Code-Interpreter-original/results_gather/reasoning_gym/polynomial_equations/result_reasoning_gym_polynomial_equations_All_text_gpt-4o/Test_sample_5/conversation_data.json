    "To solve the equation \\(81x^3 + 57 = 0\\), we need to find the real value(s) of \\(x\\).\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Isolate the \\(x^3\\) term:**\n   \\[\n   81x^3 = -57\n   \\]\n\n2. **Solve for \\(x^3\\):**\n   \\[\n   x^3 = \\frac{-57}{81}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the fraction:**\n   \\[\n   x^3 = -\\frac{19}{27}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Find the cube root of both sides:**\n   \\[\n   x = \\sqrt[3]{-\\frac{19}{27}}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the cube root:**\n   - The cube root of a negative number is negative.\n   - Calculate the cube root of \\(\\frac{19}{27}\\).\n\n6. **Convert to decimal form:**\n   - \\(\\sqrt[3]{19} \\approx 2.6684\\)\n   - \\(\\sqrt[3]{27} = 3\\)\n   - Therefore, \\(\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{19}{27}} \\approx \\frac{2.6684}{3} \\approx 0.8895\\)\n\n7. **Apply the negative sign:**\n   \\[\n   x \\approx -0.8895\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe real value of \\(x\\) that satisfies the equation is approximately \\(-0.8895\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-0.8895>>>"
