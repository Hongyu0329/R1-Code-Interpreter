    "To solve the polynomial equation \\(79h + 10 = 0\\) for real \\(h\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the type of equation**: This is a linear equation in the form \\(ax + b = 0\\), where \\(a = 79\\) and \\(b = 10\\).\n\n2. **Rearrange the equation**: We need to isolate \\(h\\) on one side of the equation. To do this, subtract 10 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   79h = -10\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(h\\)**: Divide both sides by 79 to solve for \\(h\\):\n   \\[\n   h = \\frac{-10}{79}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Convert to decimal form**: Calculate the decimal value of \\(\\frac{-10}{79}\\):\n   \\[\n   h \\approx -0.12658227848101267\n   \\]\n\n5. **Round the decimal value**: According to the instructions, round the decimal to four decimal places. Since the fifth decimal place is 8, which is greater than 5, we round down:\n   \\[\n   h \\approx -0.1265\n   \\]\n\n6. **Format the answer**: Since there is only one solution, we provide the answer as a single decimal number.\n\nThe final answer, formatted as instructed, is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{<<<-0.1265>>>}\n\\]"
