    "To solve the equation \\(-54n^3 - 61n^2 = 0\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Factor the equation**: \n   The given equation is \\(-54n^3 - 61n^2 = 0\\). We can factor out the common term, which is \\(n^2\\):\n   \\[\n   n^2(-54n - 61) = 0\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set each factor to zero**:\n   We have two factors: \\(n^2\\) and \\(-54n - 61\\). We set each factor equal to zero to find the solutions.\n\n   - For \\(n^2 = 0\\):\n     \\[\n     n = 0\n     \\]\n     This gives us one solution: \\(n = 0\\).\n\n   - For \\(-54n - 61 = 0\\):\n     \\[\n     -54n = 61\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     n = -\\frac{61}{54}\n     \\]\n     Calculate the decimal value:\n     \\[\n     n \\approx -1.1296\n     \\]\n\n3. **List the solutions**:\n   We have found two solutions: \\(n = 0\\) and \\(n \\approx -1.1296\\).\n\n4. **Format the answer**:\n   We have two solutions, so we will list them as comma-separated decimal values, rounded to four decimal places.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n<<<0.0000, -1.1296>>>\n\\]"
