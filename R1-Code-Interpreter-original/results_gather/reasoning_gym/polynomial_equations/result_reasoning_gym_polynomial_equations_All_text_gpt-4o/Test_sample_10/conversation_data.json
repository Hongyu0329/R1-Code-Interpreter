    "To solve the equation \\(-127w = 0\\), we need to find the value(s) of \\(w\\) that satisfy this equation. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation given is \\(-127w = 0\\). This is a linear equation in one variable, \\(w\\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Variable**: To find the value of \\(w\\), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by \\(-127\\).\n\n3. **Perform the Division**: \n   \\[\n   w = \\frac{0}{-127}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the Expression**: \n   \\[\n   w = 0\n   \\]\n\n5. **Check the Solution**: Substitute \\(w = 0\\) back into the original equation to verify:\n   \\[\n   -127 \\times 0 = 0\n   \\]\n   The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming that \\(w = 0\\) is indeed a solution.\n\n6. **Determine the Number of Solutions**: Since the equation is linear and we have found one solution, there is exactly one real solution.\n\n7. **Format the Answer**: According to the instructions, for one solution, we provide a single decimal number. The solution \\(w = 0\\) is already in decimal form.\n\n8. **Round the Solution**: The solution \\(0\\) does not require rounding as it is already a whole number.\n\n9. **Enclose the Answer**: Finally, we enclose the answer within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0>>>"
