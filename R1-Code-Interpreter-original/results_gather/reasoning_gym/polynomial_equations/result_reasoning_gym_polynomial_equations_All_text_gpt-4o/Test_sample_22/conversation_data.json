    "To solve the equation \\(-49e^2 + 119e = 0\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the type of equation**: This is a quadratic equation in the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), where \\(a = -49\\), \\(b = 119\\), and \\(c = 0\\).\n\n2. **Factor the equation**: Since the equation is quadratic and \\(c = 0\\), we can factor out the common term \\(e\\):\n   \\[\n   e(-49e + 119) = 0\n   \\]\n\n3. **Set each factor to zero**: This gives us two separate equations to solve:\n   \\[\n   e = 0\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   -49e + 119 = 0\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve each equation**:\n   - For \\(e = 0\\), the solution is simply \\(e = 0\\).\n   - For \\(-49e + 119 = 0\\), solve for \\(e\\):\n     \\[\n     -49e = -119\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     e = \\frac{119}{49}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     e = \\frac{119}{49} = 2.4285714285714284\n     \\]\n\n5. **Round the solutions**: Round the decimal value to four decimal places:\n   - \\(e = 0\\) remains \\(0.0000\\)\n   - \\(e = 2.4285714285714284\\) rounds to \\(2.4285\\)\n\n6. **Format the final answer**: Since there are two solutions, we list them as comma-separated decimal values.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0.0000, 2.4285>>>"
