    "To solve the equation \\(50o^2 - 89 = 0\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Rearrange the Equation**: Start by isolating the term with the variable.\n   \\[\n   50o^2 = 89\n   \\]\n\n2. **Solve for \\(o^2\\)**: Divide both sides by 50 to solve for \\(o^2\\).\n   \\[\n   o^2 = \\frac{89}{50}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Square Root**: Take the square root of both sides to solve for \\(o\\).\n   \\[\n   o = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{89}{50}}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate Decimal Values**: Compute the decimal values for the positive and negative roots.\n   - First, calculate \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{89}{50}}\\).\n   - \\(\\frac{89}{50} = 1.78\\).\n   - \\(\\sqrt{1.78} \\approx 1.3345\\).\n\n5. **Determine the Solutions**: The solutions for \\(o\\) are:\n   - \\(o = 1.3345\\)\n   - \\(o = -1.3345\\)\n\n6. **Format the Answer**: Since there are two solutions, we list them as comma-separated decimal values.\n\nThe final answer, rounded to four decimal places, is:\n\n<<<-1.3345, 1.3345>>>"
