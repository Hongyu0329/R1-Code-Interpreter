    "To solve the equation \\(78 - 69w^2 = 0\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Rearrange the Equation**: Start by isolating the term with \\(w\\).\n   \\[\n   78 - 69w^2 = 0 \\implies 69w^2 = 78\n   \\]\n\n2. **Solve for \\(w^2\\)**: Divide both sides by 69 to solve for \\(w^2\\).\n   \\[\n   w^2 = \\frac{78}{69}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the Fraction**: Simplify \\(\\frac{78}{69}\\).\n   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 78 and 69 is 3.\n   - Simplifying gives:\n     \\[\n     w^2 = \\frac{78 \\div 3}{69 \\div 3} = \\frac{26}{23}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\(w\\)**: Take the square root of both sides to solve for \\(w\\).\n   \\[\n   w = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{26}{23}}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Convert to Decimal Form**: Calculate the decimal values of \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{26}{23}}\\).\n   - First, calculate \\(\\frac{26}{23} \\approx 1.1304\\).\n   - Then, calculate the square root: \\(\\sqrt{1.1304} \\approx 1.0632\\).\n\n6. **Determine the Solutions**: Since \\(w\\) can be both positive and negative, the solutions are:\n   \\[\n   w = 1.0632 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad w = -1.0632\n   \\]\n\n7. **Format the Answer**: According to the instructions, we have two solutions, so we list them as comma-separated decimal values.\n\nThe final answer, rounded to four decimal places, is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{<<<-1.0632, 1.0632>>>}\n\\]"
