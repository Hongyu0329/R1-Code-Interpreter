    "To solve the equation \\(36e^3 + 83 = 0\\), we need to find the real value(s) of \\(e\\) that satisfy this equation. Let's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Rearrange the Equation**: \n   \\[\n   36e^3 + 83 = 0 \\implies 36e^3 = -83\n   \\]\n\n2. **Isolate \\(e^3\\)**:\n   \\[\n   e^3 = -\\frac{83}{36}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(e\\)**:\n   To find \\(e\\), we need to take the cube root of both sides:\n   \\[\n   e = \\sqrt[3]{-\\frac{83}{36}}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Cube Root**:\n   - First, calculate \\(-\\frac{83}{36}\\):\n     \\[\n     -\\frac{83}{36} \\approx -2.3056\n     \\]\n   - Now, find the cube root of \\(-2.3056\\):\n     \\[\n     e \\approx \\sqrt[3]{-2.3056} \\approx -1.3211\n     \\]\n\n5. **Check for Additional Solutions**:\n   Since this is a cubic equation and we are looking for real solutions, we need to consider if there are any other real roots. However, the equation \\(36e^3 + 83 = 0\\) is a simple cubic equation with only one real root because the discriminant of a cubic equation with no quadratic or linear terms (like this one) indicates only one real root.\n\n6. **Final Answer**:\n   We have determined that there is only one real solution for \\(e\\), which is approximately \\(-1.3211\\).\n\nTherefore, the real value of \\(e\\) that satisfies the equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{<<<-1.3211>>>}\n\\]"
