    "To solve the equation \\(-36t = 0\\), we need to determine the value(s) of \\(t\\) that satisfy this equation. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the equation**: The given equation is \\(-36t = 0\\).\n\n2. **Isolate the variable**: To find the value of \\(t\\), we need to isolate it. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by \\(-36\\).\n\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{0}{-36}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the equation**: The right side of the equation simplifies to 0 because any number divided by a non-zero number is 0.\n\n   \\[\n   t = 0\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the number of solutions**: The equation \\(-36t = 0\\) is a linear equation, and it has exactly one solution, which is \\(t = 0\\).\n\n5. **Format the answer**: According to the instructions, for a single solution, we should provide the answer as a single decimal number. Since \\(t = 0\\) is already in decimal form, we can directly use it.\n\n6. **Round the solution**: The solution \\(t = 0\\) does not require rounding as it is already a simple decimal number.\n\n7. **Enclose the answer**: Finally, we enclose the answer within triple angle brackets as specified.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
