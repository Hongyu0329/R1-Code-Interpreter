    "To solve the equation \\(9 - 125c = 0\\) for the real value of \\(c\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Isolate the variable \\(c\\):**\n   - Start with the equation: \\(9 - 125c = 0\\).\n   - To isolate \\(c\\), we need to move the constant term (9) to the other side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 9 from both sides:\n     \\[\n     -125c = -9\n     \\]\n\n2. **Solve for \\(c\\):**\n   - Now, divide both sides of the equation by \\(-125\\) to solve for \\(c\\):\n     \\[\n     c = \\frac{-9}{-125}\n     \\]\n   - Simplify the fraction:\n     \\[\n     c = \\frac{9}{125}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Convert the fraction to a decimal:**\n   - Calculate the decimal value of \\(\\frac{9}{125}\\):\n     \\[\n     c = 0.072\n     \\]\n\n4. **Round the decimal value:**\n   - The decimal value \\(0.072\\) is already rounded to four decimal places.\n\n5. **Format the answer:**\n   - Since there is only one solution, we provide the answer as a single decimal number.\n\nThe final answer, formatted according to the instructions, is:\n\n<<<0.072>>>"
