    "To solve the equation \\(25k^2 - 15 = 0\\) for real \\(k\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Rearrange the Equation**: Start by isolating the term with \\(k\\).\n   \\[\n   25k^2 = 15\n   \\]\n\n2. **Solve for \\(k^2\\)**: Divide both sides by 25 to solve for \\(k^2\\).\n   \\[\n   k^2 = \\frac{15}{25} = \\frac{3}{5}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Take the Square Root**: Solve for \\(k\\) by taking the square root of both sides. Remember that taking the square root introduces both positive and negative solutions.\n   \\[\n   k = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{5}}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Convert to Decimal Form**: Calculate the decimal values of \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{5}}\\).\n   - First, calculate \\(\\frac{3}{5} = 0.6\\).\n   - Then, find \\(\\sqrt{0.6}\\).\n\n5. **Calculate and Round**: Use a calculator to find \\(\\sqrt{0.6}\\) and round to four decimal places.\n   - \\(\\sqrt{0.6} \\approx 0.7745966692\\)\n   - Rounded to four decimal places, this is \\(0.7745\\).\n\n6. **List the Solutions**: Since we have two solutions, \\(k = 0.7745\\) and \\(k = -0.7745\\).\n\n7. **Format the Answer**: According to the instructions, list the solutions as comma-separated decimal values.\n\nThe final answer, formatted as required, is:\n\n<<<-0.7745, 0.7745>>>"
