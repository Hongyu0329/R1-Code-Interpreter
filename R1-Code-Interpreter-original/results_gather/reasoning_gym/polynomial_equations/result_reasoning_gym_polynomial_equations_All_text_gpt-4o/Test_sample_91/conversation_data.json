    "To solve the equation \\(-35b^2 - 5b = 0\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Factor the equation**: \n   The given equation is \\(-35b^2 - 5b = 0\\). We can factor out the common term, which is \\(-5b\\):\n   \\[\n   -5b(7b + 1) = 0\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set each factor to zero**:\n   For the product of two terms to be zero, at least one of the terms must be zero. Therefore, we set each factor equal to zero:\n   \\[\n   -5b = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 7b + 1 = 0\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve each equation**:\n   - For \\(-5b = 0\\):\n     \\[\n     b = 0\n     \\]\n   - For \\(7b + 1 = 0\\):\n     \\[\n     7b = -1 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad b = -\\frac{1}{7}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Convert solutions to decimal form**:\n   - \\(b = 0\\) is already in decimal form.\n   - \\(b = -\\frac{1}{7}\\) converts to a decimal as:\n     \\[\n     b = -0.142857 \\ldots\n     \\]\n     Rounding to four decimal places, we get:\n     \\[\n     b = -0.1428\n     \\]\n\n5. **List the solutions**:\n   We have two solutions: \\(b = 0\\) and \\(b = -0.1428\\).\n\n6. **Format the answer**:\n   According to the instructions, we should list the solutions as comma-separated decimal values and enclose them within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0, -0.1428>>>"
