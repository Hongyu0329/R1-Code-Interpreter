    "To solve the quadratic equation \\(86b^2 - 2b - 13 = 0\\), we will use the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[ b = \\frac{-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A} \\]\n\nwhere \\(A = 86\\), \\(B = -2\\), and \\(C = -13\\).\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the discriminant**\n\nThe discriminant \\(\\Delta\\) is given by:\n\n\\[ \\Delta = B^2 - 4AC \\]\n\nSubstitute the values:\n\n\\[ \\Delta = (-2)^2 - 4 \\times 86 \\times (-13) \\]\n\\[ \\Delta = 4 + 4464 \\]\n\\[ \\Delta = 4468 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real solutions.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the solutions using the quadratic formula**\n\nThe solutions are:\n\n\\[ b = \\frac{-(-2) \\pm \\sqrt{4468}}{2 \\times 86} \\]\n\\[ b = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{4468}}{172} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the square root of the discriminant**\n\nCalculate \\(\\sqrt{4468}\\):\n\n\\[ \\sqrt{4468} \\approx 66.8552 \\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the two solutions**\n\n1.
