    "To solve the equation \\(125 \\cdot g^3 = 0\\), we need to find the real value(s) of \\(g\\) that satisfy this equation. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation given is \\(125 \\cdot g^3 = 0\\). This is a cubic equation in terms of \\(g\\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Cubic Term**: Divide both sides of the equation by 125 to simplify:\n   \\[\n   g^3 = 0\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(g\\)**: The equation \\(g^3 = 0\\) implies that \\(g\\) must be a number whose cube is zero. The only real number that satisfies this condition is:\n   \\[\n   g = 0\n   \\]\n\n4. **Check for Additional Solutions**: Since this is a cubic equation, it could potentially have up to three real solutions. However, the equation \\(g^3 = 0\\) only has one real solution, which is \\(g = 0\\).\n\n5. **Format the Answer**: According to the instructions, for one solution, we provide a single decimal number. The solution \\(g = 0\\) is already in decimal form.\n\n6. **Round the Solution**: The solution \\(g = 0\\) is already a whole number, so no rounding is necessary.\n\n7. **Final Answer**: Enclose the answer within triple angle brackets as specified.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0>>>"
