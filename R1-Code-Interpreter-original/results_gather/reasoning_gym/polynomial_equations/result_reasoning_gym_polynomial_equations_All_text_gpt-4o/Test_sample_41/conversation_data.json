    "To solve the polynomial equation \\(-39k - 65 = 0\\) for real \\(k\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Isolate the variable \\(k\\):**\n   - Start with the equation: \\(-39k - 65 = 0\\).\n   - Add 65 to both sides to isolate the term with \\(k\\): \\(-39k = 65\\).\n\n2. **Solve for \\(k\\):**\n   - Divide both sides by \\(-39\\) to solve for \\(k\\):\n     \\[\n     k = \\frac{65}{-39}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the decimal value:**\n   - Perform the division: \\(k = \\frac{65}{-39} \\approx -1.666666...\\).\n\n4. **Round the result:**\n   - Round the decimal value to four decimal places. Since the fifth decimal place is 6, we round down:\n     \\[\n     k \\approx -1.6666\n     \\]\n\n5. **Format the answer:**\n   - Since there is only one solution, we provide a single decimal number.\n\nThe final answer, rounded to four decimal places, is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{<<<-1.6666>>>}\n\\]"
