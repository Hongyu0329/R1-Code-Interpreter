    "To solve the quadratic equation \\(44n^2 + 90n - 63 = 0\\), we will use the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nwhere \\(a = 44\\), \\(b = 90\\), and \\(c = -63\\).\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the discriminant (\\(b^2 - 4ac\\))**\n\n\\[ b^2 = 90^2 = 8100 \\]\n\n\\[ 4ac = 4 \\times 44 \\times (-63) = -11088 \\]\n\n\\[ b^2 - 4ac = 8100 - (-11088) = 8100 + 11088 = 19188 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Check the discriminant**\n\nSince the discriminant is positive (\\(19188 > 0\\)), there are two distinct real solutions.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the solutions using the quadratic formula**\n\n\\[ n = \\frac{-90 \\pm \\sqrt{19188}}{2 \\times 44} \\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate \\(\\sqrt{19188}\\)**\n\nUsing a calculator, \\(\\sqrt{19188} \\approx 138.4722\\).\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the two solutions**\n\n1. First solution:\n\n\\[ n_1 = \\frac{-90 + 138.4722}{88} \\]\n\n\\[ n_1 = \\frac{48.4722}{88} \\]\n\n\\[ n_1 \\approx 0.5508 \\]\n\n2.
