    "To solve the equation \\(-k^2 + 148k = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Rearrange the Equation**: The given equation is \\(-k^2 + 148k = 0\\). We can factor out a common term from the equation. \n\n2. **Factor the Equation**: \n   \\[\n   -k^2 + 148k = 0 \\implies k(-k + 148) = 0\n   \\]\n   This equation is now factored into two parts: \\(k\\) and \\(-k + 148\\).\n\n3. **Solve for k**: \n   - For the first factor \\(k = 0\\), we have one solution: \\(k = 0\\).\n   - For the second factor \\(-k + 148 = 0\\), solve for \\(k\\):\n     \\[\n     -k + 148 = 0 \\implies k = 148\n     \\]\n\n4. **List the Solutions**: The solutions to the equation are \\(k = 0\\) and \\(k = 148\\).\n\n5. **Convert to Decimal Form**: Both solutions are already in decimal form.\n\n6. **Format the Answer**: Since there are two solutions, we list them as comma-separated decimal numbers.\n\n7. **Round the Solutions**: Both solutions are integers, so no rounding is necessary.\n\nThe final answer, formatted as specified, is:\n\n<<<0.0000, 148.0000>>>"
