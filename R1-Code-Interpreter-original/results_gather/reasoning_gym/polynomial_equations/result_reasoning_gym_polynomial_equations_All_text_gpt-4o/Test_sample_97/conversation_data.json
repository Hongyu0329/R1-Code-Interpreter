    "To solve the equation \\(-152u^3 - 30 = 0\\), we need to find the real value(s) of \\(u\\) that satisfy this equation. Let's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Rearrange the Equation:**\n   \\[\n   -152u^3 - 30 = 0\n   \\]\n   Add 30 to both sides:\n   \\[\n   -152u^3 = 30\n   \\]\n   Divide both sides by -152:\n   \\[\n   u^3 = -\\frac{30}{152}\n   \\]\n   Simplify the fraction:\n   \\[\n   u^3 = -\\frac{15}{76}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Solve for \\(u\\):**\n   To find \\(u\\), take the cube root of both sides:\n   \\[\n   u = \\sqrt[3]{-\\frac{15}{76}}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Decimal Value:**\n   Compute the cube root of \\(-\\frac{15}{76}\\):\n   \\[\n   u \\approx \\sqrt[3]{-0.1973684211}\n   \\]\n   Using a calculator, we find:\n   \\[\n   u \\approx -0.5830\n   \\]\n\n4. **Check for Additional Solutions:**\n   Since this is a cubic equation, it can have up to three real roots. However, because the equation is a simple monomial \\(u^3\\), it only has one real root. The other two roots, if they exist, would be complex and not real.\n\n5. **Format the Answer:**\n   Since there is only one real solution, we format the answer as a single decimal number.\n\nThe final answer, rounded to four decimal places, is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{<<<-0.5830>>>}\n\\]"
