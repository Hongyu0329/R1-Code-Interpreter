    "To solve the equation \\(77y = 0\\), we need to find the value(s) of \\(y\\) that satisfy this equation. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation given is \\(77y = 0\\). This is a linear equation in one variable, \\(y\\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Variable**: To find the value of \\(y\\), we need to isolate it. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 77, assuming 77 is not zero (which it isn't).\n\n   \\[\n   y = \\frac{0}{77}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the Expression**: The right-hand side simplifies to:\n\n   \\[\n   y = 0\n   \\]\n\n4. **Check the Solution**: Substitute \\(y = 0\\) back into the original equation to verify:\n\n   \\[\n   77 \\times 0 = 0\n   \\]\n\n   The equation holds true, confirming that \\(y = 0\\) is indeed a solution.\n\n5. **Determine the Number of Solutions**: Since this is a linear equation and we have found one solution, there is exactly one real solution.\n\n6. **Format the Answer**: According to the instructions, for one solution, we provide a single decimal number. The solution is already in decimal form and does not require further conversion or rounding.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
