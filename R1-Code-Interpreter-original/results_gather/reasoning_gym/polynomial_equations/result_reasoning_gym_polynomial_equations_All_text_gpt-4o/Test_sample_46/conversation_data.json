    "To solve the polynomial equation \\(-164g = 0\\) for real \\(g\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Type of Equation**: The given equation is a linear equation in the form of \\(ax = 0\\), where \\(a = -164\\) and \\(x = g\\).\n\n2. **Solve the Equation**: \n   - Since the equation is linear, we can solve for \\(g\\) by isolating it on one side of the equation.\n   - Divide both sides of the equation by \\(-164\\) to solve for \\(g\\):\n     \\[\n     g = \\frac{0}{-164} = 0\n     \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Number of Solutions**: \n   - A linear equation of the form \\(ax = 0\\) always has exactly one solution when \\(a \\neq 0\\).\n   - In this case, since \\(-164 \\neq 0\\), there is exactly one solution.\n\n4. **Format the Solution**: \n   - According to the instructions, for one solution, we provide a single decimal number.\n   - The solution \\(g = 0\\) is already in decimal form.\n\n5. **Round the Solution**: \n   - The solution \\(0\\) does not require rounding as it is already a whole number.\n\n6. **Output the Solution**: \n   - Enclose the solution within triple angle brackets as specified.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
