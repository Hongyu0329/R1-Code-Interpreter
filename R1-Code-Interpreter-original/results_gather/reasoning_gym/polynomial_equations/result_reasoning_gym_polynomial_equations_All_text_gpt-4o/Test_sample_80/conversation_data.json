    "To solve the polynomial equation \\(115r^3 - 47r^2 = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Factor the equation**: \n   The given equation is \\(115r^3 - 47r^2 = 0\\). We can factor out the common term \\(r^2\\):\n   \\[\n   r^2(115r - 47) = 0\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set each factor to zero**:\n   We have two factors: \\(r^2\\) and \\(115r - 47\\). We set each factor to zero to find the solutions.\n\n   - For \\(r^2 = 0\\):\n     \\[\n     r = 0\n     \\]\n     This gives us one solution: \\(r = 0\\).\n\n   - For \\(115r - 47 = 0\\):\n     \\[\n     115r = 47\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     r = \\frac{47}{115}\n     \\]\n     Calculating the decimal value:\n     \\[\n     r = 0.408695652173913\n     \\]\n     Rounding to four decimal places, we get:\n     \\[\n     r = 0.4086\n     \\]\n\n3. **List all solutions**:\n   The solutions to the equation are \\(r = 0\\) and \\(r = 0.4086\\).\n\n4. **Format the answer**:\n   Since there are two solutions, we list them as comma-separated decimal numbers.\n\nThe final answer, formatted as specified, is:\n\\[\n\\text{<<<}0.0000, 0.4086\\text{>>>}\n\\]"
