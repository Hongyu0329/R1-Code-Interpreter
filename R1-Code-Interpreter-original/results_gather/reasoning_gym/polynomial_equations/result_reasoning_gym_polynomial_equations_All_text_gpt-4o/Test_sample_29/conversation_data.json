    "To solve the equation \\(-64r - 4 = 0\\) for the real number \\(r\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Isolate the variable \\(r\\):**\n   - Start with the equation: \\(-64r - 4 = 0\\).\n   - Add 4 to both sides to move the constant term to the right side: \\(-64r = 4\\).\n\n2. **Solve for \\(r\\):**\n   - Divide both sides by \\(-64\\) to solve for \\(r\\): \n     \\[\n     r = \\frac{4}{-64}\n     \\]\n   - Simplify the fraction: \n     \\[\n     r = \\frac{1}{-16}\n     \\]\n   - Convert the fraction to a decimal: \n     \\[\n     r = -0.0625\n     \\]\n\n3. **Format the answer:**\n   - Since there is only one solution, we provide it as a single decimal number.\n   - Round the decimal to four decimal places (though in this case, it is already at four decimal places).\n\nThe final answer, formatted according to the instructions, is:\n\n<<<-0.0625>>>"
