    "To solve the equation \\(144 \\cdot o^3 = 0\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation is \\(144 \\cdot o^3 = 0\\). This is a simple cubic equation where the coefficient of \\(o^3\\) is 144.\n\n2. **Isolate the Variable**: To find the value of \\(o\\), we need to isolate it. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 144:\n   \\[\n   o^3 = \\frac{0}{144} = 0\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(o\\)**: The equation \\(o^3 = 0\\) implies that \\(o\\) must be a number whose cube is zero. The only real number that satisfies this condition is \\(o = 0\\).\n\n4. **Check for Additional Solutions**: Since this is a cubic equation, it could potentially have up to three real solutions. However, in this case, the only solution is \\(o = 0\\) because the equation simplifies directly to \\(o^3 = 0\\).\n\n5. **Format the Answer**: According to the instructions, we need to provide the solution as a decimal value, rounded to four decimal places. Since the solution is already an integer, it remains \\(0.0000\\).\n\n6. **Output the Answer**: Since there is only one solution, we format it as a single decimal number within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0.0000>>>"
