    "To solve the equation \\(7 - 128b^2 = 0\\) for real \\(b\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Rearrange the Equation**: Start by isolating the term with \\(b\\).\n   \\[\n   7 = 128b^2\n   \\]\n\n2. **Solve for \\(b^2\\)**: Divide both sides by 128 to solve for \\(b^2\\).\n   \\[\n   b^2 = \\frac{7}{128}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Take the Square Root**: To find \\(b\\), take the square root of both sides. Remember that taking the square root will yield both positive and negative solutions.\n   \\[\n   b = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{7}{128}}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Decimal Values**: Compute the square root and convert it to decimal form.\n   - First, calculate \\(\\frac{7}{128}\\):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{7}{128} \\approx 0.0546875\n     \\]\n   - Then, calculate the square root:\n     \\[\n     \\sqrt{0.0546875} \\approx 0.233853586673\n     \\]\n\n5. **Round the Decimal Values**: Round the decimal values to four decimal places.\n   - Positive solution: \\(0.2338\\)\n   - Negative solution: \\(-0.2338\\)\n\n6. **Format the Answer**: Since there are two solutions, format them as comma-separated decimal numbers.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<-0.2338, 0.2338>>>"
