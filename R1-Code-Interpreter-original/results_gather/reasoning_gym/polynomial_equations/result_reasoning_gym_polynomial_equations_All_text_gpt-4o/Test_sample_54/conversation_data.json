    "To solve the equation \\(91a^3 + 12 = 0\\), we need to find the real value(s) of \\(a\\).\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Isolate the Cubic Term:**\n   \\[\n   91a^3 = -12\n   \\]\n\n2. **Solve for \\(a^3\\):**\n   \\[\n   a^3 = \\frac{-12}{91}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Cube Root:**\n   \\[\n   a = \\sqrt[3]{\\frac{-12}{91}}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Convert to Decimal:**\n   - First, calculate \\(\\frac{-12}{91}\\):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{-12}{91} \\approx -0.1318681319\n     \\]\n   - Then, find the cube root of \\(-0.1318681319\\):\n     \\[\n     a \\approx -0.5095\n     \\]\n\n5. **Rounding:**\n   - The value \\(-0.5095\\) is already rounded to four decimal places.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe equation \\(91a^3 + 12 = 0\\) has one real solution. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{<<<-0.5095>>>}\n\\]"
