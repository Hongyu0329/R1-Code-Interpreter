    "To solve the equation \\(-8k^3 - 47k = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Factor the equation**: \n   The equation can be factored by taking out the common factor \\(k\\):\n   \\[\n   k(-8k^2 - 47) = 0\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set each factor to zero**:\n   - The first factor gives us:\n     \\[\n     k = 0\n     \\]\n   - The second factor gives us:\n     \\[\n     -8k^2 - 47 = 0\n     \\]\n\n3. **Solve the quadratic equation**:\n   For the quadratic equation \\(-8k^2 - 47 = 0\\), we solve for \\(k\\):\n   \\[\n   -8k^2 = 47\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   k^2 = -\\frac{47}{8}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Check for real solutions**:\n   Since \\(k^2 = -\\frac{47}{8}\\) results in a negative number, there are no real solutions for this part of the equation. The square of a real number cannot be negative.\n\n5. **Compile the real solutions**:\n   The only real solution from the factors is \\(k = 0\\).\n\n6. **Format the answer**:\n   Since there is only one real solution, we format it as a single decimal number.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\text{<<<0>>>}\n\\]"
