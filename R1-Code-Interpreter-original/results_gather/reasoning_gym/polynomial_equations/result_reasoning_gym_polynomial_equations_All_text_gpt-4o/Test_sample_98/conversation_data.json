    "To solve the equation \\(-21 \\cdot s^2 = 0\\), we need to find the real value(s) of \\(s\\) that satisfy this equation. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation given is \\(-21 \\cdot s^2 = 0\\). This is a quadratic equation in the form of \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), where \\(a = -21\\), \\(b = 0\\), and \\(c = 0\\).\n\n2. **Simplify the Equation**: Since the equation is \\(-21 \\cdot s^2 = 0\\), we can divide both sides by \\(-21\\) (as long as \\(-21\\) is not zero, which it isn't) to simplify the equation to:\n   \\[\n   s^2 = 0\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(s\\)**: The equation \\(s^2 = 0\\) implies that \\(s\\) must be a number whose square is zero. The only real number that satisfies this condition is:\n   \\[\n   s = 0\n   \\]\n\n4. **Check the Number of Solutions**: Since \\(s^2 = 0\\) has only one solution, \\(s = 0\\), we have a single solution.\n\n5. **Format the Answer**: According to the instructions, for a single solution, we should provide the answer as a single decimal number. The solution \\(s = 0\\) is already in decimal form.\n\n6. **Round the Solution**: The solution \\(s = 0\\) is already a whole number, so rounding to four decimal places does not change it.\n\n7. **Final Answer**: Enclose the answer within triple angle brackets as specified.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0.0000>>>"
