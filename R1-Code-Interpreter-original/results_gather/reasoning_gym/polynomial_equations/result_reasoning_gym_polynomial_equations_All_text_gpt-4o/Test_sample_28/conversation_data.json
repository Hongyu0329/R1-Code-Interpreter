    "To solve the quadratic equation \\(-62l^2 + 6l + 55 = 0\\) for real values of \\(l\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the coefficients**: The equation is in the standard form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), where:\n   - \\(a = -62\\)\n   - \\(b = 6\\)\n   - \\(c = 55\\)\n\n2. **Calculate the discriminant**: The discriminant \\(\\Delta\\) of a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values:\n   \\[\n   \\Delta = 6^2 - 4(-62)(55) = 36 + 13640 = 13676\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the nature of the roots**: Since the discriminant \\(\\Delta = 13676\\) is positive, the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots.\n\n4. **Calculate the roots using the quadratic formula**: The roots of the equation are given by:\n   \\[\n   l = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{\\Delta}}{2a}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values:\n   \\[\n   l = \\frac{-6 \\pm \\sqrt{13676}}{-124}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate \\(\\sqrt{13676}\\)**: \n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{13676} \\approx 116.9333\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the two roots**:\n   - First root:\n     \\[\n     l_1 = \\frac{-6 + 116.9333}{-124} = \\frac{110.9333}{-124} \\approx -0.8946\n     \\]\n   - Second root:\n     \\[\n     l_2 = \\frac{-6 - 116.9333}{-124} = \\frac{-122.9333}{-124} \\approx 0.9912\n     \\]\n\n7. **Round the roots to four decimal places**: The roots are already rounded to four decimal places.\n\n8. **Format the answer**: Since there are two solutions, we list them as comma-separated decimal numbers.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<-0.8946, 0.9912>>>"
