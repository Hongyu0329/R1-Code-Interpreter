    "To solve the equation \\(51k + 73 = 0\\) for the real value(s) of \\(k\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Isolate the variable \\(k\\):**\n   - Start with the equation: \\(51k + 73 = 0\\).\n   - Subtract 73 from both sides to isolate the term with \\(k\\): \n     \\[\n     51k = -73\n     \\]\n\n2. **Solve for \\(k\\):**\n   - Divide both sides by 51 to solve for \\(k\\):\n     \\[\n     k = \\frac{-73}{51}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Convert the fraction to a decimal:**\n   - Calculate the decimal value of \\(\\frac{-73}{51}\\):\n     \\[\n     k \\approx -1.431372549\n     \\]\n\n4. **Round the decimal to 4 decimal places:**\n   - Round \\(-1.431372549\\) to 4 decimal places:\n     \\[\n     k \\approx -1.4313\n     \\]\n\n5. **Format the answer:**\n   - Since there is only one solution, format the answer as a single decimal number enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<-1.4313>>>"
