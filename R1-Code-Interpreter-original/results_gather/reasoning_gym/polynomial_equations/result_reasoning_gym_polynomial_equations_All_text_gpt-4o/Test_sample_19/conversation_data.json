    "To solve the equation \\(-71h^3 + 182h = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Factor the equation**: \n   The given equation is \\(-71h^3 + 182h = 0\\). We can factor out an \\(h\\) from each term:\n   \\[\n   h(-71h^2 + 182) = 0\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set each factor to zero**:\n   This gives us two separate equations to solve:\n   \\[\n   h = 0\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   -71h^2 + 182 = 0\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve the first equation**:\n   The first equation \\(h = 0\\) is straightforward. One solution is:\n   \\[\n   h = 0\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve the second equation**:\n   For the second equation \\(-71h^2 + 182 = 0\\), we can solve for \\(h^2\\):\n   \\[\n   -71h^2 = -182\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   h^2 = \\frac{182}{71}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the square root**:\n   To find \\(h\\), take the square root of both sides:\n   \\[\n   h = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{182}{71}}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Convert to decimal form**:\n   Calculate the decimal values for \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{182}{71}}\\):\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{\\frac{182}{71}} \\approx 1.5970\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the solutions are:\n   \\[\n   h = 1.5970, \\quad h = -1.5970\n   \\]\n\n7. **List all solutions**:\n   We have three solutions: \\(h = 0\\), \\(h = 1.5970\\), and \\(h = -1.5970\\).\n\n8. **Format the final answer**:\n   According to the instructions, we need to provide all solutions as comma-separated decimal values, rounded to four decimal places.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\text{<<<}0.0000, 1.5970, -1.5970\\text{>>>}\n\\]"
