    "To solve the equation \\(56t = 0\\), we need to find the value of \\(t\\) that satisfies this equation. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation given is \\(56t = 0\\). This is a simple linear equation where \\(t\\) is multiplied by 56.\n\n2. **Isolate the Variable**: To find the value of \\(t\\), we need to isolate it. Since \\(t\\) is multiplied by 56, we can divide both sides of the equation by 56 to solve for \\(t\\).\n\n3. **Perform the Division**: \n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{0}{56}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the Expression**: \n   \\[\n   t = 0\n   \\]\n   Dividing zero by any non-zero number results in zero.\n\n5. **Check the Solution**: Substitute \\(t = 0\\) back into the original equation to verify:\n   \\[\n   56 \\times 0 = 0\n   \\]\n   The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming that \\(t = 0\\) is indeed a solution.\n\n6. **Determine the Number of Solutions**: Since the equation is linear and we have found one solution, there is exactly one real solution.\n\n7. **Format the Answer**: According to the instructions, for one solution, we provide a single decimal number. The solution is already in decimal form and does not require rounding.\n\nThe final answer, formatted as specified, is:\n\\[\n\\text{<<<0>>>}\n\\]"
