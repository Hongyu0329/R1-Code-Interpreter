    "To solve the equation \\(-60u - 86 = 0\\) for real \\(u\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Isolate the variable \\(u\\):**\n   - Start with the equation: \\(-60u - 86 = 0\\).\n   - Add 86 to both sides to isolate the term with \\(u\\): \\(-60u = 86\\).\n\n2. **Solve for \\(u\\):**\n   - Divide both sides by \\(-60\\) to solve for \\(u\\): \n     \\[\n     u = \\frac{86}{-60}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the fraction:**\n   - Calculate the decimal value of \\(\\frac{86}{-60}\\):\n     \\[\n     u = -1.4333\\overline{3}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Round the decimal value:**\n   - Round \\(-1.4333\\overline{3}\\) to four decimal places:\n     \\[\n     u = -1.4333\n     \\]\n\n5. **Format the answer:**\n   - Since there is only one solution, we provide it as a single decimal number.\n\nThe final answer, rounded and formatted according to the instructions, is:\n\n<<<-1.4333>>>"
