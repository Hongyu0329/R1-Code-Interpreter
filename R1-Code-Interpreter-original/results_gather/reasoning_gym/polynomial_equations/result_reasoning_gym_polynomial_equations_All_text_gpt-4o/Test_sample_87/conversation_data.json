    "To solve the equation \\(87l - 3 = 0\\) for the real value(s) of \\(l\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Isolate the variable \\(l\\):**\n   - Start with the equation: \\(87l - 3 = 0\\).\n   - Add 3 to both sides to get: \\(87l = 3\\).\n\n2. **Solve for \\(l\\):**\n   - Divide both sides by 87 to isolate \\(l\\): \n     \\[\n     l = \\frac{3}{87}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the fraction:**\n   - Simplify \\(\\frac{3}{87}\\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:\n     \\[\n     l = \\frac{1}{29}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Convert to decimal form:**\n   - Calculate the decimal value of \\(\\frac{1}{29}\\):\n     \\[\n     l \\approx 0.0344827586\n     \\]\n\n5. **Round the decimal value:**\n   - Round \\(0.0344827586\\) to four decimal places:\n     \\[\n     l \\approx 0.0344\n     \\]\n\n6. **Format the answer:**\n   - Since there is only one solution, format the answer as a single decimal number enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0.0344>>>"
