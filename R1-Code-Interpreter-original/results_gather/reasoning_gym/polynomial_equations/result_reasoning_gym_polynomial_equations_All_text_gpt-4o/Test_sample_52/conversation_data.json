    "To solve the equation \\( z^2 - 85z = 0 \\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the type of equation**: The given equation is a quadratic equation in the form \\( az^2 + bz + c = 0 \\), where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -85 \\), and \\( c = 0 \\).\n\n2. **Factor the equation**: Since the equation is quadratic and \\( c = 0 \\), we can factor out \\( z \\) from the equation:\n   \\[\n   z(z - 85) = 0\n   \\]\n\n3. **Apply the zero product property**: According to the zero product property, if the product of two factors is zero, then at least one of the factors must be zero. Therefore, we set each factor equal to zero:\n   \\[\n   z = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad z - 85 = 0\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve each equation**:\n   - For \\( z = 0 \\), the solution is \\( z = 0 \\).\n   - For \\( z - 85 = 0 \\), solve for \\( z \\) by adding 85 to both sides:\n     \\[\n     z = 85\n     \\]\n\n5. **List the solutions**: The solutions to the equation are \\( z = 0 \\) and \\( z = 85 \\).\n\n6. **Convert solutions to decimal form**: Both solutions are already in decimal form.\n\n7. **Format the answer**: Since there are two solutions, we list them as comma-separated decimal numbers.\n\n8. **Round the solutions**: Both solutions are integers, so no rounding is necessary.\n\n9. **Enclose the answer within triple angle brackets**: The final answer is formatted as required.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0.0000, 85.0000>>>"
