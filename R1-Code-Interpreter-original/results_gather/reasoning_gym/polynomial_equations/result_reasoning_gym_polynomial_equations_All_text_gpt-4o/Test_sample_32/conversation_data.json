    "To solve the equation \\(116r + 126 = 0\\) for the real number \\(r\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Isolate the variable \\(r\\):**\n   - Start by subtracting 126 from both sides of the equation to get:\n     \\[\n     116r = -126\n     \\]\n\n2. **Solve for \\(r\\):**\n   - Divide both sides of the equation by 116 to solve for \\(r\\):\n     \\[\n     r = \\frac{-126}{116}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Convert the fraction to a decimal:**\n   - Calculate the decimal value of \\(\\frac{-126}{116}\\):\n     \\[\n     r \\approx -1.086206896551724\n     \\]\n\n4. **Round the decimal to four decimal places:**\n   - Round \\(-1.086206896551724\\) to four decimal places:\n     \\[\n     r \\approx -1.0862\n     \\]\n\n5. **Format the answer:**\n   - Since there is only one solution, the answer should be a single decimal number enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{<<<-1.0862>>>}\n\\]"
