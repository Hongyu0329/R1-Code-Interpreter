    "To solve the equation \\(106c^2 = 0\\) for real \\(c\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation is a quadratic equation in the form \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), where \\(a = 106\\), \\(b = 0\\), and \\(c = 0\\).\n\n2. **Simplify the Equation**: Since the equation is \\(106c^2 = 0\\), we can divide both sides by 106 to simplify it to \\(c^2 = 0\\).\n\n3. **Solve for \\(c\\)**: The equation \\(c^2 = 0\\) implies that \\(c\\) must be a number whose square is zero. The only real number that satisfies this condition is \\(c = 0\\).\n\n4. **Check the Number of Solutions**: Since \\(c^2 = 0\\) has only one solution, \\(c = 0\\), we have a single solution.\n\n5. **Format the Answer**: According to the instructions, for a single solution, we provide the answer as a single decimal number. Therefore, the solution is \\(0.0000\\).\n\n6. **Round the Solution**: The solution \\(c = 0\\) is already in decimal form and rounded to four decimal places as \\(0.0000\\).\n\n7. **Output the Answer**: Enclose the answer within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<0.0000>>>"
