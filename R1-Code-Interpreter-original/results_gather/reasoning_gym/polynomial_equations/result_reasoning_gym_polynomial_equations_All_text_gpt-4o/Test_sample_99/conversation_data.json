    "To solve the polynomial equation \\(-3m^2 - 14m - 16 = 0\\) for real \\(m\\), we will use the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nwhere \\(a = -3\\), \\(b = -14\\), and \\(c = -16\\).\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the discriminant**\n\nThe discriminant \\(\\Delta\\) is given by:\n\n\\[ \\Delta = b^2 - 4ac \\]\n\nSubstitute the values of \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\):\n\n\\[ \\Delta = (-14)^2 - 4(-3)(-16) \\]\n\\[ \\Delta = 196 - 192 \\]\n\\[ \\Delta = 4 \\]\n\nSince the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real solutions.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the quadratic formula**\n\nNow, substitute the values into the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[ m = \\frac{-(-14) \\pm \\sqrt{4}}{2(-3)} \\]\n\\[ m = \\frac{14 \\pm 2}{-6} \\]\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the two solutions**\n\n1.
