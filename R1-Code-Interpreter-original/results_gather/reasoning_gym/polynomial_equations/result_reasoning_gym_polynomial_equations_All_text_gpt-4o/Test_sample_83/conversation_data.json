    "To solve the equation \\(43l + 71 = 0\\) for the real value(s) of \\(l\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Isolate the variable \\(l\\):**\n   - Start with the equation: \\(43l + 71 = 0\\).\n   - Subtract 71 from both sides to isolate the term with \\(l\\): \n     \\[\n     43l = -71\n     \\]\n\n2. **Solve for \\(l\\):**\n   - Divide both sides by 43 to solve for \\(l\\):\n     \\[\n     l = \\frac{-71}{43}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Convert the solution to decimal form:**\n   - Calculate \\(\\frac{-71}{43}\\) to get the decimal value:\n     \\[\n     l \\approx -1.6511627906976744\n     \\]\n\n4. **Round the decimal value:**\n   - Round \\(-1.6511627906976744\\) to four decimal places:\n     \\[\n     l \\approx -1.6511\n     \\]\n\n5. **Format the answer:**\n   - Since there is only one solution, we format it as a single decimal number enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<-1.6511>>>"
