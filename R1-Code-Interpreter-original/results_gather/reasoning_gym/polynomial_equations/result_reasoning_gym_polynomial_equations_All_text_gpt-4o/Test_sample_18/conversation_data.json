    "To solve the equation \\(-28t = 0\\), we need to find the value(s) of \\(t\\) that satisfy this equation. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation given is \\(-28t = 0\\). This is a linear equation in one variable, \\(t\\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Variable**: To find the value of \\(t\\), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by \\(-28\\).\n\n3. **Perform the Division**: \n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{0}{-28}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the Expression**: \n   \\[\n   t = 0\n   \\]\n\n5. **Check the Solution**: Substitute \\(t = 0\\) back into the original equation to verify:\n   \\[\n   -28 \\times 0 = 0\n   \\]\n   The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming that \\(t = 0\\) is indeed a solution.\n\n6. **Determine the Number of Solutions**: Since we have found one solution, we need to format the answer according to the instructions provided.\n\n7. **Format the Answer**: Since there is only one solution, we provide it as a single decimal number. The solution is already in decimal form and does not require rounding.\n\nThe final answer, formatted as instructed, is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
