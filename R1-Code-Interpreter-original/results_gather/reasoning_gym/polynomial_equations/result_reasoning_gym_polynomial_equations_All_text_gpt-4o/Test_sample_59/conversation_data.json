    "To solve the polynomial equation \\(52c^3 - 96c = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Factor the equation**: \n   The given equation is \\(52c^3 - 96c = 0\\). We can factor out the common term \\(c\\):\n   \\[\n   c(52c^2 - 96) = 0\n   \\]\n\n2. **Solve for \\(c\\)**:\n   - The first factor gives us a solution directly: \\(c = 0\\).\n   - For the second factor, set \\(52c^2 - 96 = 0\\) and solve for \\(c\\).\n\n3. **Solve the quadratic equation**:\n   \\[\n   52c^2 - 96 = 0\n   \\]\n   Add 96 to both sides:\n   \\[\n   52c^2 = 96\n   \\]\n   Divide both sides by 52:\n   \\[\n   c^2 = \\frac{96}{52}\n   \\]\n   Simplify the fraction:\n   \\[\n   c^2 = \\frac{24}{13}\n   \\]\n   Take the square root of both sides:\n   \\[\n   c = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{24}{13}}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Convert to decimal form**:\n   Calculate the decimal values for \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{24}{13}}\\):\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{\\frac{24}{13}} \\approx 1.3608\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the solutions are \\(c = 1.3608\\) and \\(c = -1.3608\\).\n\n5. **List all solutions**:\n   We have three solutions: \\(c = 0\\), \\(c = 1.3608\\), and \\(c = -1.3608\\).\n\n6. **Format the answer**:\n   According to the instructions, we need to provide all solutions as comma-separated decimal values and enclose them within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0.0000, 1.3608, -1.3608>>>"
