    "To solve the polynomial equation \\(-28c = 0\\) for real \\(c\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Type of Equation**: The given equation is a linear equation in the form of \\(ax = 0\\), where \\(a = -28\\) and \\(x = c\\).\n\n2. **Solve the Equation**: \n   - The equation \\(-28c = 0\\) implies that the product of \\(-28\\) and \\(c\\) is zero.\n   - For a product to be zero, at least one of the factors must be zero.\n   - Since \\(-28\\) is a non-zero constant, the only way for the product to be zero is if \\(c = 0\\).\n\n3. **Determine the Number of Solutions**: \n   - The equation \\(-28c = 0\\) has exactly one solution, which is \\(c = 0\\).\n\n4. **Format the Solution**: \n   - Since there is only one solution, we provide it as a single decimal number.\n   - The solution \\(c = 0\\) is already in decimal form and does not require rounding.\n\n5. **Final Answer**: \n   - According to the instructions, we need to enclose the answer within triple angle brackets.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the equation \\(-28c = 0\\) is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
