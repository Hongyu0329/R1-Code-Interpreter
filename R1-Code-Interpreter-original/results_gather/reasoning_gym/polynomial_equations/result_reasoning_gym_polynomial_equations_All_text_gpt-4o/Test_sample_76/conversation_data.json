    "To solve the equation \\(-68 \\cdot e^3 = 0\\), we need to find the real value(s) of \\(e\\) that satisfy this equation. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation is \\(-68 \\cdot e^3 = 0\\). This implies that the product of \\(-68\\) and \\(e^3\\) is zero.\n\n2. **Zero Product Property**: According to the zero product property, if a product of two or more factors is zero, at least one of the factors must be zero. Here, the factors are \\(-68\\) and \\(e^3\\).\n\n3. **Analyze the Factors**:\n   - The factor \\(-68\\) is a constant and is not zero.\n   - Therefore, for the product to be zero, the other factor, \\(e^3\\), must be zero.\n\n4. **Solve for \\(e\\)**: \n   - If \\(e^3 = 0\\), then \\(e\\) must be zero because the cube of zero is zero.\n\n5. **Determine the Real Solution**: The only real value of \\(e\\) that satisfies the equation is \\(e = 0\\).\n\n6. **Format the Answer**: Since there is only one solution, we format the answer as a single decimal number.\n\n7. **Round the Solution**: The solution \\(e = 0\\) is already a decimal number and does not require rounding.\n\n8. **Final Answer**: According to the instructions, we enclose the answer within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
