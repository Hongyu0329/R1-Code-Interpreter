    "To solve the equation \\(127h - 132 = 0\\) for the real value of \\(h\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Isolate the variable \\(h\\):**\n   - Start with the equation: \\(127h - 132 = 0\\).\n   - Add 132 to both sides to isolate the term with \\(h\\): \n     \\[\n     127h = 132\n     \\]\n\n2. **Solve for \\(h\\):**\n   - Divide both sides by 127 to solve for \\(h\\):\n     \\[\n     h = \\frac{132}{127}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Convert the solution to decimal form:**\n   - Calculate the decimal value of \\(\\frac{132}{127}\\):\n     \\[\n     h \\approx 1.03937007874\n     \\]\n\n4. **Round the decimal value:**\n   - Round the decimal value to four decimal places:\n     \\[\n     h \\approx 1.0393\n     \\]\n\n5. **Format the answer:**\n   - Since there is only one solution, format the answer as a single decimal number within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<1.0393>>>"
