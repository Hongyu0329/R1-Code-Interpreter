For solutions that can be expressed in exact form (like \"u = 2 + sqrt(4560)/172\" and \"u = 2 - sqrt(4560)/172\"), convert them to decimal form in your final answer.\n3. If there are no real values that satisfy the equation, report your answer as an empty string: \"\"\n4. Format your answer based on the number of solutions:\n   - For 1 solution: a single decimal number\n   - For 2 solutions: two comma-separated decimal numbers\n   - For 3 or more solutions: all values as comma-separated decimal numbers\n   - Enclose the answer within triple angle brackets, like <<<number/numbers>>>.\n5. Round all decimal values to 4 decimal places (rounding down when the 5th decimal place is 5 or greater).\n",

    "To solve the equation \\( t = 0 \\) for real \\( t \\), we need to analyze the equation step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Type of Equation**: The equation \\( t = 0 \\) is a simple linear equation where \\( t \\) is already isolated.\n\n2. **Determine the Solution**: Since the equation is already in the form \\( t = 0 \\), the solution is straightforward. The value of \\( t \\) that satisfies this equation is \\( t = 0 \\).\n\n3. **Check for Real Solutions**: The solution \\( t = 0 \\) is a real number, so it satisfies the requirement for real solutions.\n\n4. **Format the Solution**: According to the instructions, for a single solution, we should provide the answer as a single decimal number. The number 0 in decimal form is 0.0000.\n\n5. **Round the Solution**: The number 0.0000 is already rounded to four decimal places.\n\n6. **Output the Solution**: Enclose the solution within triple angle brackets as specified.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<0.0000>>>"
