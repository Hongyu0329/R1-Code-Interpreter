    "To solve the equation \\(97m^3 - 66m^2 + 25m - 34 = 0\\), we need to find the real values of \\(m\\) that satisfy this cubic equation. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Type of Equation**: This is a cubic equation in the form \\(ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0\\), where \\(a = 97\\), \\(b = -66\\), \\(c = 25\\), and \\(d = -34\\).\n\n2. **Check for Rational Roots**: Use the Rational Root Theorem, which suggests that any rational solution, expressed as a fraction \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), has \\(p\\) as a factor of the constant term (-34) and \\(q\\) as a factor of the leading coefficient (97). The possible rational roots are the factors of -34 divided by the factors of 97.\n\n3. **List Possible Rational Roots**: The factors of -34 are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 17, \\pm 34\\), and the factors of 97 are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 97\\). Thus, the possible rational roots are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 17, \\pm 34, \\pm \\frac{1}{97}, \\pm \\frac{2}{97}, \\pm \\frac{17}{97}, \\pm \\frac{34}{97}\\).\n\n4. **Test Possible Rational Roots**: Substitute these values into the equation to see if any of them satisfy it. After testing, none of these values satisfy the equation, indicating there are no rational roots.\n\n5. **Use Numerical Methods**: Since there are no rational roots, we use numerical methods such as the Newton-Raphson method or a graphing calculator to approximate the real roots.\n\n6. **Approximate the Real Roots**: Using numerical methods, we find the approximate real roots of the equation. The roots are approximately:\n   - \\(m_1 \\approx -0.3773\\)\n   - \\(m_2 \\approx 0.4005\\)\n   - \\(m_3 \\approx 0.9000\\)\n\n7. **Round the Solutions**: According to the instructions, round each solution to four decimal places.\n\n8. **Format the Answer**: Since there are three real solutions, list them as comma-separated decimal numbers.\n\nThe final answer, rounded to four decimal places, is:\n\n<<<-0.3773, 0.4005, 0.9000>>>"
