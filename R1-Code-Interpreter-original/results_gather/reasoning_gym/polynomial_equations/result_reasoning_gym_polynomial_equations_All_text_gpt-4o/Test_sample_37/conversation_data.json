    "To solve the polynomial equation \\(9x + 42 = 0\\) for real \\(x\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Isolate the variable \\(x\\):**\n   - Start with the equation: \\(9x + 42 = 0\\).\n   - Subtract 42 from both sides to isolate the term with \\(x\\): \n     \\[\n     9x = -42\n     \\]\n\n2. **Solve for \\(x\\):**\n   - Divide both sides by 9 to solve for \\(x\\):\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{-42}{9}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the fraction:**\n   - Simplify \\(\\frac{-42}{9}\\) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:\n     \\[\n     x = \\frac{-42 \\div 3}{9 \\div 3} = \\frac{-14}{3}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Convert to decimal form:**\n   - Convert \\(\\frac{-14}{3}\\) to a decimal:\n     \\[\n     x = -4.6666\\ldots\n     \\]\n   - Round to four decimal places:\n     \\[\n     x = -4.6666\n     \\]\n\n5. **Format the answer:**\n   - Since there is only one solution, format the answer as a single decimal number enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<-4.6666>>>"
