    "To solve the equation \\(16c = 0\\) for the real number \\(c\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Equation**: The equation \\(16c = 0\\) is a linear equation in one variable, \\(c\\).\n\n2. **Isolate the Variable**: To solve for \\(c\\), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. This can be done by dividing both sides of the equation by 16.\n\n   \\[\n   c = \\frac{0}{16}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the Expression**: The right-hand side simplifies to 0 because any number divided by a non-zero number is 0.\n\n   \\[\n   c = 0\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the Number of Solutions**: Since this is a linear equation and we have isolated \\(c\\) to find a single value, there is exactly one solution.\n\n5. **Format the Solution**: According to the instructions, for one solution, we provide a single decimal number. The solution is already in decimal form and does not require further conversion.\n\n6. **Round the Solution**: The solution \\(c = 0\\) is already a decimal number and does not require rounding.\n\n7. **Output the Solution**: Format the solution within triple angle brackets as specified.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
