    "To solve the equation \\(-85q^2 - 181q = 0\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Factor the equation**: \n   The given equation is \\(-85q^2 - 181q = 0\\). We can factor out a common term, which is \\(q\\), from both terms:\n   \\[\n   q(-85q - 181) = 0\n   \\]\n\n2. **Apply the zero product property**:\n   The zero product property states that if a product of factors equals zero, then at least one of the factors must be zero. Therefore, we set each factor equal to zero:\n   \\[\n   q = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad -85q - 181 = 0\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve each equation**:\n   - For the first equation \\(q = 0\\), the solution is straightforward: \\(q = 0\\).\n   - For the second equation \\(-85q - 181 = 0\\), solve for \\(q\\):\n     \\[\n     -85q = 181\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     q = \\frac{181}{-85}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     q = -\\frac{181}{85}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Convert the fraction to a decimal**:\n   Calculate the decimal value of \\(-\\frac{181}{85}\\):\n   \\[\n   q \\approx -2.1294\n   \\]\n\n5. **List the solutions**:\n   We have two solutions: \\(q = 0\\) and \\(q \\approx -2.1294\\).\n\n6. **Format the answer**:\n   According to the instructions, we need to provide the solutions as comma-separated decimal values, rounded to four decimal places. Since we have two solutions, we format them as:\n   \\[\n   0.0000, -2.1294\n   \\]\n\n7. **Enclose the answer within triple angle brackets**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Final Answer:} \\quad <<<0.0000, -2.1294>>>\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the real values of \\(q\\) that satisfy the equation are:\n\n<<<0.0000, -2.1294>>>"
