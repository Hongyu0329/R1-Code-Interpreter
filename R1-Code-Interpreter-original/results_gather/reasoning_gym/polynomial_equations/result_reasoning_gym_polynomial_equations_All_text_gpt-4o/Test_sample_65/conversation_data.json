    "To solve the equation \\(99g^2 - 6 = 0\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Rearrange the Equation**: Start by isolating the term with \\(g\\).\n   \\[\n   99g^2 = 6\n   \\]\n\n2. **Solve for \\(g^2\\)**: Divide both sides by 99 to solve for \\(g^2\\).\n   \\[\n   g^2 = \\frac{6}{99}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the Fraction**: Simplify \\(\\frac{6}{99}\\).\n   \\[\n   g^2 = \\frac{2}{33}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\(g\\)**: Take the square root of both sides to solve for \\(g\\).\n   \\[\n   g = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{33}}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the Decimal Values**: Compute the decimal values for \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{33}}\\).\n   - First, calculate \\(\\frac{2}{33} \\approx 0.0606060606\\).\n   - Then, find the square root: \\(\\sqrt{0.0606060606} \\approx 0.2461829819\\).\n\n6. **Round the Decimal Values**: Round the decimal values to four decimal places.\n   - Positive root: \\(0.2461\\)\n   - Negative root: \\(-0.2461\\)\n\n7. **Format the Answer**: Since there are two solutions, list them as comma-separated decimal numbers.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n<<<-0.2461, 0.2461>>>\n\\]"
