    "To determine whether the conclusion \"No lions are cats\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the statements step by step.\n\n1. **Statement 1: All lions are spiders.**\n   - This means that every lion is included in the category of spiders. In other words, the set of lions is a subset of the set of spiders.\n\n2. **Statement 2: No spiders are cats.**\n   - This means that there is no overlap between the set of spiders and the set of cats. In other words, the set of spiders and the set of cats are mutually exclusive.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion:\n\n- **Conclusion: No lions are cats.**\n  - Since all lions are spiders (from Statement 1), and no spiders are cats (from Statement 2), it logically follows that no lions can be cats. This is because if lions were cats, then they would also be spiders (since all lions are spiders), which contradicts Statement 2 that no spiders are cats.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"No lions are cats\" logically follows from the given statements.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Yes>>>"
