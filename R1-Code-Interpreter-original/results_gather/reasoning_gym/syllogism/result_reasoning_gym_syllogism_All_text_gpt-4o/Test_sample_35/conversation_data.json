    "To determine whether the conclusion \"Some parents are not butterflies\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical relationships step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - **Statement 1:** \"Some parents are students.\"\n     - This means there is at least one individual who is both a parent and a student.\n   - **Statement 2:** \"No students are butterflies.\"\n     - This means there is no individual who is both a student and a butterfly.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Relationship:**\n   - From Statement 1, we know there is at least one individual who is a parent and a student.\n   - From Statement 2, we know that this individual (who is a student) cannot be a butterfly because no students are butterflies.\n\n3. **Drawing the Conclusion:**\n   - Since we have identified at least one individual who is a parent and a student, and this individual cannot be a butterfly (from Statement 2), it logically follows that at least some parents (specifically, those who are also students) are not butterflies.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The conclusion \"Some parents are not butterflies\" logically follows from the given statements because we have identified a specific subset of parents (those who are students) who cannot be butterflies.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
