    "To determine whether the conclusion \"Some fish are children\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the statements step by step.\n\n1. **Statement 1: Some children are fish.**\n   - This statement indicates that there is at least one child who is also a fish. It establishes a relationship between the set of children and the set of fish, specifically that there is an overlap between these two sets.\n\n2. **Statement 2: Some fish are not humans.**\n   - This statement indicates that there is at least one fish that is not a human. It establishes that the set of fish is not entirely contained within the set of humans, meaning there are fish that do not belong to the set of humans.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion:\n\n- **Conclusion: Some fish are children.**\n  - This conclusion is asking whether there is an overlap between the set of fish and the set of children.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- From Statement 1, we know that there is an overlap between the set of children and the set of fish. Specifically, it tells us that some children are indeed fish.\n- Statement 2 does not affect the relationship between fish and children; it only provides information about the relationship between fish and humans.\n\nGiven that Statement 1 already establishes that some children are fish, it directly supports the conclusion that some fish are children. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the given statements.\n\nThus, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
