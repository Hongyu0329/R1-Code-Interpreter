    "To determine whether the conclusion \"Some tigers are not humans\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - **Statement 1:** \"All tigers are birds.\"\n     - This means every tiger is included in the category of birds. There is no tiger that is not a bird.\n   - **Statement 2:** \"Some birds are not humans.\"\n     - This means there exists at least one bird that is not a human. Not all birds are humans.\n\n2. **Translating Statements into Logical Form:**\n   - **Statement 1:** If something is a tiger, then it is a bird. (Tigers ⊆ Birds)\n   - **Statement 2:** There exists at least one bird that is not a human. (∃x (Bird(x) ∧ ¬Human(x)))\n\n3. **Analyzing the Conclusion:**\n   - **Conclusion:** \"Some tigers are not humans.\"\n     - This means there exists at least one tiger that is not a human. (∃x (Tiger(x) ∧ ¬Human(x)))\n\n4. **Logical Deduction:**\n   - From Statement 1, we know that all tigers are birds.\n   - From Statement 2, we know that there are some birds that are not humans.\n   - Since all tigers are birds, and some birds are not humans, it is possible that the tigers that are birds could be among those birds that are not humans.\n\n5. **Conclusion Verification:**\n   - Since there are some birds that are not humans, and all tigers are birds, it logically follows that some tigers could be among those birds that are not humans.\n   - Therefore, the conclusion \"Some tigers are not humans\" is logically consistent with the given premises.\n\n### Final Answer:\nBased on the logical analysis, the conclusion does follow from the given statements.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
