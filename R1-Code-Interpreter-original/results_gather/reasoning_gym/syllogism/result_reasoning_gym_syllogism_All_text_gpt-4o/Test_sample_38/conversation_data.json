    "To determine whether the conclusion \"No students are spiders\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Premises:**\n   - Premise 1: All students are animals.\n   - Premise 2: No animals are spiders.\n\n2. **Translate the Premises into Logical Form:**\n   - Premise 1 can be translated to: If something is a student, then it is an animal.\n   - Premise 2 can be translated to: If something is an animal, then it is not a spider.\n\n3. **Analyze the Conclusion:**\n   - Conclusion: No students are spiders.\n\n4. **Determine the Logical Relationship:**\n   - From Premise 1, we know that every student is an animal.\n   - From Premise 2, we know that no animal can be a spider.\n   - Therefore, if all students are animals and no animals are spiders, it logically follows that no students can be spiders.\n\n5. **Check for Logical Consistency:**\n   - The conclusion \"No students are spiders\" is consistent with the premises because:\n     - If all students are animals (Premise 1) and no animals are spiders (Premise 2), then it is impossible for any student to be a spider.\n\n6. **Final Conclusion:**\n   - The conclusion \"No students are spiders\" logically follows from the given premises.\n\nBased on the analysis, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
