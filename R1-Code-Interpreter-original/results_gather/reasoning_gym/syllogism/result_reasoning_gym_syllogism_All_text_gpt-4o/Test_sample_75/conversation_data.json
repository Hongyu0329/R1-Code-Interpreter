    "To determine whether the conclusion \"Some engineers are horses\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the statements step by step.\n\n1. **Statement 1: Some engineers are bees.**\n   - This means there is at least one engineer who is also a bee. We can represent this as a partial overlap between the set of engineers and the set of bees.\n\n2. **Statement 2: All bees are horses.**\n   - This means every bee is also a horse. In terms of set theory, the set of bees is entirely contained within the set of horses.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion:\n\n- **Conclusion: Some engineers are horses.**\n  - We need to determine if there is a logical connection that allows us to conclude that some engineers are also horses based on the given statements.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n- From Statement 1, we know that there is at least one individual who is both an engineer and a bee.\n- From Statement 2, we know that all bees are horses. Therefore, any individual who is a bee is also a horse.\n- Combining these two statements, the individual who is both an engineer and a bee must also be a horse, because all bees are horses.\n\nTherefore, it logically follows that some engineers are horses, because the engineer who is a bee is also a horse.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe conclusion \"Some engineers are horses\" logically follows from the given statements.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<Yes>>>"
