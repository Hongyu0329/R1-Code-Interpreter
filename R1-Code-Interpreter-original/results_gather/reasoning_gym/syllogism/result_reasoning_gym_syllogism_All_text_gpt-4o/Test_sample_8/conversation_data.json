    "To determine whether the conclusion \"Some children are tigers\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the statements step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - Statement 1: \"No spiders are tigers\" means that there is no overlap between the set of spiders and the set of tigers. In other words, the set of spiders and the set of tigers are completely separate.\n   - Statement 2: \"No tigers are children\" means that there is no overlap between the set of tigers and the set of children. The set of tigers and the set of children are also completely separate.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Conclusion:**\n   - The conclusion \"Some children are tigers\" suggests that there is at least some overlap between the set of children and the set of tigers.\n\n3. **Logical Analysis:**\n   - From Statement 2, we know that there is no overlap between the set of tigers and the set of children. This directly contradicts the conclusion that \"Some children are tigers,\" which requires an overlap.\n   - Since Statement 2 explicitly states that no tigers are children, it is impossible for any children to be tigers.\n\n4. **Final Conclusion:**\n   - Given the information from the statements, the conclusion \"Some children are tigers\" does not logically follow. The statements clearly indicate that there is no overlap between the set of tigers and the set of children.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
