    "To determine whether the conclusion \"All grandparents are spiders\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements step by step.\n\n1. **Statement 1: All elephants are spiders.**\n   - This means that every member of the category \"elephants\" is also a member of the category \"spiders.\"\n   - In logical terms, the set of elephants is a subset of the set of spiders.\n\n2. **Statement 2: All spiders are grandparents.**\n   - This means that every member of the category \"spiders\" is also a member of the category \"grandparents.\"\n   - In logical terms, the set of spiders is a subset of the set of grandparents.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion:\n\n- **Conclusion: All grandparents are spiders.**\n  - This would mean that every member of the category \"grandparents\" is also a member of the category \"spiders.\"\n  - In logical terms, this would imply that the set of grandparents is a subset of the set of spiders.\n\n**Logical Analysis:**\n\n- From Statement 1, we know: Elephants ⊆ Spiders\n- From Statement 2, we know: Spiders ⊆ Grandparents\n\nUsing these two statements, we can deduce that:\n- Elephants ⊆ Spiders ⊆ Grandparents\n\nThis means that all elephants are grandparents, but it does not provide any information about whether all grandparents are spiders. The logical relationship only goes in one direction (from elephants to grandparents), and there is no information to support the reverse (from grandparents to spiders).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"All grandparents are spiders\" does not logically follow from the given statements.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe conclusion does not logically follow from the given statements. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
