    "To determine whether the conclusion \"Some whales are students\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - **Statement 1:** \"All whales are artists.\"\n     - This means that every whale is included in the group of artists. In logical terms, the set of whales is a subset of the set of artists.\n   - **Statement 2:** \"Some artists are students.\"\n     - This means that there is at least one artist who is also a student. In logical terms, there is an intersection between the set of artists and the set of students.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Conclusion:**\n   - **Conclusion:** \"Some whales are students.\"\n     - This conclusion suggests that there is at least one whale who is also a student. In logical terms, it suggests an intersection between the set of whales and the set of students.\n\n3. **Logical Deduction:**\n   - From Statement 1, we know that all whales are artists. Therefore, the set of whales is entirely contained within the set of artists.\n   - From Statement 2, we know that there is some overlap between the set of artists and the set of students.\n   - However, the overlap between artists and students does not necessarily include any whales. The overlap could be entirely within the portion of the artist set that does not include whales.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The information given does not guarantee that any of the whales are part of the overlap between artists and students. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that some whales are students based solely on the given statements.\n\n### Final Answer:\nBased on the analysis, the conclusion \"Some whales are students\" does not logically follow from the given statements.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<No>>>."
