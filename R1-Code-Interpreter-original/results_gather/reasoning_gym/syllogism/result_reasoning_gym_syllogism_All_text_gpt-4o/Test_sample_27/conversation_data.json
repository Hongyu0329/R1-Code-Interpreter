    "To determine whether the conclusion \"No spiders are grandparents\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the statements step by step.\n\n1. **Statement 1: Some programmers are grandparents.**\n   - This means there is at least one person who is both a programmer and a grandparent.\n\n2. **Statement 2: All grandparents are spiders.**\n   - This means every grandparent is also a spider.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion:\n\n- **Conclusion: No spiders are grandparents.**\n  - This statement suggests that there is no individual who is both a spider and a grandparent.\n\nLet's evaluate the logical consistency:\n\n- From Statement 2, we know that all grandparents are spiders. This directly contradicts the conclusion that no spiders are grandparents. If all grandparents are spiders, then it is impossible for no spiders to be grandparents.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"No spiders are grandparents\" does not logically follow from the given statements.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<No>>>."
