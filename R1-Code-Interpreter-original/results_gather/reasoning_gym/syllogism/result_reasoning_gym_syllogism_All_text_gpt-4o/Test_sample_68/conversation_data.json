    "To determine whether the conclusion \"Some doctors are artists\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1: All doctors are spiders.**\n   - This means that every individual who is a doctor is also a spider. There are no doctors who are not spiders.\n\n2. **Statement 2: All spiders are artists.**\n   - This means that every individual who is a spider is also an artist. There are no spiders who are not artists.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical implications:\n\n- From Statement 1, we know that if someone is a doctor, then they must be a spider.\n- From Statement 2, we know that if someone is a spider, then they must be an artist.\n\nBy combining these two statements, we can deduce the following:\n\n- If someone is a doctor, then they are a spider (from Statement 1).\n- If someone is a spider, then they are an artist (from Statement 2).\n\nTherefore, if someone is a doctor, they must also be an artist because:\n- Being a doctor implies being a spider (Statement 1).\n- Being a spider implies being an artist (Statement 2).\n\nThus, it logically follows that:\n- All doctors are artists.\n\nSince \"all doctors are artists\" implies that \"some doctors are artists\" (because \"some\" is a subset of \"all\"), the conclusion \"Some doctors are artists\" is logically valid.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
