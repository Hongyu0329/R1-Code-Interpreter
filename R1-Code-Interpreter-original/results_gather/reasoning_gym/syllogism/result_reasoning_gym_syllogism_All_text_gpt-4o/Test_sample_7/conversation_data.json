    "To determine whether the conclusion \"No reptiles are lawyers\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical relationships step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Statement 1: No writers are lawyers.**\n   - This means there is no overlap between the set of writers and the set of lawyers. In a Venn diagram, the circles representing writers and lawyers do not intersect.\n\n2. **Statement 2: Some lawyers are not reptiles.**\n   - This indicates that there is at least one lawyer who is not a reptile. In a Venn diagram, this means that the circle representing lawyers has a portion that does not overlap with the circle representing reptiles.\n\n### Conclusion Analysis:\n\n- **Conclusion: No reptiles are lawyers.**\n  - This would mean that there is no overlap between the set of reptiles and the set of lawyers. In a Venn diagram, the circles representing reptiles and lawyers would not intersect at all.\n\n### Logical Evaluation:\n\n- From Statement 2, we know that some lawyers are not reptiles. This does not provide any information about whether some lawyers could be reptiles. It only tells us that not all lawyers are reptiles.\n- Statement 1 is about the relationship between writers and lawyers, which does not directly affect the relationship between reptiles and lawyers.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\n\n- The given statements do not provide enough information to conclude that no reptiles are lawyers. The fact that some lawyers are not reptiles does not imply that no lawyers are reptiles. Therefore, the conclusion \"No reptiles are lawyers\" does not logically follow from the given statements.\n\nThus, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
