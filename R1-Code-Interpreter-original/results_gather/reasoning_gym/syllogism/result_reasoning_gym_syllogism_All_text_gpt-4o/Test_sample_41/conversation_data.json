    "To determine whether the conclusion \"Some chefs are not lions\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the statements step by step.\n\n1. **Statement 1: Some chefs are students.**\n   - This means there is at least one individual who is both a chef and a student.\n\n2. **Statement 2: All students are lions.**\n   - This means every individual who is a student is also a lion.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical implications:\n\n- From Statement 1, we know there is at least one individual who is both a chef and a student.\n- From Statement 2, since all students are lions, the individual who is both a chef and a student must also be a lion.\n\nTherefore, the individual who is both a chef and a student is also a lion. This means that at least some chefs are lions.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion:\n\n- **Conclusion: Some chefs are not lions.**\n  - For this conclusion to be true, there must be at least one chef who is not a lion.\n\nHowever, based on the analysis of the given statements, we have established that at least some chefs are lions. The statements do not provide any information about chefs who are not students, and therefore, we cannot conclude that there are chefs who are not lions.\n\nThus, the conclusion \"Some chefs are not lions\" does not logically follow from the given statements.\n\nThe answer to the question is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
