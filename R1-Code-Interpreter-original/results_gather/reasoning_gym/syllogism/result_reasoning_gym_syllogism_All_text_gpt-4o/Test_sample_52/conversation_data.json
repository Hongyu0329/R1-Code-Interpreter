    "To determine whether the conclusion \"Some children are animals\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the statements step by step.\n\n1. **Statement 1: Some animals are children.**\n   - This statement indicates that there is at least one entity that is both an animal and a child. It establishes a partial overlap between the categories of \"animals\" and \"children.\"\n\n2. **Statement 2: No children are elephants.**\n   - This statement indicates that there is no overlap between the categories of \"children\" and \"elephants.\" In other words, if something is a child, it cannot be an elephant.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion:\n\n- **Conclusion: Some children are animals.**\n  - This conclusion suggests that there is at least one entity that is both a child and an animal.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- From Statement 1, we know that there is some overlap between \"animals\" and \"children.\" This means that there is at least one entity that is both an animal and a child.\n- Statement 2 does not affect the relationship between \"animals\" and \"children\" directly. It only specifies that children cannot be elephants, which is a subset of animals. However, this does not negate the possibility of children being other types of animals.\n\nSince Statement 1 already establishes that some animals are children, it directly supports the conclusion that some children are animals. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the given statements.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe conclusion \"Some children are animals\" does logically follow from the given statements.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
