    "To determine whether the conclusion \"Some horses are not insects\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the statements step by step.\n\n1. **Statement 1: Some horses are students.**\n   - This means there is at least one horse that is also a student. Let's denote this subset of horses as \"H1\" which are students.\n\n2. **Statement 2: No students are insects.**\n   - This means that if something is a student, it cannot be an insect. Therefore, the subset of horses that are students (H1) cannot be insects.\n\n3. **Conclusion: Some horses are not insects.**\n   - We need to determine if this conclusion logically follows from the above statements.\n   - From Statement 1, we know there is a subset of horses (H1) that are students.\n   - From Statement 2, we know that this subset (H1) cannot be insects because they are students.\n   - Therefore, the horses that are students (H1) are not insects.\n\nSince we have identified a subset of horses (H1) that are not insects, the conclusion \"Some horses are not insects\" logically follows from the given statements.\n\nThus, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
