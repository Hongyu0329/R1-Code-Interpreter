    "To determine whether the conclusion \"Some writers are horses\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements step by step.\n\n1. **Statement 1: All writers are grandparents.**\n   - This means that every individual who is a writer is also a grandparent. There are no writers who are not grandparents.\n\n2. **Statement 2: All grandparents are horses.**\n   - This means that every individual who is a grandparent is also a horse. There are no grandparents who are not horses.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion:\n\n- **Conclusion: Some writers are horses.**\n  - The term \"some\" in logic typically means \"at least one or more, possibly all.\"\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n- From Statement 1, we know that if someone is a writer, then they must be a grandparent.\n- From Statement 2, we know that if someone is a grandparent, then they must be a horse.\n- By combining these two statements, we can deduce that if someone is a writer, then they must be a grandparent, and since all grandparents are horses, they must also be a horse.\n\nTherefore, if all writers are grandparents and all grandparents are horses, it logically follows that all writers are horses. Since \"all writers are horses\" implies \"some writers are horses\" (because \"some\" includes the possibility of \"all\"), the conclusion \"Some writers are horses\" is logically valid.\n\nThus, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
