    "To determine whether the conclusion \"Some chefs are not lions\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements step by step.\n\n1. **Statement 1: All chefs are adults.**\n   - This means that every individual who is a chef is also an adult. In logical terms, if someone is a chef, then they must be an adult.\n\n2. **Statement 2: Some adults are not lions.**\n   - This indicates that there exists at least one adult who is not a lion. It does not specify anything about chefs directly, only about adults in general.\n\n3. **Conclusion: Some chefs are not lions.**\n   - We need to determine if this conclusion logically follows from the two given statements.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n- From Statement 1, we know that all chefs are adults. Therefore, the set of chefs is a subset of the set of adults.\n\n- From Statement 2, we know that there are some adults who are not lions. This means that within the set of all adults, there is at least one individual who is not a lion.\n\n- The conclusion \"Some chefs are not lions\" would require that there is at least one individual in the subset of chefs who is also in the subset of adults that are not lions.\n\n- However, Statement 2 only tells us that some adults are not lions, but it does not specify which adults these are. It is possible that all chefs could be among the adults who are lions, and the adults who are not lions could be non-chefs.\n\n- Therefore, while it is possible that some chefs are not lions, it is not a necessary conclusion based on the given statements. The information provided does not guarantee that any chef is among the adults who are not lions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe conclusion \"Some chefs are not lions\" does not logically follow from the given statements. The statements do not provide enough information to definitively conclude that there is at least one chef who is not a lion.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
