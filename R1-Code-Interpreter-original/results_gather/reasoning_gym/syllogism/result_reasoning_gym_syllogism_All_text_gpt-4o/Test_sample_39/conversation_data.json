    "To determine whether the conclusion \"All lions are dogs\" logically follows from the given statements, let's analyze each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1: No dogs are lions.**\n   - This means that there is no overlap between the set of dogs and the set of lions. In other words, if something is a dog, it cannot be a lion, and vice versa.\n\n2. **Statement 2: No lions are mortals.**\n   - This means that there is no overlap between the set of lions and the set of mortals. In other words, if something is a lion, it cannot be a mortal, and vice versa.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion:\n\n- **Conclusion: All lions are dogs.**\n  - This statement suggests that every member of the set of lions is also a member of the set of dogs.\n\n**Logical Analysis:**\n\n- From Statement 1, we know that no dogs are lions. This implies that the sets of dogs and lions are completely separate. Therefore, it is impossible for all lions to be dogs because they are mutually exclusive sets.\n\n- Statement 2 does not directly impact the relationship between lions and dogs, but it reinforces that lions are a distinct set that does not overlap with mortals.\n\nGiven these analyses, the conclusion \"All lions are dogs\" does not logically follow from the given statements. The statements actually suggest that lions and dogs are separate categories with no overlap.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
