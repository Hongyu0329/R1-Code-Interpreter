    "To determine whether the conclusion \"Some adults are not engineers\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical relationships step by step.\n\n1. **Statement 1: All adults are spiders.**\n   - This means that every adult is included in the category of spiders. In logical terms, the set of adults is a subset of the set of spiders.\n\n2. **Statement 2: Some spiders are not engineers.**\n   - This indicates that there is at least one spider that is not an engineer. In logical terms, there is a non-empty intersection between the set of spiders and the set of non-engineers.\n\n3. **Conclusion: Some adults are not engineers.**\n   - We need to determine if this conclusion logically follows from the above statements.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- From Statement 1, we know that all adults are spiders. Therefore, the set of adults is entirely contained within the set of spiders.\n- From Statement 2, we know that there are some spiders that are not engineers. This means there is a portion of the spider set that does not overlap with the engineer set.\n- Since all adults are spiders, and some spiders are not engineers, it is possible that the adults could be among those spiders that are not engineers. However, it is not guaranteed because the statement \"some spiders are not engineers\" does not specify which spiders are not engineers. It only indicates that there is at least one spider that is not an engineer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The conclusion \"Some adults are not engineers\" is not definitively supported by the given statements. While it is possible that some adults are among the spiders that are not engineers, the information provided does not guarantee this. The statements do not provide enough information to conclude that there is a definite overlap between the set of adults and the set of non-engineer spiders.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the given statements.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<No>>>"
