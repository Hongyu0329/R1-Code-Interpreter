    "To determine whether the conclusion \"Some scientists are artists\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1: No engineers are artists.**\n   - This statement tells us that there is no overlap between the group of engineers and the group of artists. In other words, if someone is an engineer, they cannot be an artist.\n\n2. **Statement 2: Some artists are scientists.**\n   - This statement indicates that there is some overlap between the group of artists and the group of scientists. Specifically, there is at least one individual who is both an artist and a scientist.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion:\n\n- **Conclusion: Some scientists are artists.**\n  - This conclusion is asking whether there is an overlap between the group of scientists and the group of artists.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- From Statement 2, we know that there is at least one individual who is both an artist and a scientist. This directly supports the conclusion that \"Some scientists are artists.\"\n\n- Statement 1 does not affect the relationship between scientists and artists. It only tells us about the relationship between engineers and artists, which is not relevant to the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, the conclusion \"Some scientists are artists\" logically follows.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
