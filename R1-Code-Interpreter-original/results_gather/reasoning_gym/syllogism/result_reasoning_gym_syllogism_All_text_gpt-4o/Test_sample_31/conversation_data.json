    "To determine whether the conclusion \"No ants are lawyers\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the statements step by step.\n\n1. **Statement 1: All ants are animals.**\n   - This means that every ant is included in the category of animals. There are no ants that are not animals.\n\n2. **Statement 2: All animals are lawyers.**\n   - This means that every animal is included in the category of lawyers. There are no animals that are not lawyers.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements to see what they imply:\n\n- From Statement 1, we know that all ants are animals.\n- From Statement 2, we know that all animals are lawyers.\n\nBy combining these two statements, we can deduce that:\n\n- Since all ants are animals (from Statement 1), and all animals are lawyers (from Statement 2), it logically follows that all ants are lawyers.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"No ants are lawyers\" does not logically follow from the given statements. In fact, the opposite is true: all ants are lawyers.\n\nThus, the answer to the question is \"No.\"\n\nFinal answer: <<<No>>>"
