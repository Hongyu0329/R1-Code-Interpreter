    "To determine whether the conclusion \"Some grandparents are not doctors\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical relationships step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Statement 1: Some grandparents are musicians.**\n   - This means there is at least one person who is both a grandparent and a musician.\n\n2. **Statement 2: No musicians are doctors.**\n   - This means there is no overlap between the set of musicians and the set of doctors. In other words, if someone is a musician, they cannot be a doctor.\n\n### Logical Deduction:\n\n- From Statement 1, we know that there is at least one person who is both a grandparent and a musician.\n- From Statement 2, we know that this person (who is a musician) cannot be a doctor because no musicians are doctors.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Therefore, the person who is both a grandparent and a musician is not a doctor.\n- This means there is at least one grandparent who is not a doctor.\n\nThus, the conclusion \"Some grandparents are not doctors\" logically follows from the given statements.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe answer to the question is: <<<Yes>>>"
