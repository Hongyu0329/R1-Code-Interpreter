    "To determine whether the conclusion \"No tigers are children\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1: All tigers are chefs.**\n   - This means that every tiger is included in the group of chefs. In other words, the set of tigers is a subset of the set of chefs.\n\n2. **Statement 2: No chefs are children.**\n   - This means that there is no overlap between the set of chefs and the set of children. In other words, the set of chefs and the set of children are mutually exclusive.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion:\n\n- **Conclusion: No tigers are children.**\n  - Since all tigers are chefs (from Statement 1), and no chefs are children (from Statement 2), it logically follows that no tigers can be children. This is because if tigers were children, they would also have to be chefs (since all tigers are chefs), which contradicts Statement 2 that no chefs are children.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"No tigers are children\" logically follows from the given statements.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Yes>>>"
