    "To determine whether the conclusion \"No whales are teachers\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical relationships step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - Statement 1: \"No whales are lions.\" This means there is no overlap between the set of whales and the set of lions.\n   - Statement 2: \"All lions are teachers.\" This means the set of lions is entirely contained within the set of teachers.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Relationships:**\n   - From Statement 1, we know that whales and lions are completely separate groups. There is no intersection between these two groups.\n   - From Statement 2, we know that every member of the lion group is also a member of the teacher group. This means the lion group is a subset of the teacher group.\n\n3. **Evaluating the Conclusion:**\n   - The conclusion \"No whales are teachers\" suggests that there is no overlap between the set of whales and the set of teachers.\n   - However, the information provided does not give us any direct relationship between whales and teachers. The only relationships we have are:\n     - Whales are not lions.\n     - Lions are teachers.\n\n4. **Logical Deduction:**\n   - Since we know that no whales are lions, and all lions are teachers, we cannot directly conclude that no whales are teachers. The set of teachers could potentially include members that are not lions, and without additional information, we cannot determine if whales are part of this non-lion subset of teachers.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The conclusion \"No whales are teachers\" does not logically follow from the given statements. There is no information provided that directly connects whales to teachers, other than through lions, which are a separate group from whales.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
