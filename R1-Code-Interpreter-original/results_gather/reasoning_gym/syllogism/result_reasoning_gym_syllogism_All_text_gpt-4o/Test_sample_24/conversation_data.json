    "To determine whether the conclusion \"Some dolphins are horses\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the statements step by step.\n\n1. **Statement 1: Some dolphins are mortals.**\n   - This means there is at least one dolphin that is a mortal. It does not specify anything about the other dolphins.\n\n2. **Statement 2: All mortals are horses.**\n   - This means every mortal is a horse. There are no mortals that are not horses.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical implications:\n\n- From Statement 1, we know that there is at least one dolphin that is a mortal.\n- From Statement 2, we know that all mortals are horses. Therefore, if a dolphin is a mortal, it must also be a horse because all mortals are horses.\n\nBy combining these two statements, we can conclude that:\n\n- Since some dolphins are mortals (from Statement 1), and all mortals are horses (from Statement 2), it logically follows that some dolphins are horses.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Some dolphins are horses\" does logically follow from the given statements.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Yes>>>"
