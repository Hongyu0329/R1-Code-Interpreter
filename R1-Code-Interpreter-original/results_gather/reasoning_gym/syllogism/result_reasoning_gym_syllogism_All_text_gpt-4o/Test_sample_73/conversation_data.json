    "To determine whether the conclusion \"Some birds are not mortals\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - **Statement 1:** \"Some birds are philosophers.\"\n     - This means there is at least one bird that is also a philosopher.\n   - **Statement 2:** \"No philosophers are mortals.\"\n     - This means that if someone is a philosopher, they cannot be a mortal.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Conclusion:**\n   - **Conclusion:** \"Some birds are not mortals.\"\n     - This suggests that there is at least one bird that is not a mortal.\n\n3. **Logical Deduction:**\n   - From Statement 1, we know there is at least one bird that is a philosopher.\n   - From Statement 2, we know that philosophers cannot be mortals.\n   - Therefore, the bird that is a philosopher cannot be a mortal, because it is a philosopher and philosophers are not mortals.\n\n4. **Conclusion Verification:**\n   - Since we have identified at least one bird (the one that is a philosopher) that is not a mortal, the conclusion \"Some birds are not mortals\" logically follows from the given premises.\n\n### Final Answer:\nBased on the logical deduction, the conclusion is valid.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
