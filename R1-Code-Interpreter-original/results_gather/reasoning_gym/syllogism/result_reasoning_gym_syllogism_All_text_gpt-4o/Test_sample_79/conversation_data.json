    "To determine whether the conclusion \"No elephants are dogs\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical relationships between the categories involved: writers, dogs, and elephants.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Statement 1: Some writers are not dogs.**\n   - This statement tells us that there is at least one writer who is not a dog. \n   - It does not provide any information about the relationship between writers and elephants or between writers and other dogs.\n\n2. **Statement 2: No dogs are elephants.**\n   - This statement clearly establishes that there is no overlap between the category of dogs and the category of elephants. \n   - In other words, being a dog and being an elephant are mutually exclusive.\n\n### Conclusion Analysis:\n\n- **Conclusion: No elephants are dogs.**\n  - This conclusion is essentially the same as Statement 2, just phrased differently. \n  - Statement 2 already establishes that no dogs are elephants, which logically implies that no elephants are dogs, as the relationship is bidirectional in terms of exclusion.\n\n### Logical Deduction:\n\n- Since Statement 2 directly states that no dogs are elephants, it inherently means that no elephants can be dogs. \n- The conclusion \"No elephants are dogs\" is a direct restatement of the exclusion established in Statement 2.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"No elephants are dogs\" logically follows from the given statements.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<Yes>>>"
