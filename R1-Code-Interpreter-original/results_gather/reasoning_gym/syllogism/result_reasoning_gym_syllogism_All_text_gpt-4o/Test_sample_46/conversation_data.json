    "To determine whether the conclusion \"No musicians are mammals\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the statements step by step.\n\n1. **Statement 1: All musicians are philosophers.**\n   - This means that if someone is a musician, then they are also a philosopher. In logical terms, this can be expressed as: If M (musician), then P (philosopher).\n\n2. **Statement 2: No philosophers are mammals.**\n   - This means that if someone is a philosopher, then they cannot be a mammal. In logical terms, this can be expressed as: If P (philosopher), then not M (mammal).\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion:\n\n- **Conclusion: No musicians are mammals.**\n  - We need to determine if this conclusion logically follows from the two given statements.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n- From Statement 1, we know that all musicians are philosophers. Therefore, if someone is a musician, they must also be a philosopher.\n\n- From Statement 2, we know that no philosophers are mammals. Therefore, if someone is a philosopher, they cannot be a mammal.\n\n- Combining these two statements:\n  - If someone is a musician, they are a philosopher (from Statement 1).\n  - If they are a philosopher, they cannot be a mammal (from Statement 2).\n\n- Therefore, if someone is a musician, they cannot be a mammal. This directly supports the conclusion that no musicians are mammals.\n\nThus, the conclusion \"No musicians are mammals\" logically follows from the given statements.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<Yes>>>"
