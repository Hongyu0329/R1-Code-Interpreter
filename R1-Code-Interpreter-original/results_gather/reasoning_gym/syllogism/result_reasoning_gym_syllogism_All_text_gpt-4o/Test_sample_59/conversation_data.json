    "To determine whether the conclusion \"Some grandparents are not scientists\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Statement 1: All grandparents are artists.**\n   - This means that every individual who is a grandparent is also an artist. \n   - In logical terms, this can be represented as: If G(x) is \"x is a grandparent\" and A(x) is \"x is an artist,\" then for all x, G(x) implies A(x).\n\n2. **Statement 2: Some artists are not scientists.**\n   - This means there exists at least one individual who is an artist and is not a scientist.\n   - In logical terms, this can be represented as: There exists an x such that A(x) and not S(x), where S(x) is \"x is a scientist.\"\n\n### Conclusion Analysis:\n\n- **Conclusion: Some grandparents are not scientists.**\n  - This conclusion suggests that there exists at least one individual who is a grandparent and is not a scientist.\n  - In logical terms, this can be represented as: There exists an x such that G(x) and not S(x).\n\n### Logical Deduction:\n\n- From Statement 1, we know that all grandparents are artists. Therefore, any grandparent is included in the group of artists.\n- From Statement 2, we know that there are some artists who are not scientists. However, this does not necessarily mean that these non-scientist artists are grandparents. They could be artists who are not grandparents.\n- The conclusion \"Some grandparents are not scientists\" would only logically follow if we could specifically identify that the non-scientist artists include at least one grandparent. However, the information provided does not allow us to make this specific connection.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the given statements, we cannot definitively conclude that some grandparents are not scientists. The statements do not provide enough information to establish this conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
