    "To analyze the question, let's break down the given statements and the conclusion:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: No elephants are birds.\n   - This means that there is no overlap between the set of elephants and the set of birds. In other words, the set of elephants and the set of birds are completely separate.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: No birds are students.\n   - This means that there is no overlap between the set of birds and the set of students. The set of birds and the set of students are also completely separate.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion:\n\n- **Conclusion**: No birds are elephants.\n\nTo determine if this conclusion logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the relationships:\n\n- From Statement 1, we know that the set of elephants and the set of birds are completely separate. This directly implies that no bird can be an elephant, as they belong to two distinct and non-overlapping sets.\n\n- Statement 2 is not directly relevant to the conclusion about birds and elephants, as it only discusses the relationship between birds and students.\n\nTherefore, based on Statement 1 alone, we can conclude that the statement \"No birds are elephants\" is true. The conclusion logically follows from the given statements.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<Yes>>>"
