    "To determine whether the conclusion \"Some humans are not horses\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the statements step by step.\n\n1. **Statement 1: No humans are chefs.**\n   - This means there is no overlap between the set of humans and the set of chefs. In a Venn diagram, the circle representing humans and the circle representing chefs do not intersect.\n\n2. **Statement 2: Some chefs are horses.**\n   - This means there is some overlap between the set of chefs and the set of horses. In a Venn diagram, the circle representing chefs and the circle representing horses intersect.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion:\n\n- **Conclusion: Some humans are not horses.**\n  - We need to determine if this conclusion logically follows from the given statements.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- From Statement 1, we know that humans and chefs are completely separate groups. Therefore, no human can be a chef.\n- From Statement 2, we know that there is an overlap between chefs and horses, meaning some chefs are horses.\n- Since no humans are chefs (Statement 1), and some chefs are horses (Statement 2), it is possible that all humans could be horses, or none, or some. The statements do not provide enough information to definitively conclude that some humans are not horses.\n\nThe key point here is that the statements do not provide any direct information about the relationship between humans and horses. The overlap between chefs and horses does not affect the relationship between humans and horses because humans and chefs are completely separate groups.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Some humans are not horses\" does not logically follow from the given statements.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n<<<No>>>"
