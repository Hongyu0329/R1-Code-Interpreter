    "To determine whether the conclusion \"Some whales are not mortals\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - **Statement 1:** \"No whales are mammals.\"\n     - This means that the set of whales and the set of mammals do not overlap. In other words, whales are completely outside the category of mammals.\n\n   - **Statement 2:** \"Some mammals are not mortals.\"\n     - This indicates that there is at least one mammal that does not belong to the category of mortals. However, it does not provide information about all mammals, only that there is at least one exception.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Conclusion:**\n   - **Conclusion:** \"Some whales are not mortals.\"\n     - This statement suggests that there is at least one whale that is not a mortal.\n\n3. **Logical Implications:**\n   - From Statement 1, we know that whales and mammals are completely separate groups. Therefore, any information about mammals does not directly apply to whales.\n   - Statement 2 provides information about some mammals, but since whales are not mammals (as per Statement 1), this information about mammals does not affect whales.\n\n4. **Evaluating the Conclusion:**\n   - Since whales are not mammals, the fact that some mammals are not mortals does not provide any information about whales.\n   - There is no logical connection between the premises and the conclusion that would allow us to deduce anything about whales being mortals or not.\n\n5. **Final Determination:**\n   - The conclusion \"Some whales are not mortals\" does not logically follow from the given premises. The premises do not provide any information about the mortality of whales.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n<<<No>>>"
