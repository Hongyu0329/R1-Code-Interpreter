    "To determine whether the conclusion \"No animals are whales\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the statements step by step.\n\n1. **Statement 1: All animals are artists.**\n   - This means that every animal is included in the group of artists. In other words, the set of animals is a subset of the set of artists.\n\n2. **Statement 2: No artists are whales.**\n   - This means that there is no overlap between the set of artists and the set of whales. In other words, the set of artists and the set of whales are mutually exclusive.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion:\n\n- **Conclusion: No animals are whales.**\n  - We need to determine if this conclusion logically follows from the two given statements.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n- From Statement 1, we know that all animals are artists. Therefore, every animal is part of the group of artists.\n- From Statement 2, we know that no artists are whales. This means that the group of artists does not include any whales.\n- Since all animals are artists (from Statement 1) and no artists are whales (from Statement 2), it logically follows that no animals can be whales. If an animal were a whale, it would contradict the fact that no artists are whales, given that all animals are artists.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"No animals are whales\" logically follows from the given statements.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Yes>>>."
