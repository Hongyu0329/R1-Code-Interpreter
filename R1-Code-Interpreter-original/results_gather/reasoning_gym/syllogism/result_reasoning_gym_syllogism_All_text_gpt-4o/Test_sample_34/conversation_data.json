    "To determine whether the conclusion \"Some parents are not bees\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the statements step by step.\n\n1. **Statement 1: All parents are mammals.**\n   - This means that every individual that is a parent is also a mammal. There are no parents that are not mammals.\n\n2. **Statement 2: No mammals are bees.**\n   - This means that there is no overlap between the category of mammals and the category of bees. If something is a mammal, it cannot be a bee.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion:\n\n- **Conclusion: Some parents are not bees.**\n  - We need to determine if this conclusion logically follows from the given statements.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n- From Statement 1, we know that all parents are mammals.\n- From Statement 2, we know that no mammals are bees.\n- Therefore, since all parents are mammals and no mammals are bees, it logically follows that no parents can be bees.\n- If no parents can be bees, then it is certainly true that some parents are not bees (in fact, all parents are not bees).\n\nThus, the conclusion \"Some parents are not bees\" logically follows from the given statements.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
