    "To determine whether the conclusion \"Some grandparents are insects\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - **Statement 1:** \"No grandparents are writers.\"\n     - This is a universal negative statement. It means that there is no overlap between the set of grandparents and the set of writers.\n   - **Statement 2:** \"Some writers are insects.\"\n     - This is a particular affirmative statement. It means that there is some overlap between the set of writers and the set of insects.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Conclusion:**\n   - **Conclusion:** \"Some grandparents are insects.\"\n     - This is a particular affirmative statement. It suggests that there is some overlap between the set of grandparents and the set of insects.\n\n3. **Logical Implications:**\n   - From **Statement 1**, we know that the sets of grandparents and writers are completely separate. There is no intersection between these two sets.\n   - From **Statement 2**, we know that there is an intersection between the sets of writers and insects. Some members of the set of writers are also members of the set of insects.\n\n4. **Evaluating the Conclusion:**\n   - The conclusion \"Some grandparents are insects\" would require an intersection between the sets of grandparents and insects.\n   - However, since **Statement 1** tells us that no grandparents are writers, and **Statement 2** only provides information about the relationship between writers and insects, there is no information that directly connects grandparents to insects.\n   - Therefore, there is no logical basis to conclude that there is any overlap between the sets of grandparents and insects.\n\n5. **Final Determination:**\n   - The conclusion \"Some grandparents are insects\" does not logically follow from the given premises. The premises do not provide any information that would allow us to make this connection.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, the conclusion does not logically follow from the given statements.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n<<<No>>>"
