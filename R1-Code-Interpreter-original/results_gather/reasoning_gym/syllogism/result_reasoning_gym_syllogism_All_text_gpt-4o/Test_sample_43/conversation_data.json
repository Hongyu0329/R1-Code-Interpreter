    "To determine whether the conclusion \"Some bees are ants\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the statements step by step.\n\n1. **Statement 1: All ants are bees.**\n   - This means that every ant is also a bee. In other words, the set of ants is entirely contained within the set of bees.\n\n2. **Statement 2: Some bees are spiders.**\n   - This means that there is at least one bee that is also a spider. It does not specify anything about the relationship between ants and spiders.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion:\n\n- **Conclusion: Some bees are ants.**\n  - We need to determine if this conclusion logically follows from the given statements.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n- From Statement 1, we know that all ants are bees. This implies that the set of ants is a subset of the set of bees.\n- Since all ants are bees, it is necessarily true that some bees are ants. Specifically, every ant is a bee, so at least some of the bees must be ants (in fact, all ants are bees).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Some bees are ants\" logically follows from the given statements.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Yes>>>"
