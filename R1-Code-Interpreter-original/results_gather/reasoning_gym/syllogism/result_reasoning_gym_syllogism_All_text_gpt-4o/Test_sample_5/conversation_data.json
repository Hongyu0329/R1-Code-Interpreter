    "To determine whether the conclusion \"Some grandparents are not children\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the statements step by step.\n\n1. **Statement 1: All grandparents are lions.**\n   - This means that every individual who is a grandparent is also a lion. There are no grandparents who are not lions.\n\n2. **Statement 2: No lions are children.**\n   - This means that no individual who is a lion can be a child. Lions and children are mutually exclusive categories.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion:\n\n- **Conclusion: Some grandparents are not children.**\n  - We need to determine if this conclusion logically follows from the given statements.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n- From Statement 1, we know that all grandparents are lions. Therefore, every grandparent falls into the category of lions.\n- From Statement 2, we know that no lions are children. This means that if someone is a lion, they cannot be a child.\n- Since all grandparents are lions (from Statement 1), and no lions are children (from Statement 2), it follows that no grandparents can be children.\n- If no grandparents can be children, then it is certainly true that some grandparents are not children. In fact, all grandparents are not children.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Some grandparents are not children\" logically follows from the given statements.\n\nThe answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
