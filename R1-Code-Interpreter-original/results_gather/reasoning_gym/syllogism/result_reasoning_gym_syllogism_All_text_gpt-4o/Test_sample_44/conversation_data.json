    "To determine whether the conclusion \"No spiders are fish\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1: Some fish are spiders.**\n   - This means there is at least one fish that is also a spider. It establishes an intersection between the set of fish and the set of spiders.\n\n2. **Statement 2: All spiders are reptiles.**\n   - This means every spider is also a reptile. It establishes that the set of spiders is entirely contained within the set of reptiles.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion:\n\n- **Conclusion: No spiders are fish.**\n  - This would mean that there is no overlap between the set of spiders and the set of fish.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n- From Statement 1, we know that there is at least one entity that is both a fish and a spider. This directly contradicts the conclusion that no spiders are fish, as we have already established that some fish are spiders.\n\n- Statement 2 does not affect the relationship between fish and spiders directly. It only tells us that all spiders are also reptiles, but it does not negate the possibility of spiders being fish, as established in Statement 1.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"No spiders are fish\" does not logically follow from the given statements.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<No>>>."
