    "To determine whether the conclusion \"Some adults are grandparents\" logically follows from the given statements, let's analyze each statement and their implications step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1: All adults are chefs.**\n   - This means that every individual who is an adult is also a chef. There are no adults who are not chefs.\n\n2. **Statement 2: Some chefs are not grandparents.**\n   - This indicates that within the group of chefs, there are certain individuals who are not grandparents. However, it does not specify anything about the chefs who are grandparents.\n\nNow, let's analyze whether the conclusion \"Some adults are grandparents\" logically follows:\n\n- From Statement 1, we know that all adults are chefs. Therefore, the set of adults is a subset of the set of chefs.\n- From Statement 2, we know that there are some chefs who are not grandparents. This does not provide any information about whether there are chefs who are grandparents.\n- The conclusion \"Some adults are grandparents\" would require that there is at least one adult who is also a grandparent.\n\nTo determine if this conclusion is valid, consider the following:\n\n- The fact that some chefs are not grandparents does not imply that there are no chefs who are grandparents. It only indicates that not all chefs are grandparents.\n- Since all adults are chefs, it is possible that some of these adults could be among the chefs who are grandparents. However, the statements do not provide any information to confirm or deny this possibility.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot definitively conclude that some adults are grandparents. The information provided is insufficient to make this determination.\n\nThus, the conclusion \"Some adults are grandparents\" does not logically follow from the given statements.\n\nFinal answer: <<<No>>>"
