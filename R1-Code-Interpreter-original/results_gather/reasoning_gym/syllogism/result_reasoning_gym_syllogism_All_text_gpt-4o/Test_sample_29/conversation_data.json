    "To determine whether the conclusion \"Some artists are elephants\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements and the conclusion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Statements:**\n   - Statement 1: \"Some elephants are artists.\"\n     - This means there is at least one elephant that is also an artist.\n   - Statement 2: \"Some artists are dolphins.\"\n     - This means there is at least one artist that is also a dolphin.\n\n2. **Identify the Logical Structure:**\n   - Both statements are of the form \"Some A are B,\" which is a standard form in syllogistic logic.\n   - The statements do not provide a direct link between elephants and dolphins, only between elephants and artists, and artists and dolphins.\n\n3. **Analyze the Conclusion:**\n   - Conclusion: \"Some artists are elephants.\"\n   - This conclusion is asking if there is at least one artist who is also an elephant.\n\n4. **Evaluate the Logical Connection:**\n   - From Statement 1, we know that there is at least one elephant who is an artist.\n   - The conclusion \"Some artists are elephants\" is essentially a restatement of Statement 1, as it implies that there is at least one artist who is also an elephant.\n\n5. **Determine Logical Validity:**\n   - Since Statement 1 directly states that some elephants are artists, it logically follows that some artists are elephants.\n   - The conclusion is directly supported by Statement 1 without needing any additional information from Statement 2.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe conclusion \"Some artists are elephants\" logically follows from the given statements. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
