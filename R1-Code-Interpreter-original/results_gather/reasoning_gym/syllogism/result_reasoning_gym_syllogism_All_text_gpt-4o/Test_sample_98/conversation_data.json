    "To determine whether the conclusion \"No tigers are chefs\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the statements step by step.\n\n1. **Statement 1: All tigers are bees.**\n   - This means that every member of the set of tigers is also a member of the set of bees. In other words, the set of tigers is a subset of the set of bees.\n\n2. **Statement 2: No bees are chefs.**\n   - This means that there is no overlap between the set of bees and the set of chefs. In other words, the set of bees and the set of chefs are mutually exclusive.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion:\n\n- **Conclusion: No tigers are chefs.**\n  - Since all tigers are bees (from Statement 1), and no bees are chefs (from Statement 2), it logically follows that no tigers can be chefs. This is because if tigers were chefs, they would also have to be bees (since all tigers are bees), which contradicts the statement that no bees are chefs.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"No tigers are chefs\" logically follows from the given statements.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Yes>>>"
