    "To determine whether the conclusion \"Some spiders are parents\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - Statement 1: \"All spiders are writers.\" This means that every member of the category \"spiders\" is also a member of the category \"writers.\"\n   - Statement 2: \"All writers are parents.\" This means that every member of the category \"writers\" is also a member of the category \"parents.\"\n\n2. **Logical Deduction:**\n   - From Statement 1, we know that if something is a spider, it must be a writer.\n   - From Statement 2, we know that if something is a writer, it must be a parent.\n   - By combining these two statements, we can deduce that if something is a spider, it must also be a parent. This is because:\n     - All spiders are writers (from Statement 1).\n     - All writers are parents (from Statement 2).\n     - Therefore, all spiders are parents.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The conclusion \"Some spiders are parents\" is asking if there is at least one spider that is a parent.\n   - Since we have deduced that all spiders are parents, it logically follows that some spiders (in fact, all spiders) are parents.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Some spiders are parents\" logically follows from the given statements.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<Yes>>>"
