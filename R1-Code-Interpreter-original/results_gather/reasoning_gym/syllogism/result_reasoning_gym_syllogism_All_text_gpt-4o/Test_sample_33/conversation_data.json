    "To determine whether the conclusion \"Some butterflies are not lions\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the statements step by step.\n\n1. **Statement 1: Some butterflies are animals.**\n   - This means there is at least one butterfly that is also an animal. It does not specify anything about the other butterflies, but it confirms that at least some butterflies belong to the category of animals.\n\n2. **Statement 2: No animals are lions.**\n   - This means there is no overlap between the category of animals and the category of lions. In other words, if something is an animal, it cannot be a lion.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion:\n\n- **Conclusion: Some butterflies are not lions.**\n  - From Statement 1, we know that some butterflies are animals.\n  - From Statement 2, we know that no animals are lions.\n  - Therefore, the butterflies that are animals cannot be lions, because no animals are lions.\n\nThus, it logically follows that the butterflies that are animals are not lions. Since we know that some butterflies are animals, it follows that some butterflies are not lions.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Some butterflies are not lions\" logically follows from the given statements.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Yes>>>"
