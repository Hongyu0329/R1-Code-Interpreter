    "To determine whether the conclusion \"Some parents are not birds\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1: All parents are artists.**\n   - This means that every individual who is a parent is also an artist. There are no parents who are not artists.\n\n2. **Statement 2: No artists are birds.**\n   - This means that if someone is an artist, they cannot be a bird. There is no overlap between the group of artists and the group of birds.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion:\n\n- **Conclusion: Some parents are not birds.**\n  - We need to determine if this conclusion logically follows from the given statements.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n- From Statement 1, we know that all parents are included in the group of artists.\n- From Statement 2, we know that the group of artists and the group of birds do not overlap at all.\n- Therefore, since all parents are artists (from Statement 1), and no artists can be birds (from Statement 2), it follows that no parents can be birds.\n- If no parents can be birds, then it is certainly true that some parents are not birds, because in fact, all parents are not birds.\n\nThus, the conclusion \"Some parents are not birds\" logically follows from the given statements.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<Yes>>>"
