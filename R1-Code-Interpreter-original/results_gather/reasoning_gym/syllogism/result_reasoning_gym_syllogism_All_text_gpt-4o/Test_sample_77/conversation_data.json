    "To determine whether the conclusion \"Some chefs are spiders\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical relationships step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understanding the Statements:**\n   - **Statement 1:** \"No chefs are programmers.\"\n     - This means there is no overlap between the group of chefs and the group of programmers. In a Venn diagram, the circles representing chefs and programmers do not intersect.\n   \n   - **Statement 2:** \"Some programmers are not spiders.\"\n     - This indicates that there is at least one programmer who is not a spider. In a Venn diagram, the circle representing programmers has a part that does not intersect with the circle representing spiders.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Conclusion:**\n   - **Conclusion:** \"Some chefs are spiders.\"\n     - This suggests that there is at least one chef who is also a spider.\n\n3. **Logical Evaluation:**\n   - From Statement 1, we know that chefs and programmers are completely separate groups. Therefore, any information about programmers does not directly affect the group of chefs.\n   - Statement 2 provides information about the relationship between programmers and spiders, but it does not provide any direct information about chefs.\n   - There is no information given about the relationship between chefs and spiders. The statements do not provide any basis to conclude that there is an overlap between chefs and spiders.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since there is no logical connection or overlap established between chefs and spiders based on the given statements, we cannot conclude that \"Some chefs are spiders.\"\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Some chefs are spiders\" does not logically follow from the given statements.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe answer to the question is <<<No>>>."
