    "To determine whether the conclusion \"All butterflies are dolphins\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the statements step by step.\n\n1. **Statement 1: All butterflies are tigers.**\n   - This means that every butterfly is included in the category of tigers. There are no butterflies that are not tigers.\n\n2. **Statement 2: All tigers are dolphins.**\n   - This means that every tiger is included in the category of dolphins. There are no tigers that are not dolphins.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements to see if the conclusion logically follows:\n\n- From Statement 1, we know that all butterflies are tigers. This implies that the set of butterflies is a subset of the set of tigers.\n- From Statement 2, we know that all tigers are dolphins. This implies that the set of tigers is a subset of the set of dolphins.\n\nBy combining these two statements, we can deduce the following:\n\n- Since all butterflies are tigers (Statement 1), and all tigers are dolphins (Statement 2), it logically follows that all butterflies are also dolphins. This is because the set of butterflies is a subset of the set of tigers, which in turn is a subset of the set of dolphins.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"All butterflies are dolphins\" logically follows from the given statements.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Yes>>>"
