    "To determine whether the conclusion \"No doctors are scientists\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the statements step by step.\n\n1. **Statement 1: All doctors are birds.**\n   - This means that every individual who is a doctor is also a bird. In logical terms, the set of doctors is a subset of the set of birds.\n\n2. **Statement 2: No birds are scientists.**\n   - This means that there is no individual who is both a bird and a scientist. In logical terms, the set of birds and the set of scientists are disjoint; they have no elements in common.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion:\n\n- **Conclusion: No doctors are scientists.**\n  - Since all doctors are birds (from Statement 1), and no birds are scientists (from Statement 2), it logically follows that no doctors can be scientists. This is because if a doctor were a scientist, they would also have to be a bird (from Statement 1), which contradicts Statement 2 that no birds are scientists.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"No doctors are scientists\" logically follows from the given statements.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Yes>>>"
