    "To determine whether the conclusion \"Some teachers are not reptiles\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the statements step by step.\n\n1. **Statement 1: Some teachers are grandparents.**\n   - This means there is at least one teacher who is also a grandparent.\n\n2. **Statement 2: No grandparents are reptiles.**\n   - This means that being a grandparent and being a reptile are mutually exclusive categories. In other words, if someone is a grandparent, they cannot be a reptile.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion:\n\n- **Conclusion: Some teachers are not reptiles.**\n  - From Statement 1, we know that there is at least one teacher who is a grandparent.\n  - From Statement 2, we know that no grandparents are reptiles.\n  - Therefore, the teacher who is a grandparent cannot be a reptile.\n\nThus, it logically follows that there is at least one teacher who is not a reptile. Therefore, the conclusion \"Some teachers are not reptiles\" is valid based on the given statements.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Yes>>>"
