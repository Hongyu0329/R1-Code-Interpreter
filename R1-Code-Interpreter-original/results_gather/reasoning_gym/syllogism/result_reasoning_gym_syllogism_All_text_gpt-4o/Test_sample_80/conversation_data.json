    "To determine whether the conclusion \"Some horses are spiders\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Identify the premises:**\n   - Premise 1: All horses are mammals.\n   - Premise 2: Some mammals are spiders.\n\n2. **Understand the logical implications of the premises:**\n   - From Premise 1, \"All horses are mammals,\" we understand that every horse is included in the category of mammals. This means that the set of horses is a subset of the set of mammals.\n   - From Premise 2, \"Some mammals are spiders,\" we understand that there is at least one mammal that is also a spider. This means there is an intersection between the set of mammals and the set of spiders, but it does not specify which mammals are spiders.\n\n3. **Analyze the conclusion:**\n   - The conclusion \"Some horses are spiders\" suggests that there is at least one horse that is also a spider. This would mean there is an intersection between the set of horses and the set of spiders.\n\n4. **Evaluate the logical connection:**\n   - The premises do not provide any direct information about the relationship between horses and spiders. While Premise 2 indicates that some mammals are spiders, it does not specify that these mammals include horses. The set of mammals that are spiders could be entirely separate from the set of horses.\n\n5. **Determine if the conclusion logically follows:**\n   - Since the premises do not establish any direct connection between horses and spiders, the conclusion \"Some horses are spiders\" does not logically follow from the given premises.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
