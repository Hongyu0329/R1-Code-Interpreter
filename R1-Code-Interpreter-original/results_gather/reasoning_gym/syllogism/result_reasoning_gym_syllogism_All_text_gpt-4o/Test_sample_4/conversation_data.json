    "To determine whether the conclusion \"Some cats are not humans\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the statements step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Statement 1: All cats are adults.**\n   - This means that every cat is included in the group of adults. There are no cats that are not adults.\n\n2. **Statement 2: Some adults are not humans.**\n   - This indicates that within the group of adults, there is at least one individual (or more) that is not a human. However, it does not specify which adults are not humans.\n\n### Conclusion Analysis:\n\n- **Conclusion: Some cats are not humans.**\n  - We need to determine if this conclusion logically follows from the two given statements.\n\n### Logical Deduction:\n\n- From Statement 1, we know that all cats are adults. Therefore, the entire set of cats is a subset of the set of adults.\n- From Statement 2, we know that there is a subset of adults that are not humans. However, this statement does not specify which adults are not humans, nor does it specify that these non-human adults include cats.\n- The conclusion \"Some cats are not humans\" would require that at least one cat falls into the subset of adults that are not humans. However, the given statements do not provide enough information to definitively place any cat in the non-human category of adults.\n\n### Final Determination:\n\n- The statements do not provide enough information to conclude that some cats are not humans. The possibility exists, but it is not a logical necessity based on the given information.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Some cats are not humans\" does not logically follow from the given statements.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n<<<No>>>"
