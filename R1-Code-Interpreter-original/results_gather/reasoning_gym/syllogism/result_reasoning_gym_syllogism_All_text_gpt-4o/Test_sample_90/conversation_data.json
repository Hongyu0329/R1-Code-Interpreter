    "To determine whether the conclusion \"Some lions are mammals\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises.\n\n1. **Statement 1: No lions are writers.**\n   - This means that there is no overlap between the set of lions and the set of writers. In other words, if something is a lion, it cannot be a writer.\n\n2. **Statement 2: All writers are mammals.**\n   - This means that the set of writers is entirely contained within the set of mammals. In other words, if something is a writer, it must also be a mammal.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion:\n\n- **Conclusion: Some lions are mammals.**\n  - This conclusion suggests that there is at least one lion that is also a mammal.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n- From Statement 1, we know that lions and writers are completely separate groups. There is no intersection between lions and writers.\n- From Statement 2, we know that all writers are mammals. This means that the set of writers is a subset of the set of mammals.\n- However, the relationship between lions and mammals is not directly addressed by the given statements. The statements do not provide any information about whether lions are mammals or not.\n\n**Logical Deduction:**\n\n- The statements only tell us about the relationship between lions and writers, and writers and mammals. They do not provide any direct information about the relationship between lions and mammals.\n- Therefore, based on the given statements, we cannot logically conclude that some lions are mammals. The statements do not provide enough information to make this conclusion.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe conclusion \"Some lions are mammals\" does not logically follow from the given statements. The statements do not provide sufficient information to establish a direct relationship between lions and mammals.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
