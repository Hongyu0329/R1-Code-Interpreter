    "To determine whether the conclusion \"Some children are writers\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the statements step by step.\n\n1. **Statement 1: Some musicians are not writers.**\n   - This statement tells us that there is at least one musician who is not a writer. It does not provide any information about musicians who might be writers or about writers who might be musicians.\n\n2. **Statement 2: Some writers are children.**\n   - This statement tells us that there is at least one writer who is a child. It establishes a direct relationship between the categories of writers and children.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion:\n\n- **Conclusion: Some children are writers.**\n  - This conclusion is essentially a rephrasing of Statement 2. Statement 2 already tells us that some writers are children, which implies that some children are writers. Therefore, the conclusion directly follows from Statement 2.\n\nIn summary, the conclusion \"Some children are writers\" is directly supported by Statement 2, and no additional information or inference is needed from Statement 1.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
