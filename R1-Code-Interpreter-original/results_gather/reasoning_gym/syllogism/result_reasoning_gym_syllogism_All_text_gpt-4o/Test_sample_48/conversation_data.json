    "To determine whether the conclusion \"Some chefs are not whales\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the statements step by step.\n\n1. **Statement 1: All chefs are insects.**\n   - This means that every individual who is a chef is also an insect. There is no chef who is not an insect.\n\n2. **Statement 2: No insects are whales.**\n   - This means that there is no individual who is both an insect and a whale. In other words, being an insect and being a whale are mutually exclusive categories.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion:\n\n- **Conclusion: Some chefs are not whales.**\n  - From Statement 1, we know that all chefs are insects.\n  - From Statement 2, we know that no insects are whales.\n  - Therefore, since all chefs are insects and no insects are whales, it logically follows that no chefs can be whales.\n  - If no chefs are whales, then it is certainly true that some chefs are not whales (in fact, all chefs are not whales).\n\nThus, the conclusion \"Some chefs are not whales\" logically follows from the given statements.\n\nFinal answer: <<<Yes>>>"
