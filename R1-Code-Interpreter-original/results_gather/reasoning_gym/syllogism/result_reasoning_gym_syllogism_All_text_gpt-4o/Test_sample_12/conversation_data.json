    "To determine whether the conclusion \"Some butterflies are whales\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical relationships step by step.\n\n1. **Statement 1: Some butterflies are not tigers.**\n   - This statement tells us that there is at least one butterfly that is not a tiger. It does not provide any information about the relationship between butterflies and whales.\n\n2. **Statement 2: No tigers are whales.**\n   - This statement tells us that there is no overlap between the set of tigers and the set of whales. In other words, tigers and whales are completely separate groups.\n\nNow, let's analyze the conclusion:\n\n- **Conclusion: Some butterflies are whales.**\n  - For this conclusion to be true, there must be at least one butterfly that is also a whale.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- From Statement 1, we know that some butterflies are not tigers, but this does not provide any information about whether those butterflies are whales or not.\n- From Statement 2, we know that tigers and whales are completely separate groups, but this does not provide any information about the relationship between butterflies and whales.\n\nThe given statements do not provide any direct or indirect information that connects butterflies to whales. Therefore, there is no logical basis to conclude that some butterflies are whales based on the given statements.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe conclusion \"Some butterflies are whales\" does not logically follow from the given statements.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<No>>>"
