    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements and determine if the conclusion logically follows.\n\n1. All doctors are birds.\n   - This means that every individual who is a doctor is also a bird.\n\n2. No birds are scientists.\n   - This means that no individual who is a bird can be a scientist.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion:\n- No doctors are scientists.\n\nTo determine if this conclusion logically follows, we can use the transitive property of logic:\n\n- From statement 1, we know that if someone is a doctor, then they are a bird.\n- From statement 2, we know that if someone is a bird, then they cannot be a scientist.\n\nTherefore, if someone is a doctor, they must be a bird, and since no birds are scientists, it logically follows that no doctors can be scientists.\n\nThus, the conclusion \"No doctors are scientists\" logically follows from the given statements.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Consider these statements:\n1.
