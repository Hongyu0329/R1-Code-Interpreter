    "To determine whether the conclusion \"All doctors are birds\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical relationships between the categories involved: doctors, ants, and birds.\n\nLet's break down the given statements:\n\n1. Some doctors are not ants: This means there is at least one doctor who is not an ant. However, it does not provide any information about the relationship between doctors and birds.\n\n2. No ants are birds: This means that there is no overlap between the categories of ants and birds.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion:\n\n- All doctors are birds: This would mean that every individual in the category of doctors is also in the category of birds.\n\nTo determine if this conclusion logically follows, we need to see if the given statements provide enough information to establish that all doctors are birds.\n\n- From statement 1, we know that some doctors are not ants, but this does not imply anything about their relationship with birds.\n- From statement 2, we know that ants and birds are mutually exclusive categories, but this does not provide any direct information about doctors being birds.\n\nSince the given statements do not provide any direct or indirect information that all doctors are birds, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<No>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Consider these statements:\n1.
