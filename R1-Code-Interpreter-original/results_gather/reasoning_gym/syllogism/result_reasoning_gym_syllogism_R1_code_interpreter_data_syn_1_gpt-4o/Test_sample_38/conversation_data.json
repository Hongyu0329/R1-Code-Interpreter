    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements and determine if the conclusion logically follows from them.\n\n1. All students are animals: This means that every student is included in the category of animals.\n\n2. No animals are spiders: This means that the category of animals and the category of spiders do not overlap at all.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion:\n\n- No students are spiders: This would mean that the category of students and the category of spiders do not overlap.\n\nGiven the statements:\n\n- Since all students are animals, and no animals are spiders, it logically follows that no students can be spiders. This is because students, being a subset of animals, cannot be part of the category of spiders, as animals and spiders are mutually exclusive categories.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"No students are spiders\" logically follows from the given statements.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Consider these statements:\n1.
