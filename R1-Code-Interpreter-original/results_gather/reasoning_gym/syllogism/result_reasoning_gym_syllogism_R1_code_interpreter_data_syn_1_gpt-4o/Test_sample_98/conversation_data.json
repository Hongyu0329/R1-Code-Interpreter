    "To determine whether the conclusion \"No tigers are chefs\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical relationships between the categories involved.\n\nLet's break down the statements:\n\n1. All tigers are bees: This means that every member of the category \"tigers\" is also a member of the category \"bees.\"\n\n2. No bees are chefs: This means that there is no overlap between the category \"bees\" and the category \"chefs.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion:\n\n- No tigers are chefs: This would mean that there is no overlap between the category \"tigers\" and the category \"chefs.\"\n\nGiven the statements:\n\n- Since all tigers are bees, and no bees are chefs, it logically follows that no tigers can be chefs. This is because if tigers were chefs, then bees would also have to be chefs, which contradicts the second statement.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"No tigers are chefs\" logically follows from the given statements.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Consider these statements:\n1.
