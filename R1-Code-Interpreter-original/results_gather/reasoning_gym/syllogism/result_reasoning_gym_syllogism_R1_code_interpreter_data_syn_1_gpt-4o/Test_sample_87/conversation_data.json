    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements and determine if the conclusion logically follows.\n\n1. All animals are artists.\n   - This means that every animal is included in the group of artists.\n\n2. No artists are whales.\n   - This means that the group of artists and the group of whales do not overlap at all.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion:\n\n- No animals are whales.\n\nTo determine if this conclusion logically follows, we can use the transitive property of logic:\n\n- Since all animals are artists (from statement 1), and no artists are whales (from statement 2), it logically follows that no animals can be whales. This is because if an animal were a whale, it would have to be an artist (from statement 1), but no artists are whales (from statement 2), creating a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"No animals are whales\" logically follows from the given statements.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Consider these statements:\n1.
