    "To determine whether the conclusion \"Some whales are not mortals\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\nLet's break down the statements:\n\n1. \"No whales are mammals\" - This means that the set of whales and the set of mammals are completely disjoint. There is no overlap between whales and mammals.\n\n2. \"Some mammals are not mortals\" - This means that there is at least one mammal that is not a mortal. However, it does not provide any information about the mortality of non-mammals.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion:\n\n- \"Some whales are not mortals\" - This statement suggests that there is at least one whale that is not a mortal.\n\nTo determine if the conclusion follows logically, we need to consider the relationships:\n\n- Since no whales are mammals, the statement about mammals not being mortals does not directly apply to whales. The mortality status of whales is not addressed by the premises.\n\n- The premises do not provide any information about the mortality of whales. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude anything about the mortality of whales based on the given premises.\n\nThus, the conclusion \"Some whales are not mortals\" does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<No>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Consider these statements:\n1.
