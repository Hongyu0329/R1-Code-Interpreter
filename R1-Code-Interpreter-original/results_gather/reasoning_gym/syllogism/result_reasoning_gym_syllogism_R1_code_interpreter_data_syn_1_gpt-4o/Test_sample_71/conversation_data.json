    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical statements and determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. All spiders are writers.\n2. All writers are parents.\n\nWe need to determine if it logically follows that some spiders are parents.\n\nLet's break down the statements:\n\n- The first statement, \"All spiders are writers,\" means that every spider is included in the group of writers.\n- The second statement, \"All writers are parents,\" means that every writer is included in the group of parents.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can deduce the following:\n\n- Since all spiders are writers, and all writers are parents, it follows that all spiders are also parents. This is because the group of spiders is a subset of the group of writers, which is itself a subset of the group of parents.\n\nTherefore, it logically follows that some spiders are parents, as \"some\" is a subset of \"all.\"\n\nThe conclusion is that the statement \"Some spiders are parents\" is true based on the given premises.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Consider these statements:\n1.
