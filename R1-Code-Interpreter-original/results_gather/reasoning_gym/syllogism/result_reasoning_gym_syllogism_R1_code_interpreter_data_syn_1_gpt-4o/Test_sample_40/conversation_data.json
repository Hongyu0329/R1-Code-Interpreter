    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements and determine if the conclusion logically follows.\n\n1. All parents are artists.\n   - This means every individual who is a parent is also an artist.\n\n2. No artists are birds.\n   - This means there is no overlap between the group of artists and the group of birds.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion:\n- Some parents are not birds.\n\nTo determine if this conclusion is valid, we can use the information from the statements:\n\n- Since all parents are artists (from statement 1), and no artists are birds (from statement 2), it follows that no parents can be birds. This is because if a parent were a bird, they would also have to be an artist, which contradicts statement 2.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Some parents are not birds\" is logically valid because, in fact, no parents are birds.\n\nThus, the answer to the question is \"Yes.\"\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
