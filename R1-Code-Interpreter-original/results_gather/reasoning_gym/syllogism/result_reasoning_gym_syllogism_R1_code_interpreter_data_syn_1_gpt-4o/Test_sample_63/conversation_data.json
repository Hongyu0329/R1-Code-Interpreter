    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements and determine if the conclusion logically follows.\n\n1. No whales are lions.\n2. All lions are teachers.\n\nWe need to determine if it logically follows that:\n- No whales are teachers.\n\nLet's break down the statements:\n\n- The first statement, \"No whales are lions,\" tells us that there is no overlap between the set of whales and the set of lions.\n- The second statement, \"All lions are teachers,\" tells us that the set of lions is entirely contained within the set of teachers.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion:\n- \"No whales are teachers.\"\n\nTo determine if this conclusion is valid, we need to consider the relationships:\n- Since no whales are lions, and all lions are teachers, it does not necessarily mean that no whales can be teachers. There could be teachers who are not lions, and whales could potentially be among them.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"No whales are teachers\" does not logically follow from the given statements.\n\nThe answer is <<<No>>>."

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Consider these statements:\n1.
