    "To determine if the conclusion \"Some birds are not mortals\" logically follows from the given premises, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. Some birds are philosophers.\n2. No philosophers are mortals.\n\nWe can break down the logic as follows:\n\n- From statement 1, we know there is at least one bird that is a philosopher.\n- From statement 2, we know that no philosopher is a mortal.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion:\n\n- \"Some birds are not mortals\" suggests that there is at least one bird that is not a mortal.\n\nGiven that some birds are philosophers and no philosophers are mortals, it follows that those birds that are philosophers cannot be mortals. Therefore, it logically follows that some birds (specifically, those that are philosophers) are not mortals.\n\nThus, the conclusion \"Some birds are not mortals\" does logically follow from the premises.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Consider these statements:\n1.
