    "To determine whether the conclusion \"No lions are cats\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises:\n\n1. All lions are spiders.\n2. No spiders are cats.\n\nFrom these premises, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The first statement \"All lions are spiders\" means that if something is a lion, then it is also a spider.\n- The second statement \"No spiders are cats\" means that if something is a spider, then it cannot be a cat.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion \"No lions are cats\":\n\n- If all lions are spiders (from statement 1), and no spiders are cats (from statement 2), then it logically follows that no lions can be cats. This is because being a lion implies being a spider, and being a spider implies not being a cat.\n\nThus, the conclusion \"No lions are cats\" logically follows from the given premises.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Consider these statements:\n1.
