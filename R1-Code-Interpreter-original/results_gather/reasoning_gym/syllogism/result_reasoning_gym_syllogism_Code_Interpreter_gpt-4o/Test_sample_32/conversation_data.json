    "\nassistant > To determine if the conclusion \"Some horses are not insects\" logically follows from the given statements, we can analyze the logical structure:\n\n1. Some horses are students.\n2. No students are insects.\n\nFrom these statements, we can deduce the following:\n\n- Since some horses are students, and no students are insects, it follows that those horses that are students cannot be insects.\n\nTherefore, it logically follows that some horses are not insects.\n\nThe answer is: <<<Yes>>>"
