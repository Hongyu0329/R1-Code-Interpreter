    "\nassistant > To determine if the conclusion \"No elephants are dogs\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises:\n\n1. Some writers are not dogs.\n2. No dogs are elephants.\n\nThe second statement, \"No dogs are elephants,\" directly implies that there is no overlap between the categories of dogs and elephants. This means that no member of the category \"dogs\" can be a member of the category \"elephants.\"\n\nThe conclusion \"No elephants are dogs\" is essentially the same statement as \"No dogs are elephants,\" just phrased differently. Both statements indicate that there is no overlap between the categories of dogs and elephants.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion logically follows from the given premises.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
