    "\nassistant > To determine if the conclusion \"Some parents are not birds\" logically follows from the given statements, let's analyze the statements:\n\n1. All parents are artists.\n2. No artists are birds.\n\nFrom these statements, we can deduce the following:\n\n- Since all parents are artists, every parent is an artist.\n- Since no artists are birds, it means that artists and birds are mutually exclusive categories.\n\nGiven these deductions, we can conclude that:\n\n- Since all parents are artists and no artists are birds, it follows that no parents are birds.\n\nTherefore, it logically follows that some parents are not birds, as in fact, no parents are birds.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
