    "\nassistant > To determine if the conclusion \"Some horses are spiders\" logically follows from the given statements, let's analyze the statements:\n\n1. All horses are mammals: This means that every horse is included in the category of mammals.\n2. Some mammals are spiders: This means that there is at least one mammal that is a spider.\n\nThe conclusion \"Some horses are spiders\" would require that there is at least one horse that is also a spider. However, the information provided does not establish any direct relationship between horses and spiders. The fact that some mammals are spiders does not imply that any of those mammals are horses.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the given statements.\n\nThe answer is: <<<No>>>"
