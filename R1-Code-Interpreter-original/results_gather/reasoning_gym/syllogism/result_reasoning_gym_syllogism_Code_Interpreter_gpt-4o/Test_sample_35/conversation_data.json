    "\nassistant > To determine if the conclusion \"Some parents are not butterflies\" logically follows from the given statements, we can analyze the logical relationships:\n\n1. Some parents are students.\n2. No students are butterflies.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there is at least one individual who is both a parent and a student.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that no individual who is a student can be a butterfly.\n\nGiven these two statements, the individual who is both a parent and a student cannot be a butterfly, because they are a student and no students are butterflies.\n\nTherefore, it logically follows that some parents (specifically, those who are also students) are not butterflies.\n\nThus, the conclusion \"Some parents are not butterflies\" is valid.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
