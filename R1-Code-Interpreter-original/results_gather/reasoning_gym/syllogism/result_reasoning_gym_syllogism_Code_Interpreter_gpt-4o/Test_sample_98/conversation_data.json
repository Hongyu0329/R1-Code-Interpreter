    "\nassistant > To determine if the conclusion \"No tigers are chefs\" logically follows from the given statements, we can analyze the logical structure:\n\n1. All tigers are bees.\n   - This means every tiger is included in the category of bees.\n\n2. No bees are chefs.\n   - This means there is no overlap between the category of bees and the category of chefs.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can deduce:\n\n- Since all tigers are bees, and no bees are chefs, it logically follows that no tigers can be chefs. This is because tigers, being bees, cannot be chefs due to the exclusion of bees from the category of chefs.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"No tigers are chefs\" logically follows from the given statements.\n\nThe answer is: <<<Yes>>>"
