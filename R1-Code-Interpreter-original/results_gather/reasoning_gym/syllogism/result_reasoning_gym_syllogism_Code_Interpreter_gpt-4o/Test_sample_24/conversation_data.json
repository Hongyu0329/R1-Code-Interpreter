    "\nassistant > To determine if the conclusion \"Some dolphins are horses\" logically follows from the given statements, we can analyze the logical structure of the premises:\n\n1. Some dolphins are mortals.\n2. All mortals are horses.\n\nFrom these premises, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The first statement tells us that there is at least one dolphin that is a mortal.\n- The second statement tells us that all mortals are horses.\n\nGiven these two premises, if some dolphins are mortals and all mortals are horses, then it logically follows that some dolphins are horses.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Some dolphins are horses\" does logically follow from the given premises.\n\nThe answer is: <<<Yes>>>"
