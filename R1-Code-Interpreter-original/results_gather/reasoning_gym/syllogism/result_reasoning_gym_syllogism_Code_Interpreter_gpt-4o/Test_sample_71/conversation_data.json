    "\nassistant > To determine if the conclusion \"Some spiders are parents\" logically follows from the given statements, we can analyze the logical structure:\n\n1. All spiders are writers.\n2. All writers are parents.\n\nFrom these statements, we can deduce:\n\n- If all spiders are writers, then every spider is a writer.\n- If all writers are parents, then every writer is a parent.\n\nBy combining these two statements, we can conclude that:\n\n- All spiders, being writers, are also parents.\n\nTherefore, it logically follows that some spiders are parents, as \"all spiders are parents\" implies \"some spiders are parents.\"\n\nThe answer is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
