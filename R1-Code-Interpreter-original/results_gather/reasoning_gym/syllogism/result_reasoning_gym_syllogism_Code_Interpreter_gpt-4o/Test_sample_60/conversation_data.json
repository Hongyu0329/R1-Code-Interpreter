    "\nassistant > To determine if the conclusion logically follows from the given statements, we can analyze the logical structure:\n\n1. All butterflies are tigers.\n2. All tigers are dolphins.\n\nFrom these statements, we can deduce:\n\n- If all butterflies are tigers, then every butterfly is also a tiger.\n- If all tigers are dolphins, then every tiger is also a dolphin.\n\nBy transitive reasoning, if all butterflies are tigers and all tigers are dolphins, then all butterflies must also be dolphins.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"All butterflies are dolphins\" logically follows from the given statements.\n\nThe answer is: <<<Yes>>>"
