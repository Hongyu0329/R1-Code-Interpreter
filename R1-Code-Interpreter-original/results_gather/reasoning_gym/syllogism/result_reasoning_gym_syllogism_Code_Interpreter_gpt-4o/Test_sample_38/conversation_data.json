    "\nassistant > To determine if the conclusion \"No students are spiders\" logically follows from the given statements, we can analyze the logical structure:\n\n1. All students are animals.\n2. No animals are spiders.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that every student is an animal. From statement 2, we know that no animal can be a spider. Therefore, since students are animals and no animals are spiders, it logically follows that no students can be spiders.\n\nThus, the conclusion \"No students are spiders\" is valid.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Yes>>>"
