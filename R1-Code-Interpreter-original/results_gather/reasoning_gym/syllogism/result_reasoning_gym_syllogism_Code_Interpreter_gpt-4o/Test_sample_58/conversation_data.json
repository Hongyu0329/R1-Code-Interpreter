    "\nassistant > To determine if the conclusion \"Some writers are horses\" logically follows from the given statements, we can analyze the logical structure of the statements:\n\n1. All writers are grandparents.\n2. All grandparents are horses.\n\nFrom these statements, we can deduce:\n\n- If all writers are grandparents, then every writer is a grandparent.\n- If all grandparents are horses, then every grandparent is a horse.\n\nBy combining these two statements, we can conclude that all writers are horses. Therefore, it logically follows that some writers are horses, as \"some\" is implied when \"all\" is true.\n\nThus, the conclusion \"Some writers are horses\" logically follows from the given statements.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Yes>>>"
