    "\nassistant > To determine if the conclusion \"Some horses are dolphins\" logically follows from the given statements, we can analyze the logical structure:\n\n1. Some horses are humans.\n2. All humans are dolphins.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there is at least one horse that is a human. \n\nFrom statement 2, we know that all humans are dolphins. \n\nTherefore, the horse that is a human (from statement 1) must also be a dolphin (from statement 2).\n\nThus, it logically follows that some horses are dolphins.\n\nThe answer is: <<<Yes>>>"
