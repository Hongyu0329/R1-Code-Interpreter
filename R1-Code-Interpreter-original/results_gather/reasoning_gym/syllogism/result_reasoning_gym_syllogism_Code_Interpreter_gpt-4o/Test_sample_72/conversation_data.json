    "\nassistant > To determine if the conclusion \"No humans are programmers\" logically follows from the given statements, let's analyze the statements:\n\n1. No humans are musicians.\n2. All musicians are programmers.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the set of humans and the set of musicians are completely separate; there is no overlap between them.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the set of musicians is entirely contained within the set of programmers.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion: \"No humans are programmers.\"\n\n- Since no humans are musicians (statement 1), and all musicians are programmers (statement 2), there is no direct information about the relationship between humans and programmers. The statements do not provide any information that would allow us to conclude that humans cannot be programmers. \n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"No humans are programmers\" does not logically follow from the given statements.\n\nThe answer is: <<<No>>>"
