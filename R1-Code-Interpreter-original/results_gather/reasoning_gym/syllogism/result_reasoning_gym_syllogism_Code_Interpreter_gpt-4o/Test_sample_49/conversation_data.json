    "\nassistant > To determine if the conclusion \"No lions are cats\" logically follows from the given statements, we can analyze the logical structure of the statements:\n\n1. All lions are spiders.\n2. No spiders are cats.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that every lion is a spider. \n\nFrom statement 2, we know that no spider is a cat, meaning spiders and cats are mutually exclusive groups.\n\nSince all lions are spiders (from statement 1), and no spiders are cats (from statement 2), it logically follows that no lions can be cats. \n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"No lions are cats\" is valid.\n\nThe answer is: <<<Yes>>>"
