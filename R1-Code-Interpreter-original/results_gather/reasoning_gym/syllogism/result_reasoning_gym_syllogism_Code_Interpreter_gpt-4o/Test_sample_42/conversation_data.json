    "\nassistant > To determine if the conclusion \"No dogs are students\" logically follows from the given statements, let's analyze the statements:\n\n1. Some lions are students.\n2. No students are dogs.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that there is no overlap between the set of students and the set of dogs. This directly implies that no dogs can be students.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"No dogs are students\" logically follows from the given statements.\n\nThe answer is: <<<Yes>>>"
