    "\nassistant > To determine whether the conclusion \"Some whales are not mortals\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises:\n\n1. No whales are mammals.\n2. Some mammals are not mortals.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- The first statement \"No whales are mammals\" means that the set of whales and the set of mammals are completely separate; there is no overlap between them.\n\n- The second statement \"Some mammals are not mortals\" indicates that there is at least one mammal that is not a mortal.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion \"Some whales are not mortals\":\n\n- Since no whales are mammals (from statement 1), whales are not part of the set of mammals. Therefore, any information about mammals (such as some being non-mortals) does not directly apply to whales.\n\n- The conclusion \"Some whales are not mortals\" would require that there is a subset of whales that are not mortals. However, the premises do not provide any information about the mortality of whales, only about mammals.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Some whales are not mortals\" does not logically follow from the given premises.\n\nThe answer is: <<<No>>>"
