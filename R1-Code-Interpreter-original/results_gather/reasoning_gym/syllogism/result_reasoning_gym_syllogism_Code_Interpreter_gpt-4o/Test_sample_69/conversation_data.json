    "\nassistant > To determine if the conclusion \"Some musicians are not birds\" logically follows from the given statements, let's analyze the statements:\n\n1. All musicians are whales.\n2. Some whales are not birds.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that every musician is a whale. This means the set of musicians is entirely contained within the set of whales.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that there are some whales that are not birds. This means there is at least one whale that is not a bird.\n\nNow, we need to determine if it logically follows that some musicians are not birds. \n\nSince all musicians are whales, and some whales are not birds, it is possible that the musicians who are whales could be among those whales that are not birds. Therefore, it is possible that some musicians are not birds.\n\nThus, the conclusion \"Some musicians are not birds\" logically follows from the given statements.\n\nThe answer is: <<<Yes>>>"
