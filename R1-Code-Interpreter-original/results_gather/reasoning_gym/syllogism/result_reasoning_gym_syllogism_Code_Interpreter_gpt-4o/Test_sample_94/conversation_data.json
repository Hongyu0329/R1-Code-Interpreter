    "\nassistant > To determine if the conclusion \"Some adults are not engineers\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premises:\n\n1. All adults are spiders.\n2. Some spiders are not engineers.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that every adult is a spider. This means that the set of adults is entirely contained within the set of spiders.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that there are some spiders that are not engineers. This means that there is at least one spider that is not an engineer.\n\nNow, we need to determine if it logically follows that some adults are not engineers. Since all adults are spiders, and some spiders are not engineers, it is possible that the non-engineer spiders include some adults. Therefore, it is logically possible that some adults are not engineers.\n\nThus, the conclusion \"Some adults are not engineers\" does logically follow from the given premises.\n\nThe answer is: <<<Yes>>>"
