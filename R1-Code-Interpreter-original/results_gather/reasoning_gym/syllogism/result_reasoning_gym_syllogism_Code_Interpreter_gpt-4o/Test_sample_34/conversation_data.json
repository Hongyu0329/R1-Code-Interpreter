    "\nassistant > To determine if the conclusion \"Some parents are not bees\" logically follows from the given statements, we can analyze the logical structure:\n\n1. All parents are mammals.\n2. No mammals are bees.\n\nFrom these statements, we can deduce the following:\n\n- Since all parents are mammals, every parent is a member of the group \"mammals.\"\n- Since no mammals are bees, it means that there is no overlap between the group \"mammals\" and the group \"bees.\"\n\nGiven these deductions, it logically follows that no parent can be a bee, because all parents are mammals and no mammals are bees.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Some parents are not bees\" is true because, in fact, all parents are not bees.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
