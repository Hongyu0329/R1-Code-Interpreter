    "\nassistant > To determine if the conclusion \"All doctors are birds\" logically follows from the given statements, let's analyze the statements:\n\n1. Some doctors are not ants.\n2. No ants are birds.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there are some doctors who are not ants. This does not provide any information about whether doctors can be birds or not.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that no ants are birds. This means that if something is an ant, it cannot be a bird.\n\nThe conclusion \"All doctors are birds\" would require that every doctor is a bird. However, the given statements do not provide any information that connects doctors to birds. The statements only provide information about the relationship between doctors and ants, and ants and birds.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"All doctors are birds\" does not logically follow from the given statements.\n\nThe answer is: <<<No>>>"
