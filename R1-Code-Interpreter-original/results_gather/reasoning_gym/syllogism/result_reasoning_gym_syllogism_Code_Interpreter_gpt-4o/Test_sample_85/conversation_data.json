    "\nassistant > To determine if the conclusion \"Some scientists are artists\" logically follows from the given statements, we can analyze the statements:\n\n1. No engineers are artists.\n2. Some artists are scientists.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there is no overlap between the group of engineers and the group of artists.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that there is some overlap between the group of artists and the group of scientists, meaning there are some individuals who are both artists and scientists.\n\nThe conclusion \"Some scientists are artists\" is directly supported by statement 2, which explicitly states that some artists are scientists.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion logically follows from the given statements.\n\nThe answer is: <<<Yes>>>"
