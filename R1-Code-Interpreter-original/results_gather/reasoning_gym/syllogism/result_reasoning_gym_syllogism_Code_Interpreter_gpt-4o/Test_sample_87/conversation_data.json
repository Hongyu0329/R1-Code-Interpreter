    "\nassistant > To determine if the conclusion \"No animals are whales\" logically follows from the given statements, we can analyze the logical structure:\n\n1. All animals are artists.\n2. No artists are whales.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that every animal is an artist. \n\nFrom statement 2, we know that no artist can be a whale.\n\nIf all animals are artists and no artist is a whale, it logically follows that no animal can be a whale. \n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"No animals are whales\" is valid.\n\nThe answer is: <<<Yes>>>"
