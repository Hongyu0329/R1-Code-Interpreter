    "\nassistant > To determine if the conclusion logically follows from the given statements, we can use the rules of syllogism.\n\nThe statements are:\n1. All animals are musicians.\n2. All musicians are students.\n\nFrom these statements, we can deduce:\n- If all animals are musicians, then every animal is also a musician.\n- If all musicians are students, then every musician is also a student.\n\nBy combining these two statements, we can conclude that:\n- All animals are students (since all animals are musicians and all musicians are students).\n\nTherefore, it logically follows that some animals are students, as \"some\" is a subset of \"all.\"\n\nThe answer is: <<<Yes>>>"
