    "\nassistant > To determine if the conclusion \"Some birds are not mortals\" logically follows from the given statements, we can analyze the logical structure of the premises:\n\n1. Some birds are philosophers.\n2. No philosophers are mortals.\n\nFrom these premises, we can deduce the following:\n\n- The first statement tells us that there is at least one bird that is a philosopher.\n- The second statement tells us that no philosophers are mortals, meaning all philosophers are non-mortals.\n\nGiven these premises, if some birds are philosophers and no philosophers are mortals, it logically follows that those birds that are philosophers cannot be mortals. Therefore, some birds are not mortals.\n\nThus, the conclusion \"Some birds are not mortals\" logically follows from the given premises.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Yes>>>"
