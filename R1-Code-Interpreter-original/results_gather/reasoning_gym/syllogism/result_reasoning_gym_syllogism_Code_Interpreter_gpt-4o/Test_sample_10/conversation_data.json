    "\nassistant > To determine if the conclusion \"Some chefs are humans\" logically follows from the given statements, let's analyze the statements:\n\n1. No students are humans.\n2. All humans are chefs.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there is no overlap between the set of students and the set of humans.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the set of humans is entirely contained within the set of chefs.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion: \"Some chefs are humans.\"\n\nSince all humans are chefs (from statement 2), it logically follows that there is an overlap between the set of chefs and the set of humans. Therefore, the conclusion \"Some chefs are humans\" is true.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
