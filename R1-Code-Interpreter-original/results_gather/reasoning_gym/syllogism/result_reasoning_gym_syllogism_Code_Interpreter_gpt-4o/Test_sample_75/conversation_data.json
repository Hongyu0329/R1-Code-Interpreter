    "\nassistant > To determine if the conclusion \"Some engineers are horses\" logically follows from the given statements, we can analyze the logical structure:\n\n1. Some engineers are bees.\n2. All bees are horses.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there is at least one engineer who is a bee. \n\nFrom statement 2, we know that all bees are horses. \n\nTherefore, the engineer who is a bee must also be a horse, because all bees are horses.\n\nThus, it logically follows that some engineers are horses.\n\nThe answer is: <<<Yes>>>"
