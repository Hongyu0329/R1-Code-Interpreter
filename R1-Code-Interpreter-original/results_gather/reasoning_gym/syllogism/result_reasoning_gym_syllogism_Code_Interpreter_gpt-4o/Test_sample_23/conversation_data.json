    "\nassistant > To determine if the conclusion \"Some grandparents are not doctors\" logically follows from the given statements, we can analyze the logical relationships:\n\n1. Some grandparents are musicians.\n   - This means there is at least one person who is both a grandparent and a musician.\n\n2. No musicians are doctors.\n   - This means there is no person who is both a musician and a doctor.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer:\n\n- Since some grandparents are musicians, and no musicians are doctors, those grandparents who are musicians cannot be doctors.\n\nTherefore, it logically follows that some grandparents are not doctors.\n\nThe answer is: <<<Yes>>>"
