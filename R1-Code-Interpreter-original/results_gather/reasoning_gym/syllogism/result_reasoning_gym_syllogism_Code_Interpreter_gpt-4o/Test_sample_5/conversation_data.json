    "\nassistant > To determine if the conclusion \"Some grandparents are not children\" logically follows from the given statements, let's analyze the statements:\n\n1. All grandparents are lions.\n2. No lions are children.\n\nFrom these statements, we can deduce the following:\n\n- Since all grandparents are lions, every grandparent is included in the category of lions.\n- Since no lions are children, it follows that no grandparents can be children, because all grandparents are lions.\n\nTherefore, it logically follows that some grandparents (in fact, all grandparents) are not children.\n\nThe conclusion \"Some grandparents are not children\" is logically valid based on the given premises.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
