    "\nassistant > To determine if the conclusion \"Some tigers are not humans\" logically follows from the given statements, let's analyze the statements:\n\n1. All tigers are birds.\n2. Some birds are not humans.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that every tiger is a bird. This means that the set of tigers is entirely contained within the set of birds.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that there are some birds that are not humans. This means that there is at least one bird that is not a human.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion: \"Some tigers are not humans.\"\n\nSince all tigers are birds (from statement 1), and some birds are not humans (from statement 2), it is possible that the tigers could be among those birds that are not humans. Therefore, it logically follows that some tigers are not humans.\n\nThus, the conclusion is valid.\n\nThe answer is: <<<Yes>>>"
