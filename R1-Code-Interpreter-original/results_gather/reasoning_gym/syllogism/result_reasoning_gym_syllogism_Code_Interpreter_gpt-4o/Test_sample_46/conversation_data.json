    "\nassistant > To determine if the conclusion \"No musicians are mammals\" logically follows from the given statements, we can analyze the logical structure of the statements:\n\n1. All musicians are philosophers.\n2. No philosophers are mammals.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that every musician is a philosopher. This can be represented as:\n- If something is a musician, then it is a philosopher.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that no philosopher is a mammal. This can be represented as:\n- If something is a philosopher, then it is not a mammal.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n- If something is a musician, then it is a philosopher (from statement 1).\n- If something is a philosopher, then it is not a mammal (from statement 2).\n\nBy combining these, we can conclude:\n- If something is a musician, then it is not a mammal.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"No musicians are mammals\" logically follows from the given statements.\n\nThe answer is: <<<Yes>>>"
