    "\nassistant > To determine if the conclusion \"Some whales are students\" logically follows from the given statements, we can analyze the logical structure:\n\n1. All whales are artists.\n   - This means every whale is included in the group of artists.\n\n2. Some artists are students.\n   - This means there is at least one artist who is also a student.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion:\n\n- \"Some whales are students\" would mean there is at least one whale who is also a student.\n\nHowever, the information provided does not establish a direct connection between whales and students. While all whales are artists, and some artists are students, it does not necessarily mean that any of those whales are among the artists who are students. \n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Some whales are students\" does not logically follow from the given statements.\n\nThe answer is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
