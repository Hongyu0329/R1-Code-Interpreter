    "\nassistant > To determine if the conclusion \"No birds are elephants\" logically follows from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements:\n\n1. \"No elephants are birds\" means that the set of elephants and the set of birds have no elements in common.\n2. \"No birds are students\" means that the set of birds and the set of students have no elements in common.\n\nThe conclusion \"No birds are elephants\" means that the set of birds and the set of elephants have no elements in common.\n\nThe first statement already establishes that \"No elephants are birds,\" which is logically equivalent to \"No birds are elephants\" due to the symmetric nature of the \"no\" relationship (if no A are B, then no B are A).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"No birds are elephants\" logically follows from the first statement.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
