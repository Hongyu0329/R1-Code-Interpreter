    "\nassistant > To determine if the conclusion \"Some bees are ants\" logically follows from the given statements, let's analyze the statements:\n\n1. All ants are bees: This means every ant is a bee, but not necessarily every bee is an ant.\n\n2. Some bees are spiders: This means there is at least one bee that is also a spider.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion:\n\n- \"Some bees are ants\": Since all ants are bees (from statement 1), it logically follows that there are some bees that are ants (specifically, all ants are included in the category of bees).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Some bees are ants\" does logically follow from the given statements.\n\nThe answer is: <<<Yes>>>"
