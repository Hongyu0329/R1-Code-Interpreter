    "\nassistant > To determine if the conclusion \"No doctors are scientists\" logically follows from the given statements, we can analyze the logical structure:\n\n1. All doctors are birds.\n2. No birds are scientists.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that every doctor is a bird. From statement 2, we know that no bird can be a scientist. Therefore, if all doctors are birds and no birds are scientists, it logically follows that no doctors can be scientists.\n\nThus, the conclusion \"No doctors are scientists\" is valid.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Yes>>>"
