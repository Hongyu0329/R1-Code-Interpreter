    "\nassistant > To determine if the conclusion \"Some cats are not humans\" logically follows from the given statements, let's analyze the statements:\n\n1. All cats are adults.\n2. Some adults are not humans.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that every cat is an adult. \n\nFrom statement 2, we know that there are some adults who are not humans.\n\nNow, combining these two statements:\n\n- Since all cats are adults, and some adults are not humans, it is possible that some of these adults who are not humans could be cats.\n\nTherefore, it logically follows that some cats are not humans.\n\nThe answer is: <<<Yes>>>"
