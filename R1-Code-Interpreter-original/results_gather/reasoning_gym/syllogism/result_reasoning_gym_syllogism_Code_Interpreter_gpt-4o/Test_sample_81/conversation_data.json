    "\nassistant > To determine if the conclusion \"Some humans are not horses\" logically follows from the given statements, let's analyze the statements:\n\n1. No humans are chefs: This means there is no overlap between the set of humans and the set of chefs.\n2. Some chefs are horses: This means there is some overlap between the set of chefs and the set of horses.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion:\n\n- \"Some humans are not horses\": This conclusion suggests that there is at least one human who is not a horse.\n\nGiven that no humans are chefs, and some chefs are horses, there is no direct information about the relationship between humans and horses. The statements do not provide any information that would allow us to conclude anything about the relationship between humans and horses.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Some humans are not horses\" does not logically follow from the given statements.\n\nThe answer is: <<<No>>>"
