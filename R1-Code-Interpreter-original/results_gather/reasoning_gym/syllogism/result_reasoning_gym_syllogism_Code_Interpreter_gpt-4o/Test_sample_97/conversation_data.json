    "\nassistant > To determine if the conclusion \"No tigers are children\" logically follows from the given statements, we can analyze the logical structure:\n\n1. All tigers are chefs.\n   - This means every tiger is included in the group of chefs.\n\n2. No chefs are children.\n   - This means there is no overlap between the group of chefs and the group of children.\n\nFrom these two statements, we can deduce:\n\n- Since all tigers are chefs, and no chefs are children, it logically follows that no tigers can be children. This is because if a tiger were a child, it would contradict the statement that no chefs are children.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"No tigers are children\" logically follows from the given statements.\n\nThe answer is: <<<Yes>>>"
