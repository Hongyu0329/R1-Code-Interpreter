    "\nassistant > To determine if the conclusion \"Some chefs are not whales\" logically follows from the given statements, let's analyze the statements:\n\n1. All chefs are insects.\n2. No insects are whales.\n\nFrom these statements, we can deduce the following:\n\n- Since all chefs are insects, and no insects are whales, it follows that no chefs can be whales. \n\nTherefore, it logically follows that some chefs are not whales (in fact, all chefs are not whales).\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
