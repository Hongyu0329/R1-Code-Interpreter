    "\nassistant > To determine if the conclusion \"No spiders are grandparents\" logically follows from the given statements, let's analyze the statements:\n\n1. Some programmers are grandparents.\n2. All grandparents are spiders.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that all grandparents are included in the category of spiders. Therefore, it is not possible for there to be any grandparents who are not spiders.\n\nThe conclusion \"No spiders are grandparents\" contradicts statement 2, which states that all grandparents are spiders. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the given statements.\n\nThe answer is:\n\n<<<No>>>"
