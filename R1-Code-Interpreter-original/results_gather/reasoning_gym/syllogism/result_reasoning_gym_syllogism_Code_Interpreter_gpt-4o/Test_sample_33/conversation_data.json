    "\nassistant > To determine if the conclusion \"Some butterflies are not lions\" logically follows from the given statements, we can analyze the logical structure:\n\n1. Some butterflies are animals.\n2. No animals are lions.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there is at least one butterfly that is an animal. \n\nFrom statement 2, we know that no animals can be lions. \n\nTherefore, any butterfly that is an animal cannot be a lion, because no animals are lions. \n\nThus, it logically follows that some butterflies (specifically, those that are animals) are not lions.\n\nThe conclusion is valid.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
