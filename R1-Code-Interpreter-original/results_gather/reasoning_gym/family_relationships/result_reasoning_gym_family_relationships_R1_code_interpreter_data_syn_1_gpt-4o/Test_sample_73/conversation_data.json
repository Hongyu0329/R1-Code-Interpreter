    "To determine the relationship between Richard and Ava, we need to analyze the family tree based on the given information:\n\n1. Jack and Aurora are married and have a child named Alexander.\n2. Alexander is married to Nova, and they have two children: Ava and Lisa.\n3. Richard is married to Mary, and they have a child named Nova.\n\nFrom this information, we can deduce the following relationships:\n\n- Nova is the daughter of Richard and Mary.\n- Nova is married to Alexander, making her the mother of Ava and Lisa.\n- Therefore, Richard, being Nova's father, is Ava's grandfather.\n\nThus, Richard is Ava's grandfather. \n\nThe relationship in one word is \"grandfather.\"\n\n<<<grandfather>>>"
