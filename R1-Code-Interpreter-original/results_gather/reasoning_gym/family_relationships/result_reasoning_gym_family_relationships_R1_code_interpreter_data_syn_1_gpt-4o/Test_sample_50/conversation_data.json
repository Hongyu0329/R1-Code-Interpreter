    "To determine the relationship between Lisa and Theodore, we need to analyze the family tree based on the given information:\n\n1. Theodore is married to Zoe.\n2. They have a child called Henry.\n3. Henry is married to Lisa.\n4. Henry and Lisa have a child called Edward.\n\nFrom this information, we can deduce the following relationships:\n- Theodore is Henry's father.\n- Henry is married to Lisa, making Lisa Henry's wife.\n- Since Theodore is Henry's father, Lisa, being Henry's wife, is Theodore's daughter-in-law.\n\nTherefore, the relationship between Lisa and Theodore is that of a daughter-in-law.\n\n<<<daughter-in-law>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Theodore is married to Zoe.
