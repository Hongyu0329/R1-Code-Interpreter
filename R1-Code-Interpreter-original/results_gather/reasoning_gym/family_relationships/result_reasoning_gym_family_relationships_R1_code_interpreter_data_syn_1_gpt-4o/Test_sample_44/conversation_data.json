    "To determine the relationship between Ava and Eleanor, we need to analyze the family tree based on the given information:\n\n1. Logan is married to Eleanor.\n2. They have a child called Matthew.\n3. Matthew is married to Ava.\n4. Matthew and Ava have children called Lucas and Mia.\n\nFrom this information, we can deduce the following relationships:\n- Eleanor is Matthew's mother.\n- Ava is married to Matthew, making her Matthew's wife.\n- Since Eleanor is Matthew's mother, Ava, being Matthew's wife, is Eleanor's daughter-in-law.\n\nTherefore, the relationship between Ava and Eleanor is that of a daughter-in-law.\n\n<<<daughter-in-law>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Logan is married to Eleanor.
