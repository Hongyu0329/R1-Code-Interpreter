    "To determine the relationship between Thomas and Andrew, we need to analyze the family tree based on the given information:\n\n1. Logan and Barbara are married and have a child named Robert.\n2. Robert is married to Linda, and they have a child named Andrew.\n3. Thomas is married to Grace, and they have a child named Linda.\n\nFrom this information, we can deduce the following relationships:\n- Robert is Andrew's father.\n- Linda, who is married to Robert, is Andrew's mother.\n- Thomas and Grace are Linda's parents, making Linda their daughter.\n\nTherefore, Thomas is Andrew's maternal grandfather.\n\nLet's confirm this by organizing the family tree:\n\n- Logan + Barbara\n  - Child: Robert\n    - Married to: Linda (daughter of Thomas and Grace)\n      - Child: Andrew\n\n- Thomas + Grace\n  - Child: Linda\n    - Married to: Robert\n      - Child: Andrew\n\nThus, Thomas is Andrew's grandfather.\n\n<<<grandfather>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Logan is married to Barbara.
