    "To determine the relationship between Alice and Charlotte, we need to trace the family connections described in the problem.\n\n1. Liam and Isabella are married and have a child named Finn.\n2. Finn is married to Victoria, and they have two children: Charlotte and Charles.\n3. Robert is married to Alice, and they have a child named Victoria.\n\nFrom this information, we can deduce the following:\n- Victoria, who is married to Finn, is the daughter of Robert and Alice.\n- Therefore, Alice is Victoria's mother.\n- Since Victoria is Charlotte's mother, Alice is Charlotte's grandmother.\n\nThus, Alice is Charlotte's grandmother.\n\n<<<grandmother>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Liam is married to Isabella.
