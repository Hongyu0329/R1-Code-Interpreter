    "To determine the relationship between Lily and William, we need to analyze the family tree based on the given information:\n\n1. William is married to Lucy.\n2. They have a child named Jayden.\n3. Jayden is married to Lily.\n4. Jayden and Lily have children named Sophia and Rain.\n\nFrom this information, we can deduce the following relationships:\n- William is Jayden's father.\n- Jayden is married to Lily, making Lily Jayden's wife.\n- Since William is Jayden's father, Lily, being Jayden's wife, is William's daughter-in-law.\n\nTherefore, the relationship between Lily and William is that of a daughter-in-law.\n\n<<<daughter-in-law>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    William is married to Lucy.
