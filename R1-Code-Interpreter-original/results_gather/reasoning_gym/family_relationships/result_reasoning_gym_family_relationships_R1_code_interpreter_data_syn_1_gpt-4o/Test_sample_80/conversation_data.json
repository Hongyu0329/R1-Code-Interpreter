    "To determine the relationship between Logan and Ava, we need to analyze the family tree based on the given information:\n\n1. Finn is married to Aurora. They have a child called Logan.\n2. Logan is married to Lucy. They have a child called Harry.\n3. Atlas is married to Ava. They have a child called Lucy.\n\nFrom this information, we can deduce the following relationships:\n\n- Finn and Aurora are Logan's parents.\n- Logan is married to Lucy, making Lucy his wife.\n- Harry is the child of Logan and Lucy, making Harry their son.\n- Atlas and Ava are Lucy's parents, making them Lucy's father and mother, respectively.\n\nNow, we need to determine the relationship between Logan and Ava:\n\n- Since Ava is Lucy's mother, and Lucy is Logan's wife, Ava is Logan's mother-in-law.\n\nTherefore, the relationship between Logan and Ava is that of a son-in-law to a mother-in-law.\n\n<<<mother-in-law>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Finn is married to Aurora.
