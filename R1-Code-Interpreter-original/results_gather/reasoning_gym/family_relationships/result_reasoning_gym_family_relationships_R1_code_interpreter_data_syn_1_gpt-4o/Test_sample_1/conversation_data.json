    "To determine the relationship between Finn and Sophie, we need to analyze the family tree based on the information provided:\n\n1. Peter and Winter are married and have a child named Owen.\n2. Owen is married to Aria.\n3. Owen and Aria have two children: Finn and Sophie.\n4. George and Isabella are married and have a child named Aria.\n\nFrom this information, we can construct the following family tree:\n\n- Peter + Winter\n  - Owen\n    - Owen + Aria\n      - Finn\n      - Sophie\n- George + Isabella\n  - Aria\n\nNow, let's focus on the relationship between Finn and Sophie:\n\n- Both Finn and Sophie are children of Owen and Aria.\n- This makes Finn and Sophie siblings.\n\nTherefore, the relationship between Finn and Sophie is that they are siblings.\n\n<<<siblings>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Peter is married to Winter.
