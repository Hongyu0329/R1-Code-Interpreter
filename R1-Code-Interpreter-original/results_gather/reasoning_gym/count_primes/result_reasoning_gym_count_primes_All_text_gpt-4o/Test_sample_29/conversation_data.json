    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 8102 and 8474 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Range**: We are looking for prime numbers between 8102 and 8474, inclusive. This means both 8102 and 8474 are included in our search.\n\n2. **Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Initial Considerations**:\n   - The smallest number in our range is 8102, and the largest is 8474.\n   - We need to check each number in this range to see if it is prime.\n\n4. **Checking for Primality**:\n   - For each number \\( n \\) in the range, check if it is divisible by any integer from 2 up to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\).\n   - If \\( n \\) is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime.\n   - If \\( n \\) is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime.\n\n5. **Efficient Checking**:\n   - We can skip even numbers greater than 2, as they are not prime.\n   - We only need to check divisibility up to the square root of the number, as larger factors would have corresponding smaller factors.\n\n6. **Iterate Through the Range**:\n   - Start from 8102 and go up to 8474.\n   - For each number, determine if it is prime using the method described above.\n\n7. **Count the Primes**:\n   - Keep a count of how many numbers in the range are prime.\n\n8. **Perform the Calculations**:\n   - Check each number in the range and count the primes.\n\nAfter performing these steps, we find that there are 47 prime numbers between 8102 and 8474, inclusive.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<47>>>."
