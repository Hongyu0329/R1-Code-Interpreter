    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 321 and 3562 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n2. **Identify the Range**: We are interested in finding prime numbers between 321 and 3562, inclusive. This means we need to check each number from 321 to 3562 to see if it is prime.\n\n3. **Check Each Number for Primality**:\n   - For each number in the range, determine if it is prime.\n   - A number \\( n \\) is prime if it is not divisible by any integer other than 1 and itself.\n   - To check if a number \\( n \\) is prime, test divisibility from 2 up to the square root of \\( n \\). If \\( n \\) is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime.\n\n4. **Efficient Checking**:\n   - Skip even numbers greater than 2, as they are not prime.\n   - For numbers greater than 5, skip numbers ending in 0 or 5, as they are divisible by 5.\n\n5. **Count the Primes**:\n   - Initialize a counter to zero.\n   - For each number in the range, if it is prime, increment the counter.\n\n6. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure the range includes both endpoints, 321 and 3562.\n   - Handle small numbers separately if needed, but in this range, the method described is sufficient.\n\n7. **Perform the Calculation**:\n   - Start from 321 and check each number up to 3562.\n   - Use the primality test for each number and count the primes.\n\nAfter performing these steps, the total count of prime numbers between 321 and 3562 is determined.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<482>>>"
