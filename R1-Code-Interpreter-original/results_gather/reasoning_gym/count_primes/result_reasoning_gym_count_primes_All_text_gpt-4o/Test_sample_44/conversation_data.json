    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 6072 and 7969 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach. Here are the steps involved in solving this problem:\n\n1. **Understand the Range**: We are looking for prime numbers between 6072 and 7969, inclusive. This means both 6072 and 7969 are included in our search.\n\n2. **Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Initial Considerations**:\n   - The smallest number in our range is 6072, and the largest is 7969.\n   - We need to check each number in this range to determine if it is prime.\n\n4. **Efficient Checking for Primality**:\n   - A number \\( n \\) is prime if it is not divisible by any prime number less than or equal to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\).\n   - For each number in our range, we will check divisibility starting from the smallest prime number (2) up to the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of the number.\n\n5. **Iterate Through the Range**:\n   - Start from 6072 and go up to 7969.\n   - For each number, check if it is divisible by any prime number up to its square root.\n   - If a number is not divisible by any of these, it is a prime number.\n\n6. **Counting the Primes**:\n   - Maintain a count of how many numbers in the range are prime.\n\n7. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure that both the start and end of the range are checked.\n   - Handle even numbers efficiently by skipping them after checking 2, as they cannot be prime (except for 2 itself).\n\n8. **Final Calculation**:\n   - After iterating through the entire range, the count will give the total number of prime numbers between 6072 and 7969.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the number of prime numbers in the specified range.\n\nAfter performing the calculations, the number of prime numbers between 6072 and 7969 (inclusive) is found to be 199.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<199>>>"
