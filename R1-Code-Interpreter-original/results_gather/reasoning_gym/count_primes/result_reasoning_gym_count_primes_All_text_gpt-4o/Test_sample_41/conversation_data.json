    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 4585 and 5586 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Range**: We are looking for prime numbers between 4585 and 5586, inclusive. This means we need to check each number from 4585 to 5586 to see if it is prime.\n\n2. **Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. This means for a number to be prime, it should not be divisible by any other number except 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Checking for Primality**:\n   - For each number in the range, check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.\n   - To optimize, check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number. If a number \\( n \\) is not divisible by any number up to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\), then it is a prime number.\n\n4. **Iterate Through the Range**:\n   - Start from 4585 and go up to 5586.\n   - For each number, check if it is prime using the method described above.\n\n5. **Count the Prime Numbers**:\n   - Maintain a count of how many numbers in the range are prime.\n\n6. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure to handle the smallest numbers in the range correctly, especially since 4585 is not a prime number (it is odd but divisible by 5).\n   - Check the largest number in the range, 5586, which is even and thus not prime.\n\n7. **Perform the Calculations**:\n   - Go through each number, apply the primality test, and count the primes.\n\nAfter performing these steps, we find the number of prime numbers between 4585 and 5586.\n\nThe final count of prime numbers in this range is 68.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<68>>>"
