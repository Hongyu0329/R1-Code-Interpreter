    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 6358 and 9612 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Range**: We are looking for prime numbers between 6358 and 9612, including both endpoints.\n\n2. **Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Initial Considerations**:\n   - The smallest number in our range is 6358, and the largest is 9612.\n   - We need to check each number in this range to see if it is prime.\n\n4. **Checking for Primality**:\n   - A number \\( n \\) is prime if it is not divisible by any prime number less than or equal to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\).\n   - For each number in the range, check divisibility starting from the smallest prime (2) up to the largest integer less than or equal to its square root.\n\n5. **Efficient Checking**:\n   - Skip even numbers greater than 2, as they are not prime.\n   - Use a list of known small prime numbers to check divisibility.\n\n6. **Iterate Through the Range**:\n   - Start from 6358 and go up to 9612.\n   - For each number, determine if it is prime using the method described above.\n\n7. **Count the Primes**:\n   - Maintain a count of how many numbers in the range are prime.\n\n8. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure to include both 6358 and 9612 in the check.\n   - Handle the smallest and largest numbers in the range carefully.\n\n9. **Final Calculation**:\n   - After iterating through the entire range, the count will give the number of prime numbers.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the number of prime numbers between 6358 and 9612.\n\nAfter performing the calculations, the number of prime numbers between 6358 and 9612 (inclusive) is found to be:\n\n<<<241>>>"
