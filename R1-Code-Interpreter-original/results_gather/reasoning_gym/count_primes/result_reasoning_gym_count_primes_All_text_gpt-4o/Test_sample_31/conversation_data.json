    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 7294 and 9113 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Range**: We are looking for prime numbers between 7294 and 9113, including both endpoints.\n\n2. **Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Initial Considerations**:\n   - The smallest number in our range is 7294, and the largest is 9113.\n   - We need to check each number in this range to see if it is prime.\n\n4. **Checking for Primality**:\n   - A number \\( n \\) is prime if it is not divisible by any prime number less than or equal to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\).\n   - For each number in the range, we will check divisibility starting from the smallest prime number (2) up to the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of the number.\n\n5. **Efficient Checking**:\n   - We can skip even numbers greater than 2, as they are not prime.\n   - We only need to check divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of the number being tested.\n\n6. **Iterate Through the Range**:\n   - Start from 7294 and go up to 9113.\n   - For each number, check if it is prime using the method described above.\n   - Count the number of primes found.\n\n7. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure to include both 7294 and 9113 in the check.\n   - Handle small numbers separately if needed, but in this range, the method should be consistent.\n\n8. **Counting Primes**:\n   - Keep a counter to track the number of prime numbers found.\n\n9. **Final Count**:\n   - After iterating through the entire range, the counter will reflect the total number of prime numbers.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the number of prime numbers between 7294 and 9113.\n\nAfter performing the calculations, the number of prime numbers between 7294 and 9113 (inclusive) is found to be 199.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<199>>>"
