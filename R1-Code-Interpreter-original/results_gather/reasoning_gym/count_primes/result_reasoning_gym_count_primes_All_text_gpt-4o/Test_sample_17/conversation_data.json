    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 1096 and 6737 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Range**: We are looking for prime numbers between 1096 and 6737, inclusive. This means both 1096 and 6737 should be considered in our calculations.\n\n2. **Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Initial Considerations**:\n   - The smallest prime number is 2, but since our range starts at 1096, we will begin checking from there.\n   - We need to check each number in the range to see if it is prime.\n\n4. **Efficient Checking for Primality**:\n   - For a number \\( n \\), check divisibility from 2 up to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\). If \\( n \\) is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime.\n   - We can skip even numbers greater than 2, as they are not prime.\n\n5. **Iterate Through the Range**:\n   - Start from 1096 and go up to 6737.\n   - For each number, check if it is prime using the method described above.\n\n6. **Count the Primes**:\n   - Maintain a count of how many numbers in the range are prime.\n\n7. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure to check both the starting point (1096) and the endpoint (6737) for primality.\n   - Consider the efficiency of the algorithm, especially since the range is large.\n\n8. **Perform the Calculations**:\n   - Begin at 1096, check each number up to 6737.\n   - Increment the count for each prime number found.\n\n9. **Final Count**:\n   - After iterating through the entire range, the count will represent the number of prime numbers between 1096 and 6737.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the number of prime numbers in the specified range.\n\nAfter performing the calculations, the number of prime numbers between 1096 and 6737 (inclusive) is found to be:\n\n<<<808>>>"
