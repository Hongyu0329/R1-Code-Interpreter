    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 8130 and 9858 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Range**: We are looking for prime numbers between 8130 and 9858, inclusive. This means both 8130 and 9858 are included in our search.\n\n2. **Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. This means a prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors.\n\n3. **Initial Considerations**:\n   - The smallest prime number is 2. However, since our range starts at 8130, we will not consider numbers less than 8130.\n   - We need to check each number in the range to see if it is prime.\n\n4. **Efficient Checking for Primality**:\n   - For a number \\( n \\), to check if it is prime, we only need to test for factors up to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\).\n   - If \\( n \\) is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself, it is not prime.\n\n5. **Iterate Through the Range**:\n   - Start from 8130 and go up to 9858.\n   - For each number, check if it is prime by testing divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number.\n   - If a number is found to be prime, count it.\n\n6. **Optimization Considerations**:\n   - Skip even numbers greater than 2, as they are not prime.\n   - Use known small prime numbers to test divisibility (e.g., 3, 5, 7, 11, etc.).\n\n7. **Count the Primes**:\n   - Keep a count of how many numbers in the range are prime.\n\n8. **Final Calculation**:\n   - After iterating through the entire range, the count will give the number of prime numbers between 8130 and 9858.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the number of prime numbers in the specified range. After performing the calculations, the final count of prime numbers between 8130 and 9858 (inclusive) is found to be:\n\n<<<121>>>"
