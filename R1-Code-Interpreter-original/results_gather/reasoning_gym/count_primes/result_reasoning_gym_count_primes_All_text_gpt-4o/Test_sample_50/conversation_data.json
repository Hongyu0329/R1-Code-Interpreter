    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 2372 and 8674 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Range**: We are looking for prime numbers between 2372 and 8674, inclusive. This means both 2372 and 8674 should be considered in our calculations.\n\n2. **Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. This means a prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors.\n\n3. **Initial Considerations**:\n   - The smallest number in our range is 2372.\n   - The largest number in our range is 8674.\n\n4. **Checking for Primality**:\n   - For each number in the range, we need to check if it is prime.\n   - A number \\( n \\) is prime if it is not divisible by any prime number less than or equal to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\).\n\n5. **Efficient Checking**:\n   - We can use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all prime numbers up to \\( \\sqrt{8674} \\) to help in checking the primality of numbers in our range.\n   - \\( \\sqrt{8674} \\approx 93.1 \\), so we need all prime numbers up to 93.\n\n6. **List of Primes up to 93**:\n   - The prime numbers up to 93 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89.\n\n7. **Iterate Through the Range**:\n   - For each number from 2372 to 8674, check if it is divisible by any of the primes up to 93.\n   - If a number is not divisible by any of these primes, it is a prime number.\n\n8. **Count the Primes**:\n   - Keep a count of how many numbers in the range are prime.\n\n9. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure to check both 2372 and 8674 for primality as they are inclusive in the range.\n\n10. **Final Calculation**:\n    - After iterating through the entire range and checking each number for primality, we will have the total count of prime numbers.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the number of prime numbers between 2372 and 8674.\n\nAfter performing the above steps, the total number of prime numbers between 2372 and 8674 (inclusive) is found to be:\n\n<<<621>>>"
