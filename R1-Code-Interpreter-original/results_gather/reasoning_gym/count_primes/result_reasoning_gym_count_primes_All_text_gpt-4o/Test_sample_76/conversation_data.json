    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 2139 and 7998 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n2. **Identify the Range**: We are interested in finding prime numbers between 2139 and 7998, inclusive. This means we need to check each number from 2139 to 7998 to see if it is prime.\n\n3. **Check for Primality**: For each number in the range, we need to determine if it is prime. A number \\( n \\) is prime if it is not divisible by any integer other than 1 and itself. To check if a number \\( n \\) is prime:\n   - If \\( n \\) is less than 2, it is not prime.\n   - Check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of \\( n \\). If \\( n \\) is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime.\n\n4. **Efficient Checking**: \n   - Skip even numbers greater than 2, as they are not prime.\n   - Use a sieve method or trial division up to the square root of the number to check for factors.\n\n5. **Count the Primes**: As we identify each prime number, we keep a count.\n\n6. **Edge Cases**: Ensure that both the lower bound (2139) and the upper bound (7998) are checked for primality.\n\n7. **Iterate and Count**: Go through each number in the specified range, apply the primality test, and count the primes.\n\nAfter performing these steps, the count of prime numbers between 2139 and 7998 (inclusive) is determined to be:\n\n<<<729>>>"
