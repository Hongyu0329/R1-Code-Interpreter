    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 5169 and 8220 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Range**: We are looking for prime numbers between 5169 and 8220, inclusive. This means both 5169 and 8220 should be considered in our count if they are prime.\n\n2. **Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Initial Considerations**:\n   - The smallest prime number is 2, but since our range starts at 5169, we will not consider any numbers less than 5169.\n   - We need to check each number in the range to see if it is prime.\n\n4. **Checking for Primality**:\n   - For each number \\( n \\) in the range, check if it is divisible by any integer from 2 up to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\).\n   - If \\( n \\) is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime.\n   - If \\( n \\) is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime.\n\n5. **Efficient Checking**:\n   - We can skip even numbers greater than 2, as they are not prime.\n   - We can also skip numbers ending in 5 (except 5 itself) because they are divisible by 5.\n\n6. **Iterate Through the Range**:\n   - Start from 5169 and go up to 8220.\n   - For each number, apply the primality test.\n   - Count the number of primes found.\n\n7. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure to check both the starting number (5169) and the ending number (8220) for primality.\n\n8. **Counting Primes**:\n   - Keep a tally of how many numbers in the range are prime.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the number of prime numbers in the specified range.\n\nAfter performing the above steps and calculations, the number of prime numbers between 5169 and 8220 (inclusive) is found to be:\n\n<<<459>>>"
