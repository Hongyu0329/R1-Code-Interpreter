    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 9689 and 9867 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Range**: We are looking for prime numbers between 9689 and 9867, including both endpoints.\n\n2. **Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Check Each Number for Primality**: We need to check each number in the range to see if it is prime. This involves:\n   - Checking divisibility by all prime numbers up to the square root of the number in question. If a number is not divisible by any of these primes, it is a prime number.\n\n4. **List of Prime Numbers for Divisibility Check**: We will use known small prime numbers to check divisibility. These include 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, etc., up to the approximate square root of the largest number in our range (9867), which is about 99. \n\n5. **Iterate Through the Range**: We will check each number from 9689 to 9867:\n   - If a number is divisible by any of the small primes, it is not a prime.\n   - If a number is not divisible by any of these primes, it is a prime number.\n\n6. **Count the Prime Numbers**: Keep a count of how many numbers in the range are prime.\n\nLet's go through the numbers:\n\n- **9689**: Check divisibility by primes up to √9689 ≈ 98. It is not divisible by any, so it is prime.\n- **9690**: Even number, divisible by 2, not prime.\n- **9691**: Check divisibility by primes up to √9691 ≈ 98. It is not divisible by any, so it is prime.\n- **9692**: Even number, divisible by 2, not prime.\n- **9693**: Divisible by 3, not prime.\n- **9694**: Even number, divisible by 2, not prime.\n- **9695**: Divisible by 5, not prime.\n- **9696**: Even number, divisible by 2, not prime.\n- **9697**: Check divisibility by primes up to √9697 ≈ 98.
