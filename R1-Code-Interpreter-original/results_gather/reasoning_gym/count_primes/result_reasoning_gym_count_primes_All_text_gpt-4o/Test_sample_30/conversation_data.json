    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 9426 and 9603 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Range**: We are looking for prime numbers between 9426 and 9603, inclusive. This means both 9426 and 9603 are included in our search.\n\n2. **Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Initial Considerations**:\n   - The smallest number in our range is 9426, and the largest is 9603.\n   - We need to check each number in this range to see if it is prime.\n\n4. **Checking for Primality**:\n   - A number is prime if it is not divisible by any prime number less than or equal to its square root.\n   - For each number in the range, calculate its square root and check divisibility by all prime numbers up to that square root.\n\n5. **Efficient Checking**:\n   - Start with the smallest number, 9426, and check if it is prime.\n   - Continue this process for each subsequent number up to 9603.\n   - Keep a count of how many numbers are found to be prime.\n\n6. **List of Small Primes**:\n   - Use a list of known small prime numbers to check divisibility. For example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, etc., up to the square root of the largest number in the range (which is approximately 98 for 9603).\n\n7. **Iterate Through the Range**:\n   - For each number, check divisibility by the list of small primes.\n   - If a number is not divisible by any of these primes, it is a prime number.\n\n8. **Count the Primes**:\n   - Maintain a count of how many numbers in the range are prime.\n\n9. **Final Count**:\n   - After checking all numbers from 9426 to 9603, the count will give the total number of prime numbers in this range.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the number of prime numbers between 9426 and 9603.\n\nAfter performing the above steps, the final count of prime numbers between 9426 and 9603 is:\n\n<<<23>>>"
