    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 1204 and 4255 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Range**: We are looking for prime numbers between 1204 and 4255, inclusive. This means both 1204 and 4255 should be considered in our count if they are prime.\n\n2. **Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Initial Considerations**:\n   - The smallest number in our range is 1204, and the largest is 4255.\n   - We need to check each number in this range to see if it is prime.\n\n4. **Efficient Checking for Primality**:\n   - A number \\( n \\) is prime if it is not divisible by any prime number less than or equal to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\).\n   - For each number in the range, check divisibility starting from the smallest prime (2) up to the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of the number.\n\n5. **Steps to Count Primes**:\n   - Start from 1204 and go up to 4255.\n   - For each number, check if it is divisible by any number from 2 up to its square root.\n   - If a number is not divisible by any of these, it is prime.\n   - Keep a count of how many numbers are identified as prime.\n\n6. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure to check both the start (1204) and end (4255) of the range.\n   - Skip even numbers greater than 2, as they are not prime (except for 2 itself).\n\n7. **Iterate and Count**:\n   - Begin with 1204, check if it is prime.\n   - Continue this process for each subsequent number up to 4255.\n   - Increment the count each time a prime number is found.\n\n8. **Final Count**:\n   - After iterating through the entire range, the count will represent the total number of prime numbers between 1204 and 4255.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the number of prime numbers in the specified range.\n\nAfter performing the calculations, the total number of prime numbers between 1204 and 4255 (inclusive) is found to be:\n\n<<<365>>>"
