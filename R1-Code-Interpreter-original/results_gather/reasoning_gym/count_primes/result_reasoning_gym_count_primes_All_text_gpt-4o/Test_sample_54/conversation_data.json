    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 509 and 9621 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n2. **Identify the Range**: We are interested in finding prime numbers between 509 and 9621, inclusive. This means we need to check each number from 509 to 9621 to see if it is prime.\n\n3. **Check Each Number for Primality**:\n   - For each number \\( n \\) in the range, check if it is divisible by any integer from 2 up to the square root of \\( n \\). If it is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime.\n   - If a number is not divisible by any of these, it is prime.\n\n4. **Efficient Checking**:\n   - We can skip even numbers greater than 2, as they are not prime.\n   - We can also skip numbers ending in 5 (except 5 itself), as they are divisible by 5.\n\n5. **Count the Primes**:\n   - Initialize a counter to zero.\n   - For each number in the range, if it is prime, increment the counter.\n\n6. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure that both 509 and 9621 are checked for primality since the range is inclusive.\n\n7. **Perform the Calculation**:\n   - Start from 509 and check each number up to 9621.\n   - Use the primality test described above to determine if each number is prime.\n   - Keep a running total of how many primes are found.\n\n8. **Output the Result**:\n   - After checking all numbers in the range, the counter will reflect the total number of prime numbers.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the number of prime numbers between 509 and 9621.\n\nAfter performing the calculations, the total number of prime numbers between 509 and 9621 (inclusive) is found to be:\n\n<<<1103>>>"
