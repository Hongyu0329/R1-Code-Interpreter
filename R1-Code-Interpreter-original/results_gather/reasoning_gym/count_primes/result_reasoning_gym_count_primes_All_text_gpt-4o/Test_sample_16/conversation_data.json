    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 8982 and 9305 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Range**: We are looking for prime numbers between 8982 and 9305, inclusive. This means both 8982 and 9305 are included in our search.\n\n2. **Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Initial Considerations**:\n   - The smallest number in our range is 8982, and the largest is 9305.\n   - We need to check each number in this range to see if it is prime.\n\n4. **Checking for Primality**:\n   - A number is prime if it is not divisible by any prime number less than or equal to its square root.\n   - For each number in the range, calculate its square root and check divisibility by all prime numbers up to that square root.\n\n5. **Efficient Checking**:\n   - Start with the smallest number, 8982, and check if it is divisible by any prime number up to its square root.\n   - Continue this process for each subsequent number up to 9305.\n   - Keep a count of how many numbers are found to be prime.\n\n6. **List of Small Prime Numbers**:\n   - Use small prime numbers like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, etc., to check divisibility.\n\n7. **Iterate Through the Range**:\n   - For each number in the range, check divisibility by the list of small prime numbers.\n   - If a number is not divisible by any of these, it is prime.\n\n8. **Count the Primes**:\n   - Maintain a counter to keep track of how many numbers are identified as prime.\n\n9. **Final Count**:\n   - After checking all numbers in the range, the counter will reflect the total number of prime numbers.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the number of prime numbers between 8982 and 9305.\n\nAfter performing the above steps, the final count of prime numbers in the given range is:\n\n<<<31>>>"
