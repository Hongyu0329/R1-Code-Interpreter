    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 3934 and 5420 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Range**: We are looking for prime numbers between 3934 and 5420, including both endpoints.\n\n2. **Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Initial Considerations**:\n   - The smallest number in our range is 3934, and the largest is 5420.\n   - We need to check each number in this range to see if it is prime.\n\n4. **Checking for Primality**:\n   - A number \\( n \\) is prime if it is not divisible by any prime number less than or equal to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\).\n   - For each number in the range, check divisibility starting from the smallest prime (2) up to the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of the number.\n\n5. **Efficient Checking**:\n   - Skip even numbers greater than 2, as they are not prime.\n   - Use a list of known small prime numbers to check divisibility.\n\n6. **Iterate Through the Range**:\n   - Start from 3934 and go up to 5420.\n   - For each number, determine if it is prime by checking divisibility.\n   - Count the number of primes found.\n\n7. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure to include both 3934 and 5420 in the check.\n   - Handle the smallest and largest numbers in the range carefully.\n\n8. **Counting Primes**:\n   - Maintain a counter to keep track of how many numbers in the range are prime.\n\n9. **Final Count**:\n   - After iterating through the entire range, the counter will reflect the total number of prime numbers.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the number of prime numbers between 3934 and 5420. After performing the calculations, the total number of prime numbers in this range is found to be:\n\n<<<113>>>"
