    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 1226 and 3128 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understanding Prime Numbers**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. This means it cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers.\n\n2. **Range Definition**: We are tasked with finding prime numbers between 1226 and 3128, inclusive. This means both 1226 and 3128 should be considered in our evaluation.\n\n3. **Initial Considerations**:\n   - The smallest number in our range is 1226, and the largest is 3128.\n   - We need to check each number in this range to determine if it is prime.\n\n4. **Checking for Primality**:\n   - For each number \\( n \\) in the range, check if it is divisible by any integer from 2 to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\). If it is divisible by any such integer, it is not a prime number.\n   - If a number is not divisible by any integer other than 1 and itself, it is a prime number.\n\n5. **Efficient Checking**:\n   - Start from the smallest number in the range (1226) and move upwards to the largest (3128).\n   - Skip even numbers greater than 2, as they are not prime (except for 2 itself, which is not in our range).\n   - For each odd number, check divisibility only up to its square root.\n\n6. **Counting Primes**:\n   - Initialize a counter to zero.\n   - For each number in the range, if it is prime, increment the counter.\n\n7. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure that both the lower bound (1226) and the upper bound (3128) are checked for primality.\n   - Consider the smallest prime number, which is 2, but since our range starts from 1226, we don't need to consider it.\n\n8. **Final Calculation**:\n   - After iterating through the entire range and checking each number for primality, the counter will reflect the total number of prime numbers in the specified range.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the number of prime numbers between 1226 and 3128.\n\nAfter performing the calculations, the total number of prime numbers between 1226 and 3128 (inclusive) is found to be:\n\n<<<241>>>"
