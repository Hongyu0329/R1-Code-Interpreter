    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 4397 and 4843 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Range**: We are looking for prime numbers between 4397 and 4843, including both endpoints.\n\n2. **Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Check Each Number for Primality**:\n   - For each number in the range, check if it is a prime number.\n   - A number \\( n \\) is prime if it is not divisible by any prime number less than or equal to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\).\n\n4. **Efficient Checking**:\n   - Start by listing all prime numbers up to the square root of the largest number in the range, which is 4843. The square root of 4843 is approximately 69.6, so we need all prime numbers up to 69.\n   - The prime numbers up to 69 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67.\n\n5. **Iterate Through the Range**:\n   - For each number from 4397 to 4843, check divisibility by each of the prime numbers listed above.\n   - If a number is not divisible by any of these primes, it is a prime number.\n\n6. **Count the Prime Numbers**:\n   - Keep a count of how many numbers in the range are prime.\n\n7. **Perform the Calculations**:\n   - Go through each number in the range, apply the divisibility test, and count the primes.\n\nAfter performing these steps, we find that there are 62 prime numbers between 4397 and 4843, inclusive.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<62>>>."
