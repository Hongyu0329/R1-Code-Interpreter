    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 7852 and 7920 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Range**: We are looking for prime numbers between 7852 and 7920, including both endpoints.\n\n2. **Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Check Each Number in the Range**: We need to check each number from 7852 to 7920 to see if it is prime.\n\n4. **Efficient Prime Checking**:\n   - A number \\( n \\) is prime if it is not divisible by any prime number less than or equal to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\).\n   - For each number in the range, check divisibility starting from the smallest prime (2) up to the largest integer less than or equal to its square root.\n\n5. **List of Prime Numbers**:\n   - Start with the first number in the range, 7852, and check if it is prime.\n   - Continue this process for each subsequent number up to 7920.\n\n6. **Prime Checking Process**:\n   - For each number, check divisibility by 2. If divisible, it is not prime.\n   - If not divisible by 2, check divisibility by subsequent odd numbers up to the square root of the number.\n   - If a number is not divisible by any of these, it is prime.\n\n7. **Count the Primes**: Keep a count of how many numbers in the range are prime.\n\n8. **Perform the Calculations**:\n   - 7852: Not prime (divisible by 2)\n   - 7853: Prime\n   - 7854: Not prime (divisible by 2)\n   - 7855: Not prime (divisible by 5)\n   - 7856: Not prime (divisible by 2)\n   - 7857: Not prime (divisible by 3)\n   - 7858: Not prime (divisible by 2)\n   - 7859: Prime\n   - 7860: Not prime (divisible by 2)\n   - 7861: Not prime (divisible by 3)\n   - 7862: Not prime (divisible by 2)\n   - 7863: Not prime (divisible by 3)\n   - 7864: Not prime (divisible by 2)\n   - 7865: Not prime (divisible by 5)\n   - 7866: Not prime (divisible by 2)\n   - 7867: Prime\n   - 7868: Not prime (divisible by 2)\n   - 7869: Not prime (divisible by 3)\n   - 7870: Not prime (divisible by 2)\n   - 7871: Not prime (divisible by 7)\n   - 7872: Not prime (divisible by 2)\n   - 7873: Prime\n   - 7874: Not prime (divisible by 2)\n   - 7875: Not prime (divisible by 5)\n   - 7876: Not prime (divisible by 2)\n   - 7877: Prime\n   - 7878: Not prime (divisible by 2)\n   - 7879: Prime\n   - 7880: Not prime (divisible by 2)\n   - 7881: Not prime (divisible by 3)\n   - 7882: Not prime (divisible by 2)\n   - 7883: Prime\n   - 7884: Not prime (divisible by 2)\n   - 7885: Not prime (divisible by 5)\n   - 7886: Not prime (divisible by 2)\n   - 7887: Not prime (divisible by 3)\n   - 7888: Not prime (divisible by 2)\n   - 7889: Not prime (divisible by 7)\n   - 7890: Not prime (divisible by 2)\n   - 7891: Not prime (divisible by 3)\n   - 7892: Not prime (divisible by 2)\n   - 7893: Not prime (divisible by 3)\n   - 7894: Not prime (divisible by 2)\n   - 7895: Not prime (divisible by 5)\n   - 7896: Not prime (divisible by 2)\n   - 7897: Prime\n   - 7898: Not prime (divisible by 2)\n   - 7899: Not prime (divisible by 3)\n   - 7900: Not prime (divisible by 2)\n   - 7901: Prime\n   - 7902: Not prime (divisible by 2)\n   - 7903: Not prime (divisible by 3)\n   - 7904: Not prime (divisible by 2)\n   - 7905: Not prime (divisible by 5)\n   - 7906: Not prime (divisible by 2)\n   - 7907: Prime\n   - 7908: Not prime (divisible by 2)\n   - 7909: Not prime (divisible by 3)\n   - 7910: Not prime (divisible by 2)\n   - 7911: Not prime (divisible by 3)\n   - 7912: Not prime (divisible by 2)\n   - 7913: Prime\n   - 7914: Not prime (divisible by 2)\n   - 7915: Not prime (divisible by 5)\n   - 7916: Not prime (divisible by 2)\n   - 7917: Not prime (divisible by 3)\n   - 7918: Not prime (divisible by 2)\n   - 7919: Prime\n   - 7920: Not prime (divisible by 2)\n\n9. **Count the Primes**: The prime numbers in this range are 7853, 7859, 7867, 7873, 7877, 7879, 7883, 7897, 7901, 7907, 7913, and 7919.\n\n10. **Final Count**: There are 12 prime numbers between 7852 and 7920 (inclusive).\n\nThe final answer is: <<<12>>>."
