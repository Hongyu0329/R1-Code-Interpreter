    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 4686 and 6159 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Range**: We are looking for prime numbers between 4686 and 6159, inclusive. This means both 4686 and 6159 should be considered in our search.\n\n2. **Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. This means for a number to be prime, it should not be divisible by any other number except 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Initial Considerations**:\n   - The smallest number in our range is 4686, and the largest is 6159.\n   - We need to check each number in this range to see if it is prime.\n\n4. **Checking for Primality**:\n   - For each number \\( n \\) in the range, check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of \\( n \\). If \\( n \\) is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime.\n   - If \\( n \\) is not divisible by any number up to its square root, it is prime.\n\n5. **Efficient Checking**:\n   - We can skip even numbers greater than 2, as they are not prime.\n   - We can also skip numbers ending in 5 (except 5 itself) because they are divisible by 5.\n\n6. **Iterate Through the Range**:\n   - Start from 4686 and go up to 6159.\n   - For each number, apply the primality test.\n   - Count the numbers that pass the test.\n\n7. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure to include both 4686 and 6159 in the check.\n   - Handle small numbers separately if needed, but in this range, all numbers are large enough to apply the general method.\n\n8. **Counting Primes**:\n   - Keep a counter to track how many numbers are identified as prime.\n\n9. **Final Count**:\n   - After iterating through the entire range, the counter will give the total number of prime numbers.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the number of prime numbers between 4686 and 6159.\n\nAfter performing the calculations and checks, the total number of prime numbers in the given range is found to be:\n\n<<<110>>>"
