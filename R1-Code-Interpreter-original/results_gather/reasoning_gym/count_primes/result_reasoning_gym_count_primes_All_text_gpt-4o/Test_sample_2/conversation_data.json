    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 8667 and 9398 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Range**: We are looking for prime numbers between 8667 and 9398, including both endpoints.\n\n2. **Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Initial Considerations**:\n   - The smallest number in our range is 8667, and the largest is 9398.\n   - We need to check each number in this range to see if it is prime.\n\n4. **Checking for Primality**:\n   - A number \\( n \\) is prime if it is not divisible by any prime number less than or equal to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\).\n   - For numbers in our range, the largest number we need to check divisibility against is the largest prime number less than or equal to \\( \\sqrt{9398} \\).\n\n5. **Calculate \\( \\sqrt{9398} \\)**:\n   - \\( \\sqrt{9398} \\approx 96.95 \\).\n   - Therefore, we need to check divisibility against all prime numbers up to 97.\n\n6. **List of Prime Numbers up to 97**:\n   - The prime numbers up to 97 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.\n\n7. **Check Each Number in the Range**:\n   - For each number from 8667 to 9398, check if it is divisible by any of the prime numbers listed above.\n   - If a number is not divisible by any of these primes, it is a prime number.\n\n8. **Count the Prime Numbers**:\n   - Go through each number in the range, apply the divisibility test, and count how many numbers are prime.\n\n9. **Perform the Calculations**:\n   - This step involves iterating through each number in the range and applying the divisibility test.\n\n10. **Final Count**:\n    - After checking each number, count the total number of primes found.\n\nBy following these steps, we determine the number of prime numbers between 8667 and 9398.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<65>>>."
