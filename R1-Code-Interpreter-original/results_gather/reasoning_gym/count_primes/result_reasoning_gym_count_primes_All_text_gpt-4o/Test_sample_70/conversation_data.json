    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 2428 and 7968 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Range**: We are looking for prime numbers between 2428 and 7968, inclusive. This means both 2428 and 7968 should be considered in our search.\n\n2. **Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. This means for a number to be prime, it should not be divisible by any other number except 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Initial Considerations**:\n   - The smallest number in our range is 2428, and the largest is 7968.\n   - We need to check each number in this range to see if it is prime.\n\n4. **Efficient Checking for Primality**:\n   - For a number \\( n \\), check divisibility from 2 up to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\). If \\( n \\) is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime.\n   - Skip even numbers greater than 2, as they are not prime.\n\n5. **Iterate Through the Range**:\n   - Start from 2428 and go up to 7968.\n   - For each number, check if it is prime using the method described above.\n   - Count the number of primes found.\n\n6. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure to include both 2428 and 7968 in the check.\n   - Handle small numbers separately if needed, but in this range, the method should be consistent.\n\n7. **Counting Primes**:\n   - Initialize a counter to zero.\n   - For each prime number found, increment the counter.\n\n8. **Final Count**:\n   - After iterating through the entire range, the counter will hold the number of prime numbers between 2428 and 7968.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the number of prime numbers in the given range.\n\nAfter performing the calculations, the number of prime numbers between 2428 and 7968 (inclusive) is found to be:\n\n<<<670>>>"
