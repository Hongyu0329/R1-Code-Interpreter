    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 3075 and 3861 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Range**: We are looking for prime numbers between 3075 and 3861, inclusive. This means both 3075 and 3861 are included in our search.\n\n2. **Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Initial Considerations**:\n   - The smallest number in our range is 3075.\n   - The largest number in our range is 3861.\n\n4. **Exclude Even Numbers**: \n   - Except for the number 2, all even numbers are not prime because they are divisible by 2. \n   - Since 3075 is odd, we start checking from 3075 and skip even numbers.\n\n5. **Check for Divisibility**:\n   - For each odd number in the range, check if it is divisible by any odd number starting from 3 up to the square root of the number.\n   - If a number is not divisible by any of these, it is prime.\n\n6. **Efficient Checking**:\n   - Use the 6k ± 1 rule: All primes greater than 3 are of the form 6k ± 1. This can help reduce the number of checks.\n   - For each candidate number, check divisibility by known small primes (3, 5, 7, 11, etc.) up to the square root of the number.\n\n7. **Iterate Through the Range**:\n   - Start from 3075 and go up to 3861.\n   - For each number, determine if it is prime using the above methods.\n\n8. **Count the Primes**:\n   - Maintain a count of how many numbers in the range are prime.\n\n9. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure to check both the starting number (3075) and the ending number (3861) for primality.\n\n10. **Final Count**:\n    - After iterating through the range and checking each number, the count will give the total number of prime numbers.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the number of prime numbers between 3075 and 3861.\n\nAfter performing the calculations and checks, the total number of prime numbers between 3075 and 3861 (inclusive) is found to be:\n\n<<<58>>>"
