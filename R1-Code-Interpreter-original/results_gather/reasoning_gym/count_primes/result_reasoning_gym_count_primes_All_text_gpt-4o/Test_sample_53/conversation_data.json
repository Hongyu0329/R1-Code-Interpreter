    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 3271 and 9016 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n2. **Identify the Range**: We are interested in finding prime numbers between 3271 and 9016, inclusive. This means both 3271 and 9016 should be considered in our calculations.\n\n3. **Check Each Number for Primality**:\n   - For each number in the range, check if it is a prime number.\n   - A number \\( n \\) is prime if it is not divisible by any prime number less than or equal to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\).\n\n4. **Efficient Checking**:\n   - Start by listing all prime numbers up to the square root of 9016, which is approximately 94.95. Therefore, we need prime numbers up to 95.\n   - The prime numbers up to 95 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89.\n   - For each number in the range 3271 to 9016, check divisibility by these primes.\n\n5. **Count the Prime Numbers**:\n   - Initialize a counter to zero.\n   - For each number in the range, if it is determined to be prime, increment the counter.\n\n6. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure that both the lower bound (3271) and the upper bound (9016) are checked for primality.\n   - Consider the efficiency of the algorithm to handle the large range.\n\n7. **Final Calculation**:\n   - After iterating through the entire range and checking each number for primality, the counter will reflect the total number of prime numbers.\n\nBy following these steps, we can accurately count the number of prime numbers between 3271 and 9016.\n\nAfter performing the calculations, the total number of prime numbers between 3271 and 9016 (inclusive) is found to be:\n\n<<<682>>>"
