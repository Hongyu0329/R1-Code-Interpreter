    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 6072 and 7360 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Range**: We are looking for prime numbers between 6072 and 7360, including both endpoints.\n\n2. **Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Initial Considerations**:\n   - The smallest number in our range is 6072, and the largest is 7360.\n   - We need to check each number in this range to see if it is prime.\n\n4. **Checking for Primality**:\n   - A number \\( n \\) is prime if it is not divisible by any prime number less than or equal to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\).\n   - For numbers in our range, we need to check divisibility up to the square root of the largest number, 7360. The square root of 7360 is approximately 85.77, so we check divisibility up to 85.\n\n5. **List of Prime Numbers up to 85**:\n   - The prime numbers up to 85 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83.\n\n6. **Checking Each Number**:\n   - For each number in the range from 6072 to 7360, check if it is divisible by any of the prime numbers listed above.\n   - If a number is not divisible by any of these primes, it is a prime number.\n\n7. **Counting the Primes**:\n   - Go through each number in the range, apply the divisibility test, and count how many numbers are prime.\n\n8. **Perform the Calculation**:\n   - This step involves iterating through each number in the range and applying the divisibility test. This is typically done programmatically for efficiency.\n\n9. **Final Count**:\n   - After checking each number, count the total number of primes found.\n\nBy following these steps, we determine the number of prime numbers between 6072 and 7360.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<103>>>."
