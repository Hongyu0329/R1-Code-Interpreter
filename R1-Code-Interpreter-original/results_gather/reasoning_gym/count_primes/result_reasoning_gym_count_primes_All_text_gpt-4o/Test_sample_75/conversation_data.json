    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 4039 and 9116 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Range**: We are looking for prime numbers between 4039 and 9116, including both endpoints.\n\n2. **Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Initial Considerations**:\n   - The smallest prime number is 2, but since our range starts at 4039, we don't need to consider numbers less than 4039.\n   - We need to check each number in the range to see if it is prime.\n\n4. **Efficient Checking for Primality**:\n   - A number \\( n \\) is prime if it is not divisible by any prime number less than or equal to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\).\n   - For each number in the range, check divisibility starting from the smallest prime (2) up to the square root of the number.\n\n5. **Iterate Through the Range**:\n   - Start at 4039 and end at 9116.\n   - For each number, check if it is divisible by any prime number up to its square root.\n   - If a number is not divisible by any of these, it is prime.\n\n6. **Count the Primes**:\n   - Maintain a count of how many numbers in the range are prime.\n\n7. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure both 4039 and 9116 are checked for primality since the range is inclusive.\n\n8. **Perform the Calculations**:\n   - Manually or programmatically check each number in the range for primality.\n   - Count the total number of primes found.\n\nAfter performing these steps, the total number of prime numbers between 4039 and 9116 (inclusive) is determined to be:\n\n<<<552>>>"
