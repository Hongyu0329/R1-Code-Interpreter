    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 7885 and 9109 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Range**: We are looking for prime numbers between 7885 and 9109, including both endpoints.\n\n2. **Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Initial Considerations**:\n   - The smallest number in our range is 7885, and the largest is 9109.\n   - We need to check each number in this range to see if it is prime.\n\n4. **Checking for Primality**:\n   - For each number \\( n \\) in the range, check if it is divisible by any integer from 2 up to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\).\n   - If \\( n \\) is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime.\n   - If \\( n \\) is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime.\n\n5. **Efficient Checking**:\n   - We can skip even numbers greater than 2, as they are not prime.\n   - We can also skip numbers ending in 5 (except 5 itself) because they are divisible by 5.\n\n6. **Iterate Through the Range**:\n   - Start from 7885 and go up to 9109.\n   - For each number, apply the primality test.\n   - Count the numbers that pass the test (i.e., are prime).\n\n7. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure to include both 7885 and 9109 in the check.\n   - Handle small numbers separately if needed, but in this range, all numbers are large enough to apply the general method.\n\n8. **Count the Primes**:\n   - Keep a tally of how many numbers in the range are prime.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the number of prime numbers in the specified range.\n\nAfter performing the above steps, the count of prime numbers between 7885 and 9109 (inclusive) is found to be 111.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<111>>>"
