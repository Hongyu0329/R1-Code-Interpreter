    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 8443 and 8675 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Range**: We are looking for prime numbers between 8443 and 8675, inclusive. This means both 8443 and 8675 should be considered in our search.\n\n2. **Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. This means for a number to be prime, it should not be divisible by any other number except 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Check Each Number in the Range**: We need to check each number from 8443 to 8675 to see if it is prime. This involves:\n   - Checking divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number (since if a number \\( n \\) is divisible by any number greater than its square root, it must also be divisible by a number smaller than its square root).\n\n4. **Efficient Checking**: \n   - For each number, check divisibility starting from the smallest prime number, 2, and continue with subsequent prime numbers (3, 5, 7, etc.) up to the square root of the number.\n   - If a number is not divisible by any of these, it is prime.\n\n5. **Count the Primes**: Keep a count of how many numbers in the range are prime.\n\n6. **Edge Cases**: \n   - Ensure to check both the starting number (8443) and the ending number (8675) for primality.\n   - Remember that even numbers greater than 2 are not prime, so they can be skipped in the checking process.\n\nNow, let's apply this process to the range 8443 to 8675:\n\n- **8443**: Check divisibility by primes up to \\(\\sqrt{8443} \\approx 91.9\\). It is not divisible by any prime numbers up to 91, so it is prime.\n- **8444 to 8675**: Continue this process for each number, skipping even numbers and checking only odd numbers for primality.\n\nAfter checking each number in the range, we find that the prime numbers are: 8443, 8447, 8461, 8467, 8501, 8513, 8521, 8527, 8537, 8539, 8543, 8563, 8573, 8581, 8597, 8599, 8609, 8623, 8627, 8629, 8641, 8647, 8663.\n\nCounting these, we find there are 23 prime numbers in the range.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<23>>>"
