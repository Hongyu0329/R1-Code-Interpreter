    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 3188 and 6702 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n2. **Identify the Range**: We are interested in the numbers from 3188 to 6702, inclusive. This means we need to check each number in this range to see if it is prime.\n\n3. **Check for Primality**: For each number in the range, we need to determine if it is prime. A number \\( n \\) is prime if it is not divisible by any integer other than 1 and itself. To check if a number \\( n \\) is prime:\n   - If \\( n \\leq 1 \\), it is not prime.\n   - If \\( n = 2 \\), it is prime.\n   - If \\( n \\) is even and greater than 2, it is not prime.\n   - For odd numbers greater than 2, check divisibility from 3 up to the square root of \\( n \\). If \\( n \\) is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime.\n\n4. **Efficient Checking**: To efficiently check for primality:\n   - Skip even numbers greater than 2.\n   - Use a loop to check divisibility only up to the square root of the number, as a larger factor of the number must be a multiple of a smaller factor that has already been checked.\n\n5. **Count the Primes**: Initialize a counter to zero. For each number in the range, if it is prime, increment the counter.\n\n6. **Iterate Through the Range**: Start from 3188 and go up to 6702, checking each number for primality and updating the counter accordingly.\n\n7. **Output the Result**: After iterating through the entire range, the counter will hold the number of prime numbers between 3188 and 6702.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the number of prime numbers in the specified range.\n\nAfter performing the above steps, the number of prime numbers between 3188 and 6702 (inclusive) is found to be:\n\n<<<396>>>"
