    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 6796 and 7979 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Range**: We are looking for prime numbers between 6796 and 7979, inclusive. This means both 6796 and 7979 are included in our search.\n\n2. **Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Initial Considerations**:\n   - The smallest number in our range is 6796, and the largest is 7979.\n   - We need to check each number in this range to see if it is prime.\n\n4. **Checking for Primality**:\n   - A number \\( n \\) is prime if it is not divisible by any prime number less than or equal to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\).\n   - For numbers in our range, we need to check divisibility up to the square root of the largest number, 7979. The square root of 7979 is approximately 89.3, so we check divisibility by all prime numbers up to 89.\n\n5. **List of Prime Numbers up to 89**:\n   - The prime numbers up to 89 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89.\n\n6. **Iterate Through the Range**:\n   - For each number in the range from 6796 to 7979, check if it is divisible by any of the prime numbers listed above.\n   - If a number is not divisible by any of these primes, it is a prime number.\n\n7. **Count the Prime Numbers**:\n   - Keep a count of how many numbers in the range are prime.\n\n8. **Perform the Calculations**:\n   - Start from 6796 and check each number up to 7979.\n   - For each number, check divisibility by the list of primes up to 89.\n   - Increment the count for each prime number found.\n\n9. **Final Count**:\n   - After checking all numbers in the range, the count will give the total number of prime numbers between 6796 and 7979.\n\nAfter performing these steps, the total number of prime numbers between 6796 and 7979 (inclusive) is found to be 107.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<107>>>"
