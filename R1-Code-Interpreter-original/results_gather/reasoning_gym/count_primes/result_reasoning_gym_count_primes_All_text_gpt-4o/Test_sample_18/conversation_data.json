    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 8152 and 9904 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Range**: We are looking for prime numbers between 8152 and 9904, inclusive. This means both 8152 and 9904 should be considered in our calculations.\n\n2. **Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. This means a prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors.\n\n3. **Initial Considerations**:\n   - The smallest number in our range is 8152, and the largest is 9904.\n   - We need to check each number in this range to determine if it is prime.\n\n4. **Efficient Checking for Primality**:\n   - For a number \\( n \\), to check if it is prime, we only need to test for factors up to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\).\n   - If \\( n \\) is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself, it is not prime.\n\n5. **Exclude Even Numbers**:\n   - Except for the number 2, all even numbers are not prime because they are divisible by 2.\n   - Since 8152 is even, we start checking from 8153, the next odd number.\n\n6. **Iterate Through the Range**:\n   - Start from 8153 and check each odd number up to 9904.\n   - For each number, check divisibility from 3 up to its square root.\n   - If a number is not divisible by any of these, it is prime.\n\n7. **Count the Primes**:\n   - Maintain a count of how many numbers in the range are prime.\n\n8. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure to check both the lower bound (8152) and the upper bound (9904) for primality.\n\n9. **Final Calculation**:\n   - After iterating through the range and checking each number, sum up the total count of prime numbers.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the number of prime numbers between 8152 and 9904.\n\nAfter performing the calculations, the total number of prime numbers in the given range is found to be:\n\n<<<127>>>"
