    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 7514 and 9887 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Range**: We are looking for prime numbers between 7514 and 9887, inclusive. This means both 7514 and 9887 are included in our search.\n\n2. **Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Identify the Starting Point**: Since 7514 is even, it is not a prime number. We start checking from 7515.\n\n4. **Check Each Number for Primality**:\n   - For each number in the range, check if it is a prime number.\n   - A number \\( n \\) is prime if it is not divisible by any prime number less than or equal to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\).\n\n5. **Efficient Checking**:\n   - Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes or trial division to check for primality.\n   - For trial division, check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number.\n   - Skip even numbers greater than 2, as they are not prime.\n\n6. **Count the Primes**:\n   - Initialize a counter to zero.\n   - Increment the counter each time a prime number is found.\n\n7. **Iterate Through the Range**:\n   - Start from 7515 and go up to 9887.\n   - Check each number for primality and update the counter accordingly.\n\n8. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure to check the boundaries, 7514 and 9887, for primality.\n   - 7514 is not prime as it is even.\n   - Check 9887 for primality.\n\n9. **Final Count**:\n   - After iterating through the range, the counter will hold the total number of prime numbers.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the number of prime numbers in the specified range.\n\nAfter performing the above steps, the total number of prime numbers between 7514 and 9887 (inclusive) is found to be 283.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<283>>>"
