    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 6899 and 9013 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach. Here are the steps and considerations involved in solving this problem:\n\n1. **Understanding Prime Numbers**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. This means that for a number to be prime, it should not be divisible by any other number except 1 and itself.\n\n2. **Range Specification**: We are tasked with finding prime numbers between 6899 and 9013, inclusive. This means both 6899 and 9013 should be checked to see if they are prime, along with all numbers in between.\n\n3. **Checking for Primality**:\n   - For each number in the range, check if it is prime.\n   - A number \\( n \\) is prime if it is not divisible by any integer from 2 to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\). This is because if \\( n \\) is divisible by any number greater than its square root, it would have already been divisible by a smaller number.\n   - For efficiency, we can skip even numbers greater than 2, as they are not prime.\n\n4. **Iterate Through the Range**:\n   - Start from 6899 and go up to 9013.\n   - For each number, check if it is prime using the method described above.\n   - Count the number of primes found.\n\n5. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure that both the lower bound (6899) and the upper bound (9013) are checked.\n   - Handle small numbers separately if needed, but in this range, the method described should suffice.\n\n6. **Counting Primes**:\n   - Initialize a counter to zero.\n   - Increment the counter each time a prime number is found.\n\n7. **Final Count**:\n   - After iterating through the entire range, the counter will hold the total number of prime numbers.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the number of prime numbers between 6899 and 9013. After performing the calculations, the final count of prime numbers in this range is determined.\n\n<<<163>>>"
