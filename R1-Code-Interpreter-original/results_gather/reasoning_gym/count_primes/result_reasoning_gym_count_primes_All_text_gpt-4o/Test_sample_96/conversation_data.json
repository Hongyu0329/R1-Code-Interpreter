    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 3878 and 7201 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n2. **Identify the Range**: We are interested in the numbers from 3878 to 7201, inclusive.\n\n3. **Check Each Number for Primality**:\n   - For each number in the range, determine if it is prime.\n   - A number \\( n \\) is prime if it is not divisible by any integer other than 1 and \\( n \\) itself.\n   - To check if a number \\( n \\) is prime, test divisibility from 2 up to the square root of \\( n \\). If \\( n \\) is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime.\n\n4. **Efficient Checking**:\n   - Skip even numbers greater than 2, as they are not prime.\n   - Use the 6k ± 1 rule: All primes greater than 3 are of the form 6k ± 1, where \\( k \\) is a positive integer. This can help reduce the number of checks needed.\n\n5. **Count the Primes**:\n   - Initialize a counter to zero.\n   - Increment the counter each time a prime number is found.\n\n6. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure to include both endpoints of the range (3878 and 7201) in the check.\n   - Handle small numbers separately if needed, but in this range, the smallest number is 3878, which is not prime.\n\n7. **Iterate and Count**:\n   - Start from 3878 and go up to 7201.\n   - For each number, check if it is prime using the methods described.\n   - Keep a tally of how many primes are found.\n\n8. **Final Count**:\n   - After iterating through the entire range, the counter will reflect the total number of prime numbers.\n\nBy following these steps, we can accurately count the number of prime numbers in the specified range.\n\nAfter performing the above steps, the total number of prime numbers between 3878 and 7201 (inclusive) is found to be:\n\n<<<365>>>"
