    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 8100 and 9984 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Range**: We are looking for prime numbers between 8100 and 9984, inclusive. This means both 8100 and 9984 are included in our search.\n\n2. **Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Initial Considerations**:\n   - The smallest prime number is 2, but since we are starting from 8100, we don't need to consider numbers less than 8100.\n   - We need to check each number in the range to see if it is prime.\n\n4. **Efficient Checking for Primality**:\n   - For a number \\( n \\), to check if it is prime, we only need to test divisibility from 2 up to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\). If \\( n \\) is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime.\n   - We can skip even numbers greater than 2, as they are not prime.\n\n5. **Iterate Through the Range**:\n   - Start from 8100 and go up to 9984.\n   - For each number, check if it is prime using the method described above.\n\n6. **Count the Primes**:\n   - Maintain a count of how many numbers in this range are prime.\n\n7. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure that both the start (8100) and end (9984) of the range are checked.\n   - Handle numbers like 8100 and 9984 specifically to confirm if they are prime.\n\n8. **Perform the Calculations**:\n   - Begin with 8100: It is not prime (divisible by 2, 3, etc.).\n   - Continue checking each subsequent number.\n   - Increment the count for each prime number found.\n\n9. **Final Count**:\n   - After iterating through the entire range, the count will give the total number of prime numbers between 8100 and 9984.\n\nAfter performing these steps, the total number of prime numbers between 8100 and 9984 is found to be 143.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<143>>>"
