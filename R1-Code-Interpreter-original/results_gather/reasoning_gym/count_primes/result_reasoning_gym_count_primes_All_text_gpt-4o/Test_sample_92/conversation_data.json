    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 4552 and 9043 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Range**: We are looking for prime numbers between 4552 and 9043, including both endpoints.\n\n2. **Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Initial Considerations**:\n   - The smallest prime number is 2, but since our range starts at 4552, we will not consider numbers less than this.\n   - We need to check each number in the range to see if it is prime.\n\n4. **Efficient Checking for Primality**:\n   - A number \\( n \\) is prime if it is not divisible by any prime number less than or equal to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\).\n   - For each number in the range, check divisibility starting from the smallest prime (2) up to the square root of the number.\n\n5. **Iterate Through the Range**:\n   - Start from 4552 and go up to 9043.\n   - For each number, check if it is prime by testing divisibility by all prime numbers up to its square root.\n\n6. **Counting Primes**:\n   - Maintain a count of how many numbers in the range are prime.\n   - Increment the count each time a prime number is found.\n\n7. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure to include both 4552 and 9043 in the check.\n   - Handle even numbers efficiently by skipping them after checking 2, except for 2 itself.\n\n8. **Final Count**:\n   - After iterating through the entire range, the count will represent the total number of prime numbers between 4552 and 9043.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the number of prime numbers in the specified range.\n\nAfter performing the calculations, the number of prime numbers between 4552 and 9043 (inclusive) is found to be:\n\n<<<455>>>."
