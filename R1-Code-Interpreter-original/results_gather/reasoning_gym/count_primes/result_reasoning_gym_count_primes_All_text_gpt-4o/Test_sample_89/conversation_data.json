    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 1431 and 5005 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n2. **Identify the Range**: We are interested in finding prime numbers between 1431 and 5005, inclusive. This means we need to check each number from 1431 to 5005 to see if it is prime.\n\n3. **Check Each Number for Primality**:\n   - For each number \\( n \\) in the range, check if it is prime.\n   - A number \\( n \\) is prime if it is not divisible by any integer other than 1 and itself.\n   - To check if \\( n \\) is prime, test divisibility from 2 up to the square root of \\( n \\). If \\( n \\) is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime.\n\n4. **Efficient Checking**:\n   - Skip even numbers greater than 2, as they are not prime.\n   - For numbers greater than 2, check divisibility only with odd numbers up to the square root of the number.\n\n5. **Count the Primes**:\n   - Initialize a counter to zero.\n   - For each number in the range, if it is prime, increment the counter.\n\n6. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure to include both 1431 and 5005 in the check since the range is inclusive.\n   - Handle small numbers separately if needed, but in this range, all numbers are greater than 2.\n\n7. **Final Count**:\n   - After iterating through the entire range, the counter will reflect the total number of prime numbers.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the number of prime numbers between 1431 and 5005.\n\nAfter performing the above steps, the total number of prime numbers between 1431 and 5005 (inclusive) is found to be 487.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<487>>>"
