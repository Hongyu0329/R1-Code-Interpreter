    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 3439 and 5566 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Range**: We are looking for prime numbers between 3439 and 5566, inclusive. This means both 3439 and 5566 should be considered in our count if they are prime.\n\n2. **Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Initial Considerations**:\n   - The smallest prime number is 2, but since our range starts at 3439, we don't need to consider numbers less than 3439.\n   - We need to check each number in the range to see if it is prime.\n\n4. **Efficient Checking for Primality**:\n   - For a number \\( n \\), to check if it is prime, we only need to test for factors up to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\).\n   - If \\( n \\) is not divisible by any prime number less than or equal to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\), then \\( n \\) is prime.\n\n5. **Steps to Find Prime Numbers in the Range**:\n   - Start at 3439 and check each number up to 5566.\n   - For each number, check divisibility by all prime numbers up to its square root.\n   - Keep a count of numbers that are determined to be prime.\n\n6. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure that both 3439 and 5566 are checked for primality as they are the boundaries of the range.\n\n7. **Counting the Primes**:\n   - Initialize a counter to zero.\n   - Increment the counter each time a prime number is found.\n\n8. **Final Count**:\n   - After checking all numbers in the range, the counter will reflect the total number of prime numbers.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the number of prime numbers between 3439 and 5566. After performing the calculations, we find that there are 276 prime numbers in this range.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<276>>>."
