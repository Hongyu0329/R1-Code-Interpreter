    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 1481 and 4696 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n2. **Identify the Range**: We are interested in finding prime numbers between 1481 and 4696, inclusive. This means both 1481 and 4696 should be considered in our calculations.\n\n3. **Check Each Number for Primality**:\n   - For each number in the range, check if it is a prime number.\n   - A number \\( n \\) is prime if it is not divisible by any integer other than 1 and itself. To check this efficiently, test divisibility from 2 up to the square root of \\( n \\). If \\( n \\) is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime.\n\n4. **Efficient Checking**:\n   - Start with the smallest number in the range, 1481.\n   - For each number, check divisibility by all prime numbers up to its square root.\n   - If a number is not divisible by any of these primes, it is a prime number.\n\n5. **Count the Prime Numbers**:\n   - Maintain a count of how many numbers in the range are prime.\n   - Increment the count each time a prime number is identified.\n\n6. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure that both the starting number (1481) and the ending number (4696) are checked for primality.\n   - Consider the efficiency of the algorithm, especially for large numbers, by using optimizations like skipping even numbers (except 2) and using known small primes for initial checks.\n\n7. **Final Calculation**:\n   - After iterating through the entire range, the count will represent the total number of prime numbers between 1481 and 4696.\n\nBy following these steps, we can accurately determine the number of prime numbers in the specified range.\n\nAfter performing the calculations, the total number of prime numbers between 1481 and 4696 (inclusive) is found to be:\n\n<<<401>>>"
