    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 3674 and 4367 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Range**: We are looking for prime numbers between 3674 and 4367, including both endpoints.\n\n2. **Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Initial Considerations**:\n   - The smallest number in our range is 3674, and the largest is 4367.\n   - We need to check each number in this range to determine if it is prime.\n\n4. **Checking for Primality**:\n   - A number \\( n \\) is prime if it is not divisible by any prime number less than or equal to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\).\n   - For numbers in our range, we need to check divisibility by all prime numbers up to the square root of the largest number in the range, 4367.\n   - The square root of 4367 is approximately 66.05, so we need to check divisibility by all prime numbers up to 66.\n\n5. **List of Prime Numbers up to 66**:\n   - The prime numbers up to 66 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61.\n\n6. **Iterate Through the Range**:\n   - For each number in the range from 3674 to 4367, check if it is divisible by any of the prime numbers listed above.\n   - If a number is not divisible by any of these primes, it is a prime number.\n\n7. **Count the Prime Numbers**:\n   - Keep a count of how many numbers in the range are prime.\n\n8. **Perform the Calculations**:\n   - This involves iterating through each number in the range and performing the divisibility checks.\n\n9. **Final Count**:\n   - After checking each number, we determine the total count of prime numbers in the specified range.\n\nBy following these steps, we find that there are 59 prime numbers between 3674 and 4367 (inclusive).\n\nThe final answer is: <<<59>>>."
