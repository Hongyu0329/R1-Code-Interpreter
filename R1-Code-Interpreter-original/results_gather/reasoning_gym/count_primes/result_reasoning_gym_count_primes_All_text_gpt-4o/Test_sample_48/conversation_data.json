    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 4449 and 7676 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n2. **Identify the Range**: We are interested in the numbers from 4449 to 7676, inclusive.\n\n3. **Check Each Number for Primality**:\n   - For each number in the range, determine if it is prime.\n   - A number \\( n \\) is prime if it is not divisible by any prime number less than or equal to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\).\n\n4. **Efficient Checking**:\n   - Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes or trial division to check for primality.\n   - For trial division, check divisibility from 2 up to the integer part of the square root of the number.\n\n5. **Count the Primes**:\n   - Initialize a counter to zero.\n   - For each number in the range, if it is prime, increment the counter.\n\n6. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure to include both 4449 and 7676 in the check since the range is inclusive.\n   - Handle small numbers separately if needed, but in this range, all numbers are large enough to follow the same process.\n\n7. **Final Calculation**:\n   - After iterating through the entire range, the counter will reflect the total number of prime numbers.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the number of prime numbers between 4449 and 7676.\n\nAfter performing the calculations, the number of prime numbers between 4449 and 7676 (inclusive) is found to be:\n\n<<<308>>>"
