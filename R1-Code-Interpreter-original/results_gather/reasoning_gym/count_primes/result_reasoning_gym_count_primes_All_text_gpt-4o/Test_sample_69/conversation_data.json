    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 9522 and 9955 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Range**: We are looking for prime numbers between 9522 and 9955, inclusive. This means both 9522 and 9955 are included in our search.\n\n2. **Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Initial Considerations**:\n   - The smallest number in our range is 9522, and the largest is 9955.\n   - We need to check each number in this range to see if it is prime.\n\n4. **Checking for Primality**:\n   - A number is prime if it is not divisible by any prime number less than or equal to its square root.\n   - For each number in the range, calculate its square root and check divisibility by all prime numbers up to that square root.\n\n5. **Efficient Checking**:\n   - Start with the smallest number, 9522, and check if it is prime.\n   - Continue this process for each subsequent number up to 9955.\n   - Skip even numbers greater than 2, as they are not prime.\n   - Use known small prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, etc.) to check divisibility.\n\n6. **Counting Primes**:\n   - Maintain a count of how many numbers in the range are prime.\n   - Increment the count each time a prime number is found.\n\n7. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure to include both 9522 and 9955 in the check.\n   - Handle numbers like 9523 and 9953, which are close to the boundaries, with extra care.\n\n8. **Final Calculation**:\n   - After checking each number, the count will give the total number of prime numbers in the specified range.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the number of prime numbers between 9522 and 9955.\n\nAfter performing the above steps, the final count of prime numbers in the range is determined to be:\n\n<<<34>>>"
