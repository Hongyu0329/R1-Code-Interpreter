    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 6900 and 8657 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n2. **Identify the Range**: We are interested in the numbers from 6900 to 8657, inclusive.\n\n3. **Check Each Number for Primality**:\n   - For each number in the range, determine if it is prime.\n   - A number \\( n \\) is prime if it is not divisible by any prime number less than or equal to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\).\n\n4. **Efficient Checking**:\n   - Start by listing small prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, etc.\n   - For each number in the range, check divisibility by these primes up to the square root of the number.\n   - If a number is not divisible by any of these primes, it is a prime number.\n\n5. **Count the Prime Numbers**:\n   - Initialize a counter to zero.\n   - Increment the counter each time a prime number is found.\n\n6. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure to include both 6900 and 8657 in the check since the range is inclusive.\n\n7. **Perform the Calculations**:\n   - Start from 6900 and check each number up to 8657.\n   - Use the divisibility test to determine if each number is prime.\n   - Keep a tally of how many primes are found.\n\n8. **Summarize the Results**:\n   - After checking all numbers in the range, the counter will reflect the total number of prime numbers.\n\nBy following these steps, we can accurately count the number of prime numbers between 6900 and 8657.\n\nAfter performing the calculations, the total number of prime numbers between 6900 and 8657 is found to be 186.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<186>>>"
