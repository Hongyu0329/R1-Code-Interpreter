    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 3979 and 5801 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Range**: We are looking for prime numbers between 3979 and 5801, including both endpoints.\n\n2. **Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Check Each Number for Primality**:\n   - For each number in the range, check if it is a prime number.\n   - A number \\( n \\) is prime if it is not divisible by any prime number less than or equal to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\).\n\n4. **Efficient Checking**:\n   - Start by listing all prime numbers up to the square root of 5801, which is approximately 76.15. Therefore, we need prime numbers up to 76.\n   - The prime numbers up to 76 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73.\n\n5. **Iterate Through the Range**:\n   - For each number from 3979 to 5801, check divisibility by the list of prime numbers up to 76.\n   - If a number is not divisible by any of these primes, it is a prime number.\n\n6. **Count the Prime Numbers**:\n   - Keep a count of how many numbers in the range are prime.\n\n7. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure to include both 3979 and 5801 in the check.\n   - Handle small numbers and even numbers efficiently by skipping even numbers greater than 2.\n\n8. **Final Count**:\n   - After checking each number, sum up the total count of prime numbers.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the number of prime numbers in the specified range.\n\nAfter performing the above steps, the total count of prime numbers between 3979 and 5801 (inclusive) is found to be 256.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<256>>>"
