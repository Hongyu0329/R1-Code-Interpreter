    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 4647 and 4952 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Range**: We are looking for prime numbers between 4647 and 4952, inclusive. This means we need to check each number from 4647 to 4952 to see if it is prime.\n\n2. **Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. This means a prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors.\n\n3. **Checking for Primality**:\n   - For each number in the range, we need to check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.\n   - A number \\( n \\) is not prime if it can be divided evenly by any integer from 2 up to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\). If no such divisor exists, the number is prime.\n\n4. **Iterate Through the Range**:\n   - Start from 4647 and go up to 4952.\n   - For each number, check divisibility from 2 up to its square root.\n   - If a number is not divisible by any of these, it is prime.\n\n5. **Count the Primes**:\n   - Keep a count of how many numbers in the range are prime.\n\n6. **Perform the Calculations**:\n   - Check each number one by one:\n     - 4647: Not prime (divisible by 3)\n     - 4648: Not prime (even number)\n     - 4649: Prime\n     - 4650: Not prime (even number)\n     - 4651: Not prime (divisible by 3)\n     - 4652: Not prime (even number)\n     -
