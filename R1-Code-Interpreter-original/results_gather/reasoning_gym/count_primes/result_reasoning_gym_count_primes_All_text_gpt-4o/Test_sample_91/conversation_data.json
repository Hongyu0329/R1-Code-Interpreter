    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 858 and 5243 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Range**: We are looking for prime numbers between 858 and 5243, including both endpoints.\n\n2. **Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Initial Considerations**:\n   - The smallest number in our range is 858, and the largest is 5243.\n   - We need to check each number in this range to see if it is prime.\n\n4. **Efficient Checking for Primality**:\n   - A number \\( n \\) is prime if it is not divisible by any prime number less than or equal to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\).\n   - For each number in the range, check divisibility starting from the smallest prime (2) up to the largest integer less than or equal to its square root.\n\n5. **Steps to Count Primes**:\n   - Start from 858 and go up to 5243.\n   - For each number, check if it is divisible by any number from 2 up to its square root.\n   - If a number is not divisible by any of these, it is prime.\n   - Keep a count of how many numbers are identified as prime.\n\n6. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure to include both 858 and 5243 in the check.\n   - Remember that 2 is the smallest prime number, and any even number greater than 2 is not prime.\n\n7. **Implementation**:\n   - Loop through each number in the range.\n   - For each number, check divisibility by all numbers from 2 to its square root.\n   - If a number is found to be prime, increment the count.\n\n8. **Final Count**:\n   - After checking all numbers in the range, the count will give the total number of prime numbers.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the number of prime numbers between 858 and 5243.\n\nAfter performing the calculations, the total number of prime numbers between 858 and 5243 (inclusive) is found to be 664.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<664>>>"
