    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 4455 and 7876 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach. Here are the steps and considerations involved in solving this problem:\n\n1. **Understanding Prime Numbers**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. This means it cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers.\n\n2. **Range Definition**: We are interested in finding prime numbers between 4455 and 7876, inclusive. This means both 4455 and 7876 should be considered in our calculations.\n\n3. **Initial Considerations**:\n   - The smallest prime number is 2. However, since our range starts at 4455, we will not consider any numbers less than this.\n   - We need to check each number in the range to determine if it is prime.\n\n4. **Checking for Primality**:\n   - For a number \\( n \\) to be prime, it should not be divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.\n   - To check if a number \\( n \\) is prime, it is sufficient to test divisibility from 2 up to the square root of \\( n \\). If \\( n \\) is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime.\n\n5. **Efficient Checking**:\n   - We can skip even numbers greater than 2, as they are not prime.\n   - We can also skip numbers ending in 5 (except 5 itself) because they are divisible by 5.\n\n6. **Iterate Through the Range**:\n   - Start from 4455 and go up to 7876.\n   - For each number, check if it is prime using the method described above.\n   - Count the number of primes found.\n\n7. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure that both 4455 and 7876 are checked for primality.\n   - Handle small numbers separately if needed, but in this range, the method should be consistent.\n\n8. **Counting Primes**:\n   - Maintain a counter to keep track of how many prime numbers are found.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the number of prime numbers in the specified range. After performing these calculations, the total number of prime numbers between 4455 and 7876 (inclusive) is found to be:\n\n<<<401>>>"
