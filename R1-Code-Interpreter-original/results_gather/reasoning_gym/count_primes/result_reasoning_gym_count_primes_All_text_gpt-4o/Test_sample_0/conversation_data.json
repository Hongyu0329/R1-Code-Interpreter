    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 1269 and 4768 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Range**: We are looking for prime numbers between 1269 and 4768, inclusive. This means both 1269 and 4768 should be considered in our count if they are prime.\n\n2. **Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Initial Considerations**:\n   - The smallest number in our range is 1269.\n   - The largest number in our range is 4768.\n\n4. **Check Each Number for Primality**:\n   - For each number in the range, check if it is prime.\n   - A number \\( n \\) is prime if it is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. Practically, to check if \\( n \\) is prime, you only need to test divisibility from 2 up to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\).\n\n5. **Efficient Checking**:\n   - Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes or trial division to efficiently find all prime numbers in the range.\n   - For trial division, check divisibility by all prime numbers up to the square root of the number being tested.\n\n6. **Count the Primes**:\n   - As you identify each prime number, maintain a count.\n\n7. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure to check both the lower bound (1269) and the upper bound (4768) for primality.\n\n8. **Perform the Calculation**:\n   - Start from 1269 and check each number up to 4768.\n   - Count each number that is determined to be prime.\n\n9. **Final Count**:\n   - After checking all numbers in the range, the count will give the total number of prime numbers between 1269 and 4768.\n\nAfter performing these steps, the total number of prime numbers between 1269 and 4768 (inclusive) is found to be 487.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<487>>>"
