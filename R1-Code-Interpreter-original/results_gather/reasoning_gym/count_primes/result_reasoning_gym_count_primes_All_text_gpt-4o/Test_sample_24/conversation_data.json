    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 9172 and 9183 (inclusive), we need to analyze each number within this range and check if it is a prime number. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\nLet's go through each number step by step:\n\n1. **9172**: \n   - Check divisibility by 2: 9172 is even, so it is divisible by 2. \n   - Therefore, 9172 is not a prime number.\n\n2. **9173**: \n   - Check divisibility by 2: 9173 is odd, so not divisible by 2.\n   - Check divisibility by 3: Sum of digits (9 + 1 + 7 + 3 = 20) is not divisible by 3.\n   - Check divisibility by 5: Last digit is not 0 or 5.\n   - Check divisibility by 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89: None of these divide 9173 evenly.\n   - Therefore, 9173 is a prime number.\n\n3. **9174**: \n   - Check divisibility by 2: 9174 is even, so it is divisible by 2.\n   - Therefore, 9174 is not a prime number.\n\n4. **9175**: \n   - Check divisibility by 2: 9175 is odd, so not divisible by 2.\n   - Check divisibility by 3: Sum of digits (9 + 1 + 7 + 5 = 22) is not divisible by 3.\n   - Check divisibility by 5: Last digit is 5, so it is divisible by 5.\n   - Therefore, 9175 is not a prime number.\n\n5. **9176**: \n   - Check divisibility by 2: 9176 is even, so it is divisible by 2.\n   - Therefore, 9176 is not a prime number.\n\n6. **9177**: \n   - Check divisibility by 2: 9177 is odd, so not divisible by 2.\n   - Check divisibility by 3: Sum of digits (9 + 1 + 7 + 7 = 24) is divisible by 3.\n   - Therefore, 9177 is not a prime number.\n\n7. **9178**: \n   - Check divisibility by 2: 9178 is even, so it is divisible by 2.\n   - Therefore, 9178 is not a prime number.\n\n8. **9179**: \n   - Check divisibility by 2: 9179 is odd, so not divisible by 2.\n   - Check divisibility by 3: Sum of digits (9 + 1 + 7 + 9 = 26) is not divisible by 3.\n   - Check divisibility by 5: Last digit is not 0 or 5.\n   - Check divisibility by 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89: None of these divide 9179 evenly.\n   - Therefore, 9179 is a prime number.\n\n9. **9180**: \n   - Check divisibility by 2: 9180 is even, so it is divisible by 2.\n   - Therefore, 9180 is not a prime number.\n\n10. **9181**: \n    - Check divisibility by 2: 9181 is odd, so not divisible by 2.\n    - Check divisibility by 3: Sum of digits (9 + 1 + 8 + 1 = 19) is not divisible by 3.\n    - Check divisibility by 5: Last digit is not 0 or 5.\n    - Check divisibility by 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89: None of these divide 9181 evenly.\n    - Therefore, 9181 is a prime number.\n\n11. **9182**: \n    - Check divisibility by 2: 9182 is even, so it is divisible by 2.\n    - Therefore, 9182 is not a prime number.\n\n12. **9183**: \n    - Check divisibility by 2: 9183 is odd, so not divisible by 2.\n    - Check divisibility by 3: Sum of digits (9 + 1 + 8 + 3 = 21) is divisible by 3.\n    - Therefore, 9183 is not a prime number.\n\nAfter analyzing each number, we find that the prime numbers in this range are 9173, 9179, and 9181.\n\nThus, there are 3 prime numbers between 9172 and 9183 (inclusive).\n\nFinal answer: <<<3>>>."
