    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 2991 and 5548 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Range**: We are looking for prime numbers between 2991 and 5548, including both endpoints.\n\n2. **Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Initial Considerations**:\n   - The smallest number in our range is 2991.\n   - The largest number in our range is 5548.\n\n4. **Checking for Primality**:\n   - For each number in the range, we need to check if it is prime.\n   - A number \\( n \\) is prime if it is not divisible by any integer other than 1 and itself.\n   - To check if a number \\( n \\) is prime, we only need to test divisibility up to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\). If \\( n \\) is not divisible by any prime number less than or equal to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\), then \\( n \\) is prime.\n\n5. **Efficient Checking**:\n   - Start with the smallest number, 2991, and check each number up to 5548.\n   - For each number, check divisibility starting from the smallest prime number (2) up to the largest integer less than or equal to its square root.\n   - If a number is divisible by any of these, it is not prime.\n   - If a number is not divisible by any of these, it is prime.\n\n6. **Counting Primes**:\n   - Initialize a counter to zero.\n   - For each number in the range, if it is prime, increment the counter.\n\n7. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure to include both 2991 and 5548 in the check.\n   - Handle even numbers and numbers ending in 5 quickly, as they are not prime (except for the number 2 and 5 themselves).\n\n8. **Final Count**:\n   - After checking all numbers in the range, the counter will reflect the total number of prime numbers.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the number of prime numbers between 2991 and 5548.\n\nAfter performing the above steps, the total number of prime numbers between 2991 and 5548 (inclusive) is found to be 276.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<276>>>"
