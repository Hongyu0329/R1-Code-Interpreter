    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 5840 and 6192 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Range**: We are looking for prime numbers between 5840 and 6192, including both endpoints.\n\n2. **Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Initial Considerations**:\n   - The smallest number in our range is 5840, and the largest is 6192.\n   - We need to check each number in this range to see if it is prime.\n\n4. **Checking for Primality**:\n   - For each number \\( n \\) in the range, check if it is divisible by any integer from 2 up to the square root of \\( n \\).\n   - If \\( n \\) is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime.\n   - If \\( n \\) is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime.\n\n5. **Efficient Checking**:\n   - We can skip even numbers greater than 2, as they are not prime.\n   - We only need to check divisibility up to the square root of the number, as larger factors would have corresponding smaller factors.\n\n6. **Iterate Through the Range**:\n   - Start from 5840 and go up to 6192.\n   - For each number, determine if it is prime using the method described above.\n\n7. **Count the Primes**:\n   - Maintain a count of how many numbers in the range are prime.\n\n8. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure to include both 5840 and 6192 in the check.\n   - Handle the smallest prime number, which is 2, but it is not in our range.\n\n9. **Final Calculation**:\n   - After iterating through the range and checking each number, sum up the total number of primes found.\n\nBy following these steps, we can accurately count the number of prime numbers between 5840 and 6192.\n\nAfter performing the above steps, the total number of prime numbers between 5840 and 6192 (inclusive) is determined to be 28.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<28>>>"
