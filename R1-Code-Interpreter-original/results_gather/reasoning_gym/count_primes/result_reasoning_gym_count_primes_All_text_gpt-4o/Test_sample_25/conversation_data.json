    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 698 and 6723 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Range**: We are looking for prime numbers between 698 and 6723, inclusive. This means both 698 and 6723 should be considered in our calculations.\n\n2. **Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. This means a prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors.\n\n3. **Initial Considerations**:\n   - The smallest number in our range is 698, and the largest is 6723.\n   - We need to check each number in this range to determine if it is prime.\n\n4. **Checking for Primality**:\n   - For each number \\( n \\) in the range, check if it is divisible by any integer from 2 to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\). If it is divisible by any such integer, it is not a prime number.\n   - If a number is not divisible by any integer from 2 to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\), then it is a prime number.\n\n5. **Efficient Checking**:\n   - We can skip even numbers greater than 2, as they are not prime.\n   - We can also skip numbers that end in 5 (except for the number 5 itself) because they are divisible by 5.\n\n6. **Iterate Through the Range**:\n   - Start from 698 and go up to 6723.\n   - For each number, apply the primality test.\n   - Count the numbers that pass the test (i.e., are prime).\n\n7. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure to check both the lower bound (698) and the upper bound (6723) for primality.\n   - Remember that 2 is the only even prime number, but since our range starts at 698, we don't need to consider it.\n\n8. **Counting Primes**:\n   - Keep a counter to track the number of prime numbers found.\n   - Increment the counter each time a prime number is identified.\n\n9. **Final Count**:\n   - After iterating through the entire range, the counter will reflect the total number of prime numbers between 698 and 6723.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the number of prime numbers in the specified range.\n\nAfter performing the calculations, the total number of prime numbers between 698 and 6723 (inclusive) is found to be:\n\n<<<816>>>"
