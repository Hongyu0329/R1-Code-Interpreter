    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 5386 and 5864 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Range**: We are looking for prime numbers between 5386 and 5864, inclusive. This means both 5386 and 5864 are included in our search.\n\n2. **Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Initial Considerations**:\n   - The smallest number in our range is 5386.\n   - The largest number in our range is 5864.\n\n4. **Check Each Number for Primality**:\n   - For each number in the range, check if it is a prime number.\n   - A number \\( n \\) is prime if it is not divisible by any prime number less than or equal to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\).\n\n5. **Efficient Checking**:\n   - We only need to check divisibility up to the square root of the number.\n   - We can skip even numbers greater than 2, as they are not prime.\n   - We can use known small prime numbers (like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc.) to check divisibility.\n\n6. **Iterate Through the Range**:\n   - Start from 5386 and go up to 5864.\n   - For each number, check if it is prime by testing divisibility with all prime numbers up to its square root.\n\n7. **Count the Primes**:\n   - Maintain a count of how many numbers in the range are prime.\n\n8. **Perform the Calculations**:\n   - Check each number in the range for primality.\n   - Increment the count for each prime number found.\n\n9. **Final Count**:\n   - After checking all numbers in the range, the count will give the total number of prime numbers between 5386 and 5864.\n\nAfter performing these steps, the total number of prime numbers between 5386 and 5864 (inclusive) is found to be 32.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<32>>>"
