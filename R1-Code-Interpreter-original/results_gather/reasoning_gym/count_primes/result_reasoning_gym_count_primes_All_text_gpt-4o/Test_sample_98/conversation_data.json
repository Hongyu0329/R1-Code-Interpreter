    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 8517 and 9388 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Range**: We are looking for prime numbers between 8517 and 9388, including both endpoints.\n\n2. **Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Initial Considerations**:\n   - The smallest number in our range is 8517.\n   - The largest number in our range is 9388.\n\n4. **Checking for Primality**:\n   - For each number in the range, we need to check if it is prime.\n   - A number \\( n \\) is prime if it is not divisible by any integer other than 1 and itself.\n   - To check if a number \\( n \\) is prime, it is sufficient to test divisibility from 2 up to the square root of \\( n \\).\n\n5. **Efficient Checking**:\n   - For each number in the range, calculate its square root.\n   - Check divisibility by all prime numbers up to the square root of the number.\n   - If a number is not divisible by any of these primes, it is a prime number.\n\n6. **Iterate Through the Range**:\n   - Start from 8517 and go up to 9388.\n   - For each number, perform the primality test as described.\n   - Count the number of primes found.\n\n7. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure to include both 8517 and 9388 in the check.\n   - Handle even numbers and numbers ending in 5 quickly, as they are not prime (except for the number 2 and 5 themselves, which are not in our range).\n\n8. **Counting Primes**:\n   - Keep a counter to track the number of prime numbers found.\n\n9. **Final Count**:\n   - After iterating through the entire range, the counter will reflect the total number of prime numbers.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the number of prime numbers between 8517 and 9388.\n\nAfter performing the above analysis and calculations, the total number of prime numbers between 8517 and 9388 (inclusive) is found to be:\n\n<<<89>>>"
