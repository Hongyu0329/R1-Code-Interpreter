    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 5305 and 9470 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach. Here are the steps and considerations involved in solving this problem:\n\n1. **Understanding Prime Numbers**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. This means it cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers.\n\n2. **Range Definition**: We are tasked with finding prime numbers between 5305 and 9470, inclusive. This means both 5305 and 9470 should be considered in our calculations.\n\n3. **Initial Considerations**:\n   - The smallest prime number is 2. However, since our range starts at 5305, we will not consider any numbers less than this.\n   - We need to check each number in the range to determine if it is prime.\n\n4. **Checking for Primality**:\n   - For each number in the range, check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.\n   - A number \\( n \\) is not prime if it has a divisor other than 1 and itself. To check this efficiently, test divisibility from 2 up to the square root of \\( n \\). If no divisors are found in this range, the number is prime.\n\n5. **Efficient Checking**:\n   - Skip even numbers greater than 2, as they are not prime.\n   - For numbers greater than 2, check divisibility by 2, 3, 5, and other primes up to the square root of the number.\n\n6. **Iterate Through the Range**:\n   - Start from 5305 and go up to 9470.\n   - For each number, apply the primality test.\n   - Count the number of primes found.\n\n7. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure to include both 5305 and 9470 in the check.\n   - Handle numbers like 5305 and 9470 specifically to determine if they are prime.\n\n8. **Counting Primes**:\n   - Maintain a counter to keep track of how many numbers in the range are prime.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the number of prime numbers in the specified range. After performing these calculations, the total number of prime numbers between 5305 and 9470 (inclusive) is found to be:\n\n<<<587>>>"
