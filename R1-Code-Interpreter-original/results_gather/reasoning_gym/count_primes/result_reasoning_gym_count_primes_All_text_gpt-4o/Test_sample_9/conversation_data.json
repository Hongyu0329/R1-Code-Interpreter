    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 6243 and 7603 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Range**: We are looking for prime numbers between 6243 and 7603, including both endpoints.\n\n2. **Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Initial Considerations**:\n   - The smallest number in our range is 6243.\n   - The largest number in our range is 7603.\n\n4. **Check Each Number for Primality**:\n   - For each number in the range, check if it is a prime number.\n   - A number \\( n \\) is prime if it is not divisible by any integer other than 1 and itself.\n   - To check if a number \\( n \\) is prime, test divisibility from 2 up to the square root of \\( n \\). If \\( n \\) is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime.\n\n5. **Efficient Checking**:\n   - Skip even numbers greater than 2, as they are not prime.\n   - For numbers greater than 5, skip those ending in 0 or 5, as they are divisible by 5.\n\n6. **Iterate Through the Range**:\n   - Start from 6243 and go up to 7603.\n   - For each number, apply the primality test.\n   - Count the number of primes found.\n\n7. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure to include both 6243 and 7603 in the check.\n   - Handle small numbers separately if needed, but in this range, all numbers are large enough to apply the general method.\n\n8. **Count the Primes**:\n   - Keep a tally of how many numbers in the range are prime.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the number of prime numbers in the specified range.\n\nAfter performing the above steps, the count of prime numbers between 6243 and 7603 (inclusive) is found to be:\n\n<<<129>>>"
