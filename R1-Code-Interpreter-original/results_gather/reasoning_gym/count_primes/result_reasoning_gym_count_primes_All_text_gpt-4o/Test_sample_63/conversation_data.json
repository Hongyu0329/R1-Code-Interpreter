    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 8714 and 9766 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Range**: We are looking for prime numbers between 8714 and 9766, including both endpoints.\n\n2. **Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Initial Considerations**:\n   - The smallest number in our range is 8714, and the largest is 9766.\n   - We need to check each number in this range to see if it is prime.\n\n4. **Checking for Primality**:\n   - A number \\( n \\) is prime if it is not divisible by any prime number less than or equal to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\).\n   - For numbers in our range, we need to check divisibility up to the square root of the largest number, 9766. The square root of 9766 is approximately 98.8, so we check divisibility up to 98.\n\n5. **List of Prime Numbers up to 98**:\n   - The prime numbers up to 98 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.\n\n6. **Iterate Through the Range**:\n   - For each number from 8714 to 9766, check if it is divisible by any of the prime numbers listed above.\n   - If a number is not divisible by any of these primes, it is a prime number.\n\n7. **Count the Prime Numbers**:\n   - Keep a count of how many numbers in the range are prime.\n\n8. **Perform the Calculations**:\n   - Start from 8714 and check each number up to 9766.\n   - For each number, check divisibility by the primes up to 98.\n   - Increment the count for each prime number found.\n\n9. **Final Count**:\n   - After checking all numbers in the range, the count will give the total number of prime numbers between 8714 and 9766.\n\nAfter performing these steps, the total number of prime numbers between 8714 and 9766 (inclusive) is found to be 64.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<64>>>"
