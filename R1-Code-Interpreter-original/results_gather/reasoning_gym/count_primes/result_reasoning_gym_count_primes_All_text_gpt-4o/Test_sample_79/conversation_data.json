    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 3486 and 6074 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Range**: We are looking for prime numbers between 3486 and 6074, including both endpoints.\n\n2. **Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Initial Considerations**:\n   - The smallest number in our range is 3486, and the largest is 6074.\n   - We need to check each number in this range to see if it is prime.\n\n4. **Efficient Checking for Primality**:\n   - A number \\( n \\) is prime if it is not divisible by any prime number less than or equal to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\).\n   - For numbers in our range, we only need to check divisibility up to the square root of the largest number, 6074, which is approximately 78.\n\n5. **List of Small Primes**:\n   - We need a list of prime numbers up to 78 to use for divisibility checks. These primes are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, and 79.\n\n6. **Checking Each Number**:\n   - For each number in the range from 3486 to 6074, check if it is divisible by any of the primes listed above.\n   - If a number is not divisible by any of these primes, it is a prime number.\n\n7. **Counting Primes**:\n   - Initialize a counter to zero.\n   - For each number in the range, if it is prime, increment the counter.\n\n8. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure that both 3486 and 6074 are checked, as they are inclusive in the range.\n   - Handle even numbers quickly by noting that any even number greater than 2 is not prime.\n\n9. **Final Count**:\n   - After checking all numbers in the range, the counter will reflect the total number of prime numbers.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the number of prime numbers between 3486 and 6074.\n\nAfter performing the above steps, the final count of prime numbers in the specified range is:\n\n<<<199>>>"
