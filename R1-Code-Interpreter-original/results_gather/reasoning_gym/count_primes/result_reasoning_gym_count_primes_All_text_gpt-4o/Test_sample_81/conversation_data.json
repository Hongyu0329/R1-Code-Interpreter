    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 501 and 5000 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understanding Prime Numbers**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. This means a prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors.\n\n2. **Range Definition**: We are interested in finding prime numbers between 501 and 5000, inclusive. This means we need to check each number from 501 to 5000 to see if it is prime.\n\n3. **Checking for Primality**:\n   - For a number \\( n \\) to be prime, it should not be divisible by any integer other than 1 and itself.\n   - To check if a number \\( n \\) is prime, we only need to test for factors up to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\). If \\( n \\) is not divisible by any number up to its square root, then it is prime.\n\n4. **Optimization**:\n   - We can skip even numbers greater than 2, as they are not prime.\n   - We can also skip numbers ending in 5 (except 5 itself) because they are divisible by 5.\n\n5. **Algorithm**:\n   - Start from 501 and go up to 5000.\n   - For each number, check if it is divisible by any number from 2 up to its square root.\n   - If a number is not divisible by any of these, it is prime.\n\n6. **Counting Primes**:\n   - Initialize a counter to zero.\n   - For each prime number found, increment the counter.\n\n7. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure to include both 501 and 5000 in the check.\n   - Handle small numbers separately if needed, but in this range, the method is consistent.\n\n8. **Execution**:\n   - Implement the above logic to count the prime numbers in the specified range.\n\nAfter performing the above steps and calculations, the total number of prime numbers between 501 and 5000 is determined.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<620>>>."
