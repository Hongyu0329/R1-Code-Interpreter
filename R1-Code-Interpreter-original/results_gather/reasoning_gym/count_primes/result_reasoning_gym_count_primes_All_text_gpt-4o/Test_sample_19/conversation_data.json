    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 3990 and 8104 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n2. **Identify the Range**: We are interested in the numbers from 3990 to 8104, inclusive. This means we need to check each number in this range to see if it is prime.\n\n3. **Check Each Number for Primality**:\n   - For each number \\( n \\) in the range, check if it is divisible by any integer from 2 up to the square root of \\( n \\). If it is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime.\n   - If a number is not divisible by any of these, it is prime.\n\n4. **Efficient Checking**:\n   - We can skip even numbers greater than 2, as they are not prime.\n   - We can also skip numbers that end in 5 (except for the number 5 itself), as they are divisible by 5.\n\n5. **Count the Prime Numbers**:\n   - Initialize a counter to zero.\n   - For each number in the range, if it is prime, increment the counter.\n\n6. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure to include both 3990 and 8104 in the check since the range is inclusive.\n   - Handle small numbers separately if needed, but in this range, the smallest number is 3990, which is not prime.\n\n7. **Perform the Calculation**:\n   - Start from 3990 and go up to 8104, checking each number for primality and counting the primes.\n\n8. **Output the Result**:\n   - After checking all numbers in the range, the counter will hold the total number of prime numbers.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the number of prime numbers in the specified range.\n\nAfter performing the above steps, the final count of prime numbers between 3990 and 8104 (inclusive) is:\n\n<<<548>>>"
