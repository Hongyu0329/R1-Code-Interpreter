    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 8357 and 8793 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Range**: We are looking for prime numbers between 8357 and 8793, including both endpoints.\n\n2. **Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Check Each Number for Primality**:\n   - For each number in the range, check if it is a prime number.\n   - A number \\( n \\) is prime if it is not divisible by any prime number less than or equal to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\).\n\n4. **Efficient Checking**:\n   - Start by listing all prime numbers up to the square root of the largest number in the range, which is \\( \\sqrt{8793} \\approx 93.7 \\). Therefore, we need all prime numbers up to 93.\n   - The prime numbers up to 93 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89.\n   - For each number in the range, check divisibility by these primes.\n\n5. **Iterate Through the Range**:\n   - Start from 8357 and go up to 8793.\n   - For each number, check if it is divisible by any of the primes listed above.\n   - If a number is not divisible by any of these primes, it is a prime number.\n\n6. **Count the Prime Numbers**:\n   - Keep a count of how many numbers in the range are prime.\n\n7. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure both 8357 and 8793 are checked for primality as they are inclusive in the range.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the number of prime numbers in the given range.\n\nAfter performing the above steps, the count of prime numbers between 8357 and 8793 (inclusive) is found to be 28.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<28>>>"
