    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 9828 and 9967 (inclusive), we need to follow a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Range**: We are looking for prime numbers between 9828 and 9967, inclusive. This means both 9828 and 9967 are included in our search.\n\n2. **Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Initial Considerations**:\n   - Since 9828 is even, it is not a prime number.\n   - We can skip all even numbers in this range except for 2, but since 2 is not in our range, we skip all even numbers.\n\n4. **Check for Primality**:\n   - For each odd number in the range, check if it is a prime number.\n   - To check if a number \\( n \\) is prime, test divisibility from 2 up to the square root of \\( n \\). If \\( n \\) is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime.\n\n5. **List of Numbers to Check**:\n   - Start from 9829 (since 9828 is even) and check each odd number up to 9967.\n\n6. **Perform the Primality Test**:\n   - For each odd number, check divisibility by all odd numbers up to its square root.\n   - If a number is not divisible by any of these, it is prime.\n\n7. **Count the Primes**:\n   - Keep a count of how many numbers are identified as prime.\n\n8. **Perform the Calculations**:\n   - Check each number manually or use a systematic method to ensure accuracy.\n\n9. **List of Prime Numbers Found**:\n   - After checking each number, list the primes found in the range.\n\n10. **Final Count**:\n    - Count the total number of primes identified.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the number of prime numbers in the specified range.\n\nAfter performing the above steps, the prime numbers between 9828 and 9967 are: 9829, 9833, 9839, 9851, 9857, 9859, 9871, 9883, 9887, 9901, 9907, 9923, 9929, 9931, 9941, 9949, 9967.\n\nTherefore, the total number of prime numbers in this range is 17.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<17>>>."
