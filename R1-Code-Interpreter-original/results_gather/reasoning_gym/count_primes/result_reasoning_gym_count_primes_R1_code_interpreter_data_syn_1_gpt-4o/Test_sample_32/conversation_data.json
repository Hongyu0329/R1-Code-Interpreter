    "To solve the problem of counting how many prime numbers exist between 7802 and 8313 (inclusive), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n2. **Determine the Range**: We are interested in the numbers from 7802 to 8313, inclusive.\n\n3. **Check Each Number for Primality**: For each number in this range, we need to check if it is a prime number. This involves checking if the number is divisible by any integer other than 1 and itself.\n\n4. **Count the Prime Numbers**: We will maintain a count of how many numbers in this range are prime.\n\nTo efficiently check for primality, we can use the following approach:\n- For a given number `n`, check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `n`. If `n` is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is prime.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to count the prime numbers in the specified range.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef count_primes_in_range(start, end):\n    prime_count = 0\n    for num in range(start, end + 1):\n        if is_prime(num):\n            prime_count += 1\n    return prime_count\n\n# Define the range\nstart = 7802\nend = 8313\n\n# Count the prime numbers in the range\nprime_count = count_primes_in_range(start, end)\nprint(prime_count)\n```\n\nThis code will count the number of prime numbers between 7802 and 8313 and print the result. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
