    "To solve the problem of counting how many prime numbers exist between 1204 and 4255 (inclusive), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n2. **Iterate Through the Range**: We need to check each number in the range from 1204 to 4255 to determine if it is a prime number.\n\n3. **Check for Primality**: For each number, we will check if it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. A common method is to check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number.\n\n4. **Count the Primes**: We will maintain a count of how many numbers in the range are prime.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the number of prime numbers in the specified range.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef count_primes_in_range(start, end):\n    prime_count = 0\n    for num in range(start, end + 1):\n        if is_prime(num):\n            prime_count += 1\n    return prime_count\n\n# Define the range\nstart = 1204\nend = 4255\n\n# Count the prime numbers in the range\nprime_count = count_primes_in_range(start, end)\nprint(prime_count)\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `is_prime` to check if a number is prime and a function `count_primes_in_range` to count the number of prime numbers in the specified range. The result is printed at the end.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the output `386`, which indicates that there are 386 prime numbers between 1204 and 4255 (inclusive).\n\n<<<386>>>"
