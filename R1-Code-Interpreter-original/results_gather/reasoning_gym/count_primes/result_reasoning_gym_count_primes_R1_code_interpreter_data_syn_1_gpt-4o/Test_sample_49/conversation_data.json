    "To solve the problem of counting how many prime numbers exist between 8290 and 9218 (inclusive), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n2. **Iterate Through the Range**: We will iterate through each number in the range from 8290 to 9218.\n\n3. **Check for Primality**: For each number, we will check if it is a prime number. This can be done by checking divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number.\n\n4. **Count the Primes**: We will maintain a count of how many numbers in the range are prime.\n\n5. **Output the Result**: Finally, we will output the count of prime numbers.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python code to get the count of prime numbers in the specified range.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"Check if a number is prime.\"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef count_primes_in_range(start, end):\n    \"\"\"Count prime numbers in a given range [start, end].\"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    for num in range(start, end + 1):\n        if is_prime(num):\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\n# Define the range\nstart = 8290\nend = 9218\n\n# Count the prime numbers in the range\nprime_count = count_primes_in_range(start, end)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(prime_count)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the number of prime numbers between 8290 and 9218 and print the result. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the output, which indicates that there are 103 prime numbers between 8290 and 9218 (inclusive).\n\n<<<103>>>"
