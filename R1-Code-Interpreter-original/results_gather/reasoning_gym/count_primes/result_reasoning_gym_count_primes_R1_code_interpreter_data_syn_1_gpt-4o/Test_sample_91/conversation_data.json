    "To solve the problem of counting how many prime numbers exist between 858 and 5243 (inclusive), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Range**: We are looking for prime numbers between 858 and 5243, inclusive of both endpoints.\n\n2. **Definition of a Prime Number**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\n3. **Efficient Prime Checking**: To check if a number is prime, we can use the following approach:\n   - A number \\( n \\) is not prime if it is divisible by any number up to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\).\n   - We can skip even numbers greater than 2, as they are not prime.\n\n4. **Iterate and Count**: We will iterate through each number in the range and check if it is prime. If it is, we will increment our count.\n\n5. **Python Code Implementation**: We will write a Python script to perform the above steps and count the prime numbers in the specified range.\n\nLet's implement the code to find the solution:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef count_primes_in_range(start, end):\n    count = 0\n    for num in range(start, end + 1):\n        if is_prime(num):\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\n# Define the range\nstart = 858\nend = 5243\n\n# Count the prime numbers in the range\nprime_count = count_primes_in_range(start, end)\nprint(prime_count)\n```\n\nThis code will count the number of prime numbers between 858 and 5243, inclusive, and print the result. Let's execute the code to get the answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the number of prime numbers between 858 and 5243, inclusive. Based on the output, we can conclude the following:\n\n<<<549>>>"
