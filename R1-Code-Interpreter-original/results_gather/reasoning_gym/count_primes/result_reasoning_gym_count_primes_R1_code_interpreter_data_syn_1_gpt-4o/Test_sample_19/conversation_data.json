    "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of prime numbers between 3990 and 8104, inclusive. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\nThe approach to solve this problem involves:\n1. Iterating through each number in the range from 3990 to 8104.\n2. Checking if each number is a prime number.\n3. Counting the numbers that are prime.\n\nTo check if a number is prime, we can use the following method:\n- A number \\( n \\) is prime if it is not divisible by any number from 2 to \\(\\sqrt{n}\\).\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the count of prime numbers in the given range.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef count_primes_in_range(start, end):\n    count = 0\n    for num in range(start, end + 1):\n        if is_prime(num):\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\n# Count prime numbers between 3990 and 8104\nprime_count = count_primes_in_range(3990, 8104)\nprint(prime_count)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the number of prime numbers between 3990 and 8104. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the output, which indicates that there are 469 prime numbers between 3990 and 8104, inclusive.\n\n<<<469>>>"
