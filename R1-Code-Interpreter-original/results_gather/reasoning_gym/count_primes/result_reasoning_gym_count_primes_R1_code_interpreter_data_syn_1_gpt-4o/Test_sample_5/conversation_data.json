    "To determine how many prime numbers exist between 9958 and 9963 (inclusive), we need to check each number in this range to see if it is a prime number. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.\n\nThe numbers we need to check are: 9958, 9959, 9960, 9961, 9962, and 9963.\n\nWe will write a Python script to check each of these numbers for primality and count how many of them are prime.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"Check if a number is prime.\"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\n# List of numbers to check\nnumbers = range(9958, 9964)\n\n# Count prime numbers in the list\nprime_count = sum(1 for number in numbers if is_prime(number))\n\nprint(prime_count)\n```\n\nThis script defines a function `is_prime` to check if a number is prime and then uses it to count the prime numbers in the specified range. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
    "The code execution indicates that there are no prime numbers between 9958 and 9963. Let's verify this by considering each number:\n\n- 9958: Even number, not prime.\n- 9959: Divisible by 3 (sum of digits is 32, which is divisible by 3), not prime.\n- 9960: Even number, not prime.\n- 9961: Divisible by 7 (9961 รท 7 = 1423), not prime.\n- 9962: Even number, not prime.\n- 9963: Divisible by 3 (sum of digits is 27, which is divisible by 3), not prime.\n\nSince none of these numbers are prime, the result of 0 is correct.\n\n<<<0>>>"
