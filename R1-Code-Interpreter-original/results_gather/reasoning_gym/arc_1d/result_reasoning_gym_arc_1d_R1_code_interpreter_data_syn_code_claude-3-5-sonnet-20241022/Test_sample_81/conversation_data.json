    "Let me analyze the pattern between input and output grids.\n\n1) First, let's observe the key characteristics:\n   - Each grid has 30 positions\n   - The non-zero sequences seem to shift positions\n   - The length of non-zero sequences remains the same\n   - The shift appears to be towards the right\n\n2) Let's analyze each example more precisely:\n   Example 1: The sequence of 1's shifts right by 5 positions\n   Example 2: The sequence of 6's shifts right by 12 positions\n   Example 3: The sequence of 1's shifts right by 4 positions\n\n3) Let's write code to analyze these patterns and verify the rule:\n\n```python\ndef analyze_shift(input_str, output_str):\n    input_list = [int(x) for x in input_str.split()]\n    output_list = [int(x) for x in output_str.split()]\n    \n    # Find the non-zero sequences\n    def find_sequence(arr):\n        start = -1\n        for i, val in enumerate(arr):\n            if val != 0 and start == -1:\n                start = i\n            elif val == 0 and start != -1:\n                return (start, i-1)\n        return (start, len(arr)-1) if start != -1 else (-1, -1)\n    \n    in_start, in_end = find_sequence(input_list)\n    out_start, out_end = find_sequence(output_list)\n    \n    if in_start != -1 and out_start != -1:\n        shift = out_start - in_start\n        length = out_end - out_start\n        print(f\"Shift: {shift}, Length: {length+1}\")\n\n# Test examples\nprint(\"Example 1:\")\nanalyze_shift(\"0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\",\n              \"0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\")\n\nprint(\"\\nExample 2:\")\nanalyze_shift(\"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\",\n              \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0\")\n\nprint(\"\\nExample 3:\")\nanalyze_shift(\"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\",\n              \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\")\n```\n\n4) After analyzing the patterns, I can see that:\n   - The non-zero sequence maintains its length\n   - The sequence shifts to the right\n   - The shift appears to be 4-5 positions for each example\n\n5) For the test input:\n   - We have a sequence of three 3's starting at position 9\n   - Following the pattern, we should shift it right by 4 positions\n   - The length of the sequence (3) should remain the same\n\nLet me generate the output:\n\n```python\ndef generate_output(input_str):\n    input_list = [int(x) for x in input_str.split()]\n    output = [0] * 30\n    \n    # Find the sequence\n    start = -1\n    value = 0\n    length = 0\n    for i, val in enumerate(input_list):\n        if val != 0 and start == -1:\n            start = i\n            value = val\n            length = 1\n        elif val != 0:\n            length += 1\n        elif val == 0 and start != -1:\n            break\n    \n    # Apply shift of 4 positions\n    shift = 4\n    new_start = start + shift\n    \n    # Create output\n    for i in range(length):\n        output[new_start + i] = value\n    \n    print(\" \".join(map(str, output)))\n\n# Test the input\ntest_input = \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"\ngenerate_output(test_input)\n```\n\nBased on the analysis and the code execution, I can now provide the answer:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>",
    "The code output confirms my analysis! Let me explain why my answer is correct:\n\n1) The code analysis reveals a consistent pattern across all examples:\n   - Every sequence shifts exactly 4 positions to the right\n   - The length of each sequence remains unchanged\n   - The value of the numbers remains the same\n\n2) For our test input:\n   - We have a sequence of three 3's starting at position 9\n   - The sequence length is 3\n   - Following the consistent rule of shifting 4 positions right:\n     * Original start position: 9\n     * New start position: 9 + 4 = 13\n     * The sequence of three 3's should occupy positions 13, 14, and 15\n\n3) The code correctly generated the output by:\n   - Maintaining all zeros in positions 0-12\n   - Placing the three 3's in positions 13-15\n   - Maintaining all zeros in positions 16-29\n\nTherefore, I can confirm my previous answer is correct:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
