    "Let me analyze this pattern step by step.\n\n1) First, let's observe the patterns in the examples:\n   - Example 1: 000294340 -> 292344000\n   - Example 2: 000044110 -> 044211000\n   - Example 3: 000794100 -> 794910000\n\n2) Key observations:\n   - All outputs seem to shift non-zero numbers to the left\n   - Zeros are moved to the right\n   - The relative order of non-zero numbers remains the same\n   - The number of zeros remains the same\n\n3) The rule appears to be:\n   - Take all non-zero numbers in their original order\n   - Place them at the start of the sequence\n   - Fill the remaining positions with zeros\n\nLet's write code to verify this pattern and apply it to the test case:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_str):\n    # Convert input string to list of numbers\n    numbers = [int(x) for x in input_str.split()]\n    \n    # Separate non-zero numbers and count zeros\n    non_zeros = [x for x in numbers if x != 0]\n    zero_count = numbers.count(0)\n    \n    # Create output by combining non-zeros and zeros\n    output = non_zeros + [0] * zero_count\n    \n    # Print result\n    print(' '.join(map(str, output)))\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = \"0 0 0 0 0 1 5 0 0 0\"\ntransform_grid(test_input)\n```\n\nThe code takes the input sequence, separates non-zero numbers while preserving their order, and then appends the required number of zeros at the end.\n\nFor our test input \"0 0 0 0 0 1 5 0 0 0\":\n- Non-zero numbers in order: 1, 5\n- Number of zeros: 8\n- Therefore, the output should be: 1 5 followed by 8 zeros\n\n<<<1 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>",
    "Based on the code execution output, my analysis and answer are correct.\n\nThe rule I identified was:\n1. Preserve all non-zero numbers in their original relative order\n2. Move these non-zero numbers to the leftmost positions\n3. Fill the remaining positions with zeros\n\nFor the test input \"0 0 0 0 0 1 5 0 0 0\":\n- The only non-zero numbers are 1 and 5\n- They appear in that order in the input\n- There are 8 zeros in total\n- Therefore, the output should start with 1 5 and be followed by 8 zeros\n\nThe code execution confirmed this pattern, producing:\n1 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n<<<1 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
