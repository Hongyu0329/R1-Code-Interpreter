    "Let me analyze this pattern step by step.\n\n1) First, let's analyze what's common in all output grids:\n- They seem to be sorted in some way\n- They start with 0s, then 1s, then 2s\n- The numbers appear to be grouped together\n\n2) Looking at the relationship between input and output:\n- The count of each number (0, 1, 2) in input matches the count in output\n- The output is always sorted in ascending order (0s first, then 1s, then 2s)\n\nLet's verify this hypothesis with code:\n\n```python\ndef analyze_pattern(input_grid, output_grid):\n    # Convert string to list of integers\n    input_counts = [input_grid.count(i) for i in range(3)]\n    output_counts = [output_grid.count(i) for i in range(3)]\n    \n    # Print input and output analysis\n    print(\"Input counts (0,1,2):\", input_counts)\n    print(\"Output counts (0,1,2):\", output_counts)\n    print(\"Output is sorted:\", output_grid == sorted(output_grid))\n\n# Test examples\nexample1_in = [1,1,1,1,2,1,0,0,1,2,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0]\nexample1_out = [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2]\n\nexample2_in = [0,0,0,2,2,2,2,1,2,0,1,1,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,2,2,2,1,1,2,2]\nexample2_out = [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]\n\nprint(\"Example 1:\")\nanalyze_pattern(example1_in, example1_out)\nprint(\"\\nExample 2:\")\nanalyze_pattern(example2_in, example2_out)\n\n# Now analyze test input\ntest_input = [0,0,0,2,0,2,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,2,1,0,0,1,1,0,2,0,0,0,0]\ncounts = [test_input.count(i) for i in range(3)]\nprint(\"\\nTest input counts (0,1,2):\", counts)\n\n# Generate output based on counts\noutput = [0] * counts[0] + [1] * counts[1] + [2] * counts[2]\nprint(\"Predicted output:\", output)\n```\n\nBased on the code analysis and pattern observation:\n1) The rule is simple: Count how many 0s, 1s, and 2s are in the input\n2) In the output, place all 0s first, then all 1s, then all 2s\n\nFor our test input:\n- Count of 0s: 14\n- Count of 1s: 7\n- Count of 2s: 5\n\nTherefore, the output should be 14 zeros, followed by 7 ones, followed by 5 twos.\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2>>>",
