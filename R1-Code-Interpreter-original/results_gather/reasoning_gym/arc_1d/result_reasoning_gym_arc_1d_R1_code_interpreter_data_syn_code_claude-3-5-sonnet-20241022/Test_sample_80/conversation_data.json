    "Let me analyze this pattern step by step.\n\n1) First, let's analyze the relationship between input and output numbers:\n- In the output, most numbers are converted to 5 or 0\n- 0s in the input sometimes remain 0 in output\n- Non-zero numbers in input are mostly converted to 5 in output\n\n2) Let's write code to analyze the pattern more systematically:\n\n```python\ndef analyze_patterns(inputs, outputs):\n    # Convert string inputs to lists of numbers\n    input1 = [0,0,0,0,4,0,4,0,6,3,0,0,7,2,4,2,0,0,0,4,9,1,0,7,0,0,7,2]\n    output1 = [0,0,0,0,5,0,5,0,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,5]\n    input2 = [5,3,4,0,2,2,0,0,8,9,0,1,0,0,0,0,7,9,5,0,3,0,0,2,7,0,0,6]\n    output2 = [5,5,5,0,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5]\n    input3 = [3,9,8,9,0,1,0,5,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,3,4,0,9,5,0,3,6,8,5,0]\n    output3 = [5,5,5,5,0,5,0,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,5,5,0,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0]\n    \n    # Analyze patterns\n    rules = []\n    for i in range(28):\n        if input1[i] != 0 and output1[i] == 5:\n            rules.append(\"non-zero to 5\")\n        elif input1[i] == 0 and output1[i] == 0:\n            rules.append(\"zero stays zero\")\n        else:\n            rules.append(\"special case\")\n    \n    # Test input\n    test_input = [0,2,9,6,0,4,7,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,4,2,0,2,0,7,9,0,6,6,4,0,9,0]\n    \n    # Apply the discovered rule\n    result = []\n    for num in test_input:\n        if num == 0:\n            result.append(0)\n        else:\n            result.append(5)\n    \n    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n```\n\nAfter analyzing the patterns, I can see that:\n1) The main rule is: any non-zero number in the input becomes 5 in the output\n2) Zeros in the input remain 0 in the output\n\nThis rule is consistent across all three example pairs. When we apply this rule to the test input:\n0 2 9 6 0 4 7 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 4 2 0 2 0 7 9 0 6 6 4 0 9 0\n\nWe get:\n\n<<<0 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 5 5 0 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 5 0 5 0>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, given the examples below.\n\nExample 1:\nInput:  0 0 0 0 4 0 4 0 6 3 0 0 7 2 4 2 0 0 0 4 9 1 0 7 0 0 7 2\nOutput: 0 0 0 0 5 0 5 0 5 5 0 0 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 5 5\n\nExample 2:\nInput:  5 3 4 0 2 2 0 0 8 9 0 1 0 0 0 0 7 9 5 0 3 0 0 2 7 0 0 6\nOutput: 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 0 5 5 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 5 5 0 0 5\n\nExample 3:\nInput:  3 9 8 9 0 1 0 5 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 3 4 0 9 5 0 3 6 8 5 0\nOutput: 5 5 5 5 0 5 0 5 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 0\n\nBelow is a test input grid.
