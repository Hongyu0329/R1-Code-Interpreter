    "Let me analyze the pattern between input and output grids.\n\n1) First, let's analyze the changes from input to output in each example:\n\nExample 1: \n- Input:  5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5\n- Output: 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5\n- The sequence of three 5's at the start becomes two 5's, and the two 5's at the end becomes three 5's\n\nExample 2:\n- Input:  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n- Output: 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\n- The single 0 moves one position to the left\n\nExample 3:\n- Input:  7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0\n- Output: 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 7\n- The sequence of two 0's moves one position to the left\n\nLet me write code to verify if there's a consistent pattern:\n\n```python\ndef analyze_pattern(input_str, output_str):\n    # Convert strings to lists\n    input_list = [int(x) for x in input_str.split()]\n    output_list = [int(x) for x in output_str.split()]\n    \n    # Find positions of zeros\n    input_zeros = [i for i, x in enumerate(input_list) if x == 0]\n    output_zeros = [i for i, x in enumerate(output_list) if x == 0]\n    \n    print(f\"Input zeros at: {input_zeros}\")\n    print(f\"Output zeros at: {output_zeros}\")\n    \n    # Print the shifts\n    if input_zeros and output_zeros:\n        print(f\"Shift: {[out - inp for inp, out in zip(input_zeros, output_zeros)]}\")\n\n# Test examples\nprint(\"Example 1:\")\nanalyze_pattern(\"5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5\", \"5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5\")\nprint(\"\\nExample 2:\")\nanalyze_pattern(\"1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\", \"1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\")\nprint(\"\\nExample 3:\")\nanalyze_pattern(\"7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0\", \"7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 7\")\n```\n\nAfter analyzing the patterns, I can see that:\n1. The rule appears to be: any consecutive sequence of zeros moves one position to the left\n2. If zeros are at the end of the sequence, they wrap around to the other end\n3. The non-zero numbers fill in the remaining positions while maintaining their relative order\n\nFor the test input:\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n\nSince there are no zeros in the input, the output should be identical to the input.\n\n<<<4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4>>>",
    "The code output confirms my analysis:\n\n1. In Example 1, all zeros shift one position to the left (shift of -1)\n2. In Example 2, the single zero shifts one position to the left\n3. In Example 3, both zeros shift one position to the left\n\nLet me verify if there are any other patterns I might have missed:\n\n```python\ndef analyze_full_pattern(input_str, output_str):\n    input_list = [int(x) for x in input_str.split()]\n    output_list = [int(x) for x in output_str.split()]\n    \n    # Analyze non-zero numbers and their positions\n    input_nonzeros = [(i, x) for i, x in enumerate(input_list) if x != 0]\n    output_nonzeros = [(i, x) for i, x in enumerate(output_list) if x != 0]\n    \n    print(\"Non-zero numbers and their positions:\")\n    print(f\"Input: {input_nonzeros}\")\n    print(f\"Output: {output_nonzeros}\")\n\nprint(\"Example 1:\")\nanalyze_full_pattern(\"5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5\", \"5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5\")\nprint(\"\\nExample 2:\")\nanalyze_full_pattern(\"1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\", \"1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\")\nprint(\"\\nExample 3:\")\nanalyze_full_pattern(\"7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0\", \"7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 7\")\n```\n\nThis additional analysis confirms my previous conclusion. The rule is:\n\n1. Any consecutive sequence of zeros shifts one position to the left\n2. If zeros reach the left end, they wrap around to the right end\n3. Non-zero numbers maintain their relative positions, filling in the spaces not occupied by zeros\n\nFor the test input (4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4), since there are no zeros in the sequence, no shifting occurs and the output will be identical to the input.\n\n<<<4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4>>>",
    "Looking at the new code output, I notice I missed something important in my previous analysis. The pattern is actually different from what I initially thought:\n\n1. In Example 1:\n   - Input has three 5's at start (positions 0,1,2) and two 5's at end (11,12)\n   - Output has two 5's at start (0,1) and three 5's at end (10,11,12)\n   - The middle 5 from the start group moves to join the end group\n\n2. In Example 2:\n   - The sequence of 1's is interrupted by a 0\n   - In the output, the 0 moves one position left, and the 1 that was after it moves to where the 0 was\n\n3. In Example 3:\n   - Input has eleven 7's followed by two 0's\n   - Output has ten 7's, then two 0's, then one 7\n   - The last 7 from the sequence moves to the end, after the 0's\n\nThe actual rule appears to be:\nWhen there's a sequence of identical numbers interrupted by zeros or the end of the array, one number from the longer sequence moves to join or form a sequence on the other side of the zeros.\n\nFor the test input (4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4), since there are no zeros or interruptions in the sequence, and it's all one continuous sequence of 4's, there should be no changes.\n\n<<<4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4>>>"
