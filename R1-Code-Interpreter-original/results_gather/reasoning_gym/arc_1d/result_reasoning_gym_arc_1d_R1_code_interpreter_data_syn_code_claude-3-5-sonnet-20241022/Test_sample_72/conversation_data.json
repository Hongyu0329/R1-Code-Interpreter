    "Let me analyze the pattern and transformation rules from the given examples.\n\n1) First, let's analyze the patterns:\n- Example 1: 12 7's followed by 4 0's → 3 0's, then 12 7's, then 1 0\n- Example 2: 6 3's followed by 10 0's → 3 0's, then 6 3's, then 7 0's\n- Example 3: Single 2 with rest 0's → 2 moved to position 5\n\nLet me write code to help analyze the patterns:\n\n```python\ndef analyze_pattern(input_grid, output_grid):\n    # Find non-zero sequences\n    input_nonzero = [(i, val) for i, val in enumerate(input_grid) if val != 0]\n    output_nonzero = [(i, val) for i, val in enumerate(output_grid) if val != 0]\n    \n    # Print analysis\n    print(f\"Input sequence: {input_nonzero}\")\n    print(f\"Output sequence: {output_nonzero}\")\n    print(f\"Shift: {output_nonzero[0][0] - input_nonzero[0][0] if input_nonzero and output_nonzero else 'N/A'}\")\n    print(\"---\")\n\n# Example cases\nex1_in = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0]\nex1_out = [0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0]\n\nex2_in = [3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nex2_out = [0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nex3_in = [0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nex3_out = [0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\ntest_in = [0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nprint(\"Pattern Analysis:\")\nanalyze_pattern(ex1_in, ex1_out)\nanalyze_pattern(ex2_in, ex2_out)\nanalyze_pattern(ex3_in, ex3_out)\nanalyze_pattern(test_in, [0]*16)  # For visualization\n```\n\nAfter analyzing the patterns, I can see that:\n1. The rule appears to be: add 3 zeros at the start, then shift the non-zero sequence\n2. The length of the non-zero sequence is preserved\n3. Any trailing positions are filled with zeros\n4. The sequence always starts with 3 zeros in the output\n\nFor the test input [0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]:\n- We have 3 consecutive 2's starting at position 1\n- Following the rule:\n  - Start with 3 zeros\n  - Shift the sequence of three 2's to start at position 3\n  - Fill the rest with zeros\n\n<<<0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>",
    "Thank you for the code output. Let me refine my analysis based on the patterns:\n\n1. Looking at the shifts in all examples:\n- Example 1: Non-zero sequence shifts right by 3 positions\n- Example 2: Non-zero sequence shifts right by 3 positions\n- Example 3: Single number shifts right by 3 positions\n\n2. Common rules observed:\n- All sequences are shifted right by 3 positions\n- Output always starts with 3 zeros\n- The original sequence length and values are preserved\n- Remaining positions are filled with zeros\n\nLet me write code to generate the output for the test case:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Initialize output with zeros\n    output = [0] * 16\n    \n    # Find the non-zero sequence\n    non_zero = [(i, val) for i, val in enumerate(input_grid) if val != 0]\n    \n    # Apply the transformation rule:\n    # Shift each non-zero value 3 positions to the right\n    for i, (pos, val) in enumerate(non_zero):\n        new_pos = pos + 3\n        if new_pos < len(output):\n            output[new_pos] = val\n    \n    return output\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nresult = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n```\n\nBased on the code execution and pattern analysis:\n- Input has three 2's starting at position 1\n- Shifting right by 3 positions:\n  - 2 at position 1 moves to position 4\n  - 2 at position 2 moves to position 5\n  - 2 at position 3 moves to position 6\n- First three positions are zeros\n- Rest of the positions are zeros\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>",
    "The code output matches my reasoning, and I'm confident about the answer. Let me verify one final time:\n\n1. Looking at all examples again:\n- Example 1: [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0,0] → [0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0]\n- Example 2: [3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] → [0,0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n- Example 3: [0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] → [0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n2. For our test input [0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]:\n- The sequence of three 2's starting at position 1\n- Each number shifts 3 positions to the right\n- Therefore, the 2's should be at positions 4, 5, and 6\n- The rest are filled with zeros\n\nThe transformation is consistent with all examples, and I confirm my answer:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
