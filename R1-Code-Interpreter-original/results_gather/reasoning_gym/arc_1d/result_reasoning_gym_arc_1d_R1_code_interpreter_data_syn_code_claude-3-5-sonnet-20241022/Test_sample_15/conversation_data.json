    "Let me analyze the patterns in the examples and derive the rule.\n\nLet's first analyze the differences between input and output grids:\n\n1. Example 1:\n   - Input:  0 0 0 0 2 0 7 7 7 7 7 7\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 2 7 7 7 7 7 7 0\n   - Changes: Last 7 became 0, and the 0 before 7s became 7\n\n2. Example 2:\n   - Input:  2 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n   - Output: 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0\n   - Changes: Last 6 became 0, and the 0 before 6s became 6\n\n3. Example 3:\n   - Input:  8 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 8 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - No changes: All zeros remained zeros\n\nLet's write code to analyze these patterns and verify the rule:\n\n```python\ndef analyze_pattern(input_grid, output_grid):\n    print(\"Analyzing patterns...\")\n    \n    # Find sequences of same numbers\n    def find_sequences(grid):\n        sequences = []\n        current_num = grid[0]\n        current_seq = [0]\n        for i in range(1, len(grid)):\n            if grid[i] == current_num:\n                current_seq.append(i)\n            else:\n                if len(current_seq) > 1:\n                    sequences.append((current_num, current_seq[:]))\n                current_num = grid[i]\n                current_seq = [i]\n        if len(current_seq) > 1:\n            sequences.append((current_num, current_seq[:]))\n        return sequences\n    \n    # Test cases\n    test_cases = [\n        ([0,0,0,0,2,0,7,7,7,7,7,7], [0,0,0,0,2,7,7,7,7,7,7,0]),\n        ([2,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6], [2,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,0]),\n        ([8,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], [8,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0])\n    ]\n    \n    # Analyze each test case\n    for input_seq, output_seq in test_cases:\n        print(\"\\nInput:\", input_seq)\n        print(\"Output:\", output_seq)\n        \n        # Find sequences in input\n        input_sequences = find_sequences(input_seq)\n        print(\"Input sequences:\", input_sequences)\n        \n        # Check changes\n        changes = [(i, input_seq[i], output_seq[i]) for i in range(len(input_seq)) if input_seq[i] != output_seq[i]]\n        print(\"Changes:\", changes)\n\n# Test with example cases\nanalyze_pattern(None, None)\n```\n\nAfter analyzing the patterns, I can derive the rule:\n\n1. If there is a sequence of same numbers (except 0) that extends to the end of the grid:\n   - The last number in the sequence becomes 0\n   - If there's a single 0 immediately before this sequence, it becomes the same number as the sequence\n\n2. If there is no such sequence or if the sequence consists of all zeros, no changes are made\n\nApplying this rule to the test input:\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 2\n\nWe have a sequence of 9s followed by zeros and a 2. The sequence of 9s doesn't extend to the end, so according to the rule, no changes should be made to the 9s. The zeros and 2 at the end also don't form a sequence that needs changing.\n\n<<<9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 2>>>",
    "Let me refine my analysis based on the code output.\n\nLooking at the changes more carefully:\n\n1. Example 1:\n   - A sequence of 7s at the end (positions 6-11)\n   - Changes: position 5 (0→7) and position 11 (7→0)\n\n2. Example 2:\n   - A sequence of 6s at the end (positions 2-11)\n   - Changes: position 1 (0→6) and position 11 (6→0)\n\n3. Example 3:\n   - A sequence of 0s at the end (positions 2-11)\n   - No changes\n\nThe refined rule appears to be:\n1. If there is a sequence of the same non-zero number that extends to the end of the grid:\n   - The last number in the sequence becomes 0\n   - If there is a single 0 immediately before this sequence, it becomes the same number as the sequence\n2. If the sequence at the end consists of all zeros, no changes are made\n\nLet's verify this with another code:\n\n```python\ndef apply_rule(input_grid):\n    # Find the last sequence\n    last_num = input_grid[-1]\n    seq_start = len(input_grid) - 1\n    \n    # Find where the last sequence starts\n    while seq_start > 0 and input_grid[seq_start - 1] == last_num:\n        seq_start -= 1\n    \n    # If we have a sequence of non-zero numbers at the end\n    if last_num != 0 and seq_start < len(input_grid):\n        # Check if there's a zero before the sequence\n        if seq_start > 0 and input_grid[seq_start - 1] == 0:\n            result = input_grid.copy()\n            result[seq_start - 1] = last_num  # Change 0 to sequence number\n            result[-1] = 0  # Change last number to 0\n            return result\n    \n    return input_grid.copy()\n\n# Test with the new input\ntest_input = [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 2]\nresult = apply_rule(test_input)\nprint(\"Input:\", test_input)\nprint(\"Output:\", result)\n```\n\nLooking at the test input: 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 2\n\nThe last sequence is a single 2, preceded by zeros. Since the sequence of 2 is only one number long and doesn't extend to the end (it is the end), no changes should be made according to our rule.\n\n<<<9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 2>>>",
    "I apologize for my previous incorrect conclusion. Looking at the code output and re-analyzing the patterns:\n\n1. Example 1:\n   - Input:  0 0 0 0 2 0 7 7 7 7 7 7\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 2 7 7 7 7 7 7 0\n   - Rule: The 0 before sequence of 7s became 7, last 7 became 0\n\n2. Example 2:\n   - Input:  2 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n   - Output: 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0\n   - Rule: The 0 before sequence of 6s became 6, last 6 became 0\n\n3. Example 3:\n   - Input:  8 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 8 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Rule: No changes as sequence of zeros at end\n\nLooking at test input: 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 2\n\nThe code correctly identified that:\n1. There's a 2 at the end\n2. There's a 0 before it\n3. Following the pattern, the 0 before the 2 should become 2, and the last 2 should become 0\n\nTherefore, I need to revise my previous answer. The correct output should be:\n\n<<<9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 2 0>>>"
