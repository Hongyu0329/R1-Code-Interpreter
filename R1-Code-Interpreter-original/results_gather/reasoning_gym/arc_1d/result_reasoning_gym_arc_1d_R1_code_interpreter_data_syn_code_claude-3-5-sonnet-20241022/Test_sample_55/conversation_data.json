    "Let me analyze the patterns in the examples and derive the rule.\n\n1) First, let's analyze what happens in each example:\n\nExample 1:\n- Input has four 6's starting at position 8\n- Output has those four 6's shifted right by 3 positions\n\nExample 2:\n- Input has twelve 6's starting at position 3\n- Output has those twelve 6's shifted, with one 6 moved to front\n\nExample 3:\n- Input has a single 7 at position 8\n- Output has that 7 shifted right by 3 positions\n\nLet me write code to help analyze the patterns:\n\n```python\ndef analyze_pattern(input_str, output_str):\n    input_arr = [int(x) for x in input_str.split()]\n    output_arr = [int(x) for x in output_str.split()]\n    \n    # Find non-zero sequences\n    def find_sequences(arr):\n        sequences = []\n        current_seq = []\n        current_val = None\n        for i, val in enumerate(arr):\n            if val != 0:\n                if current_val is None or val == current_val:\n                    current_seq.append(i)\n                    current_val = val\n                else:\n                    if current_seq:\n                        sequences.append((current_val, current_seq))\n                    current_seq = [i]\n                    current_val = val\n            else:\n                if current_seq:\n                    sequences.append((current_val, current_seq))\n                    current_seq = []\n                    current_val = None\n        if current_seq:\n            sequences.append((current_val, current_seq))\n        return sequences\n\n    input_seqs = find_sequences(input_arr)\n    output_seqs = find_sequences(output_arr)\n    \n    print(f\"Input sequences: {input_seqs}\")\n    print(f\"Output sequences: {output_seqs}\")\n\n# Test with examples\nprint(\"Example 1:\")\nanalyze_pattern(\"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0\", \n                \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 0\")\n\nprint(\"\\nExample 2:\")\nanalyze_pattern(\"0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0\",\n                \"6 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\")\n\nprint(\"\\nExample 3:\")\nanalyze_pattern(\"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\",\n                \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0\")\n\n# Analyze test input\ntest_input = \"9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9\"\nprint(\"\\nTest input:\")\nanalyze_pattern(test_input, \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\")\n```\n\nAfter analyzing the patterns, I can see the rule:\n1. For sequences of non-zero numbers:\n   - If the sequence is at the start or end, it stays in place\n   - If the sequence is in the middle, it shifts 3 positions to the right\n2. If a sequence would be split across the boundary, the first number moves to the start\n\nFor the test input \"9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9\", we have:\n- Two 9's at the start: stays in place\n- One 9 at the end: stays in place\n\nTherefore, the output should be:\n\n<<<9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9>>>",
    "Thank you for the code output. Let me refine my analysis based on the patterns:\n\nLooking at the sequences more carefully:\n\n1. Example 1: A sequence of four 6's moves right by 3 positions (8->11)\n2. Example 2: A long sequence of 6's is split:\n   - Most of it shifts right\n   - One element moves to the front\n3. Example 3: A single 7 moves right by 3 positions (8->11)\n\nLet me write code to implement and test this pattern:\n\n```python\ndef apply_rule(input_str):\n    # Convert input to list\n    grid = [int(x) for x in input_str.split()]\n    output = [0] * 16\n    \n    # Find sequences of non-zero numbers\n    sequences = []\n    current_seq = []\n    current_val = None\n    \n    for i, val in enumerate(grid):\n        if val != 0:\n            if current_val is None or val == current_val:\n                current_seq.append(i)\n                current_val = val\n            else:\n                if current_seq:\n                    sequences.append((current_val, current_seq[:]))\n                current_seq = [i]\n                current_val = val\n        else:\n            if current_seq:\n                sequences.append((current_val, current_seq[:]))\n                current_seq = []\n                current_val = None\n    if current_seq:\n        sequences.append((current_val, current_seq))\n    \n    # Apply transformation rules\n    for val, positions in sequences:\n        # If sequence starts at beginning or end, keep it there\n        if positions[0] == 0 or positions[-1] == 15:\n            for pos in positions:\n                output[pos] = val\n        else:\n            # Move sequence right by 3 positions\n            for pos in positions:\n                new_pos = pos + 3\n                if new_pos < 16:\n                    output[new_pos] = val\n                else:\n                    # If position would go beyond boundary, wrap to front\n                    output[0] = val\n    \n    return ' '.join(str(x) for x in output)\n\n# Test with all examples\nprint(\"Example 1:\")\nprint(apply_rule(\"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0\"))\nprint(\"Example 2:\")\nprint(apply_rule(\"0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0\"))\nprint(\"Example 3:\")\nprint(apply_rule(\"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"))\nprint(\"Test input:\")\nprint(apply_rule(\"9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9\"))\n```\n\nAfter seeing the results and refining my understanding:\n1. For sequences at the start (positions 0,1) - they stay in place\n2. For sequences at the end (position 15) - they stay in place\n3. For sequences in the middle - they shift 3 positions to the right\n\nFor the test input \"9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9\":\n- The sequence of two 9's at the start (positions 0,1) stays in place\n- The single 9 at the end (position 15) stays in place\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9>>>",
    "The code output confirms that my analysis and implementation correctly matches all the example patterns. Let's verify one final time:\n\n1. Example 1: Correctly shifts the sequence of four 6's right by 3 positions\n2. Example 2: Correctly handles the long sequence by moving one 6 to the front and shifting the rest\n3. Example 3: Correctly shifts the single 7 right by 3 positions\n4. Test input: Correctly keeps the 9's at their original positions (start and end)\n\nThe rule is now clear:\n- Sequences at the start (positions 0,1) stay in place\n- Sequences at the end (position 15) stay in place\n- Sequences in the middle shift 3 positions to the right\n- If a sequence would extend beyond the right boundary, one element moves to the front\n\nFor the test input \"9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9\":\n- The two 9's at positions 0 and 1 stay in place because they're at the start\n- The 9 at position 15 stays in place because it's at the end\n\nI am confident in the final answer:\n\n<<<9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9>>>"
