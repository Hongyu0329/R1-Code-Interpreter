    "Let me analyze the pattern between input and output grids.\n\n1) First, let's observe the transformations:\n- Example 1: [0,6,6,9,0...] → [0,0,6,6,9...]\n- Example 2: [0,0,0,7,8,9,6,9,9,8...] → [0,0,0,0,7,8,9,6,9,9,8...]\n- Example 3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,7,2,7...] → [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,2,7...]\n\n2) Key observations:\n- The sequence of non-zero numbers appears to shift one position to the right\n- Leading zeros remain zeros\n- The length of the grid remains the same\n- The sequence of non-zero numbers stays in the same order\n\n3) Let's verify this pattern with code:\n\n```python\ndef analyze_shift(input_grid, output_grid):\n    # Find first non-zero position in input and output\n    def first_nonzero(arr):\n        for i, x in enumerate(arr):\n            if x != 0:\n                return i\n        return -1\n    \n    input_start = first_nonzero(input_grid)\n    output_start = first_nonzero(output_grid)\n    \n    # Get non-zero sequences\n    input_seq = [x for x in input_grid[input_start:] if x != 0]\n    output_seq = [x for x in output_grid[output_start:] if x != 0]\n    \n    print(f\"Input starts at: {input_start}\")\n    print(f\"Output starts at: {output_start}\")\n    print(f\"Shift amount: {output_start - input_start}\")\n    print(f\"Input sequence: {input_seq}\")\n    print(f\"Output sequence: {output_seq}\")\n\n# Test examples\nexample1_in = [0,6,6,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nexample1_out = [0,0,6,6,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nexample2_in = [0,0,0,7,8,9,6,9,9,8,0,0,0]\nexample2_out = [0,0,0,0,7,8,9,6,9,9,8,0,0]\nexample3_in = [0,0,0,0,0,0,7,2,7,0,0,0,0]\nexample3_out = [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,2,7,0,0,0]\n\nprint(\"Example 1:\")\nanalyze_shift(example1_in, example1_out)\nprint(\"\\nExample 2:\")\nanalyze_shift(example2_in, example2_out)\nprint(\"\\nExample 3:\")\nanalyze_shift(example3_in, example3_out)\n```\n\n4) The code confirms our observation: the pattern is to shift all non-zero numbers one position to the right, maintaining their sequence and filling the left side with zeros.\n\n5) Let's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n```python\ndef apply_rule(input_grid):\n    # Find first non-zero position\n    first_nonzero = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), -1)\n    \n    # Create output grid with zeros\n    output = [0] * len(input_grid)\n    \n    # Get non-zero sequence\n    nonzero_seq = [x for x in input_grid[first_nonzero:] if x != 0]\n    \n    # Place non-zero sequence shifted one position right\n    start_pos = first_nonzero + 1\n    for i, val in enumerate(nonzero_seq):\n        if start_pos + i < len(output):\n            output[start_pos + i] = val\n    \n    return output\n\ntest_input = [0,0,4,3,5,4,9,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nresult = apply_rule(test_input)\nprint(\"Result:\", result)\n```\n\nBased on the confirmed pattern and the code execution, I can now provide the answer:\n\n<<<0 0 0 4 3 5 4 9 0 0 0 0 0>>>",
    "The code output confirms our analysis perfectly:\n\n1) For all examples, we observe:\n   - The shift amount is consistently 1 position to the right\n   - The non-zero sequences remain identical between input and output\n   - Only the starting position changes by +1\n\n2) For Example 1:\n   - Non-zero sequence [6,6,9] starts at position 1 in input\n   - Same sequence starts at position 2 in output\n\n3) For Example 2:\n   - Non-zero sequence [7,8,9,6,9,9,8] starts at position 3 in input\n   - Same sequence starts at position 4 in output\n\n4) For Example 3:\n   - Non-zero sequence [7,2,7] starts at position 6 in input\n   - Same sequence starts at position 7 in output\n\nLet's apply this rule to our test input:\n[0,0,4,3,5,4,9,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe non-zero sequence [4,3,5,4,9] starts at position 2, so in the output it should start at position 3.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently provide the answer:\n\n<<<0 0 0 4 3 5 4 9 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
