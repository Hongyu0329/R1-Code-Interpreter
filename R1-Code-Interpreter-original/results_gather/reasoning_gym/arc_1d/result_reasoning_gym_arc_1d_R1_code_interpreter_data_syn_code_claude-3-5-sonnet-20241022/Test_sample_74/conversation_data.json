    "Let me analyze this pattern step by step.\n\n1. First, let's analyze the relationship between input and output grids:\n- Looking at non-zero numbers in the input being mapped to output\n- Looking for patterns in how zeros are handled\n- Looking for any numerical relationships\n\n2. Observations:\n- Zeros in input remain zeros in output\n- Non-zero numbers in input are mostly mapped to 5 in output\n- The pattern seems to preserve zeros and convert non-zeros to 5\n\n3. Let's verify this hypothesis with Python code:\n\n```python\ndef analyze_patterns(inputs, outputs):\n    print(\"Zero preservation analysis:\")\n    for i in range(len(inputs)):\n        input_list = [int(x) for x in inputs[i].split()]\n        output_list = [int(x) for x in outputs[i].split()]\n        \n        print(f\"\\nExample {i+1}:\")\n        print(\"Input:\", input_list)\n        print(\"Output:\", output_list)\n        \n        # Analyze zero preservation\n        for j in range(len(input_list)):\n            if input_list[j] == 0:\n                print(f\"Position {j}: Input 0 -> Output {output_list[j]}\")\n            else:\n                print(f\"Position {j}: Input {input_list[j]} -> Output {output_list[j]}\")\n\n# Example inputs and outputs\ninputs = [\n    \"0 0 5 0 8 8 0 4 0 8\",\n    \"0 6 2 6 0 7 2 0 3 0\",\n    \"9 5 7 3 3 6 0 0 0 3\"\n]\n\noutputs = [\n    \"0 0 5 0 5 5 0 5 0 5\",\n    \"0 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 0\",\n    \"5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 5\"\n]\n\nanalyze_patterns(inputs, outputs)\n```\n\nAfter analyzing the patterns, I can confirm the rule:\n1. If the input number is 0, the output number is 0\n2. If the input number is non-zero, the output number is 5\n\nFor the test input: 0 0 0 0 8 0 7 9 7 0\n\nApplying the rule:\n- 0 → 0\n- 0 → 0\n- 0 → 0\n- 0 → 0\n- 8 → 5\n- 0 → 0\n- 7 → 5\n- 9 → 5\n- 7 → 5\n- 0 → 0\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 5 0 5 5 5 0>>>",
    "The code output confirms my analysis. Let me verify the rule one more time:\n\n1. The pattern is clear and consistent across all examples:\n   - When input is 0, output is always 0\n   - When input is any non-zero number (1-9), output is always 5\n\n2. Let's verify this with another code to be absolutely certain:\n\n```python\ndef verify_rule(input_str, output_str):\n    input_nums = [int(x) for x in input_str.split()]\n    output_nums = [int(x) for x in output_str.split()]\n    \n    print(\"Rule verification:\")\n    all_follow_rule = True\n    for i, (inp, out) in enumerate(zip(input_nums, output_nums)):\n        follows_rule = (inp == 0 and out == 0) or (inp != 0 and out == 5)\n        print(f\"Position {i}: {inp} -> {out} : {'Follows rule' if follows_rule else 'Breaks rule'}\")\n        all_follow_rule = all_follow_rule and follows_rule\n    \n    print(f\"\\nOverall rule compliance: {all_follow_rule}\")\n\n# Test all examples\nexamples = [\n    (\"0 0 5 0 8 8 0 4 0 8\", \"0 0 5 0 5 5 0 5 0 5\"),\n    (\"0 6 2 6 0 7 2 0 3 0\", \"0 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 0\"),\n    (\"9 5 7 3 3 6 0 0 0 3\", \"5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 5\")\n]\n\nfor i, (inp, out) in enumerate(examples):\n    print(f\"\\nExample {i+1}:\")\n    verify_rule(inp, out)\n```\n\nThe rule is confirmed. For the test input \"0 0 0 0 8 0 7 9 7 0\":\n- All zeros (positions 0,1,2,3,5,9) will remain 0\n- All non-zeros (8,7,9,7 at positions 4,6,7,8) will become 5\n\nTherefore, I am confident in my answer:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 5 0 5 5 5 0>>>",
    "The code output further confirms our rule analysis. The verification shows that in all examples:\n1. Every 0 in the input maps to 0 in the output\n2. Every non-zero number in the input maps to 5 in the output\n3. All examples show 100% compliance with this rule\n\nFor the test input \"0 0 0 0 8 0 7 9 7 0\", I remain confident in my previous answer:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 5 0 5 5 5 0>>>"
