The rule involves shifting non-zero sequences to the left\n2. The shift amount depends on the sequence length:\n   - For sequences of 3 or fewer numbers: shift left by 1 position\n   - For sequences of more than 3 numbers: shift left by 2 positions\n\nFor the test input:\n- We have six 9's starting at position 10\n- Since the sequence length is 6 (> 3), we should shift left by 2 positions\n- The sequence should start at position 8 instead of 10\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0>>>",
    "Based on the code execution output and my analysis, I can confirm that this is indeed the correct answer. Let me explain why:\n\n1. The test input has a sequence of six 9's starting at position 10\n2. Following the pattern we discovered:\n   - Sequences of length > 3 get shifted 2 positions to the left\n   - Sequences of length â‰¤ 3 get shifted 1 position to the left\n\n3. In this case:\n   - The sequence length is 6 (> 3)\n   - Therefore, it should shift 2 positions to the left\n   - Original starting position: 10\n   - New starting position: 8\n\n4. The output matches all the pattern rules we discovered from the examples:\n   - The sequence maintains its length (six 9's)\n   - The shift amount (2) is correct for a sequence longer than 3\n   - The rest of the positions are filled with zeros\n\nThe code execution produced the expected result, which follows the same transformation rules as all the example cases.\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0>>>"
