    "Let me analyze the patterns in the examples and derive the rule.\n\n1) First, let's analyze the key characteristics:\n- All grids are 25 elements long\n- They contain numbers (1, 2, 3, or 5) and zeros\n- The non-zero numbers in each grid are the same (e.g., all 3s, all 5s, etc.)\n\n2) Let's analyze the transformation patterns:\n- Example 1: 3s at start and end → 3s moved slightly right at start and kept at end\n- Example 2: 5s at start and end → 5s moved slightly right at start and one 5 at end\n- Example 3: 1s at start and end → 1s moved right and became contiguous, zeros at ends\n\nLet me write code to help analyze the patterns more systematically:\n\n```python\ndef analyze_pattern(input_str, output_str):\n    input_arr = [int(x) for x in input_str.split()]\n    output_arr = [int(x) for x in output_str.split()]\n    \n    # Find non-zero number\n    num = next(x for x in input_arr if x != 0)\n    \n    # Count numbers and positions\n    input_count = sum(1 for x in input_arr if x == num)\n    output_count = sum(1 for x in output_arr if x == num)\n    \n    # Find first and last positions\n    input_first = input_arr.index(num)\n    input_last = len(input_arr) - 1 - input_arr[::-1].index(num)\n    output_first = output_arr.index(num)\n    output_last = len(output_arr) - 1 - output_arr[::-1].index(num)\n    \n    print(f\"Number: {num}\")\n    print(f\"Count: Input={input_count}, Output={output_count}\")\n    print(f\"First position: Input={input_first}, Output={output_first}\")\n    print(f\"Last position: Input={input_last}, Output={output_last}\")\n    print(\"---\")\n\n# Analyze each example\nprint(\"Example 1:\")\nanalyze_pattern(\"3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\", \n                \"3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\")\n\nprint(\"Example 2:\")\nanalyze_pattern(\"5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5\",\n                \"5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5\")\n\nprint(\"Example 3:\")\nanalyze_pattern(\"1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\",\n                \"0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\")\n```\n\nAfter analyzing the patterns, I can see the rule:\n1. The number of non-zero digits remains the same between input and output\n2. The pattern seems to be about consolidating numbers and shifting them:\n   - If numbers are at the start, they get shifted slightly right and become contiguous\n   - If numbers are at the end, they generally stay there or reduce to a single digit\n   - The middle section becomes zeros\n\nFor the test input (2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2), we have:\n- Four 2s at the start\n- Ten 2s at the end\n- Following the pattern, the 2s at the start should shift right and become contiguous\n- The end section should maintain most of its 2s\n\n<<<0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2>>>",
    "Let me refine my analysis based on the code output.\n\nKey observations from the code:\n1. The count of non-zero numbers remains exactly the same in input and output\n2. Example 1: 17 threes, spread across start and end → consolidated into two groups\n3. Example 2: 6 fives, at start and end → consolidated into one group at start, single at end\n4. Example 3: 6 ones, mostly at start → all consolidated into one contiguous group\n\nLet me write another analysis to look at the grouping patterns:\n\n```python\ndef analyze_groups(input_str, output_str):\n    input_arr = [int(x) for x in input_str.split()]\n    output_arr = [int(x) for x in output_str.split()]\n    \n    # Find groups in input\n    input_groups = []\n    current_group = []\n    for i, x in enumerate(input_arr):\n        if x != 0:\n            current_group.append(i)\n        elif current_group:\n            input_groups.append(current_group)\n            current_group = []\n    if current_group:\n        input_groups.append(current_group)\n    \n    # Find groups in output\n    output_groups = []\n    current_group = []\n    for i, x in enumerate(output_arr):\n        if x != 0:\n            current_group.append(i)\n        elif current_group:\n            output_groups.append(current_group)\n            current_group = []\n    if current_group:\n        output_groups.append(current_group)\n    \n    print(\"Input groups:\", [len(g) for g in input_groups])\n    print(\"Input group positions:\", input_groups)\n    print(\"Output groups:\", [len(g) for g in output_groups])\n    print(\"Output group positions:\", output_groups)\n    print(\"---\")\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = \"2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\"\nprint(\"Test case:\")\nanalyze_groups(test_input, \"\")\n```\n\nLooking at the test input:\n1. We have 14 twos in total\n2. They are arranged in two groups:\n   - First group: 4 twos at the start (positions 0-3)\n   - Second group: 10 twos at the end (positions 15-24)\n\nThe rule appears to be:\n1. Take the first group and shift it right by 2 positions\n2. The end group gets consolidated towards the end\n3. The middle remains zeros\n\nLet me revise my answer:\n\n<<<0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2>>>",
    "Let me analyze the patterns more systematically with the new information.\n\nLooking at the original examples again with the group analysis:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: 3 (1) + zeros + 3s (16) → Output: 3s (4) + zeros + 3s (13)\n- First group of 1 expanded to 4\n- Second group of 16 reduced to 13\n\nExample 2:\nInput: 5s (2) + zeros + 5s (4) → Output: 5s (5) + zeros + 5s (1)\n- First group of 2 expanded to 5\n- Second group of 4 reduced to 1\n\nExample 3:\nInput: 1s (5) + zeros + 1s (1) → Output: zeros + 1s (6) + zeros\n- Groups combined into one contiguous group of 6\n\nLet me write code to verify this pattern:\n\n```python\ndef analyze_transformation(input_str, output_str):\n    input_arr = [int(x) for x in input_str.split()]\n    output_arr = [int(x) for x in output_str.split()]\n    \n    # Find groups and their sizes\n    def find_groups(arr):\n        groups = []\n        current_size = 0\n        for x in arr:\n            if x != 0:\n                current_size += 1\n            elif current_size > 0:\n                groups.append(current_size)\n                current_size = 0\n        if current_size > 0:\n            groups.append(current_size)\n        return groups\n    \n    input_groups = find_groups(input_arr)\n    output_groups = find_groups(output_arr)\n    \n    print(f\"Input groups sizes: {input_groups}\")\n    print(f\"Output groups sizes: {output_groups}\")\n    print(f\"Total numbers: {sum(input_groups)} -> {sum(output_groups)}\")\n    print(\"---\")\n\n# Analyze all examples\nprint(\"Example 1:\")\nanalyze_transformation(\"3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\",\n                      \"3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\")\n\nprint(\"Example 2:\")\nanalyze_transformation(\"5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5\",\n                      \"5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5\")\n\nprint(\"Example 3:\")\nanalyze_transformation(\"1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\",\n                      \"0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\")\n\nprint(\"Test case:\")\nanalyze_transformation(\"2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\", \"\")\n```\n\nNow I can see the clear pattern:\n1. When there are two groups, the first group expands by a small amount (2-3 numbers)\n2. The second group compensates by reducing its size\n3. The total count remains the same\n4. The groups maintain some separation\n\nFor our test case with [4, 10] groups (total 14 numbers):\n- First group should expand from 4 to 6\n- Second group should reduce from 10 to 8\n- Maintain spacing between groups\n\n<<<0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0>>>",
    "Now with the exact group size transformations, I can see the precise pattern:\n\nExample 1: [1, 16] → [4, 13]\n- First group expanded by 3\n- Second group reduced by 3\n- Total preserved: 17\n\nExample 2: [2, 4] → [5, 1]\n- First group expanded by 3\n- Second group reduced by 3\n- Total preserved: 6\n\nExample 3: [5, 1] → [6]\n- Groups merged into one\n- Total preserved: 6\n\nThe clear rule is:\n1. When there are two groups:\n   - First group expands by exactly 3 numbers\n   - Second group reduces by exactly 3 numbers\n   - Position of first group starts after 2 zeros\n   - Second group maintains its end position or shifts slightly left\n\nFor our test case [4, 10]:\n- First group should expand from 4 to 7 (add 3)\n- Second group should reduce from 10 to 7 (subtract 3)\n- Total remains 14\n- First group starts after 2 zeros\n- Second group stays near the end\n\n<<<0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0>>>"
