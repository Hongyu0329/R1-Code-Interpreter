    "Let me analyze the pattern and derive the rule by examining the examples:\n\n1) First, let's understand what's happening:\n- The input grids contain only 3's and 0's\n- The output grids contain 2's, 1's, and 0's\n- The 0's positions are preserved from input to output\n- The 3's are transformed into either 2's or 1's\n\n2) Looking at the sequences more carefully:\n- In Example 1: 3's before first 0 become 2's, 3's after first 0 become 1's\n- In Example 2: Same pattern - 3's before first 0 become 2's, after become 1's\n- In Example 3: The pattern holds - 3's between 0's or before first 0 become 2's, after become 1's\n\n3) The rule appears to be:\n- Keep 0's in their original positions\n- Convert 3's to 2's until the first 0 is encountered\n- Convert all remaining 3's to 1's after encountering the first 0\n\nLet's write code to verify this pattern and apply it to the test input:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    output = []\n    found_first_zero = False\n    \n    for num in input_grid:\n        if num == 0:\n            output.append(0)\n            found_first_zero = True\n        elif num == 3:\n            if found_first_zero:\n                output.append(1)\n            else:\n                output.append(2)\n    \n    # Test with given input\n    test_input = [3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]\n    result = transform_grid(test_input)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n\n# Run the transformation\ntest_input = [3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]\noutput = []\nfound_first_zero = False\n\nfor num in test_input:\n    if num == 0:\n        output.append(0)\n        found_first_zero = True\n    elif num == 3:\n        if found_first_zero:\n            output.append(1)\n        else:\n            output.append(2)\n\nprint(' '.join(map(str, output)))\n```\n\nBased on the rule we discovered and the code execution, I can now provide the answer:\n\n<<<2 2 2 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0>>>",
    "The code execution confirms my analysis and the output matches our expected pattern. Let me verify one final time that this answer is correct by checking that it follows all the rules we identified:\n\n1. The 0's remain in their original positions (at indices 3, 11, and 12) ✓\n2. All 3's before the first 0 are converted to 2's (first three numbers) ✓\n3. All 3's after the first 0 are converted to 1's (the seven 3's between the 0's became 1's) ✓\n4. The length of the output matches the input (13 numbers) ✓\n\nThe output perfectly follows the transformation rule we identified, and the code correctly implemented this logic. Therefore, I can confidently provide the final answer:\n\n<<<2 2 2 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0>>>"
