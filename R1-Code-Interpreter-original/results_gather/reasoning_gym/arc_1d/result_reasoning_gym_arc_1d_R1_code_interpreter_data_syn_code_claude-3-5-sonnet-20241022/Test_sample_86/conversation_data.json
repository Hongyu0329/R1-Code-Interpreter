Let me try one more time with a different approach:\n\n```python\ndef apply_rule(input_str):\n    # Convert input to list of integers\n    grid = [int(x) for x in input_str.split()]\n    n = len(grid)\n    result = [0] * n\n    \n    # Find non-zero sequences\n    nonzero_nums = []\n    for x in grid:\n        if x != 0:\n            nonzero_nums.append(x)\n    \n    # Find first non-zero position\n    first_pos = next(i for i, x in enumerate(grid) if x != 0)\n    \n    # Rule: Move all numbers 4 positions to the left\n    new_start = (first_pos - 4) % n\n    \n    # Place numbers\n    for i, num in enumerate(nonzero_nums):\n        result[(new_start + i) % n] = num\n    \n    return ' '.join(map(str, result))\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = \"8 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 7 2 8 4 5 1 8 2\"\nprint(apply_rule(test_input))\n```\n\nLooking at all examples again, I realize the pattern:\n1. Take all non-zero numbers in their original sequence\n2. Move them 4 positions to the LEFT (not right as I previously thought)\n3. If they would go past the left edge, wrap around to the right\n\nThis explains:\n- Example 1: [5,1,5,6] moves 4 left\n- Example 2: 9 moves 4 left from 15, wrapping to 0\n- Example 3: The sequence moves 4 left, with wrapping\n\nBased on this final understanding, here's my answer:\n\n<<<4 8 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 7 2 8 4 5 1 8 2>>>",
