    "Let me analyze the patterns in the examples and derive the rule.\n\n1) First, let's analyze what changes between input and output:\n\nExample 1:\n- Input:  0 0 0 0 1 0 0 7 7 7 0 0 0 0\n- Output: 0 0 0 0 1 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0\nChanges: The 7s are moved to be right after 1\n\nExample 2:\n- Input:  1 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- Output: 1 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nChanges: No changes - sequence already follows pattern\n\nExample 3:\n- Input:  1 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n- Output: 1 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0\nChanges: 7s are moved to be right after 1, 0 moved to end\n\nLet's write code to verify the pattern and apply it to the test case:\n\n```python\ndef find_pattern(input_grid):\n    # Convert to list for manipulation\n    grid = list(map(int, input_grid.split()))\n    \n    # Find position of 1\n    one_pos = grid.index(1)\n    \n    # Count non-zero numbers after 1\n    non_zeros = [x for x in grid[one_pos+1:] if x != 0]\n    \n    # Create output grid\n    output = [0] * len(grid)\n    output[one_pos] = 1  # Keep 1 in same position\n    \n    # Place non-zeros right after 1\n    for i, val in enumerate(non_zeros):\n        if one_pos + 1 + i < len(grid):\n            output[one_pos + 1 + i] = val\n    \n    # Convert back to string\n    return ' '.join(map(str, output))\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = \"1 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"\nprint(find_pattern(test_input))\n```\n\nThe rule appears to be:\n1. The position of 1 remains fixed\n2. All non-zero numbers after 1 are moved to be consecutive positions right after 1\n3. All remaining positions are filled with 0\n\nFor the test input \"1 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\", applying this rule:\n1. Keep 1 in first position\n2. Move 9 to be right after 1\n3. Fill rest with 0s\n\n<<<1 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>",
    "Based on the code execution output and no errors, I can confirm that my analysis and implementation were correct.\n\nLet me verify why this is the right answer:\n\n1. The rule I identified from the examples was:\n   - Position of 1 stays fixed\n   - All non-zero numbers after 1 are moved to be consecutive positions right after 1\n   - All remaining positions are filled with 0\n\n2. In the test input: 1 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - 1 is in the first position\n   - The only other non-zero number is 9\n   - Following the rule, 9 should move to be right after 1\n   - All other positions should be 0\n\n3. The code correctly implemented this transformation and produced:\n   1 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThis matches our expected pattern as seen in the examples:\n- Example 1: moved 7s right after 1\n- Example 2: already in correct pattern\n- Example 3: moved 7s right after 1\n\nTherefore, I can confidently provide the final answer:\n\n<<<1 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
