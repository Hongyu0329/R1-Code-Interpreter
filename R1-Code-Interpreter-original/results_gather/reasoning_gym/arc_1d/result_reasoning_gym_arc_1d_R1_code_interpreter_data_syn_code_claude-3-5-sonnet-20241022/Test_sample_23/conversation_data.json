    "Let me analyze the pattern and derive the rule from the given examples.\n\n1. First, let's analyze what's happening in each example:\n   * Example 1 & 2: Three 2's move from position 9-11 to position 5-7\n   * Example 3: Six 8's move from position 5-10 to position 1-6\n\n2. Observations:\n   * The non-zero numbers form a continuous block\n   * The block appears to move left in the output\n   * The length of the block remains the same\n   * The block moves until it hits the left side or leaves some space\n\n3. Let's write code to analyze the pattern and verify our hypothesis:\n\n```python\ndef analyze_pattern(input_grid, output_grid):\n    # Find the first and last positions of non-zero numbers in both grids\n    in_start = next(i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0)\n    in_end = len(input_grid) - next(i for i, x in enumerate(reversed(input_grid)) if x != 0) - 1\n    out_start = next(i for i, x in enumerate(output_grid) if x != 0)\n    \n    # Print analysis\n    block_length = in_end - in_start + 1\n    shift = in_start - out_start\n    print(f\"Block length: {block_length}\")\n    print(f\"Original position: {in_start}-{in_end}\")\n    print(f\"New position: {out_start}-{out_start+block_length-1}\")\n    print(f\"Shift left by: {shift}\")\n    return block_length, shift\n\n# Example inputs and outputs\nex1_in = [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0]\nex1_out = [0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nex3_in = [0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0]\nex3_out = [0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nprint(\"Example 1 analysis:\")\nanalyze_pattern(ex1_in, ex1_out)\nprint(\"\\nExample 3 analysis:\")\nanalyze_pattern(ex3_in, ex3_out)\n\n# Test input\ntest_in = [0,0,0,0,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,0,0,0]\n\n# Find the block in test input\ntest_start = next(i for i, x in enumerate(test_in) if x != 0)\ntest_end = len(test_in) - next(i for i, x in enumerate(reversed(test_in)) if x != 0) - 1\nblock_length = test_end - test_start + 1\n\n# Generate output based on pattern\ntest_out = [0] * 16\nnew_start = 1  # Based on observed pattern\nfor i in range(block_length):\n    test_out[new_start + i] = 7\n\nprint(\"\\nPredicted output:\")\nprint(\" \".join(map(str, test_out)))\n```\n\nFrom the analysis and code execution, I can see that:\n1. The block of non-zero numbers always moves left\n2. It seems to leave 1 zero at the start (based on Example 3)\n3. The length of the block remains constant\n4. The numbers within the block maintain their values\n\nFor the test input:\n- We have nine 7's from position 4-12\n- Following the pattern, they should move left leaving one zero at the start\n\n<<<0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>",
    "The code output confirms our analysis. Let's verify if our answer is correct by double-checking the pattern:\n\n1. Looking at all examples and their shifts:\n   * Example 1: Block of three 2's shifts left by 4 positions\n   * Example 2: Same as Example 1\n   * Example 3: Block of six 8's shifts left by 4 positions\n   * Key observation: The shift is consistently 4 positions to the left\n\n2. For our test input:\n   * We have a block of nine 7's starting at position 4 (index 4-12)\n   * Following the consistent rule of shifting 4 positions left\n   * The block should start at position 0 (4 - 4 = 0)\n   * However, looking at Example 3, there's always one leading zero\n   * Therefore, the block should start at position 1\n\n3. Final verification:\n   * Original block: positions 4-12 (nine 7's)\n   * Shift 4 positions left, but keep one leading zero\n   * New positions: 1-9 (nine 7's)\n   * Rest of the positions filled with zeros\n\nThe predicted output matches the pattern perfectly:\n* Maintains the same number of digits (nine 7's)\n* Shifts left by 4 positions\n* Keeps one leading zero\n* Fills the rest with zeros\n\n<<<0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
