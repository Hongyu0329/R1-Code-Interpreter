    "Let me analyze the patterns in the examples and derive the rule.\n\n1) First, let's analyze what stays constant and what changes between input and output:\n- Example 1: Input and output are identical\n- Example 2: Input and output are identical\n- Example 3: Shows some movement/rearrangement of numbers\n\n2) Let's look at the patterns more closely:\n- All grids are 28 numbers long\n- Each grid contains mostly 0s and some sequence of repeated numbers\n- There's always a single 2 somewhere in the sequence\n- The position of 2 seems important\n\n3) Looking at Example 3 more carefully:\n- Input has 2 at position 2, followed by 18 8s\n- Output has the 8s rearranged, with some moving before the 2\n- It seems the numbers after 2 get redistributed around it\n\nLet me write code to analyze this pattern more systematically:\n\n```python\ndef analyze_pattern(input_grid, output_grid):\n    # Convert string to list of integers\n    input_nums = [int(x) for x in input_grid.split()]\n    output_nums = [int(x) for x in output_grid.split()]\n    \n    # Find position of 2\n    two_pos_in = input_nums.index(2)\n    two_pos_out = output_nums.index(2)\n    \n    # Find sequence of non-zero numbers after 2\n    sequence = []\n    current_num = None\n    count = 0\n    \n    for num in input_nums[two_pos_in+1:]:\n        if num != 0 and num != 2:\n            if current_num is None or num == current_num:\n                current_num = num\n                count += 1\n            else:\n                if count > 0:\n                    sequence.append((current_num, count))\n                current_num = num\n                count = 1\n    if count > 0:\n        sequence.append((current_num, count))\n    \n    print(f\"Position of 2: {two_pos_in}\")\n    print(f\"Sequence after 2: {sequence}\")\n    print(\"Output arrangement:\", output_nums)\n\n# Test with Example 3\nexample3_in = \"0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\"\nexample3_out = \"0 0 2 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0\"\nprint(\"Example 3 analysis:\")\nanalyze_pattern(example3_in, example3_out)\n\n# Test with our input\ntest_input = \"0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0\"\nprint(\"\\nTest input analysis:\")\nanalyze_pattern(test_input, test_input)\n```\n\nAfter analyzing the patterns, I can see the rule:\n1. If there's a sequence of repeated numbers after the 2, and there's enough space before the 2, some of those numbers move to fill the space before the 2\n2. The movement maintains the total count of numbers\n3. The sequence is centered around the position of 2\n4. Three zeros are preserved at each end of the grid\n\nFor our test input:\n- We have 2 at position 1\n- Followed by thirteen 4s\n- Following the same rule as Example 3, we should center these 4s around the 2\n\n<<<0 2 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0>>>",
    "Let me refine my analysis based on the code output.\n\nLooking at Example 3 more carefully:\n1. Input has 2 at position 2, with 18 8s after some zeros\n2. In the output, the 8s are redistributed to be more centered in the grid, keeping 3 zeros at each end\n\nLet me write a code to find the exact redistribution pattern:\n\n```python\ndef analyze_redistribution(input_str, output_str):\n    input_grid = [int(x) for x in input_str.split()]\n    output_grid = [int(x) for x in output_str.split()]\n    \n    # Find the non-zero sequence\n    non_zero = [(i, x) for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0 and x != 2]\n    sequence_num = non_zero[0][1] if non_zero else 0\n    sequence_count = len(non_zero)\n    \n    # Find position of 2\n    two_pos = input_grid.index(2)\n    \n    # Count leading and trailing zeros in output\n    leading_zeros = 0\n    trailing_zeros = 0\n    for x in output_grid:\n        if x == 0:\n            leading_zeros += 1\n        else:\n            break\n    for x in reversed(output_grid):\n        if x == 0:\n            trailing_zeros += 1\n        else:\n            break\n            \n    print(f\"Number in sequence: {sequence_num}\")\n    print(f\"Count in sequence: {sequence_count}\")\n    print(f\"Position of 2: {two_pos}\")\n    print(f\"Leading zeros in output: {leading_zeros}\")\n    print(f\"Trailing zeros in output: {trailing_zeros}\")\n    print(\"Output pattern:\", output_grid)\n\n# Test with Example 3\nexample3_in = \"0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\"\nexample3_out = \"0 0 2 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0\"\nprint(\"Example 3 analysis:\")\nanalyze_redistribution(example3_in, example3_out)\n\n# Test with our test input\ntest_input = \"0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0\"\nprint(\"\\nTest input analysis:\")\nanalyze_redistribution(test_input, test_input)\n```\n\nNow I can see the exact pattern:\n1. The sequence of repeated numbers (4s in our test case) gets redistributed to be centered in the grid\n2. The position of 2 remains fixed\n3. Exactly 3 zeros are preserved at each end\n4. The sequence is spread evenly around the middle of the grid\n\nFor our test input:\n- We have 2 at position 1\n- We have thirteen 4s\n- Following the pattern from Example 3, we should keep 3 zeros at each end and center the 4s in the remaining space\n\n<<<0 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0>>>",
    "Let me analyze the pattern more precisely based on the code output.\n\nKey observations:\n1. Looking at Example 3:\n   - Input has 18 8s\n   - Output keeps 2 in same position (pos 2)\n   - Output has 2 leading zeros and 3 trailing zeros\n   - The 8s are distributed in the middle\n\n2. Looking at Example 1 and 2:\n   - When the sequence is already balanced around 2, no change occurs\n   - Both have 3 trailing zeros\n\n3. The rule appears to be:\n   - Keep 2 in its original position\n   - Keep exactly 3 trailing zeros\n   - Distribute the sequence numbers (4s in test case) starting right after the 2\n   - If the sequence is already balanced around 2, no change needed\n\nLet me write code to generate the output following this rule:\n\n```python\ndef generate_output(input_str):\n    # Convert input to list\n    grid = [int(x) for x in input_str.split()]\n    \n    # Find position of 2 and sequence details\n    two_pos = grid.index(2)\n    sequence = [(i, x) for i, x in enumerate(grid) if x != 0 and x != 2]\n    if not sequence:\n        return grid\n    \n    sequence_num = sequence[0][1]\n    sequence_count = len(sequence)\n    \n    # Create output grid\n    output = [0] * 28\n    \n    # Place 2\n    output[two_pos] = 2\n    \n    # Place sequence numbers right after 2\n    for i in range(sequence_count):\n        output[two_pos + 1 + i] = sequence_num\n    \n    # Ensure 3 trailing zeros\n    output[-3:] = [0, 0, 0]\n    \n    return output\n\n# Test with our input\ntest_input = \"0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0\"\nresult = generate_output(test_input)\nprint(\" \".join(str(x) for x in result))\n```\n\nBased on this analysis and the consistent pattern across examples:\n\n<<<0 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0>>>",
    "I notice my output grid was not maintaining the correct length of 28 numbers. Let me make one final analysis:\n\n1. Looking at all examples again:\n- Example 1 and 2 remain unchanged because their sequences are already properly distributed\n- Example 3 shows redistribution where the sequence (8s) is centered in the available space\n- All examples maintain exactly 28 numbers\n\n2. The key rule I now see:\n- Keep 2 in its original position\n- Keep exactly 3 zeros at the end\n- The sequence numbers should be distributed evenly in the middle, maintaining the total grid length of 28\n- Any remaining positions should be filled with zeros\n\nLet me write the final code to generate the correct output:\n\n```python\ndef generate_final_output(input_str):\n    # Convert input to list\n    grid = [int(x) for x in input_str.split()]\n    output = [0] * 28  # Initialize with 28 zeros\n    \n    # Find position of 2 and sequence details\n    two_pos = grid.index(2)\n    sequence = [(i, x) for i, x in enumerate(grid) if x != 0 and x != 2]\n    if not sequence:\n        return grid\n    \n    sequence_num = sequence[0][1]\n    sequence_count = len(sequence)\n    \n    # Place 2\n    output[two_pos] = 2\n    \n    # Calculate start position for sequence to center it\n    available_space = 28 - 3 - (two_pos + 1)  # Total - trailing zeros - (2's position + 1)\n    sequence_start = two_pos + 1\n    \n    # Place sequence numbers\n    for i in range(sequence_count):\n        output[sequence_start + i] = sequence_num\n    \n    # Ensure last 3 positions are zeros\n    output[-3:] = [0, 0, 0]\n    \n    return output\n\n# Test with our input\ntest_input = \"0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0\"\nresult = generate_final_output(test_input)\nprint(\" \".join(str(x) for x in result))\n```\n\nBased on this final analysis and maintaining the 28-number grid:\n\n<<<0 2 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>",
    "Let me make one final observation looking at all examples again:\n\n1. Example 1 and 2 show that when numbers are already in a balanced arrangement, they stay unchanged.\n\n2.
