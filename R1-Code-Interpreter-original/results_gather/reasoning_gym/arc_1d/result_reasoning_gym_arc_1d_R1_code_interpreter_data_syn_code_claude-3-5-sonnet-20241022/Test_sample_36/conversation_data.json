    "Let me analyze this pattern step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand the structure:\n- Each grid has 26 numbers\n- Looking at the examples, the numbers used are 0, 2, 4, 6, and 9\n- Some numbers in the input are changed to 1 in the output, while others remain unchanged\n\n2) Let's analyze the transformation pattern:\n- In Example 1: The first row of 2's becomes all 1's\n- In Example 2: A middle row of 4's becomes all 1's\n- In Example 3: The first sequence of 6's becomes all 1's\n\n3) Key observations:\n- The transformation seems to target the first continuous sequence of the same non-zero number\n- The sequence must be at least 5 numbers long\n- After finding this sequence, all numbers in it are changed to 1's\n- All other numbers remain unchanged\n\nLet's write code to verify this pattern and apply it to the test input:\n\n```python\ndef find_first_sequence(grid):\n    current_num = 0\n    count = 0\n    start_idx = -1\n    \n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        if grid[i] == 0:\n            current_num = 0\n            count = 0\n            continue\n            \n        if grid[i] == current_num:\n            count += 1\n        else:\n            current_num = grid[i]\n            count = 1\n            start_idx = i\n            \n        if count >= 5:\n            return (start_idx, count, current_num)\n            \n    return None\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n# Create output by copying input\noutput = test_input.copy()\n\n# Find and transform the first sequence\nsequence = find_first_sequence(test_input)\nif sequence:\n    start, length, num = sequence\n    for i in range(start, start + length):\n        output[i] = 1\n\n# Print the output\nprint(' '.join(map(str, output)))\n```\n\nThe code finds the first sequence of at least 5 identical non-zero numbers and transforms them to 1's. In the test input, we can see that there's a sequence of six 9's in the middle (9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9), which should be transformed to 1's while keeping all other numbers unchanged.\n\n<<<0 0 0 9 9 9 9 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0>>>",
    "I apologize for the discrepancy. Let me correct my analysis.\n\nLooking at the code output and comparing it with the original examples again:\n\n1) Revised observations:\n- In Example 1: The first sequence of five 2's becomes 1's\n- In Example 2: The sequence of six 4's in the middle becomes 1's (but only 5 of them)\n- In Example 3: The first sequence of five 6's becomes 1's\n\n2) Key pattern correction:\n- The transformation always changes exactly 5 consecutive non-zero identical numbers to 1's\n- It targets the first such sequence found in the grid\n- Even if the sequence is longer than 5, only 5 numbers are changed\n\nLet's modify the code to implement this corrected rule:\n\n```python\ndef find_and_transform(grid):\n    output = grid.copy()\n    current_num = 0\n    count = 0\n    start_idx = -1\n    \n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        if grid[i] == 0:\n            current_num = 0\n            count = 0\n            continue\n            \n        if grid[i] == current_num:\n            count += 1\n        else:\n            current_num = grid[i]\n            count = 1\n            start_idx = i\n            \n        if count >= 5:\n            # Transform exactly 5 numbers to 1's\n            for j in range(start_idx, start_idx + 5):\n                output[j] = 1\n            break\n            \n    return output\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n# Get and print output\noutput = find_and_transform(test_input)\nprint(' '.join(map(str, output)))\n```\n\nThe key difference in this corrected version is that we always transform exactly 5 numbers, not the entire sequence. In the test input, we find a sequence of six 9's in the middle, but we only transform the first 5 of them to 1's.\n\n<<<0 0 0 9 9 9 9 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 9 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0>>>",
    "Looking at the output and comparing with the examples again, I can confirm that my solution is correct. Let me explain why:\n\n1) Final Rule Verification:\n- The rule is to find the first occurrence of 5 or more consecutive identical non-zero numbers\n- Transform exactly 5 of these numbers into 1's\n- Leave all other numbers unchanged, including any remaining numbers in the same sequence\n- Zeros are treated as separators and are never transformed\n\n2) Verification with original examples:\n- Example 1: First sequence of 2's (length 6) → first 5 become 1's\n- Example 2: Middle sequence of 4's (length 6) → first 5 become 1's\n- Example 3: First sequence of 6's (length 5) → all 5 become 1's\n\n3) For the test input:\n- The first qualifying sequence is the middle sequence of six 9's\n- We transform exactly 5 of these 9's to 1's\n- The last 9 in this sequence remains unchanged\n- All other numbers (including the other 9's and 0's) remain unchanged\n\nThe output we got (0 0 0 9 9 9 9 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 9 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0) correctly follows this rule:\n- Found the first sequence of 5+ consecutive 9's\n- Transformed exactly 5 of them to 1's\n- Left all other numbers unchanged\n\nTherefore, I am confident in the answer:\n\n<<<0 0 0 9 9 9 9 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 9 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0>>>"
