    "Let me analyze the pattern and derive the rule by examining the examples.\n\n1. First, let's analyze the key characteristics:\n- All examples have sequences of 0's and another number (3)\n- The length of each sequence remains 16\n- The non-zero numbers seem to shift positions\n- The count of non-zero numbers remains the same between input and output\n\n2. Let's write code to help analyze the patterns:\n\n```python\ndef analyze_pattern(input_str, output_str):\n    input_list = [int(x) for x in input_str.split()]\n    output_list = [int(x) for x in output_str.split()]\n    \n    # Count non-zeros\n    input_nonzeros = sum(1 for x in input_list if x != 0)\n    output_nonzeros = sum(1 for x in output_list if x != 0)\n    \n    # Find start and end positions of non-zeros\n    input_start = next(i for i, x in enumerate(input_list) if x != 0)\n    input_end = len(input_list) - next(i for i, x in enumerate(reversed(input_list)) if x != 0) - 1\n    output_start = next(i for i, x in enumerate(output_list) if x != 0)\n    output_end = len(output_list) - next(i for i, x in enumerate(reversed(output_list)) if x != 0) - 1\n    \n    print(f\"Non-zeros count: Input={input_nonzeros}, Output={output_nonzeros}\")\n    print(f\"Non-zero span: Input={input_start}-{input_end}, Output={output_start}-{output_end}\")\n\n# Analyze examples\nprint(\"Example 1:\")\nanalyze_pattern(\"0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0\", \"0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0\")\nprint(\"\\nExample 2:\")\nanalyze_pattern(\"0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0\", \"3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\")\nprint(\"\\nExample 3:\")\nanalyze_pattern(\"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0\", \"0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\")\n```\n\nAfter analyzing the patterns, I can see that:\n1. The number of non-zero digits remains constant between input and output\n2. The sequence of non-zero numbers shifts to the left\n3. The span of non-zero numbers becomes more compact\n4. The non-zero sequence always ends earlier in the output than in the input\n\nThe rule appears to be:\n- Take all non-zero numbers\n- Shift them left while keeping them together as a continuous sequence\n- Fill the remaining positions with zeros\n- The non-zero sequence starts as early as possible while keeping the same count\n\nFor the test input \"0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\", applying this rule:\n- There are 11 ones in the input\n- They should be shifted left while staying together\n- They should start at the beginning or near the beginning\n\n<<<1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0>>>",
    "Thank you for the code output. This helps confirm my analysis and reveals more precise patterns:\n\n1. Key observations from the code output:\n- In Example 1: 10 non-zeros shift from span 5-14 to 1-10\n- In Example 2: 10 non-zeros shift from span 4-13 to 0-9\n- In Example 3: 6 non-zeros shift from span 8-13 to 4-9\n\n2. More specific pattern found:\n- The output sequence always ends 4-5 positions earlier than the input sequence\n- The output sequence maintains the same length as the input sequence\n- The starting position in the output is determined by the length of the non-zero sequence\n\nLet's verify this with another code analysis:\n\n```python\ndef find_rule(input_str):\n    input_list = [int(x) for x in input_str.split()]\n    \n    # Find non-zero sequence properties\n    nonzero_count = sum(1 for x in input_list if x != 0)\n    first_nonzero = next(i for i, x in enumerate(input_list) if x != 0)\n    last_nonzero = len(input_list) - next(i for i, x in enumerate(reversed(input_list)) if x != 0) - 1\n    \n    # Calculate output positions\n    output_start = max(0, 16 - (last_nonzero - first_nonzero + 1) - 5)\n    output_end = output_start + nonzero_count - 1\n    \n    # Generate output\n    output = ['0'] * 16\n    non_zero_value = input_list[first_nonzero]\n    for i in range(output_start, output_start + nonzero_count):\n        output[i] = str(non_zero_value)\n    \n    print(\"Input analysis:\")\n    print(f\"Non-zero count: {nonzero_count}\")\n    print(f\"Input span: {first_nonzero}-{last_nonzero}\")\n    print(f\"Output span: {output_start}-{output_end}\")\n    print(\"Generated output:\", ' '.join(output))\n\n# Test with the given input\ntest_input = \"0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\"\nfind_rule(test_input)\n```\n\nThe refined rule is:\n1. Count the number of non-zero digits (n)\n2. Create a continuous sequence of these n digits\n3. Place this sequence so that it ends 5 positions from the end\n4. Fill the remaining positions with zeros\n\nBased on this analysis and the test input \"0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\" which has 11 ones:\n\n<<<1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0>>>",
    "The code output confirms my analysis and the predicted answer. Let me summarize why this is correct:\n\n1. From the test input \"0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\":\n- There are 11 ones (non-zero count = 11)\n- They span from position 4 to 14 in the input\n- The output should maintain these 11 ones as a continuous sequence\n\n2. The code analysis shows:\n- Output span should be 0-10\n- This means the sequence of ones starts at the leftmost position\n- The remaining positions (11-15) should be filled with zeros\n\n3. This follows the pattern seen in the examples:\n- The non-zero sequence is shifted left\n- The sequence remains continuous\n- The sequence ends 5 positions from the end\n- The same number of non-zero digits is maintained\n\n4. The generated output matches our reasoning and follows the same rules as the example transformations.\n\nTherefore, I maintain my answer:\n\n<<<1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
