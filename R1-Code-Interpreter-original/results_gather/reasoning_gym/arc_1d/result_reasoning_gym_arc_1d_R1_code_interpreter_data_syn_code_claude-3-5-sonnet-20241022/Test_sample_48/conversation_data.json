    "Let me analyze this pattern step by step.\n\n1) First, let's analyze the output patterns:\n   - All outputs seem to be sorted into sections of 2s, 0s, and 1s in that order\n   - The numbers appear to be grouped together\n   - We need to determine how the input determines the count of each number in output\n\n2) Let's count the occurrences of each number in inputs and outputs:\n\nLet me write code to help analyze this:\n\n```python\ndef analyze_patterns(examples):\n    for i, (inp, out) in enumerate(examples, 1):\n        print(f\"\\nExample {i}:\")\n        print(f\"Input counts:  0s={inp.count('0')}, 1s={inp.count('1')}, 2s={inp.count('2')}\")\n        print(f\"Output counts: 0s={out.count('0')}, 1s={out.count('1')}, 2s={out.count('2')}\")\n        \nexample1_in = \"0 0 0 2 2 0 0 1 1 1 0 2 0 0 0 1 1 0 2 2 0 2\"\nexample1_out = \"2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1\"\nexample2_in = \"0 2 0 0 1 2 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 2 0 0 0 0 1 2\"\nexample2_out = \"2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\"\nexample3_in = \"0 0 0 1 0 0 0 2 1 0 0 0 2 1 2 1 0 0 1 0 2 0\"\nexample3_out = \"2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1\"\ntest_in = \"0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 2 1 2 2 0 0\"\n\nexamples = [\n    (example1_in.split(), example1_out.split()),\n    (example2_in.split(), example2_out.split()),\n    (example3_in.split(), example3_out.split())\n]\n\nanalyze_patterns(examples)\nprint(\"\\nTest input counts:\")\ntest_input = test_in.split()\nprint(f\"0s={test_input.count('0')}, 1s={test_input.count('1')}, 2s={test_input.count('2')}\")\n```\n\nAfter analyzing the patterns, I've discovered the rule:\n1) The output is always arranged in order: 2s first, then 0s, then 1s\n2) The number of 2s in the output equals the number of 2s in the input\n3) The number of 1s in the output equals the number of 1s in the input\n4) The number of 0s in the output equals the number of 0s in the input\n\nLet me verify this with the test input and generate the output:\n\n```python\ntest_input = \"0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 2 1 2 2 0 0\"\nnums = test_input.split()\ntwos = nums.count('2')\nones = nums.count('1')\nzeros = nums.count('0')\n\noutput = ['2'] * twos + ['0'] * zeros + ['1'] * ones\nprint(' '.join(output))\n```\n\nBased on the rule and the test input counts:\n- There are 3 twos (2s)\n- There are 6 ones (1s)\n- There are 13 zeros (0s)\n\nTherefore, the output should be:\n- First 3 positions are 2s\n- Next 13 positions are 0s\n- Last 6 positions are 1s\n\n<<<2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1>>>",
    "The code output confirms my analysis. Let me summarize the key findings:\n\n1) The rule preserves the count of each number (0s, 1s, and 2s) from input to output\n2) The output always arranges the numbers in a specific order:\n   - All 2s come first\n   - Then all 0s\n   - Finally all 1s\n\nFor the test input:\n- There are 3 twos (2s)\n- There are 13 zeros (0s)\n- There are 6 ones (1s)\n\nTherefore, the output will be:\n- First 3 positions filled with 2s\n- Next 13 positions filled with 0s\n- Last 6 positions filled with 1s\n\n<<<2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1>>>"
