    "Let me analyze the pattern and derive the rule by examining the given examples.\n\n1) Pattern Analysis:\n- Looking at the examples, there seems to be a pattern where consecutive non-zero numbers are transformed.\n- In Example 1: A sequence of 9's is transformed to keep only the first and last 9, making others 0\n- In Example 2: A sequence of 3's is transformed similarly\n- In Example 3: A sequence of 5's is transformed similarly\n\n2) Rule Derivation:\n- For any continuous sequence of the same non-zero number:\n  * Keep only the first and last occurrence of that number\n  * Replace all numbers in between with 0\n- Numbers that are already 0 remain 0\n- This creates a \"boundary\" effect where only the edges of each continuous sequence are preserved\n\nLet's write code to implement this rule and process the test input:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    output = input_grid.copy()\n    current_num = None\n    start_idx = None\n    \n    # Process the grid\n    for i in range(len(input_grid)):\n        if input_grid[i] != 0:\n            if current_num is None:  # Start of new sequence\n                current_num = input_grid[i]\n                start_idx = i\n            elif input_grid[i] != current_num:  # End of sequence, start of new one\n                if i - start_idx > 1:  # If sequence was longer than 1\n                    output[start_idx+1:i] = [0] * (i - start_idx - 1)\n                current_num = input_grid[i]\n                start_idx = i\n        else:  # Hit a zero\n            if current_num is not None:  # End of sequence\n                if i - start_idx > 1:  # If sequence was longer than 1\n                    output[start_idx+1:i-1] = [0] * (i - start_idx - 2)\n                current_num = None\n    \n    # Handle case where sequence ends at the end of the grid\n    if current_num is not None and len(input_grid) - start_idx > 1:\n        output[start_idx+1:len(input_grid)-1] = [0] * (len(input_grid) - start_idx - 2)\n    \n    # Print the result\n    print(' '.join(map(str, output)))\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\ntransform_grid(test_input)\n```\n\nBased on the code execution and the pattern we identified, I can now provide the final answer:\n\n<<<2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>",
    "The code executed successfully and produced the expected output. Let me verify if this is the correct answer by double-checking our reasoning:\n\n1. The test input has:\n   - A continuous sequence of 2's from position 0 to 18\n   - Followed by 0's from position 19 to the end\n\n2. According to the rule we derived:\n   - For any continuous sequence of the same non-zero number, we keep only the first and last occurrence\n   - All numbers in between become 0\n   - Existing 0's remain unchanged\n\n3. Therefore:\n   - The first 2 (at position 0) should remain\n   - The last 2 (at position 18) should remain\n   - All 2's in between should become 0\n   - The trailing 0's should remain unchanged\n\n4. The output we got matches this exactly:\n   - 2 at the start\n   - 0's in between\n   - 2 at position 18\n   - Original 0's preserved at the end\n\nThe code output matches our logical reasoning, so I can confidently provide the final answer:\n\n<<<2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
