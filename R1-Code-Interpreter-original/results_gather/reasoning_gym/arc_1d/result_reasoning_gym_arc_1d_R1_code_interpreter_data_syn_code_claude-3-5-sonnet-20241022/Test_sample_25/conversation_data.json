    "Let me analyze the pattern between input and output grids.\n\n1) First, let's understand what's happening in the examples:\n   * Example 1: Single 9 moves right by 2 positions\n   * Example 2: The sequence \"5 7 7 1 3 9 6 7 7 2 8\" moves right by 2 positions\n   * Example 3: The sequence \"3 3 3 7 9 3 7 9 3 7 6 9 9 4 4 5 7 4\" moves left by 3 positions\n\n2) Key observations:\n   * The grid always has 21 positions\n   * The transformation involves shifting a sequence of non-zero numbers\n   * The rest of the positions are filled with zeros\n   * The direction and amount of shift seems to maintain the sequence integrity\n\n3) Let's write code to analyze the pattern more systematically:\n\n```python\ndef analyze_shift(input_str, output_str):\n    input_list = [int(x) for x in input_str.split()]\n    output_list = [int(x) for x in output_str.split()]\n    \n    # Find non-zero sequences\n    def get_nonzero_seq(lst):\n        start = next((i for i, x in enumerate(lst) if x != 0), None)\n        if start is None: return None, None, []\n        end = len(lst) - next((i for i, x in enumerate(reversed(lst)) if x != 0), 0)\n        return start, end, lst[start:end]\n    \n    in_start, in_end, in_seq = get_nonzero_seq(input_list)\n    out_start, out_end, out_seq = get_nonzero_seq(output_list)\n    \n    # Compare sequences and determine shift\n    if in_seq == out_seq:\n        shift = out_start - in_start\n        print(f\"Sequence: {in_seq}\")\n        print(f\"Input position: {in_start}\")\n        print(f\"Output position: {out_start}\")\n        print(f\"Shift: {shift}\")\n\n# Analyze examples\nprint(\"Example 1:\")\nanalyze_shift(\"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\",\n             \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\")\nprint(\"\\nExample 2:\")\nanalyze_shift(\"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 7 7 1 3 9 6 7 7 2 8 0 0 0\",\n             \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 7 7 1 3 9 6 7 7 2 8 0\")\nprint(\"\\nExample 3:\")\nanalyze_shift(\"0 3 3 3 7 9 3 7 9 3 7 6 9 9 4 4 5 7 4 0 0\",\n             \"0 0 0 3 3 3 7 9 3 7 9 3 7 6 9 9 4 4 5 7 4\")\n```\n\nFrom the analysis, I can see that:\n1) The rule is to shift the non-zero sequence by 2 positions to the right\n2) The sequence maintains its order and integrity\n3) All other positions are filled with zeros\n\nFor the test input \"0 0 0 1 8 8 1 7 1 6 8 9 1 8 9 1 5 0 0 0 0\":\n- The non-zero sequence is \"1 8 8 1 7 1 6 8 9 1 8 9 1 5\"\n- It starts at position 3\n- Applying the 2-position right shift rule\n- The sequence should start at position 5\n- Fill the rest with zeros\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 1 8 8 1 7 1 6 8 9 1 8 9 1 5 0 0>>>",
    "The code output confirms my analysis:\n\n1) In all three examples, there is a consistent shift of +2 positions:\n   * Example 1: Single number 9 shifts from position 7 to 9 (shift +2)\n   * Example 2: Sequence starts at position 7, moves to position 9 (shift +2)\n   * Example 3: Sequence starts at position 1, moves to position 3 (shift +2)\n\n2) The rule is now clear:\n   * Take any continuous sequence of non-zero numbers in the input\n   * Shift that entire sequence 2 positions to the right\n   * Fill all other positions with zeros\n   * The sequence maintains its order and integrity\n\n3) For the test input \"0 0 0 1 8 8 1 7 1 6 8 9 1 8 9 1 5 0 0 0 0\":\n   * The non-zero sequence starts at position 3\n   * After shifting 2 positions right, it should start at position 5\n   * Therefore, we need:\n     - 5 zeros at the start (positions 0-4)\n     - The sequence \"1 8 8 1 7 1 6 8 9 1 8 9 1 5\"\n     - 2 zeros at the end\n\nI am confident in my answer:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 1 8 8 1 7 1 6 8 9 1 8 9 1 5 0 0>>>"
