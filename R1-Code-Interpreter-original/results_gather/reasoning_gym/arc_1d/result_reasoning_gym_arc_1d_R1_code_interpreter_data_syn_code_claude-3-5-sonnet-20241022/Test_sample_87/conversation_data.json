    "Let me analyze this pattern step by step.\n\n1) First, let's look at the patterns in the output:\n- All outputs seem to be sorted in descending order (2's, then 1's, then 0's)\n- The number of each digit (0,1,2) in output matches the input\n- It appears to be a sorting problem with specific rules\n\n2) Let's verify this by counting digits in each example:\n\nLet me write code to analyze the examples:\n\n```python\ndef analyze_grids():\n    examples = [\n        (\"0 0 0 0 0 2 0 1 2 1 2 0 0 2 2\", \"2 2 2 2 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"),\n        (\"2 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 2 1 0\", \"2 2 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"),\n        (\"0 1 1 2 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 1\", \"2 2 2 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\")\n    ]\n    \n    for i, (inp, out) in enumerate(examples):\n        inp_list = [int(x) for x in inp.split()]\n        out_list = [int(x) for x in out.split()]\n        \n        print(f\"\\nExample {i+1}:\")\n        print(f\"Input counts:  0s={inp_list.count(0)}, 1s={inp_list.count(1)}, 2s={inp_list.count(2)}\")\n        print(f\"Output counts: 0s={out_list.count(0)}, 1s={out_list.count(1)}, 2s={out_list.count(2)}\")\n\n    # Analyze test input\n    test = \"0 1 0 0 2 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 2 0\"\n    test_list = [int(x) for x in test.split()]\n    print(f\"\\nTest input counts: 0s={test_list.count(0)}, 1s={test_list.count(1)}, 2s={test_list.count(2)}\")\n\nanalyze_grids()\n```\n\nAfter analyzing the patterns, I can confirm:\n1. The rule is to sort the digits in descending order (2's, then 1's, then 0's)\n2. The count of each digit in the output matches the input\n3. This is consistent across all examples\n\nFor the test input \"0 1 0 0 2 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 2 0\":\n- Count of 2's: 2\n- Count of 1's: 4\n- Count of 0's: 9\n\nTherefore, the output should be:\n- First 2 positions: 2's\n- Next 4 positions: 1's\n- Last 9 positions: 0's\n\n<<<2 2 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>",
    "I apologize for my previous analysis. Let me correct the counts for the test input:\n- Count of 2's: 2\n- Count of 1's: 5 (not 4 as I previously stated)\n- Count of 0's: 8\n\nLet me verify if my previous understanding of the rule is still correct by writing code to analyze the pattern more deeply:\n\n```python\ndef analyze_pattern():\n    examples = [\n        (\"0 0 0 0 0 2 0 1 2 1 2 0 0 2 2\", \"2 2 2 2 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"),\n        (\"2 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 2 1 0\", \"2 2 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"),\n        (\"0 1 1 2 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 1\", \"2 2 2 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\")\n    ]\n    \n    for i, (inp, out) in enumerate(examples):\n        inp_list = [int(x) for x in inp.split()]\n        out_list = [int(x) for x in out.split()]\n        \n        print(f\"\\nExample {i+1}:\")\n        print(f\"Input:  {inp}\")\n        print(f\"Output: {out}\")\n        print(f\"Pattern: {out_list[:out_list.count(2)]} | {out_list[out_list.count(2):out_list.count(2)+out_list.count(1)]} | {out_list[-out_list.count(0):]}\")\n\nanalyze_pattern()\n```\n\nThe pattern is confirmed:\n1. The numbers are indeed sorted in descending order (2's, then 1's, then 0's)\n2. The count of each digit in the output exactly matches the input\n3. This creates a consistent pattern where:\n   - All 2's appear first\n   - Then all 1's\n   - Then all 0's\n\nFor the test input \"0 1 0 0 2 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 2 0\":\n- First 2 positions: 2's (2 count)\n- Next 5 positions: 1's (5 count)\n- Last 8 positions: 0's (8 count)\n\n<<<2 2 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>",
    "Your answer is correct, but let me double-check one more aspect. I notice that while we've confirmed the counting and sorting pattern, we should verify if there might be any additional patterns in how the numbers are arranged within their sections.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_sequences():\n    examples = [\n        (\"0 0 0 0 0 2 0 1 2 1 2 0 0 2 2\", \"2 2 2 2 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"),\n        (\"2 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 2 1 0\", \"2 2 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"),\n        (\"0 1 1 2 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 1\", \"2 2 2 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\")\n    ]\n    \n    test = \"0 1 0 0 2 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 2 0\"\n    test_list = [int(x) for x in test.split()]\n    \n    print(\"Test input analysis:\")\n    print(f\"2's count: {test_list.count(2)} (positions in input: {[i for i, x in enumerate(test_list) if x == 2]})\")\n    print(f\"1's count: {test_list.count(1)} (positions in input: {[i for i, x in enumerate(test_list) if x == 1]})\")\n    print(f\"0's count: {test_list.count(0)} (positions in input: {[i for i, x in enumerate(test_list) if x == 0]})\")\n\nanalyze_sequences()\n```\n\nAfter this final analysis, I can confirm:\n1. The rule is purely about sorting in descending order (2's, then 1's, then 0's)\n2. The original positions of numbers in the input don't affect their positions in the output\n3. For the test input with 2 twos, 5 ones, and 8 zeros, the output should be:\n   - First 2 positions: 2's\n   - Next 5 positions: 1's\n   - Last 8 positions: 0's\n\n<<<2 2 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>",
    "The code output confirms my analysis. Let me summarize why I'm confident about the answer:\n\n1. Looking at the original examples and test input:\n   - The rule is a straightforward descending sort (2's → 1's → 0's)\n   - The count of each digit in the output matches exactly with the input\n   - The original positions of the numbers in the input don't matter\n\n2. For the test input \"0 1 0 0 2 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 2 0\":\n   - We have 2 twos (at positions 4 and 13)\n   - We have 5 ones (at positions 1, 5, 9, 11, 12)\n   - We have 8 zeros (at positions 0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 14)\n\n3. Therefore, the output must be:\n   - First 2 positions: 2's\n   - Next 5 positions: 1's\n   - Last 8 positions: 0's\n\nThis pattern is consistent with all the example cases, and there are no additional rules or patterns that would affect the ordering within each number group.\n\n<<<2 2 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
