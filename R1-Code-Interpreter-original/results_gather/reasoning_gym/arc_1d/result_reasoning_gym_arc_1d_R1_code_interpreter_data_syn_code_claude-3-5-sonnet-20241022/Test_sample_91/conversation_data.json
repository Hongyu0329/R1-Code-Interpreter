    "Let me analyze this pattern step by step.\n\n1) First, let's look at the examples carefully:\n- Example 1: [7,5] moves 3 positions to the right\n- Example 2: [1,7] moves 3 positions to the right\n- Example 3: [6,6,1,3,3,6,9,6,4] moves 3 positions to the right\n\n2) Common pattern observations:\n- All non-zero sequences move 3 positions to the right\n- The rest of the positions are filled with zeros\n- The sequence maintains its relative order\n- If numbers would move beyond the grid boundary, they are truncated\n\n3) Let's write code to verify this pattern and apply it to the test case:\n\n```python\ndef shift_pattern(input_grid):\n    # Convert input string to list of numbers\n    grid = [int(x) for x in input_grid.split()]\n    \n    # Find non-zero sequence\n    non_zeros = []\n    for num in grid:\n        if num != 0:\n            non_zeros.append(num)\n    \n    # Create output grid (all zeros)\n    output = [0] * 18\n    \n    # Place non-zero sequence shifted 3 positions right\n    start_pos = 0\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        if grid[i] != 0:\n            start_pos = i\n            break\n    \n    # Place numbers shifted 3 positions to the right\n    new_start = start_pos + 3\n    for i in range(len(non_zeros)):\n        if new_start + i < len(output):\n            output[new_start + i] = non_zeros[i]\n    \n    # Convert to string\n    return ' '.join(map(str, output))\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = \"7 2 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"\nprint(test_input)\nprint(shift_pattern(test_input))\n```\n\n4) The code:\n- Identifies the non-zero sequence\n- Shifts it 3 positions to the right\n- Maintains the sequence order\n- Fills remaining positions with zeros\n- Handles truncation if sequence would go beyond grid boundary\n\n5) For the test input [7,2,7], applying the rule:\n- Original position starts at index 0\n- Shift 3 positions right\n- The sequence [7,2,7] will start at index 3\n\nBased on the code execution and pattern analysis, I can now provide the answer:\n\n<<<0 0 0 7 2 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>",
    "The code execution confirms my analysis and the answer I provided.\n\nLet me verify why this is correct:\n1) The input grid has a sequence [7,2,7] starting at position 0\n2) Following the rule we identified (shift 3 positions right), this sequence should move 3 positions to the right\n3) The rest of the positions should be filled with zeros\n4) The output shows exactly this: three zeros followed by [7,2,7], followed by all zeros\n\nThe code execution matches the expected output, and therefore I can confidently confirm my answer:\n\n<<<0 0 0 7 2 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
