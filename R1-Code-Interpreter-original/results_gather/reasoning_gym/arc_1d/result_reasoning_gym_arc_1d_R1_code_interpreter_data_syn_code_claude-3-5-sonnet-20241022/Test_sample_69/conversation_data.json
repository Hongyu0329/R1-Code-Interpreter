    "Let me analyze the patterns in the examples and derive the rule.\n\n1. First, let's analyze what changes between input and output:\n\nExample 1: A sequence of 1's shifts left by 1 position\nExample 2: A sequence of 4's shifts left by 1 position\nExample 3: A sequence of 5's has the last 5 moved to the end\n\nCommon observations:\n1. The total count of non-zero numbers remains the same\n2. The pattern seems to involve shifting sequences of same numbers\n3. There might be a \"wrap-around\" rule when numbers are at the end\n\nLet me write code to analyze these patterns more systematically:\n\n```python\ndef analyze_pattern(input_str, output_str):\n    input_list = [int(x) for x in input_str.split()]\n    output_list = [int(x) for x in output_str.split()]\n    \n    # Find sequences of non-zero numbers\n    def find_sequences(lst):\n        sequences = []\n        current_seq = []\n        current_num = None\n        \n        for i, num in enumerate(lst):\n            if num != 0:\n                if num != current_num:\n                    if current_seq:\n                        sequences.append(current_seq)\n                    current_seq = [num]\n                    current_num = num\n                else:\n                    current_seq.append(num)\n            else:\n                if current_seq:\n                    sequences.append(current_seq)\n                    current_seq = []\n                    current_num = None\n        if current_seq:\n            sequences.append(current_seq)\n        return sequences\n\n    # Analyze examples\n    input_seqs = find_sequences(input_list)\n    output_seqs = find_sequences(output_list)\n    \n    print(f\"Input sequences: {input_seqs}\")\n    print(f\"Output sequences: {output_seqs}\")\n    print(\"Length comparison:\", len(input_list), len(output_list))\n    \n# Test with example 1\nprint(\"Example 1:\")\nanalyze_pattern(\"0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\",\n                \"1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\")\n\nprint(\"\\nExample 2:\")\nanalyze_pattern(\"4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\",\n                \"4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\")\n\nprint(\"\\nExample 3:\")\nanalyze_pattern(\"5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\",\n                \"5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5\")\n\n# Analyze test input\nprint(\"\\nTest Input:\")\nanalyze_pattern(\"4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\", \"\")\n```\n\nAfter analyzing the patterns, I can see the rule:\n1. For each sequence of same numbers:\n   - If it's at the start/middle: Move the last number of the sequence one position to the left\n   - If it's at the end: Move the last number to the very end of the grid\n\nLet me write code to apply this rule to the test input:\n\n```python\ndef apply_rule(input_str):\n    input_list = [int(x) for x in input_str.split()]\n    output_list = input_list.copy()\n    \n    # Find sequences and their positions\n    current_seq_start = None\n    current_num = None\n    sequences = []  # Store (start, end) indices\n    \n    for i, num in enumerate(input_list):\n        if num != 0:\n            if num != current_num:\n                if current_seq_start is not None:\n                    sequences.append((current_seq_start, i-1))\n                current_seq_start = i\n                current_num = num\n        else:\n            if current_seq_start is not None:\n                sequences.append((current_seq_start, i-1))\n                current_seq_start = None\n                current_num = None\n    \n    if current_seq_start is not None:\n        sequences.append((current_seq_start, len(input_list)-1))\n    \n    # Apply the rule to each sequence\n    for start, end in sequences:\n        if end == len(input_list) - 1:  # Last sequence\n            # Move last number to end\n            val = output_list[end]\n            for i in range(end, start-1, -1):\n                output_list[i] = 0\n            output_list[-1] = val\n        else:\n            # Move last number one position left\n            if start > 0:  # Only if there's space to move left\n                output_list[start-1] = output_list[end]\n                output_list[end] = 0\n    \n    return ' '.join(map(str, output_list))\n\ntest_input = \"4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\"\nresult = apply_rule(test_input)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nBased on the analysis and the rule application, I can now provide the answer:\n\n<<<4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4>>>",
    "Let me revise my analysis based on the code output.\n\nLooking at the sequences more carefully:\n\nExample 1:\n- Input: One sequence of twelve 1's starting at position 1\n- Output: Same sequence, but starting at position 0 (shifted left by 1)\n\nExample 2:\n- Input: Two sequences of eleven 4's\n- Output: First sequence becomes ten 4's, second sequence becomes twelve 4's\n- The gap between sequences remains at the same position\n\nExample 3:\n- Input: One sequence of twenty 5's\n- Output: Nineteen 5's in original position, one 5 moved to the end\n\nThe rule appears to be:\n1.

    "I notice that my previous answer had an extra '4' at the end.

For any sequence at the start:\n   - Remove the last number of the sequence\n2. For any sequence at the end:\n   - Add that removed number to extend the sequence\n3. The total count of non-zero numbers remains the same\n\nFor the test input:\n[4x5, 0x11, 4x11]\nShould become:\n[4x4, 0x11, 4x12]\n\nThe code output is correct, and therefore:\n\n<<<4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4>>>"
