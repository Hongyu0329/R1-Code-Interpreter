    "Let me analyze the pattern and derive the rule from the given examples.\n\nThinking process:\n1. First, let's understand what happens in each example:\n   * Example 1: Seven 7's move left by 1 position\n   * Example 2: Five 7's move left by 1 position\n   * Example 3: Eight 4's move left by 1 position\n\n2. Common patterns observed:\n   * The sequence of non-zero numbers moves one position to the left\n   * The length of the non-zero sequence remains the same\n   * The rest of the positions are filled with zeros\n   * The original sequence maintains its order\n\n3. Let's write code to:\n   * Find the non-zero sequence in the input\n   * Move it left by one position\n   * Fill the rest with zeros\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find non-zero sequence\n    non_zeros = [x for x in input_grid if x != 0]\n    \n    # Create output grid\n    output = []\n    \n    # Add leading zero\n    output.append(0)\n    \n    # Add non-zero sequence\n    output.extend(non_zeros)\n    \n    # Fill remaining positions with zeros\n    while len(output) < len(input_grid):\n        output.append(0)\n    \n    return output\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nresult = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n```\n\nBased on the code execution and pattern analysis:\n1. In the test input, we have a single '3' at position 2\n2. Following the rule, this '3' should move one position to the left\n3. The rest of the positions should be filled with zeros\n\n<<<0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>",
    "The code execution confirms my analysis, and the answer appears to be correct. Let me verify one more time:\n\n1. Looking at the test input: 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   * There is a single '3' at position 2\n   * All other positions are zeros\n\n2. Applying the derived rule:\n   * The non-zero sequence (just a single '3') should move one position to the left\n   * The length of the sequence remains the same (one digit)\n   * The rest of the positions should be filled with zeros\n\n3. The output shows:\n   * The '3' has moved one position to the left (from position 2 to position 1)\n   * All other positions are zeros\n   * The total length remains the same (13 positions)\n\nThis matches perfectly with the pattern observed in the example cases, where:\n* The non-zero sequence always shifts one position to the left\n* The sequence maintains its value and order\n* The rest is filled with zeros\n\nTherefore, I can confidently confirm the answer:\n\n<<<0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
