    "Let me analyze the pattern and derive the rule from the given examples.\n\n1) First, let's analyze what happens in each example:\n- Example 1: A single 4 expands to multiple 4s to the right\n- Example 2: Two 4s create a bridge of 4s between them\n- Example 3: Two 2s create a bridge of 2s between them\n\n2) The pattern seems to be:\n- When there are two same non-zero numbers, fill all positions between them with that number\n- When there's only one non-zero number, fill all positions to the right with that number\n\nLet me write code to verify this pattern and apply it to the test input:\n\n```python\ndef process_grid(input_grid):\n    n = len(input_grid)\n    output = input_grid.copy()\n    \n    # Find all non-zero numbers and their positions\n    numbers = {}\n    for i, num in enumerate(input_grid):\n        if num != 0:\n            if num not in numbers:\n                numbers[num] = []\n            numbers[num].append(i)\n    \n    # Process each unique number\n    for num, positions in numbers.items():\n        if len(positions) == 1:  # Single number case\n            # Fill all positions to the right\n            for i in range(positions[0], n):\n                output[i] = num\n        elif len(positions) == 2:  # Two numbers case\n            # Fill positions between the two numbers\n            for i in range(positions[0], positions[1] + 1):\n                output[i] = num\n    \n    return output\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9]\n\n# Process and print result\nresult = process_grid(test_input)\nprint(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n```\n\nBased on the code execution and the pattern we identified:\n1) We have two 9s in the test input\n2) Following the rule, we should fill all positions between these two 9s with 9s\n3) The first 9 appears at position 17 and the second at position 21\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9>>>",
    "The code execution matches my reasoning. Let me verify if this is the correct interpretation by double-checking the examples:\n\n1) Example 1: Single 4 → filled all positions to the right with 4s ✓\n2) Example 2: Two 4s → filled positions between them with 4s ✓\n3) Example 3: Two 2s → filled positions between them with 2s ✓\n\nFor the test input:\n- We have two 9s (at positions 17 and 21)\n- Following the rule, we filled all positions between and including these positions with 9s\n- The output shows 0s until position 17, then 9s from position 17 through 21\n\nThe code output matches the pattern observed in all examples and correctly applies the rule to the test input. I am confident in the answer.\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9>>>"
