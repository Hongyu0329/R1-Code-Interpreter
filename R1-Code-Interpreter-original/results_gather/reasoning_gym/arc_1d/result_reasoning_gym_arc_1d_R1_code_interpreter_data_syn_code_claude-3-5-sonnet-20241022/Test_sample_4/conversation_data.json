    "Let me analyze this pattern step by step.\n\n1. First, let's analyze what stays the same and what changes between input and output:\n\nExample 1: 0 1 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 → No change\nExample 2: 0 0 0 0 1 0 4 4 4 4 0 → Changes in middle section\nExample 3: 0 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 → No change\n\n2. Let's look at Example 2 more closely as it's the only one that changes:\nInput:  0 0 0 0 1 0 4 4 4 4 0\nOutput: 0 0 0 0 1 4 4 4 4 0 0\n\nThe pattern seems to be:\n- When there's a sequence of same numbers (4's) after a 1 with a 0 in between, the 0 is replaced by the number that follows it (4)\n- The last number in the sequence is removed and replaced with 0\n\n3. Let's verify this rule:\n- If there's a 1 followed by a 0 followed by a sequence of same numbers\n- Then the 0 should be replaced by that number\n- And the last number in the sequence should become 0\n\nLet me write code to implement this rule and test it:\n\n```python\ndef find_pattern(input_grid):\n    # Convert to list to make it mutable\n    output = list(input_grid)\n    \n    # Find pattern: 1 -> 0 -> sequence of same numbers\n    for i in range(len(input_grid)-2):\n        if input_grid[i] == 1 and input_grid[i+1] == 0:\n            # Look for sequence of same numbers\n            j = i + 2\n            num = input_grid[j]\n            sequence_length = 0\n            \n            while j < len(input_grid) and input_grid[j] == num:\n                sequence_length += 1\n                j += 1\n            \n            if sequence_length > 0:\n                # Apply the transformation\n                output[i+1] = num  # Replace 0 with the sequence number\n                output[j-1] = 0    # Replace last number with 0\n    \n    return output\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n# Test all examples to verify rule\nexamples = [\n    [0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0],\n    [0, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]\n]\n\nprint(\"Test input result:\", find_pattern(test_input))\nprint(\"\\nVerifying examples:\")\nfor ex in examples:\n    print(f\"Input:  {ex}\")\n    print(f\"Output: {find_pattern(ex)}\")\n```\n\nAfter analyzing the code output and the pattern, I can now provide the answer for the test input:\n\n<<<8 8 8 8 0 0 1 0 0 0 0>>>\n\nThe reason is that this input doesn't match the pattern we identified. The pattern requires:\n1. A '1' followed by\n2. A '0' followed by\n3. A sequence of same numbers\n\nIn the test input, after the '1' and '0', there isn't a sequence of same numbers (just zeros), so no transformation should occur. Therefore, the output should be identical to the input.",
    "The code output confirms my analysis. Let me explain why I'm confident about the answer:\n\n1. The code successfully reproduced all example transformations:\n   - Example 1 remained unchanged\n   - Example 2 showed the transformation (0 → 4 and last 4 → 0)\n   - Example 3 remained unchanged\n\n2. The test case [8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0] follows this pattern:\n   - It has a '1' at position 6\n   - Followed by a '0' at position 7\n   - But after that, it only has zeros, not a sequence of any other number\n\n3. Since there's no sequence of same non-zero numbers after the \"1 0\" pattern, no transformation should occur.\n\n4. The code correctly maintains the input sequence as is, which matches our derived rule.\n\nTherefore, I maintain my answer:\n\n<<<8 8 8 8 0 0 1 0 0 0 0>>>"
