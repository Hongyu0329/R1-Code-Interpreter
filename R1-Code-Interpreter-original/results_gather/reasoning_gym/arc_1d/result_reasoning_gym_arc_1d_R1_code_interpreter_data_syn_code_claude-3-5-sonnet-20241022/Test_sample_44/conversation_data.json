    "Let me analyze the patterns in the examples and derive the rule.\n\n1) First, let's analyze what happens in each example:\n   * Example 1: A sequence of 6's gets extended by one position to the right\n   * Example 2: A sequence of 9's gets extended by one position to the left\n   * Example 3: A sequence of 9's gets extended by one position to the right\n\n2) Common observations:\n   * There's always a '2' in the input that seems to act as a marker\n   * The number sequence before or after the '2' gets extended by one position\n   * The direction of extension seems to be towards the '2'\n   * The extension copies the number that's adjacent to the '2'\n\n3) The rule appears to be:\n   * Find the position of '2' in the input\n   * Look at the numbers on both sides of '2'\n   * If there's a sequence of same numbers adjacent to '2', extend that sequence by one position (replacing the '2')\n\nLet's write code to verify this pattern and apply it to the test case:\n\n```python\ndef find_pattern(input_grid):\n    # Convert input string to list\n    grid = input_grid.split()\n    grid = [int(x) for x in grid]\n    \n    # Find position of 2\n    marker_pos = grid.index(2)\n    \n    # Create output grid\n    output = grid.copy()\n    \n    # Check left side\n    left_num = grid[marker_pos - 1] if marker_pos > 0 else 0\n    right_num = grid[marker_pos + 1] if marker_pos < len(grid) - 1 else 0\n    \n    # If there's a sequence on the left\n    if left_num != 0:\n        output[marker_pos] = left_num\n    # If there's a sequence on the right\n    elif right_num != 0:\n        output[marker_pos] = right_num\n    \n    # Convert back to string\n    return ' '.join(map(str, output))\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0\"\nprint(find_pattern(test_input))\n```\n\nLooking at the test input:\n* We have a '2' at position 9\n* To its right, we have a sequence of 3's\n* Following the pattern we found, the '2' should be replaced with a '3'\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0>>>",
