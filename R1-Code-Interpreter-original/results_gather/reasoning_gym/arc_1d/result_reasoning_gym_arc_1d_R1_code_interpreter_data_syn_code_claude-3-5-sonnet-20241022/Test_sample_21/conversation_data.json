    "Thank you for the code output. Let me analyze this more carefully:\n\nLooking at the changes in each example:\n\n1. Example 1 shows:\n   - First two 8s become 0s\n   - Four 0s (positions 5-8) become 8s\n   - Last two 8s become 0s\n   This creates a symmetrical pattern where 0s are pushed to ends.\n\n2. Example 2 shows:\n   - The 0 at position 8 moves to position 4\n   - The rest remains 6s\n   This suggests a rule about moving isolated zeros.\n\n3.

When there's a sequence of same non-zero numbers (like 6s) with a single zero, the zero moves to position 4\n2. When there's a long sequence of zeros with a pair of same numbers, the pattern remains unchanged\n3. When there's a symmetrical pattern of non-zero numbers surrounding zeros, it creates a symmetrical output\n\nLooking at our test input [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,0,0,0,0,0]:\n- It has a long sequence of zeros\n- Followed by a pair of 6s\n- Followed by more zeros\n- This pattern doesn't match any of the transformation rules that would cause a change\n- Therefore, the output should be identical to the input\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0>>>",

The test input has three sequences: [0×17] + [6×2] + [0×5]\n2.
