    "Let me analyze the pattern and derive the rule by examining the given examples.\n\nLet's break down what happens in each example:\n\n1. Example 1:\n   - A single '0' moves one position to the right\n   - All other numbers (5s) stay in their positions\n\n2. Example 2:\n   - Two '0's at the start move one position to the right\n   - Two '0's at the end move one position to the left\n   - The middle numbers (2s) maintain their sequence\n\n3. Example 3:\n   - Three '0's at the start move one position to the right\n   - Three '0's at the end stay in their positions\n   - The middle numbers (3s) maintain their sequence but shift right\n\nLet me write code to analyze these patterns and verify the rule:\n\n```python\ndef analyze_pattern(input_str, output_str):\n    input_list = input_str.split()\n    output_list = output_str.split()\n    \n    # Count consecutive zeros from start and end\n    def count_zeros(lst, from_start=True):\n        count = 0\n        idx = 0 if from_start else len(lst)-1\n        step = 1 if from_start else -1\n        while 0 <= idx < len(lst) and lst[idx] == '0':\n            count += 1\n            idx += step\n        return count\n    \n    # Print analysis\n    print(f\"Input: {input_list}\")\n    print(f\"Output: {output_list}\")\n    print(f\"Leading zeros: {count_zeros(input_list)} -> {count_zeros(output_list)}\")\n    print(f\"Trailing zeros: {count_zeros(input_list, False)} -> {count_zeros(output_list, False)}\")\n    print(\"---\")\n\n# Analyze examples\nexamples = [\n    (\"5 5 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 5 5\", \"5 5 5 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 5\"),\n    (\"0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0\", \"0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0\"),\n    (\"0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\", \"0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0\")\n]\n\nfor input_str, output_str in examples:\n    analyze_pattern(input_str, output_str)\n\n# Analyze test case\ntest_input = \"6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6\"\nprint(\"Test case analysis:\")\nanalyze_pattern(test_input, \"\")\n```\n\nAfter analyzing the patterns, I can see the following rule:\n1. When there's a sequence of zeros, they tend to shift one position towards the non-zero numbers\n2. The non-zero numbers maintain their relative positions\n3. The total length of the sequence remains the same\n4. The number of zeros remains the same\n\nFor the test input \"6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6\":\n- We have three 6s at the start\n- Eight consecutive zeros in the middle\n- One 6 at the end\n- Following the pattern, the zeros should shift one position left towards the start\n\nTherefore, I can determine the output:\n\n<<<6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>",
    "I apologize for my previous analysis. Let me revise my approach after seeing the code output more clearly.\n\nLet's analyze the patterns again:\n\n1. Example 1:\n   - A single '0' moves one position to the right\n   - All other numbers (5s) maintain their positions\n\n2. Example 2:\n   - The sequence of zeros in the middle shifts one position to the right\n   - The 2s maintain their sequence but adjust to accommodate the shift\n\n3. Example 3:\n   - The sequence of zeros in the middle shifts one position to the right\n   - The 3s maintain their sequence but adjust to accommodate the shift\n\nLet me write a more precise analysis code:\n\n```python\ndef find_pattern(input_str):\n    # Convert string to list\n    nums = input_str.split()\n    \n    # Find the longest sequence of zeros and its position\n    max_zero_seq = 0\n    max_zero_start = -1\n    current_seq = 0\n    \n    for i in range(len(nums)):\n        if nums[i] == '0':\n            current_seq += 1\n            if current_seq > max_zero_seq:\n                max_zero_seq = current_seq\n                max_zero_start = i - current_seq + 1\n        else:\n            current_seq = 0\n    \n    # Create output by shifting the zero sequence right\n    output = nums.copy()\n    non_zero = [x for x in nums if x != '0']\n    zero_count = nums.count('0')\n    \n    # Reconstruct the output\n    result = []\n    zero_placed = 0\n    non_zero_idx = 0\n    \n    for i in range(len(nums)):\n        if i < max_zero_start + 1 or i >= max_zero_start + zero_count + 1:\n            if non_zero_idx < len(non_zero):\n                result.append(non_zero[non_zero_idx])\n                non_zero_idx += 1\n        else:\n            result.append('0')\n            zero_placed += 1\n    \n    print(f\"Input: {nums}\")\n    print(f\"Output: {result}\")\n    return ' '.join(result)\n\n# Test with the given input\ntest_input = \"6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6\"\noutput = find_pattern(test_input)\n```\n\nAfter analyzing the pattern more carefully, I can see that:\n1. The main rule is that the longest consecutive sequence of zeros shifts one position to the right\n2. The non-zero numbers maintain their relative order\n3. The shift of zeros is always by one position\n\nFor the test input \"6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6\":\n- We have a sequence of 8 zeros in the middle\n- Following the pattern, this sequence should shift one position to the right\n- The 6s should maintain their relative positions\n\n<<<6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>",
    "The code execution confirms my analysis was correct. Let me summarize why this is the right answer:\n\n1. Looking at all examples, the consistent pattern is:\n   - Example 1: The zero shifts right by one position (5 5 5 5 5 0 5... → 5 5 5 5 5 5 0...)\n   - Example 2: The zeros shift right by one position (0 0 0 2... → 0 0 0 0 2...)\n   - Example 3: The zeros shift right by one position (0 0 0 3... → 0 0 0 0 3...)\n\n2. For our test input \"6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6\":\n   - We have three 6s at the start\n   - Eight consecutive zeros\n   - One 6 at the end\n   - Following the consistent pattern, the sequence of zeros should shift one position to the right\n   - This means one of the ending 6s needs to move to before the zero sequence\n   - The zeros maintain their consecutive sequence\n\n3. The code correctly generated:\n   - The first four positions are now 6s (three original plus one from the end)\n   - Followed by all eight zeros\n   - The last 6 from the input moves to position 4 (before the zeros)\n\nThis follows the exact same pattern as all example cases, where the zero sequence shifts one position to the right, and the non-zero numbers adjust accordingly while maintaining their relative order.\n\n<<<6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
