    "Let me analyze this pattern step by step.\n\n1. First, let's observe the patterns in the examples:\n   * All outputs seem to be sorted in some way\n   * The numbers used are only 0, 1, and 2\n   * The frequency of each number remains the same between input and output\n   * In the outputs, 2s appear first, then 1s, then 0s\n\n2. Let's verify this hypothesis by counting numbers and checking their order:\n\n```python\ndef analyze_patterns():\n    # Example inputs and outputs\n    inputs = [\n        [2,0,2,0,0,0,2,2,0,2,1],\n        [2,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,2,1],\n        [0,0,0,1,2,0,2,1,0,2,0],\n    ]\n    outputs = [\n        [2,2,2,2,2,1,0,0,0,0,0],\n        [2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0],\n        [2,2,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    ]\n    \n    for i in range(len(inputs)):\n        input_counts = {0: inputs[i].count(0), 1: inputs[i].count(1), 2: inputs[i].count(2)}\n        output_counts = {0: outputs[i].count(0), 1: outputs[i].count(1), 2: outputs[i].count(2)}\n        print(f\"Example {i+1}:\")\n        print(f\"Input counts: {input_counts}\")\n        print(f\"Output counts: {output_counts}\")\n        print(\"---\")\n\n    # Test input\n    test = [0,0,0,2,2,2,0,2,0,0,0]\n    test_counts = {0: test.count(0), 1: test.count(1), 2: test.count(2)}\n    print(\"Test input counts:\", test_counts)\n\nanalyze_patterns()\n```\n\n3. After analyzing the patterns, the rule becomes clear:\n   * Count the frequency of each number (0,1,2) in the input\n   * In the output:\n     - Place all 2s first\n     - Then place all 1s\n     - Finally place all 0s\n\n4. Let's generate the output for the test input:\n\n```python\ndef generate_output(input_list):\n    # Count frequencies\n    count_2 = input_list.count(2)\n    count_1 = input_list.count(1)\n    count_0 = input_list.count(0)\n    \n    # Generate output according to the rule\n    output = [2] * count_2 + [1] * count_1 + [0] * count_0\n    print(\" \".join(map(str, output)))\n\ntest_input = [0,0,0,2,2,2,0,2,0,0,0]\ngenerate_output(test_input)\n```\n\nBased on the code execution and pattern analysis, I can now provide the final answer.\n\n<<<2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>",
    "The code output confirms my analysis. Let me explain why my answer is correct:\n\n1. From the test input counts, we have:\n   * Number of 2s: 4 (four 2s)\n   * Number of 1s: 0 (no 1s)\n   * Number of 0s: 7 (seven 0s)\n\n2. The rule is confirmed from all examples:\n   * All outputs maintain the same count of each number as their inputs\n   * The numbers are always arranged in descending order (2s, then 1s, then 0s)\n   * This creates a sorted output where higher numbers come first\n\n3. Therefore, for our test input [0,0,0,2,2,2,0,2,0,0,0] which has:\n   * 4 twos (2s)\n   * 0 ones (1s)\n   * 7 zeros (0s)\n\nThe output should be:\n* First 4 positions filled with 2s\n* No 1s (since there are none in the input)\n* Last 7 positions filled with 0s\n\nThis confirms my previous answer:\n\n<<<2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
