    "Let me analyze this pattern step by step.\n\n1) First, let's analyze what changes between input and output in each example:\n\nExample 1: \n- Input has 7s and 0s\n- Output keeps all leading 7s, but turns all trailing numbers into 0s after first 0\n\nExample 2:\n- Input has 1s and 0s\n- Output keeps all numbers the same except first 1 becomes 0\n\nExample 3:\n- Input has 1s and 0s\n- Output keeps all numbers the same but turns the last 1 into 0\n\nLet me write code to verify these patterns and find the common rule:\n\n```python\ndef analyze_pattern(input_str, output_str):\n    input_list = [int(x) for x in input_str.split()]\n    output_list = [int(x) for x in output_str.split()]\n    \n    # Print differences\n    print(\"Differences at positions:\")\n    for i in range(len(input_list)):\n        if input_list[i] != output_list[i]:\n            print(f\"Position {i}: {input_list[i]} -> {output_list[i]}\")\n    \n    # Analyze pattern\n    changes = []\n    for i in range(len(input_list)):\n        if input_list[i] != output_list[i]:\n            changes.append((i, input_list[i], output_list[i]))\n    \n    return changes\n\n# Example 1\nex1_in = \"0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 7 0 0 7 0 0 7 0\"\nex1_out = \"0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"\nprint(\"Example 1 changes:\")\nanalyze_pattern(ex1_in, ex1_out)\n\n# Example 2\nex2_in = \"1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\"\nex2_out = \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\"\nprint(\"\\nExample 2 changes:\")\nanalyze_pattern(ex2_in, ex2_out)\n\n# Example 3\nex3_in = \"0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\"\nex3_out = \"0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"\nprint(\"\\nExample 3 changes:\")\nanalyze_pattern(ex3_in, ex3_out)\n```\n\nAfter analyzing the patterns, I can see the rule:\n1. After encountering a zero, all subsequent non-zero numbers become zero in the output\n2. Numbers before the first zero remain unchanged\n3. Zeros always remain zeros\n\nLet me write code to apply this rule to the test input:\n\n```python\ndef apply_rule(input_str):\n    numbers = [int(x) for x in input_str.split()]\n    output = numbers.copy()\n    \n    # Find first zero\n    zero_found = False\n    for i in range(len(numbers)):\n        if zero_found and numbers[i] != 0:\n            output[i] = 0\n        if numbers[i] == 0:\n            zero_found = True\n    \n    return ' '.join(map(str, output))\n\ntest_input = \"0 5 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0\"\nresult = apply_rule(test_input)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nBased on the rule I found and the code execution, I can now provide the answer:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>",
    "Let me revise my analysis based on the code output.\n\nLooking at the differences more carefully:\n\nExample 1:\n- Changes positions 12, 15, and 18 from 7 to 0\n- These are all 7s that appear after the first 0\n\nExample 2:\n- Only changes position 0 from 1 to 0\n- This is the first 1 in the sequence\n\nExample 3:\n- Only changes position 18 from 1 to 0\n- This is the last 1 in the sequence\n\nI need to revise my initial rule.

If there's a non-zero number after a zero in the sequence, it becomes zero in the output\n2. All other numbers remain unchanged\n\nLet me apply this rule to the test input:\n\n```python\ndef apply_correct_rule(input_str):\n    numbers = [int(x) for x in input_str.split()]\n    output = numbers.copy()\n    \n    # Flag to track if we've seen a zero\n    seen_zero = False\n    \n    for i in range(len(numbers)):\n        if seen_zero and numbers[i] != 0:\n            output[i] = 0\n        if numbers[i] == 0:\n            seen_zero = True\n    \n    return ' '.join(map(str, output))\n\ntest_input = \"0 5 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0\"\nresult = apply_correct_rule(test_input)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nBased on the corrected rule and code execution, here's the final answer:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>",
    "Let me revise my analysis based on the new code output.\n\nLooking at the patterns more carefully:\n\nExample 1:\n- First non-zero stays at position 2\n- Last non-zero moves from position 18 to 10\n- 3 changes total\n\nExample 2:\n- First non-zero moves from position 0 to 6\n- Last non-zero stays at position 19\n- Only 1 change\n\nExample 3:\n- First non-zero stays at position 4\n- Last non-zero moves from position 18 to 10\n- Only 1 change\n\nNew insights:\n1. In Examples 1 and 3, the last non-zero number moves to position 10\n2. In Example 2, the first non-zero number moves\n3.
