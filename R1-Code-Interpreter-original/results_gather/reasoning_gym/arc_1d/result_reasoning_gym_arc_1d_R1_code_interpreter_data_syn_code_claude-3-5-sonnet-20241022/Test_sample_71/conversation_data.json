    "Let me analyze the patterns in the examples and derive the rule.\n\n1) First, let's analyze what changes between input and output:\n\nExample 1: \"6 6 6\" block and \"2\" moved positions\nExample 2: \"4 4\" block and \"2\" moved positions\nExample 3: \"9\" and \"2\" moved positions\n\n2) Key observations:\n- Numbers greater than 0 appear to move positions\n- Some numbers appear in blocks (consecutive same numbers)\n- The \"2\" seems to be a special number that appears in all examples\n- The total count of each number remains the same\n- The relative order of different number blocks seems to change\n\n3) Let's write code to analyze the patterns more systematically:\n\n```python\ndef analyze_movement(input_str, output_str):\n    input_grid = [int(x) for x in input_str.split()]\n    output_grid = [int(x) for x in output_str.split()]\n    \n    # Find positions of non-zero numbers\n    def find_blocks(grid):\n        blocks = []\n        current_block = []\n        current_num = 0\n        \n        for i, num in enumerate(grid):\n            if num != 0:\n                if num == current_num:\n                    current_block.append(i)\n                else:\n                    if current_block:\n                        blocks.append((current_num, current_block))\n                    current_block = [i]\n                    current_num = num\n            else:\n                if current_block:\n                    blocks.append((current_num, current_block))\n                    current_block = []\n                    current_num = 0\n        if current_block:\n            blocks.append((current_num, current_block))\n        return blocks\n\n    print(\"Example analysis:\")\n    print(\"Input blocks:\", find_blocks(input_grid))\n    print(\"Output blocks:\", find_blocks(output_grid))\n\n# Analyze all examples\nprint(\"Example 1:\")\nanalyze_movement(\"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 6 6 6 0 0\", \"0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\")\nprint(\"\\nExample 2:\")\nanalyze_movement(\"0 0 0 0 0 4 4 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\", \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\")\nprint(\"\\nExample 3:\")\nanalyze_movement(\"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 9\", \"0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\")\n```\n\nAfter analyzing the patterns, I can see the rule:\n1. The number \"2\" acts as a pivot point\n2. Any block of numbers that appears after \"2\" in the input moves to before \"2\" in the output\n3. The relative positions of blocks that move are maintained (same number of zeros between them)\n4. Blocks maintain their internal structure (consecutive same numbers stay together)\n\nFor the test input \"0 0 0 0 2 0 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\":\n- \"2\" is at position 4\n- \"7 7 7\" block appears after \"2\"\n- Following the rule, \"7 7 7\" should move before \"2\"\n- Other positions remain filled with zeros\n\nTherefore:\n\n<<<0 0 7 7 7 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>",
    "The code output confirms my analysis. Let me break down what we learned from the code:\n\n1. Example 1:\n- Input: \"2\" at position 9, \"6 6 6\" block at positions 11-13\n- Output: \"6 6 6\" block moved to positions 5-7, \"2\" stayed at position 9\n\n2. Example 2:\n- Input: \"4 4\" block at positions 5-6, \"2\" at position 7\n- Output: \"2\" stayed at position 7, \"4 4\" block moved to positions 8-9\n\n3. Example 3:\n- Input: \"2\" at position 9, \"9\" at position 15\n- Output: \"9\" moved to position 3, \"2\" stayed at position 9\n\nI need to revise my earlier understanding. The actual rule appears to be:\n\n1. The number \"2\" acts as a fixed pivot point (it doesn't move)\n2. For numbers that appear before \"2\" in the input, they stay before \"2\" in the output\n3. For numbers that appear after \"2\" in the input:\n   - If they're a single number, they move to a position before \"2\"\n   - If they're a block of numbers, they move as a block to a position before \"2\"\n4. The relative distance from \"2\" is somewhat preserved in the new positions\n\nLet's verify this with the test input \"0 0 0 0 2 0 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\":\n- \"2\" is at position 4 (will stay there)\n- \"7 7 7\" block appears after \"2\" (positions 6-8)\n- Following the rule, \"7 7 7\" should move to before \"2\"\n- The block should maintain its structure\n\nTherefore, I revise my answer:\n\n<<<0 0 7 7 7 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
