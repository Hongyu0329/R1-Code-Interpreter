    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations:\n1. The output grid is a shifted version of the input grid.\n2. The non-zero sequence in the input grid is shifted to the left by one position in the output grid.\n3. The first non-zero element in the input grid becomes the first non-zero element in the output grid, but shifted one position to the left.\n4. The last non-zero element in the input grid is removed in the output grid.\n\n### Rule:\n- Identify the sequence of non-zero elements in the input grid.\n- Shift this sequence one position to the left in the output grid.\n- The last non-zero element in the input grid is not included in the output grid.\n\n### Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9\n\n### Applying the Rule:\n- The non-zero sequence is 9 9 9 9 9 9.\n- Shift this sequence one position to the left: 9 9 9 9 9.\n- The output grid will be: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 0 0\n\n### Final Answer:\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 0 0>>>"
