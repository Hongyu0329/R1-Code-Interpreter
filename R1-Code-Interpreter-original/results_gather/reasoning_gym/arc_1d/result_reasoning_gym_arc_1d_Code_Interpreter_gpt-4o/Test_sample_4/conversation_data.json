    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 1 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 1 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0\n\nThe input and output are identical.\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 1 0 4 4 4 4 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 1 4 4 4 4 0 0\n\nThe output is the same as the input except that the first occurrence of the number '4' (after the '1') is moved to the position immediately after '1', and the trailing '0' is moved to the end.\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n- **Output:** 0 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n\nThe input and output are identical.\n\n### Observations:\n- If the sequence after the first non-zero number is uniform (like all 2s or all 6s), the output is identical to the input.\n- If there is a non-zero number followed by a different number (like '1' followed by '4'), the first occurrence of the different number is moved to the position immediately after the first non-zero number, and the trailing zero is moved to the end.\n\n### Rule:\n1. Identify the first non-zero number in the sequence.\n2. If the sequence after this number is uniform, the output is identical to the input.\n3. If there is a different number after the first non-zero number, move the first occurrence of this different number to the position immediately after the first non-zero number, and move the trailing zero to the end.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 8 8 8 8 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n\n1. The first non-zero number is '8'.\n2. The sequence after '8' is not uniform because there is a '1' after the zeros.\n3. Move the '1' to the position immediately after the first '8', and move the trailing zero to the end.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n# Applying the rule\noutput_grid = input_grid.copy()\n\n# Find the first non-zero number\nfirst_non_zero_index = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), None)\n\n# If there is a different number after the first non-zero number\nif first_non_zero_index is not None:\n    first_non_zero = input_grid[first_non_zero_index]\n    for i in range(first_non_zero_index + 1, len(input_grid)):\n        if input_grid[i] != first_non_zero and input_grid[i] != 0:\n            # Move the first occurrence of the different number\n            output_grid[first_non_zero_index + 1] = input_grid[i]\n            # Move the trailing zero to the end\n            output_grid[i] = 0\n            break\n\noutput_grid\nassistant > The output grid for the test input, after applying the identified rule, is:\n\n<<<8 1 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
