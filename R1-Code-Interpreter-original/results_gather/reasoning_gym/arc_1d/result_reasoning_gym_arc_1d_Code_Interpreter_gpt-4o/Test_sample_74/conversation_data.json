    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 5 0 8 8 0 4 0 8\n- **Output:** 0 0 5 0 5 5 0 5 0 5\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 6 2 6 0 7 2 0 3 0\n- **Output:** 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 0\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 9 5 7 3 3 6 0 0 0 3\n- **Output:** 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 5\n\n### Observations:\n1. In all examples, the number `5` appears frequently in the output grid.\n2. The number `5` seems to replace certain numbers in the input grid.\n3. In Example 1, the number `8` in the input is replaced by `5` in the output.\n4. In Example 2, the numbers `6`, `2`, `7`, and `3` in the input are replaced by `5` in the output.\n5. In Example 3, the numbers `9`, `5`, `7`, `3`, and `6` in the input are replaced by `5` in the output.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n- It appears that any non-zero number in the input grid is replaced by `5` in the output grid.\n- The number `0` remains unchanged in the output grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule:\nFor the test input grid:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 8 0 7 9 7 0\n\nUsing the derived rule:\n- Replace any non-zero number with `5`.\n- Keep `0` as `0`.\n\n### Test Output Grid:\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 5 0 5 5 5 0\n\nThus, the predicted output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 5 0 5 5 5 0>>>"
