    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 2 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n- **Output:** 2 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2 2\n- **Output:** 2 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 2 1 0 2 0 0 1 2 1 0 2 2 2\n- **Output:** 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations:\n1. The output grid always starts with a sequence of 2s followed by 1s, and then 0s.\n2. The number of 2s in the output seems to correspond to the number of 2s in the input.\n3. The number of 1s in the output seems to correspond to the number of 1s in the input.\n4. The rest of the output is filled with 0s.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n- Count the number of 2s in the input grid. This count determines the number of 2s at the start of the output grid.\n- Count the number of 1s in the input grid. This count determines the number of 1s following the 2s in the output grid.\n- Fill the remaining positions in the output grid with 0s.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 2 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2 1 1\n  - Number of 2s: 3\n  - Number of 1s: 5\n\nUsing the rule, the output grid should be:\n- 3 twos: 2 2 2\n- 5 ones: 1 1 1 1 1\n- Remaining positions filled with 0s.\n\nThus, the output grid is:\n- **Output:** 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
