    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations:\n1. In Examples 1 and 2, the sequence of `2`s in the input grid is shifted to the left by 5 positions in the output grid.\n2. In Example 3, the sequence of `8`s in the input grid is shifted to the left by 1 position in the output grid.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n- The rule seems to involve shifting the sequence of non-zero numbers to the left. The number of positions to shift appears to be determined by the position of the first non-zero number in the input grid.\n- Specifically, the sequence of non-zero numbers is shifted to the position where the first non-zero number appears in the input grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0\n- The first non-zero number `7` appears at position 4.\n- Shift the sequence of `7`s to start at position 0.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input grid to find the output.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Test input grid\ntest_input = [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n\n# Find the first non-zero position\nfirst_non_zero_pos = next((i for i, x in enumerate(test_input) if x != 0), None)\n\n# Shift the sequence of non-zero numbers to the left\noutput_grid = [0] * len(test_input)\nif first_non_zero_pos is not None:\n    non_zero_sequence = [x for x in test_input if x != 0]\n    output_grid[:len(non_zero_sequence)] = non_zero_sequence\n\noutput_grid\nassistant > The output grid for the test input, based on the derived rule, is:\n\n<<<7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
