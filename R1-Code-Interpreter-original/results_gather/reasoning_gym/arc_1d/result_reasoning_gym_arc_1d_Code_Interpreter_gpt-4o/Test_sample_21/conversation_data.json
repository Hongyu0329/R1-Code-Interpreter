    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n- **Output:** 6 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n- **Output:** 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n### Observations:\n1. In Example 1, the sequence of 8s in the input is shifted to the right in the output, and the leading and trailing elements are replaced with 0s.\n2. In Example 2, the sequence of 6s is shifted to the right, and the leading element is replaced with 0.\n3. In Example 3, the sequence of 1s remains unchanged, indicating that if the sequence is uniform, no change is applied.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n- If the input grid contains a sequence of identical numbers, the sequence is shifted to the right by one position in the output grid.\n- The first element of the output grid is replaced with 0 if the sequence is shifted.\n- If the input grid is uniform (all elements are the same), the output grid remains unchanged.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe sequence of 6s is shifted to the right by one position, and the first element is replaced with 0.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input to determine the output.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Test input grid\ntest_input = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n# Apply the rule: shift the sequence of 6s to the right by one position\ntest_output = test_input.copy()\n\n# Find the first occurrence of the sequence of 6s\nstart_index = test_input.index(6)\n\n# Shift the sequence to the right by one position\ntest_output[start_index] = 0\ntest_output[start_index + 1] = 6\ntest_output[start_index + 2] = 6\n\ntest_output\nassistant > The output grid for the test input, after applying the derived rule, is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0>>>"
