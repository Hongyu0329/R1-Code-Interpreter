    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 1 5 6 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 1 5 6\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 3 9 1 4 3 7 5 2 1 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 9 3 9 1 4 3 7 5 2 1 9 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations:\n1. In Example 1, the non-zero sequence \"5 1 5 6\" is shifted to the end of the output grid.\n2. In Example 2, the non-zero number \"9\" is moved to the start of the output grid.\n3. In Example 3, the non-zero sequence \"9 3 9 1 4 3 7 5 2 1 9\" is shifted to the start of the output grid.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n- The rule seems to involve identifying a contiguous sequence of non-zero numbers in the input grid and shifting it to a specific position in the output grid.\n- If the sequence is at the start of the input, it is moved to the end of the output.\n- If the sequence is at the end of the input, it is moved to the start of the output.\n- If the sequence is in the middle, it is moved to the start of the output.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 8 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 7 2 8 4 5 1 8 2\n- The non-zero sequence \"8 1 2\" is at the start of the input grid.\n- According to the rule, this sequence should be moved to the end of the output grid.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input grid.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = [8, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 7, 2, 8, 4, 5, 1, 8, 2]\n\n# Identify the non-zero sequence at the start\nnon_zero_sequence = []\nfor num in input_grid:\n    if num != 0:\n        non_zero_sequence.append(num)\n    else:\n        break\n\n# Create the output grid by moving the non-zero sequence to the end\noutput_grid = input_grid[len(non_zero_sequence):] + non_zero_sequence\noutput_grid\nassistant > The output grid for the test input, after applying the derived rule, is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 7 2 8 4 5 1 8 2 8 1 2>>>"
