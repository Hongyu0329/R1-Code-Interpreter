    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 8 8 2 2 0 0 8 8 2 2 0 0 0\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 8 2 0 0 0 0 8 8 2 2 2 0 0\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 2 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 8 8 2 2 2 0 8 8 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations:\n1. The number `2` in the input grid is sometimes transformed into `8` in the output grid.\n2. The transformation from `2` to `8` seems to occur in pairs of consecutive `2`s.\n3. If there are two consecutive `2`s, they are transformed into `8 8` in the output.\n4. If a single `2` is not part of a pair, it remains `2` in the output.\n\n### Rule:\n- For each pair of consecutive `2`s in the input grid, transform them into `8 8` in the output grid.\n- If a `2` is not part of a pair, it remains `2`.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 2 2 2\n\nLet's apply the rule to the test input:\n\n1. The first two `2`s (at positions 2 and 3) form a pair, so they become `8 8`.\n2. The next two `2`s (at positions 4 and 5) form another pair, so they become `8 8`.\n3. The next two `2`s (at positions 6 and 7) form another pair, so they become `8 8`.\n4. The single `2` at position 8 remains `2`.\n5. The last three `2`s (at positions 12, 13, and 14) form a pair and a single `2`. The pair becomes `8 8`, and the single `2` remains `2`.\n\n### Predicted Output:\n- **Output:** 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 0 0 0 8 8 2\n\nThus, the output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 0 0 0 8 8 2>>>"
