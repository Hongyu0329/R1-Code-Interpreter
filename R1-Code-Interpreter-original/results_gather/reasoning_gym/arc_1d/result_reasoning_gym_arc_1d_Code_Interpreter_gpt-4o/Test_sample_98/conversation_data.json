    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 4 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 4 4 4\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 1 1 1 1 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 9 0 9 9 9 9 0 9 9 9 9 0 1 1 1 1 0 2 2 2 2 0 2\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0\n\n### Observations:\n1. **Trailing Numbers:** In each example, the trailing numbers (non-zero) in the input are extended in the output. For example, in Example 1, the trailing '4' is extended to three '4's in the output.\n2. **Leading Numbers:** In Example 2, the leading '9' is extended to multiple '9's in the output.\n3. **Middle Numbers:** In Example 3, the middle '1' is extended to multiple '1's in the output.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n- Identify non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n- Extend these numbers in the output grid, maintaining their position relative to other numbers.\n- The number of extensions seems to be related to the position and the number of zeros surrounding them.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 7 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nLet's apply the rule to predict the output:\n\n1. The '7' is a leading number and should be extended.\n2. The '1's are in the middle and should be extended.\n\nLet's construct the output grid based on these observations.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n# Initialize the output grid with zeros\noutput_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\n\n# Apply the rule to extend the non-zero numbers\n# Extend the '7'\noutput_grid[0:5] = [7] * 5\n\n# Extend the '1's\noutput_grid[6:10] = [1] * 4\n\noutput_grid\nassistant > The predicted output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<7 7 7 7 7 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
