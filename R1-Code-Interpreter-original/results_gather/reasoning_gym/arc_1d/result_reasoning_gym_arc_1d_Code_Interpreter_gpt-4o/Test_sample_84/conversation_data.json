    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Observations:\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: 7 0 0 9 9 9 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 7 0 0 9 9 9 0 3 1 1 3 0 3 2 2 3 0 0 0\n   - Observation: The number '3' is inserted after each sequence of non-zero numbers.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 0 3 7 7 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 6 6 3 0\n   - Observation: The number '3' is inserted after each sequence of non-zero numbers.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 9 9 0 0 1 1 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 3 9 9 3 3 1 1 3 0 0\n   - Observation: The number '3' is inserted after each sequence of non-zero numbers.\n\n### Rule:\nThe rule appears to be that after each sequence of non-zero numbers, a '3' is inserted in the output grid. This '3' is inserted immediately after the last non-zero number in each sequence.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 5 5\n- **Applying the Rule:**\n  - After the sequence '6 6 6', insert '3'.\n  - After the single '6', insert '3'.\n  - After the sequence '5 5', insert '3'.\n\nLet's construct the output grid based on this rule.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Test input grid\ntest_input = [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5]\n\n# Initialize the output grid\ntest_output = []\n\n# Apply the rule to generate the output grid\ni = 0\nwhile i < len(test_input):\n    test_output.append(test_input[i])\n    if test_input[i] != 0:\n        # Check if the next element is zero or if it's the end of the list\n        if i + 1 == len(test_input) or test_input[i + 1] == 0:\n            test_output.append(3)\n    i += 1\n\ntest_output\nassistant > The output grid for the test input, following the identified rule, is:\n\n<<<answer>>>\n0 0 0 0 6 6 6 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 3 0 0 0 5 5 3\n<<<answer>>>"
