    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:**  0 6 6 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 6 6 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:**  0 0 0 7 8 9 6 9 9 8 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 7 8 9 6 9 9 8 0 0\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:**  0 0 0 0 0 0 7 2 7 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 2 7 0 0 0\n\n### Observations:\n1. In each example, the sequence of non-zero numbers in the input grid is shifted one position to the right in the output grid.\n2. The first non-zero number in the input grid becomes zero in the output grid.\n3. The rest of the numbers remain in the same order but are shifted one position to the right.\n4. The trailing zeros remain unchanged.\n\n### Rule:\n- Identify the first non-zero number in the input grid.\n- Replace this first non-zero number with zero in the output grid.\n- Shift the sequence of non-zero numbers one position to the right.\n- Keep the trailing zeros unchanged.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 0 4 3 5 4 9 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nFollowing the rule:\n- The first non-zero number is 4 (at index 2).\n- Replace this 4 with 0.\n- Shift the sequence [4, 3, 5, 4, 9] one position to the right.\n- The output grid becomes: 0 0 0 4 3 5 4 9 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThus, the output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 4 3 5 4 9 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
