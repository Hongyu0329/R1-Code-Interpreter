    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n- **Output:** 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5\n\n### Observations:\n1. The output grid seems to be a transformation of the input grid where the sequence of numbers is shifted or modified.\n2. In Example 1, the leading '0' in the input is replaced by '1' in the output, and the trailing '1' is replaced by '0'.\n3. In Example 2, the sequence of '4's is shortened by one at the end, and the trailing '0' is replaced by '4'.\n4. In Example 3, the sequence of '5's is shortened by one at the end, and the trailing '0' is replaced by '5'.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n- The rule seems to involve shifting the sequence of numbers to the left by one position, and the last '0' in the sequence is replaced by the number that was shifted out from the beginning.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n- **Predicted Output:** By applying the rule, the sequence of '4's is shifted left by one position, and the last '0' is replaced by '4'.\n\nLet's compute the output grid for the test input.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Test input grid\ntest_input = [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]\n\n# Apply the rule: shift left by one and replace the last '0' with the shifted out number\nshifted_out = test_input[0]\ntest_output = test_input[1:]  # Shift left by one\ntest_output[-1] = shifted_out  # Replace the last '0' with the shifted out number\n\ntest_output\nassistant > The predicted output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4>>>"
