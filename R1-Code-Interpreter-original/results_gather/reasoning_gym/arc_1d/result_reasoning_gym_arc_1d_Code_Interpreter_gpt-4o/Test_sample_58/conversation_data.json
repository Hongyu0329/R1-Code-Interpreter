    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 8\n- **Output:** 8 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 5 5\n- **Output:** 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 5 5 5 5 5\n\n### Observations:\n1. The input and output grids are sequences of numbers.\n2. The output grid seems to be a rearrangement of the input grid.\n3. The zeros in the input grid are shifted to the left in the output grid.\n4. The non-zero numbers are shifted to the right in the output grid.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n- The rule appears to be that all zeros in the input grid are moved to the leftmost positions in the output grid, while the non-zero numbers maintain their relative order and are shifted to the right.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0\n- According to the rule, all zeros should be moved to the leftmost positions, and the non-zero numbers (6s) should be shifted to the right.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input to predict the output grid.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Test input grid\ntest_input = [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n# Apply the rule: move all zeros to the left and non-zero numbers to the right\nzeros = [x for x in test_input if x == 0]\nnon_zeros = [x for x in test_input if x != 0]\n\n# Combine zeros and non-zeros to form the output grid\ntest_output = zeros + non_zeros\ntest_output\nassistant > The predicted output grid for the test input is:\n\n\\[0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6>>>"
