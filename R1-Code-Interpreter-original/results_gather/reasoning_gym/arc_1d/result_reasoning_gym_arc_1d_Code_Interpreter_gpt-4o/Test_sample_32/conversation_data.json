    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 3 3 3 3 3 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 0\n- **Output:** 2 2 2 2 2 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 3 3 3 3 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0\n- **Output:** 2 2 2 2 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 3 3 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n- **Output:** 0 2 2 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n### Observations:\n1. The output grid seems to be derived from the input grid by transforming the numbers based on their position.\n2. The transformation appears to involve decrementing the numbers in the input grid by 1, but only for certain segments.\n3. The transformation seems to be applied to contiguous segments of '3's, converting them to '2's and '1's, depending on their position in the sequence.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n- The first contiguous segment of '3's in the input is transformed to '2's in the output.\n- The second contiguous segment of '3's in the input is transformed to '1's in the output.\n- Zeros remain unchanged.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 3 3 3 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0\n- The first segment of '3's (3 3 3) becomes (2 2 2).\n- The zero remains unchanged.\n- The second segment of '3's (3 3 3 3 3 3 3) becomes (1 1 1 1 1 1 1).\n- The final zeros remain unchanged.\n\n### Predicted Output:\n- **Output:** 2 2 2 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\n\nThus, the output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<2 2 2 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0>>>"
