    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 5 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 5 0\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 7 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 7\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 6 6 1 3 3 6 9 6 4 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 1 3 3 6 9 6 4 0 0\n\n### Observations:\n1. In each example, the non-zero elements in the input grid are shifted to the right in the output grid.\n2. The number of zeros at the beginning of the output grid increases compared to the input grid.\n3. The non-zero elements maintain their order but are shifted to the right.\n\n### Rule:\n- Identify the first non-zero element in the input grid.\n- Shift all non-zero elements to the right, maintaining their order, until the first non-zero element is at the position where the first zero appears in the input grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 7 2 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- The first non-zero element is `7` at index 0.\n- Shift all non-zero elements to the right, maintaining their order, until the first non-zero element is at the position where the first zero appears in the input grid.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input to find the output.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Test input grid\ntest_input = [7, 2, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n# Find the first zero index in the input grid\nfirst_zero_index = test_input.index(0)\n\n# Extract non-zero elements from the input grid\nnon_zero_elements = [x for x in test_input if x != 0]\n\n# Create the output grid by placing zeros at the beginning and appending non-zero elements\noutput_grid = [0] * first_zero_index + non_zero_elements\n\noutput_grid\nassistant > The output grid for the test input, following the identified rule, is:\n\n\\[0, 0, 0, 7, 2, 7\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 7 2 7>>>"
