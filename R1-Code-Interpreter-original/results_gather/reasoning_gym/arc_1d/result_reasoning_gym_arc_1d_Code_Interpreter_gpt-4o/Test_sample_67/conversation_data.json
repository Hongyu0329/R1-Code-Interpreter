    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations:\n1. In each example, the input grid contains two non-zero numbers, which are the same.\n2. The output grid extends the non-zero numbers to fill the space between them with the same number.\n3. The non-zero numbers in the input grid are replaced by a continuous sequence of the same number in the output grid.\n\n### Rule:\n- Identify the two non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n- Replace the segment between these two numbers (inclusive) with the same non-zero number.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 9\n- The two non-zero numbers are 9, located at positions 17 and 21.\n- Replace the segment from position 17 to 21 with 9.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input grid.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the test input grid\ntest_input = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9]\n\n# Find the positions of the non-zero numbers\nnon_zero_positions = [i for i, x in enumerate(test_input) if x != 0]\n\n# Get the non-zero number\nnon_zero_number = test_input[non_zero_positions[0]]\n\n# Create the output grid by replacing the segment between the non-zero numbers\ntest_output = test_input[:]\nfor i in range(non_zero_positions[0], non_zero_positions[-1] + 1):\n    test_output[i] = non_zero_number\n\ntest_output\nassistant > The output grid for the test input, based on the derived rule, is:\n\n<<<answer>>>\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9\n<<<answer>>>"
