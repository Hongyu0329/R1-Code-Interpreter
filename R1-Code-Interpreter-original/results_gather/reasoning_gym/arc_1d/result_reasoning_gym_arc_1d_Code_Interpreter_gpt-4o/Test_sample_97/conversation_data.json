    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 1 1 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 1 1 0 0 0\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 5 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 8 8 8 8 0 8 8 8\n\n### Observations:\n1. In each example, there is a non-zero number in the input grid that is repeated in the output grid.\n2. The non-zero number in the input grid is repeated in the output grid, replacing some of the zeros.\n3. The position of the non-zero number in the input grid seems to determine where it is repeated in the output grid.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n- Identify the non-zero number in the input grid.\n- Repeat this number in the output grid, replacing zeros, in a pattern that matches the examples.\n- The pattern seems to involve repeating the number in blocks or sequences, possibly influenced by the position of the number in the input grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 0 2 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- The non-zero number in the input grid is `2`.\n- According to the pattern observed, `2` should be repeated in the output grid.\n\nLet's apply this rule to generate the output for the test input.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Test input grid\ntest_input = [0, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n# Applying the rule to generate the output\n# The non-zero number in the input grid is 2\n# Repeat 2 in a pattern similar to the examples\n\n# Initialize the output grid with zeros\ntest_output = [0] * len(test_input)\n\n# Apply the pattern observed in the examples\n# The number 2 appears in the second position, so we will repeat it in a similar pattern\n# Based on the examples, the pattern seems to be repeating the number in blocks\n# Let's assume a similar pattern for the test input\n\n# Repeat 2 in the first few positions\ntest_output[0:3] = [2, 2, 2]\n# Repeat 2 in the middle positions\ntest_output[4:6] = [2, 2]\n# Repeat 2 in the last few positions\ntest_output[7:9] = [2, 2]\n\n# The rest of the numbers remain the same as the input\ntest_output[3] = test_input[3]\ntest_output[5:] = test_input[5:]\n\ntest_output\nassistant > The output grid for the test input, based on the derived rule, is:\n\n<<<2 2 2 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
