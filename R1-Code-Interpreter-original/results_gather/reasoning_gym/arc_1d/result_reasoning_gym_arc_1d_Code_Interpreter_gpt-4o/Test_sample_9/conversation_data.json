    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 7 0 0 7 0 0 7 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations:\n1. The output grid seems to retain the sequence of numbers from the input grid until a certain point, after which it becomes zero.\n2. The transition to zeros in the output grid seems to occur after the first occurrence of a zero in the input grid, following a sequence of non-zero numbers.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n- Traverse the input grid from left to right.\n- Copy the numbers from the input grid to the output grid until you encounter a zero that follows a sequence of non-zero numbers.\n- Once a zero is encountered after a sequence of non-zero numbers, replace all subsequent numbers with zero in the output grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 5 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0\n\nLet's apply the rule to this input grid to predict the output grid.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the function to apply the derived rule\ndef apply_rule(input_grid):\n    output_grid = []\n    zero_encountered = False\n    \n    for num in input_grid:\n        if zero_encountered:\n            output_grid.append(0)\n        else:\n            output_grid.append(num)\n            if num == 0:\n                zero_encountered = True\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input grid\ntest_input = [0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n# Apply the rule to the test input\ntest_output = apply_rule(test_input)\ntest_output\nassistant > The predicted output grid for the test input, based on the derived rule, is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
