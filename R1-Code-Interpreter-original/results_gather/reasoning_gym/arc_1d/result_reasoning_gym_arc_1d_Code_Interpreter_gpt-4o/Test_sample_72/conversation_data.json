    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations:\n1. The output grid seems to be a rearrangement of the input grid.\n2. The non-zero elements in the input grid are shifted to the right in the output grid.\n3. The number of zeros at the beginning of the output grid is three, except in Example 3 where the non-zero element is already near the start.\n4. The non-zero elements are shifted to the right by three positions, except when they are already near the start.\n\n### Rule:\n- Shift all non-zero elements in the input grid three positions to the right.\n- If the non-zero elements are already near the start, they are shifted to the rightmost possible position without exceeding the grid length.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- Shift the non-zero elements (2, 2, 2) three positions to the right.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input grid.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the test input grid\ntest_input = [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n# Initialize the output grid with zeros\ntest_output = [0] * len(test_input)\n\n# Find the non-zero elements and their positions\nnon_zero_elements = [x for x in test_input if x != 0]\n\n# Determine the starting position for the non-zero elements in the output grid\nstart_position = 3\n\n# Place the non-zero elements in the output grid, shifted by three positions\nfor i, element in enumerate(non_zero_elements):\n    test_output[start_position + i] = element\n\ntest_output\nassistant > The output grid for the test input, after applying the identified rule, is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
