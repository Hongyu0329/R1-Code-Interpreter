    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 2 0 2 0 0 0 2 2 0 2 1\n- **Output:** 2 2 2 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 2 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 2 1\n- **Output:** 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 1 2 0 2 1 0 2 0\n- **Output:** 2 2 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations:\n1. The output grid always starts with a sequence of '2's, followed by '1's, and ends with '0's.\n2. The number of '2's in the output seems to be the count of '2's in the input.\n3. The number of '1's in the output seems to be the count of '1's in the input.\n4. The remaining positions in the output are filled with '0's.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n- Count the number of '2's in the input grid. This count determines the number of '2's at the start of the output grid.\n- Count the number of '1's in the input grid. This count determines the number of '1's following the '2's in the output grid.\n- Fill the remaining positions in the output grid with '0's.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 0 0\n  - Count of '2's: 4\n  - Count of '1's: 0\n  - Remaining positions: 7 (total length 11 - 4 '2's - 0 '1's)\n\n### Test Output:\n- Start with 4 '2's: 2 2 2 2\n- Follow with 0 '1's: (none)\n- Fill remaining 7 positions with '0's: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThus, the output for the test input is:\n\n<<<2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
