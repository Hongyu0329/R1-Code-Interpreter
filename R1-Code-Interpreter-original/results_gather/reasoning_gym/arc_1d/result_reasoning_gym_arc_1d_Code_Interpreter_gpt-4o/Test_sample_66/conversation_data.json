    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe input and output are identical.\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 0 0 0 0\n\nThe input and output are identical.\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n- **Output:** 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0\n\nIn this example, the sequence of 8s is shifted to the left, and the trailing 8s are replaced with 0s.\n\n### Observations:\n- In Examples 1 and 2, the input and output grids are identical.\n- In Example 3, the sequence of 8s is shifted to the left, and the trailing 8s are replaced with 0s.\n\n### Hypothesis:\nThe rule seems to be that if there is a sequence of identical numbers (other than 0) in the input grid, it should be shifted to the leftmost position where it can fit, and the trailing numbers are replaced with 0s. If the sequence is already at the leftmost position, the input and output grids remain the same.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0\n\nLet's apply the rule to this input grid.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Test input grid\ntest_input = [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n\n# Find the first non-zero sequence\ndef find_non_zero_sequence(grid):\n    start = None\n    end = None\n    for i, value in enumerate(grid):\n        if value != 0:\n            if start is None:\n                start = i\n            end = i\n    return start, end\n\n# Apply the rule\ndef apply_rule(grid):\n    start, end = find_non_zero_sequence(grid)\n    if start is not None and end is not None:\n        # Extract the sequence\n        sequence = grid[start:end+1]\n        # Create the new grid\n        new_grid = [0] * len(grid)\n        # Place the sequence at the leftmost position\n        new_grid[:len(sequence)] = sequence\n        return new_grid\n    return grid\n\n# Apply the rule to the test input\ntest_output = apply_rule(test_input)\ntest_output\nassistant > The output grid for the test input, after applying the identified rule, is:\n\n<<<answer>>>\n2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0\n<<<answer>>>"
