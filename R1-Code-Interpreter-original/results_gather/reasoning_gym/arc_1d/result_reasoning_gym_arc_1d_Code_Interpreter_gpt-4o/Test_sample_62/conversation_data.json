    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 8 8 0 0 1 1 0 0 8 8 0 0 7 0 0\n- **Output:** 8 8 3 3 1 1 3 3 8 8 3 0 7 0 0\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 6 6 0 0\n- **Output:** 1 0 0 0 0 3 1 1 3 0 3 6 6 3 0\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 5 5 0 0 2 2 0 0 6 0 0 0 1 1 0\n- **Output:** 5 5 3 3 2 2 3 0 6 0 0 3 1 1 3\n\n### Observations:\n1. The number `3` is inserted in the output grid at specific positions.\n2. The `3` appears to be inserted after every sequence of non-zero numbers, except when the sequence is at the end of the grid.\n3. The `3` is not inserted if the sequence is followed by a zero or if the sequence is at the end of the grid.\n\n### Rule:\n- For each sequence of non-zero numbers in the input grid, insert a `3` immediately after the sequence, unless the sequence is at the end of the grid or followed by a zero.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 4 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 9 9 9 0 0 0 0\n\nLet's apply the rule to this input:\n\n1. The first sequence is `4`, followed by `0`. No `3` is inserted.\n2. The next sequence is `5 5`, followed by `0`. No `3` is inserted.\n3. The next sequence is `9 9 9`, followed by `0`. No `3` is inserted.\n\nThus, the output grid remains the same as the input grid because each sequence is followed by a zero.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<<<4 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 9 9 9 0 0 0 0>>>"
