    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 1 0 2 0 0 1 2 1\n- **Output:** 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 1 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 1 2 2 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0\n- **Output:** 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1\n\n### Observations:\n1. The first two elements of the output are always `2 2`.\n2. The rest of the output seems to be a transformation of the input, where:\n   - The sequence of `1`s in the input is shifted towards the end of the output.\n   - The sequence of `2`s in the input is replaced by `0`s in the output.\n   - The `0`s in the input remain `0`s in the output, except for the first two positions which are `2 2`.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n- The first two elements of the output are always `2 2`.\n- Replace all `2`s in the input with `0`s.\n- Shift all `1`s in the input to the end of the output, maintaining their order.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 0 1 2 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 2\n- **Step 1:** Start with `2 2`.\n- **Step 2:** Replace `2`s with `0`s: 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0\n- **Step 3:** Shift all `1`s to the end: 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1\n\nThus, the output for the test input is:\n\n<<<2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1>>>"
