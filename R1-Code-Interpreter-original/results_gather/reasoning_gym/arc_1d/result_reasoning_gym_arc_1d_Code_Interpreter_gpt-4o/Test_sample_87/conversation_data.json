    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:**  0 0 0 0 0 2 0 1 2 1 2 0 0 2 2\n- **Output:** 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:**  2 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 2 1 0\n- **Output:** 2 2 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:**  0 1 1 2 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 1\n- **Output:** 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations:\n1. The output grid always starts with a sequence of '2's, followed by '1's, and then '0's.\n2. The number of '2's in the output seems to be equal to the number of '2's in the input.\n3. The number of '1's in the output seems to be equal to the number of '1's in the input.\n4. The rest of the output is filled with '0's.\n\n### Rule:\n- Count the number of '2's in the input grid. This count determines the number of '2's at the start of the output grid.\n- Count the number of '1's in the input grid. This count determines the number of '1's following the '2's in the output grid.\n- Fill the remaining positions in the output grid with '0's.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n### Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 1 0 0 2 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 2 0\n\n### Applying the Rule:\n1. Count of '2's in the input: 2\n2. Count of '1's in the input: 4\n3. The output grid will start with two '2's, followed by four '1's, and the rest will be '0's.\n\n### Predicted Output:\n- **Output:** 2 2 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2 2 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
