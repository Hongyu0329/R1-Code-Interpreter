    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 6 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 3 3 3 0 3 3 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 3 0 3 3 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations:\n1. The first element of the input grid is always retained in the output grid.\n2. The second element of the input grid is set to 0 in the output grid.\n3. The third element of the input grid is retained in the output grid.\n4. The fourth element of the input grid is retained in the output grid.\n5. The fifth element of the input grid is set to 0 in the output grid.\n6. The sixth element of the input grid is retained in the output grid.\n7. The seventh element of the input grid is retained in the output grid.\n8. The eighth element of the input grid is retained in the output grid.\n9. The remaining elements (9th to 13th) are all 0 in both input and output grids.\n\n### Rule:\n- The output grid is derived from the input grid by setting the second and fifth elements to 0, while retaining the other elements.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 9 0 9 9 9 0 9 9 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Test Output:** 9 0 9 9 0 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input grid to predict the output grid.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the test input grid\ntest_input = [9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n# Apply the rule to generate the output grid\ntest_output = test_input.copy()\ntest_output[1] = 0  # Set the second element to 0\ntest_output[4] = 0  # Set the fifth element to 0\n\ntest_output\nassistant > The predicted output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<9 0 9 9 0 0 9 9 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
