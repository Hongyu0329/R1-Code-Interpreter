    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 6 6 6 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 9\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations:\n1. In each example, the number `2` remains in the same position in both the input and output grids.\n2. The sequence of numbers (e.g., `6 6 6`, `4 4`, `9`) is shifted to the left in the output grid.\n3. The sequence of numbers is moved to the first available position from the left, starting from the 5th position in the output grid.\n\n### Rule:\n- Identify the position of the number `2` in the input grid.\n- Keep the number `2` in the same position in the output grid.\n- Move any sequence of numbers (other than `2`) to the leftmost available position, starting from the 5th position in the output grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 2 0 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- The number `2` is at position 5.\n- The sequence `7 7 7` should be moved to the leftmost available position starting from the 5th position.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input to determine the output.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n# Initialize the output grid with zeros\noutput_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\n\n# Find the position of the number 2\nposition_of_2 = input_grid.index(2)\n\n# Place the number 2 in the same position in the output grid\noutput_grid[position_of_2] = 2\n\n# Find the sequence of numbers to move (other than 2)\nsequence_start = 0\nsequence_end = 0\nfor i in range(len(input_grid)):\n    if input_grid[i] != 0 and input_grid[i] != 2:\n        if sequence_start == 0:\n            sequence_start = i\n        sequence_end = i\n\n# Move the sequence to the leftmost available position starting from the 5th position\noutput_position = 5\nfor i in range(sequence_start, sequence_end + 1):\n    output_grid[output_position] = input_grid[i]\n    output_position += 1\n\noutput_grid\nassistant > The output grid for the test input, following the identified rule, is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 2 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
