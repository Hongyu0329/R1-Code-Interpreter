    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 3 7 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 3 7 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe non-zero sequence \"9 3 7\" is shifted to the leftmost position where zeros were present.\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 6 6 9 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 1 8\n- **Output:** 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 1 8 6 6 9\n\nThe non-zero sequence \"2\" is shifted to the leftmost position where zeros were present, and the remaining sequence \"3 1 8 6 6 9\" is shifted to the right.\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 7 7 7 7 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe non-zero sequence \"7 7 7 7 3 2\" is shifted to the leftmost position where zeros were present.\n\n### Observations:\n1. Identify the longest contiguous sequence of non-zero numbers.\n2. Shift this sequence to the leftmost position where zeros were present.\n3. The remaining numbers are shifted to the right.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0\n\nFollowing the rule:\n- The non-zero sequence is \"7\".\n- Shift \"7\" to the leftmost position where zeros were present.\n\nThus, the output grid should be:\n\n<<<7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
