    "\nassistant > To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 7 7 7 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 1 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 1 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 1 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 1 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n- **Output:** 1 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0\n\n### Observations:\n1. The first element of the input is always retained in the output.\n2. The sequence of non-zero numbers following the first element is retained in the output.\n3. The first zero after a sequence of non-zero numbers is replaced by the last non-zero number in that sequence.\n4. The rest of the elements remain unchanged.\n\n### Rule:\n- Retain the first element.\n- Identify the first sequence of non-zero numbers after the first element.\n- Replace the first zero after this sequence with the last number of the sequence.\n- Keep the rest of the elements unchanged.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 1 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- The first element is `1`.\n- The first sequence of non-zero numbers after the first element is `9`.\n- Replace the first zero after `9` with `9`.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input to get the output.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [1, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n# Applying the rule\noutput_grid = input_grid.copy()\n\n# Retain the first element\noutput_grid[0] = input_grid[0]\n\n# Find the first sequence of non-zero numbers after the first element\nfor i in range(1, len(input_grid)):\n    if input_grid[i] != 0:\n        last_non_zero = input_grid[i]\n    elif input_grid[i] == 0 and 'last_non_zero' in locals():\n        # Replace the first zero after the sequence with the last non-zero number\n        output_grid[i] = last_non_zero\n        break\n\noutput_grid\nassistant > The output grid for the test input, after applying the derived rule, is:\n\n<<<1 0 0 0 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
