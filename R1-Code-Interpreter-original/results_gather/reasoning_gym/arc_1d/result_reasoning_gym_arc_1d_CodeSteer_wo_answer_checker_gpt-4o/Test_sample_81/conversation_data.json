    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of 1s is shifted to the right by 5 positions.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of 6s is shifted to the right by 8 positions.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of 1s is shifted to the right by 5 positions.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can deduce that the non-zero sequence in the input grid is shifted to the right by a certain number of positions. The number of positions seems to be determined by the length of the leading zeros before the non-zero sequence in the input grid.\n\n### Test Input Analysis\n\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Leading Zeros:** 9 zeros before the sequence of 3s.\n- **Expected Shift:** Based on the pattern, the sequence of 3s should be shifted to the right by 9 positions.\n\n### Test Output\n\nBy applying the derived rule, the sequence of 3s will be shifted to the right by 9 positions. The output grid will be:\n\n```python\noutput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>",
    "To enhance the solution with a more dynamic approach, we can implement a function that analyzes the input grid to determine the shift amount based on the pattern of non-zero elements. This function will dynamically calculate the shift by identifying the first occurrence of a non-zero sequence and then determining how far it should be shifted to match the output pattern observed in the examples.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan for the improved solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Non-Zero Sequence:**\n   - Traverse the input grid to find the first and last indices of the non-zero sequence.\n\n2. **Calculate the Shift Amount:**\n   - Determine the number of leading zeros before the non-zero sequence.\n   - Calculate the shift amount based on the pattern observed in the examples.\n\n3. **Construct the Output Grid:**\n   - Create a new grid initialized with zeros.\n   - Place the non-zero sequence in the new grid, shifted by the calculated amount.\n\n4. **Output the Result:**\n   - Print the output grid in the specified format.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Step 1: Identify the non-zero sequence\n    first_non_zero = None\n    last_non_zero = None\n    for i, value in enumerate(input_grid):\n        if value != 0:\n            if first_non_zero is None:\n                first_non_zero = i\n            last_non_zero = i\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the shift amount\n    leading_zeros = first_non_zero\n    non_zero_length = last_non_zero - first_non_zero + 1\n    shift_amount = leading_zeros  # Based on the pattern observed\n\n    # Step 3: Construct the output grid\n    output_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\n    for i in range(non_zero_length):\n        output_grid[shift_amount + i] = input_grid[first_non_zero + i]\n\n    # Step 4: Output the result\n    print(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\ntransform_grid(input_grid)\n```\n\nThis code dynamically determines the shift amount by analyzing the input grid and applies the transformation accordingly. The function `transform_grid` encapsulates the logic for identifying the non-zero sequence, calculating the shift, and constructing the output grid."

    "The current solution correctly identifies the pattern and applies it to the test input. However, the code is relatively simple and lacks symbolic computing or efficient searching techniques. To improve the solution, consider implementing a more complex algorithm that can dynamically determine the shift amount based on the input pattern, potentially using symbolic computing or more advanced data structures. This could involve analyzing the input grid to identify patterns and shifts more efficiently."
