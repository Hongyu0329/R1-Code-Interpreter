    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n   - **Output:** 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of 4s in the input is shifted to the left by 2 positions, and the trailing 4s are replaced by 0s.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1\n   - **Output:** 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of 1s at the beginning is shifted to the right by 2 positions, and the trailing 0s are replaced by 1s.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3\n   - **Output:** 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of 3s at the beginning is shifted to the right by 2 positions, and the trailing 0s are replaced by 3s.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can derive the following rule:\n- Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers at the beginning of the input grid.\n- Shift this sequence to the right by 2 positions.\n- Replace the trailing numbers with the identified non-zero number.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\n**Test Input:**\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers: `2`.\n2. Shift this sequence to the right by 2 positions.\n3. Replace the trailing numbers with `2`.\n\n**Output:**\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2\n\nThus, the final output grid is:\n\n```python\nprint(\"<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2>>>\")\n```",
    "To address the problem with a more sophisticated approach, we can use symbolic computing to dynamically identify patterns and transformations in the input grid. One way to achieve this is by using Python's `sympy` library, which is designed for symbolic mathematics. However, since the problem is more about pattern recognition and transformation, we can simulate a symbolic approach by analyzing the input grid and applying transformations based on identified patterns.\n\n### Plan\n\n1. **Identify Patterns:**\n   - Use symbolic representation to identify sequences of non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n   - Determine the length and position of these sequences.\n\n2. **Transform the Grid:**\n   - Apply a transformation rule based on the identified patterns.\n   - Shift the identified sequence to the right by 2 positions.\n   - Replace trailing numbers with the identified non-zero number.\n\n3. **Implement the Solution:**\n   - Use Python to implement the above logic, ensuring the solution is adaptable to various input scenarios.\n\nHere's how you can implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Convert the input grid to a list of integers\n    grid = list(map(int, input_grid.split()))\n    \n    # Identify the first non-zero sequence\n    non_zero_value = None\n    start_index = None\n    for i, value in enumerate(grid):\n        if value != 0:\n            non_zero_value = value\n            start_index = i\n            break\n    \n    # If no non-zero value is found, return the grid as is\n    if non_zero_value is None:\n        return grid\n    \n    # Determine the length of the non-zero sequence\n    length = 0\n    for i in range(start_index, len(grid)):\n        if grid[i] == non_zero_value:\n            length += 1\n        else:\n            break\n    \n    # Create the output grid\n    output_grid = [0] * len(grid)\n    \n    # Place the non-zero sequence shifted by 2 positions\n    for i in range(length):\n        if start_index + i + 2 < len(grid):\n            output_grid[start_index + i + 2] = non_zero_value\n    \n    # Fill the trailing positions with the non-zero value\n    for i in range(len(grid) - length, len(grid)):\n        output_grid[i] = non_zero_value\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code dynamically identifies the non-zero sequence in the input grid, shifts it by 2 positions, and fills the trailing positions with the identified non-zero value. The use of symbolic-like analysis allows the solution to adapt to various input scenarios."

    "The current solution seems to be based on a simple observation and transformation rule. However, the complexity analysis indicates that the code lacks symbolic computing or efficient searching. To improve the solution, consider implementing a more sophisticated approach that can dynamically identify patterns and transformations in the input grid. This could involve using algorithms that can handle symbolic manipulation or pattern recognition to ensure the solution is robust and adaptable to various input scenarios. Try to solve this question with more complex and delicate code, possibly incorporating symbolic computing techniques."
