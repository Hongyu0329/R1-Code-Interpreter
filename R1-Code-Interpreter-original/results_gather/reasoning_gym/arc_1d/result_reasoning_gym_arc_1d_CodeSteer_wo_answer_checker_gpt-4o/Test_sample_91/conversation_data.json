    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 5 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 5 0\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 7 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 7\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 6 6 1 3 3 6 9 6 4 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 1 3 3 6 9 6 4 0 0\n\n**Observations:**\n- In each example, the output grid is a shifted version of the input grid.\n- The non-zero elements in the input grid are shifted to the right, and zeros are filled in from the left.\n- The number of positions shifted seems to be determined by the position of the first non-zero element in the input grid.\n\n**Rule Derivation:**\n- Identify the first non-zero element in the input grid.\n- Shift all elements to the right by the index of this first non-zero element.\n- Fill the left side with zeros to maintain the grid size.\n\n**Test Input:**\n- Input: 7 2 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Applying the Rule:**\n- The first non-zero element is at index 0 (value 7).\n- Shift all elements to the right by 0 positions (no shift needed).\n- The output grid remains the same as the input grid.\n\nTherefore, the output for the test input is:\n\n<<<answer>>> 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 2 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 <<<answer>>>",
    "It seems like you're asking for guidance on how to approach a problem or task. Here's a general approach to problem-solving, especially when dealing with tasks that require coding or logical reasoning:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - Carefully read the problem statement.\n   - Identify the inputs and expected outputs.\n   - Look for any patterns or rules in the examples provided.\n\n2. **Break Down the Problem:**\n   - Divide the problem into smaller, manageable parts.\n   - Consider each part separately and how they relate to each other.\n\n3. **Identify Patterns or Rules:**\n   - Analyze any examples given to identify patterns or rules.\n   - Consider edge cases or exceptions to these patterns.\n\n4. **Plan a Solution:**\n   - Outline a step-by-step plan to solve the problem.\n   - Consider different approaches and choose the most efficient one.\n\n5. **Implement the Solution:**\n   - Write the code or script based on your plan.\n   - Use comments to explain complex parts of your code.\n\n6. **Test the Solution:**\n   - Test your solution with different inputs, including edge cases.\n   - Ensure the output matches the expected results.\n\n7. **Refine and Optimize:**\n   - Review your code for any inefficiencies or improvements.\n   - Optimize the code for better performance if necessary.\n\n8. **Document the Solution:**\n   - Write clear documentation or comments explaining your solution.\n   - Ensure others can understand your approach and reasoning.\n\nIf you have a specific problem or task you need help with, feel free to provide more details, and I can guide you through the process or provide a code solution."
