    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n### Analysis of Examples\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 1 0 1 1 2 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 2 0 1 0 2 2 0\n   - **Output:** 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 2\n   - **Output:** 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 1 0 2 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 2 0 1 1 1 2 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2\n\n### Observations\n\n- The output grid always starts with a sequence of `1`s, followed by `0`s, and ends with `2`s.\n- The number of `1`s in the output seems to be the count of `1`s in the input.\n- The number of `2`s in the output seems to be the count of `2`s in the input.\n- The `0`s fill the remaining positions in the output grid.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\n1. Count the number of `1`s in the input grid.\n2. Count the number of `2`s in the input grid.\n3. The output grid will have:\n   - A sequence of `1`s equal to the count of `1`s in the input.\n   - Followed by `0`s to fill the remaining positions.\n   - Ending with a sequence of `2`s equal to the count of `2`s in the input.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\n- **Test Input:** 1 0 0 1 2 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 0 2 0 0 2 0\n- Count of `1`s: 4\n- Count of `2`s: 3\n- Total length of the grid: 19\n\nThe output grid will be:\n- 4 `1`s\n- 19 - 4 - 3 = 12 `0`s\n- 3 `2`s\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```python\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n\n# Count the number of 1s and 2s\ncount_1 = input_grid.count(1)\ncount_2 = input_grid.count(2)\n\n# Calculate the number of 0s\ncount_0 = len(input_grid) - count_1 - count_2\n\n# Construct the output grid\noutput_grid = [1] * count_1 + [0] * count_0 + [2] * count_2\n\n# Print the output grid\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the final output grid for the test input."
