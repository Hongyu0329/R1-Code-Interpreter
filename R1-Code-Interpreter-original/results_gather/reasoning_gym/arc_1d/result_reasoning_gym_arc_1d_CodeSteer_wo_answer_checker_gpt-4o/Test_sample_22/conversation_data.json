    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n   - **Output:** 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n   - **Output:** 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n   - **Output:** 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n\n**Observations:**\n- The output grid seems to be a rearrangement of the input grid.\n- The first few elements of the output grid are filled with the non-zero numbers from the input grid, followed by zeros, and then the remaining non-zero numbers.\n- The number of leading non-zero numbers in the output grid is equal to the number of non-zero numbers in the first segment of the input grid.\n\n**Rule Derivation:**\n1. Count the number of leading non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n2. Place these numbers at the beginning of the output grid.\n3. Fill the next segment with zeros.\n4. Place the remaining non-zero numbers at the end of the output grid.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- **Test Input:** 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4\n- **Leading non-zero numbers:** 4 4 4 4 4 4\n- **Remaining non-zero numbers:** 4\n\n**Output:**\n- Start with the leading non-zero numbers: 4 4 4 4 4 4\n- Fill with zeros: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- End with the remaining non-zero numbers: 4\n\nCombining these, the output grid is:\n\n<<<answer>>> 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 <<<answer>>>"
