    "To solve this problem, we need to identify a pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0\n   - Observation: The sequence of 4s is shifted two positions to the left.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: 6 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n   - Output: 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n   - Observation: The sequence of 6s is shifted one position to the left.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8\n   - Output: 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8\n   - Observation: The sequence of 8s is shifted two positions to the left.\n\nFrom these observations, we can deduce that the rule involves shifting the sequence of non-zero numbers to the left, filling the vacated positions with zeros. The number of positions to shift seems to depend on the position of the first zero in the sequence.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n- **Test Input:**\n  - Input: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n  - The first zero appears at the 8th position.\n  - Shift the sequence of 2s two positions to the left.\n\nApplying this rule, the output grid will be:\n\n- **Output:**\n  - 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2>>>"
