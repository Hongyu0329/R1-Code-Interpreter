    "To solve this problem, we need to identify a pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n- **Output:** 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5\n- **Output:** 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\n- **Output:** 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations:\n1. The output grid seems to be a rearrangement of the input grid.\n2. The first few elements of the output are filled with the non-zero numbers from the input, followed by zeros, and then the remaining non-zero numbers.\n3. The number of leading non-zero numbers in the output seems to be equal to the number of trailing non-zero numbers in the input.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n- Count the number of trailing non-zero numbers in the input.\n- Place these numbers at the beginning of the output.\n- Fill the middle of the output with zeros.\n- Place the remaining non-zero numbers at the end of the output.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n- Count trailing non-zero numbers: 9 (all 2s at the end).\n- Place these 9 numbers at the beginning of the output.\n- Fill the middle with zeros.\n- Place the remaining non-zero numbers (4 twos) at the end.\n\n### Final Output:\n```python\noutput = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the final output grid.",
    "To enhance the solution with a more sophisticated approach, we can consider using pattern recognition techniques to dynamically identify transformation rules. One way to achieve this is by analyzing the input grid to detect patterns and then applying transformations based on these patterns.\n\n### Plan:\n1. **Identify Segments:** Break the input grid into segments of consecutive identical numbers and zeros.\n2. **Analyze Patterns:** Determine the pattern of non-zero segments and their positions.\n3. **Transform the Grid:** Rearrange the segments based on the identified pattern to form the output grid.\n\n### Steps:\n- **Step 1:** Parse the input grid to identify segments of consecutive identical numbers and zeros.\n- **Step 2:** Analyze the positions and lengths of these segments.\n- **Step 3:** Rearrange the segments to form the output grid based on the observed pattern.\n\n### Implementation:\nWe'll implement a Python function that performs these steps and outputs the transformed grid.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Step 1: Identify segments\n    segments = []\n    current_segment = [input_grid[0]]\n    \n    for num in input_grid[1:]:\n        if num == current_segment[-1]:\n            current_segment.append(num)\n        else:\n            segments.append(current_segment)\n            current_segment = [num]\n    segments.append(current_segment)\n    \n    # Step 2: Analyze patterns\n    non_zero_segments = [seg for seg in segments if seg[0] != 0]\n    zero_segments = [seg for seg in segments if seg[0] == 0]\n    \n    # Step 3: Transform the grid\n    # Place the longest non-zero segment at the start\n    longest_non_zero_segment = max(non_zero_segments, key=len)\n    remaining_non_zero_segments = [seg for seg in non_zero_segments if seg != longest_non_zero_segment]\n    \n    # Construct the output grid\n    output_grid = longest_non_zero_segment + [0] * sum(len(seg) for seg in zero_segments) + sum(remaining_non_zero_segments, [])\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code dynamically identifies segments of numbers and zeros, analyzes their patterns, and rearranges them to form the output grid. The approach is more robust and adaptable to various input configurations, as it doesn't rely on hardcoded rules but instead derives the transformation based on the input structure."

    "The current solution seems to rely on a simple rearrangement of elements based on observed patterns. However, the complexity analysis indicates that the code lacks symbolic computing or efficient searching. To improve the solution, consider implementing a more sophisticated algorithm that can dynamically identify and apply transformation rules. This could involve pattern recognition techniques or symbolic manipulation to ensure the solution is robust and adaptable to various input configurations. Aim to enhance the code with these elements to achieve a more comprehensive solution."
