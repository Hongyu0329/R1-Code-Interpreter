    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0\n\n   Observation: The sequence of 6s is shifted one position to the left, and a 0 is appended at the end.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\n   - Output: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0\n\n   Observation: The sequence of 1s is shifted one position to the left, and a 0 is appended at the end.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n   Observation: The sequence of 3s is shifted one position to the left, and a 0 is appended at the end.\n\n**Rule Derivation:**\nFrom the examples, we can deduce that the rule involves shifting the non-zero sequence one position to the left and appending a 0 at the end. The leading zeros are preserved, and the trailing zeros are adjusted accordingly.\n\n**Test Input:**\n- Input: 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Applying the Rule:**\n- Shift the sequence of 1s one position to the left.\n- Append a 0 at the end.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the output:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero element\n    first_non_zero = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), None)\n    if first_non_zero is None:\n        return input_grid  # If all are zeros, return as is\n\n    # Find the last non-zero element\n    last_non_zero = len(input_grid) - 1 - next((i for i, x in enumerate(reversed(input_grid)) if x != 0), None)\n\n    # Shift the non-zero sequence to the left by one position\n    output_grid = input_grid[:first_non_zero] + input_grid[first_non_zero+1:last_non_zero+1] + [0] + input_grid[last_non_zero+1:]\n\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output in the required format\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the transformed grid according to the derived rule."
