    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1 and Example 2:**\n   - Input: `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0`\n   - Output: `0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`\n   - Observation: The sequence `2 2 2` in the input is shifted to the left by 4 positions in the output.\n\n2. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: `0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0`\n   - Output: `0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`\n   - Observation: The sequence `8 8 8 8 8 8` in the input is shifted to the left by 4 positions in the output.\n\nFrom these observations, we can deduce the rule:\n- Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n- Shift this sequence to the left by 4 positions in the output grid.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- **Test Input:**\n  - `0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0`\n  - The sequence of non-zero numbers is `7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7`.\n  - Shift this sequence to the left by 4 positions.\n\n- **Test Output:**\n  - `0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0`\n\nThus, the final output grid is:\n\n```python\noutput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will print the output grid in the required format.",
    "To create a more generalized and robust solution, we need to dynamically identify the sequence of non-zero numbers and calculate the shift based on the input characteristics. Here's a step-by-step plan to achieve this:\n\n1. **Identify the Non-Zero Sequence:**\n   - Traverse the input grid to find the start and end indices of the first contiguous sequence of non-zero numbers.\n\n2. **Calculate the Shift:**\n   - Determine the number of leading zeros before the non-zero sequence starts.\n   - The shift will be equal to the number of leading zeros.\n\n3. **Construct the Output Grid:**\n   - Create a new grid of the same size as the input.\n   - Place the identified non-zero sequence starting from the position calculated by the shift.\n   - Fill the rest of the grid with zeros.\n\n4. **Handle Edge Cases:**\n   - If there are no non-zero numbers, the output should be the same as the input.\n   - If the sequence is already at the start, no shift is needed.\n\nHere's the Python code implementing this approach:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Step 1: Identify the non-zero sequence\n    start_index = None\n    end_index = None\n    for i, num in enumerate(input_grid):\n        if num != 0:\n            if start_index is None:\n                start_index = i\n            end_index = i\n\n    # If no non-zero sequence is found, return the input as is\n    if start_index is None:\n        return input_grid\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the shift\n    shift = start_index\n\n    # Step 3: Construct the output grid\n    output_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\n    sequence_length = end_index - start_index + 1\n    output_grid[shift:shift + sequence_length] = input_grid[start_index:end_index + 1]\n\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will dynamically identify the non-zero sequence, calculate the necessary shift, and construct the output grid accordingly. It is adaptable to various input sizes and patterns, making it more robust and scalable."

    "The current solution correctly identifies the rule and applies it to the test input. However, to enhance the code's complexity and robustness, consider implementing a more generalized approach that can handle various input sizes and patterns. This could involve dynamically identifying the sequence of non-zero numbers and calculating the shift based on input characteristics. Try to incorporate symbolic computing or efficient searching techniques to make the solution more adaptable and scalable."
