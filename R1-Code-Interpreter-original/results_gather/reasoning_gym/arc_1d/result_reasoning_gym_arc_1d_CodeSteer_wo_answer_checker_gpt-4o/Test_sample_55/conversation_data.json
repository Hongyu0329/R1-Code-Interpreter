    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 0\n\n   Observation: The sequence of four '6's in the input is shifted to the right by four positions in the output.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0\n   - Output: 6 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n\n   Observation: The sequence of '6's is shifted to the left, and the first '6' is moved to the start of the output.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0\n\n   Observation: The single '7' is shifted to the right by four positions.\n\n**Rule Derivation:**\n- It seems that the rule involves shifting non-zero numbers to the right by four positions, except when the sequence of numbers is at the start, in which case the first number is moved to the start of the output.\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n- Input: 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9\n\nApplying the rule:\n- The sequence '9 9' at the start should be moved to the start of the output.\n- The last '9' should be shifted to the right by four positions.\n\nThus, the output should be:\n- 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nNow, let's output the final answer:\n\n```python\n# Output the final answer\noutput_grid = [9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```",
    "To create a more dynamic and generalized solution, we can implement an algorithm that identifies patterns or sequences in the input grid and applies transformations based on these patterns. This approach will involve:\n\n1. **Pattern Detection:** Identify sequences of non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n2. **Transformation Logic:** Apply a transformation rule to these sequences based on their position and length.\n3. **Output Construction:** Construct the output grid by applying the identified transformations.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Non-Zero Sequences:** Traverse the input grid to find contiguous sequences of non-zero numbers.\n\n2. **Apply Transformation Rules:**\n   - If a sequence is at the start of the grid, move it to the start of the output.\n   - Otherwise, shift the sequence to the right by four positions.\n\n3. **Construct the Output Grid:** Initialize an output grid with zeros and place the transformed sequences in their new positions.\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    n = len(input_grid)\n    output_grid = [0] * n\n    i = 0\n\n    while i < n:\n        if input_grid[i] != 0:\n            # Start of a non-zero sequence\n            start = i\n            while i < n and input_grid[i] != 0:\n                i += 1\n            end = i\n\n            # Extract the sequence\n            sequence = input_grid[start:end]\n\n            # Determine the new position\n            if start == 0:\n                # If the sequence starts at the beginning, move it to the start of the output\n                output_grid[:len(sequence)] = sequence\n            else:\n                # Otherwise, shift the sequence to the right by four positions\n                new_start = min(start + 4, n - len(sequence))\n                output_grid[new_start:new_start + len(sequence)] = sequence\n        else:\n            i += 1\n\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code dynamically identifies sequences of non-zero numbers and applies the transformation rules to generate the output grid. The solution is more flexible and can handle different input configurations by detecting and transforming sequences based on their positions."

    "The current solution seems to rely on simple pattern recognition and direct output generation without leveraging symbolic computing or efficient searching. To improve the solution, consider implementing a more complex algorithm that can dynamically identify and apply transformation rules based on the input grid. This could involve parsing the grid to detect patterns or sequences and then applying transformations using symbolic logic or more advanced data structures. Aim to create a solution that can generalize better to different input configurations."
