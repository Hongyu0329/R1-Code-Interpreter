    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 5 5 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 5 5\n   - **Output:** 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 5\n   - **Transformation:** The '0' in the input is shifted one position to the right in the output.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0\n   - **Transformation:** The '0' at the start of the input is shifted one position to the right in the output.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0\n   - **Transformation:** The '0' at the start of the input is shifted one position to the right in the output.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- Identify the first occurrence of '0' in the input grid.\n- Shift this '0' one position to the right in the output grid.\n- All other elements remain in their original positions.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n- **Test Input:** 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6\n- **Transformation:**\n  - The first '0' is at the 4th position (0-indexed).\n  - Shift this '0' one position to the right.\n\n### Test Output\n\nBy applying the rule, the test output grid will be:\n\n```python\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]\n\n# Find the first occurrence of 0 and shift it one position to the right\noutput_grid = input_grid[:]\nfor i in range(len(input_grid) - 1):\n    if input_grid[i] == 0:\n        output_grid[i], output_grid[i + 1] = output_grid[i + 1], output_grid[i]\n        break\n\n# Print the output grid\nprint(\"<<<\", \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)), \">>>\")\n```\n\nThe final output grid is:\n\n<<< 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 >>>",
    "To optimize the solution, we can focus on reducing the number of operations needed to find and shift the first occurrence of '0'. The current solution uses a loop to find the first '0' and then performs a swap operation. We can streamline this by using list slicing and concatenation, which can be more efficient in Python.\n\n### Optimized Plan\n\n1. **Identify the First '0':** Use the `index` method to find the first occurrence of '0'. This method is generally efficient for finding the first occurrence of an element in a list.\n2. **Shift the '0':** Use list slicing to construct the output grid by moving the first '0' one position to the right.\n3. **Concatenate the Parts:** Combine the parts of the list before and after the shifted '0' to form the final output grid.\n\n### Optimized Code\n\n```python\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]\n\n# Find the first occurrence of 0\nfirst_zero_index = input_grid.index(0)\n\n# Construct the output grid by shifting the first '0' one position to the right\noutput_grid = (\n    input_grid[:first_zero_index] +  # Elements before the first '0'\n    [input_grid[first_zero_index + 1]] +  # The element after the first '0'\n    [0] +  # The shifted '0'\n    input_grid[first_zero_index + 2:]  # Elements after the shifted '0'\n)\n\n# Print the output grid\nprint(\"<<<\", \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)), \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis optimized solution reduces the complexity by using list slicing and concatenation, which can be more efficient than manually swapping elements in a loop. The `index` method efficiently finds the first occurrence of '0', and the slicing operations are straightforward and concise."

    "The current solution correctly identifies the rule and applies it to the test input. However, the complexity score suggests that the code could be optimized further. Consider using more efficient searching techniques or symbolic computing to enhance the solution. Try to explore alternative methods to achieve the same result with potentially less computational overhead."
