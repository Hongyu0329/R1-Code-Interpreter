    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 8 8 2 2 2 0 0 0 8 8 8 2 2 2 2 0 0 0\n\n   Observations:\n   - The first two '2's in the input are transformed to '8's in the output.\n   - The first '2' in the second row is also transformed to '8'.\n   - The rest of the '2's remain unchanged.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 8 2 2 0 0 8 8 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n   Observations:\n   - The first '2' in the first row is transformed to '8'.\n   - The first two '2's in the second row are transformed to '8's.\n   - The rest of the '2's remain unchanged.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 8 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 2 2 2\n\n   Observations:\n   - The first '2' in the first row is transformed to '8'.\n   - The first three '2's in the second row are transformed to '8's.\n   - The rest of the '2's remain unchanged.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- Transform the first occurrence of '2' in each row to '8'.\n- If there are consecutive '2's starting from the first occurrence, transform them to '8' until a '0' or the end of the row is reached.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\n**Test Input:**\n2 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n- **First Row:** Transform the first five '2's to '8's (since they are consecutive and start from the first occurrence).\n- **Second Row:** Transform the first three '2's to '8's (since they are consecutive and start from the first occurrence).\n\n**Test Output:**\n8 8 8 8 8 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```python\nprint(\"<<<8 8 8 8 8 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>\")\n```"
