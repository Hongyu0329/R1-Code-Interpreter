    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: 2 1 0 0 9 4 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 2 1 0 0 9 4 0 0 3 0 0 0 0\n   - Observation: The first number (2) is moved to the second position, and the rest of the numbers are shifted to the right.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: 0 0 7 7 3 0 0 1 4 0 6 9 0 3\n   - Output: 0 0 0 7 7 3 0 0 1 4 0 6 9 3\n   - Observation: The first number (0) is moved to the third position, and the rest of the numbers are shifted to the right.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: 5 7 6 0 1 0 6 6 0 0 0 5 2 0\n   - Output: 0 5 7 6 0 1 0 6 6 0 0 0 5 2\n   - Observation: The first number (5) is moved to the second position, and the rest of the numbers are shifted to the right.\n\nFrom these examples, we can deduce the rule: The first number of the input grid is moved to the position where the first zero appears, and all numbers before that zero are shifted to the right.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- **Test Input:**\n  - Input: 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 3 0 0 4 6\n  - The first zero is already in the first position, so no shift is needed. The output will be the same as the input.\n\nTherefore, the output for the test input grid is:\n\n```python\nprint(\"<<<0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 3 0 0 4 6>>>\")\n```",
    "To develop a more generalized rule for transforming the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the examples more deeply to identify any consistent patterns or transformations:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: 2 1 0 0 9 4 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 2 1 0 0 9 4 0 0 3 0 0 0 0\n   - Transformation: The first non-zero element (2) is moved to the position of the first zero, and the elements before it are shifted right.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: 0 0 7 7 3 0 0 1 4 0 6 9 0 3\n   - Output: 0 0 0 7 7 3 0 0 1 4 0 6 9 3\n   - Transformation: The first non-zero element (7) is moved to the position of the first zero, and the elements before it are shifted right.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: 5 7 6 0 1 0 6 6 0 0 0 5 2 0\n   - Output: 0 5 7 6 0 1 0 6 6 0 0 0 5 2\n   - Transformation: The first non-zero element (5) is moved to the position of the first zero, and the elements before it are shifted right.\n\nFrom these observations, we can deduce a more generalized rule:\n- Identify the first non-zero element in the input grid.\n- Move this element to the position of the first zero in the grid.\n- Shift all elements before this zero to the right.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- **Test Input:**\n  - Input: 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 3 0 0 4 6\n  - The first non-zero element is 8, and the first zero is at position 0.\n  - Move 8 to the position of the first zero, and shift the elements before it to the right.\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero element\n    first_non_zero_index = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), None)\n    \n    # Find the first zero position\n    first_zero_index = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x == 0), None)\n    \n    # If there's no non-zero element or no zero, return the input as is\n    if first_non_zero_index is None or first_zero_index is None:\n        return input_grid\n    \n    # Create the output grid\n    output_grid = input_grid[:]\n    \n    # Move the first non-zero element to the first zero position\n    output_grid[first_zero_index] = input_grid[first_non_zero_index]\n    \n    # Shift elements before the first zero to the right\n    for i in range(first_zero_index):\n        output_grid[i] = input_grid[i + 1]\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 3, 0, 0, 4, 6]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will apply the generalized rule to the test input grid and print the transformed output grid.",
    "Let's re-evaluate the transformation rule and correct the logic to ensure it aligns with the expected output. Upon reviewing the examples, it seems the rule involves shifting the entire sequence to the right by one position and placing the first non-zero element at the start of the sequence. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Identify the first non-zero element in the input grid.\n2. Shift all elements to the right by one position.\n3. Place the first non-zero element at the start of the grid.\n\nLet's implement this corrected logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero element\n    first_non_zero_index = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), None)\n    \n    # If there's no non-zero element, return the input as is\n    if first_non_zero_index is None:\n        return input_grid\n    \n    # Create the output grid with the first non-zero element at the start\n    output_grid = [input_grid[first_non_zero_index]] + input_grid[:-1]\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 3, 0, 0, 4, 6]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code should correctly apply the transformation rule by placing the first non-zero element at the start and shifting the rest of the elements to the right.
