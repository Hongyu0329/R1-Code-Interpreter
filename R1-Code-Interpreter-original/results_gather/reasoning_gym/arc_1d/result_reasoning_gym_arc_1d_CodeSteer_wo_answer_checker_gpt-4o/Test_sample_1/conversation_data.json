    "The current solution provided by TaskLLM is incorrect. The rule derived does not match the transformation observed in the examples. The correct rule involves moving the first two numbers of the input to the end of the output, and shifting the rest of the numbers to the left. Please re-evaluate the examples and derive the correct transformation rule. Then, apply this rule to the test input to generate the correct output."
