    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 1 5 6 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 1 5 6\n   - Observation: The sequence \"5 1 5 6\" is moved to the end of the output grid.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0\n   - Output: 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Observation: The number \"9\" is moved to the start of the output grid.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: 3 9 1 4 3 7 5 2 1 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9\n   - Output: 0 0 0 9 3 9 1 4 3 7 5 2 1 9 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Observation: The sequence \"9 3 9 1 4 3 7 5 2 1 9\" is moved to the middle of the output grid.\n\n**Rule Derivation:**\n- The rule seems to involve identifying a non-zero sequence in the input grid and repositioning it in the output grid. The position where the sequence is moved seems to vary:\n  - In Example 1, the sequence is moved to the end.\n  - In Example 2, the sequence is moved to the start.\n  - In Example 3, the sequence is moved to the middle.\n\nGiven these observations, the rule might involve:\n- Identifying the longest contiguous non-zero sequence in the input.\n- Repositioning this sequence in the output grid based on some criteria (e.g., start, middle, end).\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n- Input: 8 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 7 2 8 4 5 1 8 2\n- The longest contiguous non-zero sequence is \"8 1 2\".\n- Based on the examples, we can try moving this sequence to the start of the output grid.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the longest contiguous non-zero sequence\n    longest_sequence = []\n    current_sequence = []\n    \n    for num in input_grid:\n        if num != 0:\n            current_sequence.append(num)\n        else:\n            if len(current_sequence) > len(longest_sequence):\n                longest_sequence = current_sequence\n            current_sequence = []\n    \n    # Check the last sequence\n    if len(current_sequence) > len(longest_sequence):\n        longest_sequence = current_sequence\n    \n    # Move the longest sequence to the start of the output grid\n    output_grid = longest_sequence + [0] * (len(input_grid) - len(longest_sequence))\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [8, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 7, 2, 8, 4, 5, 1, 8, 2]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output grid\nprint(\"<<<\", \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)), \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code identifies the longest contiguous non-zero sequence in the input grid and moves it to the start of the output grid, filling the rest with zeros. The final output grid is printed in the specified format.",
    "To refine the rule, let's analyze the examples more closely to determine the criteria for the position of the sequence in the output grid:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 1 5 6 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 1 5 6\n   - Observation: The sequence \"5 1 5 6\" is moved to the end of the output grid.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0\n   - Output: 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Observation: The number \"9\" is moved to the start of the output grid.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: 3 9 1 4 3 7 5 2 1 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9\n   - Output: 0 0 0 9 3 9 1 4 3 7 5 2 1 9 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Observation: The sequence \"9 3 9 1 4 3 7 5 2 1 9\" is moved to the middle of the output grid.\n\n**Refined Rule Derivation:**\n- The position of the sequence in the output grid seems to depend on its position in the input grid:\n  - If the sequence is at the end of the input, it remains at the end in the output.\n  - If the sequence is at the start of the input, it moves to the start in the output.\n  - If the sequence is in the middle, it moves to the middle in the output.\n\n**Plan:**\n1. Identify the longest contiguous non-zero sequence in the input grid.\n2. Determine the position of this sequence in the input grid (start, middle, or end).\n3. Move the sequence to the corresponding position in the output grid.\n\nLet's implement this refined rule:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the longest contiguous non-zero sequence\n    longest_sequence = []\n    current_sequence = []\n    start_index = 0\n    \n    for i, num in enumerate(input_grid):\n        if num != 0:\n            if not current_sequence:\n                start_index = i\n            current_sequence.append(num)\n        else:\n            if len(current_sequence) > len(longest_sequence):\n                longest_sequence = current_sequence\n                sequence_start_index = start_index\n            current_sequence = []\n    \n    # Check the last sequence\n    if len(current_sequence) > len(longest_sequence):\n        longest_sequence = current_sequence\n        sequence_start_index = start_index\n    \n    # Determine the position in the output grid\n    n = len(input_grid)\n    sequence_length = len(longest_sequence)\n    \n    if sequence_start_index == 0:\n        # Sequence is at the start\n        output_grid = longest_sequence + [0] * (n - sequence_length)\n    elif sequence_start_index + sequence_length == n:\n        # Sequence is at the end\n        output_grid = [0] * (n - sequence_length) + longest_sequence\n    else:\n        # Sequence is in the middle\n        middle_index = (n - sequence_length) // 2\n        output_grid = [0] * middle_index + longest_sequence + [0] * (n - sequence_length - middle_index)\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [8, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 7, 2, 8, 4, 5, 1, 8, 2]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output grid\nprint(\"<<<\", \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)), \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code identifies the longest contiguous non-zero sequence and places it in the output grid based on its position in the input grid, following the refined rule derived from the examples."

    "The current approach identifies the longest contiguous non-zero sequence and moves it to the start of the output grid. However, the examples suggest different positions for the sequence in the output grid. Consider implementing a more complex rule that determines the position based on specific criteria observed in the examples. For instance, analyze the position of the sequence in the input grid and its relation to the output grid position. Use symbolic computing or efficient searching to refine the rule and ensure it aligns with all given examples."
