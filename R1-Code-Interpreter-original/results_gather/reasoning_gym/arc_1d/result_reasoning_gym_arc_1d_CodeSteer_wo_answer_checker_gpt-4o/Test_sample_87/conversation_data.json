    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n### Analysis of Examples\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 1 2 1 2 0 0 2 2\n   - **Output:** 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 2 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 2 1 0\n   - **Output:** 2 2 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 1 1 2 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 1\n   - **Output:** 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations\n\n- The output grid always starts with a sequence of `2`s, followed by `1`s, and then `0`s.\n- The number of `2`s in the output seems to correspond to the number of `2`s in the input.\n- The number of `1`s in the output seems to correspond to the number of `1`s in the input.\n- The number of `0`s in the output fills the rest of the grid to maintain the same length as the input.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the observations, we can derive the following rule:\n- Count the number of `2`s in the input grid and place that many `2`s at the start of the output grid.\n- Count the number of `1`s in the input grid and place that many `1`s after the `2`s in the output grid.\n- Fill the rest of the output grid with `0`s to match the length of the input grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n- **Test Input:** 0 1 0 0 2 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 2 0\n\n1. Count the number of `2`s: There are 2 `2`s.\n2. Count the number of `1`s: There are 4 `1`s.\n3. The length of the input grid is 15, so the remaining 9 positions will be filled with `0`s.\n\n### Final Output\n\nThe output grid will be: 2 2 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n```python\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0]\n\n# Count occurrences of 2, 1, and 0\ncount_2 = input_grid.count(2)\ncount_1 = input_grid.count(1)\ncount_0 = len(input_grid) - count_2 - count_1\n\n# Construct the output grid\noutput_grid = [2] * count_2 + [1] * count_1 + [0] * count_0\n\n# Print the output grid\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThe final output is: <<<2 2 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
