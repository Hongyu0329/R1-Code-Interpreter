    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0\n\n   Observation: The sequence of 7s is shifted two positions to the right, and the leading zeros are extended.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n   - **Output:** 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n\n   Observation: The sequence remains unchanged as it is already fully filled with 7s.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0\n\n   Observation: The sequence of 9s is shifted three positions to the right, and the leading zeros are extended.\n\n**Rule Derivation:**\n- The rule seems to involve shifting the non-zero sequence to the right by a certain number of positions, and extending the leading zeros to fill the space.\n- The number of positions to shift seems to be determined by the number of leading zeros in the input.\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n- **Input:** 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nFollowing the rule:\n- The sequence of 8s should be shifted two positions to the right, and the leading zeros should be extended.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n```python\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n# Find the first non-zero element\nfirst_non_zero_index = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), None)\n\n# Calculate the number of leading zeros\nleading_zeros = first_non_zero_index\n\n# Shift the non-zero sequence to the right by the number of leading zeros\noutput_grid = [0] * leading_zeros + input_grid[leading_zeros:]\n\n# Print the output grid\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the transformed grid according to the derived rule.",
    "Let's revisit the problem and refine our approach to correctly implement the rule derived from the examples. The key observation is that the non-zero sequence is shifted to the right, and the leading zeros are extended to fill the space. The number of positions to shift seems to be determined by the number of leading zeros in the input.\n\n**Plan:**\n1. Identify the first and last non-zero elements in the input grid.\n2. Calculate the number of leading zeros before the first non-zero element.\n3. Shift the non-zero sequence to the right by the number of leading zeros.\n4. Extend the leading zeros to fill the space.\n\nLet's implement this logic in the code:\n\n```python\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n# Find the first and last non-zero elements\nfirst_non_zero_index = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), None)\nlast_non_zero_index = len(input_grid) - next((i for i, x in enumerate(reversed(input_grid)) if x != 0), None) - 1\n\n# Calculate the number of leading zeros\nleading_zeros = first_non_zero_index\n\n# Calculate the number of positions to shift\nshift_amount = leading_zeros\n\n# Create the output grid\noutput_grid = [0] * shift_amount + input_grid[first_non_zero_index:last_non_zero_index + 1] + [0] * (len(input_grid) - last_non_zero_index - 1)\n\n# Print the output grid\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code should correctly apply the rule by shifting the non-zero sequence to the right by the number of leading zeros and extending the leading zeros accordingly.",
