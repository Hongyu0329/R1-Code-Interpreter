    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0\n\n   Observations:\n   - The sequence of 6s in the input starts at index 7 and ends at index 26.\n   - In the output, the sequence of 6s starts at index 3 and ends at index 25.\n   - The sequence of 6s is shifted left by 4 positions.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n   Observations:\n   - The sequence of 2s in the input starts at index 6 and ends at index 20.\n   - In the output, the sequence of 2s starts at index 2 and ends at index 17.\n   - The sequence of 2s is shifted left by 4 positions.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n   Observations:\n   - The sequence of 5s in the input starts at index 4 and ends at index 25.\n   - In the output, the sequence of 5s starts at index 0 and ends at index 21.\n   - The sequence of 5s is shifted left by 4 positions.\n\n**Rule Derivation:**\nFrom the examples, we can deduce that the sequence of non-zero numbers in the input is shifted left by 4 positions in the output. The zeros at the beginning and end of the sequence are adjusted accordingly.\n\n**Test Input:**\n0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Applying the Rule:**\n- The sequence of 7s in the input starts at index 5 and ends at index 17.\n- Shift this sequence left by 4 positions.\n- The sequence of 7s in the output will start at index 1 and end at index 13.\n\n**Output:**\n0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
