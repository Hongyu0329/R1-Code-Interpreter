    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n### Analysis of Examples\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 3 3 3 3 3 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 0\n   - **Output:** 2 2 2 2 2 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 3 3 3 3 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0\n   - **Output:** 2 2 2 2 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 3 3 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n   - **Output:** 0 2 2 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n### Observations\n\n- The transformation seems to involve changing the number `3` to either `2` or `1`.\n- The first few `3`s in the input are transformed to `2`s in the output.\n- The remaining `3`s are transformed to `1`s.\n- The `0`s in the input remain `0`s in the output.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, it appears that:\n- The first sequence of `3`s in the input is transformed to `2`s in the output until a `0` is encountered.\n- After the first `0`, the remaining `3`s are transformed to `1`s.\n- `0`s remain unchanged.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nGiven the test input:\n- **Input:** 3 3 3 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0\n\nWe apply the rule:\n- Transform the first sequence of `3`s to `2`s until the first `0`.\n- After the first `0`, transform the remaining `3`s to `1`s.\n- Keep `0`s unchanged.\n\n### Test Output\n\nFollowing the rule, the output for the test input is:\n- **Output:** 2 2 2 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```plaintext\n<<<2 2 2 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0>>>\n```"
