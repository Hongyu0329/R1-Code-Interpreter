    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 2 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 2 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Observation: The first non-zero number (6) is shifted one position to the right, and all subsequent numbers are shifted accordingly.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: 0 6 9 7 7 3 1 2 2 7 3 2 3 9 8 3 7 9 0\n   - Output: 0 0 6 9 7 7 3 1 2 2 7 3 2 3 9 8 3 7 9\n   - Observation: The first non-zero number (6) is shifted one position to the right, and all subsequent numbers are shifted accordingly.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 7 2 1 1 3 1 3 5 0\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 7 2 1 1 3 1 3 5\n   - Observation: The first non-zero number (3) is shifted one position to the right, and all subsequent numbers are shifted accordingly.\n\nFrom these examples, we can deduce the rule: The first non-zero number in the input grid is shifted one position to the right, and all subsequent numbers are shifted accordingly. The leading zeros are preserved, and the trailing zero is removed.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- **Test Input:**\n  - Input: 0 9 2 1 2 8 6 6 9 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n  - The first non-zero number is 9, which should be shifted one position to the right, and all subsequent numbers should be shifted accordingly.\n\nLet's write the Python code to apply this rule and generate the output grid.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the index of the first non-zero element\n    first_non_zero_index = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), None)\n    \n    # If there is no non-zero element, return the input grid as is\n    if first_non_zero_index is None:\n        return input_grid\n    \n    # Create the output grid by shifting the first non-zero element and subsequent elements\n    output_grid = input_grid[:first_non_zero_index] + [0] + input_grid[first_non_zero_index:-1]\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = [0, 9, 2, 1, 2, 8, 6, 6, 9, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n# Get the output grid\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output grid\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThe output of this code will be the transformed grid according to the rule we identified."
