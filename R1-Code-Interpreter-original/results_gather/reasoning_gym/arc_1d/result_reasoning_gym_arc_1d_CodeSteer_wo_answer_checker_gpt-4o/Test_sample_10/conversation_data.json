    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 2 9 2 3 4 4 0\n   - Output: 2 9 2 3 4 4 0 0 0 0\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 4 4 2 1 1 0\n   - Output: 0 4 4 2 1 1 0 0 0 0\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 7 9 4 9 1 0 0\n   - Output: 7 9 4 9 1 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observations:**\n- In each example, the non-zero numbers from the input are shifted to the left in the output.\n- The number of zeros at the end of the output is equal to the number of zeros at the beginning of the input.\n- The sequence of non-zero numbers is preserved.\n\n**Rule:**\n- Identify the first non-zero number in the input.\n- Shift all non-zero numbers to the left, maintaining their order.\n- Append zeros to the end of the list to maintain the original length of the input.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n- **Test Input:**\n  - Input: 0 0 0 0 0 1 5 0 0 0\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Identify the first non-zero number: 1 (at index 5).\n2. Extract the non-zero sequence: 1, 5.\n3. Shift the non-zero sequence to the left: 1, 5.\n4. Append zeros to maintain the original length: 1, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.\n\n**Final Output:**\n- Output: 1 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nLet's write the Python code to implement this logic and produce the output.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Extract non-zero elements\n    non_zero_elements = [num for num in input_grid if num != 0]\n    # Calculate the number of zeros to append\n    num_zeros = len(input_grid) - len(non_zero_elements)\n    # Create the output grid\n    output_grid = non_zero_elements + [0] * num_zeros\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 0, 0, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output in the required format\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThe final output for the test input is:\n```\n<<<1 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>\n```"
