    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** `0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0`\n   - **Output:** `0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0`\n   - **Transformation:** The sequence of `3`s is shifted one position to the left, and the trailing `3`s are replaced with `0`s.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** `0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`\n   - **Output:** `0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`\n   - **Transformation:** The sequence of `2`s is shifted one position to the left, and the trailing `2`s are replaced with `0`s.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`\n   - **Output:** `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`\n   - **Transformation:** The sequence of `6`s is shifted one position to the left, and the trailing `6`s are replaced with `0`s.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can derive the following rule:\n- Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers.\n- Shift this sequence one position to the left.\n- Replace the last element of the sequence with `0`.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\n**Test Input:**\n`0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`\n\n- Identify the sequence of `6`s: `6 6 6 6 6 6`\n- Shift this sequence one position to the left: `6 6 6 6 6 0`\n- Replace the last `6` with `0`: `6 6 6 6 6 0`\n\n**Final Output:**\n`0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`\n\nThus, the output grid for the test input is:\n\n```python\nprint(\"<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>\")\n```"
