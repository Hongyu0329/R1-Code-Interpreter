    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 7 7 7 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 1 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Observation: The sequence of '7's in the input is shifted left to start immediately after the first non-zero number (1).\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: 1 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 1 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Observation: The sequence remains unchanged because the non-zero numbers are already contiguous.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: 1 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n   - Output: 1 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0\n   - Observation: The sequence of '7's is shifted left to start immediately after the first non-zero number (1), and the last '7' is replaced with a '0'.\n\n**Rule Derivation:**\n- Identify the first non-zero number in the input.\n- Shift any contiguous sequence of non-zero numbers (other than the first) to start immediately after the first non-zero number.\n- Replace the last number in the shifted sequence with '0' if it was shifted.\n\n**Test Input:**\n- Input: 1 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Applying the Rule:**\n- The first non-zero number is '1'.\n- The next non-zero number is '9', which should be shifted to start immediately after '1'.\n- The output should be: 1 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nLet's implement this in Python to verify:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero number\n    first_non_zero_index = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), None)\n    \n    if first_non_zero_index is None:\n        return input_grid  # No non-zero numbers found\n    \n    # Find the next non-zero sequence\n    next_non_zero_index = next((i for i in range(first_non_zero_index + 1, len(input_grid)) if input_grid[i] != 0), None)\n    \n    if next_non_zero_index is None:\n        return input_grid  # No further non-zero numbers found\n    \n    # Create the output grid\n    output_grid = input_grid[:first_non_zero_index + 1]\n    output_grid.extend(input_grid[next_non_zero_index:])\n    \n    # Replace the last number in the shifted sequence with '0'\n    if len(output_grid) > first_non_zero_index + 1:\n        output_grid[first_non_zero_index + 1] = 0\n    \n    # Fill the rest with zeros\n    output_grid.extend([0] * (len(input_grid) - len(output_grid)))\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [1, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThe output should be:\n```\n<<<1 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>\n```",
