    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 7 0 0 7 0 0 7 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of 7s in the input remains unchanged, but the trailing 7s after the first 0 are turned into 0s.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n   - **Observation:** The initial 1 is turned into 0, and the sequence of 1s starting from the first 1 in the input remains unchanged.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of 1s in the input remains unchanged, but the trailing 1s after the first 0 are turned into 0s.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can derive the following rule:\n- Identify the first occurrence of a non-zero number (let's call it `X`).\n- Retain the sequence of `X`s until a 0 is encountered.\n- After the first 0 following the sequence of `X`s, turn all subsequent numbers into 0s.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\n**Test Input:**\n0 5 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0\n\n- The first non-zero number is 5.\n- The sequence of 5s starts at index 1 and is interrupted by a 0 at index 2.\n- After the first 0 following the sequence of 5s, all numbers are turned into 0s.\n\n**Test Output:**\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThus, the output grid for the test input is:\n\n```python\nprint(\"<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>\")\n```",
    "To create a more robust solution that can dynamically identify patterns and transformations in the input grid, we can implement an algorithm that uses data structures to track sequences and changes. This approach will help us generalize the rule derivation process and handle a wider variety of input patterns.\n\n### Plan\n\n1. **Identify Sequences:**\n   - Traverse the input grid to identify sequences of non-zero numbers.\n   - Track the start and end indices of each sequence.\n\n2. **Determine Transformation:**\n   - For each sequence, determine if it should be retained or transformed based on the presence of zeros following the sequence.\n\n3. **Construct Output Grid:**\n   - Initialize an output grid with zeros.\n   - Retain sequences in the output grid based on the transformation rules derived.\n\n4. **Generalize the Rule:**\n   - Implement logic to handle different types of sequences and transformations dynamically.\n\n### Implementation\n\nLet's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    n = len(input_grid)\n    output_grid = [0] * n\n    i = 0\n\n    while i < n:\n        if input_grid[i] != 0:\n            # Start of a sequence\n            start = i\n            while i < n and input_grid[i] == input_grid[start]:\n                i += 1\n            end = i\n\n            # Check if the sequence should be retained\n            if i < n and input_grid[i] == 0:\n                # Retain the sequence\n                for j in range(start, end):\n                    output_grid[j] = input_grid[start]\n        else:\n            i += 1\n\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Identify Sequences:** We traverse the input grid and identify sequences of non-zero numbers. We track the start and end indices of each sequence.\n- **Determine Transformation:** For each sequence, we check if it is followed by a zero. If so, we retain the sequence in the output grid.\n- **Construct Output Grid:** We initialize the output grid with zeros and update it based on the sequences identified and the transformation rules.\n- **Generalize the Rule:** The algorithm dynamically handles different sequences and transformations, making it adaptable to various input patterns.\n\nThis approach provides a more flexible and generalized solution for transforming input grids based on identified patterns."
