    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0\n   - **Transformation:** The sequence of 6s is shifted two positions to the left.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Transformation:** The sequence of 6s is shifted two positions to the left.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Transformation:** The sequence of 6s is shifted two positions to the left.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can deduce that the rule involves shifting the sequence of non-zero numbers (6s in the examples) two positions to the left. The zeros at the beginning of the sequence are reduced by two, and two zeros are added to the end to maintain the same length.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Transformation:** Shift the sequence of 3s two positions to the left.\n\n### Test Output\n\nBy applying the rule, the output for the test input will be:\n\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
