    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 6 6 6 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 9\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observations:**\n- In each example, the sequence of non-zero numbers is shifted to the left or right.\n- The number '2' remains in the same position in the output as it is in the input.\n- The other non-zero numbers are shifted to the leftmost available positions in the output grid.\n\n**Rule Derivation:**\n- Identify the position of '2' in the input grid.\n- Shift all other non-zero numbers to the leftmost available positions, keeping '2' in its original position.\n\n**Test Input:**\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 2 0 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Applying the Rule:**\n- The number '2' is at index 4.\n- The sequence '7 7 7' should be shifted to the leftmost available positions, which are indices 0, 1, and 2.\n- The number '2' remains at index 4.\n\n**Output:**\n- 7 7 7 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to implement this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the position of '2'\n    pos_of_2 = input_grid.index(2)\n    \n    # Extract non-zero numbers except '2'\n    non_zero_numbers = [num for num in input_grid if num != 0 and num != 2]\n    \n    # Create the output grid with zeros\n    output_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\n    \n    # Place '2' in its original position\n    output_grid[pos_of_2] = 2\n    \n    # Place other non-zero numbers to the leftmost available positions\n    for i, num in enumerate(non_zero_numbers):\n        output_grid[i] = num\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output grid\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the transformed grid according to the derived rule."
