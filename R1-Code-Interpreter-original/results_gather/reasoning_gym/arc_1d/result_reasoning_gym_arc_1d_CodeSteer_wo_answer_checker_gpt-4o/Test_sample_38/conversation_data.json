    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1 Analysis:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 9 2 7 4 7 7 4 3 2 6 3 8 0 0 0\n   - Output: 9 2 7 4 7 7 4 3 2 6 3 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Observation: The first four zeros are removed, and the remaining numbers are shifted to the left. The output ends with zeros to maintain the same length as the input.\n\n2. **Example 2 Analysis:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 1 2 2 8 7 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 0 8 1 2 2 8 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Observation: The leading zeros are reduced to five, and the rest of the numbers are shifted to the left. The output ends with zeros to maintain the same length as the input.\n\n3. **Example 3 Analysis:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 2 8 5 1 3 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 0 8 2 8 5 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Observation: The leading zeros are reduced to five, and the rest of the numbers are shifted to the left. The output ends with zeros to maintain the same length as the input.\n\n**Rule Derivation:**\n- The rule seems to be that we remove the leading zeros until we reach the first non-zero number, then shift the remaining numbers to the left, and finally pad the end with zeros to maintain the original length of the input.\n\n**Applying the Rule to the Test Input:**\n- Test Input: 0 0 0 0 6 3 5 1 7 9 1 2 4 9 6 3 2 0 0\n- Remove leading zeros until the first non-zero number: 6 3 5 1 7 9 1 2 4 9 6 3 2\n- Pad with zeros to maintain the original length: 6 3 5 1 7 9 1 2 4 9 6 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThus, the output for the test input is:\n\n```<<<6 3 5 1 7 9 1 2 4 9 6 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>```"
