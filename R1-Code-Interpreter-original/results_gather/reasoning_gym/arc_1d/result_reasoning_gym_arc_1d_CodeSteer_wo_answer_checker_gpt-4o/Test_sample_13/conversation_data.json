    "To solve this problem, we need to identify a pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2 2 1 0 2 2 1 2 2 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 1 2 2 2 2 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 2 1 2\n   - **Output:** 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 2 1 0 0 1 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 1\n   - **Output:** 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n### Observations\n\n- The output grid always starts with a sequence of 2s, followed by 0s, and ends with 1s.\n- The number of 2s in the output seems to be the count of 2s in the input grid.\n- The number of 1s in the output seems to be the count of 1s in the input grid.\n- The rest of the output is filled with 0s.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the observations, we can derive the following rule:\n- Count the number of 2s in the input grid. This count will determine the number of 2s at the start of the output grid.\n- Count the number of 1s in the input grid. This count will determine the number of 1s at the end of the output grid.\n- Fill the remaining positions in the output grid with 0s.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n- **Test Input:** 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 2 0 0 0 0\n\n1. Count of 2s: 4\n2. Count of 1s: 3\n3. Total length of the grid: 23\n\nThe output grid will have:\n- 4 twos at the start\n- 3 ones at the end\n- The rest (16 positions) filled with zeros\n\n### Final Output\n\nThe final output grid is:\n\n```python\noutput_grid = [2, 2, 2, 2] + [0] * 16 + [1, 1, 1]\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the final answer in the required format.",
    "To create a more sophisticated solution that can dynamically analyze and transform the input grid, we can use a symbolic computing approach. This involves identifying patterns and relationships in the input data and using them to derive a transformation rule. We can use Python's data structures to efficiently map input values to output values and employ symbolic computing techniques to generalize the transformation rule.\n\n### Plan\n\n1. **Data Structure Choice:** Use a dictionary to count occurrences of each unique number in the input grid. This will help us dynamically determine the number of each element in the output grid.\n\n2. **Pattern Recognition:** Identify the pattern in the input grid by analyzing the frequency of each number. Use this information to determine the order and count of numbers in the output grid.\n\n3. **Generalized Transformation Rule:** Develop a rule that can adapt to different input scenarios by using the frequency data to construct the output grid.\n\n4. **Implementation:** Implement the solution using Python, ensuring that it can handle a variety of input grids beyond the given examples.\n\n### Implementation\n\nLet's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Count occurrences of each number in the input grid\n    frequency = {}\n    for number in input_grid:\n        if number in frequency:\n            frequency[number] += 1\n        else:\n            frequency[number] = 1\n\n    # Determine the order of numbers in the output grid\n    # Based on the examples, we prioritize 2s, then 0s, then 1s\n    output_grid = []\n    if 2 in frequency:\n        output_grid.extend([2] * frequency[2])\n    if 0 in frequency:\n        output_grid.extend([0] * (len(input_grid) - frequency[2] - frequency.get(1, 0)))\n    if 1 in frequency:\n        output_grid.extend([1] * frequency[1])\n\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Frequency Counting:** We use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each number in the input grid.\n- **Output Construction:** We construct the output grid by first adding the counted 2s, then filling with 0s, and finally adding the counted 1s.\n- **Generalization:** This approach can handle any input grid with numbers 0, 1, and 2, and will dynamically adjust the output based on the input frequencies.\n\nThis solution is more adaptable and can handle a wider range of input scenarios by leveraging symbolic computing techniques to derive a generalized transformation rule."
