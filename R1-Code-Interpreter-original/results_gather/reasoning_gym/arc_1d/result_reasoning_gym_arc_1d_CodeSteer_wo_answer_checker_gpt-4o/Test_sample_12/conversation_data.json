    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the examples provided:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** `0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0`\n   - **Output:** `0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0`\n   - **Observation:** The first and last '9' in the sequence are retained, and the rest are replaced with '0'.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`\n   - **Output:** `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`\n   - **Observation:** The first and last '3' in the sequence are retained, and the rest are replaced with '0'.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** `5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`\n   - **Output:** `5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`\n   - **Observation:** The first and last '5' in the sequence are retained, and the rest are replaced with '0'.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can derive the following rule:\n- Identify the contiguous block of non-zero numbers in the input.\n- Retain the first and last numbers of this block in the output.\n- Replace all other numbers in the block with '0'.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\n**Test Input:**\n`2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`\n\n- The contiguous block of non-zero numbers is all the '2's.\n- Retain the first and last '2' in the output.\n- Replace all other '2's with '0'.\n\n**Test Output:**\n`2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
