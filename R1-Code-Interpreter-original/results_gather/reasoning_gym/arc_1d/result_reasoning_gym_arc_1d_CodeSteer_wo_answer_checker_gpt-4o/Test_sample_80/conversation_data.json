    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid in the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1 Analysis:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 4 0 4 0 6 3 0 0 7 2 4 2 0 0 0 4 9 1 0 7 0 0 7 2\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 5 0 5 0 5 5 0 0 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 5 5\n   - Observation: All non-zero numbers in the input are replaced by 5 in the output.\n\n2. **Example 2 Analysis:**\n   - Input: 5 3 4 0 2 2 0 0 8 9 0 1 0 0 0 0 7 9 5 0 3 0 0 2 7 0 0 6\n   - Output: 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 0 5 5 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 5 5 0 0 5\n   - Observation: Again, all non-zero numbers in the input are replaced by 5 in the output.\n\n3. **Example 3 Analysis:**\n   - Input: 3 9 8 9 0 1 0 5 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 3 4 0 9 5 0 3 6 8 5 0\n   - Output: 5 5 5 5 0 5 0 5 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 0\n   - Observation: Consistently, all non-zero numbers are replaced by 5.\n\n**Rule Derivation:**\nFrom the analysis, the rule is clear: replace every non-zero number in the input grid with 5 in the output grid. Zeroes remain unchanged.\n\n**Applying the Rule to the Test Input:**\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid.\n\n```python\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = [0, 2, 9, 6, 0, 4, 7, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 0, 2, 0, 7, 9, 0, 6, 6, 4, 0, 9, 0]\n\n# Apply the rule: replace non-zero numbers with 5\noutput_grid = [5 if x != 0 else 0 for x in input_grid]\n\n# Print the output grid\nprint(\"<<<\", \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)), \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will transform the test input grid according to the derived rule and print the output in the specified format."
