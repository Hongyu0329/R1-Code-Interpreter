    "To solve this problem, we need to identify a pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n   - Observation: The first non-zero number (2) in the input is replaced by the number that follows it (8) in the output.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: 0 2 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Observation: The first non-zero number (2) in the input is replaced by the number that follows it (9) in the output.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n   - Observation: The first non-zero number (2) in the input is replaced by the number that follows it (3) in the output.\n\n**Rule Derivation:**\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the rule:\n- Identify the first non-zero number in the input grid.\n- Replace this number with the number that follows it in the sequence.\n- The rest of the grid remains unchanged.\n\n**Applying the Rule to the Test Input:**\n- Input: 2 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n- The first non-zero number is 2, and the number that follows it is 4.\n- Replace 2 with 4, resulting in the output grid.\n\nThus, the output grid for the test input is:\n<<<4 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4>>>",
