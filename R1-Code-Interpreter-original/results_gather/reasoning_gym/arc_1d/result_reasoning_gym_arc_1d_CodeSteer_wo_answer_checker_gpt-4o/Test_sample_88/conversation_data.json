    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: 4 4 4 0 4 4 0 4 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 4 0 4 4 0 4 4 4 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: 4 0 4 4 4 0 4 4 4 4 0 4 4 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 4 0 4 4 0 4 4 4 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 0 6 0 6 6 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observations:**\n- The first element of the output is the same as the first element of the input.\n- The second element of the output is always 0.\n- The third element of the output is the same as the third element of the input.\n- The fourth element of the output is the same as the fourth element of the input.\n- The fifth element of the output is always 0.\n- The rest of the elements in the output are the same as the corresponding elements in the input.\n\n**Rule:**\n- The output grid is formed by setting the second and fifth elements to 0, while keeping the rest of the elements the same as the input grid.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- **Test Input:**\n  - 5 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 0 0 0\n\n- **Applying the Rule:**\n  - The first element remains 5.\n  - The second element becomes 0.\n  - The third element remains 5.\n  - The fourth element remains 5.\n  - The fifth element becomes 0.\n  - The rest of the elements remain the same.\n\n- **Test Output:**\n  - 5 0 5 5 0 0 5 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 0 0 0\n\nLet's output the final answer:\n\n```python\ntest_input = [5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\ntest_output = test_input[:]\ntest_output[1] = 0\ntest_output[4] = 0\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, test_output)) + \">>>\")\n```",
    "Thank you for the feedback. While the current solution effectively addresses the specific pattern identified in the examples, I understand the importance of developing more robust and adaptable solutions that can handle a wider range of patterns. Here are some thoughts on how we might enhance the solution using more advanced techniques:\n\n1. **Symbolic Computing:**\n   - Symbolic computing can be used to represent and manipulate mathematical expressions symbolically rather than numerically. This could be useful if the transformation rules involve more complex mathematical operations or symbolic relationships.\n\n2. **Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning:**\n   - Machine learning models, such as decision trees or neural networks, could be trained on a set of input-output pairs to learn the transformation rules. This approach would be beneficial for more complex patterns that are not easily discernible through manual inspection.\n\n3. **Efficient Searching and Optimization:**\n   - Techniques such as dynamic programming or constraint satisfaction could be employed to efficiently search for transformation rules that minimize some cost function or satisfy certain constraints.\n\n4. **Generalization and Abstraction:**\n   - Developing a more abstract representation of the problem could help in generalizing the solution to a broader class of problems. This might involve identifying higher-level features or properties of the input-output pairs.\n\nFor the current task, the pattern was relatively simple, so a straightforward approach was sufficient. However, for more complex tasks, incorporating these advanced techniques could improve the solution's robustness and adaptability.\n\nIf you have a specific complex pattern or task in mind, feel free to share it, and I can attempt to apply some of these techniques to develop a solution."
