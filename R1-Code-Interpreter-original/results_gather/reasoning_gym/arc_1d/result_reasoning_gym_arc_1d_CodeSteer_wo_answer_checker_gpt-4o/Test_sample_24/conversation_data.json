    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the examples provided:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observations:**\n- The transformation involves shifting the non-zero sequence to the right by a certain number of positions.\n- The number of zeros at the beginning of the output is increased compared to the input.\n- The non-zero sequence in the input is preserved in the output but shifted to the right.\n\n**Rule Derivation:**\n- The non-zero sequence in the input is shifted to the right by the number of leading zeros in the input.\n- The output starts with zeros, and the non-zero sequence is placed after these zeros.\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0\n- The non-zero sequence is \"5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\".\n- There are 10 leading zeros in the input.\n\n**Applying the Rule:**\n- Shift the non-zero sequence to the right by 10 positions.\n- The output will have 10 zeros at the start, followed by the non-zero sequence, and then the remaining zeros.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to generate the output grid.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Count leading zeros\n    leading_zeros = 0\n    for num in input_grid:\n        if num == 0:\n            leading_zeros += 1\n        else:\n            break\n    \n    # Find the non-zero sequence\n    non_zero_sequence = input_grid[leading_zeros:]\n    non_zero_sequence = [num for num in non_zero_sequence if num != 0]\n    \n    # Create the output grid\n    output_grid = [0] * leading_zeros + non_zero_sequence + [0] * (len(input_grid) - leading_zeros - len(non_zero_sequence))\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output grid\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThe output will be the transformed grid according to the derived rule."
