    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1 Analysis:**\n   - Input: 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Observation: The sequence of 9s is shifted left to start immediately after the first non-zero number (2).\n\n2. **Example 2 Analysis:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Observation: The sequence of 5s is shifted left to start immediately after the first non-zero number (2).\n\n3. **Example 3 Analysis:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n   - Observation: The sequence of 5s is shifted left to start immediately after the first non-zero number (2).\n\n**Rule Derivation:**\nThe rule seems to be that the sequence of repeated numbers (e.g., 9s, 5s) is shifted left to start immediately after the first non-zero number in the input grid.
