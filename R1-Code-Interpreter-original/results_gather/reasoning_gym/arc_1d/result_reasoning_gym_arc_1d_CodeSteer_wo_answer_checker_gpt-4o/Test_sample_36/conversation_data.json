    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid in the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The first row of 2s is transformed into 1s, while the rest of the grid remains unchanged.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 4 4 0 4 4 4 4 4 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 4 4 0 4 4 4 4 4 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The second row of 4s is transformed into 1s, while the rest of the grid remains unchanged.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 6 6 6 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The third row of 6s is transformed into 1s, while the rest of the grid remains unchanged.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- Identify the first row in the grid that contains a sequence of identical non-zero numbers.\n- Transform that entire row of identical numbers into 1s.\n- Leave the rest of the grid unchanged.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\n**Test Input:**\n0 0 0 9 9 9 9 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0\n\n- The first row with a sequence of identical non-zero numbers is the third row (9 9 9 9).\n- Transform this row into 1s.\n\n**Test Output:**\n0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0>>>",
