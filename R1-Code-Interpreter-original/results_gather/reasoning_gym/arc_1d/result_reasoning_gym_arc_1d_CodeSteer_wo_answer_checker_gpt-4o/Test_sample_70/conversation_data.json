    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of 9s in the input is shifted to the right by 5 positions in the output.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n   - **Output:** 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of 3s in the input is shifted to the right by 3 positions in the output.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of 7s in the input is shifted to the right by 9 positions in the output.\n\n**Rule Derivation:**\nFrom the examples, we can see that the sequence of non-zero numbers in the input is shifted to the right by a number of positions equal to the count of leading zeros in the input sequence. \n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n- **Input:** 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n- The sequence of 1s starts at the beginning and is followed by 8 zeros before the next sequence of 1s.\n- According to the rule, the sequence of 1s should be shifted to the right by 8 positions.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input to get the output.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero number\n    first_non_zero_index = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), None)\n    \n    # Count the number of leading zeros before the first non-zero number\n    leading_zeros = first_non_zero_index\n    \n    # Shift the sequence of non-zero numbers to the right by the number of leading zeros\n    output_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\n    non_zero_sequence = [x for x in input_grid if x != 0]\n    output_grid[leading_zeros:leading_zeros + len(non_zero_sequence)] = non_zero_sequence\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output in the required format\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThe output will be the transformed grid according to the derived rule."
