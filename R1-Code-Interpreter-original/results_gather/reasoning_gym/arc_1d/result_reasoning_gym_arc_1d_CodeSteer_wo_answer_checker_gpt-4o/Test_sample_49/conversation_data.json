    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 6 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 6 6 0 6 6 6 0\n   - **Output:** 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 6 6 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 6 6 0 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0\n   - **Output:** 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations\n\n- The output grid seems to be a rearrangement of the input grid.\n- The first few elements of the output grid are non-zero numbers from the input grid, followed by zeros.\n- The non-zero numbers in the output appear to be shifted to the left, maintaining their order.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the observations, the rule can be summarized as:\n1. Extract all non-zero numbers from the input grid.\n2. Place these non-zero numbers at the beginning of the output grid.\n3. Fill the remaining positions in the output grid with zeros.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nGiven the test input:\n- **Input:** 0 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0 0\n\nFollowing the derived rule:\n1. Extract non-zero numbers: 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7\n2. Place them at the beginning of the output grid.\n3. Fill the rest with zeros.\n\nThus, the output grid will be:\n- **Output:** 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final output grid is:\n\n<<<7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
