    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1 Analysis:**\n   - Input: 0 0 2 7 9 8 3 2 1 5 3 6 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 9 8 3 2 1 5 3 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 7\n   - Observation: The sequence of numbers from the input starting from the first non-zero number (2) to the last non-zero number (6) is moved to the beginning of the output. The remaining numbers (0s) are shifted to the end, and the initial non-zero numbers (2 and 7) are appended at the end.\n\n2. **Example 2 Analysis:**\n   - Input: 9 5 1 3 8 3 8 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n   - Output: 8 3 8 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 9 5 1 3\n   - Observation: The sequence of numbers from the input starting from the first non-zero number (9) to the last non-zero number (3) is moved to the end of the output. The remaining numbers (0s) are shifted to the beginning, and the initial non-zero numbers (9, 5, 1, 3) are appended at the end.\n\n3. **Example 3 Analysis:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Observation: The sequence of numbers from the input starting from the first non-zero number (3) to the last non-zero number (3) is moved to the middle of the output. The remaining numbers (0s) are shifted to the beginning and end.\n\n**Rule Derivation:**\n- Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers in the input.\n- Move this sequence to the beginning of the output.\n- Shift the remaining zeros to the end.\n- Append the initial sequence of non-zero numbers at the end.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n- **Test Input:**\n  - Input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 2 7 0\n\n- **Applying the Rule:**\n  - Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers: 7, 2, 7\n  - Move this sequence to the beginning of the output.\n  - Shift the remaining zeros to the end.\n\nLet's write the Python code to implement this rule and find the output for the test input.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers\n    non_zero_sequence = [num for num in input_grid if num != 0]\n    \n    # Count the number of zeros\n    zero_count = len(input_grid) - len(non_zero_sequence)\n    \n    # Create the output grid\n    output_grid = non_zero_sequence + [0] * zero_count\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 2, 7, 0]\n\n# Get the output grid\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output in the required format\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThe output for the test input will be:\n\n```\n<<<7 2 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>\n```",
    "To enhance the solution's efficiency and adaptability, we can consider using more advanced techniques such as symbolic computing or efficient searching algorithms. However, given the simplicity of the problem, the current approach is already quite efficient. The task primarily involves identifying non-zero elements and rearranging them, which is linear in complexity, O(n), where n is the length of the input grid.\n\nFor more complex patterns or larger datasets, we could consider using data structures like deques for efficient appending and popping operations, or even numpy arrays for vectorized operations if the problem scales up significantly. However, for the current problem, these optimizations might not provide significant benefits due to the simplicity of the operations involved.\n\nLet's consider a slightly optimized approach using Python's built-in capabilities, which can handle larger datasets more efficiently by leveraging list comprehensions and built-in functions.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef transform_grid_optimized(input_grid):\n    # Use deque for efficient appending\n    non_zero_sequence = deque()\n    \n    # Collect non-zero numbers\n    for num in input_grid:\n        if num != 0:\n            non_zero_sequence.append(num)\n    \n    # Count the number of zeros\n    zero_count = len(input_grid) - len(non_zero_sequence)\n    \n    # Create the output grid\n    output_grid = list(non_zero_sequence) + [0] * zero_count\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 2, 7, 0]\n\n# Get the output grid\noutput_grid = transform_grid_optimized(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output in the required format\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code uses a `deque` to efficiently collect non-zero numbers, which can be beneficial if we need to perform more complex operations on the sequence. However, for the current problem size, the performance difference might be negligible. The key takeaway is that the solution is already efficient for the given task, and further optimizations would be more relevant for significantly larger or more complex datasets."
