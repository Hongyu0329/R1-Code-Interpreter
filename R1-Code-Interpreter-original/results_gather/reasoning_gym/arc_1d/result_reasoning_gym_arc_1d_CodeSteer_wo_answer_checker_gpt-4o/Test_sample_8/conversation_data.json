    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence \"5 5\" is moved from the 7th and 8th positions to the 25th and 26th positions.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence \"8 8 8 8 8\" is moved from the 17th to 21st positions to the 1st to 5th positions.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence \"6 6 6 6\" is moved from the 24th to 27th positions to the 2nd to 5th positions.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can derive the following rule:\n- Identify the non-zero sequence in the input grid.\n- Move this sequence to the leftmost available position in the output grid, maintaining the order of the sequence.\n- The rest of the grid remains unchanged except for the positions where the sequence was moved from.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\n**Test Input:**\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0\n\n- The non-zero sequence is \"3 3 3 3 3 3 3\" starting from the 19th position.\n- Move this sequence to the leftmost available position, which is the 1st position.\n\n**Test Output:**\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```python\nprint(\"<<<3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>\")\n```",
    "To enhance the solution's robustness and adaptability, we can implement a more dynamic approach that can handle larger grids and more complex patterns. This involves identifying sequences of non-zero numbers and moving them to the leftmost available position. We can achieve this by using a more systematic approach to identify and manipulate sequences within the grid.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to implement this:\n\n1. **Identify Non-Zero Sequences:**\n   - Traverse the grid to identify contiguous sequences of non-zero numbers.\n\n2. **Determine the Leftmost Position:**\n   - Calculate the leftmost position where the sequence can be moved without overlapping other sequences.\n\n3. **Move the Sequence:**\n   - Shift the identified sequence to the leftmost position.\n\n4. **Reconstruct the Grid:**\n   - Fill the rest of the grid with zeros, maintaining the position of any other numbers that should remain unchanged.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Identify non-zero sequences\n    sequences = []\n    current_sequence = []\n    \n    for num in input_grid:\n        if num != 0:\n            current_sequence.append(num)\n        else:\n            if current_sequence:\n                sequences.append(current_sequence)\n                current_sequence = []\n    \n    if current_sequence:\n        sequences.append(current_sequence)\n    \n    # Create the output grid\n    output_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\n    \n    # Place sequences at the leftmost positions\n    position = 0\n    for sequence in sequences:\n        for num in sequence:\n            output_grid[position] = num\n            position += 1\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\n# Transform the grid\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output in the required format\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code dynamically identifies sequences of non-zero numbers and moves them to the leftmost available position in the grid. It is designed to handle larger grids and more complex patterns by systematically processing the input grid."

    "The current solution correctly identifies the rule and applies it to the test input. However, to ensure robustness and handle more complex scenarios, consider implementing a more sophisticated approach that can dynamically identify and manipulate sequences within the grid. This could involve symbolic computing or efficient searching algorithms to handle larger grids or more complex patterns. Try to enhance the code by incorporating these elements to improve its complexity and adaptability."
