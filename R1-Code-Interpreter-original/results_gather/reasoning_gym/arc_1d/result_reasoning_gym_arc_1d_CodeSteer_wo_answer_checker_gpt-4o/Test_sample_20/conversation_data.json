    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n### Analysis of Examples\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 1 0 2 0 0 1 2 1\n   - **Output:** 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 1 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 1 2 2 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0\n   - **Output:** 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1\n\n### Observations\n\n- The first two elements of the output are always `2 2`.\n- The sequence of zeros in the input is preserved in the output.\n- The sequence of ones in the input is shifted to the end of the output.\n- The number of ones in the output matches the number of ones in the input.\n- The number of twos in the input does not directly affect the output except for the initial `2 2`.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nBased on the observations, the rule can be described as follows:\n1. Start the output with `2 2`.\n2. Append zeros from the input in the same order.\n3. Append ones from the input in the same order.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n- **Test Input:** 0 1 2 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 2\n\n1. Start with `2 2`.\n2. Append zeros: `0 0 0 0`.\n3. Append ones: `1 1 1 1`.\n\nThus, the output for the test input is `2 2 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```python\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2]\n\n# Applying the derived rule\noutput_grid = [2, 2]  # Start with two 2s\noutput_grid.extend([x for x in input_grid if x == 0])  # Append zeros\noutput_grid.extend([x for x in input_grid if x == 1])  # Append ones\n\n# Print the final output grid\nprint(\"<<<\", \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)), \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the final answer in the required format."
