    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of '1's at the end of the input is extended to replace the trailing '0's in the output.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 5 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 5 5 5 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of '5's at the beginning of the input is extended to replace the leading '0's in the output.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of '2's at the beginning of the input is extended to replace the leading '0's in the output.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can derive the following rule:\n- Identify the first non-zero sequence in the input grid.\n- Extend this sequence to replace any leading '0's in the output grid.\n- Identify the last non-zero sequence in the input grid.\n- Extend this sequence to replace any trailing '0's in the output grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\n**Test Input:**\n0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n- The first non-zero sequence is '3', which should replace the leading '0's.\n- The last non-zero sequence is '2', which should replace the trailing '0's.\n\n**Test Output:**\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nThus, the final output grid is:\n\n```python\nprint(\"<<<3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2>>>\")\n```"
