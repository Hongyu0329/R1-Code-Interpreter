    "To solve this problem, we need to identify a pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5\n   - Output: 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5\n   - Observation: The sequence of numbers is shifted to the right, and the first number is moved to the end.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n   - Output: 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\n   - Observation: The sequence of numbers is shifted to the right, and the first number is moved to the end.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0\n   - Output: 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 7\n   - Observation: The sequence of numbers is shifted to the right, and the first number is moved to the end.\n\nFrom these observations, we can deduce that the rule is to shift the entire sequence to the right by one position, and the first number in the input sequence is moved to the last position in the output sequence.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- **Test Input:**\n  - Input: 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n  - Applying the rule: Shift the sequence to the right by one position, and move the first number (4) to the end.\n\nThe output grid will be:\n\n- **Output:**\n  - 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n\nThus, the output for the test input grid is the same as the input grid because all elements are identical, and shifting them doesn't change the sequence.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```\n<<<4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4>>>\n```"
