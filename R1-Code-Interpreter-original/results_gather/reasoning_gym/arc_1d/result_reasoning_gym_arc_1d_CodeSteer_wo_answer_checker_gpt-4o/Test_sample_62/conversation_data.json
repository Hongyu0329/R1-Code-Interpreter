    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 8 8 0 0 1 1 0 0 8 8 0 0 7 0 0\n   - **Output:** 8 8 3 3 1 1 3 3 8 8 3 0 7 0 0\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 6 6 0 0\n   - **Output:** 1 0 0 0 0 3 1 1 3 0 3 6 6 3 0\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 5 5 0 0 2 2 0 0 6 0 0 0 1 1 0\n   - **Output:** 5 5 3 3 2 2 3 0 6 0 0 3 1 1 3\n\n### Observations\n\n- The number `3` is inserted in the output grid at specific positions.\n- The number `3` appears to be inserted after every sequence of non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n- The number `3` is not inserted if the sequence is followed by another non-zero number or if it is at the end of the grid.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nBased on the observations, the rule can be described as follows:\n- Traverse the input grid.\n- For each non-zero number, check if it is followed by a zero or the end of the grid.\n- If so, insert a `3` after the sequence of non-zero numbers.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- **Input:** 4 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 9 9 9 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 4 3 0 0 5 5 3 0 0 3 9 9 9 3 0 0 0 0\n\nThe number `3` is inserted after the sequences `4`, `5 5`, and `9 9 9`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<4 3 0 0 5 5 3 0 0 3 9 9 9 3 0 0 0 0>>>",
    "To implement a more robust solution that can handle larger and more complex grids, we can create a function that dynamically identifies patterns and applies transformations based on the rules we've derived. This function will iterate through the grid, identify sequences of non-zero numbers, and insert the number `3` appropriately.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan for the implementation:\n\n1. **Initialize an Output List:** Start with an empty list to store the transformed grid.\n\n2. **Iterate Through the Input Grid:** Use a loop to traverse each element in the input grid.\n\n3. **Identify Non-Zero Sequences:** For each non-zero number, check if it is followed by a zero or the end of the grid.\n\n4. **Insert the Number `3`:** If the conditions are met, append the number `3` to the output list after the sequence of non-zero numbers.\n\n5. **Handle Edge Cases:** Ensure that the function correctly handles cases where the grid ends with a non-zero number or has consecutive zeros.\n\n6. **Return the Transformed Grid:** Convert the output list back to the desired format and return it.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    output_grid = []\n    n = len(input_grid)\n    \n    i = 0\n    while i < n:\n        output_grid.append(input_grid[i])\n        \n        # Check if the current number is non-zero and followed by a zero or end of grid\n        if input_grid[i] != 0:\n            if i + 1 < n and input_grid[i + 1] == 0:\n                output_grid.append(3)\n            elif i + 1 == n:\n                output_grid.append(3)\n        \n        i += 1\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [4, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `transform_grid` that processes the input grid according to the derived rules and outputs the transformed grid. The function is designed to handle various edge cases and should work efficiently for larger grids as well."

    "The current solution seems to correctly identify the rule and apply it to the test input. However, to ensure robustness and handle more complex cases, consider implementing a more sophisticated approach using symbolic computing or efficient searching techniques. This could involve creating a function that dynamically identifies patterns and applies transformations based on a set of rules. This approach will help in handling larger and more complex grids effectively."
