    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 6 2 6 2 5 5 8 6 8 5 7 1 7 8 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 7 1 7 5 8 6 8 5 5 2 6 2 6 9 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence from the 11th to the 26th position is reversed.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 3 5 6 2 8 5 1 4 6 7 1 1 1 4 4 2 1 1 8 5 1 8 4 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 4 8 1 5 8 1 1 2 4 4 1 1 1 7 6 4 1 5 8 2 6 5 3 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence from the 1st to the 24th position is reversed.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 3 3 5 6 2 7 2 4 6 6 6 1 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 8 1 6 6 6 4 2 7 2 6 5 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence from the 3rd to the 16th position is reversed.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, it appears that the transformation involves reversing a specific segment of the input grid. The segment to be reversed starts from the first non-zero number and ends at the last non-zero number in the input grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\n**Test Input:**\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n- The first non-zero number is at the 11th position (3), and the last non-zero number is at the 12th position (8).\n- Reverse the segment from the 11th to the 12th position.\n\n**Test Output:**\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThus, the output grid for the test input is:\n\n```python\nprint(\"<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>\")\n```",
    "To create a more robust solution that can dynamically identify and reverse the relevant segment in any given input grid, we can implement a Python function that follows these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Segment:**\n   - Traverse the input list to find the first and last non-zero elements. This will define the segment that needs to be reversed.\n\n2. **Reverse the Segment:**\n   - Reverse the identified segment while keeping the rest of the list unchanged.\n\n3. **Output the Result:**\n   - Print the modified list as the output.\n\nHere's the Python code implementing this approach:\n\n```python\ndef reverse_segment(input_grid):\n    # Find the first and last non-zero indices\n    first_non_zero = None\n    last_non_zero = None\n    \n    for i, value in enumerate(input_grid):\n        if value != 0:\n            if first_non_zero is None:\n                first_non_zero = i\n            last_non_zero = i\n    \n    # If no non-zero elements are found, return the input as is\n    if first_non_zero is None or last_non_zero is None:\n        return input_grid\n    \n    # Reverse the segment between the first and last non-zero indices\n    output_grid = input_grid[:first_non_zero] + \\\n                  input_grid[first_non_zero:last_non_zero+1][::-1] + \\\n                  input_grid[last_non_zero+1:]\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n# Get the output grid\noutput_grid = reverse_segment(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output in the required format\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will dynamically identify the segment to reverse in any input grid and print the output in the specified format. It handles cases where there are no non-zero elements by returning the input grid unchanged."

    "The current solution correctly identifies the rule of reversing the segment between the first and last non-zero numbers in the input grid. However, to ensure robustness and handle more complex cases, consider implementing a more sophisticated approach that can dynamically identify and reverse the relevant segment in any given input grid. This could involve using symbolic computing or efficient searching techniques to generalize the solution for a wider range of inputs."
