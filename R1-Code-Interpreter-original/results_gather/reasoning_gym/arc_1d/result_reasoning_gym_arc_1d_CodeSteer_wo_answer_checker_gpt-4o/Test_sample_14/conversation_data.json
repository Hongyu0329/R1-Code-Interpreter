    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Observation: The first two non-zero numbers (4, 4) are moved to the start of the grid.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0\n   - Output: 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0\n   - Observation: The sequence of 9s is shifted two positions to the left.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0\n   - Observation: The last two non-zero numbers (2, 2) are moved two positions to the left.\n\n**Rule Derivation:**\nFrom the examples, it seems that the rule involves identifying the sequence of non-zero numbers and shifting them two positions to the left. If the sequence is at the start, it remains at the start. If it's at the end, it moves two positions left, and the rest of the grid is filled with zeros.\n\n**Applying the Rule to the Test Input:**\n- Input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n- The sequence of non-zero numbers is 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1.\n- Shift this sequence two positions to the left.\n\nLet's write the Python code to apply this rule:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero element\n    first_non_zero_index = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), None)\n    \n    # Find the last non-zero element\n    last_non_zero_index = len(input_grid) - next((i for i, x in enumerate(reversed(input_grid)) if x != 0), None) - 1\n    \n    # Extract the non-zero sequence\n    non_zero_sequence = input_grid[first_non_zero_index:last_non_zero_index + 1]\n    \n    # Create the output grid with zeros\n    output_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\n    \n    # Place the non-zero sequence two positions to the left\n    output_grid[2:2 + len(non_zero_sequence)] = non_zero_sequence\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output grid\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThe final output grid for the test input is:\n```\n<<<0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>\n```",
    "To improve the solution, we can focus on optimizing the identification and manipulation of non-zero sequences within the grid. One way to achieve this is by using a more efficient approach to find and shift the non-zero sequence. We can use a single pass to identify the sequence and then construct the output grid in a more streamlined manner. Here's how we can do it:\n\n1. **Identify the Non-Zero Sequence:**\n   - Traverse the grid once to find the start and end indices of the non-zero sequence.\n\n2. **Construct the Output Grid:**\n   - Initialize an output grid with zeros.\n   - Place the identified non-zero sequence two positions to the left in the output grid.\n\nThis approach reduces the need for multiple passes over the grid and simplifies the logic. Let's implement this optimized solution:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    n = len(input_grid)\n    start, end = None, None\n    \n    # Identify the start and end of the non-zero sequence\n    for i in range(n):\n        if input_grid[i] != 0:\n            if start is None:\n                start = i\n            end = i\n    \n    # Create the output grid with zeros\n    output_grid = [0] * n\n    \n    # If a non-zero sequence is found, shift it two positions to the left\n    if start is not None and end is not None:\n        length = end - start + 1\n        output_grid[2:2 + length] = input_grid[start:end + 1]\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output grid\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code efficiently identifies the non-zero sequence and constructs the output grid in a single pass, making it more suitable for handling larger grids or more complex patterns. The output for the test input remains the same:\n\n```\n<<<0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>\n```"

    "The current solution correctly identifies the rule and applies it to the test input. However, the complexity analysis indicates that the code primarily relies on direct mathematical operations without leveraging more advanced techniques like symbolic computing or efficient searching. To improve the code, consider implementing a more sophisticated approach that can handle a wider variety of input patterns and potentially optimize the transformation process. This could involve using data structures or algorithms that efficiently identify and manipulate sequences within the grid."
