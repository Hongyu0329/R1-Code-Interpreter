    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** `0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`\n   - **Output:** `0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of `6`s is extended to the right, replacing the `2` and the zeros that follow it.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9`\n   - **Output:** `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9`\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of `9`s is extended to the left, replacing the `2` and the zeros that precede it.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** `9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`\n   - **Output:** `9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of `9`s is extended to the right, replacing the `2` and the zeros that follow it.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can derive the following rule:\n- Identify the position of the number `2` in the input grid.\n- Determine the longest contiguous sequence of non-zero numbers either to the left or right of `2`.\n- Extend this sequence to replace the `2` and any zeros adjacent to it in the direction of the sequence.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\n**Test Input:**\n`0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0`\n\n- The number `2` is at index 9.\n- To the right of `2`, there is a sequence of `3`s.\n- Extend the sequence of `3`s to the left, replacing the `2` and the zeros that precede it.\n\n**Test Output:**\n`0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3`\n\nNow, let's output the final answer:\n\n```python\n# Test output grid\noutput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]\n\n# Print the output in the required format\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```"
