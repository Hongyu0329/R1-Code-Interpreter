    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 4 0 8 0 0 9 0 0 0 8 4 0 0 6 9 0 0 4 4 0\n   - **Output:** 4 8 9 8 4 6 9 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The non-zero numbers from the input are extracted and placed at the beginning of the output in the order they appear, followed by zeros.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 4 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 9 0 9 7 0 0 0 8 3\n   - **Output:** 4 8 9 9 7 8 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** Again, the non-zero numbers are extracted and placed at the beginning of the output, followed by zeros.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 1 1 0 0 5 0 0 0 8 0 0 9 8 0 0 0 0 8 1\n   - **Output:** 1 1 5 8 9 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The same pattern is observed: non-zero numbers are extracted and placed at the beginning, followed by zeros.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can derive the rule:\n- Extract all non-zero numbers from the input grid.\n- Place these numbers at the beginning of the output grid in the order they appear.\n- Fill the rest of the output grid with zeros to maintain the same length as the input grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n- **Test Input:** 0 8 7 0 3 4 0 3 1 0 9 0 0 0 0 9 2 7 5 4\n- **Extract Non-Zero Numbers:** 8, 7, 3, 4, 3, 1, 9, 9, 2, 7, 5, 4\n- **Output Grid:** Place these numbers at the beginning, followed by zeros.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe output grid for the test input is:\n\n```python\noutput_grid = [8, 7, 3, 4, 3, 1, 9, 9, 2, 7, 5, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the final answer in the required format.",
    "To enhance the robustness and adaptability of the solution, we can consider using more advanced techniques such as symbolic computing or efficient searching. However, given the simplicity of the current task, these techniques might not be necessary. Instead, we can focus on making the code more efficient and adaptable to potential variations.\n\n### Potential Enhancements\n\n1. **Symbolic Computing:** This involves using symbolic representations to manipulate mathematical expressions. For this task, symbolic computing might not be directly applicable since we are dealing with simple list manipulations.\n\n2. **Efficient Searching:** We can use efficient searching techniques to quickly identify non-zero elements. However, since we are already iterating through the list once to extract non-zero elements, the current approach is optimal for this specific task.\n\n3. **Generalization:** We can generalize the solution to handle different input sizes and potentially more complex rules by parameterizing the function.\n\n### Improved Solution\n\nLet's encapsulate the logic in a function that can handle different input sizes and potentially more complex rules in the future. This function will still follow the current rule but will be structured to allow easy modifications.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Extract non-zero elements\n    non_zero_elements = [num for num in input_grid if num != 0]\n    # Calculate the number of zeros needed to fill the grid\n    num_zeros = len(input_grid) - len(non_zero_elements)\n    # Create the output grid\n    output_grid = non_zero_elements + [0] * num_zeros\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 8, 7, 0, 3, 4, 0, 3, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 2, 7, 5, 4]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Function `transform_grid`:** This function takes an input grid and applies the transformation rule.\n- **List Comprehension:** Efficiently extracts non-zero elements.\n- **Output Grid Construction:** Combines non-zero elements with the necessary number of zeros to maintain the grid size.\n- **Adaptability:** The function is structured to allow easy modifications for more complex rules in the future.\n\nThis approach maintains efficiency while providing a clear structure for potential enhancements."
