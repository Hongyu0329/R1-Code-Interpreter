    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 2 2 5 9 5 9 6 3 1 8 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 8 2 6 5 1\n   - **Output:** 9 5 9 6 3 1 8 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 8 2 6 5 1 2 2 5\n   - **Observation:** The first three numbers of the input (2, 2, 5) are moved to the end of the output.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 9 6 8 6 8 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 1 4 5 5 7 6\n   - **Output:** 6 8 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 1 4 5 5 7 6 9 6 8\n   - **Observation:** The first three numbers of the input (9, 6, 8) are moved to the end of the output.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 9 8 7 1 8 3 7 1 6 7 6 7 9 8 5 8 2 2 0 0 0 5\n   - **Output:** 1 8 3 7 1 6 7 6 7 9 8 5 8 2 2 0 0 0 5 9 8 7\n   - **Observation:** The first three numbers of the input (9, 8, 7) are moved to the end of the output.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can deduce a consistent rule:\n- The first three numbers of the input grid are moved to the end of the output grid, while the rest of the numbers remain in the same order.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n- **Test Input:** 3 7 4 4 7 9 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 2 8 1\n- **Transformation:**\n  - Move the first three numbers (3, 7, 4) to the end of the sequence.\n\n- **Output:** 4 7 9 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 2 8 1 3 7 4\n\nThus, the output grid for the test input is:\n\n```plaintext\n<<<4 7 9 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 2 8 1 3 7 4>>>\n```"
