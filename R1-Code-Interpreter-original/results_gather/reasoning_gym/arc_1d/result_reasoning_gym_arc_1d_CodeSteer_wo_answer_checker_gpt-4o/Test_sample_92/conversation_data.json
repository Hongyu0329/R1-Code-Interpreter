    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the examples provided:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 1 6 3 5 0 8 0 4 6 7 6 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 9 2 0 3 0 4 0 9 8\n   - **Output:** 1 6 3 5 8 0 4 6 7 6 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 9 2 0 3 0 4 0 9 8 0\n   - **Observation:** The first zero in the input is replaced by the last non-zero number before it, which is 8. The last number in the output is a zero.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 8 0 9 0 0 9 0 0 8 0 8 0 0 7 0 6 0 7 8 0 0 2 0 5 2\n   - **Output:** 0 8 0 9 0 0 9 0 0 8 0 8 0 0 7 0 6 0 7 8 0 0 2 0 5 2 0\n   - **Observation:** The first zero is replaced by the first non-zero number after it, which is 8. The last number in the output is a zero.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 9 0 0 4 0 1 2 0 0 3 7 8 0 0 0 0 2 7 6 9 4 0 0 9 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 9 0 4 0 1 2 0 0 3 7 8 0 0 0 0 2 7 6 9 4 0 0 9 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The first zero is replaced by the first non-zero number after it, which is 4. The last number in the output is a zero.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can derive the following rule:\n- For each zero in the input, replace it with the first non-zero number that follows it in the sequence.\n- Append a zero at the end of the output sequence.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n- **Input:** 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 5 2 0 0 0 3 0 8 5 0 0 0 0 0 2 8\n\nFollowing the rule:\n- The first zero is replaced by 2 (the first non-zero number after it).\n- The second zero is replaced by 2.\n- The third zero is replaced by 2.\n- The fourth zero is replaced by 2.\n- The fifth zero is replaced by 2.\n- The sixth zero is replaced by 2.\n- The seventh zero is replaced by 5.\n- The eighth zero is replaced by 5.\n- The ninth zero is replaced by 5.\n- The tenth zero is replaced by 3.\n- The eleventh zero is replaced by 8.\n- The twelfth zero is replaced by 8.\n- The thirteenth zero is replaced by 8.\n- The fourteenth zero is replaced by 8.\n- The fifteenth zero is replaced by 2.\n- Append a zero at the end.\n\nThus, the output grid is:\n\n```python\noutput_grid = [8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 5, 5, 5, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 0]\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the final answer in the required format.",
    "To implement a more sophisticated approach that can handle complex patterns or larger datasets, we can use a queue to efficiently manage the sequence of numbers and zeros. This approach will allow us to process the input grid in a single pass, maintaining a queue of non-zero numbers to replace zeros as needed. Here's the plan:\n\n### Plan\n\n1. **Initialize a Queue:** Use a queue to keep track of non-zero numbers encountered as we iterate through the input grid.\n2. **Iterate Through the Input Grid:**\n   - If the current number is non-zero, add it to the queue.\n   - If the current number is zero, replace it with the first number in the queue (if the queue is not empty).\n3. **Append a Zero:** After processing all numbers, append a zero to the end of the output grid.\n4. **Output the Result:** Print the output grid in the specified format.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently manage the sequence of numbers and zeros, making it scalable for larger datasets.\n\nHere's the implementation in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    queue = deque()\n    output_grid = []\n\n    for num in input_grid:\n        if num != 0:\n            queue.append(num)\n            output_grid.append(num)\n        else:\n            if queue:\n                output_grid.append(queue[0])\n            else:\n                output_grid.append(0)\n\n    output_grid.append(0)  # Append a zero at the end\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 8, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code uses a queue to manage non-zero numbers and efficiently replaces zeros in the input grid. It should be robust and scalable for more complex patterns or larger datasets."

    "The current solution seems to be based on a simple pattern recognition and direct replacement strategy. However, the complexity analysis suggests that the code lacks symbolic computing and efficient searching, which might be necessary for more complex patterns or larger datasets. Consider implementing a more sophisticated approach that involves symbolic computing or efficient searching algorithms to ensure the solution is robust and scalable. This could involve using data structures like stacks or queues to manage the sequence of numbers and zeros, or implementing a more complex pattern recognition algorithm that can adapt to different input scenarios."
