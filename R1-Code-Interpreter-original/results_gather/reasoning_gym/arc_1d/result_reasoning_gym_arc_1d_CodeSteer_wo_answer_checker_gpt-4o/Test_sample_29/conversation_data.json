    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:**  0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 8 8 2 2 0 0 8 8 2 2 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of four consecutive '2's in the input (at positions 2-5 and 8-11) is transformed to '8 8 2 2' in the output.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:**  0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 8 2 0 0 0 0 8 8 2 2 2 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of four consecutive '2's in the input (at positions 8-11) is transformed to '8 8 2 2' in the output. The sequence of two '2's (at positions 2-3) is transformed to '8 2'.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:**  2 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 8 8 2 2 2 0 8 8 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of four consecutive '2's in the input (at positions 0-3 and 6-9) is transformed to '8 8 2 2' in the output.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can derive the following rule:\n- A sequence of four consecutive '2's in the input is transformed to '8 8 2 2' in the output.\n- A sequence of two consecutive '2's in the input is transformed to '8 2' in the output.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 2 2 2\n- **Transformation:**\n  - The sequence of four consecutive '2's (at positions 2-5) is transformed to '8 8 2 2'.\n  - The sequence of four consecutive '2's (at positions 6-9) is transformed to '8 8 2 2'.\n  - The sequence of three consecutive '2's (at positions 12-14) remains unchanged as there is no rule for three '2's.\n\n### Final Output\n\nThe transformed output grid is:\n- **Output:** 0 0 8 8 2 2 8 8 2 2 0 0 0 2 2\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 0 8 8 2 2 8 8 2 2 0 0 0 2 2>>>"
