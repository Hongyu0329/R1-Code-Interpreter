    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Observation: The sequence of 7s in the input starts at index 3 and ends at index 9. In the output, the sequence of 7s starts at index 1 and ends at index 7. The sequence is shifted two positions to the left.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Observation: The sequence of 7s in the input starts at index 4 and ends at index 8. In the output, the sequence of 7s starts at index 2 and ends at index 6. The sequence is shifted two positions to the left.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0\n   - Output: 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0\n   - Observation: The sequence of 4s in the input starts at index 3 and ends at index 10. In the output, the sequence of 4s starts at index 1 and ends at index 8. The sequence is shifted two positions to the left.\n\n**Rule Derivation:**\nFrom the examples, we can deduce that the rule involves shifting the sequence of non-zero numbers two positions to the left. The length of the sequence remains the same, and the numbers before and after the sequence are filled with zeros.\n\n**Test Input:**\n- Input: 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Applying the Rule:**\n- The sequence of 3s in the input starts at index 2 and ends at index 2 (a single 3).\n- Shift this sequence two positions to the left.\n- The sequence of 3s in the output will start at index 0 and end at index 0.\n\n**Output:**\n- The output grid will be: 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer in the required format:\n\n```python\noutput_grid = [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```",
    "To enhance the solution, we can implement a more dynamic algorithm that identifies the sequence of non-zero numbers, determines their start and end indices, and constructs the output grid by applying the transformation rule. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Identify the Non-Zero Sequence:**\n   - Iterate over the input grid to find the start and end indices of the non-zero sequence.\n\n2. **Construct the Output Grid:**\n   - Initialize an output grid filled with zeros.\n   - Calculate the new start and end indices for the non-zero sequence by shifting it two positions to the left.\n   - Copy the non-zero sequence from the input grid to the new positions in the output grid.\n\n3. **Handle Edge Cases:**\n   - Ensure that the shifting does not result in negative indices or indices that exceed the grid length.\n\nLet's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the start and end indices of the non-zero sequence\n    start_index = None\n    end_index = None\n    for i, value in enumerate(input_grid):\n        if value != 0:\n            if start_index is None:\n                start_index = i\n            end_index = i\n\n    # Initialize the output grid with zeros\n    output_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\n\n    # Calculate new start and end indices after shifting two positions to the left\n    if start_index is not None and end_index is not None:\n        new_start_index = max(0, start_index - 2)\n        new_end_index = new_start_index + (end_index - start_index)\n\n        # Copy the non-zero sequence to the new positions in the output grid\n        for i in range(new_start_index, new_end_index + 1):\n            output_grid[i] = input_grid[start_index + (i - new_start_index)]\n\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code dynamically identifies the non-zero sequence, calculates the new indices after shifting, and constructs the output grid accordingly. It also handles edge cases by ensuring indices remain within valid bounds."

    "The current solution correctly identifies the rule of shifting the sequence of non-zero numbers two positions to the left. However, the code generated is quite simple and does not involve symbolic computing or efficient searching. To improve the solution, consider implementing a more complex algorithm that can dynamically identify the sequence of non-zero numbers and apply the transformation rule. This could involve iterating over the input grid, detecting the start and end indices of the non-zero sequence, and constructing the output grid based on these indices. Aim to enhance the code's complexity and efficiency by incorporating these elements."
