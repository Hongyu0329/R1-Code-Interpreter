    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n### Observations:\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: 7 0 0 9 9 9 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 7 0 0 9 9 9 0 3 1 1 3 0 3 2 2 3 0 0 0\n   - Observation: A '3' is inserted after each sequence of non-zero numbers.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 0 3 7 7 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 6 6 3 0\n   - Observation: A '3' is inserted after each sequence of non-zero numbers.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 9 9 0 0 1 1 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 3 9 9 3 3 1 1 3 0 0\n   - Observation: A '3' is inserted after each sequence of non-zero numbers.\n\n### Rule:\nFrom the observations, the rule can be summarized as:\n- Insert a '3' after each sequence of non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule:\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid.\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 5 5\n\n- Identify sequences of non-zero numbers: [6, 6, 6], [6], [5, 5]\n- Insert '3' after each sequence: [6, 6, 6, 3], [6, 3], [5, 5, 3]\n\n### Final Output:\nCombine the sequences with inserted '3's and zeros:\n0 0 0 0 6 6 6 3 0 0 0 0 0 6 3 0 0 5 5 3\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to implement this rule and generate the output grid.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    output_grid = []\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(input_grid):\n        if input_grid[i] != 0:\n            # Start of a non-zero sequence\n            while i < len(input_grid) and input_grid[i] != 0:\n                output_grid.append(input_grid[i])\n                i += 1\n            # Insert '3' after the sequence\n            output_grid.append(3)\n        else:\n            # Zero element\n            output_grid.append(input_grid[i])\n            i += 1\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5]\n\n# Transform the grid\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output grid\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the transformed grid according to the identified rule."
