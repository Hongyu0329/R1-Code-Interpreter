    "To solve this problem, we need to identify a pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze each example:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 7 7\n- **Output:** 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7\n\n**Observation:** The sequence of zeros in the input is shifted to the left by 4 positions in the output.\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:** The sequence of zeros in the input is shifted to the left by 4 positions in the output.\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9\n\n**Observation:** The sequence of zeros in the input is shifted to the left by 4 positions in the output.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\nFrom the examples, we can deduce that the rule involves shifting the sequence of zeros to the left by 4 positions. The non-zero numbers at the beginning and end of the input are adjusted accordingly to maintain the same length of the grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\nBy applying the rule, we shift the sequence of zeros to the left by 4 positions:\n\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThus, the final output grid is:\n\n```python\nprint(\"<<<0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>\")\n```",
    "To create a more generalized solution, we need to develop a function that can dynamically identify the sequence of zeros and apply the transformation rule to any given input grid. The function should be able to handle different patterns and lengths of input grids.\n\n### Plan:\n1. **Identify the Sequence of Zeros:** Find the start and end indices of the sequence of zeros in the input grid.\n2. **Shift the Sequence:** Move the sequence of zeros to the left by 4 positions.\n3. **Adjust the Non-Zero Elements:** Ensure that the non-zero elements are adjusted accordingly to maintain the grid's length.\n4. **Handle Edge Cases:** Consider cases where the sequence of zeros is at the beginning or end of the grid.\n\nLet's implement this plan in a Python function:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the start and end indices of the sequence of zeros\n    zero_start = None\n    zero_end = None\n    for i in range(len(input_grid)):\n        if input_grid[i] == 0:\n            if zero_start is None:\n                zero_start = i\n            zero_end = i\n\n    # Calculate the length of the zero sequence\n    zero_length = zero_end - zero_start + 1\n\n    # Shift the zero sequence to the left by 4 positions\n    shift_amount = 4\n    new_zero_start = max(0, zero_start - shift_amount)\n    new_zero_end = new_zero_start + zero_length - 1\n\n    # Create the output grid\n    output_grid = input_grid[:]\n\n    # Move the zeros\n    for i in range(zero_length):\n        output_grid[new_zero_start + i] = 0\n\n    # Fill the remaining positions with the non-zero elements\n    non_zero_elements = [x for x in input_grid if x != 0]\n    non_zero_index = 0\n    for i in range(len(output_grid)):\n        if i < new_zero_start or i > new_zero_end:\n            output_grid[i] = non_zero_elements[non_zero_index]\n            non_zero_index += 1\n\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test the function with the given input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis function should handle various input scenarios by dynamically identifying the sequence of zeros and applying the transformation rule. It maintains the grid's length and adjusts the non-zero elements accordingly."

    "The current solution correctly identifies the pattern and applies it to the test input. However, the code generated is overly simplistic and does not demonstrate the ability to handle more complex or varied input scenarios. To improve, consider developing a more generalized solution that can dynamically identify and apply the transformation rule to any given input grid. This could involve symbolic computing or efficient searching techniques to ensure robustness and adaptability to different patterns."
