    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 4 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 4 4 4\n   - **Observation:** The number '4' in the input is extended to three '4's in the output.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 1 1 1 1 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 9 0 9 9 9 9 0 9 9 9 9 0 1 1 1 1 0 2 2 2 2 0 2\n   - **Observation:** The number '9' in the input is extended to multiple '9's in the output, and the number '2' is extended to four '2's.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0\n   - **Observation:** The number '1' is extended to four '1's in the output.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- For each non-zero number in the input grid, extend it to a sequence of the same number in the output grid. The length of the sequence seems to be determined by the context of the number in the input grid, but generally, it appears to be extended to a length of 3 or 4.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\n**Test Input:**\n0 0 0 0 7 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n- The number '7' should be extended to a sequence of '7's.\n- The sequence '1 1 1' should be extended to a longer sequence of '1's.\n\n**Predicted Output:**\n- Extend '7' to three '7's.\n- Extend '1 1 1' to four '1's.\n\nThus, the predicted output grid is:\n0 0 0 0 7 7 7 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nFinal answer:\n```\n<<<0 0 0 0 7 7 7 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>\n```",
    "To create a more sophisticated solution, we can implement a Python function that analyzes the input grid and applies the transformation rule to generate the output grid. This function will dynamically determine the length of the sequence to extend based on the context of each non-zero number in the input grid. We'll use a sliding window approach to identify sequences of non-zero numbers and extend them appropriately.\n\n### Plan\n\n1. **Identify Non-Zero Sequences:** Traverse the input grid to identify sequences of non-zero numbers.\n2. **Determine Extension Length:** For each sequence, determine the length to which it should be extended. This can be based on the examples provided, where sequences are typically extended to a length of 3 or 4.\n3. **Construct Output Grid:** Replace each identified sequence in the input grid with its extended version in the output grid.\n4. **Handle Edge Cases:** Ensure that isolated non-zero numbers and sequences at the boundaries are handled correctly.\n\nHere's the Python code implementing this approach:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    output_grid = input_grid.copy()\n    n = len(input_grid)\n    i = 0\n\n    while i < n:\n        if input_grid[i] != 0:\n            # Start of a non-zero sequence\n            start = i\n            while i < n and input_grid[i] == input_grid[start]:\n                i += 1\n            # End of the sequence\n            end = i\n            # Determine the length of the sequence to extend\n            sequence_length = end - start\n            # Extend the sequence to a length of 4\n            extension_length = max(4, sequence_length)\n            for j in range(start, min(start + extension_length, n)):\n                output_grid[j] = input_grid[start]\n        else:\n            i += 1\n\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Sliding Window:** We use a sliding window to identify sequences of non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n- **Extension Logic:** For each sequence, we extend it to a length of 4, as observed in the examples. This is a heuristic based on the provided examples.\n- **Output Construction:** The output grid is constructed by replacing each identified sequence with its extended version.\n\nThis approach is more flexible and can handle a variety of input grids by dynamically determining the extension length based on the context of each sequence.",
    "To refine the logic and ensure the output matches the expected pattern, we need to analyze the examples more closely to identify any additional patterns or rules that dictate the exact extension length for different sequences.

    "To further refine the solution, let's delve deeper into the examples to identify any additional nuances in the pattern. We need to ensure that the transformation logic accurately reflects the observed behavior in the examples.\n\n### Detailed Analysis of Examples\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 4 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 4 4 4\n   - **Observation:** The sequence '1 1 1' remains unchanged, while the single '4' is extended to '4 4 4'.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 1 1 1 1 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 9 0 9 9 9 9 0 9 9 9 9 0 1 1 1 1 0 2 2 2 2 0 2\n   - **Observation:** The single '9' is extended to multiple '9's, and the single '2' is extended to '2 2 2 2'.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence '1 1 1 1' remains unchanged, and the single '1' is extended to '1 1 1 1'.\n\n### Refined Rule\n\n- **Single Non-Zero Number:** Extend to a sequence of 3.\n- **Sequence of Non-Zero Numbers:** If the sequence is less than 4, extend it to 4.
