    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 2 0 2 0 0 0 2 2 0 2 1\n   - **Output:** 2 2 2 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Observation: The output starts with all the '2's from the input, followed by '1's, and then '0's.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 2 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 2 1\n   - **Output:** 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0\n   - Observation: The output starts with all the '2's, followed by all the '1's, and then all the '0's.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 1 2 0 2 1 0 2 0\n   - **Output:** 2 2 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Observation: The output starts with all the '2's, followed by all the '1's, and then all the '0's.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can derive the following rule:\n- Count the number of '2's, '1's, and '0's in the input.\n- Construct the output by placing all '2's first, followed by all '1's, and then all '0's.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 0 0\n- Count of '2's: 4\n- Count of '1's: 0\n- Count of '0's: 7\n\nAccording to the rule, the output should be:\n- Four '2's, followed by zero '1's, and then seven '0's.\n\n### Final Output\n\nThe output grid for the test input is:\n\n```python\noutput_grid = [2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will print the final answer in the required format.",
    "To create a more generalized and robust solution, we can implement a function that dynamically determines the transformation rule by analyzing the frequency of each unique element in the input grid. This approach will allow us to handle a wider variety of inputs and potential edge cases. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Identify Unique Elements:** Extract the unique elements from the input grid.\n2. **Count Frequencies:** Count the frequency of each unique element.\n3. **Sort Elements by Value:** Sort the unique elements in descending order to prioritize higher values first.\n4. **Construct Output:** Construct the output grid by repeating each unique element according to its frequency, following the sorted order.\n\nThis approach ensures that the transformation rule is dynamically determined based on the input grid's content, making it more adaptable to different scenarios.\n\nHere's the Python code implementing this approach:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Step 1: Count the frequency of each element\n    from collections import Counter\n    frequency = Counter(input_grid)\n    \n    # Step 2: Sort elements by value in descending order\n    sorted_elements = sorted(frequency.keys(), reverse=True)\n    \n    # Step 3: Construct the output grid\n    output_grid = []\n    for element in sorted_elements:\n        output_grid.extend([element] * frequency[element])\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\n# Get the output grid\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output in the required format\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code uses the `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each element in the input grid. It then sorts the elements in descending order and constructs the output grid by repeating each element according to its frequency. This method is more flexible and can handle a variety of input scenarios."

    "The current solution correctly identifies the rule and applies it to the test input. However, to enhance the complexity and robustness of the solution, consider implementing a more generalized approach that can handle a wider variety of inputs and potential edge cases. This could involve using symbolic computing or efficient searching techniques to dynamically determine the transformation rule. Try to solve this question with more complex and delicate code, rather than just simply displaying the answer."
