    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: 0 6 6 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 6 6 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 7 8 9 6 9 9 8 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 7 8 9 6 9 9 8 0 0\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 2 7 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 2 7 0 0 0\n\n**Observations:**\n- In each example, the sequence of non-zero numbers is shifted one position to the right.\n- The first non-zero number in the input becomes zero in the output.\n- The rest of the numbers are shifted to the right by one position.\n\n**Rule:**\n- Identify the first non-zero number in the input.\n- Set this position to zero in the output.\n- Shift all subsequent numbers to the right by one position.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n**Test Input:**\n0 0 4 3 5 4 9 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Applying the Rule:**\n- The first non-zero number is 4 at index 2.\n- Set index 2 to zero in the output.\n- Shift the sequence [4, 3, 5, 4, 9] to the right by one position.\n\n**Test Output:**\n0 0 0 4 3 5 4 9 0 0 0 0 0\n\nLet's output the final answer:\n\n```python\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 4, 3, 5, 4, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n# Find the first non-zero index\nfirst_non_zero_index = next(i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0)\n\n# Create the output grid\noutput_grid = input_grid[:]\noutput_grid[first_non_zero_index] = 0\noutput_grid[first_non_zero_index + 1:first_non_zero_index + 6] = input_grid[first_non_zero_index:first_non_zero_index + 5]\n\n# Print the output grid\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the transformed grid according to the identified rule."
