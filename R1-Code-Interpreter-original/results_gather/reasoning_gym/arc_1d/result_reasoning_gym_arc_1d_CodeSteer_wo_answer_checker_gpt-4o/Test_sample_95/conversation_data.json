    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1 Analysis:**\n   - Input: 0 1 1 5 4 7 4 5 5 7 1 6 5 9 2 7 2 2 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 0 1 1 5 4 7 4 5 5 7 1 6 5 9 2 7 2 2 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Observation: The first three non-zero numbers (1, 1, 5) are shifted to the right by three positions, and zeros are inserted at the beginning.\n\n2. **Example 2 Analysis:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Observation: The single non-zero number (3) is shifted to the right by three positions, and zeros are inserted at the beginning.\n\n3. **Example 3 Analysis:**\n   - Input: 0 0 7 5 2 9 2 5 2 5 6 9 1 5 4 7 5 7 4 1 5 3 4 4 8 4 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 7 5 2 9 2 5 2 5 6 9 1 5 4 7 5 7 4 1 5 3 4 4 8 4 0\n   - Observation: The first four non-zero numbers (7, 5, 2, 9) are shifted to the right by four positions, and zeros are inserted at the beginning.\n\n**Rule Derivation:**\nFrom the examples, it seems that the rule is to shift the first sequence of non-zero numbers to the right by the number of non-zero numbers in that sequence, and fill the beginning with zeros.\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n- Input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 2 8 9 4 2 5 4 7 7 2 9 7 0 0 0\n- The first sequence of non-zero numbers is 3, 2, 8, 9, 4, 2, 5, 4, 7, 7, 2, 9, 7 (13 numbers).\n- According to the rule, we shift these 13 numbers to the right by 13 positions.\n\n**Final Output:**\nThe output grid will be:\n\n```python\noutput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 8, 9, 4, 2, 5, 4, 7, 7, 2, 9, 7, 0, 0, 0]\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the final answer in the required format.",
    "To enhance the solution's robustness and adaptability, we can consider using more advanced techniques such as symbolic computing or efficient searching. However, given the current problem's nature, the primary task is to identify and shift the first sequence of non-zero numbers. This task is relatively straightforward and doesn't necessarily require complex symbolic computing or searching algorithms.\n\nInstead, we can focus on making the code more efficient and adaptable by ensuring it can handle variations in input size and pattern. Here's a refined approach:\n\n1. **Identify the First Sequence of Non-Zero Numbers:**\n   - Traverse the input list to find the first sequence of non-zero numbers.\n\n2. **Shift the Sequence:**\n   - Determine the length of this sequence and shift it to the right by that length.\n\n3. **Fill the Beginning with Zeros:**\n   - Ensure the beginning of the list is filled with zeros up to the point where the shifted sequence starts.\n\nHere's the improved Python code:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first sequence of non-zero numbers\n    start_index = 0\n    while start_index < len(input_grid) and input_grid[start_index] == 0:\n        start_index += 1\n    \n    end_index = start_index\n    while end_index < len(input_grid) and input_grid[end_index] != 0:\n        end_index += 1\n    \n    # Extract the sequence\n    non_zero_sequence = input_grid[start_index:end_index]\n    sequence_length = len(non_zero_sequence)\n    \n    # Create the output grid\n    output_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\n    output_grid[sequence_length:sequence_length + len(non_zero_sequence)] = non_zero_sequence\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 8, 9, 4, 2, 5, 4, 7, 7, 2, 9, 7, 0, 0, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Finding the Sequence:** We first locate the start and end indices of the first non-zero sequence.\n- **Shifting the Sequence:** We then shift this sequence to the right by its length.\n- **Efficiency:** This approach efficiently handles the input by only traversing it a couple of times, making it adaptable to different input sizes and patterns.\n\nThis code is efficient and should work well for the given problem constraints. If the problem becomes more complex, involving symbolic computation or more intricate patterns, additional techniques could be explored."
