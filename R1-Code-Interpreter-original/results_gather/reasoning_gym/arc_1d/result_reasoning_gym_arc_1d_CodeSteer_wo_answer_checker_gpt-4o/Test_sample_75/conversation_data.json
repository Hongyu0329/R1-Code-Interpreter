    "To derive a more robust and complex rule for transforming the input grid to the output grid, we can use a more algorithmic approach. This involves analyzing the patterns in the input and output grids more deeply and implementing a solution that can handle complex transformations.\n\n### Plan\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   - Analyze the input and output grids to identify any patterns or sequences.\n   - Determine if there is a specific transformation rule that applies to all examples.\n\n2. **Implement the Rule:**\n   - Use Python to implement the identified rule.\n   - Ensure the code can handle various input grids and produce the correct output.\n\n3. **Test the Rule:**\n   - Apply the rule to the test input grid to predict the output.\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n\nFrom the examples, it seems that the transformation involves:\n- Identifying a specific sequence or pattern in the input grid.\n- Rearranging the elements based on this pattern.\n\n### Implementation\n\nLet's implement a Python function to apply this transformation rule. We'll use symbolic computing to analyze the sequence and apply the transformation.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero sequence\n    first_non_zero_index = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), None)\n    \n    # If no non-zero element is found, return the input as is\n    if first_non_zero_index is None:\n        return input_grid\n    \n    # Find the last non-zero element in the sequence\n    last_non_zero_index = len(input_grid) - 1 - next((i for i, x in enumerate(reversed(input_grid)) if x != 0), None)\n    \n    # Extract the non-zero sequence\n    non_zero_sequence = input_grid[first_non_zero_index:last_non_zero_index + 1]\n    \n    # Extract the leading zeros\n    leading_zeros = input_grid[:first_non_zero_index]\n    \n    # Extract the trailing zeros\n    trailing_zeros = input_grid[last_non_zero_index + 1:]\n    \n    # Construct the output grid\n    output_grid = leading_zeros + trailing_zeros + non_zero_sequence\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [5, 5, 9, 7, 4, 1, 5, 6, 9, 2, 7, 8, 1, 7, 1, 6, 8, 9, 9, 8, 8, 5, 4, 7, 4, 9, 6, 7, 7]\n\n# Apply the transformation\ntest_output = transform_grid(test_input)\n\n# Print the output\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, test_output)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Finding the Non-Zero Sequence:** We identify the first and last non-zero elements in the grid to extract the sequence.\n- **Rearranging Elements:** We rearrange the grid by moving the non-zero sequence to the end, preserving the order of zeros.\n- **Output:** The function constructs the output grid based on the identified pattern and prints it in the required format.\n\nThis approach ensures that the transformation rule is applied accurately and can handle more complex input grids."
