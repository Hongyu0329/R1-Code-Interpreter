    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3\n   - **Output:** 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of 3s at the beginning is extended by two more 3s, and the sequence of 3s at the end is reduced by two 3s.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of 8s is shifted two positions to the right.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of 6s is shifted two positions to the right.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers.\n- Shift this sequence two positions to the right.\n- Fill the vacated positions with zeros.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\n**Test Input:**\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n- The sequence of non-zero numbers is `2`.\n- Shift this sequence two positions to the right.\n- Fill the vacated positions with zeros.\n\n**Test Output:**\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
