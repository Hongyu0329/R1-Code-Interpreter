    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the examples provided:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: `0 0 0 9 1 2 1 7 5 7 6 6 9 9 8 9 7 5 9 4 4 0 0 0 0 0`\n   - Output: `1 2 1 7 5 7 6 6 9 9 8 9 7 5 9 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9`\n\n   Observations:\n   - The sequence `9 1 2 1 7 5 7 6 6 9 9 8 9 7 5 9 4 4` from the input is shifted to the left by 3 positions in the output.\n   - The first three zeros are replaced by the first three numbers of the sequence `1 2 1`.\n   - The last zero is replaced by the first number of the sequence `9`.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 1 4 8 6 5 6 3 8 0`\n   - Output: `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 1 4 8 6 5 6 3 8 0 0 0 0 0`\n\n   Observations:\n   - The sequence `8 1 4 8 6 5 6 3 8` is shifted to the left by 12 positions.\n   - The first 12 zeros are replaced by the first 12 numbers of the sequence.\n   - The last zero remains unchanged.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: `0 0 0 0 0 9 3 2 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`\n   - Output: `0 9 3 2 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`\n\n   Observations:\n   - The sequence `9 3 2 2 1 1` is shifted to the left by 1 position.\n   - The first zero is replaced by the first number of the sequence `9`.\n\n**Rule Derivation:**\n- Identify the first non-zero sequence in the input.\n- Shift this sequence to the left, replacing the leading zeros.\n- The number of positions to shift is equal to the number of leading zeros before the sequence starts.\n- The last zero in the output is replaced by the first number of the sequence if there are any zeros left after the shift.\n\n**Test Input:**\n- Input: `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 8 9 2 8 8 6 3 9 8 2 6 4 7 7`\n\n**Applying the Rule:**\n- The sequence `1 8 9 2 8 8 6 3 9 8 2 6 4 7 7` starts after 11 zeros.\n- Shift this sequence to the left by 11 positions.\n- The first 11 zeros are replaced by the first 11 numbers of the sequence.\n- The last zero is replaced by the first number of the sequence `1`.\n\n**Final Output:**\n- Output: `1 8 9 2 8 8 6 3 9 8 2 6 4 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`\n\n```python\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 9, 2, 8, 8, 6, 3, 9, 8, 2, 6, 4, 7, 7]\n\n# Find the first non-zero sequence\nstart_index = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), len(input_grid))\nsequence = input_grid[start_index:]\n\n# Create the output grid\noutput_grid = sequence + [0] * (len(input_grid) - len(sequence))\n\n# Replace the last zero with the first number of the sequence\nif len(sequence) < len(input_grid):\n    output_grid[len(sequence)] = sequence[0]\n\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThe final output grid is:\n```\n<<<1 8 9 2 8 8 6 3 9 8 2 6 4 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>\n```",
    "Let's revise the solution to ensure it fully adheres to the derived rule. The rule states that the last zero should be replaced by the first number of the sequence only if there are any zeros left after the shift. Here's the revised plan and code:\n\n1. **Identify the Sequence:**\n   - Find the first non-zero number in the input grid to identify the start of the sequence.\n\n2. **Shift the Sequence:**\n   - Shift the identified sequence to the left, replacing the leading zeros.\n\n3. **Replace the Last Zero:**\n   - If there are any zeros left after the shift, replace the last zero with the first number of the sequence.\n\n4. **Edge Cases:**\n   - If the sequence fills the entire grid, no replacement of the last zero is needed.\n\nHere's the revised code:\n\n```python\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 9, 2, 8, 8, 6, 3, 9, 8, 2, 6, 4, 7, 7]\n\n# Find the first non-zero sequence\nstart_index = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), len(input_grid))\nsequence = input_grid[start_index:]\n\n# Calculate the number of leading zeros\nleading_zeros = start_index\n\n# Create the output grid by shifting the sequence\noutput_grid = sequence + [0] * leading_zeros\n\n# Replace the last zero with the first number of the sequence if there are zeros left\nif leading_zeros > 0:\n    output_grid[-1] = sequence[0]\n\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code correctly implements the rule by ensuring that the last zero is replaced by the first number of the sequence only if there are zeros left after the shift. The output for the test input will be:\n\n```\n<<<1 8 9 2 8 8 6 3 9 8 2 6 4 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1>>>\n```"

    "The current solution does not fully adhere to the derived rule, as the last zero should be replaced by the first number of the sequence only if there are any zeros left after the shift. Please revise the code to ensure that the last zero is replaced correctly according to the rule. Additionally, consider using more complex logic to handle edge cases and ensure the solution is robust."
