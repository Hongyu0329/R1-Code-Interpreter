    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The number '4' is moved to the position where the first '5' was, and the rest of the '5's are shifted to the right.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 7 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 2 2 2 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The number '7' is moved to the position where the first '2' was, and the rest of the '2's are shifted to the right.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 8 0 0\n   - **Output:** 8 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The number '8' is moved to the start of the list, and the rest of the '5's are shifted to the right.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can derive the following rule:\n- Identify the first non-zero number that is different from the majority of the numbers in the sequence.\n- Move this number to the position of the first occurrence of the majority number.\n- Shift the majority numbers to the right to accommodate this change.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\n**Test Input:**\n4 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n- The majority number is '3'.\n- The first non-majority number is '4'.\n- Move '4' to the position of the first '3'.\n- Shift the '3's to the right.\n\n**Test Output:**\n4 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<4 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>",
