    "To solve this problem, we need to identify a pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 6 3 9 0\n   - **Output:** 3 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 6\n   - Observation: The non-zero numbers from the input (5, 6, 3, 9) are moved to the end of the output grid, but in reverse order (3, 9, 5, 6).\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 1 5 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 1 5 3 0 0 0 0\n   - Observation: The non-zero numbers (1, 5, 3) are moved to the middle of the output grid, maintaining their order.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Observation: The non-zero numbers (8, 8) are moved to the middle of the output grid, maintaining their order.\n\nFrom these examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- Identify the non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n- Move these non-zero numbers to the middle of the output grid, maintaining their order.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n**Test Input:**\n6 3 4 2 6 9 8 1 7 0 0 0\n\n- Non-zero numbers: 6, 3, 4, 2, 6, 9, 8, 1, 7\n- Place these numbers in the middle of the output grid, maintaining their order.\n\nThe output grid will be:\n0 0 0 6 3 4 2 6 9 8 1 7\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```python\nprint(\"<<<0 0 0 6 3 4 2 6 9 8 1 7>>>\")\n```",
    "To create a more sophisticated solution, we can implement a dynamic approach that calculates the position to place non-zero numbers based on their count. This will ensure that the solution is adaptable to different input patterns and not just hardcoded for specific cases.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Identify all non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n2. Calculate the starting position for placing these non-zero numbers in the output grid. This can be done by centering the non-zero numbers in the grid.\n3. Place the non-zero numbers in the calculated positions, maintaining their order.\n4. Fill the rest of the grid with zeros.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Step 1: Extract non-zero numbers\n    non_zero_numbers = [num for num in input_grid if num != 0]\n    \n    # Step 2: Calculate the starting position for non-zero numbers\n    total_length = len(input_grid)\n    non_zero_length = len(non_zero_numbers)\n    start_position = (total_length - non_zero_length) // 2\n    \n    # Step 3: Create the output grid\n    output_grid = [0] * total_length\n    \n    # Step 4: Place non-zero numbers in the calculated positions\n    for i, num in enumerate(non_zero_numbers):\n        output_grid[start_position + i] = num\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [6, 3, 4, 2, 6, 9, 8, 1, 7, 0, 0, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output in the required format\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code dynamically calculates the starting position for the non-zero numbers, ensuring they are centered in the output grid. This approach is more adaptable and can handle a variety of input patterns effectively."

    "The current solution seems to have correctly identified the pattern and applied it to the test input. However, the complexity analysis suggests that the code is not complex enough for symbolic computing. To improve, consider implementing a more sophisticated approach that involves symbolic manipulation or efficient searching techniques. This could involve dynamically identifying the position to place non-zero numbers based on their count or other properties, rather than simply hardcoding the output. Try to solve this question with more complex and delicate code, ensuring it can handle a variety of input patterns effectively."
