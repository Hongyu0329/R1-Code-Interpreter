    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0\n\n   Observation: The sequence of 7s is shifted three positions to the right, and the zeros are adjusted accordingly.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n   Observation: The sequence of 3s is shifted three positions to the right, similar to Example 1.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n   Observation: The single 2 is shifted three positions to the right.\n\n**Rule Derivation:**\nFrom the examples, we can deduce that the rule involves shifting the non-zero numbers three positions to the right. The zeros are adjusted to fill the remaining positions.\n\n**Test Input:**\n- **Input:** 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nApplying the rule:\n- Shift the sequence of 2s three positions to the right.\n\n**Output:**\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer in the required format:\n\n```python\noutput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```",
    "To create a more generalized solution, we can implement a function that dynamically identifies the non-zero sequence in the input grid and shifts it by a specified number of positions. This function will be flexible enough to handle different input sizes and patterns. Here's the plan:\n\n1. **Identify the Non-Zero Sequence:** Traverse the input grid to find the start and end indices of the non-zero sequence.\n\n2. **Shift the Sequence:** Move the identified sequence to the right by a specified number of positions, filling the remaining positions with zeros.\n\n3. **Handle Edge Cases:** Ensure the function can handle cases where the sequence is already at the end or when the grid is entirely zeros.\n\n4. **Generalize the Shift:** Allow the function to accept a parameter for the number of positions to shift, making it adaptable to different scenarios.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef shift_sequence(input_grid, shift_by=3):\n    # Find the start and end of the non-zero sequence\n    start, end = None, None\n    for i, num in enumerate(input_grid):\n        if num != 0:\n            if start is None:\n                start = i\n            end = i\n\n    # If no non-zero sequence is found, return the original grid\n    if start is None or end is None:\n        return input_grid\n\n    # Calculate the new start position after shifting\n    new_start = start + shift_by\n\n    # Create a new grid filled with zeros\n    output_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\n\n    # Place the non-zero sequence in the new position\n    for i in range(start, end + 1):\n        if new_start < len(output_grid):\n            output_grid[new_start] = input_grid[i]\n            new_start += 1\n\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test the function with the given input\ntest_input = [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput = shift_sequence(test_input)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `shift_sequence` that identifies the non-zero sequence in the input grid and shifts it by a specified number of positions. The function is flexible and can handle different input sizes and patterns, making it more robust and adaptable."

    "The current solution correctly identifies the pattern and applies it to the test input. However, to enhance the complexity and robustness of the solution, consider implementing a more generalized approach that can handle a variety of input sizes and patterns. This could involve creating a function that dynamically identifies the non-zero sequence and shifts it by a specified number of positions, allowing for more flexible and scalable solutions. Try to incorporate symbolic computing or efficient searching techniques to improve the code's complexity and adaptability."
