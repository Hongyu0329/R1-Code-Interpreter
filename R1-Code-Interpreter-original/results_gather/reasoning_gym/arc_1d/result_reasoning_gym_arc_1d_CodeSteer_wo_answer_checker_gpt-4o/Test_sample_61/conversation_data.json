    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n### Analysis of Examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 8 8 2 2 0 8 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 8 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 8 2 2 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 8 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations:\n- The transformation seems to involve changing some of the '2's to '8's.\n- The '8's appear to be replacing '2's that are at the beginning of a sequence or surrounded by other '2's.\n- The first '2' in a sequence of '2's is often changed to '8', especially if it is preceded by a '0' or another '2'.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n- If a '2' is preceded by a '0' or another '2', it is changed to '8'.\n- If a '2' is isolated or at the end of a sequence, it remains '2'.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Test Output:** Apply the rule to transform the input grid.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    output_grid = input_grid[:]\n    for i in range(len(input_grid)):\n        if input_grid[i] == 2:\n            if i == 0 or input_grid[i-1] in [0, 2]:\n                output_grid[i] = 8\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\ntest_output = transform_grid(test_input)\n\n# Print the output in the required format\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, test_output)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThe final output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>",
    "To enhance the code's ability to generalize across different input patterns, we can implement a more sophisticated pattern recognition approach. This involves analyzing sequences of numbers and their transitions more deeply. One way to achieve this is by using a sliding window approach to examine the context around each element in the grid. This will help us identify patterns more effectively and apply transformation rules accordingly.\n\n### Plan:\n1. Use a sliding window of size 3 to examine each element and its neighbors.\n2. Identify patterns based on the current element and its neighbors.\n3. Apply transformation rules based on identified patterns.\n4. Ensure that the transformation is robust and can handle various input patterns.\n\nLet's implement this approach in the code:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    output_grid = input_grid[:]\n    n = len(input_grid)\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        # Use a sliding window to examine the current element and its neighbors\n        left = input_grid[i-1] if i > 0 else None\n        current = input_grid[i]\n        right = input_grid[i+1] if i < n-1 else None\n        \n        # Apply transformation rules based on the pattern\n        if current == 2:\n            if (left in [0, 2, None]) and (right in [2, None]):\n                output_grid[i] = 8\n            elif left == 8:\n                output_grid[i] = 8\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\ntest_output = transform_grid(test_input)\n\n# Print the output in the required format\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, test_output)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Sliding Window:** We use a window of size 3 to examine each element and its immediate neighbors (left and right).\n- **Pattern Recognition:** We check the values of the current element and its neighbors to determine if the current '2' should be transformed into an '8'.\n- **Transformation Rules:** \n  - If the current '2' is preceded by a '0', '2', or is at the start (None), and followed by a '2' or is at the end (None), it is transformed to '8'.\n  - If the current '2' is preceded by an '8', it is also transformed to '8'.\n\nThis approach should be more robust and capable of handling more complex patterns in the input grid."
