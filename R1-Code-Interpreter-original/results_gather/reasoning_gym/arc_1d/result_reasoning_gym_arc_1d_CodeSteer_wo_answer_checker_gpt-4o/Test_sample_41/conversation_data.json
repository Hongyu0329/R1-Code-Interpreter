    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: 0 0 2 9 0 1 1 9 9 0 1 0 0\n   - Output: 0 2 9 0 1 1 9 9 0 1 0 0 0\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: 2 6 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 2 6 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: 2 0 4 3 8 0 0 5 7 7 1 0 0\n   - Output: 2 4 3 8 0 0 5 7 7 1 0 0 0\n\n**Observations:**\n- In each example, the output grid is derived by removing the first zero from the input grid and appending a zero at the end.\n- The rest of the elements remain in the same order.\n\n**Rule:**\n- Find the first occurrence of zero in the input grid.\n- Remove this zero and append a zero at the end of the grid.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n**Test Input:**\n- Input: 3 8 4 0 0 0 7 7 1 0 5 0 0\n\n**Applying the Rule:**\n- The first zero is at index 3.\n- Remove this zero and append a zero at the end.\n\n**Test Output:**\n- Output: 3 8 4 0 0 7 7 1 0 5 0 0 0\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python to verify the result:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first occurrence of zero\n    first_zero_index = input_grid.index(0)\n    # Remove the first zero and append a zero at the end\n    output_grid = input_grid[:first_zero_index] + input_grid[first_zero_index+1:] + [0]\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [3, 8, 4, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 1, 0, 5, 0, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output grid\nprint(\"<<<\", \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)), \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the transformed grid according to the rule we derived."
