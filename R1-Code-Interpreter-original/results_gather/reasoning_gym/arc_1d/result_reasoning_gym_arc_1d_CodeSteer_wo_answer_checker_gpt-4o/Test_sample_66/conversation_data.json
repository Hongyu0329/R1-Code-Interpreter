    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Observation: The output is identical to the input.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 0 0 0 0\n   - Observation: The output is identical to the input.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n   - Output: 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0\n   - Observation: The sequence of 8s is shifted to the left, and the trailing 8s are replaced with 0s.\n\nFrom these observations, we can deduce the following rule:\n- If the sequence of numbers (other than 0) is at the end of the grid, the output is identical to the input.\n- If the sequence of numbers is in the middle of the grid, it is shifted to the left, and the trailing numbers are replaced with 0s.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n- **Test Input:**\n  - Input: 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0\n  - The sequence of 4s is in the middle of the grid. According to the rule, we shift the sequence of 4s to the left and replace the trailing 4s with 0s.\n\nLet's write the Python code to apply this rule and generate the output:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero number\n    first_non_zero_index = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), None)\n    \n    # If no non-zero number is found, return the input as is\n    if first_non_zero_index is None:\n        return input_grid\n    \n    # Find the last non-zero number\n    last_non_zero_index = len(input_grid) - next((i for i, x in enumerate(reversed(input_grid)) if x != 0), None) - 1\n    \n    # If the sequence is at the end, return the input as is\n    if last_non_zero_index == len(input_grid) - 1:\n        return input_grid\n    \n    # Shift the sequence to the left\n    sequence = input_grid[first_non_zero_index:last_non_zero_index + 1]\n    output_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\n    output_grid[first_non_zero_index:first_non_zero_index + len(sequence)] = sequence\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output grid\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThe output of this code will be the transformed grid according to the deduced rule.",
    "To improve the solution's robustness and scalability, we can consider using more advanced techniques for pattern recognition and transformation. However, given the simplicity of the problem, the current approach is already efficient for the provided examples. Nonetheless, let's explore how we might enhance the solution using more sophisticated methods.\n\n### Plan for Improvement\n\n1. **Pattern Recognition with Symbolic Computation:**\n   - Use symbolic computation to identify patterns in the grid. Libraries like SymPy can be used to handle symbolic expressions and transformations.\n\n2. **Efficient Search Algorithms:**\n   - Implement more efficient search algorithms to identify sequences of non-zero numbers. This can be done using techniques like sliding windows or prefix sums to quickly locate and manipulate sequences.\n\n3. **Handling Larger Grids:**\n   - Optimize the code to handle larger grids by reducing the time complexity of operations like searching and shifting sequences.\n\n### Implementation\n\nFor this task, let's focus on using a sliding window approach to efficiently identify and transform sequences in the grid. This approach will help in quickly locating sequences and applying the transformation rule.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    n = len(input_grid)\n    output_grid = [0] * n\n    \n    # Use a sliding window to find the sequence of non-zero numbers\n    start = 0\n    while start < n and input_grid[start] == 0:\n        start += 1\n    \n    if start == n:\n        return input_grid  # No non-zero numbers found\n    \n    end = start\n    while end < n and input_grid[end] != 0:\n        end += 1\n    \n    # Copy the sequence to the output grid\n    output_grid[start:end] = input_grid[start:end]\n    \n    # If the sequence is not at the end, shift it to the left\n    if end < n:\n        shift_length = end - start\n        output_grid[start:start + shift_length] = input_grid[start:end]\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output grid\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Sliding Window:** We use a sliding window to efficiently locate the start and end of the sequence of non-zero numbers.\n- **Transformation:** Once the sequence is identified, we copy it to the output grid. If the sequence is not at the end, we shift it to the left.\n- **Efficiency:** This approach reduces the need for multiple passes over the grid, making it more efficient for larger grids.\n\nThis implementation maintains the simplicity of the original solution while incorporating a more efficient search mechanism."

    "The current solution correctly identifies the rule and applies it to the test input. However, the complexity analysis indicates that the code primarily relies on direct mathematical operations without leveraging more advanced techniques like symbolic computing or efficient searching.
