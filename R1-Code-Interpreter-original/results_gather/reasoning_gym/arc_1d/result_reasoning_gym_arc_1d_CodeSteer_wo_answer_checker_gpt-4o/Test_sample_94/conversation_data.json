    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1 Analysis:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 4 3 8 8 4 3 3 8 2 5 9 3 6 4 8 7 1 7 7 5 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 3 8 8 4 3 3 8 2 5 9 3 6 4 8 7 1 7 7 5 0\n   - Observation: The first three zeros remain unchanged, and the next four numbers (4, 3, 8, 8) are shifted to the right by three positions. The rest of the numbers are shifted similarly, and the trailing zeros are added to the beginning.\n\n2. **Example 2 Analysis:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 1 2 5 3 4 4 7 7 4 7 1 4 7 4 1 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 1 2 5 3 4 4 7 7 4 7 1 4 7 4 1 0\n   - Observation: The first seven zeros remain unchanged, and the next four numbers (9, 1, 2, 5) are shifted to the right by seven positions. The rest of the numbers are shifted similarly, and the trailing zeros are added to the beginning.\n\n3. **Example 3 Analysis:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 0 3 4 3 7 1 6 2 3 8 6 8 7 7 9 5 1 6 1 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 4 3 7 1 6 2 3 8 6 8 7 7 9 5 1 6 1 0\n   - Observation: The first five zeros remain unchanged, and the next four numbers (3, 4, 3, 7) are shifted to the right by five positions. The rest of the numbers are shifted similarly, and the trailing zeros are added to the beginning.\n\n**Rule Derivation:**\nFrom the examples, we can deduce that the rule involves shifting the non-zero numbers to the right by the number of leading zeros in the input grid. The trailing zeros are then added to the beginning to maintain the grid size.\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n- Input: 0 0 8 3 3 1 9 2 5 7 5 2 9 2 8 3 2 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- Leading zeros: 2\n- Shift the non-zero numbers (8, 3, 3, 1, 9, 2, 5, 7, 5, 2, 9, 2, 8, 3, 2, 6) to the right by 2 positions.\n- Add two zeros at the beginning.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Count leading zeros\n    leading_zeros = 0\n    for num in input_grid:\n        if num == 0:\n            leading_zeros += 1\n        else:\n            break\n    \n    # Shift non-zero numbers to the right by the number of leading zeros\n    non_zero_part = input_grid[leading_zeros:]\n    transformed_grid = [0] * leading_zeros + [0] * leading_zeros + non_zero_part[:-leading_zeros]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 8, 3, 3, 1, 9, 2, 5, 7, 5, 2, 9, 2, 8, 3, 2, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output in the required format\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThe output will be the transformed grid according to the derived rule.",
    "Let's revisit the transformation logic and correct the implementation.
