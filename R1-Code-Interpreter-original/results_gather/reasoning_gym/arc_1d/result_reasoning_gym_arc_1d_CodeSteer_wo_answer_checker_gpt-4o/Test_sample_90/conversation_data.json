    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 5 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 0 0 0\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 4 4 0 4 0 4 4 4 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 4 0 4 4 0 4 4 4 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 2 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0\n\n### Observations\n\n- The first element of the output is the same as the first element of the input.\n- The second element of the output is always 0.\n- The rest of the elements in the output are the same as the corresponding elements in the input.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the observations, we can derive the following rule for transforming the input grid to the output grid:\n- The first element remains unchanged.\n- The second element is set to 0.\n- The rest of the elements remain unchanged.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n- **Test Input:** 9 9 9 0 9 0 9 9 0 9 9 9 9 0 0 0\n- **Test Output:** 9 0 9 0 9 0 9 9 0 9 9 9 9 0 0 0\n\nThus, the output grid for the test input is:\n\n```python\nprint(\"<<<9 0 9 0 9 0 9 9 0 9 9 9 9 0 0 0>>>\")\n```",
    "To create a more generalized solution that can handle variations in input size or structure, we can implement a function that dynamically identifies and applies the transformation rules. This function will analyze the input grid and apply the derived rule to produce the output grid. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:** From the examples, we know that the second element is always set to 0, while the rest of the elements remain unchanged.\n\n2. **Generalize the Rule:** Create a function that takes an input grid of any size and applies the transformation rule.\n\n3. **Implement the Function:** The function will iterate over the input grid, set the second element to 0, and keep the rest unchanged.\n\n4. **Test the Function:** Apply the function to the test input to verify its correctness.\n\nHere's the implementation in Python:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid to avoid modifying the original\n    output_grid = input_grid[:]\n    \n    # Apply the transformation rule\n    if len(output_grid) > 1:\n        output_grid[1] = 0  # Set the second element to 0\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [9, 9, 9, 0, 9, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0]\n\n# Transform the test input using the function\ntest_output = transform_grid(test_input)\n\n# Print the output in the required format\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, test_output)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `transform_grid` that applies the transformation rule to any input grid. It then tests this function with the provided test input and prints the output in the specified format. This approach is more robust and can handle variations in input size or structure."

    "The current solution correctly identifies the pattern and applies it to the test input. However, to enhance the complexity and robustness of the solution, consider implementing a more generalized approach that can handle variations in input size or structure. This could involve using symbolic computing or efficient searching techniques to dynamically identify and apply transformation rules. Try to solve this question with more complex and delicate code, rather than simply displaying the answer."
