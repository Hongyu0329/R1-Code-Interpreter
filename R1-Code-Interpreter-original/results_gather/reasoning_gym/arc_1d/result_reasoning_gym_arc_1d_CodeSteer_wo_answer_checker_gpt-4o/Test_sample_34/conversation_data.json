    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0\n\n   Observations:\n   - The sequence of 8s in the input is shifted two positions to the left in the output.\n   - The number of 8s remains the same, but the leading and trailing zeros are adjusted accordingly.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n   Observations:\n   - The sequence of 9s is shifted three positions to the left.\n   - The number of 9s remains the same, and the zeros are adjusted accordingly.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n   Observations:\n   - The sequence of 8s is shifted two positions to the left.\n   - The number of 8s remains the same, and the zeros are adjusted accordingly.\n\n**Rule Derivation:**\nFrom the examples, we can deduce that the sequence of non-zero numbers is shifted to the left by a number of positions equal to the number of leading zeros in the input grid. The sequence of non-zero numbers remains unchanged in length, and the zeros are adjusted to fill the remaining positions.\n\n**Test Input:**\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nApplying the rule:\n- The sequence of 9s should be shifted six positions to the left (equal to the number of leading zeros).\n- The output will have the same number of 9s, and the zeros will fill the remaining positions.\n\n**Output:**\n- **Output:** 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
