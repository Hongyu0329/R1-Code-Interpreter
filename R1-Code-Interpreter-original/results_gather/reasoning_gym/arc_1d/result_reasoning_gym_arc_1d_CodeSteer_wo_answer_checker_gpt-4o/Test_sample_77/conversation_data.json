    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 9 4 0 0 0 0 0 5 3 0 9 0 9 1 0 0 3\n   - **Output:** 9 4 0 0 0 0 5 3 0 9 0 9 1 0 0 3 0\n   - **Observation:** The output is the same as the input, but with an additional `0` appended at the end.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 7 3 1 7 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8\n   - **Output:** 0 0 7 3 1 7 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0\n   - **Observation:** The output is the same as the input, but with an additional `0` appended at the end.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 8 4 7 5 8 0 4 0 0 0 2 4 6 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 8 4 7 5 8 0 4 0 0 0 2 4 6 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The output is the same as the input, but with an additional `0` appended at the end.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can deduce that the rule is to take the input grid and append a `0` to the end of it to form the output grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n- **Test Input:** 0 3 7 9 4 0 5 0 0 0 0 2 0 3 2 3 0\n- **Predicted Output:** Append a `0` to the end of the input.\n\nThus, the output grid for the test input is:\n\n```python\ntest_input = [0, 3, 7, 9, 4, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 3, 2, 3, 0]\ntest_output = test_input + [0]\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, test_output)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the final answer in the required format.",
    "To explore more complex patterns or transformations, let's re-evaluate the examples to see if there might be any additional rules or transformations beyond simply appending a `0`. \n\n### Re-evaluation of Examples\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 9 4 0 0 0 0 0 5 3 0 9 0 9 1 0 0 3\n   - **Output:** 9 4 0 0 0 0 5 3 0 9 0 9 1 0 0 3 0\n   - **Observation:** The output is the same as the input, but with an additional `0` appended at the end.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 7 3 1 7 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8\n   - **Output:** 0 0 7 3 1 7 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0\n   - **Observation:** The output is the same as the input, but with an additional `0` appended at the end.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 8 4 7 5 8 0 4 0 0 0 2 4 6 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 8 4 7 5 8 0 4 0 0 0 2 4 6 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The output is the same as the input, but with an additional `0` appended at the end.\n\n### Additional Analysis\n\nUpon further inspection, the transformation appears consistent across all examples: the input grid is shifted left by one position, and a `0` is appended at the end. This suggests a more complex transformation than initially identified.\n\n### Plan\n\n1. Shift the input grid left by one position.\n2. Append a `0` to the end of the shifted grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nLet's apply this refined rule to the test input:\n\n- **Test Input:** 0 3 7 9 4 0 5 0 0 0 0 2 0 3 2 3 0\n- **Predicted Output:** Shift the input left by one position and append a `0`.\n\nHere's the Python code to achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Shift the grid left by one position\n    shifted_grid = input_grid[1:]\n    # Append a 0 to the end\n    output_grid = shifted_grid + [0]\n    return output_grid\n\ntest_input = [0, 3, 7, 9, 4, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 3, 2, 3, 0]\ntest_output = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, test_output)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the final answer in the required format, considering the more complex transformation pattern."

    "The current solution correctly identifies the pattern of appending a '0' to the input grid to form the output grid. However, the complexity analysis suggests that the code is not complex enough for symbolic computing. To improve, consider exploring more complex patterns or transformations that might exist in the data. Ensure that the code is capable of handling more intricate transformations if they are present."
