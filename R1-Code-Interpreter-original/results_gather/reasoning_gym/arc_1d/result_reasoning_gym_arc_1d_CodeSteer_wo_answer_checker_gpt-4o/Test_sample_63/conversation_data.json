    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 6 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5\n- **Output:** 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 5\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 2 0 5\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 2 2 5\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 5 0 0 0 0 7 3 0 0 0 0 0 8 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 5 7 7 7 7 7 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations:\n1. Non-zero numbers in the input are repeated in the output.\n2. The first non-zero number in the input is repeated until the next non-zero number appears.\n3. This pattern continues for each subsequent non-zero number.\n4. Zeros in the input remain zeros in the output if they are not between non-zero numbers.\n\n### Rule:\n- For each non-zero number in the input, repeat it in the output until the next non-zero number is encountered.\n- If a zero is between two non-zero numbers, it is replaced by the preceding non-zero number.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 5\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 5\n\nThus, the output for the test input is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 5>>>",

    "The current solution provided by TaskLLM is correct and effectively identifies the pattern and rule for transforming the input grid to the output grid. The reasoning process is clear and the final output matches the expected result based on the identified rule. Therefore, the TaskLLM's answer is correct."
