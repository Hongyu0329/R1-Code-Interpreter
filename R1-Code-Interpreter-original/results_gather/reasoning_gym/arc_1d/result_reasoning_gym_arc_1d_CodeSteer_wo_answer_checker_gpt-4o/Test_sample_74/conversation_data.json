    "To solve this problem, we need to identify a pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 5 0 8 8 0 4 0 8\n- **Output:** 0 0 5 0 5 5 0 5 0 5\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 6 2 6 0 7 2 0 3 0\n- **Output:** 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 0\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 9 5 7 3 3 6 0 0 0 3\n- **Output:** 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 5\n\n### Observations:\n1. In each example, the number `5` appears frequently in the output.\n2. The number `5` seems to replace any non-zero number in the input, except when the number is `0`.\n3. The position of `0` in the input remains `0` in the output.\n4. The number `5` is used as a replacement for all non-zero numbers in the input.\n\n### Rule:\n- Replace every non-zero number in the input grid with `5`.\n- Keep `0` as `0`.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 8 0 7 9 7 0\n- **Output:** Apply the rule: replace non-zero numbers with `5`.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the output for the test input.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    return [5 if x != 0 else 0 for x in input_grid]\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 7, 9, 7, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output grid\nprint(\"<<<\", \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)), \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will transform the test input grid according to the identified rule and print the output in the specified format."
