    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The '9' is shifted one position to the right.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 7 7 1 3 9 6 7 7 2 8 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 7 7 1 3 9 6 7 7 2 8 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence starting from '5' is shifted two positions to the right.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 3 3 3 7 9 3 7 9 3 7 6 9 9 4 4 5 7 4 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 3 3 3 7 9 3 7 9 3 7 6 9 9 4 4 5 7 4\n   - **Observation:** The sequence starting from '3' is shifted three positions to the right.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- Identify the first non-zero number in the input grid.\n- Shift the entire sequence starting from this number to the right by the number of leading zeros in the input grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\n**Test Input:**\n0 0 0 1 8 8 1 7 1 6 8 9 1 8 9 1 5 0 0 0 0\n\n- The first non-zero number is '1', and it is preceded by three zeros.\n- Therefore, shift the sequence starting from '1' three positions to the right.\n\n**Test Output:**\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 8 8 1 7 1 6 8 9 1 8 9 1 5 0\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 1 8 8 1 7 1 6 8 9 1 8 9 1 5 0>>>"
