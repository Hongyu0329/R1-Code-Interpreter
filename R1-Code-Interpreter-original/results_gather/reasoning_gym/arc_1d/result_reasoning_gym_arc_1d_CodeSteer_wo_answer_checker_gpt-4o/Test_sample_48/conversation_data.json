    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n### Analysis of Examples\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 1 1 1 0 2 0 0 0 1 1 0 2 2 0 2\n   - **Output:** 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 2 0 0 1 2 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 2 0 0 0 0 1 2\n   - **Output:** 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 2 1 0 0 0 2 1 2 1 0 0 1 0 2 0\n   - **Output:** 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1\n\n### Observations\n\n- The first six elements of the output are always `2`.\n- The next eight elements are always `0`.\n- The last eight elements are always `1`.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the observations, we can derive the rule:\n- The output grid is constructed by taking the first six elements as `2`, the next eight elements as `0`, and the last eight elements as `1`, regardless of the input grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nGiven the test input:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 2 1 2 2 0 0\n\nUsing the derived rule, the output will be:\n- **Output:** 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n```\n<<<2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1>>>\n```"
