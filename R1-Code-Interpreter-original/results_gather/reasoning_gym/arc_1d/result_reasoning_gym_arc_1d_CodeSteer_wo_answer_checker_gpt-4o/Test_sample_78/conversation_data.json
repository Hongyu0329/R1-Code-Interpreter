    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 1 7 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 9 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0\n   - Observation: The sequence of 8s is extended to replace the 1 and 7 in the middle.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 0 3 4 4 4 4 6 4 4 4 4 4 4 3 4 4 4 4 4 5 4 4 4 4 5\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n   - Observation: The sequence of 4s is extended to replace the 3, 6, and 5.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: 5 5 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Observation: The sequence of 5s is extended to replace the 7 and 1.\n\n**Rule Derivation:**\nThe rule seems to be that the most frequent non-zero number in the input grid is extended to replace other numbers, except for the trailing zeros. The zeros at the beginning and end remain unchanged.\n\n**Applying the Rule to the Test Input:**\n- Input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 9 2 2 4 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 9 1 1 1 1 0 0\n- The most frequent non-zero number is 1.\n- Replace all non-zero numbers with 1, except for the leading and trailing zeros.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Count the frequency of each number, ignoring zeros\n    from collections import Counter\n    counter = Counter(input_grid)\n    counter.pop(0, None)  # Remove zero from the count\n\n    # Find the most frequent non-zero number\n    most_frequent = counter.most_common(1)[0][0]\n\n    # Transform the grid\n    output_grid = [most_frequent if x != 0 else 0 for x in input_grid]\n\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 9, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output grid\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThe output will be:\n\n```\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0>>>\n```",
    "To enhance the efficiency and robustness of the solution, we can consider using more advanced data structures or algorithms. However, given the nature of the problem, the current approach using Python's `collections.Counter` is already quite efficient for counting elements in a list. The complexity of counting elements is \\(O(n)\\), where \\(n\\) is the length of the list, which is optimal for this task.\n\nHowever, we can explore using a more efficient way to determine the most frequent number by leveraging the properties of the input grid. For instance, if the input grid is very large and we expect a lot of repeated elements, we could use a more memory-efficient approach or parallel processing. But for the current problem size, the existing approach is quite efficient.\n\nLet's consider a slightly optimized approach by using a single pass to determine the most frequent number and transform the grid simultaneously. This reduces the number of passes over the data from two to one.\n\nHere's how we can do it:\n\n1. Traverse the list once to count the frequency of each non-zero number and simultaneously build the output list.\n2. Use a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of each number.\n3. Determine the most frequent number on-the-fly and update the output list accordingly.\n\nHere's the optimized code:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid_optimized(input_grid):\n    frequency = {}\n    most_frequent = None\n    max_count = 0\n    output_grid = []\n\n    for num in input_grid:\n        if num != 0:\n            # Update frequency count\n            if num in frequency:\n                frequency[num] += 1\n            else:\n                frequency[num] = 1\n\n            # Check if this is the new most frequent number\n            if frequency[num] > max_count:\n                most_frequent = num\n                max_count = frequency[num]\n\n    # Build the output grid using the most frequent number\n    for num in input_grid:\n        if num == 0:\n            output_grid.append(0)\n        else:\n            output_grid.append(most_frequent)\n\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 9, 2, 2, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid_optimized(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output grid\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code still runs in \\(O(n)\\) time complexity but reduces the number of passes over the data, which can be beneficial for very large datasets. The use of a dictionary for counting ensures that the solution remains efficient and robust."
