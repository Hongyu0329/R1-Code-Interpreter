    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 3 7 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 3 7 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence \"9 3 7\" is moved from the 9th position to the 7th position.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 6 6 9 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 1 8\n   - **Output:** 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 1 8 6 6 9\n   - **Observation:** The sequence \"3 1 8\" is moved from the 13th position to the 9th position, and the sequence \"6 6 9 2\" is moved to the end.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 7 7 7 7 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence \"7 7 7 7 3 2\" is moved from the 4th position to the start.\n\nFrom these examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- Identify the first non-zero sequence in the input grid.\n- Move this sequence to the start of the output grid.\n- Shift the remaining elements to the right, maintaining their order.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n**Test Input:**\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0\n\n- The first non-zero sequence is \"7\" at the 12th position.\n- Move \"7\" to the start of the output grid.\n- Shift the remaining elements to the right.\n\n**Test Output:**\n7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>",

    "The current solution provided by TaskLLM is correct in identifying the rule and applying it to the test input. The rule involves identifying the first non-zero sequence and moving it to the start of the output grid, which has been correctly applied. Therefore, the TaskLLM's answer is accurate and does not require further improvement.",
    "The TaskLLM's response does not address the task at hand. Please focus on identifying the transformation rule from the given examples and apply it to the test input. Ensure that your solution involves a clear explanation of the rule and its application.
