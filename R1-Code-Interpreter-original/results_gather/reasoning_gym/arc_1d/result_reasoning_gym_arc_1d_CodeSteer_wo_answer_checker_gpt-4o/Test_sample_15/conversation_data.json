    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 2 0 7 7 7 7 7 7\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 2 7 7 7 7 7 7 0\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: 2 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n   - Output: 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: 8 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 8 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observations:**\n- The first element of the output is the same as the first element of the input.\n- The last element of the output is always 0.\n- The elements in between the first and last positions are filled with the first non-zero number found in the input after the first element.\n\n**Rule Derivation:**\n1. The first element of the output is the same as the first element of the input.\n2. The last element of the output is always 0.\n3. For the elements between the first and last positions, find the first non-zero number in the input (after the first element) and fill these positions with that number.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n- **Test Input:**\n  - Input: 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 2\n\n**Applying the Rule:**\n1. The first element of the output is 9.\n2. The last element of the output is 0.\n3. The first non-zero number after the first element is 9 (since all initial elements are 9), so fill the middle positions with 9.\n\nThus, the output grid for the test input is:\n\n```python\noutput_grid = [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0]\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the final output grid in the required format.",
    "To enhance the solution for robustness and scalability, we can consider using a more structured approach to identify patterns and apply transformations. However, given the simplicity of the problem, using advanced pattern recognition algorithms or symbolic computation libraries might be overkill. Instead, we can focus on making the code more efficient and clear, ensuring it can handle larger inputs effectively.\n\nHere's a refined approach using Python, which maintains clarity and efficiency:\n\n1. **Identify the first non-zero element after the first element.**\n2. **Construct the output list based on the identified pattern.**\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # The first element of the output is the same as the first element of the input\n    first_element = input_grid[0]\n    \n    # The last element of the output is always 0\n    last_element = 0\n    \n    # Find the first non-zero element after the first element\n    fill_value = next((x for x in input_grid[1:] if x != 0), 0)\n    \n    # Construct the output grid\n    output_grid = [first_element] + [fill_value] * (len(input_grid) - 2) + [last_element]\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 2]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output in the required format\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Efficiency:** The use of `next()` with a generator expression efficiently finds the first non-zero element after the first element, which is a linear operation.\n- **Clarity:** The code is structured to clearly separate the steps of identifying the pattern and constructing the output.\n- **Scalability:** This approach can handle larger input grids efficiently due to its linear complexity.\n\nThis solution is robust for the given problem and can be easily adapted for more complex scenarios if needed."
