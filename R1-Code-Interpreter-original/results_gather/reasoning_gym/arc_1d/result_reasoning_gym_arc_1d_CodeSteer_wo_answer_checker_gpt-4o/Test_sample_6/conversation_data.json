    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 2 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 7 7 7 7 7 0 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations\n\n- The first five numbers in the input are always repeated in the output.\n- The zeros in the input are replaced by the repeated number in certain positions in the output.\n- Specifically, the zeros in the input are replaced by the repeated number in the positions where the input has zeros but the output has the repeated number.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can derive the following rule:\n- The first five numbers remain unchanged.\n- The zeros in the input are replaced by the repeated number in the positions where the output has the repeated number.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nGiven the test input:\n- **Input:** 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nWe apply the rule:\n- The first five numbers remain unchanged: 1 1 1 1 1\n- The zeros are replaced by 1 in the positions where the output has 1.\n\nThus, the output grid is:\n- **Output:** 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
