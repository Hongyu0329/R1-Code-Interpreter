    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1 Analysis:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0\n   - Observation: The number '4' in the input is extended to the right until the next non-zero number or the end of the grid.\n\n2. **Example 2 Analysis:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Observation: The first '4' is extended to the right until the next non-zero number or the end of the grid.\n\n3. **Example 3 Analysis:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Observation: The number '2' is extended to the right until the next non-zero number or the end of the grid.\n\n**Rule Derivation:**\n- For each non-zero number in the input grid, extend it to the right until the next non-zero number or the end of the grid.\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n- Input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 9\n- Apply the rule: The first '9' should be extended to the right until the next '9'.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input to get the output.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    output_grid = input_grid[:]\n    n = len(input_grid)\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        if input_grid[i] != 0:\n            j = i + 1\n            while j < n and input_grid[j] == 0:\n                output_grid[j] = input_grid[i]\n                j += 1\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output in the required format\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThe output for the test input will be:\n```\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9>>>\n```"
