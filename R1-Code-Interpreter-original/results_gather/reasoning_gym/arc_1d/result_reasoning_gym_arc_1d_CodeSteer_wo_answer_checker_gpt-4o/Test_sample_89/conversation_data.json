    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0\n   - **Output:** 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Transformation:** The sequence of 3s is shifted to the left, and the trailing 0s are moved to the right.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0\n   - **Output:** 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Transformation:** The sequence of 3s is shifted to the left, and the trailing 0s are moved to the right.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Transformation:** The sequence of 3s is shifted to the left, and the trailing 0s are moved to the right.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers (e.g., 3s in the examples).\n- Shift this sequence to the leftmost position possible.\n- Fill the remaining positions with 0s.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\n**Test Input:**\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\n\n**Transformation:**\n- Identify the sequence of 1s.\n- Shift the sequence of 1s to the leftmost position.\n- Fill the remaining positions with 0s.\n\nLet's implement this transformation in Python:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Extract the non-zero sequence\n    non_zero_sequence = [num for num in input_grid if num != 0]\n    # Calculate the number of zeros to append\n    num_zeros = len(input_grid) - len(non_zero_sequence)\n    # Create the output grid\n    output_grid = non_zero_sequence + [0] * num_zeros\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output in the required format\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThe final output for the test input will be:\n\n```\n<<<1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0>>>\n```"
