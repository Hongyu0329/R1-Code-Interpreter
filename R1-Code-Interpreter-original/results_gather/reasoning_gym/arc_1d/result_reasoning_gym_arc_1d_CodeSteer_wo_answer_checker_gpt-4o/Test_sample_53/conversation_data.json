    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 6\n   - Output: 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 6 6 6\n   - Observation: The sequence of 6s is extended by two additional 6s at the end.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n   - Output: 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n   - Observation: The sequence remains unchanged.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n   - Output: 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n   - Observation: The sequence of 6s at the beginning is reduced by two, and the sequence of 6s at the end is extended by two.\n\n**Rule Derivation:**\n- The rule seems to involve shifting the sequence of numbers towards the end of the grid by two positions, while maintaining the same numbers. If the sequence is already at the end, it remains unchanged.\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n- Input: 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- Applying the rule: Shift the sequence of 7s two positions to the right.\n\n**Output:**\n- The sequence of 7s will be shifted two positions to the right, resulting in the following output:\n\n```python\noutput = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the final output grid.",
    "To derive a more robust rule, let's analyze the input-output relationship more deeply. We need to identify a pattern or transformation that consistently applies across the examples. Let's break down the examples again:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 6\n   - Output: 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 6 6 6\n   - Observation: The sequence of 6s is extended by two additional 6s at the end.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n   - Output: 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n   - Observation: The sequence remains unchanged.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n   - Output: 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n   - Observation: The sequence of 6s at the beginning is reduced by two, and the sequence of 6s at the end is extended by two.\n\n**Deeper Analysis:**\n- The transformation seems to involve shifting the sequence of numbers towards the end of the grid by two positions, while maintaining the same numbers. If the sequence is already at the end, it remains unchanged.\n- The rule might involve identifying the longest contiguous sequence of non-zero numbers and shifting it towards the end of the grid by two positions.\n\n**Plan:**\n1. Identify the longest contiguous sequence of non-zero numbers.\n2. Shift this sequence two positions to the right.\n3. Fill the remaining positions with zeros or the original numbers as needed.\n\nLet's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    n = len(input_grid)\n    # Find the longest contiguous sequence of non-zero numbers\n    max_start, max_end = 0, 0\n    current_start = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if input_grid[i] != 0:\n            if i == 0 or input_grid[i-1] == 0:\n                current_start = i\n            if i == n-1 or input_grid[i+1] == 0:\n                if i - current_start > max_end - max_start:\n                    max_start, max_end = current_start, i\n\n    # Shift the sequence two positions to the right\n    output_grid = [0] * n\n    shift = 2\n    for i in range(max_start, max_end + 1):\n        if i + shift < n:\n            output_grid[i + shift] = input_grid[i]\n        else:\n            output_grid[i] = input_grid[i]\n\n    # Fill the remaining positions with the original numbers\n    for i in range(n):\n        if output_grid[i] == 0:\n            output_grid[i] = input_grid[i]\n\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code should provide a more generalized solution that can handle different input patterns by identifying and shifting the longest contiguous sequence of non-zero numbers."

    "The current solution involves a simple shift operation, which may not fully capture the complexity of the task. Consider using more advanced techniques such as symbolic computing or efficient searching algorithms to derive a more robust rule that can handle a wider range of input patterns.
