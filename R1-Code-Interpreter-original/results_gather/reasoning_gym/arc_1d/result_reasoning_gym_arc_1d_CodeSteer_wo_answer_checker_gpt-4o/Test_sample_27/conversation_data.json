    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 1 1 5 3 1 0 3 5 9 8 7 8\n   - **Output:** 1 5 3 1 0 3 5 9 8 7 8 1\n   - **Observation:** The first element (1) is moved to the end of the list.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 9 3 6 4 1 2 5 6 1 6 2 2\n   - **Output:** 3 6 4 1 2 5 6 1 6 2 2 9\n   - **Observation:** The first element (9) is moved to the end of the list.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 8 2 1 7 3 6 2 2 5 5 2 5\n   - **Output:** 2 1 7 3 6 2 2 5 5 2 5 8\n   - **Observation:** The first element (8) is moved to the end of the list.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can deduce a simple rule: **Move the first element of the input grid to the end of the output grid.** The rest of the elements remain in the same order.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n- **Test Input:** 7 9 6 4 0 0 0 8 7 1 3 5\n- **Rule Application:** Move the first element (7) to the end of the list.\n\n### Test Output\n\nFollowing the rule, the output for the test input will be:\n\n- **Output:** 9 6 4 0 0 0 8 7 1 3 5 7\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to implement this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Move the first element to the end of the list\n    output_grid = input_grid[1:] + input_grid[:1]\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [7, 9, 6, 4, 0, 0, 0, 8, 7, 1, 3, 5]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output in the required format\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the transformed grid according to the rule we derived."
