    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: 0 1 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 1 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0\n   - Observation: The input and output are identical.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 1 0 4 4 4 4 0\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 1 4 4 4 4 0 0\n   - Observation: The number '4' is shifted one position to the left, and the '1' is retained in its position. The trailing '0' is moved to the end.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: 0 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n   - Output: 0 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n   - Observation: The input and output are identical.\n\nFrom these examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- If the sequence of numbers after the first non-zero number is the same, the output remains the same as the input.\n- If there is a '0' between non-zero numbers, the sequence of non-zero numbers after the first non-zero number is shifted left, and the trailing '0' is moved to the end.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n**Test Input:**\n- Input: 8 8 8 8 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n\nApplying the rule:\n- The sequence of numbers after the first non-zero number (8) is not the same due to the presence of '0's.\n- Shift the sequence of non-zero numbers (8 8 8 8 1) to the left, and move the trailing '0's to the end.\n\n**Test Output:**\n- Output: 8 8 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThus, the final output grid is:\n\n```python\noutput_grid = [8, 8, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```",
    "To derive a more generalized and robust solution, let's analyze the examples again to identify any underlying patterns or rules that could be applied more broadly. We will use a symbolic approach to understand the transformation.\n\n### Observations:\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: 0 1 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 1 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0\n   - The sequence remains unchanged.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 1 0 4 4 4 4 0\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 1 4 4 4 4 0 0\n   - The '1' is followed by a '0', and then a sequence of '4's. The '4's are shifted left, and the trailing '0' is moved to the end.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: 0 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n   - Output: 0 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n   - The sequence remains unchanged.\n\n### General Rule:\n- Identify the first non-zero number.\n- If there is a '0' between non-zero numbers, shift the sequence of non-zero numbers to the left, and move the trailing '0's to the end.\n- If the sequence of numbers after the first non-zero number is the same, the output remains the same as the input.\n\n### Plan:\n1. Identify the first non-zero number.\n2. Check for any '0's between non-zero numbers.\n3. If '0's are present, shift the sequence of non-zero numbers to the left.\n4. Move the trailing '0's to the end.\n\nLet's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero number\n    first_non_zero_index = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), None)\n    \n    if first_non_zero_index is None:\n        return input_grid  # If all are zeros, return as is\n    \n    # Extract the sequence after the first non-zero number\n    sequence = input_grid[first_non_zero_index:]\n    \n    # Check if there are zeros in the sequence\n    if 0 in sequence:\n        # Remove zeros and append them to the end\n        non_zero_sequence = [x for x in sequence if x != 0]\n        zero_count = len(sequence) - len(non_zero_sequence)\n        transformed_sequence = non_zero_sequence + [0] * zero_count\n        return input_grid[:first_non_zero_index] + transformed_sequence\n    else:\n        return input_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code should handle a wider range of inputs by identifying and shifting sequences of non-zero numbers while maintaining the position of zeros appropriately."

    "The current solution seems to be based on a simple observation and direct manipulation of the input grid. To improve the solution, consider implementing a more complex and symbolic approach that can generalize better to different patterns. Try to identify any underlying patterns or rules that could be applied more broadly, and use efficient searching or symbolic computing techniques to derive the output grid. This will help ensure the solution is robust and adaptable to a wider range of inputs."
