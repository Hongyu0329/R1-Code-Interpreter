    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of 7s is shifted left by 3 positions.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of 8s is shifted left by 3 positions.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of 4s is shifted left by 3 positions.\n\n**Rule Derivation:**\nFrom the examples, we can deduce that the rule is to shift the sequence of non-zero numbers left by 3 positions. The length of the sequence and the number itself remain unchanged.\n\n**Test Input:**\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Applying the Rule:**\n- Shift the sequence of 8s left by 3 positions.\n\n**Output:**\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
