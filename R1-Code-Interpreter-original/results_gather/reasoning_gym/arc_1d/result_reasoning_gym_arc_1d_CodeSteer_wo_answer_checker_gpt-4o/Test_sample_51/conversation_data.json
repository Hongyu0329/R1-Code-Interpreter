    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 8 8 8 8 2 2 2 2 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0\n\n   Observations:\n   - The first four '2's in the input are transformed to '8's in the output.\n   - The next four '2's remain unchanged.\n   - The '0' remains unchanged.\n   - The next four '2's are transformed to '8's.\n   - The remaining '2's and '0's remain unchanged.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 8 2 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n   Observations:\n   - The first '2' is transformed to '8', the second '2' remains unchanged.\n   - The '0's remain unchanged.\n   - The next four '2's are transformed to '8's.\n   - The next '2' remains unchanged.\n   - The remaining '2's and '0's remain unchanged.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 8 2 0 8 8 8 8 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n   Observations:\n   - The first '0' remains unchanged.\n   - The first '2' is transformed to '8', the second '2' remains unchanged.\n   - The '0' remains unchanged.\n   - The next four '2's are transformed to '8's.\n   - The next '2' remains unchanged.\n   - The remaining '2's and '0's remain unchanged.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can derive the following rule:\n- Transform the first occurrence of a sequence of '2's to '8's until a '0' is encountered or the sequence ends.\n- If a '0' is encountered, stop transforming and leave the rest unchanged.\n- Continue this pattern for each sequence of '2's separated by '0's.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n- **Input:** 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 0\n\nFollowing the rule:\n- The first '0' remains unchanged.\n- The first '2' is transformed to '8', the next '2's are transformed to '8's until the first '0' is encountered.\n- The '0's remain unchanged.\n- The next sequence of '2's is transformed to '8's until the next '0' is encountered.\n\nThus, the output grid is:\n\n```python\nprint(\"<<<8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0>>>\")\n```",
    "To enhance the solution and make it more robust, we can implement a more dynamic approach that can handle a wider range of input patterns. This involves identifying sequences of numbers and applying transformations based on observed patterns. We can use a state machine approach to track sequences and apply transformations accordingly.\n\n### Plan\n\n1. **Initialize State:** Start with a state that tracks whether we are in a sequence of '2's or not.\n2. **Iterate Over Input:** Go through each number in the input grid.\n3. **State Transitions:**\n   - If we encounter a '2' and are not in a sequence, start a new sequence and transform the '2' to '8'.\n   - If we are in a sequence and encounter another '2', continue transforming to '8'.\n   - If we encounter a '0', end the current sequence and leave the '0' unchanged.\n   - If we encounter a '2' after a '0', start a new sequence.\n4. **Output the Result:** Construct the output grid based on the transformations.\n\nHere's the enhanced Python code implementing this approach:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    output_grid = []\n    in_sequence = False\n\n    for num in input_grid:\n        if num == 2:\n            if not in_sequence:\n                in_sequence = True\n            output_grid.append(8)\n        elif num == 0:\n            in_sequence = False\n            output_grid.append(0)\n        else:\n            output_grid.append(num)\n\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **State Management:** We use a boolean `in_sequence` to track whether we are currently transforming a sequence of '2's.\n- **Transformation Logic:** When a '2' is encountered, we check if we are in a sequence. If not, we start a new sequence and transform the '2' to '8'. If we are already in a sequence, we continue transforming '2's to '8's.\n- **Handling '0's:** When a '0' is encountered, we end the current sequence and leave the '0' unchanged.\n- **Output Construction:** The transformed numbers are collected in `output_grid`, which is then printed in the required format.\n\nThis approach is more flexible and can handle a variety of input patterns by dynamically identifying and transforming sequences of numbers."

    "The current solution seems to be correct as it matches the expected output based on the derived rule. However, to ensure robustness and handle more complex scenarios, consider implementing a more sophisticated approach that can dynamically identify and transform sequences of numbers based on the observed patterns. This could involve using symbolic computing or efficient searching techniques to generalize the rule application. Try to enhance the code by incorporating these elements to handle a wider range of input patterns."
