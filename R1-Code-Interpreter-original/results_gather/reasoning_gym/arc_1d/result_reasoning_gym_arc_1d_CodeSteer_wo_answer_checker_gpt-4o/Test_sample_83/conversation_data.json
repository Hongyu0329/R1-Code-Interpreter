    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 2 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n   - **Output:** 2 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The first four numbers in the output seem to be derived from the non-zero numbers in the input. The '2' from the input is repeated twice, followed by the '1' repeated twice.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2 2\n   - **Output:** 2 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The output starts with three '2's followed by one '1'. This corresponds to the three '2's and one '1' in the input.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 2 1 0 2 0 0 1 2 1 0 2 2 2\n   - **Output:** 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The output starts with six '2's followed by three '1's. This matches the six '2's and three '1's in the input.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- Count the number of '2's and '1's in the input grid.\n- The output grid starts with all the '2's followed by all the '1's, and the rest are '0's.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n- **Test Input:** 2 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2 1 1\n- **Count of '2's:** 3\n- **Count of '1's:** 4\n\nAccording to the rule, the output should start with three '2's followed by four '1's, and the rest should be '0's.\n\n### Final Output\n\nThe output grid for the test input is:\n\n```python\noutput_grid = [2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the final answer in the required format.",
    "To create a more generalized and robust solution, we can implement a function that dynamically identifies patterns and transformations in the input grid. This function will be able to handle larger grids and different patterns by analyzing the frequency of each non-zero number and constructing the output grid accordingly.\n\n### Plan\n\n1. **Identify Unique Non-Zero Elements:** Extract all unique non-zero elements from the input grid.\n2. **Count Occurrences:** Count the occurrences of each unique non-zero element.\n3. **Sort and Construct Output:** Sort the unique elements based on their value (or any other criteria if needed) and construct the output grid by placing these elements in order of their frequency.\n4. **Fill Remaining with Zeros:** Fill the rest of the grid with zeros to maintain the original grid size.\n\nThis approach will ensure that the solution is adaptable to different grid sizes and configurations.\n\n### Implementation\n\nLet's implement this plan in a Python function:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    from collections import Counter\n    \n    # Count occurrences of each number in the input grid\n    count = Counter(input_grid)\n    \n    # Remove zero from the count as we don't need to transform zeros\n    if 0 in count:\n        del count[0]\n    \n    # Sort the numbers based on their value (or any other criteria if needed)\n    sorted_numbers = sorted(count.keys())\n    \n    # Construct the output grid\n    output_grid = []\n    for number in sorted_numbers:\n        output_grid.extend([number] * count[number])\n    \n    # Fill the rest with zeros to maintain the original grid size\n    output_grid.extend([0] * (len(input_grid) - len(output_grid)))\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test the function with the given input\ntest_input = [2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(\"<<<\" + \" \".join(map(str, output_grid)) + \">>>\")\n```\n\nThis function will dynamically handle different grid sizes and configurations by counting and sorting the non-zero elements, ensuring the solution is scalable and versatile."

    "The current solution correctly identifies the rule and applies it to the test input. However, to enhance the complexity and robustness of the solution, consider implementing a more generalized approach that can handle larger grids or different patterns.

This could involve creating a function that can adapt to various input sizes and configurations, ensuring the solution is scalable and versatile."
