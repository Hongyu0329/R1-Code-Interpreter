    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n- **Output:** 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The input grid is a 5x5 matrix.\n- The first row of the input grid is: 3 0 0 0 0\n- The first row of the output grid is: 3 3 3 3 0\n- The first four elements of the first row in the output are filled with the first element of the input row.\n- The last element of the first row in the output is the same as the last element of the input row.\n- The rest of the grid remains unchanged.\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5\n- **Output:** 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The first row of the input grid is: 5 5 0 0 0\n- The first row of the output grid is: 5 5 5 5 5\n- The first five elements of the first row in the output are filled with the first element of the input row.\n- The rest of the grid remains unchanged.\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\n- **Output:** 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The first row of the input grid is: 1 1 1 1 1\n- The first row of the output grid is: 0 0 1 1 1\n- The first two elements of the first row in the output are filled with 0.\n- The next three elements of the first row in the output are filled with the first element of the input row.\n- The rest of the grid remains unchanged.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- The first row of the output grid is modified based on the first row of the input grid.\n- The first few elements of the first row in the output are filled with the first element of the input row, and the number of elements filled corresponds to the number of non-zero elements in the first row of the input.\n- The rest of the grid remains unchanged.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The first row of the input grid is: 2 2 2 2 0\n- The first row of the output grid should be: 2 2 2 2 2\n- The rest of the grid remains unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2>>>"
