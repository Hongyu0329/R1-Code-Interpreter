    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:**  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 1 1 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 1 1 0 0 0\n\nObservations:\n- The number '2' in the input grid is expanded to fill a 3x3 block in the output grid.\n- The '1's remain unchanged in their positions.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:**  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 5 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0\n\nObservations:\n- The number '5' in the input grid is expanded to fill a 3x3 block in the output grid.\n- The '1's remain unchanged in their positions.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:**  0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 8 8 8 8 0 8 8 8\n\nObservations:\n- The number '8' in the input grid is expanded to fill a 3x3 block in the output grid.\n- The '1's remain unchanged in their positions.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\nFrom the examples, we can derive the following rule:\n- Identify the non-zero number (other than '1') in the input grid.\n- Expand this number to fill a 3x3 block in the output grid, centered around its original position.\n- Keep the '1's in their original positions.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 0 2 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSteps:\n1. Identify the non-zero number (other than '1'), which is '2'.\n2. Expand '2' to fill a 3x3 block in the output grid.\n3. Keep the '1's in their original positions.\n\n### Test Output:\n- The '2' at position 1 in the input grid will expand to fill positions 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, and 14 in the output grid.\n- The '1's at positions 3 and 4 in the input grid remain unchanged in the output grid.\n\nThus, the output grid is:\n<<<2 2 2 1 1 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
