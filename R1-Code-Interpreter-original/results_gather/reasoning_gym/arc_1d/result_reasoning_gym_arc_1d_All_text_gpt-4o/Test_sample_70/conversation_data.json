    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:** \n- The sequence of 9s in the input starts at position 6 and ends at position 16.\n- In the output, the sequence of 9s starts at position 8 and ends at position 18.\n- The sequence of 9s is shifted two positions to the right.\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n- **Output:** 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence of 3s in the input starts at position 0 and ends at position 14, then resumes at position 21 and ends at position 28.\n- In the output, the sequence of 3s starts at position 0 and ends at position 17, then resumes at position 24 and ends at position 28.\n- The sequence of 3s is shifted three positions to the right in the first part and three positions to the right in the second part.\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence of 7s in the input starts at position 9 and ends at position 21.\n- In the output, the sequence of 7s starts at position 12 and ends at position 24.\n- The sequence of 7s is shifted three positions to the right.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\nFrom the examples, we can deduce that the rule involves shifting the sequence of non-zero numbers to the right by a certain number of positions. The number of positions seems to be determined by the length of the sequence of non-zero numbers.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The sequence of 1s in the input starts at position 0 and ends at position 7, then resumes at position 18 and ends at position 28.\n- The length of the first sequence of 1s is 8, and the length of the second sequence is 11.\n\n**Output Prediction:**\n- Shift the first sequence of 1s (length 8) three positions to the right: it will start at position 3 and end at position 10.\n- Shift the second sequence of 1s (length 11) three positions to the right: it will start at position 21 and end at position 28.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe predicted output grid is:\n<<<1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1>>>"
