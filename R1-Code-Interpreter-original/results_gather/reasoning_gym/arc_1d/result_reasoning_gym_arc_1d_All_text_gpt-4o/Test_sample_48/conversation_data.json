    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 1 1 1 0 2 0 0 0 1 1 0 2 2 0 2\n- **Output:** 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 2 0 0 1 2 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 2 0 0 0 0 1 2\n- **Output:** 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 2 1 0 0 0 2 1 2 1 0 0 1 0 2 0\n- **Output:** 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1\n\n### Observations:\n1. The first six elements of the output are always `2`.\n2. The next nine elements of the output are always `0`.\n3. The last seven elements of the output are always `1`.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n- The output grid is constructed by:\n  - Placing six `2`s at the beginning.\n  - Placing nine `0`s following the `2`s.\n  - Placing seven `1`s at the end.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 2 1 2 2 0 0\n- **Predicted Output:** According to the derived rule, the output should be:\n  - Six `2`s: 2 2 2 2 2 2\n  - Nine `0`s: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n  - Seven `1`s: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\nThus, the final output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1>>>"
