    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe input and output are identical. This suggests that the rule might involve leaving certain elements unchanged.\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 0 0 0 0\n\nAgain, the input and output are identical. This further supports the idea that the rule might involve leaving the input unchanged.\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n- **Output:** 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0\n\nIn this example, the input and output are not identical. The sequence of 8s is shifted to the left, and the trailing 8s are replaced with 0s.\n\n### Observations:\n- In Examples 1 and 2, the input and output are identical, suggesting that the rule might involve leaving certain elements unchanged.\n- In Example 3, the sequence of 8s is shifted to the left, and the trailing 8s are replaced with 0s.\n\n### Hypothesized Rule:\n- If the sequence of non-zero numbers is at the end of the grid, it remains unchanged.\n- If the sequence of non-zero numbers is in the middle of the grid, it is shifted to the left, and the trailing numbers are replaced with 0s.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0\n\nThe sequence of 4s is in the middle of the grid. According to the rule, this sequence should be shifted to the left, and the trailing numbers should be replaced with 0s.\n\n- **Output:** 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 2 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0>>>"
