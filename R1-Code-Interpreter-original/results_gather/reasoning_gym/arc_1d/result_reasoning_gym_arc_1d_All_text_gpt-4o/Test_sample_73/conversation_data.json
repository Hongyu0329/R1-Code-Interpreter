    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Observation:** The sequence of 9s is shifted left by one position, and the 2 remains in its original position.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Observation:** The sequence of 5s is shifted left by one position, and the 2 remains in its original position.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n- **Observation:** The sequence of 5s is shifted left by one position, and the 2 remains in its original position.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers (e.g., 9s, 5s) in the input grid.\n- Shift this sequence one position to the left in the output grid.\n- Any other non-zero numbers (e.g., 2) remain in their original positions.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0\n- **Process:**\n  - Identify the sequence of 7s: 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n  - Shift this sequence one position to the left.\n  - The 2 remains in its original position.\n\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n\nThus, the final output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2>>>"
