    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 7 7 7 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 1 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence of '7's in the input (7 7 7) is shifted one position to the left in the output (1 7 7 7).\n- The '1' remains in its position.\n- The trailing '0's are adjusted to maintain the grid length.\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 1 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 1 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence of '3's remains unchanged.\n- The '1' remains in its position.\n- The trailing '0's remain unchanged.\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 1 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n- **Output:** 1 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence of '7's is shifted one position to the left.\n- The '1' remains in its position.\n- The trailing '0' is added to maintain the grid length.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\nFrom the examples, the rule can be summarized as follows:\n1. Identify the first non-zero number in the input grid.\n2. If there is a sequence of the same non-zero number (other than the first one) following it, shift this sequence one position to the left.\n3. Maintain the position of the first non-zero number.\n4. Adjust the trailing '0's to maintain the grid length.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 1 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Step-by-step Application:**\n1. The first non-zero number is '1'.\n2. The next non-zero number is '9', but there is no sequence of '9's to shift.\n3. The '1' remains in its position.\n4. The grid remains unchanged as there is no sequence to shift.\n\nThus, the output grid is the same as the input grid.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<<<1 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
