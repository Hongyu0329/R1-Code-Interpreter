    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n\n**Observation:** \n- The input starts with two zeros, followed by a sequence of 5s, and ends with two zeros.\n- The output starts with four zeros, followed by the sequence of 5s, and ends with a single 5.\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The input starts with three zeros, followed by a sequence of 4s, and ends with four zeros.\n- The output starts with five zeros, followed by the sequence of 4s, and ends with two zeros.\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The input starts with ten zeros, followed by a sequence of 2s, and ends with ten zeros.\n- The output starts with twelve zeros, followed by the sequence of 2s, and ends with eight zeros.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n1. The sequence of non-zero numbers in the input remains unchanged in the output.\n2. The number of leading zeros in the output is increased by two compared to the input.\n3. The number of trailing zeros in the output is decreased by two compared to the input.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0\n- **Leading Zeros in Input:** 10\n- **Trailing Zeros in Input:** 4\n\n**Output Construction:**\n- Increase leading zeros by 2: 12 leading zeros.\n- Decrease trailing zeros by 2: 2 trailing zeros.\n- The sequence of 5s remains unchanged.\n\n**Test Output:**\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0>>>"
