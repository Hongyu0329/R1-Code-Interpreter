    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 8 8 8 8 2 2 2 2 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0\n\nObservations:\n- The first eight '2's in the input are transformed into '8's in the output.\n- The next four '2's remain unchanged.\n- The '0' remains unchanged.\n- The next eight '2's are transformed into '8's.\n- The last four '2's remain unchanged.\n- The final three '0's remain unchanged.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 8 2 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nObservations:\n- The first '2' is transformed into '8', the second '2' remains unchanged.\n- The two '0's remain unchanged.\n- The next four '2's are transformed into '8's.\n- The next '2' remains unchanged.\n- The next four '2's are transformed into '8's.\n- The remaining '0's remain unchanged.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 8 2 0 8 8 8 8 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nObservations:\n- The first '0' remains unchanged.\n- The first '2' is transformed into '8', the second '2' remains unchanged.\n- The next '0' remains unchanged.\n- The next four '2's are transformed into '8's.\n- The next '2' remains unchanged.\n- The remaining '0's remain unchanged.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- Transform the first '2' in each contiguous block of '2's into '8'.\n- If there are more than four '2's in a contiguous block, transform the first four '2's into '8's.\n- Leave '0's unchanged.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 0\n\nStep-by-step transformation:\n1. The first '0' remains unchanged.\n2. The first '2' in the block of '2's is transformed into '8'.\n3. The next three '2's are transformed into '8's.\n4. The next '2' remains unchanged.\n5. The next '2' remains unchanged.\n6. The next '2' remains unchanged.\n7. The next '2' remains unchanged.\n8. The next '2' remains unchanged.\n9. The next '0' remains unchanged.\n10. The next '0' remains unchanged.\n11. The next '0' remains unchanged.\n12. The next '0' remains unchanged.\n13. The next '0' remains unchanged.\n14. The next '0' remains unchanged.\n15. The next '0' remains unchanged.\n16. The first '2' in the block of '2's is transformed into '8'.\n17. The next three '2's are transformed into '8's.\n18. The next '2' remains unchanged.\n19. The next '2' remains unchanged.\n20. The next '0' remains unchanged.\n\n### Final Output:\n<<<0 8 8 8 8 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 2 2 0>>>"
