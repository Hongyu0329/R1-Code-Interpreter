    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 6 6 6 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence \"6 6 6\" in the input is shifted from the end of the second row to the start of the second row in the output.\n- The number \"2\" remains in the same position in both input and output.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence \"4 4\" in the input is shifted from the start of the second row to the end of the second row in the output.\n- The number \"2\" remains in the same position in both input and output.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 9\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The number \"9\" is moved from the end of the second row to the start of the first row in the output.\n- The number \"2\" remains in the same position in both input and output.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n1. Identify the non-zero sequence or number in the second row of the input grid.\n2. Shift this sequence or number to the start of the first row in the output grid.\n3. Keep the number \"2\" in the same position in both input and output grids.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 2 0 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Identify the sequence \"7 7 7\" in the second row.\n2. Shift \"7 7 7\" to the start of the first row in the output.\n3. Keep the number \"2\" in the same position.\n\n**Test Output:**\n- **Output:** 7 7 7 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<7 7 7 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
