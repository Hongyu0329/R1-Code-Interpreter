    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 2 0 7 7 7 7 7 7\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 2 7 7 7 7 7 7 0\n\n**Observations:**\n1. The sequence of numbers in the input grid is mostly preserved in the output grid.\n2. The first five numbers (0 0 0 0 2) remain unchanged.\n3. The sequence of 7s in the input (starting from the sixth position) is shifted one position to the left in the output.\n4. The last number in the output is 0, which replaces the last 7 from the input.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 2 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n- **Output:** 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0\n\n**Observations:**\n1. The first number (2) remains unchanged.\n2. The sequence of 6s in the input (starting from the third position) is shifted one position to the left in the output.\n3. The last number in the output is 0, which replaces the last 6 from the input.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 8 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 8 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observations:**\n1. The sequence of numbers in the input grid is preserved in the output grid.\n2. There is no sequence of repeating numbers to shift, so the output remains the same as the input.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\nFrom the examples, we can derive the following rule:\n- Identify the first non-zero number in the input grid.\n- If there is a sequence of repeating numbers following this non-zero number, shift this sequence one position to the left.\n- Replace the last number of this sequence in the output with 0.\n- If there is no sequence of repeating numbers, the output remains the same as the input.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 2\n\n**Steps:**\n1. The first non-zero number is 9.\n2. There is a sequence of repeating 9s.\n3. Shift the sequence of 9s one position to the left.\n4. Replace the last 9 with 0.\n\n**Output:** 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 2 0\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 2 0>>>"
