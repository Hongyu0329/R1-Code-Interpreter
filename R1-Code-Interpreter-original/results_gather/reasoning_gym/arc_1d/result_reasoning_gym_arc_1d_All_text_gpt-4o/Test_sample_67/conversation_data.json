    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The input contains two '4's at positions 5 and 19.\n- In the output, the '4's are extended to fill the positions between the two '4's in the input, from position 5 to 19.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The input contains two '4's at positions 4 and 7.\n- In the output, the '4's are extended to fill the positions between the two '4's in the input, from position 4 to 7.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The input contains two '2's at positions 8 and 12.\n- In the output, the '2's are extended to fill the positions between the two '2's in the input, from position 8 to 12.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\nFrom the examples, the rule can be derived as follows:\n- Identify the positions of the two non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n- Extend the non-zero number to fill all positions between the two identified positions in the output grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 9\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Identify the positions of the '9's in the input, which are at positions 17 and 21.\n2. Extend the '9' to fill all positions between 17 and 21 in the output.\n\n**Test Output:**\n- The output grid will have '9's from position 17 to 21.\n\nThus, the final output grid is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9>>>"
