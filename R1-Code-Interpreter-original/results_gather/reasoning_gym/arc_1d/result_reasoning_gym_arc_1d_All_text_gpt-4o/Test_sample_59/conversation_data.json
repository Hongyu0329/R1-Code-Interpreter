    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Observation:** The sequence of 7s in the input starts at position 17 and ends at position 22. In the output, the sequence of 7s starts at position 14 and ends at position 19. The sequence of 7s is shifted 3 positions to the left.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Observation:** The sequence of 8s in the input starts at position 6 and ends at position 20. In the output, the sequence of 8s starts at position 3 and ends at position 17. The sequence of 8s is shifted 3 positions to the left.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Observation:** The sequence of 4s in the input starts at position 9 and ends at position 22. In the output, the sequence of 4s starts at position 6 and ends at position 19. The sequence of 4s is shifted 3 positions to the left.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\nFrom the analysis of the examples, we can derive the following rule:\n- Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n- Shift this sequence 3 positions to the left in the output grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- The sequence of 8s in the input starts at position 10 and ends at position 16.\n- According to the rule, shift this sequence 3 positions to the left.\n- **Test Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
