    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input Grid**: 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output Grid**: 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0\n\nObservations:\n1. The first row remains unchanged.\n2. The second row in the output grid is a copy of the first row from the input grid.\n3. The third row in the output grid is a copy of the first row from the input grid.\n4. The fourth row in the output grid is a copy of the second row from the input grid.\n5. The fifth row in the output grid is a copy of the third row from the input grid.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input Grid**: 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0\n- **Output Grid**: 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0\n\nObservations:\n1. The first row remains unchanged.\n2. The second row in the output grid is a copy of the first row from the input grid.\n3. The third row in the output grid is a copy of the first row from the input grid.\n4. The fourth row in the output grid is a copy of the second row from the input grid.\n5. The fifth row in the output grid is a copy of the third row from the input grid.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input Grid**: 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output Grid**: 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nObservations:\n1. The first row remains unchanged.\n2. The second row in the output grid is a copy of the first row from the input grid.\n3. The third row in the output grid is a copy of the first row from the input grid.\n4. The fourth row in the output grid is a copy of the second row from the input grid.\n5. The fifth row in the output grid is a copy of the third row from the input grid.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\nFrom the analysis of the examples, the rule can be summarized as follows:\n- The first row of the output grid is the same as the first row of the input grid.\n- The second and third rows of the output grid are copies of the first row of the input grid.\n- The fourth row of the output grid is a copy of the second row of the input grid.\n- The fifth row of the output grid is a copy of the third row of the input grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input Grid**: 3 3 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n\nUsing the derived rule:\n1. The first row of the output grid is: 3 3 3 0 0\n2. The second row of the output grid is: 3 3 3 0 0 (copy of the first row)\n3. The third row of the output grid is: 3 3 3 0 0 (copy of the first row)\n4. The fourth row of the output grid is: 0 3 0 0 0 (copy of the second row)\n5. The fifth row of the output grid is: 3 0 0 0 3 (copy of the third row)\n\nThus, the output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<3 3 3 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0>>>"
