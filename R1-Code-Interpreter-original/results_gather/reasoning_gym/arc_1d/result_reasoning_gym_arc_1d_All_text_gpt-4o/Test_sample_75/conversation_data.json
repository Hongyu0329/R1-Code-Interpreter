    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 7 3 5 8 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 3 9 3 4 3 4 6 5 1 5 5 2 9\n- **Output:** 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 3 9 3 4 3 4 6 5 1 5 5 2 9 7 3 5 8\n\nObservations:\n- The first number of the input (7) is retained as the first number in the output.\n- The last four numbers of the input (7 3 5 8) are moved to the end of the output.\n- The rest of the numbers in the output are zeros, except for a segment that matches a part of the input.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 5 4 2 5 8 3 4 8 2 3 2 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 5 4 2 5 8 3 4 8 2 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nObservations:\n- The first 14 numbers of the input are zeros, and they remain zeros in the output.\n- The segment starting from the 15th number (7 5 4 2 5 8 3 4 8 2 3 2) is retained in the output.\n- The rest of the output is filled with zeros.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 2 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 2 4 4 3 5 7 1 5 5 7 5\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 2 4 4 3 5 7 1 5 5 7 5 2 4 0 0\n\nObservations:\n- The first 13 numbers of the input are zeros, and they remain zeros in the output.\n- The segment starting from the 14th number (8 2 4 4 3 5 7 1 5 5 7 5) is retained in the output.\n- The first two numbers of the input (2 4) are moved to the end of the output.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\nFrom the analysis, the rule can be summarized as follows:\n1. Identify the first non-zero segment in the input.\n2. Retain this segment in the output, starting from the position where the first non-zero number appears in the input.\n3. Move the initial non-zero numbers (before the first zero) to the end of the output.\n4. Fill the rest of the output with zeros.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 5 5 9 7 4 1 5 6 9 2 7 8 1 7 1 6 8 9 9 8 8 5 4 7 4 9 6 7 7\n\nSteps:\n1. The first non-zero segment starts from the first number (5 5 9 7 4 1 5 6 9 2 7 8 1 7 1 6 8 9 9 8 8 5 4 7 4 9 6 7 7).\n2. Retain this segment in the output.\n3. There are no zeros before the first non-zero number, so no numbers are moved to the end.\n4. The output is the same as the input.\n\nThus, the output for the test input is:\n\n<<<5 5 9 7 4 1 5 6 9 2 7 8 1 7 1 6 8 9 9 8 8 5 4 7 4 9 6 7 7>>>"
