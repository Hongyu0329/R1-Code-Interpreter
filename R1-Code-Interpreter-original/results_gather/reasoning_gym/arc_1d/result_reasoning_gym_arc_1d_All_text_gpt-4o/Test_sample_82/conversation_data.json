    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 3 1 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 3 1 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Observation:** The sequence \"9 3 1 4\" is shifted to the left, starting from the 11th position in the output.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 2 6 6 9 2 5 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 7 9 6 5 9 2 7 8 2\n- **Output:** 9 2 5 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 7 9 6 5 9 2 7 8 2 2 6 6\n- **Observation:** The sequence \"9 2 5 9\" is shifted to the start of the output, and the remaining numbers are shifted to the end.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 6 5 3 2 2 5 6 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 6 5 3 2 2 5 6 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Observation:** The sequence \"6 5 3 2 2 5 6 4\" is shifted to the left, starting from the 3rd position in the output.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\nFrom the examples, it appears that the rule involves identifying a non-zero sequence in the input and shifting it to the leftmost possible position in the output, while maintaining the order of the numbers. The remaining numbers are filled in the order they appear in the input.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 6 8 4 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 2\n- **Identified Sequence:** \"6 8 4 9\" (the first non-zero sequence)\n- **Output Construction:** Shift \"6 8 4 9\" to the start of the output, followed by the remaining numbers \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 2\".\n\nThus, the output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<answer>>> 6 8 4 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 2 <<<answer>>>"
