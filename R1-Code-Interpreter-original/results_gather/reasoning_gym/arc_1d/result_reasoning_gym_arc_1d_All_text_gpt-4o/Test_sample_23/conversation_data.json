    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence of three '2's in the input grid is shifted to the left by 4 positions in the output grid.\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- This example is identical to Example 1, confirming the same transformation: the sequence of '2's is shifted left by 4 positions.\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence of six '8's in the input grid is shifted to the left by 5 positions in the output grid.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n- Shift this sequence to the left by a number of positions equal to the number of leading zeros in the input grid before the sequence starts.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0\n- The sequence of '7's starts after 4 zeros.\n- According to the rule, shift the sequence of '7's to the left by 4 positions.\n\n**Test Output:**\n- After shifting, the output grid becomes: 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
