    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence of 4s remains unchanged.\n- The sequence of 1s is extended to the right, replacing the trailing 0s.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 5 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 5 5 5 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence of 7s remains unchanged.\n- The leading 0s are replaced by 5s, extending the sequence of 5s to the left.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence of 3s remains unchanged.\n- The leading 0s are replaced by 2s, extending the sequence of 2s to the left.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\nFrom the examples, we can derive the following rule:\n1. Identify the first non-zero number from the left in the input grid.\n2. Extend this number to the left, replacing any leading 0s.\n3. Identify the last non-zero number from the right in the input grid.\n4. Extend this number to the right, replacing any trailing 0s.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Step-by-step Application:**\n1. The first non-zero number from the left is 3. Extend 3 to the left, replacing the leading 0s.\n2. The last non-zero number from the right is 2. Extend 2 to the right, replacing the trailing 0s.\n\n**Output:**\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nThus, the output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2>>>"
