    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 5 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 5 0\n\n**Observation:** The sequence \"7 5\" is moved from positions 12 and 13 to positions 15 and 16, with zeros filling the preceding positions.\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 7 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 7\n\n**Observation:** The sequence \"1 7\" is moved from positions 13 and 14 to positions 16 and 17, with zeros filling the preceding positions.\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 6 6 1 3 3 6 9 6 4 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 1 3 3 6 9 6 4 0 0\n\n**Observation:** The sequence \"6 6 1 3 3 6 9 6 4\" is moved from positions 4 to 12 to positions 7 to 15, with zeros filling the preceding positions.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\nFrom the examples, it appears that the rule involves shifting the non-zero sequence to the rightmost part of the grid, while maintaining the order of the numbers. The zeros are filled in the positions before the shifted sequence.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 7 2 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Identify the non-zero sequence: \"7 2 7\".\n2. Determine the length of the non-zero sequence: 3 numbers.\n3. Place this sequence at the rightmost part of the grid, starting from position 15 (since the grid has 18 positions in total).\n4. Fill the preceding positions with zeros.\n\n**Test Output:**\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 2 7\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 2 7>>>"
