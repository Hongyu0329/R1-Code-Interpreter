    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 1 0 1 1 2 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 2 0 1 0 2 2 0\n- **Output:** 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 2\n- **Output:** 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 1 0 2 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 2 0 1 1 1 2 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Identify Patterns:**\n   - The output grid always starts with a sequence of 1s, followed by 0s, and ends with 2s.\n   - The number of 1s in the output seems to be the count of 1s in the input.\n   - The number of 2s in the output seems to be the count of 2s in the input.\n   - The number of 0s in the output is the remaining positions after accounting for 1s and 2s.\n\n2. **Count Elements:**\n   - For each example, count the number of 1s, 0s, and 2s in the input.\n   - Example 1: 1s = 7, 0s = 8, 2s = 4\n   - Example 2: 1s = 3, 0s = 13, 2s = 3\n   - Example 3: 1s = 6, 0s = 10, 2s = 3\n\n3. **Construct Output:**\n   - The output is constructed by placing all 1s first, followed by all 0s, and then all 2s.\n   - The length of the output is the same as the input.\n\n### Rule:\n- Count the number of 1s, 0s, and 2s in the input.\n- Construct the output by placing all 1s first, followed by all 0s, and then all 2s.\n\n### Test Input:\n- **Input:** 1 0 0 1 2 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 0 2 0 0 2 0\n\n### Applying the Rule:\n1. Count the elements:\n   - 1s = 5\n   - 0s = 9\n   - 2s = 5\n\n2. Construct the output:\n   - Start with 5 ones: 1 1 1 1 1\n   - Follow with 9 zeros: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - End with 5 twos: 2 2 2 2 2\n\n### Final Answer:\n<<<1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2>>>"
