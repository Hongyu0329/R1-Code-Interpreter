    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5\n- **Output:** 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The input grid has a sequence of three '5's at the beginning and two '5's at the end.\n- The output grid has two '5's at the beginning and three '5's at the end.\n- The zeros in the middle remain unchanged.\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n- **Output:** 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The input grid has a sequence of seven '1's at the beginning and five '1's at the end.\n- The output grid has six '1's at the beginning and six '1's at the end.\n- The zero in the middle remains unchanged.\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0\n- **Output:** 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 7\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The input grid has a sequence of eleven '7's at the beginning and two '0's at the end.\n- The output grid has ten '7's at the beginning, two '0's in the middle, and one '7' at the end.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\nFrom the analysis of the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- The sequence of identical numbers at the beginning of the input grid is reduced by one in the output grid.\n- The sequence of identical numbers at the end of the input grid is increased by one in the output grid.\n- The zeros in the middle remain unchanged.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n\n**Applying the Rule:**\n- The input grid has a sequence of thirteen '4's.\n- According to the rule, the output grid should have twelve '4's at the beginning and one '4' at the end.\n\nThus, the output grid should be:\n- **Output:** 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4>>>"
