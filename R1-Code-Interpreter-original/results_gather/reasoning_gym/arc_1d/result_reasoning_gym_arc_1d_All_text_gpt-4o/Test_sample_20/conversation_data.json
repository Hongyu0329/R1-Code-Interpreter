    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze each example step by step:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 1 0 2 0 0 1 2 1\n- **Output:** 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 1 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 1 2 2 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0\n- **Output:** 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1\n\n### Observations:\n1. **Leading 2s:** In all examples, the first two elements of the output are 2s. This suggests that the output always starts with two 2s.\n2. **Zeros:** After the initial 2s, the output contains a sequence of zeros. The number of zeros seems to be related to the number of zeros in the input.\n3. **Trailing 1s:** The output ends with a sequence of 1s. The number of 1s at the end of the output seems to match the number of 1s in the input.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n- **Step 1:** Start the output with two 2s.\n- **Step 2:** Count the number of zeros in the input. Place that many zeros after the initial two 2s in the output.\n- **Step 3:** Count the number of 1s in the input. Place that many 1s at the end of the output.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 0 1 2 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 2\n- **Step 1:** Start with two 2s: `2 2`\n- **Step 2:** Count zeros in the input: There are 4 zeros. Add 4 zeros: `2 2 0 0 0 0`\n- **Step 3:** Count 1s in the input: There are 4 ones. Add 4 ones: `2 2 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1`\n\nThus, the output for the test input is:\n\n<<<2 2 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1>>>"
