    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 2 1 0 0 9 4 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 2 1 0 0 9 4 0 0 3 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:** The first element (2) is moved to the second position, and all other elements are shifted one position to the right. The last element (0) is removed.\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 7 7 3 0 0 1 4 0 6 9 0 3\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 7 7 3 0 0 1 4 0 6 9 3\n\n**Observation:** The first element (0) is moved to the second position, and all other elements are shifted one position to the right. The last element (3) is removed.\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 5 7 6 0 1 0 6 6 0 0 0 5 2 0\n- **Output:** 0 5 7 6 0 1 0 6 6 0 0 0 5 2\n\n**Observation:** The first element (5) is moved to the second position, and all other elements are shifted one position to the right. The last element (0) is removed.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n1. Take the first element of the input grid and move it to the second position in the output grid.\n2. Shift all other elements one position to the right.\n3. Remove the last element of the input grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 3 0 0 4 6\n\n**Step-by-step Application:**\n1. Take the first element (0) and move it to the second position.\n2. Shift all other elements one position to the right.\n3. Remove the last element (6).\n\n**Output:** 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 3 0 0 4\n\nThus, the output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 3 0 0 4>>>"
