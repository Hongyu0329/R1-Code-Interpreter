    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:** \n- The sequence of '4's in the input grid is shifted one position to the left in the output grid.\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\n\n**Observation:** \n- The sequence of '1's in the input grid is shifted two positions to the left in the output grid.\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:** \n- The sequence of '9's in the input grid is shifted one position to the left in the output grid.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n- Shift this sequence to the left by a certain number of positions in the output grid.\n- The number of positions to shift seems to be determined by the length of the sequence of non-zero numbers:\n  - If the sequence length is 3 (as in Example 1 and 3), shift by 1 position.\n  - If the sequence length is 8 (as in Example 2), shift by 2 positions.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers: 9 9 9 9 9 9\n2. The length of this sequence is 6.\n3. Based on the examples, a sequence of length 6 should be shifted by 1 position to the left.\n\n**Test Output:**\n- Shift the sequence of '9's one position to the left: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 0\n\nThus, the output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 0>>>"
