    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 4 4 4 0 4 4 0 4 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 4 0 4 4 0 4 4 4 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The first row of the input is `4 4 4 0`.\n- The first row of the output is `4 0 4 4`.\n- The second row of the input is `4 4 0 4`.\n- The second row of the output is `4 0 4 4`.\n- The third row of the input is `0 4 4 4`.\n- The third row of the output is `0 4 4 4`.\n- The fourth row of the input is `4 0 0 0`.\n- The fourth row of the output is `4 0 0 0`.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 4 0 4 4 4 0 4 4 4 4 0 4 4 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 4 0 4 4 0 4 4 4 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The first row of the input is `4 0 4 4`.\n- The first row of the output is `4 0 4 4`.\n- The second row of the input is `4 0 4 4`.\n- The second row of the output is `4 0 4 4`.\n- The third row of the input is `4 4 0 4`.\n- The third row of the output is `4 4 0 4`.\n- The fourth row of the input is `4 0 0 0`.\n- The fourth row of the output is `4 0 0 0`.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 0 6 0 6 6 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The first row of the input is `6 6 6 0`.\n- The first row of the output is `6 0 6 6`.\n- The second row of the input is `6 6 6 6`.\n- The second row of the output is `6 0 6 6`.\n- The third row of the input is `0 6 0 6`.\n- The third row of the output is `0 6 6 6`.\n- The fourth row of the input is `6 0 0 0`.\n- The fourth row of the output is `6 0 0 0`.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- For each row, the first occurrence of a non-zero number is retained.\n- The second occurrence of a non-zero number in the row is replaced with zero.\n- The rest of the row remains unchanged.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 5 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 0 0 0\n\n**Step-by-step Application:**\n- First row: `5 0 5 5` becomes `5 0 5 5`.\n- Second row: `5 0 5 5` becomes `5 0 5 5`.\n- Third row: `5 5 0 5` becomes `5 0 5 5`.\n- Fourth row: `5 0 0 0` remains `5 0 0 0`.\n\nThus, the output grid is:\n\n<<<5 0 5 5 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0>>>"
