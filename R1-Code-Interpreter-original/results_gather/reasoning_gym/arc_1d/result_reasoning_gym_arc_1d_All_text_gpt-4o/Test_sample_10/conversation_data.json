    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 2 9 2 3 4 4 0\n- **Output:** 2 9 2 3 4 4 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The non-zero elements from the input (2, 9, 2, 3, 4, 4) are shifted to the left, maintaining their order.\n- The zeros are moved to the end of the sequence.\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 4 4 2 1 1 0\n- **Output:** 0 4 4 2 1 1 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The non-zero elements (4, 4, 2, 1, 1) are shifted to the left, maintaining their order.\n- The zeros are moved to the end of the sequence.\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 7 9 4 9 1 0 0\n- **Output:** 7 9 4 9 1 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The non-zero elements (7, 9, 4, 9, 1) are shifted to the left, maintaining their order.\n- The zeros are moved to the end of the sequence.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n1. Identify all non-zero elements in the input grid.\n2. Shift all non-zero elements to the left, maintaining their original order.\n3. Fill the remaining positions in the grid with zeros.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 1 5 0 0 0\n\n**Step-by-step Application:**\n1. Identify non-zero elements: 1, 5\n2. Shift non-zero elements to the left: 1, 5\n3. Fill the rest with zeros: 1, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n\nThus, the output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<1 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
