    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0\n\nObservations:\n- The sequence \"5 5\" from the input is moved to the end of the output grid.\n- The \"2\" remains in the same position in both input and output.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nObservations:\n- The sequence \"8 8 8 8 8\" is moved to the start of the output grid.\n- The \"2\" remains in the same position in both input and output.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nObservations:\n- The sequence \"6 6 6 6\" is moved to the third position in the output grid.\n- The \"2\" remains in the same position in both input and output.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n1. Identify the non-zero sequence in the input grid (other than the single \"2\").\n2. Move this sequence to the earliest possible position in the output grid, maintaining the order of the sequence.\n3. The \"2\" remains in its original position.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0\n\nSteps:\n1. Identify the sequence \"3 3 3 3 3 3 3\".\n2. Move this sequence to the earliest possible position in the output grid.\n3. Keep the \"2\" in its original position.\n\n### Test Output:\n- **Output:** 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
