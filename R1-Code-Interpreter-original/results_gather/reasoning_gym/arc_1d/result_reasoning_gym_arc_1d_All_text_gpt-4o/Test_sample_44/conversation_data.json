    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence of '6's in the input is extended by one additional '6' in the output, replacing the '2' in the input.\n- The '2' in the input is replaced by the number preceding it, which is '6'.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence of '9's in the input is extended to replace the '2' and all subsequent zeros.\n- The '2' in the input is replaced by the number following it, which is '9'.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The '2' in the input is replaced by the number preceding it, which is '9'.\n- The sequence of '9's is extended by one additional '9' in the output.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\nFrom the examples, the rule can be summarized as follows:\n- Identify the position of '2' in the input grid.\n- Replace the '2' with the number that is either immediately before or after it, depending on the context.\n- Extend the sequence of that number to replace the '2' and any subsequent zeros.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Identify the position of '2', which is at index 9.\n2. The number following '2' is '3'.\n3. Replace '2' and all subsequent zeros with '3'.\n\n**Output:**\n- The sequence of '3's starts from the position of '2' and continues to the end of the grid.\n\nThus, the output grid is:\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3>>>"
