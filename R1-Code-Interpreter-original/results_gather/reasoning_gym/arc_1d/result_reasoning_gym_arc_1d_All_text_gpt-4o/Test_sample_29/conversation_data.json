    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 8 8 2 2 0 0 8 8 2 2 0 0 0\n\nObservations:\n- The sequence of four '2's in the input (2 2 2 2) is transformed into two '8's followed by two '2's (8 8 2 2) in the output.\n- The rest of the numbers remain unchanged.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 8 2 0 0 0 0 8 8 2 2 2 0 0\n\nObservations:\n- The sequence of four '2's (2 2 2 2) is transformed into two '8's followed by two '2's (8 8 2 2).\n- A sequence of two '2's (2 2) remains as '8 2' in the output.\n- The rest of the numbers remain unchanged.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 2 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 8 8 2 2 2 0 8 8 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n\nObservations:\n- The sequence of four '2's (2 2 2 2) is transformed into two '8's followed by two '2's (8 8 2 2).\n- The sequence of two '2's (2 2) remains as '8 2' in the output.\n- The rest of the numbers remain unchanged.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\nFrom the examples, we can derive the following rule:\n- A sequence of four '2's (2 2 2 2) is transformed into two '8's followed by two '2's (8 8 2 2).\n- A sequence of two '2's (2 2) is transformed into '8 2'.\n- All other numbers remain unchanged.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 2 2 2\n\nStep-by-step transformation:\n1. The first sequence of four '2's (2 2 2 2) becomes (8 8 2 2).\n2. The next sequence of three '2's (2 2 2) remains unchanged as there is no rule for three '2's.\n3. The sequence of two '2's (2 2) becomes (8 2).\n\nThus, the transformed output grid is:\n0 0 8 8 2 2 2 2 8 2 0 0 0 8 2\n\n### Final Answer:\n<<<0 0 8 8 2 2 2 2 8 2 0 0 0 8 2>>>"
