    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n- **Output:** 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n\n**Observation:**\n- The first three '8's in the input are followed by five '0's. In the output, these '8's are extended to five '8's, followed by five '0's.\n- The sequence of '8's at the end of the input remains unchanged in the output.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n- **Output:** 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n\n**Observation:**\n- The first four '4's in the input are followed by eight '0's. In the output, these '4's are extended to six '4's, followed by eight '0's.\n- The sequence of '4's at the end of the input remains unchanged in the output.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n- **Output:** 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n\n**Observation:**\n- The single '7' in the input is followed by nine '0's. In the output, this '7' is extended to three '7's, followed by nine '0's.\n- The sequence of '7's at the end of the input remains unchanged in the output.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n1. Identify the initial sequence of non-zero numbers at the start of the input.\n2. Extend this sequence to a total of six non-zero numbers in the output, if possible.\n3. Maintain the sequence of zeros that follows.\n4. Keep the sequence of non-zero numbers at the end of the input unchanged in the output.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4\n\n**Application:**\n- The initial sequence of '4's is six '4's, which is already the maximum length we extend to, so it remains unchanged.\n- The sequence of zeros remains unchanged.\n- The single '4' at the end remains unchanged.\n\n**Output:**\n- 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4>>>"
