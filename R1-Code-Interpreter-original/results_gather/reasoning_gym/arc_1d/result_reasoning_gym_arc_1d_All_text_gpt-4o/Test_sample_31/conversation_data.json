    "To find the common rule that maps an input grid to an output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:** \n- The number '4' is moved to the position where the first '5' was located in the input.\n- The sequence of '5's is shifted one position to the right.\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 7 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 2 2 2 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The number '7' is moved to the position where the first '2' was located in the input.\n- The sequence of '2's is shifted one position to the right.\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 8 0 0\n- **Output:** 8 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The number '8' is moved to the position where the first '5' was located in the input.\n- The sequence of '5's is shifted one position to the right.\n\n### Common Rule:\nFrom the examples, the rule can be deduced as follows:\n1. Identify the last non-zero number in the input grid.\n2. Move this number to the position of the first occurrence of the next distinct number in the sequence.\n3. Shift the sequence of the next distinct number one position to the right.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 4 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Steps:**\n1. The last non-zero number is '4'.\n2. The first occurrence of the next distinct number '3' is at position 1.\n3. Move '4' to position 1.\n4. Shift the sequence of '3's one position to the right.\n\n**Output:** 3 4 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3 4 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
