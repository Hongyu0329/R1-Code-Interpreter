    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze each example step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 8 8 2 2 0 8 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nObservations:\n- The first two elements remain unchanged.\n- The third and fourth elements change from 2 to 8.\n- The fifth and sixth elements remain 2.\n- The eighth element changes from 2 to 8.\n- The nineteenth element changes from 2 to 8.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 8 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nObservations:\n- The first element remains unchanged.\n- The second to eighth elements change from 2 to 8.\n- The ninth to fifteenth elements remain 2.\n- The eighteenth element changes from 2 to 8.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 8 2 2 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 8 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nObservations:\n- The first element changes from 2 to 8.\n- The fifth to eleventh elements change from 2 to 8.\n- The nineteenth element changes from 2 to 8.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- Change the first occurrence of a sequence of '2's to '8's, starting from the first '2' and continuing until a '0' is encountered or the sequence ends.\n- If there are multiple sequences of '2's, only the first sequence is changed to '8's.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nFollowing the rule:\n- The first sequence of '2's (from the first to the eighth position) is changed to '8's.\n- The rest of the grid remains unchanged.\n\nThus, the output grid is:\n- **Output:** 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nFinal answer:\n<<<8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
