    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze each example step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 3 3 3 3 3 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 0\n- **Output:** 2 2 2 2 2 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\n\nObservations:\n- The first five '3's in the input are transformed to '2's in the output.\n- The '0' in the input remains '0' in the output.\n- The next six '3's in the input are transformed to '1's in the output.\n- The final '0' in the input remains '0' in the output.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 3 3 3 3 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0\n- **Output:** 2 2 2 2 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\n\nObservations:\n- The first four '3's in the input are transformed to '2's in the output.\n- The '0' in the input remains '0' in the output.\n- The next seven '3's in the input are transformed to '1's in the output.\n- The final '0' in the input remains '0' in the output.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 3 3 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n- **Output:** 0 2 2 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\nObservations:\n- The initial '0' in the input remains '0' in the output.\n- The next two '3's in the input are transformed to '2's in the output.\n- The next two '0's in the input remain '0's in the output.\n- The remaining seven '3's in the input are transformed to '1's in the output.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n1. The first sequence of '3's in the input is transformed to '2's in the output.\n2. Any '0' in the input remains '0' in the output.\n3. The remaining sequence of '3's in the input is transformed to '1's in the output.\n\n### Test Input Analysis:\n- **Input:** 3 3 3 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0\n\nApplying the rule:\n1. The first three '3's are transformed to '2's.\n2. The '0' remains '0'.\n3. The next seven '3's are transformed to '1's.\n4. The final two '0's remain '0's.\n\nThus, the output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<2 2 2 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0>>>"
