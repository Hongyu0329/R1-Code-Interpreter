    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence of 7s in the input is shifted to the right by 3 positions in the output.\n- The zeros at the end of the input are moved to the beginning of the output, filling the first three positions.\n- The last position in the output is filled with a zero.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence of 3s in the input is shifted to the right by 3 positions in the output.\n- The zeros at the end of the input are moved to the beginning of the output, filling the first three positions.\n- The remaining positions after the sequence of 3s are filled with zeros.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The single 2 in the input is shifted to the right by 3 positions in the output.\n- The zeros at the beginning of the input remain zeros in the output.\n- The zeros at the end of the input fill the remaining positions in the output.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\nFrom the analysis of the examples, the rule can be summarized as follows:\n1. Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers in the input.\n2. Shift this sequence to the right by 3 positions in the output.\n3. Fill the first three positions of the output with zeros.\n4. Fill any remaining positions in the output with zeros.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Step-by-step Application:**\n1. Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers: 2 2 2.\n2. Shift this sequence to the right by 3 positions: 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2.\n3. Fill the first three positions with zeros: 0 0 0.\n4. The remaining positions are already zeros.\n\n**Final Output:**\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThus, the output for the test input is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
