    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 4 4 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 4 4 4 0 4 4 4 0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nObservations:\n1. The first three elements (4 4 4) remain unchanged.\n2. The next two elements (0 0) are followed by a 4, which is repeated in the output.\n3. The next three elements (0 0 0) are followed by a 4, which is repeated in the output.\n4. The last six elements (0 0 0 0 0 0) remain unchanged.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 9 9 9 0 0 9 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 9 9 9 0 9 9 9 0 9 9 9 0 9 9 9 0 0 0 0\n\nObservations:\n1. The first three elements (9 9 9) remain unchanged.\n2. The next two elements (0 0) are followed by a 9, which is repeated in the output.\n3. The next three elements (0 0 0) are followed by a 9, which is repeated in the output.\n4. The last six elements (0 0 0 0 0 0) remain unchanged.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 5 5 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nObservations:\n1. The first five elements (5 5 5 5 5) remain unchanged.\n2. The next three elements (0 0 0) are followed by a 5, which is repeated in the output.\n3. The next three elements (0 0 0) are followed by a 5, which is repeated in the output.\n4. The last six elements (0 0 0 0 0 0) remain unchanged.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\nFrom the examples, the rule can be summarized as follows:\n- The initial sequence of non-zero numbers remains unchanged.\n- For each sequence of zeros followed by a non-zero number, the non-zero number is repeated in the output grid.\n- The trailing zeros remain unchanged.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n\nFollowing the rule:\n1. The first five elements (2 2 2 2 2) remain unchanged.\n2. The next three elements (0 0 0) are followed by a 2, which is repeated in the output.\n3. The next three elements (0 0 0) are followed by a 2, which is repeated in the output.\n4. The last six elements (0 0 0 0 0 0) remain unchanged.\n\nThus, the output grid is:\n<<<2 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0>>>"
