    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 2 9 0 1 1 9 9 0 1 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 2 9 0 1 1 9 9 0 1 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The first two zeros in the input are replaced by a single zero in the output.\n- The sequence of numbers following the initial zeros remains unchanged.\n- An additional zero is appended at the end of the output.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 2 6 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 2 6 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The first zero in the sequence of zeros is removed.\n- The sequence of numbers following the initial zeros remains unchanged.\n- An additional zero is appended at the end of the output.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 2 0 4 3 8 0 0 5 7 7 1 0 0\n- **Output:** 2 4 3 8 0 0 5 7 7 1 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The first zero in the sequence of zeros is removed.\n- The sequence of numbers following the initial zeros remains unchanged.\n- An additional zero is appended at the end of the output.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\nFrom the analysis of the examples, the rule can be summarized as follows:\n1. Identify the first occurrence of a zero in the input grid.\n2. Remove this first zero from the sequence.\n3. Keep the rest of the sequence unchanged.\n4. Append an additional zero at the end of the output grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 3 8 4 0 0 0 7 7 1 0 5 0 0\n\n**Step-by-step Application:**\n1. Identify the first zero: The first zero appears at the fourth position.\n2. Remove this first zero: The sequence becomes 3 8 4 0 0 7 7 1 0 5 0 0.\n3. Append an additional zero at the end: The final output becomes 3 8 4 0 0 7 7 1 0 5 0 0 0.\n\nThus, the output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<3 8 4 0 0 7 7 1 0 5 0 0 0>>>"
