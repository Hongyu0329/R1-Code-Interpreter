    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 2 7 9 8 3 2 1 5 3 6 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 9 8 3 2 1 5 3 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 7\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence of non-zero numbers in the input is: 2, 7, 9, 8, 3, 2, 1, 5, 3, 6.\n- In the output, the sequence starts with 9, 8, 3, 2, 1, 5, 3, 6, followed by 0s, and ends with 2, 7.\n- The first two non-zero numbers (2, 7) from the input are moved to the end of the output.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 9 5 1 3 8 3 8 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n- **Output:** 8 3 8 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 9 5 1 3\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence of non-zero numbers in the input is: 9, 5, 1, 3, 8, 3, 8, 3, 7.\n- In the output, the sequence starts with 8, 3, 8, 3, followed by 0s, and ends with 7, 9, 5, 1, 3.\n- The first four non-zero numbers (9, 5, 1, 3) from the input are moved to the end of the output.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence of non-zero numbers in the input is: 3.\n- In the output, the sequence remains the same, with 3 in the same position.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n1. Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers in the input.\n2. Move the first few non-zero numbers to the end of the sequence in the output.\n3. The number of non-zero numbers moved to the end seems to be determined by the position of the first zero in the input after the initial non-zero sequence.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 2 7 0\n- The sequence of non-zero numbers is: 7, 2, 7.\n- The first zero after the non-zero sequence is at position 16.\n- Move the first two non-zero numbers (7, 2) to the end of the sequence.\n\n**Output:** 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 7\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 7>>>"
