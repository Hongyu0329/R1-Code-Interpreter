    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The input grid is a 4x6 matrix.\n- The output grid is also a 4x6 matrix.\n- The first row of the input becomes the last row of the output.\n- The last row of the input becomes the first row of the output.\n- The second and third rows remain unchanged.\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n- **Output:** 6 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The input grid is a 4x6 matrix.\n- The output grid is also a 4x6 matrix.\n- The first row of the input becomes the last row of the output.\n- The last row of the input becomes the first row of the output.\n- The second and third rows remain unchanged.\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n- **Output:** 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The input grid is a 4x6 matrix.\n- The output grid is also a 4x6 matrix.\n- Since all elements are the same, swapping the first and last rows does not change the grid.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\nFrom the analysis of the examples, the rule can be summarized as:\n- Swap the first and last rows of the input grid to form the output grid.\n- The second and third rows remain unchanged.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Grid Representation:**\n  ```\n  0 0 0 0 0 0\n  0 0 0 0 0 0\n  0 0 0 0 0 6\n  6 0 0 0 0 0\n  ```\n- **Output:**\n  - Swap the first and last rows:\n  ```\n  6 0 0 0 0 0\n  0 0 0 0 0 0\n  0 0 0 0 0 6\n  0 0 0 0 0 0\n  ```\n\nThus, the output grid is:\n\n<<<answer>>>\n6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n<<<answer>>>"
