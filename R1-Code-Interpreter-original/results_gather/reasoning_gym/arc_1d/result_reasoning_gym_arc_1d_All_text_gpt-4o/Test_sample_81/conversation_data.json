    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence of 1s in the input starts at position 1 and ends at position 24.\n- In the output, the sequence of 1s starts at position 5 and ends at position 28.\n- The sequence of 1s is shifted 4 positions to the right.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence of 6s in the input starts at position 8 and ends at position 23.\n- In the output, the sequence of 6s starts at position 12 and ends at position 27.\n- The sequence of 6s is shifted 4 positions to the right.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence of 1s in the input starts at position 13 and ends at position 21.\n- In the output, the sequence of 1s starts at position 17 and ends at position 25.\n- The sequence of 1s is shifted 4 positions to the right.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\nFrom the analysis of the examples, we can derive the following rule:\n- Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n- Shift this sequence 4 positions to the right in the output grid.\n- Maintain the same sequence length and values.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Identify the sequence of 3s in the input, which starts at position 9 and ends at position 11.\n2. Shift this sequence 4 positions to the right, so it starts at position 13 and ends at position 15 in the output.\n\n**Test Output:**\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
