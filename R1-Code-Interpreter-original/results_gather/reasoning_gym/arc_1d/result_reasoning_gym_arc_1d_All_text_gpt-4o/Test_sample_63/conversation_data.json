    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 6 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5\n- **Output:** 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 5\n\nObservations:\n1. The non-zero numbers in the input are 6, 1, 2, 3, and 5.\n2. In the output, each non-zero number from the input is repeated multiple times consecutively.\n3. The number of repetitions seems to be determined by the position of the non-zero number in the input.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 2 0 5\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 2 2 5\n\nObservations:\n1. The non-zero numbers in the input are 4, 2, and 5.\n2. In the output, 4 is repeated 5 times, 2 is repeated 2 times, and 5 is repeated once.\n3. The repetition count seems to be the number of zeros before the non-zero number in the input plus one.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 5 0 0 0 0 7 3 0 0 0 0 0 8 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 5 7 7 7 7 7 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nObservations:\n1. The non-zero numbers in the input are 5, 7, 3, and 8.\n2. In the output, 5 is repeated once, 7 is repeated 5 times, 3 is repeated once, and 8 is repeated 6 times.\n3. The repetition count is the number of zeros before the non-zero number in the input plus one.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\nFrom the analysis, the rule can be summarized as:\n- For each non-zero number in the input, count the number of zeros before it.\n- The non-zero number in the output is repeated (number of zeros before it + 1) times.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 5\n\nSteps:\n1. The first non-zero number is 9, preceded by 5 zeros. So, 9 is repeated 6 times.\n2. The next non-zero number is 2, preceded by 2 zeros. So, 2 is repeated 3 times.\n3. The next non-zero number is 2 again, preceded by 5 zeros. So, 2 is repeated 6 times.\n4. The next non-zero number is 7, preceded by 4 zeros. So, 7 is repeated 5 times.\n5. The last non-zero number is 5, preceded by 3 zeros. So, 5 is repeated 4 times.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe output grid is:\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 7 7 7 7 7 5 5 5 5>>>"
