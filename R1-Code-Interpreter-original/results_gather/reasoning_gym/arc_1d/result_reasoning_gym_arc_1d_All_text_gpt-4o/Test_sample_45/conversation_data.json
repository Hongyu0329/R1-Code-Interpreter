    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 4 0 8 0 0 9 0 0 0 8 4 0 0 6 9 0 0 4 4 0\n- **Output:** 4 8 9 8 4 6 9 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nObservations:\n1. The first part of the output (4 8 9 8 4 6 9 4 4) seems to be a rearrangement of the non-zero numbers from the input.\n2. The rest of the output is filled with zeros.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 4 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 9 0 9 7 0 0 0 8 3\n- **Output:** 4 8 9 9 7 8 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nObservations:\n1. The first part of the output (4 8 9 9 7 8 3) is a rearrangement of the non-zero numbers from the input.\n2. The rest of the output is filled with zeros.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 1 1 0 0 5 0 0 0 8 0 0 9 8 0 0 0 0 8 1\n- **Output:** 1 1 5 8 9 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nObservations:\n1. The first part of the output (1 1 5 8 9 8 8 1) is a rearrangement of the non-zero numbers from the input.\n2. The rest of the output is filled with zeros.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\nFrom the analysis of the examples, the rule can be derived as follows:\n- Extract all non-zero numbers from the input grid.\n- Rearrange these numbers to form the beginning of the output grid.\n- Fill the rest of the output grid with zeros.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 8 7 0 3 4 0 3 1 0 9 0 0 0 0 9 2 7 5 4\n\nSteps:\n1. Extract non-zero numbers: 8, 7, 3, 4, 3, 1, 9, 9, 2, 7, 5, 4.\n2. Rearrange these numbers to form the beginning of the output grid.\n3. Fill the rest of the output grid with zeros.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe output grid based on the derived rule is:\n<<<8 7 3 4 3 1 9 9 2 7 5 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
