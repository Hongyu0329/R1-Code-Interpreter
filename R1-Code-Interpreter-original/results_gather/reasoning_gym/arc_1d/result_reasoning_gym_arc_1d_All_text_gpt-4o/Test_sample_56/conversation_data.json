    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze each example step by step:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence of 1s in the input (from index 1 to 6) is shifted to the right by 7 positions in the output (from index 7 to 12).\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The single 6 in the input (at index 13) is shifted to the right by 1 position in the output (to index 14).\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence of 4s in the input (from index 0 to 7) is shifted to the right by 8 positions in the output (from index 8 to 15).\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- Identify the contiguous block of non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n- Shift this block to the rightmost available position in the output grid, maintaining the order and length of the block.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Identify the block of non-zero numbers: 3 3 (from index 11 to 12).\n2. Shift this block to the rightmost available position in the output grid: 3 3 should be placed at indices 14 and 15.\n\nThus, the output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3>>>"
