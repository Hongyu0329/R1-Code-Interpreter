    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 3 7 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 3 7 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:** \n- The sequence \"9 3 7\" from the input is moved to the leftmost position in the output, while the rest of the elements are shifted to the right.\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 6 6 9 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 1 8\n- **Output:** 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 1 8 6 6 9\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence \"2\" from the input is moved to the leftmost position in the output, while the rest of the elements are shifted to the right.\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 7 7 7 7 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence \"7 7 7 7 3 2\" from the input is moved to the leftmost position in the output, while the rest of the elements are shifted to the right.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\nFrom the examples, it appears that the rule involves identifying a non-zero sequence in the input grid and moving it to the leftmost position in the output grid. The rest of the elements are shifted to the right to fill the remaining positions.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n1. Identify the non-zero sequence in the input grid. Here, it is \"7\".\n2. Move this sequence to the leftmost position in the output grid.\n3. Shift the remaining elements to the right to fill the grid.\n\n**Test Output:**\n- The sequence \"7\" is moved to the leftmost position, and the rest are zeros.\n\nThus, the final output grid is:\n\n<<<7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
