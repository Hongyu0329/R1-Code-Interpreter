    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The input grid has a sequence of zeros followed by a sequence of fours, and then a zero at the end.\n- The output grid shifts the sequence of fours two positions to the left, replacing the first two zeros with fours and moving the last two fours to the end.\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 6 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n- **Output:** 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n\n**Observation:**\n- The input grid has a sequence of sixes, a zero, and then more sixes.\n- The output grid shifts the sequence of sixes one position to the right, placing a zero in the third position.\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8\n- **Output:** 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8\n\n**Observation:**\n- The input grid has a sequence of eights, followed by zeros, and then eights again.\n- The output grid shifts the sequence of eights two positions to the right, filling the first two positions with eights and moving the last two eights to the end.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n- Shift this sequence to the left or right, depending on the position of zeros, to fill the grid while maintaining the sequence's integrity.\n- The number of positions to shift seems to be determined by the number of zeros or the position of zeros in the input grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The input grid has a sequence of twos, followed by zeros, and then more twos.\n- According to the rule, we need to shift the sequence of twos to the right, filling the first two positions with twos and moving the last two twos to the end.\n\n**Output:**\n- The output grid should be: 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2>>>"
