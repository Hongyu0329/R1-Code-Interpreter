    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 2 0 2 0 0 0 2 2 0 2 1\n- **Output:** 2 2 2 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 2 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 2 1\n- **Output:** 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 1 2 0 2 1 0 2 0\n- **Output:** 2 2 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations:\n1. **Leading 2s:** In all examples, the output starts with a sequence of '2's. The number of '2's at the beginning of the output seems to be the count of '2's in the input.\n2. **Sequence of 1s:** After the initial '2's, there is a sequence of '1's in the output. The number of '1's in the output corresponds to the count of '1's in the input.\n3. **Trailing 0s:** The rest of the output is filled with '0's. The total length of the output is the same as the input, so the number of '0's is the remaining length after accounting for the '2's and '1's.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n- Count the number of '2's in the input and place that many '2's at the start of the output.\n- Count the number of '1's in the input and place that many '1's immediately after the '2's in the output.\n- Fill the rest of the output with '0's to match the length of the input.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 0 0\n- Count of '2's: 4\n- Count of '1's: 0\n- Total length of input: 11\n\n### Constructing the Output:\n- Start with four '2's: 2 2 2 2\n- No '1's to add.\n- Fill the rest with '0's to make the total length 11: 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThus, the output for the test input is:\n\n<<<2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
