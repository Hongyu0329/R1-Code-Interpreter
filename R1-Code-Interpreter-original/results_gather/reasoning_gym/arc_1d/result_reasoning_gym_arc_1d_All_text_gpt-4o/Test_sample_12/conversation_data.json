    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0\n\nObservations:\n- The first and last non-zero numbers in the input (9) are retained in the output.\n- All other non-zero numbers in between are replaced with 0.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nObservations:\n- The first and last non-zero numbers in the input (3) are retained in the output.\n- All other non-zero numbers in between are replaced with 0.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nObservations:\n- The first and last non-zero numbers in the input (5) are retained in the output.\n- All other non-zero numbers in between are replaced with 0.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\nFrom the analysis of the examples, the rule can be summarized as follows:\n- Identify the first and last non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n- Retain these numbers in their respective positions in the output grid.\n- Replace all other non-zero numbers in between with 0.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nFollowing the rule:\n- The first non-zero number is 2 (at position 0).\n- The last non-zero number is 2 (at position 17).\n- Retain these numbers in the output.\n- Replace all other non-zero numbers in between with 0.\n\nThus, the output grid is:\n- **Output:** 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nFinal answer:\n<<<2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
