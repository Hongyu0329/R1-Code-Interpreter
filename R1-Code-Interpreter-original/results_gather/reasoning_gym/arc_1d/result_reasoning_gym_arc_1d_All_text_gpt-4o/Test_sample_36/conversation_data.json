    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n\nObservations:\n- The first row of the input grid (2 2 2 2 2 2) is transformed to (1 1 1 1 1 1) in the output grid.\n- The rest of the grid remains unchanged.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 4 4 0 4 4 4 4 4 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 4 4 0 4 4 4 4 4 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0\n\nObservations:\n- The third row of the input grid (4 4 4 4 4 4) is transformed to (1 1 1 1 1 1) in the output grid.\n- The rest of the grid remains unchanged.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 6 6 6 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0\n\nObservations:\n- The second row of the input grid (6 6 6 6 6 6) is transformed to (1 1 1 1 1 1) in the output grid.\n- The rest of the grid remains unchanged.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- Identify the row in the input grid that contains a sequence of identical non-zero numbers.\n- Transform that entire row to a sequence of 1s in the output grid.\n- Leave all other rows unchanged.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0\n\nFollowing the rule:\n- The third row (9 9 9 9 9 9) is a sequence of identical non-zero numbers.\n- Transform this row to (1 1 1 1 1 1) in the output grid.\n- Leave all other rows unchanged.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe output grid for the test input is:\n<<<0 0 0 9 9 9 9 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0>>>"
