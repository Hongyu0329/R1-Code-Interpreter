    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 6 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The first three elements in the input are 6 6 6, and they become 6 0 6 in the output.\n- The next three elements are 0 6 6, and they remain unchanged in the output.\n- The next three elements are 0 6 0, and they become 6 6 0 in the output.\n- The last four elements (0 0 0 0) remain unchanged.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 3 3 3 0 3 3 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 3 0 3 3 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The first three elements in the input are 3 3 3, and they become 3 0 3 in the output.\n- The next three elements are 0 3 3, and they remain unchanged in the output.\n- The next three elements are 0 3 0, and they become 3 3 0 in the output.\n- The last four elements (0 0 0 0) remain unchanged.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The first three elements in the input are 2 0 2, and they remain unchanged in the output.\n- The next three elements are 2 2 0, and they become 2 0 2 in the output.\n- The next three elements are 2 2 0, and they become 2 2 0 in the output.\n- The last four elements (0 0 0 0) remain unchanged.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\nFrom the analysis, we can derive the following rule:\n1. The first three elements of the input grid are transformed such that the middle element becomes 0, while the first and last elements remain the same.\n2. The second set of three elements remains unchanged.\n3. The third set of three elements is transformed such that the first two elements become the same as the first element of the input grid, and the last element remains unchanged.\n4. The last four elements remain unchanged.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 9 0 9 9 9 0 9 9 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Step-by-step Transformation:**\n1. First three elements (9 0 9) become 9 0 9.\n2. Second three elements (9 9 0) remain 9 9 0.\n3. Third three elements (9 9 0) become 9 9 0.\n4. Last four elements (0 0 0 0) remain 0 0 0 0.\n\nThus, the output grid is:\n\n<<<9 0 9 9 0 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
