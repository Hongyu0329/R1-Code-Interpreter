    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 9 1 2 1 7 5 7 6 6 9 9 8 9 7 5 9 4 4 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 1 2 1 7 5 7 6 6 9 9 8 9 7 5 9 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence of non-zero numbers in the input (9 1 2 1 7 5 7 6 6 9 9 8 9 7 5 9 4 4) is shifted to the left in the output.\n- The first non-zero number (9) is removed, and the sequence starts from the second non-zero number (1).\n- The last number in the output is the first non-zero number from the input (9).\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 1 4 8 6 5 6 3 8 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 1 4 8 6 5 6 3 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence of non-zero numbers in the input (8 1 4 8 6 5 6 3 8) is shifted to the left in the output.\n- The first non-zero number (8) is removed, and the sequence starts from the second non-zero number (1).\n- The last number in the output is the first non-zero number from the input (8).\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 9 3 2 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 9 3 2 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence of non-zero numbers in the input (9 3 2 2 1 1) is shifted to the left in the output.\n- The first non-zero number (9) is removed, and the sequence starts from the second non-zero number (3).\n- The last number in the output is the first non-zero number from the input (9).\n\n### Rule Derivation:\nFrom the analysis, the rule can be summarized as follows:\n1. Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n2. Remove the first non-zero number from this sequence.\n3. Shift the remaining sequence to the left.\n4. Place the removed first non-zero number at the end of the output grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 8 9 2 8 8 6 3 9 8 2 6 4 7 7\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers: 1 8 9 2 8 8 6 3 9 8 2 6 4 7 7.\n2. Remove the first non-zero number: 1.\n3. Shift the remaining sequence to the left: 8 9 2 8 8 6 3 9 8 2 6 4 7 7.\n4. Place the removed number (1) at the end of the output grid.\n\n**Output:**\n- 8 9 2 8 8 6 3 9 8 2 6 4 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<8 9 2 8 8 6 3 9 8 2 6 4 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1>>>"
