    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 7 7\n- **Output:** 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The first 10 elements remain unchanged.\n- The next 4 elements (11th to 14th) are changed from 7 to 0.\n- The last 6 elements remain unchanged.\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The first 3 elements are changed from 3 to 0.\n- The next 10 elements remain unchanged.\n- The last 7 elements are changed from 3 to 0.\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The first 3 elements remain unchanged.\n- The next 4 elements (4th to 7th) are changed from 9 to 0.\n- The next 9 elements remain unchanged.\n- The last 4 elements are changed from 0 to 9.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\nFrom the examples, it seems that the rule involves:\n1. Identifying a block of numbers that are either changed to 0 or remain unchanged.\n2. The changes seem to occur in blocks, either at the beginning, middle, or end of the sequence.\n3. The unchanged blocks are typically surrounded by blocks that are changed to 0.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The first 7 elements are 0 and remain unchanged.\n- The next 8 elements are 8 and remain unchanged.\n- The last 5 elements are 0 and remain unchanged.\n\nThus, the output grid should be the same as the input grid because the pattern of unchanged blocks surrounded by zeros is already present.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
