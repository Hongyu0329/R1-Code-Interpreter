    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 9 4 0 0 0 0 0 5 3 0 9 0 9 1 0 0 3\n- **Output:** 9 4 0 0 0 0 5 3 0 9 0 9 1 0 0 3 0\n\n**Observation:** The output is the same as the input, except that a '0' is added at the end.\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 7 3 1 7 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8\n- **Output:** 0 0 7 3 1 7 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0\n\n**Observation:** The output is the same as the input, except that the first three '0's are removed, and a '0' is added at the end.\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 8 4 7 5 8 0 4 0 0 0 2 4 6 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 8 4 7 5 8 0 4 0 0 0 2 4 6 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:** The output is the same as the input, except that the first two '0's are removed, and a '0' is added at the end.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n1. Remove leading zeros from the input grid.\n2. Append a '0' to the end of the resulting sequence.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 0 3 7 9 4 0 5 0 0 0 0 2 0 3 2 3 0\n\n**Step-by-step Application:**\n1. Remove leading zeros: The input starts with a single '0', so remove it.\n   - Resulting sequence: 3 7 9 4 0 5 0 0 0 0 2 0 3 2 3 0\n2. Append a '0' to the end of the sequence.\n   - Final output: 3 7 9 4 0 5 0 0 0 0 2 0 3 2 3 0 0\n\nThus, the output for the test input is:\n\n<<<3 7 9 4 0 5 0 0 0 0 2 0 3 2 3 0 0>>>"
