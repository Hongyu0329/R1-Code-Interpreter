    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 6 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 6 6 0 6 6 6 0\n- **Output:** 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n\nObservations:\n- The input grid has a mix of 0s and 6s.\n- The output grid seems to rearrange these numbers.\n- The first 6 in the input becomes the first element in the output.\n- The pattern seems to involve shifting or rearranging the numbers.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 6 6 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 6 6 0 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nObservations:\n- The input grid starts with two 6s, and the output grid also starts with two 6s.\n- The sequence of 6s in the input is rearranged in the output.\n- The zeros are pushed towards the end of the output grid.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0\n- **Output:** 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nObservations:\n- The input grid has a mix of 0s and 1s.\n- The output grid starts with a 1, followed by a 0, and then rearranges the 1s and 0s.\n- The zeros are again pushed towards the end of the output grid.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n1. Identify the non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n2. Rearrange these non-zero numbers to the start of the output grid, maintaining their relative order.\n3. Push all zeros to the end of the output grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0 0\n\nFollowing the rule:\n1. Identify non-zero numbers: 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n2. Rearrange these numbers to the start of the output grid: 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n3. Push all zeros to the end: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThus, the output grid is:\n<<<7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
