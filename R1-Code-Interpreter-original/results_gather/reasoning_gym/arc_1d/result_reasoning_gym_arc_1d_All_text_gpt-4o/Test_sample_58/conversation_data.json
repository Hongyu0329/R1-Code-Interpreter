    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The input grid has 12 elements.\n- The output grid also has 12 elements.\n- The first three elements of the input (5 5 0) are transformed to (0 0 0) in the output.\n- The next three elements of the input (0 0 0) are transformed to (5 5 5) in the output.\n- The last six elements of the input (5 5 5 5 5 5) remain the same in the output except the last element, which becomes 0.\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 8\n- **Output:** 8 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The first four elements of the input (8 8 8 8) remain the same in the output.\n- The fifth element of the input (8) is transformed to 0 in the output.\n- The remaining elements (8 8 8 0 8 8 8) remain the same in the output.\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 5 5\n- **Output:** 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 5 5 5 5 5\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The first five elements of the input (5 5 5 5 5) remain the same in the output.\n- The next two elements (5 5) are transformed to (0 0) in the output.\n- The remaining elements (5 0 0 5 5) remain the same in the output.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\nFrom the analysis, we can deduce the following rule:\n- Identify the first occurrence of a sequence of zeros in the input.\n- Transform the elements before this sequence of zeros to zeros in the output.\n- Transform the sequence of zeros to the preceding non-zero number in the output.\n- Keep the remaining elements the same, except the last element, which becomes zero if it was non-zero.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0\n\n**Step-by-step Application:**\n1. The first occurrence of zeros is at the 9th position.\n2. Transform the first eight elements (6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6) to zeros in the output.\n3. Transform the sequence of zeros (0 0 0 0) to the preceding non-zero number (6) in the output.\n4. The output grid becomes: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6\n\nThus, the final output grid is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6>>>"
