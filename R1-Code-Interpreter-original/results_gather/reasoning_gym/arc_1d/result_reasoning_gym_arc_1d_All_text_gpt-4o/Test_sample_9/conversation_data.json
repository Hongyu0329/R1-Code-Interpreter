    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 7 0 0 7 0 0 7 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nObservations:\n- The sequence of 7s in the input is preserved in the output.\n- The trailing 7s in the input are replaced with 0s in the output.\n- The first two 0s remain unchanged.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\nObservations:\n- The sequence of 1s in the input is preserved in the output.\n- The initial 1 in the input is replaced with 0 in the output.\n- The first six 0s remain unchanged.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nObservations:\n- The sequence of 1s in the input is preserved in the output.\n- The trailing 1 in the input is replaced with 0 in the output.\n- The first four 0s remain unchanged.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n1. Identify the longest contiguous sequence of non-zero numbers in the input.\n2. Preserve this sequence in the output.\n3. Replace any trailing non-zero numbers after this sequence with 0s.\n4. Keep the leading zeros unchanged.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 5 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0\n\nSteps:\n1. Identify the longest contiguous sequence of non-zero numbers: 5 5 5 (from index 12 to 14).\n2. Preserve this sequence in the output.\n3. Replace any trailing non-zero numbers after this sequence with 0s.\n4. Keep the leading zeros unchanged.\n\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0\n\nThus, the final output grid is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0>>>"
