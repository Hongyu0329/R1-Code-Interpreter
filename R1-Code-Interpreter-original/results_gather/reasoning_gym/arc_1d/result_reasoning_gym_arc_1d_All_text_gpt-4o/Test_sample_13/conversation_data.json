    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2 2 1 0 2 2 1 2 2 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 1 2 2 2 2 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 2 1 2\n- **Output:** 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 2 1 0 0 1 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 1\n- **Output:** 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n### Observations:\n1. **Output Pattern:** The output grid always starts with a sequence of '2's, followed by '0's, and ends with a sequence of '1's.\n2. **Count of '2's:** The number of '2's at the beginning of the output seems to be the total count of '2's in the input grid.\n3. **Count of '1's:** The number of '1's at the end of the output seems to be the total count of '1's in the input grid.\n4. **Count of '0's:** The number of '0's in the middle of the output is the remaining spaces after accounting for '2's and '1's.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\n- Count the number of '2's in the input grid. Place that many '2's at the start of the output grid.\n- Count the number of '1's in the input grid. Place that many '1's at the end of the output grid.\n- Fill the remaining spaces in the output grid with '0's.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 2 0 0 0 0\n- **Count of '2's:** 4\n- **Count of '1's:** 3\n- **Total Length of Grid:** 23\n- **Count of '0's:** 23 - 4 - 3 = 16\n\n### Constructing the Output:\n- Start with 4 '2's: 2 2 2 2\n- Follow with 16 '0's: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- End with 3 '1's: 1 1 1\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe output grid for the test input is:\n<<<2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1>>>"
