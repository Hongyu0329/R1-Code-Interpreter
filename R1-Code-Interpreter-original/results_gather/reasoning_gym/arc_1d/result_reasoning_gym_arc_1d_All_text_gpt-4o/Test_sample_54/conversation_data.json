    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence of 1s in the input starts at position 11 and ends at position 21.\n- In the output, the sequence of 1s is shifted to start at position 15 and end at position 25.\n- The sequence of 1s is shifted 4 positions to the right.\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence of 5s in the input starts at position 16 and ends at position 18.\n- In the output, the sequence of 5s is shifted to start at position 20 and end at position 22.\n- The sequence of 5s is shifted 4 positions to the right.\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence of 9s in the input starts at position 1 and ends at position 13.\n- In the output, the sequence of 9s is shifted to start at position 5 and end at position 17.\n- The sequence of 9s is shifted 4 positions to the right.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\nFrom the examples, we can deduce that the rule involves shifting any non-zero sequence 4 positions to the right. The zeros remain in place, and the non-zero sequence is moved to the right by 4 positions.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Process:**\n- Identify the sequence of 8s, which starts at position 13 and ends at position 16.\n- Shift this sequence 4 positions to the right, so it starts at position 17 and ends at position 20.\n\n**Output:**\n- The output grid will be: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
