    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0\n- **Output:** 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence of 3s in the input starts at the 6th position and ends at the 14th position.\n- In the output, the sequence of 3s starts at the 2nd position and ends at the 11th position.\n- The sequence of 3s is shifted 4 positions to the left.\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0\n- **Output:** 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence of 3s in the input starts at the 5th position and ends at the 13th position.\n- In the output, the sequence of 3s starts at the 1st position and ends at the 10th position.\n- The sequence of 3s is shifted 4 positions to the left.\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence of 3s in the input starts at the 9th position and ends at the 14th position.\n- In the output, the sequence of 3s starts at the 5th position and ends at the 10th position.\n- The sequence of 3s is shifted 4 positions to the left.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\nFrom the examples, we can deduce that the rule involves shifting the sequence of non-zero numbers (in this case, 3s) 4 positions to the left. The zeros at the beginning of the input are replaced by the shifted sequence, and the trailing zeros fill the remaining positions.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Identify the sequence of 1s: It starts at the 5th position and ends at the 15th position.\n2. Shift this sequence 4 positions to the left: The sequence of 1s will now start at the 1st position and end at the 11th position.\n3. Fill the remaining positions with zeros.\n\n**Output:**\n- The sequence of 1s is shifted to the left by 4 positions, resulting in the following output grid:\n\n<<<1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
