    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 5 0 8 8 0 4 0 8\n- **Output:** 0 0 5 0 5 5 0 5 0 5\n\nObservations:\n- The number 5 in the input remains unchanged in the output.\n- The number 8 in the input is changed to 5 in the output.\n- The number 4 in the input is changed to 5 in the output.\n- The number 0 remains unchanged.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 6 2 6 0 7 2 0 3 0\n- **Output:** 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 0\n\nObservations:\n- The number 6 in the input is changed to 5 in the output.\n- The number 2 in the input is changed to 5 in the output.\n- The number 7 in the input is changed to 5 in the output.\n- The number 3 in the input is changed to 5 in the output.\n- The number 0 remains unchanged.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 9 5 7 3 3 6 0 0 0 3\n- **Output:** 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 5\n\nObservations:\n- The number 9 in the input is changed to 5 in the output.\n- The number 5 in the input remains unchanged.\n- The number 7 in the input is changed to 5 in the output.\n- The number 3 in the input is changed to 5 in the output.\n- The number 6 in the input is changed to 5 in the output.\n- The number 0 remains unchanged.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\nFrom the analysis, we can derive the following rule:\n- Any non-zero number in the input grid is changed to 5 in the output grid.\n- The number 0 remains unchanged.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 8 0 7 9 7 0\n\nApplying the rule:\n- 0 remains 0\n- 8 changes to 5\n- 7 changes to 5\n- 9 changes to 5\n\nThus, the output grid is:\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 5 0 5 5 5 0\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 0 0 0 5 0 5 5 5 0>>>"
