    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 1 6 3 5 0 8 0 4 6 7 6 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 9 2 0 3 0 4 0 9 8\n- **Output:** 1 6 3 5 8 0 4 6 7 6 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 9 2 0 3 0 4 0 9 8 0\n\nObservations:\n- The input and output grids have the same numbers except for the position of zeros.\n- The zero at the 5th position in the input is replaced by the number 8 in the output.\n- The last number 8 in the input is replaced by 0 in the output.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 8 0 9 0 0 9 0 0 8 0 8 0 0 7 0 6 0 7 8 0 0 2 0 5 2\n- **Output:** 0 8 0 9 0 0 9 0 0 8 0 8 0 0 7 0 6 0 7 8 0 0 2 0 5 2 0\n\nObservations:\n- The first zero in the input is replaced by 8 in the output.\n- The last number 2 in the input is replaced by 0 in the output.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 9 0 0 4 0 1 2 0 0 3 7 8 0 0 0 0 2 7 6 9 4 0 0 9 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 9 0 4 0 1 2 0 0 3 7 8 0 0 0 0 2 7 6 9 4 0 0 9 0 0 0 0\n\nObservations:\n- The first zero in the input is replaced by 4 in the output.\n- The last number 0 in the input is replaced by 0 in the output.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n1. The first zero in the input grid is replaced by the first non-zero number that follows it in the input grid.\n2. The last number in the input grid is replaced by 0 in the output grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 5 2 0 0 0 3 0 8 5 0 0 0 0 0 2 8\n\nStep-by-step application:\n1. The first zero in the input is at position 2. The first non-zero number after this zero is 2 (at position 8).\n2. Replace the first zero with 2.\n3. The last number in the input is 8, which should be replaced by 0.\n\nThus, the output grid is:\n8 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 5 2 0 0 0 3 0 8 5 0 0 0 0 0 2 0\n\nFinal answer:\n<<<8 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 5 2 0 0 0 3 0 8 5 0 0 0 0 0 2 0>>>"
