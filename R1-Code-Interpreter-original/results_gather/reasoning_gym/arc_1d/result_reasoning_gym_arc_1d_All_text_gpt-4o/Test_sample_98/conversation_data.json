    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 4 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 4 4 4\n\nObservations:\n- The sequence \"1 1 1\" remains unchanged.\n- The number \"4\" is extended to \"4 4 4\".\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 1 1 1 1 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 9 0 9 9 9 9 0 9 9 9 9 0 1 1 1 1 0 2 2 2 2 0 2\n\nObservations:\n- The number \"9\" is extended to \"9 9 9 9\" and also appears at the start.\n- The sequence \"1 1 1 1\" remains unchanged.\n- The number \"2\" is extended to \"2 2 2 2\".\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0\n\nObservations:\n- The sequence \"1 1 1 1\" remains unchanged.\n- The number \"1\" is extended to \"1 1 1 1\".\n\n### Rule Derivation:\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rules:\n1. Any sequence of consecutive identical numbers (other than zero) in the input is extended to a longer sequence of the same number in the output.\n2. The length of the extension seems to be determined by the number itself, i.e., a number \"n\" is extended to \"n n n ... n\" (n times).\n3. If a number appears in isolation, it is extended to a sequence of that number repeated as many times as the number itself.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 7 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nApplying the rule:\n- The number \"7\" is extended to \"7 7 7 7 7 7 7\".\n- The sequence \"1 1 1\" remains unchanged.\n\nThus, the output grid should be:\n- **Output:** 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nFinal answer:\n<<<7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
