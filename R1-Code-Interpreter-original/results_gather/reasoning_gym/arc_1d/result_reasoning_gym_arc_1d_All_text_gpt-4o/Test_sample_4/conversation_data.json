    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 1 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 1 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0\n- **Observation:** The input and output are identical.\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 1 0 4 4 4 4 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 1 4 4 4 4 0 0\n- **Observation:** The sequence \"0 4 4 4 4 0\" in the input is transformed to \"4 4 4 4 0 0\" in the output. The '1' remains in place, and the zeros at the start are unchanged.\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n- **Output:** 0 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n- **Observation:** The input and output are identical.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- If the input grid contains a sequence of zeros followed by a non-zero number and then a sequence of the same non-zero number, the output grid will shift the non-zero sequence to the left, replacing the initial zero with the non-zero number and appending a zero at the end.\n- If the input grid does not follow this pattern, the output grid remains identical to the input grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 8 8 8 8 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n- **Analysis:** The input grid starts with a sequence of '8's followed by zeros, then a '1', and more zeros. According to the rule, the sequence of '8's should remain unchanged because it does not follow the pattern of zeros followed by a non-zero number and then a sequence of the same non-zero number.\n- **Output:** The grid remains unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the output for the test input is:\n\n<<<8 8 8 8 0 0 1 0 0 0 0>>>"
