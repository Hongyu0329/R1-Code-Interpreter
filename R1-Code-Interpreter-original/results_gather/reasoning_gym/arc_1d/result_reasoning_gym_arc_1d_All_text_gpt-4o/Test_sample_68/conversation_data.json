    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0\n\n**Observation:** \n- The sequence of 7s in the input starts at position 5 and ends at position 19.\n- In the output, the sequence of 7s starts at position 8 and ends at position 22.\n- The sequence of 7s is shifted 3 positions to the right in the output.\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n- **Output:** 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n\n**Observation:**\n- The entire grid is filled with 7s in both input and output.\n- No shift is needed as there are no leading or trailing zeros.\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence of 9s in the input starts at position 3 and ends at position 19.\n- In the output, the sequence of 9s starts at position 6 and ends at position 22.\n- The sequence of 9s is shifted 3 positions to the right in the output.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n- Shift this sequence 3 positions to the right in the output grid.\n- Maintain the length of the sequence and fill the remaining positions with zeros.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers: 8 8 8 8 (starting at position 2 and ending at position 5).\n2. Shift this sequence 3 positions to the right: The sequence will start at position 5 and end at position 8 in the output.\n3. Fill the remaining positions with zeros.\n\n**Output:**\n0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
