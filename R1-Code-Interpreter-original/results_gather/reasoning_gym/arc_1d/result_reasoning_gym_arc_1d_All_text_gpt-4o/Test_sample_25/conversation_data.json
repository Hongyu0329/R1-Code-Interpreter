    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:** The number '9' in the input is shifted one position to the right in the output.\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 7 7 1 3 9 6 7 7 2 8 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 7 7 1 3 9 6 7 7 2 8 0\n\n**Observation:** The sequence '5 7 7 1 3 9 6 7 7 2 8' is shifted two positions to the right in the output.\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 3 3 3 7 9 3 7 9 3 7 6 9 9 4 4 5 7 4 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 3 3 3 7 9 3 7 9 3 7 6 9 9 4 4 5 7 4\n\n**Observation:** The sequence '3 3 3 7 9 3 7 9 3 7 6 9 9 4 4 5 7 4' is shifted three positions to the right in the output.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\nFrom the examples, we can deduce that the rule involves shifting the non-zero sequence to the right by a number of positions equal to the number of leading zeros in the input. Specifically:\n- Count the number of leading zeros in the input.\n- Shift the non-zero sequence to the right by that number of positions.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 1 8 8 1 7 1 6 8 9 1 8 9 1 5 0 0 0 0\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Count the leading zeros: There are 3 leading zeros.\n2. Shift the non-zero sequence '1 8 8 1 7 1 6 8 9 1 8 9 1 5' three positions to the right.\n\n**Resulting Output:**\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 8 8 1 7 1 6 8 9 1 8 9 1 5 0\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 1 8 8 1 7 1 6 8 9 1 8 9 1 5 0>>>"
