    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze each example step by step:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 8 8 2 2 2 0 0 0 8 8 8 2 2 2 2 0 0 0\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. The input grid is a sequence of numbers, and the output grid is a transformation of this sequence.\n2. The first two numbers in the input (2, 2) are transformed into (8, 8) in the output.\n3. The next three numbers (2, 2, 2) remain unchanged in the output.\n4. The next three numbers (0, 0, 0) also remain unchanged.\n5. The next two numbers (2, 2) are transformed into (8, 8).\n6. The next three numbers (2, 2, 2) are transformed into (8, 8, 8).\n7. The final sequence (2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0) remains unchanged.\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 8 2 2 0 0 8 8 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. The first number (0) remains unchanged.\n2. The next two numbers (2, 2) are transformed into (8, 8).\n3. The next two numbers (2, 2) remain unchanged.\n4. The next two numbers (0, 0) remain unchanged.\n5. The next two numbers (2, 2) are transformed into (8, 8).\n6. The next three numbers (2, 2, 2) remain unchanged.\n7. The final sequence (0, 0, 0, 0, 0) remains unchanged.\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 8 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 2 2 2\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. The first three numbers (0, 0, 0) remain unchanged.\n2. The next number (2) is transformed into (8).\n3. The next two numbers (2, 2) remain unchanged.\n4. The next six numbers (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) remain unchanged.\n5. The next number (2) is transformed into (8).\n6. The next two numbers (2, 2) are transformed into (8, 8).\n7. The final sequence (2, 2, 2) remains unchanged.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\nFrom the analysis, we can deduce the following rule:\n- Whenever a sequence of two or more consecutive '2's appears, the first two '2's are transformed into '8's.\n- If there are more than two consecutive '2's, the remaining '2's after the first two are left unchanged.\n- Any '0's or other numbers remain unchanged.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Transformation:**\n1. The first two numbers (2, 2) are transformed into (8, 8).\n2. The next three numbers (2, 2, 2) remain unchanged after the first two are transformed.\n3. The next two numbers (0, 0) remain unchanged.\n4. The next two numbers (2, 2) are transformed into (8, 8).\n5. The next number (2) remains unchanged.\n6. The final sequence (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) remains unchanged.\n\n**Output:**\n- **Output:** 8 8 2 2 2 0 0 8 8 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<8 8 2 2 2 0 0 8 8 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
