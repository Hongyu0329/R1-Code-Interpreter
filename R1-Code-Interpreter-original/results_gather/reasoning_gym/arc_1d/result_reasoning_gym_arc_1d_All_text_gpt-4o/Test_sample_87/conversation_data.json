    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 1 2 1 2 0 0 2 2\n- **Output:** 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nObservations:\n1. The output starts with a sequence of '2's, which matches the number of '2's in the input.\n2. The sequence of '2's is followed by '1's, which matches the number of '1's in the input.\n3. The rest of the output is filled with '0's.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 2 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 2 1 0\n- **Output:** 2 2 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nObservations:\n1. The output starts with two '2's, which matches the number of '2's in the input.\n2. The sequence of '2's is followed by four '1's, which matches the number of '1's in the input.\n3. The rest of the output is filled with '0's.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 1 1 2 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 1\n- **Output:** 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nObservations:\n1. The output starts with three '2's, which matches the number of '2's in the input.\n2. The sequence of '2's is followed by four '1's, which matches the number of '1's in the input.\n3. The rest of the output is filled with '0's.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\nFrom the analysis of the examples, the rule can be derived as follows:\n1. Count the number of '2's in the input grid.\n2. Count the number of '1's in the input grid.\n3. Construct the output grid by placing the counted number of '2's first, followed by the counted number of '1's, and fill the rest with '0's.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 0 1 0 0 2 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 2 0\n\nStep-by-step application:\n1. Count the number of '2's: There are 2 '2's.\n2. Count the number of '1's: There are 5 '1's.\n3. Construct the output:\n   - Start with two '2's: 2 2\n   - Follow with five '1's: 2 2 1 1 1 1 1\n   - Fill the rest with '0's to match the input length: 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThus, the output for the test input is:\n\n<<<2 2 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
