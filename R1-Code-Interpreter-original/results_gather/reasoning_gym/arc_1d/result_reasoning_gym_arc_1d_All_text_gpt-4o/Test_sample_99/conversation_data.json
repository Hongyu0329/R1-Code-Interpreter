    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 2 8 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 2 2 5 0\n- **Output:** 0 2 8 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 2 2 5\n\n**Observation:** \n- The first element of the input (2) is moved to the second position in the output.\n- The second element of the input (8) is moved to the third position in the output.\n- The rest of the elements are shifted to the right by two positions.\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 3 0 0 0 0 4 2 7 5 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 9 6 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 4 2 7 5 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 9 6 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The first element of the input (0) is moved to the second position in the output.\n- The second element of the input (3) is moved to the third position in the output.\n- The rest of the elements are shifted to the right by two positions.\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 5 0 6 4 1 4 6 1 0 0 3 0 8 2 0 0 2 0 6 8 0\n- **Output:** 0 5 0 6 4 1 4 6 1 0 0 3 0 8 2 0 0 2 0 6 8\n\n**Observation:**\n- The first element of the input (5) is moved to the second position in the output.\n- The second element of the input (0) is moved to the third position in the output.\n- The rest of the elements are shifted to the right by two positions.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- The first element of the input is moved to the second position in the output.\n- The second element of the input is moved to the third position in the output.\n- All other elements are shifted to the right by two positions.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 4 0 9 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 1 0 6 0 0 0 9 0\n\nApplying the rule:\n- Move the first element (0) to the second position.\n- Move the second element (0) to the third position.\n- Shift the rest of the elements to the right by two positions.\n\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 4 0 9 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 1 0 6 0 0 0 9\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 4 0 9 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 1 0 6 0 0 0 9>>>"
