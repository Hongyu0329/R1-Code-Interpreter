    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 6 2 6 2 5 5 8 6 8 5 7 1 7 8 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 7 1 7 5 8 6 8 5 5 2 6 2 6 9 0 0\n\nObservations:\n- The first and last 10 elements remain unchanged.\n- The middle section (11th to 26th elements) is reversed.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 3 5 6 2 8 5 1 4 6 7 1 1 1 4 4 2 1 1 8 5 1 8 4 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 4 8 1 5 8 1 1 2 4 4 1 1 1 7 6 4 1 5 8 2 6 5 3 0 0 0 0\n\nObservations:\n- The first and last 10 elements remain unchanged.\n- The middle section (11th to 26th elements) is reversed.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 3 3 5 6 2 7 2 4 6 6 6 1 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 8 1 6 6 6 4 2 7 2 6 5 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nObservations:\n- The first and last 10 elements remain unchanged.\n- The middle section (11th to 26th elements) is reversed.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\nFrom the analysis of the examples, the rule can be summarized as:\n1. The first 10 elements and the last 10 elements of the grid remain unchanged.\n2. The middle section of the grid (11th to 26th elements) is reversed.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nFollowing the rule:\n- The first 10 elements: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- The middle section (11th to 26th elements): 3 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0, reversed becomes 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 3\n- The last 10 elements: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Final Answer:\nCombining these, the output grid is:\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
