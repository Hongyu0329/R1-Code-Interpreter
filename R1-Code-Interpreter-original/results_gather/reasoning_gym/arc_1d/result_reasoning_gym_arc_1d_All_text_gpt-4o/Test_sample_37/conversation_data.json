    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 6 6 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 6 6 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence of non-zero numbers (6, 6, 9) in the input is shifted one position to the right in the output.\n- The zero at the start of the input is replaced by a zero at the start of the output, and the sequence starts from the second position.\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 7 8 9 6 9 9 8 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 7 8 9 6 9 9 8 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence of non-zero numbers (7, 8, 9, 6, 9, 9, 8) is shifted one position to the right in the output.\n- The zeros at the start of the input are maintained, and the sequence starts from the fourth position in the input, but from the fifth position in the output.\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 2 7 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 2 7 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence of non-zero numbers (7, 2, 7) is shifted one position to the right in the output.\n- The zeros at the start of the input are maintained, and the sequence starts from the seventh position in the input, but from the eighth position in the output.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n- Shift this sequence one position to the right in the output grid.\n- Maintain the zeros at the start of the input grid, and ensure the sequence starts one position later in the output grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 0 4 3 5 4 9 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers: 4, 3, 5, 4, 9.\n2. Shift this sequence one position to the right in the output.\n3. Maintain the zeros at the start of the input grid.\n\n**Output:**\n- The sequence starts from the third position in the input, so it should start from the fourth position in the output.\n\nThus, the output grid is:\n<<<0 0 0 4 3 5 4 9 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
