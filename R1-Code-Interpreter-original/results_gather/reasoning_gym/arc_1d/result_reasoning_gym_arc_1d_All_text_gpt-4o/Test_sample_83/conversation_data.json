    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 2 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n- **Output:** 2 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nObservations:\n- The first four elements of the output are non-zero: 2, 2, 1, 1.\n- These numbers seem to be derived from the non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n- The input has two '2's and two '1's, which are reflected in the output.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2 2\n- **Output:** 2 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nObservations:\n- The first four elements of the output are 2, 2, 2, 1.\n- The input has three '2's and one '1', which are reflected in the output.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 2 1 0 2 0 0 1 2 1 0 2 2 2\n- **Output:** 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nObservations:\n- The first nine elements of the output are 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1.\n- The input has six '2's and three '1's, which are reflected in the output.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\nFrom the analysis, the rule appears to be:\n- Count the number of '2's and '1's in the input grid.\n- Place all '2's first in the output grid, followed by all '1's.\n- The rest of the output grid is filled with '0's.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 2 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2 1 1\n\nCount the numbers:\n- '2's: 3 occurrences\n- '1's: 4 occurrences\n\nConstruct the output:\n- First, place three '2's: 2, 2, 2\n- Then, place four '1's: 1, 1, 1, 1\n- Fill the rest with '0's to make a 16-element grid.\n\n### Final Output:\nThe output grid based on the derived rule is:\n<<<2 2 2 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
