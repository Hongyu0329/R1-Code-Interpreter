    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 7 0 0 9 9 9 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 7 0 0 9 9 9 0 3 1 1 3 0 3 2 2 3 0 0 0\n\nObservations:\n1. The numbers 7, 9, 1, and 2 remain unchanged.\n2. The number 3 is inserted at specific positions: after the sequence of 9s, after the sequence of 1s, and after the sequence of 2s.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 3 7 7 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 6 6 3 0\n\nObservations:\n1. The numbers 7 and 6 remain unchanged.\n2. The number 3 is inserted before the sequence of 7s, after the sequence of 7s, and after the sequence of 6s.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 9 9 0 0 1 1 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 3 9 9 3 3 1 1 3 0 0\n\nObservations:\n1. The numbers 4, 6, 9, and 1 remain unchanged.\n2. The number 3 is inserted before the sequence of 9s, after the sequence of 9s, and after the sequence of 1s.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- The number 3 is inserted at the boundaries of sequences of non-zero numbers. Specifically:\n  - Before the first non-zero sequence (if it is not at the start of the grid).\n  - After each sequence of non-zero numbers.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 5 5\n\nSteps:\n1. Identify sequences of non-zero numbers: 6 6 6, 6, and 5 5.\n2. Insert 3 before the first sequence of 6s (since it is not at the start of the grid).\n3. Insert 3 after the sequence of 6 6 6.\n4. Insert 3 after the single 6.\n5. Insert 3 after the sequence of 5 5.\n\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 3 6 6 6 3 0 0 0 0 3 6 3 0 0 3 5 5 3\n\nThus, the final output grid is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 3 6 6 6 3 0 0 0 0 3 6 3 0 0 3 5 5 3>>>"
