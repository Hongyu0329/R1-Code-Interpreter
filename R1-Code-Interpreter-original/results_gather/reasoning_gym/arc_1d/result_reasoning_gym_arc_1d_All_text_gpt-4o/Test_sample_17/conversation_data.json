    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The sequence of 6s in the input starts at the 8th position and ends at the 20th position.\n- In the output, the sequence of 6s starts at the 7th position and ends at the 19th position.\n- The sequence of 6s is shifted one position to the left, and a 0 is added at the end.\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\n- **Output:** 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The sequence of 1s in the input starts at the 2nd position and ends at the 19th position.\n- In the output, the sequence of 1s starts at the 1st position and ends at the 18th position.\n- The sequence of 1s is shifted one position to the left, and a 0 is added at the end.\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The sequence of 3s in the input starts at the 12th position and ends at the 13th position.\n- In the output, the sequence of 3s starts at the 11th position and ends at the 12th position.\n- The sequence of 3s is shifted one position to the left, and a 0 is added at the end.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\nFrom the analysis of the examples, the rule can be summarized as follows:\n- Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n- Shift this sequence one position to the left in the output grid.\n- Add a 0 at the end of the output grid to maintain the same length as the input grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n- The sequence of 1s starts at the 2nd position and ends at the 16th position.\n- Shift this sequence one position to the left, starting at the 1st position and ending at the 15th position.\n- Add a 0 at the end.\n\n**Output:**\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
