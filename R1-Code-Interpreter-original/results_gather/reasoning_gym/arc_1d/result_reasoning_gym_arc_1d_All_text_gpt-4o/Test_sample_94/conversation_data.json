    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 4 3 8 8 4 3 3 8 2 5 9 3 6 4 8 7 1 7 7 5 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 3 8 8 4 3 3 8 2 5 9 3 6 4 8 7 1 7 7 5 0\n\n**Observation:** The first seven elements of the input are replaced with zeros in the output.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 1 2 5 3 4 4 7 7 4 7 1 4 7 4 1 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 1 2 5 3 4 4 7 7 4 7 1 4 7 4 1 0\n\n**Observation:** The first eleven elements of the input are replaced with zeros in the output.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 3 4 3 7 1 6 2 3 8 6 8 7 7 9 5 1 6 1 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 4 3 7 1 6 2 3 8 6 8 7 7 9 5 1 6 1 0\n\n**Observation:** The first nine elements of the input are replaced with zeros in the output.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\nFrom the examples, we observe that a certain number of leading elements in the input grid are replaced with zeros in the output grid. The number of leading zeros in the output seems to be increasing with each example.\n\n- In Example 1, the first 7 elements are zeros.\n- In Example 2, the first 11 elements are zeros.\n- In Example 3, the first 9 elements are zeros.\n\nThe pattern suggests that the number of leading zeros in the output is determined by the position of the first non-zero element in the input grid. The output grid has zeros up to and including the position of the first non-zero element in the input grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 8 3 3 1 9 2 5 7 5 2 9 2 8 3 2 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe first non-zero element in the test input is at position 3 (0-indexed), which is the number 8. Therefore, the first 3 elements in the output should be zeros.\n\n### Test Output:\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 8 3 3 1 9 2 5 7 5 2 9 2 8 3 2 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 8 3 3 1 9 2 5 7 5 2 9 2 8 3 2 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
