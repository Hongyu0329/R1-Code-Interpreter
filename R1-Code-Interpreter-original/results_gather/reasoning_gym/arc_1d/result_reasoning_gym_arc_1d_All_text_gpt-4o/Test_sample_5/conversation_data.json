    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0\n\nObservations:\n- The sequence of 6s in the input starts at the 8th position and ends at the 26th position.\n- In the output, the sequence of 6s starts at the 4th position and ends at the 25th position.\n- The sequence of 6s is shifted left by 4 positions, and the trailing 6s are replaced by 0s.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nObservations:\n- The sequence of 2s in the input starts at the 7th position and ends at the 19th position.\n- In the output, the sequence of 2s starts at the 3rd position and ends at the 17th position.\n- The sequence of 2s is shifted left by 4 positions, and the trailing 2s are replaced by 0s.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nObservations:\n- The sequence of 5s in the input starts at the 5th position and ends at the 25th position.\n- In the output, the sequence of 5s starts at the 1st position and ends at the 21st position.\n- The sequence of 5s is shifted left by 4 positions, and the trailing 5s are replaced by 0s.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\nFrom the analysis of the examples, we can derive the following rule:\n- Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n- Shift this sequence 4 positions to the left.\n- Replace the trailing positions with 0s to maintain the original grid length.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSteps:\n1. Identify the sequence of 7s starting at the 6th position and ending at the 17th position.\n2. Shift this sequence 4 positions to the left, starting at the 2nd position.\n3. Replace the trailing positions with 0s.\n\n- **Test Output:** 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
