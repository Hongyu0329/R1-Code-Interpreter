    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 1 1 5 3 1 0 3 5 9 8 7 8\n- **Output:** 1 5 3 1 0 3 5 9 8 7 8 1\n\n**Observation:** The first element of the input (1) is moved to the end of the output.\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 9 3 6 4 1 2 5 6 1 6 2 2\n- **Output:** 3 6 4 1 2 5 6 1 6 2 2 9\n\n**Observation:** The first element of the input (9) is moved to the end of the output.\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 8 2 1 7 3 6 2 2 5 5 2 5\n- **Output:** 2 1 7 3 6 2 2 5 5 2 5 8\n\n**Observation:** The first element of the input (8) is moved to the end of the output.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\nFrom the examples, we can deduce a consistent rule:\n- The first element of the input grid is removed from the start and appended to the end of the output grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 7 9 6 4 0 0 0 8 7 1 3 5\n\nFollowing the rule:\n1. Remove the first element (7) from the input.\n2. Append this element (7) to the end of the remaining sequence.\n\n- **Test Output:** 9 6 4 0 0 0 8 7 1 3 5 7\n\nThus, the output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<9 6 4 0 0 0 8 7 1 3 5 7>>>"
