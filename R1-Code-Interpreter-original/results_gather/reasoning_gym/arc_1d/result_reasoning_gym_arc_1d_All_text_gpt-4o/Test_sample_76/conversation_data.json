    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 5 5 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 5 5\n- **Output:** 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 5\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence of numbers in the input is shifted to the right by one position.\n- The zero in the input grid moves one position to the right in the output grid.\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence of numbers in the input is shifted to the right by one position.\n- The zeros at the beginning of the input grid are shifted to the right, and the zero at the end of the input grid moves to the second last position in the output grid.\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence of numbers in the input is shifted to the right by one position.\n- The zeros at the beginning of the input grid are shifted to the right, and the zero at the end of the input grid moves to the second last position in the output grid.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- The entire sequence of numbers in the input grid is shifted to the right by one position in the output grid.\n- The last element of the input grid moves to the second last position in the output grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6\n\n**Applying the Rule:**\n- Shift the entire sequence to the right by one position.\n- Move the last element (6) to the second last position.\n\n**Output:**\n- The output grid will be: 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
