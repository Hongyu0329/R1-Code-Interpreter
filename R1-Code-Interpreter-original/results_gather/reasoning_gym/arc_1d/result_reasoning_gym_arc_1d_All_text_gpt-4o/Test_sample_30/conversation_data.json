    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 6 3 9 0\n- **Output:** 3 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 6\n\n**Observation:**\n- The non-zero elements in the input are 5, 6, 3, and 9.\n- In the output, these elements appear as 3, 9, 5, and 6.\n- The non-zero elements are shifted to the left, with the first two elements (3 and 9) moved to the start of the output, and the remaining elements (5 and 6) moved to the end.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 1 5 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 1 5 3 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The non-zero elements in the input are 1, 5, and 3.\n- In the output, these elements appear in the same order but shifted to the right, starting from the 6th position.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The non-zero elements in the input are 8 and 8.\n- In the output, these elements appear in the same order but shifted to the right, starting from the 4th position.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n1. Identify all non-zero elements in the input grid.\n2. Shift these non-zero elements to the right within the output grid, maintaining their order.\n3. The position to start placing these elements seems to be determined by the number of zeros at the start of the input grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 6 3 4 2 6 9 8 1 7 0 0 0\n- Non-zero elements: 6, 3, 4, 2, 6, 9, 8, 1, 7\n- There are no leading zeros in the input, so the non-zero elements should start from the beginning of the output grid.\n\nThus, the output grid should be the same as the input grid since there are no leading zeros to shift past.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n<<<6 3 4 2 6 9 8 1 7 0 0 0>>>"
