    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 9 2 7 4 7 7 4 3 2 6 3 8 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 9 2 7 4 7 7 4 3 2 6 3 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The first four zeros in the input are removed in the output.\n- The sequence starting from the first non-zero number (9) in the input is retained in the output.\n- The output ends with additional zeros to make the total length of the output equal to the input length plus one.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 1 2 2 8 7 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 8 1 2 2 8 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The leading zeros in the input are reduced to the zeros that appear before the first non-zero number (8).\n- The sequence starting from the first non-zero number (8) is retained.\n- The output ends with additional zeros to make the total length of the output equal to the input length plus one.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 2 8 5 1 3 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 8 2 8 5 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The leading zeros in the input are reduced to the zeros that appear before the first non-zero number (8).\n- The sequence starting from the first non-zero number (8) is retained.\n- The output ends with additional zeros to make the total length of the output equal to the input length plus one.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\n1. Identify the first non-zero number in the input grid.\n2. Retain all numbers from this first non-zero number to the end of the input grid.\n3. Add zeros to the end of this sequence to make the total length of the output grid equal to the input grid length plus one.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 6 3 5 1 7 9 1 2 4 9 6 3 2 0 0\n- **First non-zero number:** 6\n- **Retained sequence:** 6 3 5 1 7 9 1 2 4 9 6 3 2 0 0\n- **Output length:** 19 (input length) + 1 = 20\n- **Final Output:** 6 3 5 1 7 9 1 2 4 9 6 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThus, the predicted output grid is:\n\n<<<6 3 5 1 7 9 1 2 4 9 6 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
