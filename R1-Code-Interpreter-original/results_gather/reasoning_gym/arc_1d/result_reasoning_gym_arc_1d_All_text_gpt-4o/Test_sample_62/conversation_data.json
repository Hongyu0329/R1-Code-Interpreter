    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 8 8 0 0 1 1 0 0 8 8 0 0 7 0 0\n- **Output:** 8 8 3 3 1 1 3 3 8 8 3 0 7 0 0\n\nObservations:\n1. The first two numbers (8, 8) remain unchanged.\n2. The next two zeros (0, 0) are replaced by 3s.\n3. The next two numbers (1, 1) remain unchanged.\n4. The next two zeros (0, 0) are replaced by 3s.\n5. The next two numbers (8, 8) remain unchanged.\n6. The next zero (0) is replaced by 3.\n7. The number 7 remains unchanged.\n8. The last two numbers (0, 0) remain unchanged.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 6 6 0 0\n- **Output:** 1 0 0 0 0 3 1 1 3 0 3 6 6 3 0\n\nObservations:\n1. The first number (1) remains unchanged.\n2. The next four zeros (0, 0, 0, 0) remain unchanged.\n3. The next zero (0) is replaced by 3.\n4. The next two numbers (1, 1) remain unchanged.\n5. The next zero (0) is replaced by 3.\n6. The next zero (0) remains unchanged.\n7. The next two numbers (6, 6) remain unchanged.\n8. The next zero (0) is replaced by 3.\n9. The last zero (0) remains unchanged.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 5 5 0 0 2 2 0 0 6 0 0 0 1 1 0\n- **Output:** 5 5 3 3 2 2 3 0 6 0 0 3 1 1 3\n\nObservations:\n1. The first two numbers (5, 5) remain unchanged.\n2. The next two zeros (0, 0) are replaced by 3s.\n3. The next two numbers (2, 2) remain unchanged.\n4. The next zero (0) is replaced by 3.\n5. The next zero (0) remains unchanged.\n6. The number 6 remains unchanged.\n7. The next zero (0) remains unchanged.\n8. The next zero (0) is replaced by 3.\n9. The next two numbers (1, 1) remain unchanged.\n10. The last zero (0) is replaced by 3.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\nFrom the analysis, the rule seems to be:\n- Replace every second zero (0) with a 3, starting from the first zero encountered in the sequence.\n- All other numbers remain unchanged.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 4 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 9 9 9 0 0 0 0\n\nApplying the rule:\n1. The first number (4) remains unchanged.\n2. The first zero (0) remains unchanged.\n3. The second zero (0) is replaced by 3.\n4. The next two numbers (5, 5) remain unchanged.\n5. The next zero (0) remains unchanged.\n6. The next zero (0) is replaced by 3.\n7. The next zero (0) remains unchanged.\n8. The next three numbers (9, 9, 9) remain unchanged.\n9. The next zero (0) is replaced by 3.\n10. The next zero (0) remains unchanged.\n11. The next zero (0) is replaced by 3.\n12. The last zero (0) remains unchanged.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe output grid for the test input is:\n<<<4 0 3 5 5 0 3 0 9 9 9 3 0 3 0>>>"
