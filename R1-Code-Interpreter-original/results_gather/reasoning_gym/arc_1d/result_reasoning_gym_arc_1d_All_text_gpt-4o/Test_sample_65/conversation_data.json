    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\n\n**Observation:** \n- The sequence of 1s in the input is shifted one position to the left in the output.\n- The trailing 0 in the input becomes a leading 0 in the output.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence of 1s in the input is shifted one position to the left in the output.\n- The trailing 0 in the input becomes a leading 0 in the output.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence of 1s in the input is shifted one position to the left in the output.\n- The trailing 0 in the input becomes a leading 0 in the output.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\nFrom the analysis of the examples, the rule can be summarized as:\n- Shift the sequence of non-zero numbers (in this case, 1s) one position to the left.\n- The trailing zero in the input becomes a leading zero in the output.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Applying the Rule:**\n- Shift the sequence of 8s one position to the left.\n- The trailing zero in the input becomes a leading zero in the output.\n\n**Test Output:** 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
