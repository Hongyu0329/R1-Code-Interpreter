    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 1 1 5 4 7 4 5 5 7 1 6 5 9 2 7 2 2 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 1 1 5 4 7 4 5 5 7 1 6 5 9 2 7 2 2 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:** The first three elements of the input (0, 1, 1) are replaced by zeros in the output. The rest of the elements are shifted to the right by three positions.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:** The first 15 elements of the input are zeros, and the output remains the same until the 16th position, where the 3 is shifted to the right by one position.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 7 5 2 9 2 5 2 5 6 9 1 5 4 7 5 7 4 1 5 3 4 4 8 4 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 7 5 2 9 2 5 2 5 6 9 1 5 4 7 5 7 4 1 5 3 4 4 8 4 0\n\n**Observation:** The first three elements of the input (0, 0, 7) are replaced by zeros in the output. The rest of the elements are shifted to the right by three positions.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\nFrom the examples, the rule can be deduced as follows:\n- The first three non-zero elements in the input are replaced by zeros in the output.\n- The remaining elements are shifted to the right by the number of zeros added at the beginning.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 2 8 9 4 2 5 4 7 7 2 9 7 0 0 0\n\n**Step-by-step Application:**\n1. Identify the first three non-zero elements: 3, 2, 8.\n2. Replace these with zeros: 0, 0, 0.\n3. Shift the remaining elements to the right by three positions.\n\n**Test Output:**\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 2 8 9 4 2 5 4 7 7 2 9 7\n\nThus, the final output grid is:\n\n<<<answer>>> 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 2 8 9 4 2 5 4 7 7 2 9 7 <<<answer>>>"
