    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 3 9 6 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 8 9 9\n- **Output:** 9 9 3 9 6 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 8\n\n**Observation:** \n- The first three numbers in the input (3, 9, 6) are rearranged to (9, 9, 3) in the output.\n- The rest of the numbers remain unchanged except for the last two numbers (9, 9) which are shifted to the end of the output.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 2 5 7 5 9 8 1 7 5 6 9 4 2 1 6\n- **Output:** 1 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 2 5 7 5 9 8 1 7 5 6 9 4 2\n\n**Observation:**\n- The last two numbers in the input (1, 6) are moved to the start of the output.\n- The rest of the numbers are shifted to the right by two positions.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 2 2 3 2 2 6 1 1 0 4 2 6 2 6 4 9 5 6 1 6 9 5 9 7 7 3 2 1 6 9\n- **Output:** 6 9 2 2 3 2 2 6 1 1 0 4 2 6 2 6 4 9 5 6 1 6 9 5 9 7 7 3 2 1\n\n**Observation:**\n- The last two numbers in the input (6, 9) are moved to the start of the output.\n- The rest of the numbers are shifted to the right by two positions.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\nFrom the analysis of the examples, the rule can be summarized as follows:\n- Take the last two numbers from the input grid.\n- Move these two numbers to the start of the output grid.\n- Shift the remaining numbers in the input grid to the right by two positions to fill the rest of the output grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 4 4 7 8 8 6 9 8 5 8 2 1 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Last two numbers:** 0, 0\n- **Output:** Start with 0, 0 and shift the rest of the input to the right by two positions.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 4 4 7 8 8 6 9 8 5 8 2 1 8 0 0>>>"
