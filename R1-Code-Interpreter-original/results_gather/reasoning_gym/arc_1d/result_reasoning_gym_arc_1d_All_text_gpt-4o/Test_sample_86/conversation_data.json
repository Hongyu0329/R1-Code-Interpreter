    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 1 5 6 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 1 5 6\n\n**Observation:** The output grid is a shifted version of the input grid. The non-zero elements from the input grid are shifted to the right, and zeros are filled in from the left.\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:** The single non-zero element (9) is moved to the start of the output grid, and the rest are zeros.\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 3 9 1 4 3 7 5 2 1 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 9 3 9 1 4 3 7 5 2 1 9 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:** The non-zero elements are shifted to the right, and zeros are filled in from the left. The last non-zero element (9) in the input is moved to the fourth position in the output.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\nFrom the examples, the rule appears to be:\n1. Identify all non-zero elements in the input grid.\n2. Shift these non-zero elements to the right in the output grid.\n3. Fill the remaining positions on the left with zeros.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 8 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 7 2 8 4 5 1 8 2\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Identify non-zero elements: 8, 1, 2, 8, 7, 2, 8, 4, 5, 1, 8, 2.\n2. Shift these elements to the right in the output grid.\n3. Fill the remaining positions on the left with zeros.\n\n**Test Output:**\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 1 2 8 7 2 8 4 5 1 8 2\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 1 2 8 7 2 8 4 5 1 8 2>>>"
