    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence of four '6's in the input grid is shifted to the right by three positions in the output grid.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0\n- **Output:** 6 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence of '6's in the input grid is shifted to the left by three positions in the output grid, and the first '6' is moved to the start of the grid.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The single '7' in the input grid is shifted to the right by three positions in the output grid.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- Identify the non-zero sequence in the input grid.\n- Shift this sequence to the right by three positions in the output grid.\n- If the sequence is at the end of the grid, wrap around to the start.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Identify the non-zero sequence: 9 9 and 9 at the end.\n2. Shift this sequence to the right by three positions.\n3. The sequence becomes: 0 0 0 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9\n\nThus, the output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9>>>"
