    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 2 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 2 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:** The first seven elements remain unchanged as zeros. The eighth element (6) in the input becomes zero in the output. The rest of the elements (2, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) are shifted one position to the left.\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 6 9 7 7 3 1 2 2 7 3 2 3 9 8 3 7 9 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 6 9 7 7 3 1 2 2 7 3 2 3 9 8 3 7 9\n\n**Observation:** The first element (0) remains unchanged. The second element (6) in the input becomes zero in the output. The rest of the elements (9, 7, 7, 3, 1, 2, 2, 7, 3, 2, 3, 9, 8, 3, 7, 9, 0) are shifted one position to the left.\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 7 2 1 1 3 1 3 5 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 7 2 1 1 3 1 3 5\n\n**Observation:** The first nine elements remain unchanged as zeros. The tenth element (3) in the input becomes zero in the output. The rest of the elements (7, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 5, 0) are shifted one position to the left.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n1. Identify the first non-zero element in the input grid.\n2. Replace this first non-zero element with zero in the output grid.\n3. Shift all subsequent elements one position to the left.\n4. The remaining elements at the end of the grid are filled with zeros.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 9 2 1 2 8 6 6 9 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Step-by-step Application:**\n1. The first non-zero element is 9 (at the second position).\n2. Replace 9 with 0 in the output.\n3. Shift all subsequent elements (2, 1, 2, 8, 6, 6, 9, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) one position to the left.\n4. The final output grid is: 0 0 2 1 2 8 6 6 9 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThus, the output for the test input is:\n\n<<<0 0 2 1 2 8 6 6 9 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
