    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 1 1 1 1 2 1 0 0 1 2 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2\n\nObservations:\n- The output grid starts with a series of zeros.\n- The sequence of ones in the input grid appears in the output grid but shifted to the right.\n- The twos in the input grid appear at the end of the output grid.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 1 2 0 1 1 0 0 0 2 1 0 0 2 2 2 1 1 2 2\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nObservations:\n- The output grid starts with a series of zeros.\n- The sequence of ones in the input grid appears in the output grid but shifted to the right.\n- The twos in the input grid appear at the end of the output grid.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 2 2 0 0 1 0 2 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 1 1 2 1 0 0 0 2 2\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nObservations:\n- The output grid starts with a series of zeros.\n- The sequence of ones in the input grid appears in the output grid but shifted to the right.\n- The twos in the input grid appear at the end of the output grid.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\nFrom the analysis, the rule can be derived as follows:\n1. Count the number of zeros in the input grid and place them at the beginning of the output grid.\n2. Count the number of ones in the input grid and place them after the zeros in the output grid.\n3. Count the number of twos in the input grid and place them at the end of the output grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 2 0 2 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 2 1 0 0 1 1 0 2 0 0 0 0\n\n1. Count of zeros: 13\n2. Count of ones: 6\n3. Count of twos: 7\n\n### Constructing the Output:\n- Start with 13 zeros.\n- Follow with 6 ones.\n- End with 7 twos.\n\nThus, the output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<answer>>> 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 <<<answer>>>"
