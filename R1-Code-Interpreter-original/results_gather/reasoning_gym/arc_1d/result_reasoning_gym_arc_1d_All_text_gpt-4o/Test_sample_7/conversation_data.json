    "To find the common rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n- **Output:** 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The input starts with five 0s, followed by thirteen 4s.\n- The output starts with two 0s, followed by thirteen 4s, and ends with three 0s.\n- The 4s are shifted two positions to the left, and the 0s are adjusted accordingly.\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1\n- **Output:** 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The input starts with six 1s, followed by ten 0s, and ends with two 1s.\n- The output starts with three 1s, followed by ten 0s, and ends with five 1s.\n- The 1s are shifted three positions to the right, and the 0s are adjusted accordingly.\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3\n- **Output:** 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The input starts with seven 3s, followed by eight 0s, and ends with two 3s.\n- The output starts with four 3s, followed by eight 0s, and ends with five 3s.\n- The 3s are shifted three positions to the right, and the 0s are adjusted accordingly.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- Identify the non-zero segment in the input.\n- Shift this segment to the left or right, depending on the pattern observed in the examples.\n- Adjust the 0s accordingly to maintain the total length of the grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The input has one 2 surrounded by 0s.\n- Based on the examples, the non-zero segment (2) should be shifted to the left by two positions.\n- The output should maintain the same total length as the input.\n\n**Output:**\n- Shift the 2 two positions to the left: 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThus, the final output grid is:\n\n<<<0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
