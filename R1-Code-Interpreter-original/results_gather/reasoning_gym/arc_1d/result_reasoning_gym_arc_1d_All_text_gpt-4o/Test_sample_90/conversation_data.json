    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 5 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 0 0 0\n\n**Observations:**\n1. The first element of the input (5) remains the same in the output.\n2. The second element of the input (5) changes to 0 in the output.\n3. The third element (5) remains the same.\n4. The fourth element (5) remains the same.\n5. The fifth element (0) remains the same.\n6. The sixth element (5) remains the same.\n7. The seventh element (5) remains the same.\n8. The eighth element (0) changes to 5.\n9. The ninth element (5) remains the same.\n10. The tenth element (5) remains the same.\n11. The eleventh element (5) remains the same.\n12. The twelfth element (0) changes to 5.\n13. The thirteenth element (5) remains the same.\n14. The last three elements (0, 0, 0) remain the same.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 4 4 0 4 0 4 4 4 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 4 0 4 4 0 4 4 4 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0\n\n**Observations:**\n1. The first element (4) remains the same.\n2. The second element (4) changes to 0.\n3. The third element (0) changes to 4.\n4. The fourth element (4) remains the same.\n5. The fifth element (0) remains the same.\n6. The sixth element (4) remains the same.\n7. The seventh element (4) remains the same.\n8. The eighth element (4) remains the same.\n9. The ninth element (0) remains the same.\n10. The tenth element (4) remains the same.\n11. The eleventh element (4) remains the same.\n12. The twelfth element (4) remains the same.\n13. The thirteenth element (4) remains the same.\n14. The last three elements (0, 0, 0) remain the same.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 2 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0\n\n**Observations:**\n1. The first element (2) remains the same.\n2. The second element (2) changes to 0.\n3. The third element (2) remains the same.\n4. The fourth element (2) remains the same.\n5. The fifth element (0) remains the same.\n6. The sixth element (2) remains the same.\n7. The seventh element (0) changes to 2.\n8. The eighth element (2) remains the same.\n9. The ninth element (2) remains the same.\n10. The tenth element (0) changes to 2.\n11. The eleventh element (2) remains the same.\n12. The twelfth element (2) remains the same.\n13. The thirteenth element (2) remains the same.\n14. The last three elements (0, 0, 0) remain the same.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\nFrom the analysis, we can derive the following rule:\n- The second element of the input grid is always changed to 0 in the output grid.\n- Any 0 in the input grid that is not in the second position remains the same, except for the eighth and tenth positions, where it changes to the number that appears in the first position of the input grid.\n- All other elements remain unchanged.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 9 9 9 0 9 0 9 9 0 9 9 9 9 0 0 0\n\n**Applying the Rule:**\n1. The first element (9) remains the same.\n2. The second element (9) changes to 0.\n3. The third element (9) remains the same.\n4. The fourth element (0) changes to 9.\n5. The fifth element (9) remains the same.\n6. The sixth element (0) remains the same.\n7. The seventh element (9) remains the same.\n8. The eighth element (9) remains the same.\n9. The ninth element (0) remains the same.\n10. The tenth element (9) remains the same.\n11. The eleventh element (9) remains the same.\n12. The twelfth element (9) remains the same.\n13. The thirteenth element (9) remains the same.\n14. The last three elements (0, 0, 0) remain the same.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<<<9 0 9 9 0 9 9 9 0 9 9 9 9 0 0 0>>>"
