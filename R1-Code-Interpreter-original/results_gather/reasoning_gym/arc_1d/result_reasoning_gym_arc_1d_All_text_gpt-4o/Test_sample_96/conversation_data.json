    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 2 2 5 9 5 9 6 3 1 8 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 8 2 6 5 1\n- **Output:** 9 5 9 6 3 1 8 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 8 2 6 5 1 2 2 5\n\n**Observation:** \n- The output grid is a rearrangement of the input grid.\n- The first part of the output grid (9 5 9 6 3 1 8 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 8 2 6 5 1) is the input grid starting from the 4th element to the end, followed by the first three elements of the input grid (2 2 5).\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 9 6 8 6 8 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 1 4 5 5 7 6\n- **Output:** 6 8 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 1 4 5 5 7 6 9 6 8\n\n**Observation:**\n- The output grid starts from the 4th element of the input grid (6 8 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 1 4 5 5 7 6) and ends with the first three elements of the input grid (9 6 8).\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 9 8 7 1 8 3 7 1 6 7 6 7 9 8 5 8 2 2 0 0 0 5\n- **Output:** 1 8 3 7 1 6 7 6 7 9 8 5 8 2 2 0 0 0 5 9 8 7\n\n**Observation:**\n- The output grid starts from the 4th element of the input grid (1 8 3 7 1 6 7 6 7 9 8 5 8 2 2 0 0 0 5) and ends with the first three elements of the input grid (9 8 7).\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the rule:\n- The output grid is formed by taking the input grid starting from the 4th element to the end, followed by the first three elements of the input grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 3 7 4 4 7 9 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 2 8 1\n- **Output:** Start from the 4th element (4 7 9 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 2 8 1) and append the first three elements (3 7 4).\n\nThus, the output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<4 7 9 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 2 8 1 3 7 4>>>"
