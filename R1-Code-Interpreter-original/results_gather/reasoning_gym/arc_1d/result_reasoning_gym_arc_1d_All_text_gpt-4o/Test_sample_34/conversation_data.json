    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence of 8s in the input starts at the 5th position and ends at the 18th position.\n- In the output, the sequence of 8s starts at the 3rd position and ends at the 16th position.\n- The sequence of 8s is shifted two positions to the left.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence of 9s in the input starts at the 6th position and ends at the 14th position.\n- In the output, the sequence of 9s starts at the 4th position and ends at the 12th position.\n- The sequence of 9s is shifted two positions to the left.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence of 8s in the input starts at the 5th position and ends at the 8th position.\n- In the output, the sequence of 8s starts at the 3rd position and ends at the 6th position.\n- The sequence of 8s is shifted two positions to the left.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\nFrom the analysis of the examples, the rule can be summarized as:\n- Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n- Shift this sequence two positions to the left in the output grid.\n- Maintain the length of the sequence and fill the rest with zeros.\n\n### Test Input Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Application of the Rule:**\n- The sequence of 9s in the input starts at the 7th position and ends at the 12th position.\n- Shift this sequence two positions to the left.\n- The sequence of 9s in the output will start at the 5th position and end at the 10th position.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe output grid for the test input is:\n<<<0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
