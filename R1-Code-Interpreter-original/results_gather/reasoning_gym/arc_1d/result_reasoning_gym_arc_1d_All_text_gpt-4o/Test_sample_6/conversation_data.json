    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input Grid:** 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output Grid:** 2 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The first row remains unchanged.\n- The second row changes from \"0 0 0 2\" to \"0 2 2 2\".\n- The third row changes from \"0 0 0 0\" to \"0 0 2 2\".\n- The fourth row changes from \"0 0 0 0\" to \"0 0 0 2\".\n- The fifth row remains unchanged.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input Grid:** 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output Grid:** 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The first row remains unchanged.\n- The second row changes from \"0 0 0 0\" to \"0 3 3 3\".\n- The third row changes from \"0 0 0 0\" to \"0 0 3 3\".\n- The fourth row changes from \"0 0 0 0\" to \"0 0 0 3\".\n- The fifth row remains unchanged.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input Grid:** 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output Grid:** 7 7 7 7 7 0 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The first row remains unchanged.\n- The second row changes from \"0 0 0 7\" to \"0 7 7 7\".\n- The third row changes from \"0 0 0 0\" to \"0 0 7 7\".\n- The fourth row changes from \"0 0 0 0\" to \"0 0 0 7\".\n- The fifth row remains unchanged.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- The first row of the output grid is the same as the first row of the input grid.\n- For each subsequent row, the transformation involves shifting the non-zero number to the left by one position, and filling the remaining positions with that number until the end of the row.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input Grid:** 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Transformation:**\n- First row remains unchanged: 1 1 1 1 1\n- Second row changes from \"0 0 0 1\" to \"0 1 1 1\"\n- Third row changes from \"0 0 0 0\" to \"0 0 1 1\"\n- Fourth row changes from \"0 0 0 0\" to \"0 0 0 1\"\n- Fifth row remains unchanged: 0 0 0\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe output grid for the test input is:\n<<<1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
