    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:** \n- The sequence of '3's in the input starts at the 5th position and ends at the 25th position.\n- In the output, the sequence of '3's starts at the 2nd position and ends at the 23rd position.\n- The sequence of '3's is shifted left by 3 positions.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence of '2's in the input starts at the 5th position and ends at the 16th position.\n- In the output, the sequence of '2's starts at the 2nd position and ends at the 13th position.\n- The sequence of '2's is shifted left by 3 positions.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence of '6's in the input starts at the 12th position and ends at the 16th position.\n- In the output, the sequence of '6's starts at the 9th position and ends at the 13th position.\n- The sequence of '6's is shifted left by 3 positions.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\nFrom the analysis of the examples, the rule can be derived as follows:\n- Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n- Shift this sequence 3 positions to the left in the output grid.\n- The rest of the positions in the output grid are filled with zeros.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- The sequence of '6's in the input starts at the 13th position and ends at the 20th position.\n- Shift this sequence 3 positions to the left in the output grid, starting at the 10th position and ending at the 17th position.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe output grid for the test input is:\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
