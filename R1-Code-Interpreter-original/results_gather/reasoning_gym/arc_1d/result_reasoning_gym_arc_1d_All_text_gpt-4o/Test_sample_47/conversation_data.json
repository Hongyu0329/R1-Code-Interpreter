    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3\n- **Output:** 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The input grid has a sequence of 3s followed by 0s and then 3s again.\n- The output grid extends the sequence of 3s from the beginning to the middle, replacing the initial 0s with 3s.\n- The trailing 3s in the input are reduced in the output.\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The input grid has a sequence of 8s in the middle.\n- The output grid shifts the sequence of 8s to the right, replacing the initial 8s with 0s.\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The input grid has a sequence of 6s starting from the third position.\n- The output grid shifts the sequence of 6s to the right, replacing the initial 6s with 0s.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\nFrom the examples, the rule can be deduced as follows:\n- Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n- Shift this sequence to the right by a certain number of positions, replacing the initial positions with 0s.\n- The number of positions to shift seems to be determined by the position of the first non-zero number in the sequence.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- The sequence of non-zero numbers is a single '2' starting at the seventh position.\n- Shift this '2' to the right, replacing the initial position with 0.\n\n**Output:**\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
