    "To determine the rule that maps the input grid to the output grid, let's analyze the given examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence of '7's in the input starts at the 4th position and ends at the 10th position.\n- In the output, the sequence of '7's starts at the 2nd position and ends at the 8th position.\n- The sequence of '7's is shifted two positions to the left.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence of '7's in the input starts at the 5th position and ends at the 9th position.\n- In the output, the sequence of '7's starts at the 3rd position and ends at the 7th position.\n- The sequence of '7's is shifted two positions to the left.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The sequence of '4's in the input starts at the 4th position and ends at the 11th position.\n- In the output, the sequence of '4's starts at the 2nd position and ends at the 9th position.\n- The sequence of '4's is shifted two positions to the left.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\nFrom the analysis of the examples, we can derive the following rule:\n- Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n- Shift this sequence two positions to the left in the output grid.\n- Fill the remaining positions with zeros.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers: '3' at the 3rd position.\n2. Shift this sequence two positions to the left: '3' moves to the 1st position.\n3. Fill the remaining positions with zeros.\n\n**Output:**\n- 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThus, the output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
