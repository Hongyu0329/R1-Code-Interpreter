    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0\n\n   Observations:\n   - The sequence of 6s in the input is shifted two positions to the left in the output.\n   - The number of 6s remains the same, but the zeros at the start and end are adjusted accordingly.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n   Observations:\n   - The sequence of 6s is shifted two positions to the left.\n   - The number of 6s remains the same, and the zeros are adjusted at the end.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n   Observations:\n   - The sequence of 6s is shifted two positions to the left.\n   - The zeros at the start are reduced by two, and zeros are added at the end.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can derive the following rule:\n- Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers (e.g., 6s in the examples).\n- Shift this sequence two positions to the left.\n- Adjust the zeros at the start and end to maintain the total length of the grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSteps:\n1. Identify the sequence of 3s: 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n2. Shift this sequence two positions to the left.\n3. Adjust the zeros accordingly.\n\nLet's implement this in code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero element\n    first_non_zero = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), None)\n    if first_non_zero is None:\n        return input_grid  # No non-zero elements, return as is\n    \n    # Find the last non-zero element\n    last_non_zero = len(input_grid) - next((i for i, x in enumerate(reversed(input_grid)) if x != 0), None) - 1\n    \n    # Extract the non-zero sequence\n    non_zero_sequence = input_grid[first_non_zero:last_non_zero + 1]\n    \n    # Create the new grid with the sequence shifted two positions to the left\n    new_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\n    new_grid[2:2 + len(non_zero_sequence)] = non_zero_sequence\n    \n    return new_grid\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output for the test input.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output for the test input. Based on the derived rule and the code execution, the output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
