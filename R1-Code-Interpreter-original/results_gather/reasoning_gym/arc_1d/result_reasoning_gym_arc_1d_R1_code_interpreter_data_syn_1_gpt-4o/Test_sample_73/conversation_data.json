    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of 9s is shifted left by one position.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of 5s is shifted left by one position.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of 5s is shifted left by one position.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers (e.g., 9s, 5s) in the input grid.\n- Shift this sequence one position to the left in the output grid.\n- The rest of the grid remains unchanged.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0\n\nFollowing the rule:\n- Identify the sequence of 7s.\n- Shift the sequence of 7s one position to the left.\n\nLet's implement this in code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the start and end of the sequence of non-zero numbers\n    start = None\n    end = None\n    for i in range(len(input_grid)):\n        if input_grid[i] != 0:\n            if start is None:\n                start = i\n            end = i\n    \n    # If a sequence is found, shift it one position to the left\n    if start is not None and end is not None:\n        output_grid = input_grid[:]\n        for i in range(start, end):\n            output_grid[i] = input_grid[i + 1]\n        output_grid[end] = 0\n        return output_grid\n    else:\n        return input_grid\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]\noutput = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nThe code will execute and provide the output grid based on the derived rule. Let's see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output grid was generated based on the rule we derived. The sequence of 7s was shifted one position to the left, and the rest of the grid remained unchanged. The final output grid is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0>>>"
