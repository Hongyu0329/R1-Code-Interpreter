    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n**Example 1:**\n- **Input:**  4 4 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 4 4 4 0 4 4 4 0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Example 2:**\n- **Input:**  9 9 9 0 0 9 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 9 9 9 0 9 9 9 0 9 9 9 0 9 9 9 0 0 0 0\n\n**Example 3:**\n- **Input:**  5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 5 5 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations\n1. The input grids seem to be represented in a linear form, but they likely correspond to a 2D grid structure.\n2. The output grid appears to be an expansion or filling of certain rows or columns based on the input grid.\n3. The first row in each example remains unchanged.\n4. The second row in the output grid seems to be filled with the same number as the first row if the first row has non-zero numbers.\n5. The third row in the output grid is filled with the same number as the first row if the first row has non-zero numbers.\n6. The rest of the grid remains unchanged.\n\n### Hypothesis\nThe rule seems to be that if the first row of the input grid contains non-zero numbers, the second and third rows in the output grid are filled with the same numbers as the first row.\n\n### Test Input\n- **Input:** 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n\n### Applying the Rule\n1. The first row is `2 2 2 2 2`.\n2. According to the rule, the second and third rows should be filled with `2 2 2 2 2`.\n3. The rest of the grid remains unchanged.\n\nLet's write a Python script to apply this rule to the test input and generate the output grid.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Assuming the grid is 5x4 based on the input length\n    rows = 5\n    cols = 4\n    output_grid = input_grid[:]\n    \n    # Fill the second and third rows with the first row if the first row has non-zero numbers\n    if any(input_grid[i] != 0 for i in range(cols)):\n        for row in range(1, 3):\n            for col in range(cols):\n                output_grid[row * cols + col] = input_grid[col]\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nThe code will execute and provide the output grid based on the identified rule.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output grid based on the rule we identified. The output grid is:\n\n- **Output:** 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n\nThis output matches the expected transformation based on the rule derived from the examples. The first row remains unchanged, and the second and third rows are filled with the same numbers as the first row, while the rest of the grid remains unchanged.\n\n<<<2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0>>>"
