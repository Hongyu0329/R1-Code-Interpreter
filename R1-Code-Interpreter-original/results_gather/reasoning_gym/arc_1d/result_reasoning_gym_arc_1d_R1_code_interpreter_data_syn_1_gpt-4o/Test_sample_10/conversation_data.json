    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 2 9 2 3 4 4 0\n   - **Output:** 2 9 2 3 4 4 0 0 0 0\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 4 4 2 1 1 0\n   - **Output:** 0 4 4 2 1 1 0 0 0 0\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 7 9 4 9 1 0 0\n   - **Output:** 7 9 4 9 1 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations\n\n- In each example, the non-zero elements from the input are shifted to the left in the output.\n- The number of zeros at the end of the output matches the number of zeros at the beginning of the input.\n- The order of non-zero elements is preserved.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nThe rule can be described as follows:\n1. Identify all non-zero elements in the input grid.\n2. Shift these non-zero elements to the left in the output grid.\n3. Fill the remaining positions in the output grid with zeros.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nGiven the test input:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 1 5 0 0 0\n\nFollowing the rule:\n1. Extract non-zero elements: [1, 5]\n2. Shift them to the left: [1, 5]\n3. Fill the rest with zeros: [1, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Extract non-zero elements\n    non_zero_elements = [x for x in input_grid if x != 0]\n    # Calculate the number of zeros to append\n    num_zeros = len(input_grid) - len(non_zero_elements)\n    # Create the output grid\n    output_grid = non_zero_elements + [0] * num_zeros\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n# Transform the grid\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will obtain the output grid for the test input. Let's see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output grid for the test input is `[1, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. This matches our expectations based on the derived rule.\n\nTherefore, the predicted output grid for the given test input is:\n\n<<<1 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
