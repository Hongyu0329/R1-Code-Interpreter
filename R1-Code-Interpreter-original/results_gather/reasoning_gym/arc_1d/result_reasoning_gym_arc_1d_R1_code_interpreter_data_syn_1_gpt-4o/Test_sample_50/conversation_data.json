    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples one by one:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n- **Output:** 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5\n- **Output:** 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\n- **Output:** 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations:\n1. The input and output grids are both 5x5 matrices, represented as a single list of 25 elements.\n2. The transformation seems to involve shifting or rearranging the elements in a specific pattern.\n3. The first row of the output grid seems to be a rearrangement of the first few elements of the input grid.\n4. The last element of the input grid often appears in the output grid, but its position varies.\n5. The transformation might involve shifting elements to the left or right, or rotating them.\n\n### Hypothesis:\n- The transformation involves shifting the non-zero elements in the input grid to the left in the output grid, while maintaining the zeros in their relative positions.\n- The last element of the input grid might be moved to a specific position in the output grid.\n\n### Testing the Hypothesis:\nLet's apply this hypothesis to the test input grid:\n\n- **Test Input:** 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nTo verify the hypothesis, let's write a Python script to apply the transformation rule to the test input grid.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Initialize the output grid with zeros\n    output_grid = [0] * 25\n    \n    # Extract the non-zero elements from the input grid\n    non_zero_elements = [x for x in input_grid if x != 0]\n    \n    # Place the non-zero elements at the start of the output grid\n    for i in range(len(non_zero_elements)):\n        output_grid[i] = non_zero_elements[i]\n    \n    # Return the transformed output grid\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input grid\ntest_input = [2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\n\n# Apply the transformation\ntest_output = transform_grid(test_input)\n\n# Print the output grid\nprint(test_output)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and produced an output grid. Let's analyze the result:\n\n- **Output Grid:** [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThis output grid is consistent with the transformation rule we hypothesized: shifting the non-zero elements to the left while maintaining the zeros in their relative positions.\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer for the test input grid.\n\n<<<2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
