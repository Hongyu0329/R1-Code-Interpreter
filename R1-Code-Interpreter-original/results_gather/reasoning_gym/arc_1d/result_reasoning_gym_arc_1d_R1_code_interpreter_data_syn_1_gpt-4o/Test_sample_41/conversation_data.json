    "To solve this problem, we need to identify a pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:**  0 0 2 9 0 1 1 9 9 0 1 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 2 9 0 1 1 9 9 0 1 0 0 0\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:**  2 6 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 2 6 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:**  2 0 4 3 8 0 0 5 7 7 1 0 0\n- **Output:** 2 4 3 8 0 0 5 7 7 1 0 0 0\n\n### Observations:\n1. In each example, the output grid is derived by removing the first zero from the input grid and appending a zero at the end.\n2. The rest of the elements remain in the same order.\n\n### Rule:\n- Identify the first zero in the input grid.\n- Remove this zero and shift all subsequent elements to the left.\n- Append a zero at the end of the grid.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n### Test Input:\n- **Input:** 3 8 4 0 0 0 7 7 1 0 5 0 0\n\n### Applying the Rule:\n1. Identify the first zero, which is at index 3.\n2. Remove this zero and shift the elements to the left.\n3. Append a zero at the end.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the output grid for the test input.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first zero\n    first_zero_index = input_grid.index(0)\n    # Remove the first zero and shift elements\n    output_grid = input_grid[:first_zero_index] + input_grid[first_zero_index+1:]\n    # Append a zero at the end\n    output_grid.append(0)\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [3, 8, 4, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 1, 0, 5, 0, 0]\n# Get the output\ntest_output = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(test_output)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will get the output grid for the test input. Let's see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output grid for the test input. Based on the rule we derived, the first zero in the input grid was removed, and a zero was appended at the end. The rest of the elements remained in the same order.\n\nTherefore, the output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<3 8 4 0 0 7 7 1 0 5 0 0 0>>>"
