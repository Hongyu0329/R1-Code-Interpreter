    "To solve this problem, we need to identify a pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze each example to find a common transformation rule.\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of 1s is shifted to the right by 5 positions.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of 5s is shifted to the right by 4 positions.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of 9s is shifted to the right by 5 positions.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, it seems that the non-zero sequence in the input grid is shifted to the right by a certain number of positions. The number of positions seems to be determined by the length of the sequence of non-zero numbers. Specifically, the sequence is shifted to the right by a number of positions equal to the length of the sequence minus 1.\n\n### Applying the Rule\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Non-zero Sequence:** 8 8 8 8\n- **Length of Sequence:** 4\n- **Shift Positions:** 4 - 1 = 3\n\nWe will shift the sequence of 8s to the right by 3 positions.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the start and end of the non-zero sequence\n    start = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), None)\n    end = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid[::-1]) if x != 0), None)\n    end = len(input_grid) - end - 1 if end is not None else None\n    \n    if start is None or end is None:\n        return input_grid  # No non-zero sequence found\n    \n    # Length of the non-zero sequence\n    length = end - start + 1\n    \n    # Shift positions\n    shift_positions = length - 1\n    \n    # Create the output grid\n    output_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\n    \n    # Place the non-zero sequence in the new position\n    for i in range(length):\n        output_grid[start + shift_positions + i] = input_grid[start + i]\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the output grid.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output grid. Based on the rule derived from the examples, the sequence of 8s in the test input grid was shifted to the right by 3 positions. The final output grid is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
