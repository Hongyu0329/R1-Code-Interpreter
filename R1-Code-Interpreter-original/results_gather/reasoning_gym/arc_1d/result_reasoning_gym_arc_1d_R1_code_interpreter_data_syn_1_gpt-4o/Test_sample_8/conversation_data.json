    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze each example to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence \"5 5\" is moved from the 7th and 8th positions to the 25th and 26th positions.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence \"8 8 8 8 8\" is moved from the 16th to 20th positions to the 1st to 5th positions.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence \"6 6 6 6\" is moved from the 23rd to 26th positions to the 3rd to 6th positions.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- Identify the non-zero sequence in the input grid.\n- Move this sequence to the leftmost available position in the output grid, maintaining the order of other elements.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0\n- **Non-zero sequence:** \"3 3 3 3 3 3 3\" (from the 19th to 25th positions)\n- **Move to the leftmost position:** Place \"3 3 3 3 3 3 3\" starting from the 1st position.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the non-zero sequence\n    non_zero_sequence = [x for x in input_grid if x != 0]\n    \n    # Create the output grid with the non-zero sequence at the start\n    output_grid = non_zero_sequence + [0] * (len(input_grid) - len(non_zero_sequence))\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\n# Transform the grid\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\n\n# Print the output grid\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the transformed output grid.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output grid based on the derived rule. The non-zero sequence \"3 3 3 3 3 3 3\" was moved to the leftmost position, and the sequence \"2\" was also included at the start of the output grid, as it was the first non-zero element in the input grid.\n\nThe final output grid is:\n\n<<<2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
