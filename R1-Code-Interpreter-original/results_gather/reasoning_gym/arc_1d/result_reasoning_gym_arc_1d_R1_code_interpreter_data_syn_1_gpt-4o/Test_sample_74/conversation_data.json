    "To solve this problem, we need to identify a pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples to find the common rule.\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 5 0 8 8 0 4 0 8\n   - **Output:** 0 0 5 0 5 5 0 5 0 5\n\n   Observations:\n   - The number 5 in the input remains unchanged in the output.\n   - The number 8 in the input is transformed to 5 in the output.\n   - The number 4 in the input is transformed to 5 in the output.\n   - The number 0 remains unchanged.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 6 2 6 0 7 2 0 3 0\n   - **Output:** 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 0\n\n   Observations:\n   - The number 6 in the input is transformed to 5 in the output.\n   - The number 2 in the input is transformed to 5 in the output.\n   - The number 7 in the input is transformed to 5 in the output.\n   - The number 3 in the input is transformed to 5 in the output.\n   - The number 0 remains unchanged.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 9 5 7 3 3 6 0 0 0 3\n   - **Output:** 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 5\n\n   Observations:\n   - The number 9 in the input is transformed to 5 in the output.\n   - The number 5 in the input remains unchanged.\n   - The number 7 in the input is transformed to 5 in the output.\n   - The number 3 in the input is transformed to 5 in the output.\n   - The number 6 in the input is transformed to 5 in the output.\n   - The number 0 remains unchanged.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the observations, we can derive the following rule:\n- Any non-zero number in the input grid is transformed to 5 in the output grid.\n- The number 0 remains unchanged.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 8 0 7 9 7 0\n\nUsing the derived rule:\n- Transform any non-zero number to 5.\n- Keep 0 unchanged.\n\nLet's write a Python script to apply this rule to the test input grid.\n\n```python\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 7, 9, 7, 0]\n\n# Apply the rule: transform non-zero numbers to 5, keep 0 unchanged\noutput_grid = [5 if x != 0 else 0 for x in input_grid]\n\n# Print the output grid\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the output grid for the test input.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output grid for the test input. Based on the rule we derived, the output grid is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 5 0 5 5 5 0>>>"
