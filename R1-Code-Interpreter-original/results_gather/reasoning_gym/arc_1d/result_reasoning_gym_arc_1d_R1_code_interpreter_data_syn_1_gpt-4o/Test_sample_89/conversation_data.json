    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0\n   - **Output:** 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0\n\n   Observations:\n   - The sequence of `3`s in the input starts at index 5 and ends at index 13.\n   - In the output, the sequence of `3`s starts at index 1 and ends at index 10.\n   - The sequence of `3`s is shifted left by 4 positions.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0\n   - **Output:** 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n   Observations:\n   - The sequence of `3`s in the input starts at index 4 and ends at index 13.\n   - In the output, the sequence of `3`s starts at index 0 and ends at index 9.\n   - The sequence of `3`s is shifted left by 4 positions.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n   Observations:\n   - The sequence of `3`s in the input starts at index 8 and ends at index 13.\n   - In the output, the sequence of `3`s starts at index 4 and ends at index 9.\n   - The sequence of `3`s is shifted left by 4 positions.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n- Shift this sequence left by 4 positions in the output grid.\n- Fill the remaining positions with zeros.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\n\nSteps:\n1. Identify the sequence of `1`s in the input, which starts at index 4 and ends at index 14.\n2. Shift this sequence left by 4 positions, so it starts at index 0 and ends at index 10 in the output.\n3. Fill the remaining positions with zeros.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to generate the output grid.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the start and end of the non-zero sequence\n    start = next(i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0)\n    end = len(input_grid) - next(i for i, x in enumerate(reversed(input_grid)) if x != 0)\n    \n    # Create the output grid\n    output_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\n    \n    # Shift the sequence left by 4 positions\n    for i in range(start, end):\n        output_grid[i - 4] = input_grid[i]\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the output grid for the test input.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output grid for the test input. Based on the rule we derived and the code execution, the output grid is:\n\n<<<1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
