    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 6 6 6 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence \"6 6 6\" is moved from the end of the input to the beginning of the output, starting from the 6th position. The \"2\" remains in the same position.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence \"4 4\" is moved to the position after \"2\" in the output. The \"2\" is moved to the 8th position.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 9\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The \"9\" is moved to the 4th position in the output. The \"2\" remains in the same position.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rules:\n- Identify the non-zero sequence at the end of the input grid.\n- Move this sequence to the beginning of the output grid, starting from the 6th position.\n- The \"2\" in the input grid is moved to the 8th position in the output grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 2 0 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n1. Identify the non-zero sequence at the end: \"7 7 7\".\n2. Move \"7 7 7\" to the beginning of the output grid, starting from the 6th position.\n3. Move \"2\" to the 8th position in the output grid.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the output grid.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the position of the first non-zero element from the end\n    non_zero_sequence = []\n    for i in range(len(input_grid) - 1, -1, -1):\n        if input_grid[i] != 0:\n            non_zero_sequence.insert(0, input_grid[i])\n        else:\n            break\n    \n    # Create the output grid\n    output_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\n    \n    # Place the non-zero sequence starting from the 6th position\n    for i in range(len(non_zero_sequence)):\n        output_grid[5 + i] = non_zero_sequence[i]\n    \n    # Find the position of '2' in the input grid and place it in the 8th position\n    if 2 in input_grid:\n        output_grid[7] = 2\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the output grid based on the derived rule. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "It seems there was an error in the logic of the code. Let's revisit the rule and correct the implementation:\n\n1. We need to identify the sequence of non-zero numbers at the end of the input grid.\n2. Move this sequence to the beginning of the output grid, starting from the 6th position.\n3. Ensure that the \"2\" is placed in the 8th position in the output grid.\n\nLet's correct the code to reflect this logic:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the position of the first non-zero element from the end\n    non_zero_sequence = []\n    for i in range(len(input_grid) - 1, -1, -1):\n        if input_grid[i] != 0:\n            non_zero_sequence.insert(0, input_grid[i])\n        else:\n            break\n    \n    # Create the output grid\n    output_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\n    \n    # Place the non-zero sequence starting from the 6th position\n    for i in range(len(non_zero_sequence)):\n        output_grid[5 + i] = non_zero_sequence[i]\n    \n    # Find the position of '2' in the input grid and place it in the 8th position\n    if 2 in input_grid:\n        output_grid[8] = 2\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nThis revised code should correctly apply the transformation rule. Let's execute it to verify the output.",
    "It seems there was a misunderstanding in the placement of the \"2\" and the non-zero sequence. Let's carefully re-evaluate the rule and correct the code:\n\n1.

    "I apologize for the oversight. Let's carefully analyze the examples again and correct the logic:\n\n1. **Example 1:** The sequence \"6 6 6\" is moved to the 6th position, and \"2\" remains in the 10th position.\n2. **Example 2:** The sequence \"4 4\" is moved to the 9th position, and \"2\" is moved to the 8th position.\n3. **Example 3:** The \"9\" is moved to the 4th position, and \"2\" remains in the 10th position.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems the non-zero sequence is moved to a specific position, and \"2\" is placed in a specific position based on the input.\n\nLet's correct the code to reflect this logic:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Create the output grid\n    output_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\n    \n    # Find the position of '2' in the input grid\n    two_position = input_grid.index(2)\n    \n    # Place '2' in the 9th position of the output grid\n    output_grid[8] = 2\n    \n    # Find the non-zero sequence after '2'\n    non_zero_sequence = []\n    for i in range(two_position + 1, len(input_grid)):\n        if input_grid[i] != 0:\n            non_zero_sequence.append(input_grid[i])\n    \n    # Place the non-zero sequence starting from the 6th position\n    for i in range(len(non_zero_sequence)):\n        output_grid[5 + i] = non_zero_sequence[i]\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nLet's execute this corrected code to verify the output.",
    "The output `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` matches the expected transformation based on the rule derived from the examples. The sequence \"7 7 7\" is moved to start from the 6th position, and \"2\" is placed in the 9th position.\n\nTherefore, the final output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
