    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Observations:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input:  0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 8 8 2 2 0 0 8 8 2 2 0 0 0\n\n   Observing the transformation, the first two '2's in the sequence are transformed into '8's, while the rest remain unchanged.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input:  0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 8 2 0 0 0 0 8 8 2 2 2 0 0\n\n   Here, the first '2' in each contiguous block of '2's is transformed into '8', except when a block of '2's is at the end of the sequence.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input:  2 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 8 8 2 2 2 0 8 8 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n\n   The first two '2's in each contiguous block of '2's are transformed into '8's.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n\nFrom the examples, it seems the rule is:\n- For each contiguous block of '2's, transform the first two '2's into '8's. If there is only one '2' in a block, transform it into '8'. If there are more than two '2's, only the first two are transformed.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- **Input:** 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 2 2 2\n\nWe will write a Python script to apply this rule to the test input grid.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    output_grid = input_grid[:]\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(input_grid):\n        if input_grid[i] == 2:\n            # Count the length of the contiguous block of '2's\n            start = i\n            while i < len(input_grid) and input_grid[i] == 2:\n                i += 1\n            end = i\n            # Transform the first two '2's in the block to '8's\n            for j in range(start, min(start + 2, end)):\n                output_grid[j] = 8\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nThe code will be executed to determine the output grid for the test input.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output grid for the test input. Based on the rule we derived and applied, the transformation of the test input grid results in the following output grid:\n\n<<<0 0 8 8 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 8 8 2>>>"
