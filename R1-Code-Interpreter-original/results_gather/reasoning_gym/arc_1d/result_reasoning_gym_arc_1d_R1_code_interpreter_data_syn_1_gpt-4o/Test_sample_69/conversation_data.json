    "To solve this problem, we need to identify a pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples one by one:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n- **Output:** 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5\n\n### Observations:\n1. The output grid seems to be a rearrangement of the input grid.\n2. The sequence of numbers in the output grid is similar to the input grid but with some elements shifted or replaced.\n3. The first part of the output grid seems to retain the non-zero elements from the input grid, but the zeros are shifted towards the end.\n4. The last element of the output grid in Example 3 is the first non-zero element from the input grid.\n\n### Hypothesis:\n- The rule seems to involve shifting the zeros towards the end of the grid while maintaining the order of non-zero elements.\n- The last element of the output grid is the first non-zero element from the input grid.\n\n### Test Input:\n- **Input:** 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n\n### Applying the Rule:\n1. Identify the non-zero elements: 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n2. Shift the zeros towards the end.\n3. Place the first non-zero element at the end of the output grid.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to generate the output grid for the test input.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Extract non-zero elements\n    non_zero_elements = [x for x in input_grid if x != 0]\n    # Count zeros\n    zero_count = len(input_grid) - len(non_zero_elements)\n    # Construct the output grid\n    output_grid = non_zero_elements[:-1] + [0] * zero_count + [non_zero_elements[0]]\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output grid for the test input.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output grid for the test input. Based on the rule we derived, the output grid is constructed by shifting the zeros towards the end and placing the first non-zero element at the end of the grid.\n\nThe final output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4>>>"
