    "To solve this problem, we need to identify a pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 2 1 0 0 9 4 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 2 1 0 0 9 4 0 0 3 0 0 0 0\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 7 7 3 0 0 1 4 0 6 9 0 3\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 7 7 3 0 0 1 4 0 6 9 3\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 5 7 6 0 1 0 6 6 0 0 0 5 2 0\n- **Output:** 0 5 7 6 0 1 0 6 6 0 0 0 5 2\n\n### Observations:\n1. In each example, the output grid is a shifted version of the input grid.\n2. The shift involves moving the first non-zero element to the start of the output grid, and the rest of the elements are shifted to the right.\n3. The zeros at the beginning of the input grid are moved to the end of the output grid.\n\n### Rule:\n- Identify the first non-zero element in the input grid.\n- Move this element to the start of the output grid.\n- Shift all other elements to the right, maintaining their order.\n- Move any leading zeros to the end of the grid.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n### Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 3 0 0 4 6\n\n### Applying the Rule:\n1. The first non-zero element is `8`.\n2. Move `8` to the start of the output grid.\n3. Shift the remaining elements to the right.\n4. Move the leading zeros to the end.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the output grid.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero element\n    first_non_zero_index = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), None)\n    \n    if first_non_zero_index is not None:\n        # Create the output grid by shifting elements\n        output_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\n        output_grid[0] = input_grid[first_non_zero_index]\n        output_grid[1:] = input_grid[:first_non_zero_index] + input_grid[first_non_zero_index+1:]\n    else:\n        # If no non-zero element is found, return the input grid as is\n        output_grid = input_grid\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 3, 0, 0, 4, 6]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nThe code will execute and provide the output grid based on the identified rule.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output grid `[8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 3, 0, 0, 4, 6]`. This output is consistent with the rule we derived from the examples. The first non-zero element `8` was moved to the start of the grid, and the rest of the elements were shifted accordingly.\n\nTherefore, the predicted output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 3 0 0 4 6>>>"
