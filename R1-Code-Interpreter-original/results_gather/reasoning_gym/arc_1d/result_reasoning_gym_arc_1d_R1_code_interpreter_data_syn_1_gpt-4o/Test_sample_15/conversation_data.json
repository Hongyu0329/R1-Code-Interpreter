    "To solve this problem, we need to identify a pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 2 0 7 7 7 7 7 7\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 2 7 7 7 7 7 7 0\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 2 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n- **Output:** 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 8 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 8 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations:\n1. In Example 1, the first non-zero number after the initial zeros (2) is followed by a sequence of another number (7). In the output, the sequence of 7s is shifted left, replacing the zero after 2, and the last 7 is replaced by 0.\n2. In Example 2, the first non-zero number (2) is followed by a sequence of 6s. In the output, the sequence of 6s is shifted left, replacing the zero after 2, and the last 6 is replaced by 0.\n3. In Example 3, there is no sequence of numbers after the initial non-zero numbers, so the output remains the same.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n- Identify the first non-zero number in the input.\n- If there is a sequence of another number following the first non-zero number, shift this sequence left by one position, replacing the zero after the first non-zero number.\n- Replace the last number in the sequence with 0.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 2\n- The first non-zero number is 9, followed by a sequence of 9s.\n- Shift the sequence of 9s left by one position, replacing the zero after the first 9.\n- Replace the last 9 with 0.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to predict the output for the test input.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero number\n    first_non_zero_index = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), None)\n    \n    if first_non_zero_index is None:\n        return input_grid  # No non-zero numbers, return as is\n    \n    # Find the sequence of numbers after the first non-zero number\n    sequence_start = first_non_zero_index + 1\n    sequence_number = input_grid[sequence_start]\n    \n    # Find the end of the sequence\n    sequence_end = sequence_start\n    while sequence_end < len(input_grid) and input_grid[sequence_end] == sequence_number:\n        sequence_end += 1\n    \n    # Create the output grid\n    output_grid = input_grid[:]\n    \n    # Shift the sequence left by one position\n    if sequence_end > sequence_start:\n        output_grid[sequence_start:sequence_end-1] = input_grid[sequence_start+1:sequence_end]\n        output_grid[sequence_end-1] = 0\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 2]\noutput = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output for the test input.",
    "The code executed without errors, and the output is `[9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]`. This output matches the expected transformation based on the rule we derived from the examples.\n\n### Explanation:\n- The first non-zero number is 9, and it is followed by a sequence of 9s.\n- The sequence of 9s is shifted left by one position, replacing the zero after the first 9.\n- The last 9 in the sequence is replaced by 0.\n\nTherefore, the predicted output for the test input is:\n\n<<<9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 2>>>"
