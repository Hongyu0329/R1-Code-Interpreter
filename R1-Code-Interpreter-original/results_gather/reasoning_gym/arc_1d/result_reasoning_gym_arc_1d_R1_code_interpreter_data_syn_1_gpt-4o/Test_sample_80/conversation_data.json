    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Observations:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 4 0 4 0 6 3 0 0 7 2 4 2 0 0 0 4 9 1 0 7 0 0 7 2\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 5 0 5 0 5 5 0 0 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 5 5\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: 5 3 4 0 2 2 0 0 8 9 0 1 0 0 0 0 7 9 5 0 3 0 0 2 7 0 0 6\n   - Output: 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 0 5 5 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 5 5 0 0 5\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: 3 9 8 9 0 1 0 5 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 3 4 0 9 5 0 3 6 8 5 0\n   - Output: 5 5 5 5 0 5 0 5 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 0\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- The output grid seems to replace certain numbers with 5.\n- The number 5 appears frequently in the output, suggesting a rule that involves replacing numbers with 5.\n- In each example, numbers greater than 0 in the input are replaced with 5 in the output, except for 0, which remains 0.\n\n### Hypothesis:\n\nThe rule appears to be:\n- Replace any non-zero number in the input grid with 5.\n- Keep zeros as zeros.\n\n### Verification:\n\nLet's verify this hypothesis with the given examples:\n\n- **Example 1:**\n  - Input: 0 0 0 0 4 0 4 0 6 3 0 0 7 2 4 2 0 0 0 4 9 1 0 7 0 0 7 2\n  - Applying the rule: 0 0 0 0 5 0 5 0 5 5 0 0 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 5 5\n  - Matches the output.\n\n- **Example 2:**\n  - Input: 5 3 4 0 2 2 0 0 8 9 0 1 0 0 0 0 7 9 5 0 3 0 0 2 7 0 0 6\n  - Applying the rule: 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 0 5 5 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 5 5 0 0 5\n  - Matches the output.\n\n- **Example 3:**\n  - Input: 3 9 8 9 0 1 0 5 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 3 4 0 9 5 0 3 6 8 5 0\n  - Applying the rule: 5 5 5 5 0 5 0 5 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 0\n  - Matches the output.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe rule is consistent across all examples. Now, let's apply this rule to the test input grid.\n\n### Test Input:\n- Input: 0 2 9 6 0 4 7 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 4 2 0 2 0 7 9 0 6 6 4 0 9 0\n\n### Applying the Rule:\n\nWe will write a Python script to apply the rule to the test input grid.\n\n```python\ninput_grid = [0, 2, 9, 6, 0, 4, 7, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 0, 2, 0, 7, 9, 0, 6, 6, 4, 0, 9, 0]\noutput_grid = [5 if x != 0 else 0 for x in input_grid]\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the output grid.",
    "The code executed successfully and produced the output grid based on the rule we identified. The rule is to replace any non-zero number in the input grid with 5, while keeping zeros as zeros.\n\nThe output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<0 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 5 5 0 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 5 0 5 0>>>"
