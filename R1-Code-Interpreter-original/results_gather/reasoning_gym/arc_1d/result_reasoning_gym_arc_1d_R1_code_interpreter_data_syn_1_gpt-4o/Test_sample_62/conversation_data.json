    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Observations from Examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input:  8 8 0 0 1 1 0 0 8 8 0 0 7 0 0\n   - Output: 8 8 3 3 1 1 3 3 8 8 3 0 7 0 0\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input:  1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 6 6 0 0\n   - Output: 1 0 0 0 0 3 1 1 3 0 3 6 6 3 0\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input:  5 5 0 0 2 2 0 0 6 0 0 0 1 1 0\n   - Output: 5 5 3 3 2 2 3 0 6 0 0 3 1 1 3\n\n### Pattern Analysis:\n\n- The number `3` is inserted in the output grid at specific positions.\n- The `3` appears to be inserted after every sequence of non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n- The `3` is not inserted if the sequence is followed by another non-zero number or if it is at the end of the grid.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n\n1. Traverse the input grid.\n2. Whenever a sequence of non-zero numbers ends, insert a `3` unless:\n   - The sequence is followed by another non-zero number.\n   - The sequence is at the end of the grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- **Input:** 4 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 9 9 9 0 0 0 0\n\nWe'll write a Python script to automate this process and generate the output grid.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    output_grid = []\n    n = len(input_grid)\n    for i in range(n):\n        output_grid.append(input_grid[i])\n        # Check if the current number is the end of a sequence of non-zero numbers\n        if input_grid[i] != 0:\n            # Check if the next number is zero or if we are at the end of the grid\n            if i + 1 < n and input_grid[i + 1] == 0:\n                output_grid.append(3)\n            elif i + 1 == n:\n                output_grid.append(3)\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [4, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the output for the test input.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output for the test input. Let's analyze the output to ensure it aligns with the derived rule:\n\n- **Input:** 4 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 9 9 9 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 4 3 0 0 5 5 3 0 0 0 9 9 9 3 0 0 0 0\n\n### Verification:\n\n1. After the first non-zero number `4`, a `3` is inserted because it is followed by a zero.\n2. After the sequence `5 5`, a `3` is inserted because it is followed by a zero.\n3. After the sequence `9 9 9`, a `3` is inserted because it is followed by a zero.\n\nThe output grid correctly follows the rule derived from the examples. Therefore, the transformation rule has been applied correctly.\n\n<<<4 3 0 0 5 5 3 0 0 0 9 9 9 3 0 0 0 0>>>"
