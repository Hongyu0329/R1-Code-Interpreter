    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0\n\n   Observations:\n   - The sequence of 7s is shifted to the right by 3 positions.\n   - The trailing zeros are adjusted to accommodate the shift.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n   Observations:\n   - The sequence of 3s is shifted to the right by 3 positions.\n   - The trailing zeros are adjusted to accommodate the shift.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n   Observations:\n   - The single 2 is shifted to the right by 3 positions.\n   - The zeros are adjusted accordingly.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- Identify the non-zero sequence in the input grid.\n- Shift this sequence to the right by 3 positions.\n- Fill the remaining positions with zeros.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n- **Test Input:** 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSteps:\n1. Identify the non-zero sequence: 2 2 2\n2. Shift this sequence to the right by 3 positions.\n3. Fill the remaining positions with zeros.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the output grid.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero element\n    start_index = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), None)\n    if start_index is None:\n        return input_grid  # If all zeros, return as is\n\n    # Find the end of the non-zero sequence\n    end_index = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid[start_index:], start=start_index) if x == 0), len(input_grid))\n\n    # Extract the non-zero sequence\n    non_zero_sequence = input_grid[start_index:end_index]\n\n    # Create the output grid with zeros\n    output_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\n\n    # Place the non-zero sequence shifted by 3 positions\n    output_start_index = start_index + 3\n    output_grid[output_start_index:output_start_index + len(non_zero_sequence)] = non_zero_sequence\n\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the output grid based on the derived rule. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and produced the output grid based on the derived transformation rule. The non-zero sequence from the input grid was shifted to the right by 3 positions, and the remaining positions were filled with zeros.\n\nThe final output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
