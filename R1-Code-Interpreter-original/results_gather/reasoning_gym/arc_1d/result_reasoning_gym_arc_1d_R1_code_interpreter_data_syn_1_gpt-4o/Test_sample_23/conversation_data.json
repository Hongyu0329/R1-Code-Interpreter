    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of 2s is shifted left by 4 positions.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The same transformation as Example 1.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of 8s is shifted left by 5 positions.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n- Shift this sequence to the left by a certain number of positions, which seems to be determined by the position of the first non-zero number in the input grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0\n- The sequence of 7s starts at position 4.\n- Shift this sequence to the left by 4 positions.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the output grid.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero element\n    first_non_zero_index = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), None)\n    \n    # If no non-zero element is found, return the input as is\n    if first_non_zero_index is None:\n        return input_grid\n    \n    # Determine the length of the non-zero sequence\n    non_zero_sequence = [x for x in input_grid if x != 0]\n    sequence_length = len(non_zero_sequence)\n    \n    # Create the output grid\n    output_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\n    \n    # Place the non-zero sequence shifted to the left\n    output_grid[first_non_zero_index - sequence_length:first_non_zero_index] = non_zero_sequence\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]\noutput = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nThe code will execute and provide the output grid based on the derived rule.",
    "It seems there was an error in the code logic. Let's revisit the rule and correct the implementation.\n\n### Corrected Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, the rule is:\n- Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n- Shift this sequence to the left by the number of leading zeros before the sequence starts.\n\n### Correcting the Code\n\nLet's correct the code to implement this rule properly.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero element\n    first_non_zero_index = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), None)\n    \n    # If no non-zero element is found, return the input as is\n    if first_non_zero_index is None:\n        return input_grid\n    \n    # Determine the length of the non-zero sequence\n    non_zero_sequence = [x for x in input_grid if x != 0]\n    sequence_length = len(non_zero_sequence)\n    \n    # Create the output grid\n    output_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\n    \n    # Place the non-zero sequence shifted to the left\n    output_grid[:sequence_length] = non_zero_sequence\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]\noutput = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nThis code should correctly apply the transformation rule to the test input. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The output is now correct based on the rule derived from the examples. The sequence of 7s has been shifted to the leftmost position, which matches the pattern observed in the examples.\n\nTherefore, the final output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
