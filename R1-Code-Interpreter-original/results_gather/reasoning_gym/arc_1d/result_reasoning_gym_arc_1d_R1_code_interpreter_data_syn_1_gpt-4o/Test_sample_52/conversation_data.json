    "To solve this problem, we need to identify a pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples to find a consistent transformation rule.\n\n### Analysis of Examples\n\n**Example 1:**\n- Input: 2 0 2 0 0 0 2 2 0 2 1\n- Output: 2 2 2 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Example 2:**\n- Input: 2 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 2 1\n- Output: 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0\n\n**Example 3:**\n- Input: 0 0 0 1 2 0 2 1 0 2 0\n- Output: 2 2 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations\n1. The output grid always starts with a sequence of '2's followed by '1's and then '0's.\n2. The number of '2's in the output seems to be the count of '2's in the input.\n3. The number of '1's in the output seems to be the count of '1's in the input.\n4. The remaining positions are filled with '0's.\n\n### Rule Derivation\nFrom the observations, we can derive the following rule:\n- Count the number of '2's in the input grid.\n- Count the number of '1's in the input grid.\n- Construct the output grid by placing the counted number of '2's first, followed by the counted number of '1's, and fill the rest with '0's.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\nLet's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n**Test Input:**\n- Input: 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 0 0\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Count the number of '2's: 4\n2. Count the number of '1's: 0\n3. Construct the output grid: Start with four '2's, followed by zero '1's, and fill the rest with '0's.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to generate the output grid for the test input.\n\n```python\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\n# Count the number of 2's and 1's\ncount_2 = input_grid.count(2)\ncount_1 = input_grid.count(1)\n\n# Construct the output grid\noutput_grid = [2] * count_2 + [1] * count_1 + [0] * (len(input_grid) - count_2 - count_1)\n\n# Print the output grid\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output grid for the test input.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output grid for the test input is generated based on the derived rule. The output grid is constructed by placing the counted number of '2's first, followed by the counted number of '1's, and filling the rest with '0's.\n\nThe final output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
