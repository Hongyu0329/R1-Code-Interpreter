    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 9 2 7 4 7 7 4 3 2 6 3 8 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 9 2 7 4 7 7 4 3 2 6 3 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 1 2 2 8 7 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 8 1 2 2 8 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 2 8 5 1 3 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 8 2 8 5 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations\n\n- In each example, the output grid is longer than the input grid by one element.\n- The transformation involves shifting the non-zero elements to the left, and the remaining positions are filled with zeros.\n- The number of zeros at the beginning of the input grid is reduced, and the non-zero sequence is shifted to the leftmost position in the output grid.\n- The output grid ends with zeros to maintain the same length as the input grid plus one.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nThe rule can be described as follows:\n1. Identify the first non-zero element in the input grid.\n2. Shift all elements from this position to the end of the grid to the leftmost position in the output grid.\n3. Fill the remaining positions in the output grid with zeros to match the length of the input grid plus one.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 6 3 5 1 7 9 1 2 4 9 6 3 2 0 0\n\nFollowing the rule:\n1. The first non-zero element is 6.\n2. Shift the sequence starting from 6 to the leftmost position.\n3. Fill the remaining positions with zeros.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero element\n    first_non_zero_index = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), len(input_grid))\n    # Create the output grid by shifting elements and adding zeros\n    output_grid = input_grid[first_non_zero_index:] + [0] * (first_non_zero_index + 1)\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 3, 5, 1, 7, 9, 1, 2, 4, 9, 6, 3, 2, 0, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nThis code will generate the output grid based on the derived rule. Let's execute it to get the final answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and produced the output grid based on the rule we derived. The transformation correctly shifts the non-zero elements to the leftmost position and fills the remaining positions with zeros.\n\nThe final output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<6 3 5 1 7 9 1 2 4 9 6 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
