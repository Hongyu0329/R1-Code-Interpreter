    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples to find a pattern.\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n   - **Output:** 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n\n   Observations:\n   - The first three '8's in the input are extended to five '8's in the output.\n   - The sequence of zeros is shifted to the right by two positions.\n   - The rest of the sequence remains unchanged.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n   - **Output:** 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n\n   Observations:\n   - The first four '4's in the input are extended to six '4's in the output.\n   - The sequence of zeros is shifted to the right by two positions.\n   - The rest of the sequence remains unchanged.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n   - **Output:** 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n\n   Observations:\n   - The single '7' at the start is extended to two '7's in the output.\n   - The sequence of zeros is shifted to the right by two positions.\n   - The rest of the sequence remains unchanged.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can derive the following rule:\n- Identify the initial sequence of non-zero numbers at the start of the input.\n- Extend this sequence by two additional numbers of the same value.\n- Shift the sequence of zeros to the right by two positions.\n- Keep the rest of the sequence unchanged.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n- **Input:** 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4\n\n1. Identify the initial sequence of non-zero numbers: 4 4 4 4 4 4\n2. Extend this sequence by two additional '4's: 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n3. Shift the sequence of zeros to the right by two positions.\n4. The rest of the sequence remains unchanged.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to generate the output grid.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero sequence\n    first_non_zero = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), None)\n    if first_non_zero is None:\n        return input_grid  # No non-zero element found, return as is\n\n    # Find the end of the first non-zero sequence\n    end_non_zero = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid[first_non_zero:], start=first_non_zero) if x == 0), len(input_grid))\n\n    # Extend the non-zero sequence by two\n    non_zero_sequence = input_grid[first_non_zero:end_non_zero]\n    extended_sequence = non_zero_sequence + non_zero_sequence[:2]\n\n    # Shift the zero sequence by two positions\n    zero_sequence = input_grid[end_non_zero:]\n    shifted_zero_sequence = [0, 0] + zero_sequence[:-2]\n\n    # Combine the sequences\n    output_grid = extended_sequence + shifted_zero_sequence\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the output grid for the test input.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output grid. Based on the derived rule and the code execution, the output grid for the given test input is:\n\n<<<4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
