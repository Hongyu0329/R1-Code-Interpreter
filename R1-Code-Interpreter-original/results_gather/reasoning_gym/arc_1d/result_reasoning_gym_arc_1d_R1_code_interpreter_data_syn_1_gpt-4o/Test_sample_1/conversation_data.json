    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 3 9 6 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 8 9 9\n   - **Output:** 9 9 3 9 6 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 8\n   - **Observation:** The first three numbers of the input (3, 9, 6) are rearranged to (9, 9, 3) in the output. The rest of the numbers remain unchanged until the last two numbers (9, 9) are removed.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 2 5 7 5 9 8 1 7 5 6 9 4 2 1 6\n   - **Output:** 1 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 2 5 7 5 9 8 1 7 5 6 9 4 2\n   - **Observation:** The last two numbers of the input (1, 6) are moved to the front of the output. The rest of the numbers are shifted right, and the last two numbers (1, 6) are removed.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 2 2 3 2 2 6 1 1 0 4 2 6 2 6 4 9 5 6 1 6 9 5 9 7 7 3 2 1 6 9\n   - **Output:** 6 9 2 2 3 2 2 6 1 1 0 4 2 6 2 6 4 9 5 6 1 6 9 5 9 7 7 3 2 1\n   - **Observation:** The last two numbers of the input (6, 9) are moved to the front of the output. The rest of the numbers are shifted right, and the last two numbers (6, 9) are removed.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- Take the last two numbers of the input grid and move them to the front of the output grid.\n- Shift the rest of the numbers to the right by two positions.\n- Remove the last two numbers from the input grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 4 4 7 8 8 6 9 8 5 8 2 1 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Last two numbers:** 0, 0\n- **Output:** Move 0, 0 to the front, shift the rest to the right, and remove the last two numbers.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to verify:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Take the last two numbers\n    last_two = input_grid[-2:]\n    # Move them to the front and shift the rest\n    output_grid = last_two + input_grid[:-2]\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 4, 4, 7, 8, 8, 6, 9, 8, 5, 8, 2, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output matches the expected transformation based on the rule derived from the examples. The last two numbers of the input grid were moved to the front, and the rest of the numbers were shifted to the right, with the last two numbers removed.\n\nTherefore, the output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 4 4 7 8 8 6 9 8 5 8 2 1 8 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
