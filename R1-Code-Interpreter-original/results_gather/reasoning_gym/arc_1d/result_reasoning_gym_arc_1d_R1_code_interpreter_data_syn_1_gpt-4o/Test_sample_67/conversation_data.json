    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples to deduce the rule:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The number 4 appears at positions 5 and 19 in the input. In the output, the number 4 is extended from position 5 to position 19.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The number 4 appears at positions 4 and 7 in the input. In the output, the number 4 is extended from position 4 to position 7.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The number 2 appears at positions 8 and 12 in the input. In the output, the number 2 is extended from position 8 to position 12.\n\n### Rule Deduction\n\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- Identify the non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n- For each unique non-zero number, find the first and last occurrence in the input grid.\n- Extend the non-zero number from its first occurrence to its last occurrence in the output grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 9\n\nWe will write a Python script to automate this process:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    output_grid = input_grid.copy()\n    unique_numbers = set(input_grid) - {0}\n    \n    for number in unique_numbers:\n        first_index = input_grid.index(number)\n        last_index = len(input_grid) - 1 - input_grid[::-1].index(number)\n        for i in range(first_index, last_index + 1):\n            output_grid[i] = number\n    \n    return output_grid\n\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 9]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the output grid for the test input.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output grid for the test input. Based on the rule we deduced and the code execution, the output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9>>>"
