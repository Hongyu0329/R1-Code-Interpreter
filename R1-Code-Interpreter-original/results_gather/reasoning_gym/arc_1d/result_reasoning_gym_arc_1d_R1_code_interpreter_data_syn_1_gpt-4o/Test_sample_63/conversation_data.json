    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples to deduce the rule:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 6 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5\n   - **Output:** 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 5\n\n   Observations:\n   - The non-zero numbers in the input are 6, 1, 2, 3, and 5.\n   - In the output, each non-zero number is repeated consecutively, filling the positions of zeros in the input.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 2 0 5\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 2 2 5\n\n   Observations:\n   - The non-zero numbers in the input are 4, 2, and 5.\n   - In the output, each non-zero number is repeated consecutively, filling the positions of zeros in the input.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 5 0 0 0 0 7 3 0 0 0 0 0 8 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 5 7 7 7 7 7 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n   Observations:\n   - The non-zero numbers in the input are 5, 7, 3, and 8.\n   - In the output, each non-zero number is repeated consecutively, filling the positions of zeros in the input.\n\n### Deduced Rule\n\nFrom the examples, the rule can be deduced as follows:\n- Identify the non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n- For each non-zero number, replace the zeros in the input grid with the non-zero number, repeating it consecutively until the next non-zero number is encountered or the grid ends.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 5\n\nWe will write a Python script to automate this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    output_grid = []\n    current_value = 0\n    for value in input_grid:\n        if value != 0:\n            current_value = value\n        output_grid.append(current_value)\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 5]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the output grid.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output grid was generated based on the deduced rule. The transformation rule was applied correctly to the test input grid, resulting in the following output grid:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 7 7 7 7 5>>>"
