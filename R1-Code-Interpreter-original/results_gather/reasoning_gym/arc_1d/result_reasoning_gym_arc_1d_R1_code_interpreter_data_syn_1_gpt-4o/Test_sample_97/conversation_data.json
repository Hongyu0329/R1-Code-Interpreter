    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 1 1 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 1 1 0 0 0\n\n   Observations:\n   - The number `2` in the input is expanded to fill the surrounding zeros in the output.\n   - The `1 1` sequence remains unchanged.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 5 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0\n\n   Observations:\n   - The number `5` in the input is expanded to fill the surrounding zeros in the output.\n   - The `1 1 1 1` sequence remains unchanged.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 8 8 8 8 0 8 8 8\n\n   Observations:\n   - The number `8` in the input is expanded to fill the surrounding zeros in the output.\n   - The `1 1 1 1` sequence remains unchanged.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can derive the following rule:\n- Identify the non-zero number (other than `1`) in the input grid.\n- Expand this number to fill the surrounding zeros in the output grid.\n- Keep the sequence of `1`s unchanged.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n- **Test Input:** 0 2 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nFollowing the rule:\n- The number `2` should be expanded to fill the surrounding zeros.\n- The `1 1` sequence remains unchanged.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to generate the output grid.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    output_grid = input_grid[:]\n    n = len(input_grid)\n    \n    # Find the non-zero number (other than 1) to expand\n    for i in range(n):\n        if input_grid[i] != 0 and input_grid[i] != 1:\n            num_to_expand = input_grid[i]\n            break\n    \n    # Expand the number to fill surrounding zeros\n    for i in range(n):\n        if input_grid[i] == 0:\n            if (i > 0 and input_grid[i-1] == num_to_expand) or (i < n-1 and input_grid[i+1] == num_to_expand):\n                output_grid[i] = num_to_expand\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [0, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\ntest_output = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(test_output)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output for the test input.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output for the test input. Based on the derived rule and the code execution, the output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<2 2 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
