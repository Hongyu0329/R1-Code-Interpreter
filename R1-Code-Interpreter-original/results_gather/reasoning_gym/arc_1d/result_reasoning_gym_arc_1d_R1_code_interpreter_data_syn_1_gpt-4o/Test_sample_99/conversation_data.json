    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 2 8 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 2 2 5 0\n   - **Output:** 0 2 8 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 2 2 5\n\n   Observations:\n   - The first element of the input (2) is moved to the second position in the output.\n   - The rest of the elements are shifted one position to the right.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 3 0 0 0 0 4 2 7 5 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 9 6 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 4 2 7 5 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 9 6 0\n\n   Observations:\n   - The first element of the input (0) is moved to the second position in the output.\n   - The rest of the elements are shifted one position to the right.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 5 0 6 4 1 4 6 1 0 0 3 0 8 2 0 0 2 0 6 8 0\n   - **Output:** 0 5 0 6 4 1 4 6 1 0 0 3 0 8 2 0 0 2 0 6 8\n\n   Observations:\n   - The first element of the input (5) is moved to the second position in the output.\n   - The rest of the elements are shifted one position to the right.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- The first element of the input grid is moved to the second position in the output grid.\n- All other elements are shifted one position to the right.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 4 0 9 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 1 0 6 0 0 0 9 0\n\nAccording to the rule:\n- The first element (0) will be moved to the second position.\n- All other elements will be shifted one position to the right.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the output grid.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Move the first element to the second position and shift others to the right\n    return [0] + input_grid[:-1]\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 9, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 1, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the output grid for the test input.",
    "The code executed correctly and produced the output grid based on the derived rule. The transformation rule was applied to the test input grid, resulting in the following output:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 4 0 9 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 1 0 6 0 0 0 9>>>"
