    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Observations from Examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: 0 6 6 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 6 6 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Observation: The sequence \"6 6 9\" is shifted one position to the right.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 7 8 9 6 9 9 8 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 7 8 9 6 9 9 8 0 0\n   - Observation: The sequence \"7 8 9 6 9 9 8\" is shifted one position to the right.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 2 7 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 2 7 0 0 0\n   - Observation: The sequence \"7 2 7\" is shifted one position to the right.\n\n### Common Rule:\nFrom the examples, it appears that the non-zero sequence in the input grid is shifted one position to the right in the output grid. The zeros at the beginning of the sequence are increased by one, and the sequence is moved to the right by one position.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid.\n\n- **Test Input:**\n  - 0 0 4 3 5 4 9 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n- **Expected Transformation:**\n  - Identify the non-zero sequence: 4 3 5 4 9\n  - Shift this sequence one position to the right: 0 4 3 5 4 9\n  - Fill the remaining positions with zeros.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the output grid.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero index\n    first_non_zero = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), None)\n    # Find the last non-zero index\n    last_non_zero = len(input_grid) - next((i for i, x in enumerate(reversed(input_grid)) if x != 0), None) - 1\n    \n    # Extract the non-zero sequence\n    non_zero_sequence = input_grid[first_non_zero:last_non_zero + 1]\n    \n    # Create the output grid with zeros\n    output_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\n    \n    # Place the non-zero sequence one position to the right\n    output_grid[first_non_zero + 1:first_non_zero + 1 + len(non_zero_sequence)] = non_zero_sequence\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [0, 0, 4, 3, 5, 4, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n# Transform the test input\ntest_output = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(test_output)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output for the test input.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output for the test input. Let's analyze the result:\n\nThe test input was:\n- Input: 0 0 4 3 5 4 9 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe output generated by the code is:\n- Output: 0 0 0 4 3 5 4 9 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThis output matches the expected transformation based on the rule we derived from the examples. The non-zero sequence \"4 3 5 4 9\" was shifted one position to the right, and the zeros were adjusted accordingly.\n\nTherefore, the final answer for the test input is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 4 3 5 4 9 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
