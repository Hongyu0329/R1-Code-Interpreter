    "To solve this problem, we need to identify a pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 5 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 5 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence \"7 5\" is moved to the right by 4 positions.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 7 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 7\n   - **Observation:** The sequence \"1 7\" is moved to the right by 4 positions.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 6 6 1 3 3 6 9 6 4 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 1 3 3 6 9 6 4 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence \"6 6 1 3 3 6 9 6 4\" is moved to the right by 4 positions.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, it seems that the non-zero sequence in the input grid is shifted to the right by 4 positions in the output grid. The zeros at the beginning of the input grid are extended to fill the space left by the shifted sequence.\n\n### Applying the Rule\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- **Test Input:** 7 2 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nWe need to identify the non-zero sequence and shift it to the right by 4 positions.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this process:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero element\n    start_index = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), None)\n    \n    # If no non-zero element is found, return the input grid as is\n    if start_index is None:\n        return input_grid\n    \n    # Extract the non-zero sequence\n    non_zero_sequence = input_grid[start_index:]\n    \n    # Create the output grid with zeros\n    output_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\n    \n    # Place the non-zero sequence shifted by 4 positions\n    output_grid[4:4+len(non_zero_sequence)] = non_zero_sequence\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [7, 2, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nThis script will transform the test input grid according to the derived rule. Let's execute it to get the output.",
    "The code output indicates that the transformation was applied correctly, but the output grid has more elements than expected. This discrepancy is due to the script not accounting for the fixed length of the grid, which should be 18 elements, as seen in the examples.\n\nLet's correct the script to ensure the output grid has the same length as the input grid, which is 18 elements. We will also ensure that the non-zero sequence is shifted correctly within this fixed length.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero element\n    start_index = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), None)\n    \n    # If no non-zero element is found, return the input grid as is\n    if start_index is None:\n        return input_grid\n    \n    # Extract the non-zero sequence\n    non_zero_sequence = input_grid[start_index:]\n    \n    # Create the output grid with zeros\n    output_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\n    \n    # Place the non-zero sequence shifted by 4 positions\n    shift_position = 4\n    output_grid[shift_position:shift_position+len(non_zero_sequence)] = non_zero_sequence[:len(input_grid) - shift_position]\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [7, 2, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nLet's execute this corrected script to get the output.",
    "The code output is now correct, and it matches the expected transformation based on the rule derived from the examples. The non-zero sequence \"7 2 7\" from the input grid has been shifted to the right by 4 positions, resulting in the output grid:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 7 2 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
