    "To solve this problem, we need to identify a pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze each example to find a common rule.\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of 6s is shifted to the right by 4 positions.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0\n   - **Output:** 6 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of 6s is shifted to the left by 3 positions, and the first 6 is moved to the start of the grid.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The single 7 is shifted to the right by 4 positions.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, it seems that the rule involves shifting non-zero sequences within the grid. The shift direction and magnitude depend on the position and length of the non-zero sequence:\n\n- If the sequence is at the start, it shifts to the right.\n- If the sequence is in the middle, it shifts to the right.\n- If the sequence is at the end, it shifts to the left.\n\nThe shift magnitude seems to be related to the position of the first non-zero element.\n\n### Test Input Analysis\n\n- **Test Input:** 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9\n\nLet's apply the derived rule to this test input:\n\n1. Identify the non-zero sequence: 9 9 at the start and a single 9 at the end.\n2. Shift the sequence of 9s at the start to the right by 4 positions.\n3. The single 9 at the end remains in place.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to verify the output.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero element\n    first_non_zero_index = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), None)\n    if first_non_zero_index is None:\n        return input_grid  # No non-zero elements, return as is\n\n    # Find the last non-zero element\n    last_non_zero_index = len(input_grid) - 1 - next((i for i, x in enumerate(reversed(input_grid)) if x != 0), None)\n\n    # Determine the shift amount\n    shift_amount = 4\n\n    # Create a new grid with zeros\n    output_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\n\n    # Shift the sequence to the right\n    for i in range(first_non_zero_index, last_non_zero_index + 1):\n        if input_grid[i] != 0:\n            new_position = i + shift_amount\n            if new_position < len(input_grid):\n                output_grid[new_position] = input_grid[i]\n\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9]\noutput = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output for the test input.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output for the test input is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. This output aligns with the pattern observed in the examples, where the sequence of non-zero numbers is shifted to the right by 4 positions.\n\nTherefore, the predicted output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
