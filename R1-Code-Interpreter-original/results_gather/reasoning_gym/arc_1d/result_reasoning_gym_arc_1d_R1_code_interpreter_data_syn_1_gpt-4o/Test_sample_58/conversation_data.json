    "To solve this problem, we need to identify a pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 8\n- **Output:** 8 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 5 5\n- **Output:** 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 5 5 5 5 5\n\n### Observations:\n1. The input and output grids are both 12 elements long.\n2. The transformation seems to involve shifting or rotating elements.\n3. The zeros in the input grid seem to be moved to different positions in the output grid.\n\n### Hypothesis:\n- The zeros in the input grid are shifted to the leftmost positions in the output grid, and the remaining numbers are shifted to the right.\n\n### Test the Hypothesis:\nLet's apply this hypothesis to the test input grid.\n\n- **Test Input:** 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0\n\nAccording to our hypothesis, the zeros should be moved to the leftmost positions, and the sixes should fill the remaining positions.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Count the number of zeros\n    zero_count = input_grid.count(0)\n    # Count the number of non-zero elements\n    non_zero_elements = [x for x in input_grid if x != 0]\n    # Create the output grid\n    output_grid = [0] * zero_count + non_zero_elements\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nThis code will transform the test input grid according to the identified rule. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matches our hypothesis. The zeros have been moved to the leftmost positions, and the sixes have filled the remaining positions in the grid.\n\nTherefore, the output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6>>>"
