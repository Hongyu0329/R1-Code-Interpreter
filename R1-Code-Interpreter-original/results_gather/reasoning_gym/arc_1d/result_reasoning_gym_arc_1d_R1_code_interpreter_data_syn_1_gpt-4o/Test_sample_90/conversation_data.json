Predict the corresponding output grid by applying the rule you found. Describe how you derived the rule and your overall reasoning process in detail before you submit your answer. Your final answer should be just the test output grid itself.\n\nInput:\n9 9 9 0 9 0 9 9 0 9 9 9 9 0 0 0\nOutput final answer with the format <<<answer>>>",

    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Observations:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 5 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 0 0 0\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 4 4 0 4 0 4 4 4 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 4 0 4 4 0 4 4 4 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 2 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- The input and output grids are 4x4 matrices.\n- The transformation seems to involve changing certain elements from the input to the output.\n- By comparing the input and output grids, we notice that the second element of the first row in each input grid is changed to 0 in the output grid.\n- All other elements remain the same.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n\nFrom the observations, the rule can be described as:\n- Change the second element of the first row to 0.\n- Keep all other elements the same.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n\nGiven the test input grid:\n- **Input:** 9 9 9 0 9 0 9 9 0 9 9 9 9 0 0 0\n\nWe apply the rule:\n- Change the second element of the first row (which is 9) to 0.\n\nThe resulting output grid will be:\n- **Output:** 9 0 9 0 9 0 9 9 0 9 9 9 9 0 0 0\n\nNow, let's output the final answer.\n\n<<<9 0 9 0 9 0 9 9 0 9 9 9 9 0 0 0>>>"
