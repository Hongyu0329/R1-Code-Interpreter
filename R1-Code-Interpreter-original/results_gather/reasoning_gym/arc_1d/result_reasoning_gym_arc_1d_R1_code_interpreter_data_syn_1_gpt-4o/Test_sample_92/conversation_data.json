    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 1 6 3 5 0 8 0 4 6 7 6 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 9 2 0 3 0 4 0 9 8\n   - **Output:** 1 6 3 5 8 0 4 6 7 6 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 9 2 0 3 0 4 0 9 8 0\n   - **Observation:** The first zero in the input is replaced by the first non-zero number that follows it, which is 8. The last element becomes zero.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 8 0 9 0 0 9 0 0 8 0 8 0 0 7 0 6 0 7 8 0 0 2 0 5 2\n   - **Output:** 0 8 0 9 0 0 9 0 0 8 0 8 0 0 7 0 6 0 7 8 0 0 2 0 5 2 0\n   - **Observation:** The first zero is replaced by the first non-zero number that follows it, which is 8. The last element becomes zero.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 9 0 0 4 0 1 2 0 0 3 7 8 0 0 0 0 2 7 6 9 4 0 0 9 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 9 0 4 0 1 2 0 0 3 7 8 0 0 0 0 2 7 6 9 4 0 0 9 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The first zero is replaced by the first non-zero number that follows it, which is 4. The last element becomes zero.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can derive the following rule:\n- Identify the first zero in the input grid.\n- Replace this zero with the first non-zero number that follows it in the grid.\n- The last element of the grid becomes zero.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- **Test Input:** 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 5 2 0 0 0 3 0 8 5 0 0 0 0 0 2 8\n\n1. Identify the first zero, which is at index 1.\n2. The first non-zero number that follows it is 2 (at index 7).\n3. Replace the first zero with 2.\n4. The last element becomes zero.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to generate the output grid.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    output_grid = input_grid[:]\n    first_zero_index = output_grid.index(0)\n    for i in range(first_zero_index + 1, len(output_grid)):\n        if output_grid[i] != 0:\n            output_grid[first_zero_index] = output_grid[i]\n            break\n    output_grid[-1] = 0\n    return output_grid\n\ninput_grid = [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 8, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will get the transformed output grid. Let's see the result.\n\n<<<8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 8, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0>>>",
    "The code executed successfully and produced the expected output grid based on the derived rule. The transformation rule was applied correctly to the test input grid, resulting in the following output:\n\n<<<8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 5, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 8, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0>>>"
