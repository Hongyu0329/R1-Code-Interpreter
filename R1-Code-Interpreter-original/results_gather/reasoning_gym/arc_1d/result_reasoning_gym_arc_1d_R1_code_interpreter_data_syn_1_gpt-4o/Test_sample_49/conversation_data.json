    "To solve this problem, we need to identify a pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples to find a common transformation rule.\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 6 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 6 6 0 6 6 6 0\n   - **Output:** 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 6 6 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 6 6 0 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0\n   - **Output:** 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations\n\n- The output grid seems to be a rearrangement of the input grid.\n- The first few elements of the output grid are non-zero numbers from the input grid, followed by zeros.\n- The non-zero numbers in the output appear to be shifted to the left, maintaining their order from the input.\n\n### Hypothesis\n\nThe rule seems to be:\n1. Extract all non-zero numbers from the input grid.\n2. Place them at the beginning of the output grid in the same order.\n3. Fill the remaining positions in the output grid with zeros.\n\n### Test the Hypothesis\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- **Test Input:** 0 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0 0\n\nFollowing the rule:\n1. Extract non-zero numbers: 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7\n2. Place them at the beginning: 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7\n3. Fill the rest with zeros: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n\nLet's implement this in Python to verify:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    non_zero_elements = [x for x in input_grid if x != 0]\n    zero_count = len(input_grid) - len(non_zero_elements)\n    return non_zero_elements + [0] * zero_count\n\ntest_input = [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the output grid for the test input.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the expected output for the test input grid. The transformation rule we derived appears to be correct. The output grid is formed by moving all non-zero elements from the input grid to the front, maintaining their order, and filling the remaining positions with zeros.\n\nTherefore, the output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
