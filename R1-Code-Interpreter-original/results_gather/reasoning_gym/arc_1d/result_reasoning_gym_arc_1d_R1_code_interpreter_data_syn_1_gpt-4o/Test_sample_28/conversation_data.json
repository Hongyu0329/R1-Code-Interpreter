    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Analysis of Examples\n\n**Example 1:**\n- Input:  1 0 1 1 2 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 2 0 1 0 2 2 0\n- Output: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2\n\n**Example 2:**\n- Input:  0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 2\n- Output: 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2\n\n**Example 3:**\n- Input:  1 0 2 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 2 0 1 1 1 2 0 0 0\n- Output: 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2\n\n### Observations\n1. The output grid always starts with a sequence of `1`s, followed by `0`s, and ends with `2`s.\n2. The number of `1`s in the output seems to be the count of `1`s in the input.\n3. The number of `2`s in the output seems to be the count of `2`s in the input.\n4. The `0`s in the output fill the space between the `1`s and `2`s.\n\n### Rule Derivation\nFrom the observations, we can derive the following rule:\n- Count the number of `1`s in the input grid.\n- Count the number of `2`s in the input grid.\n- Construct the output grid by placing all `1`s first, followed by `0`s, and then all `2`s.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\nLet's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- **Test Input:** 1 0 0 1 2 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 0 2 0 0 2 0\n\n1. Count of `1`s: 4\n2. Count of `2`s: 4\n3. Total length of the grid: 19\n\nThe output grid will have:\n- 4 `1`s\n- 19 - 4 - 4 = 11 `0`s\n- 4 `2`s\n\nLet's generate the output grid using this rule:\n\n```python\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = [1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0]\n\n# Count the number of 1s and 2s\ncount_1 = input_grid.count(1)\ncount_2 = input_grid.count(2)\n\n# Calculate the number of 0s\ncount_0 = len(input_grid) - count_1 - count_2\n\n# Construct the output grid\noutput_grid = [1] * count_1 + [0] * count_0 + [2] * count_2\n\n# Print the output grid\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output grid.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output grid based on the derived rule. The output grid is constructed by placing all `1`s first, followed by `0`s, and then all `2`s, as per the counts found in the input grid.\n\nThe final output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2>>>"
