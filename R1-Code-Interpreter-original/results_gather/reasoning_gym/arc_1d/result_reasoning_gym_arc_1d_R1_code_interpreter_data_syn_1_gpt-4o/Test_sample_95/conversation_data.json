    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 1 1 5 4 7 4 5 5 7 1 6 5 9 2 7 2 2 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 1 1 5 4 7 4 5 5 7 1 6 5 9 2 7 2 2 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n   The first three elements of the input are replaced with zeros in the output.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n   The first 16 elements of the input are replaced with zeros in the output.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 7 5 2 9 2 5 2 5 6 9 1 5 4 7 5 7 4 1 5 3 4 4 8 4 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 7 5 2 9 2 5 2 5 6 9 1 5 4 7 5 7 4 1 5 3 4 4 8 4 0\n\n   The first four elements of the input are replaced with zeros in the output.\n\n### Observed Rule\n\nFrom the examples, it seems that the rule involves replacing a certain number of leading elements in the input with zeros in the output. The number of leading zeros in the output seems to be determined by the position of the first non-zero element in the input.\n\n### Applying the Rule\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 2 8 9 4 2 5 4 7 7 2 9 7 0 0 0\n\nThe first non-zero element in the input is at position 13 (0-indexed), which is the number 3. Therefore, we replace the first 13 elements with zeros in the output.\n\n### Predicting the Output\n\nLet's generate the output for the test input using the identified rule.\n\n```python\ndef transform_input_to_output(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero element\n    first_non_zero_index = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), len(input_grid))\n    # Replace the first 'first_non_zero_index' elements with zeros\n    output_grid = [0] * first_non_zero_index + input_grid[first_non_zero_index:]\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 8, 9, 4, 2, 5, 4, 7, 7, 2, 9, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n# Generate output\ntest_output = transform_input_to_output(test_input)\nprint(test_output)\n```\n\nExecuting the code will give us the predicted output for the test input.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the predicted output for the test input based on the identified rule. The rule involves replacing the leading elements of the input with zeros up to the position of the first non-zero element. \n\nThe predicted output for the test input is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 2 8 9 4 2 5 4 7 7 2 9 7 0 0 0>>>"
