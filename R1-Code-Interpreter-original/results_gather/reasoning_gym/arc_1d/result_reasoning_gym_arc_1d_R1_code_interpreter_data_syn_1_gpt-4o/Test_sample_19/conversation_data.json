    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 9 1 2 1 7 5 7 6 6 9 9 8 9 7 5 9 4 4 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 1 2 1 7 5 7 6 6 9 9 8 9 7 5 9 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of non-zero numbers in the input (9 1 2 1 7 5 7 6 6 9 9 8 9 7 5 9 4 4) is shifted to the left, and the first non-zero number (9) is moved to the end of the output.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 1 4 8 6 5 6 3 8 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 1 4 8 6 5 6 3 8 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of non-zero numbers (8 1 4 8 6 5 6 3 8) is shifted to the left, and the first non-zero number (8) is moved to the end of the output.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 9 3 2 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 9 3 2 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of non-zero numbers (9 3 2 2 1 1) is shifted to the left, and the first non-zero number (9) is moved to the end of the output.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can derive the following rule:\n- Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n- Shift this sequence to the left by one position.\n- Move the first non-zero number to the end of the output grid.\n- The rest of the grid remains filled with zeros.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 8 9 2 8 8 6 3 9 8 2 6 4 7 7\n- **Non-zero sequence:** 1 8 9 2 8 8 6 3 9 8 2 6 4 7 7\n- **Shifted sequence:** 8 9 2 8 8 6 3 9 8 2 6 4 7 7\n- **First non-zero number moved to end:** 8 9 2 8 8 6 3 9 8 2 6 4 7 7 1\n\nNow, let's construct the output grid by placing the shifted sequence and the moved number, followed by zeros to fill the grid.\n\n```python\n# Define the input grid\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 9, 2, 8, 8, 6, 3, 9, 8, 2, 6, 4, 7, 7]\n\n# Find the first non-zero index\nfirst_non_zero_index = next(i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0)\n\n# Extract the non-zero sequence\nnon_zero_sequence = input_grid[first_non_zero_index:]\n\n# Shift the sequence to the left and move the first element to the end\nshifted_sequence = non_zero_sequence[1:] + [non_zero_sequence[0]]\n\n# Construct the output grid\noutput_grid = shifted_sequence + [0] * (len(input_grid) - len(shifted_sequence))\n\n# Print the output grid\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to get the final output grid.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output grid was generated based on the derived rule. The rule involves identifying the sequence of non-zero numbers, shifting them to the left, and moving the first non-zero number to the end of the sequence. The rest of the grid is filled with zeros.\n\nThe final output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<8 9 2 8 8 6 3 9 8 2 6 4 7 7 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
