    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Observations:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: 7 0 0 9 9 9 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 7 0 0 9 9 9 0 3 1 1 3 0 3 2 2 3 0 0 0\n\n   **Pattern:** \n   - The number `3` is inserted after the last occurrence of each non-zero number sequence (9, 1, 2).\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 0 3 7 7 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 6 6 3 0\n\n   **Pattern:**\n   - The number `3` is inserted after the last occurrence of each non-zero number sequence (7, 6).\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 9 9 0 0 1 1 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 3 9 9 3 3 1 1 3 0 0\n\n   **Pattern:**\n   - The number `3` is inserted after the last occurrence of each non-zero number sequence (4, 6, 9, 1).\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n\nFrom the examples, we can derive the following rule:\n- For each contiguous sequence of non-zero numbers in the input grid, insert the number `3` immediately after the sequence in the output grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 5 5\n\nFollowing the rule:\n- After the sequence `6 6 6`, insert `3`.\n- After the sequence `6`, insert `3`.\n- After the sequence `5 5`, insert `3`.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to generate the output grid.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    output_grid = []\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(input_grid):\n        output_grid.append(input_grid[i])\n        if input_grid[i] != 0:\n            # Check if it's the end of a sequence\n            if i == len(input_grid) - 1 or input_grid[i + 1] == 0:\n                output_grid.append(3)\n        i += 1\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nThe code will be executed to provide the output grid.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output grid based on the derived rule. The rule was to insert the number `3` after each contiguous sequence of non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n\nThe output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 6 6 6 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 3 0 0 0 5 5 3>>>"
