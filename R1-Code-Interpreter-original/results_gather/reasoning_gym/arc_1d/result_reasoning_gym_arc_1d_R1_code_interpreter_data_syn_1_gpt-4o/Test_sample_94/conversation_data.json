    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 4 3 8 8 4 3 3 8 2 5 9 3 6 4 8 7 1 7 7 5 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 3 8 8 4 3 3 8 2 5 9 3 6 4 8 7 1 7 7 5 0\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 1 2 5 3 4 4 7 7 4 7 1 4 7 4 1 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 1 2 5 3 4 4 7 7 4 7 1 4 7 4 1 0\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 3 4 3 7 1 6 2 3 8 6 8 7 7 9 5 1 6 1 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 4 3 7 1 6 2 3 8 6 8 7 7 9 5 1 6 1 0\n\n### Observations\n\n- The output grid always starts with a sequence of zeros.\n- The number of leading zeros in the output grid is greater than or equal to the number of leading zeros in the input grid.\n- The non-zero elements in the input grid are shifted to the right in the output grid, maintaining their order.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the observations, we can derive the following rule:\n- Count the number of leading zeros in the input grid.\n- In the output grid, increase the number of leading zeros by the number of non-zero elements that follow the initial zeros in the input grid.\n- Shift the non-zero elements to the right by the difference in the number of leading zeros between the input and output grids.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 8 3 3 1 9 2 5 7 5 2 9 2 8 3 2 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n1. Count the leading zeros in the input: 2 zeros.\n2. Count the non-zero elements following the initial zeros: 17 elements.\n3. The output grid should have 2 + 17 = 19 leading zeros.\n4. Shift the non-zero elements to the right by 17 positions.\n\nLet's compute the output grid using the derived rule:\n\n```python\n# Define the input grid\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 8, 3, 3, 1, 9, 2, 5, 7, 5, 2, 9, 2, 8, 3, 2, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n# Count the number of leading zeros\nleading_zeros = 0\nfor num in input_grid:\n    if num == 0:\n        leading_zeros += 1\n    else:\n        break\n\n# Count the number of non-zero elements after the initial zeros\nnon_zero_elements = input_grid[leading_zeros:]\n\n# Calculate the number of leading zeros in the output\noutput_leading_zeros = leading_zeros + len(non_zero_elements)\n\n# Create the output grid\noutput_grid = [0] * output_leading_zeros + non_zero_elements\n\n# Print the output grid\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output grid.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output grid based on the derived rule. The output grid is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 3 3 1 9 2 5 7 5 2 9 2 8 3 2 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
