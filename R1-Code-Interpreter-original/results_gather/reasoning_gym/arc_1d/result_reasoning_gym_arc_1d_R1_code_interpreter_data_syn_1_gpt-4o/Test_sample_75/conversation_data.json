    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 7 3 5 8 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 3 9 3 4 3 4 6 5 1 5 5 2 9\n   - **Output:** 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 3 9 3 4 3 4 6 5 1 5 5 2 9 7 3 5 8\n\n   Observations:\n   - The first number of the input (7) is moved to the start of the output.\n   - The next 10 numbers in the input are replaced by zeros in the output.\n   - The remaining numbers from the input are shifted to the left by 10 positions in the output.\n   - The first 4 numbers of the input (7, 3, 5, 8) are appended to the end of the output.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 5 4 2 5 8 3 4 8 2 3 2 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 5 4 2 5 8 3 4 8 2 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n   Observations:\n   - The first 10 numbers of the input are zeros and remain zeros in the output.\n   - The next 4 numbers (7, 5, 4, 2) are moved to the start of the output after the zeros.\n   - The remaining numbers are shifted to the left by 10 positions.\n   - The first 4 numbers of the input (0, 0, 0, 0) are appended to the end of the output.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 2 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 2 4 4 3 5 7 1 5 5 7 5\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 2 4 4 3 5 7 1 5 5 7 5 2 4 0 0\n\n   Observations:\n   - The first 10 numbers of the input are zeros in the output.\n   - The next 4 numbers (8, 2, 4, 4) are moved to the start of the output after the zeros.\n   - The remaining numbers are shifted to the left by 10 positions.\n   - The first 4 numbers of the input (2, 4, 0, 0) are appended to the end of the output.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can derive the following rule:\n- The first 10 numbers of the input are replaced by zeros in the output.\n- The next 4 numbers are moved to the start of the output after the zeros.\n- The remaining numbers are shifted to the left by 10 positions.\n- The first 4 numbers of the input are appended to the end of the output.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n- **Input:** 5 5 9 7 4 1 5 6 9 2 7 8 1 7 1 6 8 9 9 8 8 5 4 7 4 9 6 7 7\n\nFollowing the rule:\n- Replace the first 10 numbers with zeros: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- Move the next 4 numbers (7, 8, 1, 7) to the start of the output after the zeros.\n- Shift the remaining numbers (1, 6, 8, 9, 9, 8, 8, 5, 4, 7, 4, 9, 6, 7, 7) to the left by 10 positions.\n- Append the first 4 numbers of the input (5, 5, 9, 7) to the end of the output.\n\nLet's compute the output using the derived rule:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # First 10 numbers are replaced by zeros\n    output_grid = [0] * 10\n    \n    # Next 4 numbers are moved to the start of the output after the zeros\n    output_grid.extend(input_grid[10:14])\n    \n    # Remaining numbers are shifted to the left by 10 positions\n    output_grid.extend(input_grid[14:])\n    \n    # First 4 numbers of the input are appended to the end of the output\n    output_grid.extend(input_grid[:4])\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [5, 5, 9, 7, 4, 1, 5, 6, 9, 2, 7, 8, 1, 7, 1, 6, 8, 9, 9, 8, 8, 5, 4, 7, 4, 9, 6, 7, 7]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output grid.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output grid was generated based on the derived rule. The transformation rule was applied correctly to the test input grid, resulting in the following output grid:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 1 7 1 6 8 9 9 8 8 5 4 7 4 9 6 7 7 5 5 9 7>>>"
