    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Transformation:** The sequence of 7s is shifted to the left by one position, and the trailing zeros are adjusted accordingly.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Transformation:** The sequence of 7s is shifted to the left by two positions, and the trailing zeros are adjusted accordingly.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0\n   - **Transformation:** The sequence of 4s is shifted to the left by one position, and the trailing zeros are adjusted accordingly.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers.\n- Shift this sequence to the left by one position.\n- Fill the remaining positions with zeros.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Transformation:**\n  - Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers: [3]\n  - Shift this sequence to the left by one position: [0, 3]\n  - Fill the remaining positions with zeros: [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to verify the transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero element\n    first_non_zero_index = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), None)\n    \n    if first_non_zero_index is None:\n        return input_grid  # No non-zero element found, return the input as is\n    \n    # Find the sequence of non-zero numbers\n    non_zero_sequence = []\n    for i in range(first_non_zero_index, len(input_grid)):\n        if input_grid[i] != 0:\n            non_zero_sequence.append(input_grid[i])\n        else:\n            break\n    \n    # Shift the sequence to the left by one position\n    output_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\n    output_grid[1:1+len(non_zero_sequence)] = non_zero_sequence\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output for the test input.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output for the test input. Based on the transformation rule we derived, the sequence of non-zero numbers is shifted to the left by one position, and the remaining positions are filled with zeros.\n\nThe output for the test input grid is:\n\n<<<0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
