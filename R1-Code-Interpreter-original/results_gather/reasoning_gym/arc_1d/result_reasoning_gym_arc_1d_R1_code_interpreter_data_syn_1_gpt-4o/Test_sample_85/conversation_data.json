    "To solve this problem, we need to identify a pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze each example to find a common rule:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 3 7 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 3 7 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence \"9 3 7\" is moved from the middle to the leftmost non-zero position.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 6 6 9 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 1 8\n   - **Output:** 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 1 8 6 6 9\n   - **Observation:** The sequence \"3 1 8\" is moved to the leftmost non-zero position, and the sequence \"6 6 9\" is moved to the rightmost position.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 7 7 7 7 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence \"7 7 7 7 3 2\" is moved to the leftmost position.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, it seems the rule involves identifying a sequence of non-zero numbers and moving them to the leftmost position in the output grid. The remaining numbers are shifted to the right, maintaining their order.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0\n- **Expected Output:** The sequence \"7\" should be moved to the leftmost position.\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to apply this rule to the test input.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Extract non-zero elements\n    non_zero_elements = [x for x in input_grid if x != 0]\n    # Calculate the number of zeros to append\n    num_zeros = len(input_grid) - len(non_zero_elements)\n    # Create the output grid\n    output_grid = non_zero_elements + [0] * num_zeros\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0]\n# Transform the grid\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the output for the test input.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output for the test input. Based on the rule derived from the examples, the sequence of non-zero numbers is moved to the leftmost position, and the remaining positions are filled with zeros.\n\nThe output for the test input grid is:\n\n<<<7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
