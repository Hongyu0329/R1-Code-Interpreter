    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of 1s is shifted to the right by 5 positions.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of 6s is shifted to the right by 8 positions.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of 1s is shifted to the right by 7 positions.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, it seems that the non-zero sequence in the input is shifted to the right by a certain number of positions in the output. The number of positions seems to be related to the position of the first non-zero element in the input.\n\n- In Example 1, the first non-zero element (1) starts at position 1, and the shift is 5 positions.\n- In Example 2, the first non-zero element (6) starts at position 8, and the shift is 8 positions.\n- In Example 3, the first non-zero element (1) starts at position 13, and the shift is 7 positions.\n\nThe shift seems to be the difference between the position of the first non-zero element and a fixed position (possibly the end of the grid minus the length of the non-zero sequence).\n\n### Applying the Rule\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- The first non-zero element (3) starts at position 9.\n- The length of the non-zero sequence is 3.\n- The grid length is 30.\n- The shift should be calculated as: `grid_length - (start_position + sequence_length)`\n\nLet's calculate the shift and apply it to the test input using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Define the test input\ntest_input = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n# Find the first non-zero element and its position\nstart_position = next((i for i, x in enumerate(test_input) if x != 0), None)\nsequence_length = sum(1 for x in test_input if x != 0)\ngrid_length = len(test_input)\n\n# Calculate the shift\nshift = grid_length - (start_position + sequence_length)\n\n# Create the output grid\noutput_grid = [0] * grid_length\nfor i in range(sequence_length):\n    output_grid[start_position + shift + i] = test_input[start_position + i]\n\n# Print the output grid\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output grid.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output grid. Based on the analysis and the code execution, the rule involves shifting the non-zero sequence to the right by a calculated number of positions. The shift is determined by the difference between the grid length and the sum of the starting position and the sequence length.\n\nThe output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3>>>"
