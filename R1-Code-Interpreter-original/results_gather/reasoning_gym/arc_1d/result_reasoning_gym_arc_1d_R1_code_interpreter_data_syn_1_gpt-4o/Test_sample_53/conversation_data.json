    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples one by one:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 6\n- **Output:** 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 6 6 6\n\nThe transformation here seems to involve shifting the last few elements to the right. Specifically, the two zeros and the last six are shifted to the right by one position.\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n- **Output:** 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n\nIn this case, there is no change between the input and output, indicating that the rule might not apply when the grid is uniform.\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n- **Output:** 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n\nHere, the zeros are shifted to the left, and the sixes are shifted to the right, indicating a more complex transformation.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\nFrom the examples, it seems the rule involves shifting non-zero elements to the right and zero elements to the left, but only when there is a mix of zeros and non-zeros. If the grid is uniform, no change is made.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nFollowing the rule, we should shift the zeros to the left and the sevens to the right. Let's implement this in code to verify:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Count the number of zeros\n    zero_count = input_grid.count(0)\n    # Count the number of non-zeros\n    non_zero_count = len(input_grid) - zero_count\n    # Create the output grid with zeros on the left and non-zeros on the right\n    output_grid = [0] * zero_count + [7] * non_zero_count\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the output grid.",
    "The code output indicates that the zeros are placed at the beginning, and the sevens are placed at the end. However, this does not match the pattern observed in the examples, where the zeros and non-zeros are shifted in a more nuanced manner.\n\nLet's refine our understanding and approach:\n\n### Observations:\n1. In Example 1, the zeros and the last non-zero element are shifted to the right by one position.\n2. In Example 3, the zeros are shifted to the left, and the non-zero elements are shifted to the right.\n\n### Revised Rule:\n- If there are trailing zeros, they are shifted to the left, and the non-zero elements are shifted to the right.\n- If there are leading zeros, they are shifted to the right, and the non-zero elements are shifted to the left.\n\nLet's implement this revised rule in code:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero element from the left\n    first_non_zero_index = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), None)\n    # Find the first zero element from the right\n    first_zero_index_from_right = next((i for i, x in enumerate(reversed(input_grid)) if x == 0), None)\n    \n    if first_non_zero_index is not None and first_zero_index_from_right is not None:\n        # Calculate the actual index from the right\n        first_zero_index_from_right = len(input_grid) - 1 - first_zero_index_from_right\n        \n        # If zeros are at the start, shift them to the right\n        if first_non_zero_index > 0:\n            output_grid = input_grid[first_non_zero_index:] + input_grid[:first_non_zero_index]\n        # If zeros are at the end, shift them to the left\n        elif first_zero_index_from_right < len(input_grid) - 1:\n            output_grid = input_grid[first_zero_index_from_right + 1:] + input_grid[:first_zero_index_from_right + 1]\n        else:\n            output_grid = input_grid\n    else:\n        output_grid = input_grid\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the correct output grid.",
    "The code output shows that the zeros are shifted to the right, and the sevens are shifted to the left. This is consistent with the pattern observed in the examples, where zeros are moved to one side and non-zero elements to the other.\n\n### Final Rule:\n- If there are leading zeros, they are shifted to the right, and the non-zero elements are shifted to the left.\n- If there are trailing zeros, they are shifted to the left, and the non-zero elements are shifted to the right.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\nGiven the test input, the zeros at the beginning are shifted to the right, and the sevens are shifted to the left, resulting in the output grid.\n\n<<<7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
