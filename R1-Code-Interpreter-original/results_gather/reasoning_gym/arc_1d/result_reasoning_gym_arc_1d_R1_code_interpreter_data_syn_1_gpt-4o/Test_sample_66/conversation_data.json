    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The input and output are identical.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The input and output are identical.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n   - **Output:** 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of 8s is shifted to the left, and the trailing 8s are replaced with 0s.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, it seems that the rule involves shifting a sequence of repeated numbers to the left until it encounters a non-zero number, and then replacing the trailing numbers with 0s. However, if the sequence is already at the leftmost position or surrounded by zeros, no change is made.\n\n### Test Input Analysis\n\n- **Test Input:** 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0\n\nLet's apply the derived rule to this test input:\n\n1.
