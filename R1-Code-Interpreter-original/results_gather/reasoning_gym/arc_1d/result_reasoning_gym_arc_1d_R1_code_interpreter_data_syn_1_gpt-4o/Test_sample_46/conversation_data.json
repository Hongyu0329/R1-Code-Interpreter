    "To solve this problem, we need to identify a pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples one by one:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5\n- **Output:** 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n- **Output:** 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0\n- **Output:** 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 7\n\n### Observations:\n1. The input and output grids have the same length.\n2. The transformation seems to involve shifting or rotating elements.\n3. The first few elements of the input grid are shifted to the end of the output grid.\n4. The number of elements shifted seems to be related to the number of trailing zeros in the input grid.\n\n### Hypothesis:\n- The rule involves shifting the first `n` non-zero elements to the end of the grid, where `n` is the number of trailing zeros in the input grid.\n\n### Test Input:\n- **Input:** 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n\n### Applying the Rule:\n- There are no trailing zeros in the test input, so no elements should be shifted.\n- The output should be the same as the input.\n\nLet's verify this hypothesis by applying it to the test input using a Python script.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Count trailing zeros\n    trailing_zeros = 0\n    for num in reversed(input_grid):\n        if num == 0:\n            trailing_zeros += 1\n        else:\n            break\n    \n    # Shift the first `trailing_zeros` elements to the end\n    if trailing_zeros > 0:\n        return input_grid[trailing_zeros:] + input_grid[:trailing_zeros]\n    else:\n        return input_grid\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]\n# Transform the test input\ntest_output = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(test_output)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors, and the output matches our expectations based on the hypothesis. The test input grid `[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]` remains unchanged in the output because there are no trailing zeros to dictate a shift.\n\nTherefore, the final output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4>>>"
