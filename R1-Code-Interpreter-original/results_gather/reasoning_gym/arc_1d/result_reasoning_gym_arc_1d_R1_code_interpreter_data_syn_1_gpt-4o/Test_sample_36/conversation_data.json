    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 4 4 0 4 4 4 4 4 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 4 4 0 4 4 4 4 4 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 6 6 6 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0\n\n### Observations:\n1. The input and output grids are 5x5 matrices.\n2. The transformation seems to involve changing a specific row of numbers to 1s.\n3. In each example, the third row of the input grid is transformed to 1s in the output grid.\n4. The rest of the grid remains unchanged.\n\n### Rule:\n- Transform the third row of the input grid to 1s in the output grid.\n- Keep all other elements the same.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\nLet's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0\n\nWe'll transform the third row to 1s and keep the rest unchanged.\n\nLet's write a Python script to apply this rule to the test input grid.\n\n```python\n# Define the input grid\ninput_grid = [\n    0, 0, 0, 9, 9,\n    9, 9, 0, 0, 9,\n    9, 9, 9, 9, 9,\n    0, 0, 0, 9, 9,\n    9, 9, 0, 0, 0\n]\n\n# Transform the third row to 1s\noutput_grid = input_grid[:10] + [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] + input_grid[15:]\n\n# Print the output grid\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the transformed output grid.",
    "The code executed successfully and transformed the third row of the input grid to 1s, while keeping the rest of the grid unchanged. This matches the rule we identified from the examples.\n\nThe output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 9 9 9 9 0 0 9 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 0 0 0>>>"
