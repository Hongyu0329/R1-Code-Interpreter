    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 6 2 6 2 5 5 8 6 8 5 7 1 7 8 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 7 1 7 5 8 6 8 5 5 2 6 2 6 9 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence from the 11th position to the 26th position is reversed.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 3 5 6 2 8 5 1 4 6 7 1 1 1 4 4 2 1 1 8 5 1 8 4 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 4 8 1 5 8 1 1 2 4 4 1 1 1 7 6 4 1 5 8 2 6 5 3 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence from the 1st position to the 24th position is reversed.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 3 3 5 6 2 7 2 4 6 6 6 1 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 8 1 6 6 6 4 2 7 2 6 5 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence from the 3rd position to the 16th position is reversed.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, it seems that the rule involves reversing a specific segment of the input grid. The segment to be reversed starts from the first non-zero number and ends at the last non-zero number in the input grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nGiven the test input:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe non-zero segment is from the 11th position to the 12th position. Reversing this segment gives us the output.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to confirm our understanding and predict the output for the test input.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first and last non-zero indices\n    first_non_zero = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), None)\n    last_non_zero = next((i for i, x in enumerate(reversed(input_grid)) if x != 0), None)\n    if last_non_zero is not None:\n        last_non_zero = len(input_grid) - 1 - last_non_zero\n    \n    # Reverse the segment between first and last non-zero indices\n    if first_non_zero is not None and last_non_zero is not None:\n        input_grid[first_non_zero:last_non_zero+1] = input_grid[first_non_zero:last_non_zero+1][::-1]\n    \n    return input_grid\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nThe code will reverse the segment of the test input grid that contains non-zero values and print the resulting output grid.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output grid by reversing the segment of the test input grid that contains non-zero values. The output grid is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
