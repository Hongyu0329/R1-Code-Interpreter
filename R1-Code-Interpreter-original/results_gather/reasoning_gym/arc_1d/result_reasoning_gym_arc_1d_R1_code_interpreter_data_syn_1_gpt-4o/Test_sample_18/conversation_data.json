    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 8 8 2 2 2 0 0 0 8 8 8 2 2 2 2 0 0 0\n\nObservations:\n- The first two '2's in the input are transformed into '8's in the output.\n- The first two '2's in the second row are also transformed into '8's.\n- The rest of the '2's remain unchanged.\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 8 2 2 0 0 8 8 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nObservations:\n- The first '2' in the first row is transformed into '8'.\n- The first two '2's in the second row are transformed into '8's.\n- The rest of the '2's remain unchanged.\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 8 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 2 2 2\n\nObservations:\n- The first '2' in the first row is transformed into '8'.\n- The first three '2's in the second row are transformed into '8's.\n- The rest of the '2's remain unchanged.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\nFrom the examples, it seems that the rule involves transforming the first few '2's in each row into '8's. The number of '2's transformed into '8's seems to depend on the position and possibly the number of '2's in the row.\n\n### Test Input Analysis:\n- **Input:** 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nLet's apply the derived rule:\n- Transform the first two '2's in the first row into '8's.\n- Transform the first two '2's in the second row into '8's.\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to apply this rule to the test input:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    output_grid = input_grid[:]\n    # Transform the first two '2's in the first row\n    for i in range(2):\n        if output_grid[i] == 2:\n            output_grid[i] = 8\n    # Transform the first two '2's in the second row\n    for i in range(6, 8):\n        if output_grid[i] == 2:\n            output_grid[i] = 8\n    return output_grid\n\ninput_grid = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the output grid.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output grid was generated based on the derived rule. The transformation rule applied was to change the first two '2's in each row to '8's. \n\nThe output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<8 8 2 2 2 0 0 8 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
