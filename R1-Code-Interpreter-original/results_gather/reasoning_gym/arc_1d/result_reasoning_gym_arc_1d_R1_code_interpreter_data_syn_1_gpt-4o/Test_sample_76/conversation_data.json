    "To solve this problem, we need to identify a pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 5 5 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 5 5\n- **Output:** 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 5\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0\n\n### Observations:\n1. The input and output grids have the same length.\n2. The transformation seems to involve shifting a segment of the grid.\n3. In each example, a segment of the grid is shifted one position to the right.\n4. The segment that is shifted appears to be the longest contiguous sequence of non-zero numbers.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n- Identify the longest contiguous sequence of non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n- Shift this sequence one position to the right in the output grid.\n- The rest of the grid remains unchanged.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6\n- The longest contiguous sequence of non-zero numbers is \"6 6 6\".\n- Shift this sequence one position to the right.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to predict the output grid for the test input.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the longest contiguous sequence of non-zero numbers\n    max_start = max_end = start = 0\n    max_length = 0\n    in_sequence = False\n    \n    for i, num in enumerate(input_grid):\n        if num != 0:\n            if not in_sequence:\n                start = i\n                in_sequence = True\n            if i == len(input_grid) - 1 or input_grid[i + 1] == 0:\n                end = i\n                length = end - start + 1\n                if length > max_length:\n                    max_length = length\n                    max_start = start\n                    max_end = end\n                in_sequence = False\n    \n    # Create the output grid\n    output_grid = input_grid[:]\n    if max_length > 0:\n        # Shift the sequence one position to the right\n        output_grid[max_start:max_end + 1] = [0] + input_grid[max_start:max_end]\n        output_grid[max_start - 1] = input_grid[max_end]\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]\noutput = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output for the test input.",

This does not align with the pattern observed in the examples.\n\n### Corrected Logic:\n- Identify the longest contiguous sequence of non-zero numbers.\n- Shift this sequence one position to the right, ensuring the rest of the grid remains unchanged.\n\nLet's correct the code to implement this logic properly.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the longest contiguous sequence of non-zero numbers\n    max_start = max_end = start = 0\n    max_length = 0\n    in_sequence = False\n    \n    for i, num in enumerate(input_grid):\n        if num != 0:\n            if not in_sequence:\n                start = i\n                in_sequence = True\n            if i == len(input_grid) - 1 or input_grid[i + 1] == 0:\n                end = i\n                length = end - start + 1\n                if length > max_length:\n                    max_length = length\n                    max_start = start\n                    max_end = end\n                in_sequence = False\n    \n    # Create the output grid\n    output_grid = input_grid[:]\n    if max_length > 0:\n        # Shift the sequence one position to the right\n        output_grid[max_start + 1:max_end + 2] = input_grid[max_start:max_end + 1]\n        output_grid[max_start] = 0\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]\noutput = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nLet's execute the corrected code to get the output for the test input.",
