    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 2 2 5 9 5 9 6 3 1 8 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 8 2 6 5 1\n   - **Output:** 9 5 9 6 3 1 8 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 8 2 6 5 1 2 2 5\n   - **Observation:** The output seems to be a rotation of the input. The first three numbers of the input (2, 2, 5) are moved to the end of the output.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 9 6 8 6 8 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 1 4 5 5 7 6\n   - **Output:** 6 8 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 1 4 5 5 7 6 9 6 8\n   - **Observation:** The first three numbers of the input (9, 6, 8) are moved to the end of the output.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 9 8 7 1 8 3 7 1 6 7 6 7 9 8 5 8 2 2 0 0 0 5\n   - **Output:** 1 8 3 7 1 6 7 6 7 9 8 5 8 2 2 0 0 0 5 9 8 7\n   - **Observation:** The first three numbers of the input (9, 8, 7) are moved to the end of the output.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the rule:\n- The first three numbers of the input grid are moved to the end of the output grid.\n- The rest of the numbers are shifted to the left by three positions.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n- **Test Input:** 3 7 4 4 7 9 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 2 8 1\n- **Transformation:**\n  - Move the first three numbers (3, 7, 4) to the end.\n  - Shift the rest of the numbers to the left by three positions.\n\nLet's implement this transformation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Move the first three numbers to the end\n    return input_grid[3:] + input_grid[:3]\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [3, 7, 4, 4, 7, 9, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 2, 8, 1]\n# Apply the transformation\noutput_grid = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the transformed output grid for the test input.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matches the expected transformation based on the rule we derived. The first three numbers of the input grid were moved to the end, and the rest of the numbers were shifted to the left by three positions.\n\nTherefore, the output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<4 7 9 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 2 8 1 3 7 4>>>"
