    "To solve this problem, we need to identify a pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples to find a consistent transformation rule.\n\n### Analysis of Examples\n\n#### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2 2 1 0 2 2 1 2 2 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n#### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 1 2 2 2 2 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 2 1 2\n- **Output:** 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1\n\n#### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 2 1 0 0 1 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 1\n- **Output:** 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n### Observations:\n1. The output grid always starts with a sequence of 2s.\n2. The number of 2s at the beginning of the output seems to be equal to the number of 2s in the input grid.\n3. After the initial sequence of 2s, there is a sequence of 0s.\n4. The number of 0s in the output grid seems to be equal to the number of 0s in the input grid.\n5. The output grid ends with a sequence of 1s.\n6. The number of 1s at the end of the output grid seems to be equal to the number of 1s in the input grid.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n- Count the number of 2s, 0s, and 1s in the input grid.\n- Construct the output grid by placing the counted number of 2s first, followed by the counted number of 0s, and finally the counted number of 1s.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\nLet's apply this rule to the test input grid.\n\n#### Test Input:\n- **Input:** 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 2 0 0 0 0\n\nWe will write a Python script to count the occurrences of 2s, 0s, and 1s in the input grid and construct the output grid accordingly.\n\n```python\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = [2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n# Count occurrences of 2s, 0s, and 1s\ncount_2 = input_grid.count(2)\ncount_0 = input_grid.count(0)\ncount_1 = input_grid.count(1)\n\n# Construct the output grid\noutput_grid = [2] * count_2 + [0] * count_0 + [1] * count_1\n\n# Print the output grid\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output grid for the test input.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output grid based on the rule we derived. The output grid is constructed by counting the occurrences of 2s, 0s, and 1s in the input grid and arranging them in the order of 2s, followed by 0s, and then 1s.\n\nThe final output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<[2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]>>>"
