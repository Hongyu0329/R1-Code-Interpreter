    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 7 7 7 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 1 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of '7's is shifted left to start immediately after the first non-zero number (1).\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 1 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 1 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** No change is needed as the sequence of '3's already starts immediately after the first non-zero number (1).\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 1 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n   - **Output:** 1 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of '7's is shifted left to start immediately after the first non-zero number (1), and the trailing zero is added at the end.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can derive the following rule:\n- Identify the first non-zero number in the input grid.\n- Shift any sequence of non-zero numbers (other than the first identified number) to start immediately after the first non-zero number.\n- Fill the remaining positions with zeros.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- **Input:** 1 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSteps:\n1. Identify the first non-zero number: 1.\n2. Shift the sequence of '9's to start immediately after '1'.\n3. Fill the remaining positions with zeros.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the output grid.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero number\n    first_non_zero_index = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), None)\n    \n    if first_non_zero_index is None:\n        return input_grid  # If no non-zero number is found, return the input as is\n    \n    # Extract the first non-zero number\n    first_non_zero = input_grid[first_non_zero_index]\n    \n    # Find the sequence of non-zero numbers after the first non-zero number\n    non_zero_sequence = [x for x in input_grid[first_non_zero_index + 1:] if x != 0]\n    \n    # Construct the output grid\n    output_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\n    output_grid[0] = first_non_zero\n    output_grid[1:1 + len(non_zero_sequence)] = non_zero_sequence\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [1, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output grid for the test input.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output grid for the test input is `[1, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. This output is consistent with the rule we derived from the examples.\n\n### Explanation of the Output\n- The first non-zero number in the input grid is `1`.\n- The sequence of non-zero numbers after the first non-zero number is `9`.\n- The sequence `9` is shifted to start immediately after `1`.\n- The remaining positions are filled with zeros.\n\nThus, the transformation rule has been correctly applied to the test input.\n\n<<<[1, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]>>>"
