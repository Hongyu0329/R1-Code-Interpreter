    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n\n   Observations:\n   - The sequence of 5s is shifted to the right by 2 positions.\n   - The leading zeros are increased from 2 to 4.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0\n\n   Observations:\n   - The sequence of 4s is shifted to the right by 1 position.\n   - The leading zeros are increased from 3 to 5.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n   Observations:\n   - The sequence of 2s is shifted to the right by 2 positions.\n   - The leading zeros are increased from 11 to 13.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers.\n- Shift this sequence to the right by a certain number of positions.\n- The number of positions to shift seems to be related to the number of leading zeros in the input.\n- Increase the number of leading zeros by the number of positions the sequence is shifted.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\n**Test Input:**\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0\n\n- Identify the sequence of 5s.\n- The sequence of 5s starts at index 10.\n- Shift the sequence of 5s to the right by 2 positions.\n- Increase the leading zeros from 10 to 12.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to generate the output grid.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero element\n    first_non_zero_index = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), None)\n    if first_non_zero_index is None:\n        return input_grid  # No non-zero elements, return as is\n\n    # Find the last non-zero element\n    last_non_zero_index = len(input_grid) - next((i for i, x in enumerate(reversed(input_grid)) if x != 0), None) - 1\n\n    # Extract the sequence of non-zero elements\n    non_zero_sequence = input_grid[first_non_zero_index:last_non_zero_index + 1]\n\n    # Calculate the number of leading zeros in the input\n    leading_zeros = first_non_zero_index\n\n    # Calculate the new number of leading zeros\n    new_leading_zeros = leading_zeros + 2\n\n    # Create the new output grid\n    output_grid = [0] * new_leading_zeros + non_zero_sequence + [0] * (len(input_grid) - new_leading_zeros - len(non_zero_sequence))\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output grid.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output grid based on the derived rule. The sequence of 5s was shifted to the right by 2 positions, and the number of leading zeros was increased accordingly.\n\nThe final output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0>>>"
