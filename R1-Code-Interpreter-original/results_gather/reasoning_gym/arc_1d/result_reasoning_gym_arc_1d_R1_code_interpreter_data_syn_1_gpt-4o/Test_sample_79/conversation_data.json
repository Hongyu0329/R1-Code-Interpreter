    "To solve this problem, we need to identify a pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze each example to find a common rule.\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 7 7\n   - **Output:** 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of zeros in the middle of the input is shifted to the left by 4 positions in the output.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of zeros at the start of the input is shifted to the right by 4 positions in the output.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of nines at the start of the input is shifted to the right by 4 positions in the output.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, it seems that the transformation involves shifting a block of non-zero numbers by 4 positions, either to the left or right, depending on their initial position. The zeros are moved accordingly to maintain the grid's length.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe sequence of eights is initially positioned starting from the 8th position. According to the rule, we should shift this block of eights to the left by 4 positions.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the output grid.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero element\n    first_non_zero = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), None)\n    if first_non_zero is None:\n        return input_grid  # If all are zeros, return as is\n\n    # Find the last non-zero element\n    last_non_zero = len(input_grid) - next((i for i, x in enumerate(reversed(input_grid)) if x != 0), None) - 1\n\n    # Determine the block to shift\n    block = input_grid[first_non_zero:last_non_zero + 1]\n\n    # Shift the block 4 positions to the left\n    new_position = max(0, first_non_zero - 4)\n    output_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\n    output_grid[new_position:new_position + len(block)] = block\n\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nThe code will execute and provide the output grid based on the derived rule.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output grid based on the derived rule. The transformation involved shifting the block of eights 4 positions to the left, as observed in the examples.\n\nThe final output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
