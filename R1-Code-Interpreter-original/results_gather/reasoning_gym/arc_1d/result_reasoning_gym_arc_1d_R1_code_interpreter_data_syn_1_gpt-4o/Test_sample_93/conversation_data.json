    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 2 7 9 8 3 2 1 5 3 6 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 9 8 3 2 1 5 3 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 7\n   - **Observation:** The sequence `2 7` from the input is moved to the end of the output. The rest of the numbers are shifted to the left.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 9 5 1 3 8 3 8 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n   - **Output:** 8 3 8 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 9 5 1 3\n   - **Observation:** The sequence `9 5 1 3` from the input is moved to the end of the output. The rest of the numbers are shifted to the left.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence `3` from the input is moved to the end of the output. The rest of the numbers are shifted to the left.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, it seems that the rule involves identifying a sequence of non-zero numbers at the beginning of the input and moving them to the end of the output. The rest of the numbers are shifted to the left to fill the gap.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 2 7 0\n\n1. Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers at the beginning: `7 2 7`.\n2. Move this sequence to the end of the output.\n3. Shift the rest of the numbers to the left.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to verify and generate the output.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero sequence\n    non_zero_sequence = []\n    for num in input_grid:\n        if num != 0:\n            non_zero_sequence.append(num)\n        elif non_zero_sequence:\n            break\n    \n    # Create the output grid\n    output_grid = input_grid[len(non_zero_sequence):] + non_zero_sequence\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 2, 7, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output for the test input.",
    "The code output indicates that the transformation logic needs adjustment. Let's revisit the rule and correct the implementation.\n\n### Corrected Rule Derivation\n\nUpon reviewing the examples, it seems the rule involves identifying the sequence of non-zero numbers at the end of the input and moving them to the beginning of the output. The rest of the numbers are shifted to the right.\n\n### Corrected Implementation\n\nLet's correct the implementation to reflect this understanding:\n\n1. Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers at the end of the input.\n2. Move this sequence to the beginning of the output.\n3. Shift the rest of the numbers to the right.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the last non-zero sequence\n    non_zero_sequence = []\n    for num in reversed(input_grid):\n        if num != 0:\n            non_zero_sequence.append(num)\n        elif non_zero_sequence:\n            break\n    \n    # Reverse the non-zero sequence to maintain the original order\n    non_zero_sequence.reverse()\n    \n    # Create the output grid\n    output_grid = non_zero_sequence + input_grid[:-len(non_zero_sequence)]\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 2, 7, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the corrected code to get the output for the test input.",
    "The code output is not matching the expected pattern. Let's re-evaluate the examples and the transformation logic.\n\n### Re-evaluation of the Rule\n\nUpon closer inspection, the rule seems to involve identifying the sequence of non-zero numbers at the end of the input and moving them to the beginning of the output. The rest of the numbers are shifted to the right, but the sequence should be the last non-zero sequence from the input.\n\n### Corrected Implementation\n\nLet's correct the implementation to reflect this understanding:\n\n1.
