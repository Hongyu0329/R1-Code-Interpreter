    "To solve this problem, we need to identify a pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples to find a consistent transformation rule.\n\n### Observations:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 1 2 1 2 0 0 2 2\n   - Output: 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: 2 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 2 1 0\n   - Output: 2 2 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: 0 1 1 2 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 1\n   - Output: 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- The output grid always starts with a sequence of 2s followed by 1s and then 0s.\n- The number of 2s in the output seems to be related to the number of 2s in the input.\n- The number of 1s in the output seems to be related to the number of 1s in the input.\n- The rest of the output is filled with 0s.\n\n### Hypothesis:\n\n- Count the number of 2s in the input grid. This count determines the number of 2s at the start of the output grid.\n- Count the number of 1s in the input grid. This count determines the number of 1s following the 2s in the output grid.\n- Fill the remaining positions in the output grid with 0s.\n\n### Implementation:\n\nLet's implement this hypothesis in Python to predict the output for the test input grid.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    count_2 = input_grid.count(2)\n    count_1 = input_grid.count(1)\n    output_grid = [2] * count_2 + [1] * count_1 + [0] * (len(input_grid) - count_2 - count_1)\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = [0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the predicted output grid for the test input.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output grid based on the rule we derived from the examples. The output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<2 2 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
