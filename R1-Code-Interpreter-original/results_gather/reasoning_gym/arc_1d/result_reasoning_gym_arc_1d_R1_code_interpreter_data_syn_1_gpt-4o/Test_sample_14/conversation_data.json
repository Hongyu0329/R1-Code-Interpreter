    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of '4's is shifted to the leftmost position.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of '9's is shifted to the leftmost position, maintaining the number of leading and trailing zeros.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of '2's is shifted to the leftmost position, maintaining the number of leading and trailing zeros.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can derive the following rule:\n- Identify the contiguous sequence of non-zero numbers.\n- Shift this sequence to the leftmost position in the grid.\n- Maintain the number of leading and trailing zeros as in the original grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n- **Expected Transformation:**\n  - Identify the sequence of '1's.\n  - Shift this sequence to the leftmost position.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to predict the output grid.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero element\n    start = 0\n    while start < len(input_grid) and input_grid[start] == 0:\n        start += 1\n    \n    # Find the last non-zero element\n    end = len(input_grid) - 1\n    while end >= 0 and input_grid[end] == 0:\n        end -= 1\n    \n    # Extract the non-zero sequence\n    non_zero_sequence = input_grid[start:end+1]\n    \n    # Calculate the number of leading and trailing zeros\n    leading_zeros = start\n    trailing_zeros = len(input_grid) - end - 1\n    \n    # Create the output grid\n    output_grid = [0] * leading_zeros + non_zero_sequence + [0] * trailing_zeros\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\noutput = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nThis code will execute and provide the predicted output grid for the test input.",
    "The code output matches the test input, which indicates that the transformation rule was not applied correctly. Let's revisit the rule and correct the implementation.\n\n### Correct Rule Application\n\nThe rule should shift the sequence of non-zero numbers to the leftmost position, while maintaining the number of leading and trailing zeros. Let's correct the implementation:\n\n1. Identify the contiguous sequence of non-zero numbers.\n2. Shift this sequence to the leftmost position.\n3. Adjust the number of leading and trailing zeros accordingly.\n\nLet's update the code to reflect this logic:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero element\n    start = 0\n    while start < len(input_grid) and input_grid[start] == 0:\n        start += 1\n    \n    # Find the last non-zero element\n    end = len(input_grid) - 1\n    while end >= 0 and input_grid[end] == 0:\n        end -= 1\n    \n    # Extract the non-zero sequence\n    non_zero_sequence = input_grid[start:end+1]\n    \n    # Calculate the number of zeros to maintain\n    total_zeros = len(input_grid) - len(non_zero_sequence)\n    \n    # Create the output grid with the non-zero sequence at the leftmost position\n    output_grid = non_zero_sequence + [0] * total_zeros\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\noutput = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nThis updated code should correctly apply the transformation rule to the test input.",
    "The updated code correctly applies the transformation rule by shifting the sequence of non-zero numbers to the leftmost position and filling the rest with zeros. The output grid is as expected based on the derived rule.\n\nThe final output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
