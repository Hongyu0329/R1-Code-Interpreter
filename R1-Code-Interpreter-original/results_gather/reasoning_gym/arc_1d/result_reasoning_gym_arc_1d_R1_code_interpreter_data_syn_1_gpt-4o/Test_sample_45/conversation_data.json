    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n**Example 1:**\n- **Input:** 4 0 8 0 0 9 0 0 0 8 4 0 0 6 9 0 0 4 4 0\n- **Output:** 4 8 9 8 4 6 9 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Example 2:**\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 4 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 9 0 9 7 0 0 0 8 3\n- **Output:** 4 8 9 9 7 8 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Example 3:**\n- **Input:** 0 1 1 0 0 5 0 0 0 8 0 0 9 8 0 0 0 0 8 1\n- **Output:** 1 1 5 8 9 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations\n1. The output grid seems to be a rearrangement of the non-zero elements from the input grid.\n2. The non-zero elements in the input are moved to the front of the output grid, maintaining their order.\n3. The remaining positions in the output grid are filled with zeros.\n\n### Rule Derivation\nThe rule can be described as follows:\n- Extract all non-zero elements from the input grid.\n- Place these non-zero elements at the beginning of the output grid in the same order they appear in the input.\n- Fill the rest of the output grid with zeros.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\nLet's apply this rule to the test input grid to predict the output.\n\n**Test Input:**\n0 8 7 0 3 4 0 3 1 0 9 0 0 0 0 9 2 7 5 4\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Extract non-zero elements: 8, 7, 3, 4, 3, 1, 9, 9, 2, 7, 5, 4\n2. Place them at the beginning of the output grid.\n3. Fill the remaining positions with zeros.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the test input grid\ninput_grid = [0, 8, 7, 0, 3, 4, 0, 3, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 2, 7, 5, 4]\n\n# Extract non-zero elements\nnon_zero_elements = [x for x in input_grid if x != 0]\n\n# Calculate the number of zeros needed\nnum_zeros = len(input_grid) - len(non_zero_elements)\n\n# Create the output grid\noutput_grid = non_zero_elements + [0] * num_zeros\n\n# Print the output grid\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the predicted output grid for the test input.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output grid based on the rule we derived. The non-zero elements from the input grid were extracted and placed at the beginning of the output grid, followed by zeros to fill the remaining positions.\n\nThe predicted output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<8 7 3 4 3 1 9 9 2 7 5 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
