    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of 1s is shifted one position to the left, and a 0 is added at the end.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of 1s is shifted one position to the left, and a 0 is added at the end.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of 1s is shifted one position to the left, and a 0 is added at the end.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- Identify the sequence of 1s in the input grid.\n- Shift this sequence one position to the left.\n- Add a 0 at the end of the grid to maintain the same length.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- **Test Input:** 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe test input grid does not contain any 1s, so the rule of shifting 1s does not directly apply. However, we can still apply the rule of shifting the sequence of non-zero numbers (in this case, 8s) to the left and adding a 0 at the end.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the output grid.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero element\n    first_non_zero_index = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), None)\n    \n    if first_non_zero_index is None:\n        # If there are no non-zero elements, return the input as is\n        return input_grid\n    \n    # Shift the sequence of non-zero elements to the left by one position\n    output_grid = input_grid[first_non_zero_index:first_non_zero_index + input_grid.count(input_grid[first_non_zero_index])]\n    output_grid = [0] * first_non_zero_index + output_grid[1:] + [0]\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the output grid for the test input.",
    "It seems there was an error in the logic of the code, particularly in handling the sequence of non-zero elements. Let's refine the approach to ensure the entire grid is processed correctly and maintains its original length.\n\n### Revised Approach\n\n1. Identify the sequence of non-zero elements.\n2. Shift this sequence one position to the left.\n3. Add a 0 at the end to maintain the grid's original length.\n\nLet's correct the code to implement this logic:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero element\n    first_non_zero_index = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), None)\n    \n    if first_non_zero_index is None:\n        # If there are no non-zero elements, return the input as is\n        return input_grid\n    \n    # Find the last non-zero element\n    last_non_zero_index = len(input_grid) - 1 - next((i for i, x in enumerate(reversed(input_grid)) if x != 0), None)\n    \n    # Extract the sequence of non-zero elements\n    non_zero_sequence = input_grid[first_non_zero_index:last_non_zero_index + 1]\n    \n    # Shift the sequence of non-zero elements to the left by one position\n    shifted_sequence = non_zero_sequence[1:] + [0]\n    \n    # Construct the output grid\n    output_grid = input_grid[:first_non_zero_index] + shifted_sequence + input_grid[last_non_zero_index + 1:]\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nThis code should correctly handle the input grid and produce the expected output. Let's execute it to verify the result.",
    "The code output is correct, and it matches the expected transformation based on the rule derived from the examples. The sequence of non-zero elements (8s) is shifted one position to the left, and a 0 is added at the end to maintain the original length of the grid.\n\nTherefore, the final output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<[8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]>>>"
