    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0\n   - **Transformation:** The sequence of 7s is shifted two positions to the right, and the leading zeros are extended.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n   - **Output:** 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n   - **Transformation:** No change is made because the sequence is already full of 7s.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0\n   - **Transformation:** The sequence of 9s is shifted three positions to the right, and the leading zeros are extended.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers.\n- Shift this sequence to the right by a number of positions equal to the number of leading zeros in the input.\n- Extend the leading zeros to fill the space created by the shift.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Leading Zeros:** 2\n- **Non-zero Sequence:** 8 8 8 8\n- **Shift the sequence of 8s two positions to the right.**\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the output grid.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero element\n    first_non_zero_index = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), None)\n    if first_non_zero_index is None:\n        return input_grid  # No non-zero elements, return as is\n\n    # Find the last non-zero element\n    last_non_zero_index = len(input_grid) - next((i for i, x in enumerate(reversed(input_grid)) if x != 0), None) - 1\n\n    # Extract the non-zero sequence\n    non_zero_sequence = input_grid[first_non_zero_index:last_non_zero_index + 1]\n\n    # Calculate the number of leading zeros\n    leading_zeros = first_non_zero_index\n\n    # Create the new output grid\n    output_grid = [0] * leading_zeros + [0] * leading_zeros + non_zero_sequence + [0] * (len(input_grid) - len(non_zero_sequence) - 2 * leading_zeros)\n\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nThe code will execute and provide the output grid based on the derived rule.",
