    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n   - **Observation:** The number '2' in the input is replaced by '8' in the output. The sequence of '8's remains unchanged.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 2 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The number '2' in the input is replaced by '9' in the output. The sequence of '9's remains unchanged.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n   - **Observation:** The number '2' in the input is replaced by '3' in the output. The sequence of '3's remains unchanged.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- Identify the number '2' in the input grid.\n- Replace the number '2' with the number that follows it in the sequence.\n- The rest of the sequence remains unchanged.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n- **Test Input:** 2 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n- **Transformation:**\n  - The number '2' is followed by '0', so we replace '2' with '4'.\n  - The sequence of '4's remains unchanged.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to transform the test input grid.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the index of '2'\n    index_of_2 = input_grid.index(2)\n    # Find the number that follows '2'\n    replacement_number = input_grid[index_of_2 + 1]\n    # Replace '2' with the replacement number\n    input_grid[index_of_2] = replacement_number\n    return input_grid\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [2, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]\n# Transform the test input\noutput_grid = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nThe code will execute and provide the transformed output grid.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output grid. Based on the rule we derived and the code execution, the transformation of the test input grid is complete.\n\nThe final output grid is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4>>>"
