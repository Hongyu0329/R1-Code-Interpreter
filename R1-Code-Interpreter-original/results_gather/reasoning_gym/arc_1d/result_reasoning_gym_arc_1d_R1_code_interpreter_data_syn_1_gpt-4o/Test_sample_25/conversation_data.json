    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The '9' is shifted one position to the right.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 7 7 1 3 9 6 7 7 2 8 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 7 7 1 3 9 6 7 7 2 8 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence starting from '5' is shifted two positions to the right.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 3 3 3 7 9 3 7 9 3 7 6 9 9 4 4 5 7 4 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 3 3 3 7 9 3 7 9 3 7 6 9 9 4 4 5 7 4\n   - **Observation:** The sequence starting from the first '3' is shifted three positions to the right.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, it seems that the rule involves shifting the non-zero sequence to the right by a number of positions equal to the number of leading zeros in the input grid. \n\n### Applying the Rule\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 1 8 8 1 7 1 6 8 9 1 8 9 1 5 0 0 0 0\n\n1. Count the leading zeros: There are 3 leading zeros.\n2. Shift the non-zero sequence (1 8 8 1 7 1 6 8 9 1 8 9 1 5) three positions to the right.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the output grid.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Count leading zeros\n    leading_zeros = 0\n    for num in input_grid:\n        if num == 0:\n            leading_zeros += 1\n        else:\n            break\n    \n    # Shift the non-zero sequence to the right by the number of leading zeros\n    non_zero_sequence = input_grid[leading_zeros:]\n    output_grid = [0] * leading_zeros + [0] * leading_zeros + non_zero_sequence[:-leading_zeros]\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 8, 1, 7, 1, 6, 8, 9, 1, 8, 9, 1, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output grid.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output grid. Let's analyze the result:\n\nThe test input grid was:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 1 8 8 1 7 1 6 8 9 1 8 9 1 5 0 0 0 0\n\nThe output grid generated by the code is:\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 8 8 1 7 1 6 8 9 1 8 9 1 5 0\n\nThis output matches the expected transformation based on the rule derived from the examples. The non-zero sequence was shifted three positions to the right, as there were three leading zeros in the input grid.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 1 8 8 1 7 1 6 8 9 1 8 9 1 5 0>>>"
