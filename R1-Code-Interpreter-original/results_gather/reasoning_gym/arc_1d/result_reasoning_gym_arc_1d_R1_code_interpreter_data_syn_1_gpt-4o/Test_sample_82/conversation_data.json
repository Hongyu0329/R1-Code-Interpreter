    "To solve this problem, we need to identify a pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze each example to find a common rule.\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 3 1 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 3 1 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence \"9 3 1 4\" is moved to the left by 3 positions.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 2 6 6 9 2 5 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 7 9 6 5 9 2 7 8 2\n   - **Output:** 9 2 5 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 7 9 6 5 9 2 7 8 2 2 6 6\n   - **Observation:** The sequence \"9 2 5 9\" is moved to the left by 3 positions.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 6 5 3 2 2 5 6 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 6 5 3 2 2 5 6 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence \"6 5 3 2 2 5 6 4\" is moved to the left by 2 positions.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, it seems that the rule involves identifying a non-zero sequence in the input grid and moving it to the left by a certain number of positions. The number of positions seems to be determined by the number of leading zeros before the sequence starts.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n- **Test Input:** 6 8 4 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 2\n- **Non-zero Sequence:** 6 8 4 9\n- **Leading Zeros:** 0 (since the sequence starts at the beginning)\n- **Move the sequence to the left by 0 positions.**\n\nThus, the output should be the same as the input since there are no leading zeros to shift the sequence.\n\nLet's confirm this by generating the output using a Python script:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero sequence\n    non_zero_sequence = []\n    for num in input_grid:\n        if num != 0:\n            non_zero_sequence.append(num)\n        elif non_zero_sequence:\n            break\n    \n    # Calculate the number of leading zeros\n    leading_zeros = input_grid.index(non_zero_sequence[0])\n    \n    # Move the sequence to the left by the number of leading zeros\n    output_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\n    output_grid[leading_zeros:leading_zeros+len(non_zero_sequence)] = non_zero_sequence\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [6, 8, 4, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 2]\noutput = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the output grid for the test input.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output grid for the test input. Based on the rule derived from the examples, the non-zero sequence \"6 8 4 9\" remains in its original position because there are no leading zeros to shift it to the left.\n\nTherefore, the final output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<6 8 4 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
