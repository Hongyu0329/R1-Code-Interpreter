    "To solve this problem, we need to identify a pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples one by one:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 6 3 9 0\n- **Output:** 3 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 6\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 1 5 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 1 5 3 0 0 0 0\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations:\n1. In each example, the non-zero elements from the input grid are shifted to a different position in the output grid.\n2. The non-zero elements seem to be moved towards the beginning of the grid, but not necessarily to the very start.\n3. The order of non-zero elements is preserved in the output grid.\n\n### Hypothesis:\nThe rule seems to involve shifting the non-zero elements to the left, but the exact position where they start is not immediately clear. It appears that the non-zero elements are moved to the leftmost position that maintains the order of the non-zero elements.\n\n### Testing the Hypothesis:\nTo confirm this hypothesis, let's write a Python script to apply this rule to the test input grid and see if it matches the expected output.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Extract non-zero elements\n    non_zero_elements = [x for x in input_grid if x != 0]\n    # Calculate the number of leading zeros in the input\n    leading_zeros = len(input_grid) - len(non_zero_elements)\n    # Create the output grid by placing non-zero elements at the start\n    output_grid = non_zero_elements + [0] * leading_zeros\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input grid\ntest_input = [6, 3, 4, 2, 6, 9, 8, 1, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n# Transform the test input grid\ntest_output = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(test_output)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the output `[6, 3, 4, 2, 6, 9, 8, 1, 7, 0, 0, 0]`. This matches the expected transformation based on the rule we derived from the examples.\n\n### Explanation of the Rule:\n- The rule involves shifting all non-zero elements to the leftmost position in the grid while maintaining their order.\n- The number of zeros at the end of the grid is equal to the number of zeros in the original input grid.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<6 3 4 2 6 9 8 1 7 0 0 0>>>"
