    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n\n### Observations:\n1. The output grid seems to be a shifted version of the input grid.\n2. The non-zero elements in the input grid are shifted to the right in the output grid.\n3. The number of positions shifted appears to be 7 positions to the right.\n\n### Hypothesis:\nThe rule is to shift all non-zero elements in the input grid 7 positions to the right in the output grid.\n\n### Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0\n\n### Applying the Rule:\nWe will apply the rule to shift the non-zero elements 7 positions to the right.\n\nLet's write a Python script to apply this rule to the test input grid.\n\n```python\ndef shift_grid(input_grid, shift_by):\n    output_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\n    for i, value in enumerate(input_grid):\n        if value != 0:\n            new_position = (i + shift_by) % len(input_grid)\n            output_grid[new_position] = value\n    return output_grid\n\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]\nshift_by = 7\noutput_grid = shift_grid(input_grid, shift_by)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nThis code will shift the non-zero elements of the test input grid by 7 positions to the right and print the resulting output grid.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output grid is as expected based on the rule we derived. The non-zero elements in the input grid have been shifted 7 positions to the right.\n\nTherefore, the predicted output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
