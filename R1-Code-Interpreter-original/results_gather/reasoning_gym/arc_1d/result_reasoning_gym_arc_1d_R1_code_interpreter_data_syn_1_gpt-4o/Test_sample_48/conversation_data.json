    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Analysis of Examples\n\n#### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 1 1 1 0 2 0 0 0 1 1 0 2 2 0 2\n- **Output:** 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1\n\n#### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 2 0 0 1 2 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 2 0 0 0 0 1 2\n- **Output:** 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n#### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 2 1 0 0 0 2 1 2 1 0 0 1 0 2 0\n- **Output:** 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1\n\n### Observations\n1. The first six elements of the output are always `2`.\n2. The next nine elements are always `0`.\n3. The last seven elements are always `1`.\n\n### Rule Derivation\nFrom the observations, we can derive the following rule for transforming the input grid to the output grid:\n- The first six elements of the output grid are `2`.\n- The next nine elements of the output grid are `0`.\n- The last seven elements of the output grid are `1`.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid.\n\n#### Test Input:\n0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 2 1 2 2 0 0\n\nAccording to the derived rule, the output grid should be:\n- First six elements: `2 2 2 2 2 2`\n- Next nine elements: `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`\n- Last seven elements: `1 1 1 1 1 1 1`\n\nThus, the output grid for the test input is:\n2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n<<<2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1>>>"
