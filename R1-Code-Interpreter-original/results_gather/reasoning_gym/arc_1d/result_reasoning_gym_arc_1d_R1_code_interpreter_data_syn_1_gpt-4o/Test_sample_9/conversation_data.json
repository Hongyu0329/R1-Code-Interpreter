    "To solve this problem, we need to identify a pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples to find a common rule.\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 7 0 0 7 0 0 7 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of 7s is preserved, but the trailing 7s after the first 0 are turned into 0s.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of 1s is preserved, but the initial 1 is turned into 0.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of 1s is preserved, but the trailing 1 is turned into 0.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, it seems the rule is:\n- Preserve the sequence of non-zero numbers until the first 0 is encountered.\n- After the first 0, turn all subsequent non-zero numbers into 0s.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n- **Input:** 0 5 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0\n- **Process:**\n  - The first 0 is followed by a 5, which is preserved.\n  - The next 0 is followed by a 5, which is turned into 0.\n  - All subsequent non-zero numbers after the first 0 are turned into 0s.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to verify the output.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    output_grid = input_grid.copy()\n    first_zero_found = False\n    for i in range(len(input_grid)):\n        if input_grid[i] == 0:\n            first_zero_found = True\n        elif first_zero_found:\n            output_grid[i] = 0\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nThe code will execute and provide the output grid based on the derived rule.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the output grid. Based on the rule we derived and the code execution, the output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
