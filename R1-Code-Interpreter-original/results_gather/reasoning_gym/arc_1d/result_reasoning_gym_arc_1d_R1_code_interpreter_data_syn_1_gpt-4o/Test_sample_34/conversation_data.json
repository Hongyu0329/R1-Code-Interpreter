    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Analysis of Examples\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0\n\n   Observations:\n   - The sequence of 8s in the input is shifted two positions to the left in the output.\n   - The number of 8s remains the same, but the leading and trailing zeros are adjusted accordingly.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n   Observations:\n   - The sequence of 9s is shifted three positions to the left.\n   - The number of 9s remains the same, and the zeros are adjusted.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n   Observations:\n   - The sequence of 8s is shifted two positions to the left.\n   - The number of 8s remains the same, and the zeros are adjusted.\n\n### Deriving the Rule\n\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers in the input.\n- Shift this sequence to the left by a number of positions equal to the number of leading zeros in the input minus the number of leading zeros in the output.\n- The number of non-zero elements remains the same, and the zeros are adjusted accordingly.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\n**Test Input:**\n0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n- The sequence of 9s starts at the 6th position.\n- The sequence of 9s should be shifted to the left by 6 positions (since there are 6 leading zeros in the input).\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the output for the test input.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero element\n    first_non_zero_index = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), None)\n    if first_non_zero_index is None:\n        return input_grid  # No non-zero elements, return as is\n\n    # Find the last non-zero element\n    last_non_zero_index = len(input_grid) - next((i for i, x in enumerate(reversed(input_grid)) if x != 0), None) - 1\n\n    # Extract the non-zero sequence\n    non_zero_sequence = input_grid[first_non_zero_index:last_non_zero_index + 1]\n\n    # Calculate the number of leading zeros in the output\n    leading_zeros_output = first_non_zero_index - (len(input_grid) - len(non_zero_sequence))\n\n    # Construct the output grid\n    output_grid = [0] * leading_zeros_output + non_zero_sequence + [0] * (len(input_grid) - len(non_zero_sequence) - leading_zeros_output)\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nThe code will be executed to determine the output for the test input.",
    "It seems there was an error in the logic for calculating the number of leading zeros in the output. Let's correct the approach to ensure the sequence of non-zero numbers is shifted correctly.\n\n### Corrected Approach\n\n1. Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers in the input.\n2. Determine the number of leading zeros in the input.\n3. Shift the sequence of non-zero numbers to the left by the number of leading zeros in the input.\n4. Fill the remaining positions with zeros.\n\nLet's correct the code to implement this logic:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero element\n    first_non_zero_index = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), None)\n    if first_non_zero_index is None:\n        return input_grid  # No non-zero elements, return as is\n\n    # Find the last non-zero element\n    last_non_zero_index = len(input_grid) - next((i for i, x in enumerate(reversed(input_grid)) if x != 0), None) - 1\n\n    # Extract the non-zero sequence\n    non_zero_sequence = input_grid[first_non_zero_index:last_non_zero_index + 1]\n\n    # Calculate the number of leading zeros in the input\n    leading_zeros_input = first_non_zero_index\n\n    # Construct the output grid\n    output_grid = [0] * leading_zeros_input + non_zero_sequence + [0] * (len(input_grid) - len(non_zero_sequence) - leading_zeros_input)\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nThis code should correctly apply the transformation rule to the test input. Let's execute it to get the correct output.",
    "The output is the same as the input, which indicates that the transformation rule was not applied correctly. Let's revisit the rule and correct the implementation.\n\n### Correct Rule Application\n\nFrom the examples, the rule seems to involve shifting the sequence of non-zero numbers to the left by a specific number of positions. The number of positions to shift appears to be related to the number of leading zeros in the input.\n\nLet's try a different approach to ensure the sequence is shifted correctly:\n\n1. Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers in the input.\n2. Determine the number of leading zeros in the input.\n3. Shift the sequence of non-zero numbers to the left by a fixed number of positions (e.g., 2 positions as seen in the examples).\n4. Fill the remaining positions with zeros.\n\nLet's implement this logic:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero element\n    first_non_zero_index = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), None)\n    if first_non_zero_index is None:\n        return input_grid  # No non-zero elements, return as is\n\n    # Find the last non-zero element\n    last_non_zero_index = len(input_grid) - next((i for i, x in enumerate(reversed(input_grid)) if x != 0), None) - 1\n\n    # Extract the non-zero sequence\n    non_zero_sequence = input_grid[first_non_zero_index:last_non_zero_index + 1]\n\n    # Calculate the number of positions to shift\n    shift_positions = 2  # Based on the examples\n\n    # Construct the output grid\n    output_grid = [0] * shift_positions + non_zero_sequence + [0] * (len(input_grid) - len(non_zero_sequence) - shift_positions)\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nThis code should correctly apply the transformation rule to the test input. Let's execute it to get the correct output.",
    "The output `[0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` matches the expected transformation based on the rule derived from the examples. The sequence of 9s has been shifted two positions to the left, which aligns with the pattern observed in the examples.\n\nTherefore, the final answer for the test input is:\n\n<<<0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
