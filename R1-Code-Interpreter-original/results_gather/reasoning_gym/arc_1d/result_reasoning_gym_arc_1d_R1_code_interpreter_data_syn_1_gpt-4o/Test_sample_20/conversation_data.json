    "To solve this problem, we need to identify a pattern or rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples to find a consistent transformation rule.\n\n### Analysis of Examples\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 1 0 2 0 0 1 2 1\n   - **Output:** 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 1 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 1 2 2 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0\n   - **Output:** 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1\n\n### Observations\n\n- The first two elements of the output are always `2 2`.\n- The rest of the output seems to be a rearrangement of the input elements.\n- The number of `1`s in the output matches the number of `1`s in the input.\n- The number of `2`s in the output matches the number of `2`s in the input.\n- The `0`s in the output fill the remaining positions.\n\n### Hypothesis\n\nThe rule seems to be:\n1. Start the output with two `2`s.\n2. Fill the rest of the output with `0`s, `1`s, and `2`s in the order of their appearance in the input, ensuring the count of each number matches the input.\n\n### Testing the Hypothesis\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- **Test Input:** 0 1 2 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 2\n\nFollowing the rule:\n1. Start with `2 2`.\n2. Count the occurrences of `1`s and `2`s in the input:\n   - `1` appears 3 times.\n   - `2` appears 2 times.\n3. Fill the rest of the output with `0`s, `1`s, and `2`s, ensuring the count matches the input.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this process and verify our hypothesis.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Start with two 2s\n    output_grid = [2, 2]\n    \n    # Count occurrences of 1s and 2s\n    count_1 = input_grid.count(1)\n    count_2 = input_grid.count(2)\n    \n    # Add 0s, 1s, and 2s to the output grid\n    output_grid.extend([0] * (len(input_grid) - 2 - count_1 - count_2))\n    output_grid.extend([1] * count_1)\n    output_grid.extend([2] * (count_2 - 2))  # Subtract 2 because we already added two 2s at the start\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2]\ntest_output = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(test_output)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matches the expected transformation based on the rule we derived. The output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<2 2 0 0 0 1 1 1 1>>>"
