    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples to find a pattern:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 9 4 0 0 0 0 0 5 3 0 9 0 9 1 0 0 3\n   - **Output:** 9 4 0 0 0 0 5 3 0 9 0 9 1 0 0 3 0\n   - **Observation:** The output is the same as the input, but with an additional '0' appended at the end.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 7 3 1 7 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8\n   - **Output:** 0 0 7 3 1 7 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0\n   - **Observation:** The output is the same as the input, but with an additional '0' appended at the end.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 8 4 7 5 8 0 4 0 0 0 2 4 6 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 8 4 7 5 8 0 4 0 0 0 2 4 6 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The output is the same as the input, but with an additional '0' appended at the end.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can deduce that the transformation rule is to append a '0' to the end of the input grid to form the output grid. This rule is consistent across all examples.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- **Test Input:** 0 3 7 9 4 0 5 0 0 0 0 2 0 3 2 3 0\n\nAccording to the rule, we append a '0' to the end of this input grid to get the output grid.\n\nLet's write a simple Python script to apply this rule:\n\n```python\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = [0, 3, 7, 9, 4, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 3, 2, 3, 0]\n\n# Apply the rule: append a '0' to the end\noutput_grid = input_grid + [0]\n\n# Print the output grid\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the output grid for the test input.\n\n<<<0 3 7 9 4 0 5 0 0 0 0 2 0 3 2 3 0 0>>>",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matches the expected transformation based on the rule we derived. The rule is to append a '0' to the end of the input grid to form the output grid. \n\nTherefore, the output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<0 3 7 9 4 0 5 0 0 0 0 2 0 3 2 3 0 0>>>"
