    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: 1 1 5 3 1 0 3 5 9 8 7 8\n   - Output: 1 5 3 1 0 3 5 9 8 7 8 1\n   - Observation: The first element (1) is moved to the end of the list.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: 9 3 6 4 1 2 5 6 1 6 2 2\n   - Output: 3 6 4 1 2 5 6 1 6 2 2 9\n   - Observation: The first element (9) is moved to the end of the list.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: 8 2 1 7 3 6 2 2 5 5 2 5\n   - Output: 2 1 7 3 6 2 2 5 5 2 5 8\n   - Observation: The first element (8) is moved to the end of the list.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can deduce a consistent rule: **The first element of the input grid is moved to the end of the output grid.** This rule is applied consistently across all examples.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- **Test Input:**\n  - 7 9 6 4 0 0 0 8 7 1 3 5\n\nAccording to the rule, we should move the first element (7) to the end of the list. Let's implement this in Python to verify:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Move the first element to the end of the list\n    return input_grid[1:] + [input_grid[0]]\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [7, 9, 6, 4, 0, 0, 0, 8, 7, 1, 3, 5]\n# Transform the test input\noutput_grid = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the transformed output grid.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the output grid `[9, 6, 4, 0, 0, 0, 8, 7, 1, 3, 5, 7]`. This matches the expected transformation based on the rule we derived: moving the first element of the input grid to the end of the output grid.\n\nTherefore, the output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<9 6 4 0 0 0 8 7 1 3 5 7>>>"
