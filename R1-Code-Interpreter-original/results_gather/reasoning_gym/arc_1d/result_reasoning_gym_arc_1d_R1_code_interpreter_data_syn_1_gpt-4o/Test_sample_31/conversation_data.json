    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples to deduce the rule.\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The number '4' is moved to the position where the first '5' was located, and the rest of the sequence is shifted to the right.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 7 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 2 2 2 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The number '7' is moved to the position where the first '2' was located, and the rest of the sequence is shifted to the right.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 8 0 0\n   - **Output:** 8 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The number '8' is moved to the position where the first '5' was located, and the rest of the sequence is shifted to the right.\n\n### Rule Deduction\n\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- Identify the first non-zero number that is different from the majority of the sequence.\n- Move this number to the position of the first occurrence of the majority number.\n- Shift the rest of the sequence to the right.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\n**Test Input:**\n4 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n- The majority number is '3'.\n- The first non-majority number is '4'.\n- Move '4' to the position of the first '3'.\n- Shift the rest of the sequence to the right.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the output for the test input.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the majority number\n    majority_number = max(set(input_grid), key=input_grid.count)\n    \n    # Find the first non-majority number\n    for num in input_grid:\n        if num != majority_number and num != 0:\n            non_majority_number = num\n            break\n    \n    # Find the position of the first majority number\n    first_majority_index = input_grid.index(majority_number)\n    \n    # Create the output grid\n    output_grid = input_grid[:]\n    output_grid[first_majority_index] = non_majority_number\n    \n    # Shift the rest of the sequence to the right\n    for i in range(first_majority_index + 1, len(input_grid)):\n        if input_grid[i] == non_majority_number:\n            output_grid[i] = majority_number\n        else:\n            output_grid[i] = input_grid[i - 1]\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output for the test input.",
