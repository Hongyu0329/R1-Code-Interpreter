    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples one by one:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations:\n1. The input grid always starts and ends with a series of zeros.\n2. The non-zero numbers in the input grid are shifted towards the beginning of the output grid.\n3. The number of zeros at the start of the output grid is reduced compared to the input grid.\n4. The number of zeros at the end of the output grid is increased compared to the input grid.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n- Identify the first non-zero number in the input grid.\n- Shift all non-zero numbers to the left, starting from the position where the first non-zero number appears in the input grid.\n- The number of zeros at the start of the output grid is equal to the number of zeros before the first non-zero number in the input grid minus 3.\n- The number of zeros at the end of the output grid is increased to fill the remaining positions.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- The first non-zero number is 7, starting at position 5.\n- Shift all 7s to the left, starting from position 2 (5 - 3 = 2).\n- Fill the remaining positions with zeros.\n\nLet's apply this rule to generate the output for the test input:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero index\n    first_non_zero_index = next(i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0)\n    \n    # Calculate the number of leading zeros in the output\n    leading_zeros = first_non_zero_index - 3\n    \n    # Extract the non-zero segment\n    non_zero_segment = input_grid[first_non_zero_index:]\n    \n    # Calculate the number of trailing zeros in the output\n    trailing_zeros = len(input_grid) - leading_zeros - len(non_zero_segment)\n    \n    # Construct the output grid\n    output_grid = [0] * leading_zeros + non_zero_segment + [0] * trailing_zeros\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n# Transform the grid\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the output grid for the test input.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the transformation rule applied was incorrect, as the output grid does not match the expected pattern observed in the examples. Let's revisit the examples and refine our understanding of the transformation rule.\n\n### Observations Revisited:\n1. The input grid has a series of zeros at the start and end.\n2. The non-zero numbers are shifted towards the beginning of the output grid.\n3. The number of zeros at the start of the output grid is reduced compared to the input grid.\n4. The number of zeros at the end of the output grid is increased compared to the input grid.\n\n### Rule Derivation Revisited:\n- Identify the first non-zero number in the input grid.\n- Shift all non-zero numbers to the left, starting from the position where the first non-zero number appears in the input grid.\n- The number of zeros at the start of the output grid is equal to the number of zeros before the first non-zero number in the input grid minus 3.\n- The number of zeros at the end of the output grid is increased to fill the remaining positions.\n\n### Correcting the Rule:\nUpon reviewing the examples, it seems the rule should be:\n- The first non-zero number in the input grid should be shifted to the position where the first non-zero number appears in the output grid.\n- The number of zeros at the start of the output grid should be reduced by 3 compared to the input grid.\n- The number of zeros at the end of the output grid should be increased to fill the remaining positions.\n\nLet's apply this corrected rule to generate the output for the test input:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero index\n    first_non_zero_index = next(i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0)\n    \n    # Calculate the number of leading zeros in the output\n    leading_zeros = first_non_zero_index - 3\n    \n    # Extract the non-zero segment\n    non_zero_segment = input_grid[first_non_zero_index:]\n    \n    # Calculate the number of trailing zeros in the output\n    trailing_zeros = len(input_grid) - leading_zeros - len(non_zero_segment)\n    \n    # Construct the output grid\n    output_grid = [0] * leading_zeros + non_zero_segment + [0] * trailing_zeros\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n# Transform the grid\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the output grid for the test input.
