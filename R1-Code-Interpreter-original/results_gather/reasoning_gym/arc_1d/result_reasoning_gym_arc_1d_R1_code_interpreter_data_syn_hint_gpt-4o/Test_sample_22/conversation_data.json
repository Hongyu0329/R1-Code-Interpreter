    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n- **Output:** 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n- **Output:** 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n- **Output:** 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n\n### Observations:\n1. The input and output grids are both 24 elements long.\n2. The transformation seems to involve shifting some elements from the beginning of the grid to the middle.\n3. The first few elements of the input grid are shifted to the middle of the output grid, and the rest of the grid remains unchanged.\n4. The number of elements shifted seems to be equal to the number of non-zero elements at the start of the input grid.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n- Identify the number of consecutive non-zero elements at the start of the input grid.\n- Shift these elements to the middle of the grid, starting from the 5th position (index 4 in zero-based indexing).\n- The rest of the grid remains unchanged.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4\n- The first six elements are non-zero (4s).\n- Shift these six 4s to start from the 5th position in the output grid.\n\nLet's apply this rule to generate the output for the test input.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the number of leading non-zero elements\n    non_zero_count = 0\n    for num in input_grid:\n        if num != 0:\n            non_zero_count += 1\n        else:\n            break\n    \n    # Create the output grid\n    output_grid = [0] * 24\n    \n    # Shift the non-zero elements to the middle\n    output_grid[0:non_zero_count] = input_grid[0:non_zero_count]\n    output_grid[4:4+non_zero_count] = input_grid[0:non_zero_count]\n    \n    # Fill the rest of the grid\n    output_grid[4+non_zero_count:] = input_grid[non_zero_count:]\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]\noutput = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the output grid for the test input.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the output grid is incorrect. The output grid should be 24 elements long, but the result has more elements, which suggests an error in the logic or implementation of the transformation rule.\n\nLet's revisit the problem and refine our approach:\n\n### Observations:\n1. The input grid is 24 elements long.\n2. The transformation involves shifting a certain number of non-zero elements from the start of the input grid to a specific position in the output grid.\n3. The number of elements shifted is equal to the number of consecutive non-zero elements at the start of the input grid.\n4. The shifted elements start from the 5th position (index 4) in the output grid.\n\n### Corrected Rule:\n- Identify the number of consecutive non-zero elements at the start of the input grid.\n- Shift these elements to start from the 5th position in the output grid.\n- The rest of the grid remains unchanged.\n\nLet's correct the code to implement this rule accurately.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the number of leading non-zero elements\n    non_zero_count = 0\n    for num in input_grid:\n        if num != 0:\n            non_zero_count += 1\n        else:\n            break\n    \n    # Create the output grid\n    output_grid = [0] * 24\n    \n    # Shift the non-zero elements to the middle\n    output_grid[4:4+non_zero_count] = input_grid[0:non_zero_count]\n    \n    # Fill the rest of the grid\n    output_grid[4+non_zero_count:] = input_grid[non_zero_count:]\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4]\noutput = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nThis corrected code should provide the correct output grid for the test input. Let's execute it to verify the result.",

    "The previous attempts to solve the problem using code have not been successful, as the output grid is not matching the expected format.
