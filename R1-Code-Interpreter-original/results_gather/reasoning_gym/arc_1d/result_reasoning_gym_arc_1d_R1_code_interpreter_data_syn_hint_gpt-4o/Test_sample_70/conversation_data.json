    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid.

The input and output grids are of the same length.\n2. The transformation involves shifting a sequence of numbers to the right.\n3. The sequence of numbers that are shifted seems to be the longest contiguous sequence of non-zero numbers in the input.\n4.
