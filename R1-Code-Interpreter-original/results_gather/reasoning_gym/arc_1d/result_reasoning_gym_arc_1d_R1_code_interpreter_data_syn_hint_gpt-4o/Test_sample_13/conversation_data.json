    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Analysis of Examples\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2 2 1 0 2 2 1 2 2 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 1 2 2 2 2 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 2 1 2\n   - **Output:** 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 2 1 0 0 1 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 1\n   - **Output:** 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n### Observations\n\n- The output grid always starts with a sequence of 2s.\n- The number of 2s at the beginning of the output seems to be equal to the number of 2s in the input grid.\n- After the initial sequence of 2s, there is a sequence of 0s.\n- The number of 0s in the output seems to be equal to the number of 0s in the input grid.\n- Finally, the output ends with a sequence of 1s.\n- The number of 1s at the end of the output seems to be equal to the number of 1s in the input grid.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the observations, we can derive the following rule:\n1. Count the number of 2s, 0s, and 1s in the input grid.\n2. Construct the output grid by placing all 2s first, followed by all 0s, and then all 1s.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- **Test Input:** 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 2 0 0 0 0\n\n1. Count the numbers:\n   - Number of 2s: 3\n   - Number of 0s: 14\n   - Number of 1s: 2\n\n2. Construct the output:\n   - Start with 3 twos: 2 2 2\n   - Follow with 14 zeros: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - End with 2 ones: 1 1\n\nThus, the output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<answer>>>\n2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1\n"
