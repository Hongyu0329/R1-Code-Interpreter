    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Analysis of Examples\n\n#### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 1 0 1 1 2 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 2 0 1 0 2 2 0\n- **Output:** 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2\n\n#### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 2\n- **Output:** 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2\n\n#### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 1 0 2 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 2 0 1 1 1 2 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2\n\n### Observations:\n1. The output grid always starts with a sequence of 1s, followed by a sequence of 0s, and ends with a sequence of 2s.\n2. The number of 1s in the output seems to be the count of 1s in the input.\n3. The number of 2s in the output seems to be the count of 2s in the input.\n4. The number of 0s in the output is the remaining length of the grid after accounting for the 1s and 2s.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\n- Count the number of 1s in the input grid.\n- Count the number of 2s in the input grid.\n- The output grid will have:\n  - A sequence of 1s equal to the count of 1s in the input.\n  - A sequence of 0s filling the remaining positions after placing 1s and 2s.\n  - A sequence of 2s equal to the count of 2s in the input.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 1 0 0 1 2 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 0 2 0 0 2 0\n- Count of 1s: 4\n- Count of 2s: 3\n- Total length of the grid: 19\n\nThe output grid will be:\n- 4 ones: 1 1 1 1\n- 12 zeros: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- 3 twos: 2 2 2\n\nCombining these, the output grid is: 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2\n\n<<<answer>>>\n1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2\n"
