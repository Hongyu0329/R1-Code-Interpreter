    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples to deduce the rule.\n\n### Observations:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 4 0 4 0 6 3 0 0 7 2 4 2 0 0 0 4 9 1 0 7 0 0 7 2\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 5 0 5 0 5 5 0 0 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 5 5\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: 5 3 4 0 2 2 0 0 8 9 0 1 0 0 0 0 7 9 5 0 3 0 0 2 7 0 0 6\n   - Output: 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 0 5 5 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 5 5 0 0 5\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: 3 9 8 9 0 1 0 5 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 3 4 0 9 5 0 3 6 8 5 0\n   - Output: 5 5 5 5 0 5 0 5 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 0\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- The output grid seems to replace most numbers with 5, except for zeros which remain unchanged.\n- In each example, any non-zero number in the input grid is replaced by 5 in the output grid.\n- Zeros in the input grid remain zeros in the output grid.\n\n### Rule Deduction:\n\nFrom the observations, the rule can be deduced as follows:\n- If the number in the input grid is zero, it remains zero in the output grid.\n- If the number in the input grid is non-zero, it is replaced by 5 in the output grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule:\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- **Test Input:**\n  - 0 2 9 6 0 4 7 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 4 2 0 2 0 7 9 0 6 6 4 0 9 0\n\nUsing the deduced rule, we transform each element:\n\n- 0 becomes 0\n- 2 becomes 5\n- 9 becomes 5\n- 6 becomes 5\n- 0 remains 0\n- 4 becomes 5\n- 7 becomes 5\n- 0 remains 0\n- 0 remains 0\n- 8 becomes 5\n- 8 becomes 5\n- 0 remains 0\n- 0 remains 0\n- 0 remains 0\n- 4 becomes 5\n- 2 becomes 5\n- 0 remains 0\n- 2 becomes 5\n- 0 remains 0\n- 7 becomes 5\n- 9 becomes 5\n- 0 remains 0\n- 6 becomes 5\n- 6 becomes 5\n- 4 becomes 5\n- 0 remains 0\n- 9 becomes 5\n- 0 remains 0\n\nThus, the output grid is:\n\n0 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 5 5 0 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 5 0 5 0\n\n<<<answer>>>0 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 5 5 0 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 5 0 5 0<<<answer>>>"
