    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Analysis of Examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:**  0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 8 8 2 2 0 0 8 8 2 2 0 0 0\n\n   Observations:\n   - The sequence of '2's at the start of the input (positions 2 to 5) is transformed to '8 8 2 2'.\n   - The sequence of '2's in the middle (positions 8 to 11) is transformed to '8 8 2 2'.\n   - The transformation seems to involve changing the first two '2's in a sequence to '8's.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:**  0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 8 2 0 0 0 0 8 8 2 2 2 0 0\n\n   Observations:\n   - The first sequence of '2's (positions 2 to 3) is transformed to '8 2'.\n   - The second sequence of '2's (positions 8 to 12) is transformed to '8 8 2 2 2'.\n   - Again, the first two '2's in a sequence are changed to '8's.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:**  2 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 8 8 2 2 2 0 8 8 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n\n   Observations:\n   - The first sequence of '2's (positions 0 to 4) is transformed to '8 8 2 2 2'.\n   - The second sequence of '2's (positions 6 to 9) is transformed to '8 8 2 2'.\n   - Consistently, the first two '2's in a sequence are changed to '8's.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n\nFrom the examples, we can derive the following rule:\n- For each contiguous sequence of '2's in the input grid, change the first two '2's to '8's in the output grid. If the sequence has fewer than two '2's, change as many as possible.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 2 2 2\n\n1. Identify sequences of '2's:\n   - First sequence: positions 2 to 8 (seven '2's)\n   - Second sequence: positions 12 to 14 (three '2's)\n\n2. Apply the rule:\n   - First sequence: Change the first two '2's to '8's, resulting in '8 8 2 2 2 2 2'.\n   - Second sequence: Change the first two '2's to '8's, resulting in '8 8 2'.\n\n3. Construct the output grid:\n   - **Output:** 0 0 8 8 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 8 8 2\n\nThus, the predicted output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<answer>>>\n0 0 8 8 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 8 8 2\n"
