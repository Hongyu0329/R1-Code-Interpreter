    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 7 0 0 7 0 0 7 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of 7s in the input is preserved in the output, but the trailing 7s after the first 0 are removed.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of 1s is preserved, but the initial 1 is replaced with 0s until the first 1 in the sequence.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of 1s is preserved, but the trailing 1s after the first 0 are removed.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, it seems the rule is:\n- Identify the first non-zero sequence in the input.\n- Preserve this sequence in the output.\n- Replace all elements after the first zero following this sequence with zeros.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\n**Test Input:**\n0 5 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0\n\n- The first non-zero sequence is `5`.\n- Preserve this sequence.\n- Replace all elements after the first zero following this sequence with zeros.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input using a Python script to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    output_grid = input_grid.copy()\n    first_non_zero_found = False\n    for i in range(len(input_grid)):\n        if input_grid[i] != 0 and not first_non_zero_found:\n            first_non_zero_found = True\n        elif first_non_zero_found and input_grid[i] == 0:\n            output_grid[i:] = [0] * (len(input_grid) - i)\n            break\n    return output_grid\n\ntest_input = [0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the output grid for the test input based on the derived rule.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the transformation rule applied was incorrect. The output does not match the expected pattern based on the examples provided. Let's revisit the rule derivation and correct the approach.\n\n### Revised Rule Derivation\n\nUpon closer inspection of the examples, the rule seems to be:\n1. Identify the first sequence of non-zero numbers.\n2. Preserve this sequence in the output.\n3. Replace all elements after the first zero following this sequence with zeros.\n\n### Correcting the Approach\n\nThe previous code did not correctly handle the preservation of the first sequence of non-zero numbers. Let's refine the code to ensure it accurately implements the rule.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    output_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\n    first_non_zero_found = False\n    for i in range(len(input_grid)):\n        if input_grid[i] != 0 and not first_non_zero_found:\n            first_non_zero_found = True\n            output_grid[i] = input_grid[i]\n        elif first_non_zero_found:\n            if input_grid[i] != 0:\n                output_grid[i] = input_grid[i]\n            else:\n                break\n    return output_grid\n\ntest_input = [0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nThis revised code should correctly apply the rule to the test input, preserving the first sequence of non-zero numbers and replacing subsequent elements with zeros.
