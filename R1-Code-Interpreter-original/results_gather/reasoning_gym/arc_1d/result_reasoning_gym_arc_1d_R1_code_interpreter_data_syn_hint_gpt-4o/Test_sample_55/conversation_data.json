    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 0\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0\n- **Output:** 6 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations:\n1. In Example 1, the sequence of '6's is shifted to the right by 4 positions.\n2. In Example 2, the sequence of '6's is shifted to the left by 3 positions.\n3. In Example 3, the single '7' is shifted to the right by 4 positions.\n\n### Hypothesis:\nThe rule seems to involve shifting the sequence of non-zero numbers within the grid. The direction and magnitude of the shift depend on the position of the first non-zero number in the input grid.\n\n### Test Input:\n- **Input:** 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9\n\n### Applying the Rule:\n1. Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers: '9 9' at the start and a single '9' at the end.\n2. Shift the sequence to the right by 4 positions, similar to the pattern observed in Example 1 and Example 3.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input to predict the output grid.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Identify the non-zero sequence\n    non_zero_sequence = [x for x in input_grid if x != 0]\n    \n    # Determine the shift amount (4 positions to the right)\n    shift_amount = 4\n    \n    # Create the output grid with zeros\n    output_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\n    \n    # Place the non-zero sequence in the new position\n    for i, value in enumerate(non_zero_sequence):\n        output_grid[i + shift_amount] = value\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nExecuting the code will give us the predicted output grid.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the transformation applied was incorrect. The output grid does not match the expected pattern based on the examples provided. Let's revisit the problem and refine our approach.\n\n### Observations:\n1. In Example 1, the sequence of '6's is shifted to the right by 4 positions.\n2. In Example 2, the sequence of '6's is shifted to the left by 3 positions.\n3. In Example 3, the single '7' is shifted to the right by 4 positions.\n\n### Hypothesis:\nThe rule involves shifting the sequence of non-zero numbers within the grid. The direction and magnitude of the shift depend on the position of the first non-zero number in the input grid.\n\n### Revised Approach:\n1. Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers.\n2. Determine the shift direction and magnitude based on the position of the first non-zero number.\n3. Apply the shift to the sequence and construct the output grid.\n\nLet's refine the code to correctly apply this rule to the test input.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Identify the non-zero sequence\n    non_zero_sequence = [x for x in input_grid if x != 0]\n    \n    # Determine the shift amount based on the position of the first non-zero number\n    first_non_zero_index = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), None)\n    \n    # If the first non-zero number is in the first half, shift right by 4\n    # If in the second half, shift left by 3\n    if first_non_zero_index < len(input_grid) // 2:\n        shift_amount = 4\n    else:\n        shift_amount = -3\n    \n    # Create the output grid with zeros\n    output_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\n    \n    # Place the non-zero sequence in the new position\n    for i, value in enumerate(non_zero_sequence):\n        new_index = i + shift_amount\n        if 0 <= new_index < len(output_grid):\n            output_grid[new_index] = value\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nExecuting this refined code will help us determine the correct output grid.",
    "The previous attempts to solve the problem using code have not yielded the correct results. Let's switch to a more detailed textual reasoning approach to identify the correct transformation rule.\n\n### Observations from Examples:\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 0\n   - The sequence of '6's is shifted to the right by 4 positions.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0\n   - Output: 6 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n   - The sequence of '6's is shifted to the left by 3 positions.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - Output: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0\n   - The single '7' is shifted to the right by 4 positions.\n\n### Analysis:\n- The transformation involves shifting the sequence of non-zero numbers.\n- The direction and magnitude of the shift seem to depend on the position of the first non-zero number.\n- If the first non-zero number is in the first half of the grid, the sequence is shifted to the right.\n- If the first non-zero number is in the second half, the sequence is shifted to the left.\n\n### Test Input:\n- **Input:** 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9\n\n### Applying the Rule:\n1. Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers: '9 9' at the start and a single '9' at the end.\n2. Since the first non-zero number is at the start (first half), shift the sequence to the right by 4 positions.\n\n### Predicted Output:\n- The sequence '9 9' should be shifted to the right by 4 positions, resulting in:\n  - 0 0 0 0 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nLet's finalize the answer based on this reasoning.\n\n<<<answer>>>\n0 0 0 0 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n<<<answer>>>"
