    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** `0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0`\n- **Output:** `0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0`\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`\n- **Output:** `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** `5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`\n- **Output:** `5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`\n\n### Observations:\n1. The input grid is a sequence of numbers, primarily consisting of a block of repeated numbers followed by zeros.\n2. The output grid seems to retain the first and last non-zero numbers from the input grid, while setting the rest to zero.\n3. The zeros at the end of the input grid remain zeros in the output grid.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n- Identify the first and last non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n- Retain these numbers in their respective positions in the output grid.\n- Set all other numbers in between to zero.\n- Retain the zeros at the end of the grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** `2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`\n- The first non-zero number is `2` at position 0.\n- The last non-zero number is `2` at position 17.\n- The output should retain `2` at positions 0 and 17, and set all other numbers in between to zero.\n\nLet's construct the output grid based on this rule:\n\n```python\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n# Initialize the output grid with zeros\noutput_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\n\n# Set the first and last non-zero elements\noutput_grid[0] = input_grid[0]\noutput_grid[17] = input_grid[17]\n\n# Print the output grid\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the predicted output grid.",
    "The code execution result matches the expected transformation based on the derived rule. The rule was to retain the first and last non-zero numbers from the input grid and set all other numbers in between to zero, while keeping the zeros at the end of the grid unchanged.\n\nThe output grid `[2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` correctly reflects this transformation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer for the test input grid is:\n\n<<<answer>>>\n2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n<<<answer>>>"
