    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The number 4 appears at positions 5 and 19 in the input. In the output, the number 4 is extended from position 5 to 19.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The number 4 appears at positions 4 and 7 in the input. In the output, the number 4 is extended from position 4 to 7.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The number 2 appears at positions 8 and 12 in the input. In the output, the number 2 is extended from position 8 to 12.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can derive the following rule:\n- Identify the non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n- For each non-zero number, find the first and last occurrence of that number.\n- In the output grid, fill the positions from the first occurrence to the last occurrence with that number.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 9\n- The number 9 appears at positions 16 and 21.\n- In the output, the number 9 should be extended from position 16 to 21.\n\nTherefore, the output grid should be:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9\n\n<<<answer>>>\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9\n"
