    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 1 0 2 0 0 1 2 1\n   - **Output:** 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 1 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 1 2 2 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0\n   - **Output:** 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1\n\n### Observations\n\n- The first two elements of the output are always `2 2`.\n- The rest of the output seems to be a rearrangement of the input elements.\n- The number of `1`s in the output matches the number of `1`s in the input.\n- The number of `0`s in the output matches the number of `0`s in the input.\n- The number of `2`s in the output matches the number of `2`s in the input.\n- The `2`s are placed at the beginning of the output, followed by `0`s, and then `1`s.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the observations, we can derive the following rule:\n1. Count the number of `2`s, `0`s, and `1`s in the input.\n2. Construct the output by placing all `2`s first, followed by all `0`s, and then all `1`s.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n- **Test Input:** 0 1 2 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 2\n\n1. Count the occurrences:\n   - `2`s: 2\n   - `0`s: 5\n   - `1`s: 4\n\n2. Construct the output:\n   - Start with two `2`s: `2 2`\n   - Add five `0`s: `2 2 0 0 0 0 0`\n   - Add four `1`s: `2 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1`\n\nThus, the output for the test input is:\n\n<<<answer>>>\n2 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1\n"
