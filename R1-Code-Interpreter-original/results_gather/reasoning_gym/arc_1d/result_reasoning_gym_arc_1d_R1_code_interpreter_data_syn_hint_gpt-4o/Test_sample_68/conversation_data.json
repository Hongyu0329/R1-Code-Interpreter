    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n- **Output:** 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0\n\n### Observations:\n1. The output grid seems to be a shifted version of the input grid.\n2. The shift involves moving the non-zero sequence to the right by a certain number of positions.\n3. The number of zeros at the beginning of the output grid increases, while the number of zeros at the end decreases.\n4. The non-zero sequence remains intact but is shifted to the right.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n- The rule appears to be shifting the non-zero sequence to the right by 5 positions.\n- The zeros at the beginning of the input grid are increased by 5, and the zeros at the end are decreased by 5.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Expected Output:** Shift the non-zero sequence (8 8 8 8) to the right by 5 positions.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero element\n    first_non_zero = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), None)\n    # Find the last non-zero element\n    last_non_zero = len(input_grid) - next((i for i, x in enumerate(reversed(input_grid)) if x != 0), None) - 1\n    \n    # Extract the non-zero sequence\n    non_zero_sequence = input_grid[first_non_zero:last_non_zero + 1]\n    \n    # Create the new output grid\n    output_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\n    \n    # Place the non-zero sequence shifted by 5 positions to the right\n    output_grid[5:5 + len(non_zero_sequence)] = non_zero_sequence\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n# Transform the test input\ntest_output = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(test_output)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output for the test input.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the transformation rule was applied correctly, as the output grid matches the expected pattern based on the derived rule. The non-zero sequence (8, 8, 8, 8) was shifted to the right by 5 positions, and the zeros were adjusted accordingly.\n\nThe final output grid for the test input is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThis matches the expected transformation based on the examples provided.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>>\n0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n<<<answer>>>"
