    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 1 1 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 1 1 0 0 0\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 5 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 8 8 8 8 0 8 8 8\n\n### Observations:\n1. In each example, there is a segment of the input grid that is transformed into a repeated pattern in the output grid.\n2. The repeated pattern in the output grid corresponds to a non-zero number in the input grid.\n3. The transformation seems to involve repeating the non-zero number in the input grid across certain positions in the output grid.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n- Identify the non-zero number in the input grid.\n- Repeat this number in the output grid at specific positions, which seem to be determined by the position of the non-zero number in the input grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 0 2 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- The non-zero numbers are 2 and 1.\n- Based on the examples, the number 2 should be repeated in the first few positions, and the number 1 should remain in its position.\n\nLet's apply this rule to generate the output for the test input.\n\n```python\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n# Initialize the output grid with zeros\noutput_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\n\n# Apply the transformation rule\n# Repeat the number 2 in the first few positions\noutput_grid[0:4] = [2, 2, 2, 2]\n\n# Keep the number 1 in its position\noutput_grid[3:5] = [1, 1]\n\n# Print the output grid\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output grid.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the transformation rule was not correctly applied, as the output does not match the expected pattern based on the examples. Let's revisit the examples and refine our understanding of the transformation rule.\n\n### Observations Revisited:\n1. In each example, the non-zero number in the input grid is repeated in the output grid.\n2. The repetition of the non-zero number seems to occur in a specific pattern, often starting from the beginning of the grid and extending to a certain length.\n3. The position of the non-zero number in the input grid influences where and how it is repeated in the output grid.\n\n### Rule Refinement:\n- Identify the first non-zero number in the input grid.\n- Repeat this number in the output grid starting from the beginning up to the position where the next non-zero number appears.\n- The next non-zero number should remain in its position in the output grid.\n\nLet's apply this refined rule to generate the output for the test input.\n\n```python\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n# Initialize the output grid with zeros\noutput_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\n\n# Find the first non-zero number and its position\nfirst_non_zero = None\nfirst_non_zero_pos = None\n\nfor i, num in enumerate(input_grid):\n    if num != 0:\n        first_non_zero = num\n        first_non_zero_pos = i\n        break\n\n# Repeat the first non-zero number up to its position\nif first_non_zero is not None:\n    output_grid[:first_non_zero_pos] = [first_non_zero] * first_non_zero_pos\n\n# Copy the rest of the input grid to the output grid\noutput_grid[first_non_zero_pos:] = input_grid[first_non_zero_pos:]\n\n# Print the output grid\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to verify the output grid.",
