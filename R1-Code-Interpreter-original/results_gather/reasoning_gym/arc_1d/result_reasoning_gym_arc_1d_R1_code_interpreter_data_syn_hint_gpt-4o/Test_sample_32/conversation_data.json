    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 3 3 3 3 3 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 0\n   - **Output:** 2 2 2 2 2 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 3 3 3 3 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0\n   - **Output:** 2 2 2 2 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 3 3 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n   - **Output:** 0 2 2 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n### Observations\n\n- The transformation seems to involve changing the '3's in the input grid to '2's and '1's in the output grid.\n- The first few '3's in the input are transformed to '2's in the output, and the remaining '3's are transformed to '1's.\n- The '0's in the input remain '0's in the output.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, it appears that:\n- The first sequence of '3's in the input is transformed to '2's in the output.\n- The remaining '3's are transformed to '1's.\n- The '0's remain unchanged.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nGiven the test input:\n- **Input:** 3 3 3 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0\n\nWe apply the rule:\n- The first three '3's are transformed to '2's.\n- The next sequence of '3's is transformed to '1's.\n- The '0's remain unchanged.\n\nThus, the output should be:\n- **Output:** 2 2 2 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\n\nLet's confirm this by generating the output using the derived rule.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    output_grid = []\n    first_sequence = True\n    for num in input_grid:\n        if num == 3:\n            if first_sequence:\n                output_grid.append(2)\n            else:\n                output_grid.append(1)\n        else:\n            output_grid.append(num)\n            first_sequence = False\n    return output_grid\n\ninput_grid = [3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm the output grid based on the derived rule.",
    "The code execution result matches the expected output based on the rule derived from the examples. The transformation rule was correctly applied to the test input grid, and the output grid was generated as expected.\n\n### Summary of the Rule:\n- The first sequence of '3's in the input grid is transformed to '2's in the output grid.\n- The remaining '3's are transformed to '1's.\n- The '0's remain unchanged.\n\n### Test Input and Output:\n- **Input:** 3 3 3 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0\n- **Output:** 2 2 2 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\n\nThe code correctly implements this rule, and the output matches the expected result. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>>\n2 2 2 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\n<<<answer>>>"
