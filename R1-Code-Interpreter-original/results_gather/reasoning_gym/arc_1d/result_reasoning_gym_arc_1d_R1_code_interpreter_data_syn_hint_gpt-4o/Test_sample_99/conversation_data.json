    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples to find a pattern or rule:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 2 8 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 2 2 5 0\n   - **Output:** 0 2 8 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 2 2 5\n\n   Observing the transformation, it seems that the first element of the input is moved to the end of the output, and all other elements are shifted one position to the left.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 3 0 0 0 0 4 2 7 5 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 9 6 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 4 2 7 5 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 9 6 0\n\n   Again, the first element (0) is moved to the end, and the rest are shifted left.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 5 0 6 4 1 4 6 1 0 0 3 0 8 2 0 0 2 0 6 8 0\n   - **Output:** 0 5 0 6 4 1 4 6 1 0 0 3 0 8 2 0 0 2 0 6 8\n\n   The first element (5) is moved to the end, and the rest are shifted left.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, the rule can be summarized as:\n- Take the first element of the input grid.\n- Move this first element to the end of the grid.\n- Shift all other elements one position to the left.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 4 0 9 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 1 0 6 0 0 0 9 0\n\nFollowing the rule:\n- The first element (0) is moved to the end.\n- All other elements are shifted one position to the left.\n\nLet's compute the output using this rule:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Move the first element to the end and shift others to the left\n    return input_grid[1:] + [input_grid[0]]\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 9, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 1, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the transformed output grid.",
    "The code execution result matches our expectations based on the derived rule. The transformation rule we identified was to move the first element of the input grid to the end and shift all other elements one position to the left. The code correctly implements this rule, and the output grid `[0, 0, 4, 0, 9, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 1, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]` is the expected result.\n\nSince the code execution result is correct and there are no errors in the logic or implementation, we can confidently provide the final answer.\n\n<<<answer>>>\n0 0 4 0 9 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 1 0 6 0 0 0 9 0 0\n"
