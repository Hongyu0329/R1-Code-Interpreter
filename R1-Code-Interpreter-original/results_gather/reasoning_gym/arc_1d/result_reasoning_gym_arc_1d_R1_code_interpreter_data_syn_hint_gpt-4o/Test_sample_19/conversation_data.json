    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 9 1 2 1 7 5 7 6 6 9 9 8 9 7 5 9 4 4 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 1 2 1 7 5 7 6 6 9 9 8 9 7 5 9 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 1 4 8 6 5 6 3 8 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 1 4 8 6 5 6 3 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 9 3 2 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 9 3 2 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations:\n1. In each example, the sequence of non-zero numbers in the input grid is shifted to the left in the output grid.\n2. The zeros at the beginning of the input grid are moved to the end of the output grid.\n3. The number of zeros moved to the end is equal to the number of leading zeros in the input grid.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n- Identify the first non-zero element in the input grid.\n- Shift all elements from this position to the end of the grid to the left.\n- Move the leading zeros to the end of the grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 8 9 2 8 8 6 3 9 8 2 6 4 7 7\n- The first non-zero element is at position 11 (1-based index).\n- Shift elements from position 11 to the end to the left.\n- Move the 11 leading zeros to the end.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to predict the output for the test input.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero element\n    first_non_zero_index = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), len(input_grid))\n    \n    # Shift non-zero elements to the left\n    non_zero_part = input_grid[first_non_zero_index:]\n    \n    # Count leading zeros\n    leading_zeros_count = first_non_zero_index\n    \n    # Append leading zeros to the end\n    output_grid = non_zero_part + [0] * leading_zeros_count\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 9, 2, 8, 8, 6, 3, 9, 8, 2, 6, 4, 7, 7]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the predicted output grid for the test input.",
    "The code execution result matches the expected transformation based on the rule we derived. The rule was to shift the sequence of non-zero numbers to the left and move the leading zeros to the end of the grid. The output grid `[1, 8, 9, 2, 8, 8, 6, 3, 9, 8, 2, 6, 4, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` correctly reflects this transformation.\n\nSince the code has successfully implemented the rule and produced the correct output, we can conclude that the solution is correct. Therefore, the final answer for the test input grid is:\n\n<<<answer>>>\n1 8 9 2 8 8 6 3 9 8 2 6 4 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n"
