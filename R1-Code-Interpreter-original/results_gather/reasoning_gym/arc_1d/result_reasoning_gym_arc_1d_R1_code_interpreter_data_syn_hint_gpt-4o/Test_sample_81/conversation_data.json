    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of 1s is shifted to the right by 5 positions.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of 6s is shifted to the right by 12 positions.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of 1s is shifted to the right by 7 positions.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can deduce that the non-zero sequence in the input grid is shifted to the right by a certain number of positions in the output grid. The number of positions seems to be related to the position of the first non-zero element in the input grid.\n\n- In Example 1, the first non-zero element (1) is at position 1, and the shift is 5 positions.\n- In Example 2, the first non-zero element (6) is at position 8, and the shift is 12 positions.\n- In Example 3, the first non-zero element (1) is at position 13, and the shift is 7 positions.\n\nThe shift seems to be calculated as the difference between the length of the grid and the position of the first non-zero element.\n\n### Applying the Rule\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- The first non-zero element (3) is at position 9.\n- The length of the grid is 30.\n- The shift is calculated as \\(30 - 9 = 21\\).\n\nLet's generate the output grid by shifting the sequence of 3s to the right by 21 positions.\n\n```python\n# Define the input grid\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n# Find the first non-zero element and its position\nfirst_non_zero_pos = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), None)\n\n# Calculate the shift\nshift = len(input_grid) - first_non_zero_pos\n\n# Create the output grid\noutput_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\nfor i in range(first_non_zero_pos, len(input_grid)):\n    if input_grid[i] != 0:\n        new_pos = i + shift\n        if new_pos < len(input_grid):\n            output_grid[new_pos] = input_grid[i]\n\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nThe code will execute and provide the output grid based on the derived rule.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the output grid is entirely zeros, which is incorrect. This suggests that the logic for determining the shift or applying it is flawed. Let's revisit the problem and refine our approach.\n\n### Re-evaluating the Rule\n\nUpon reviewing the examples, it seems the shift is not simply the difference between the length of the grid and the position of the first non-zero element. Instead, the shift appears to be a fixed number of positions to the right, which varies based on the specific example.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Shift: 5 positions to the right.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Shift: 12 positions to the right.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Shift: 7 positions to the right.\n\nThe shift seems to be a specific number of positions that is not directly derived from the position of the first non-zero element. Instead, it might be a fixed pattern or rule that needs to be identified.\n\n### New Approach\n\nLet's try a different approach by analyzing the examples to find a consistent rule for the shift. We will then apply this rule to the test input.\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - The sequence of 1s is shifted to the right by 5 positions.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - The sequence of 6s is shifted to the right by 12 positions.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - The sequence of 1s is shifted to the right by 7 positions.\n\nThe shift seems to be related to the length of the sequence of non-zero elements. Let's try to determine if the shift is proportional to the length of the sequence.\n\n### Code to Determine Shift\n\nLet's write a code snippet to determine the shift based on the length of the sequence of non-zero elements.\n\n```python\n# Define the input grid\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n# Find the first and last non-zero elements\nfirst_non_zero_pos = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), None)\nlast_non_zero_pos = len(input_grid) - 1 - next((i for i, x in enumerate(reversed(input_grid)) if x != 0), None)\n\n# Calculate the length of the non-zero sequence\nnon_zero_length = last_non_zero_pos - first_non_zero_pos + 1\n\n# Determine the shift based on the length of the non-zero sequence\n# Hypothesis: The shift is equal to the length of the non-zero sequence\nshift = non_zero_length\n\n# Create the output grid\noutput_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\nfor i in range(first_non_zero_pos, last_non_zero_pos + 1):\n    new_pos = i + shift\n    if new_pos < len(input_grid):\n        output_grid[new_pos] = input_grid[i]\n\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to apply a shift equal to the length of the non-zero sequence to the test input grid. Let's see if this approach yields the correct output.",
    "The previous approach did not yield the correct output, indicating that the hypothesis about the shift being equal to the length of the non-zero sequence was incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the problem and try a different approach.\n\n### Re-evaluating the Problem\n\nUpon closer inspection, it seems that the shift is not directly related to the length of the non-zero sequence. Instead, it might be a fixed pattern or rule that needs to be identified from the examples.\n\n### Observations from Examples\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: Sequence of 1s starts at position 1 and ends at position 24.\n   - Output: Sequence of 1s starts at position 5 and ends at position 28.\n   - Shift: 4 positions to the right.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: Sequence of 6s starts at position 8 and ends at position 23.\n   - Output: Sequence of 6s starts at position 12 and ends at position 27.\n   - Shift: 4 positions to the right.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: Sequence of 1s starts at position 13 and ends at position 21.\n   - Output: Sequence of 1s starts at position 17 and ends at position 25.\n   - Shift: 4 positions to the right.\n\n### Consistent Rule\n\nFrom the examples, it appears that the non-zero sequence is consistently shifted 4 positions to the right. Let's apply this rule to the test input.\n\n### Applying the Rule\n\nLet's write a code snippet to apply a fixed shift of 4 positions to the right for the non-zero sequence in the test input grid.\n\n```python\n# Define the input grid\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n# Find the first and last non-zero elements\nfirst_non_zero_pos = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), None)\nlast_non_zero_pos = len(input_grid) - 1 - next((i for i, x in enumerate(reversed(input_grid)) if x != 0), None)\n\n# Define the fixed shift\nshift = 4\n\n# Create the output grid\noutput_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\nfor i in range(first_non_zero_pos, last_non_zero_pos + 1):\n    new_pos = i + shift\n    if new_pos < len(input_grid):\n        output_grid[new_pos] = input_grid[i]\n\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nThis code will apply a fixed shift of 4 positions to the right for the non-zero sequence in the test input grid. Let's see if this approach yields the correct output.",
    "The previous attempts to solve the problem using a fixed shift did not yield the correct results. Let's take a step back and analyze the problem more thoroughly to identify the correct transformation rule.\n\n### Detailed Analysis\n\nLet's revisit the examples to identify a consistent pattern or rule:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of 1s is shifted to the right by 5 positions.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of 6s is shifted to the right by 12 positions.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of 1s is shifted to the right by 7 positions.\n\n### Identifying the Rule\n\nThe shift seems to be related to the position of the first non-zero element and the length of the sequence. Let's try to derive a formula or pattern from these observations.\n\n- In Example 1, the first non-zero element is at position 1, and the shift is 5.\n- In Example 2, the first non-zero element is at position 8, and the shift is 12.\n- In Example 3, the first non-zero element is at position 13, and the shift is 7.\n\nThe shift seems to be calculated as the difference between the position of the first non-zero element and a fixed position, possibly related to the length of the grid.\n\n### New Approach\n\nLet's try a new approach by calculating the shift based on the position of the first non-zero element and the length of the grid.\n\n```python\n# Define the input grid\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n# Find the first and last non-zero elements\nfirst_non_zero_pos = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), None)\nlast_non_zero_pos = len(input_grid) - 1 - next((i for i, x in enumerate(reversed(input_grid)) if x != 0), None)\n\n# Calculate the length of the non-zero sequence\nnon_zero_length = last_non_zero_pos - first_non_zero_pos + 1\n\n# Calculate the shift based on the position of the first non-zero element\n# Hypothesis: The shift is calculated as (length of grid - position of first non-zero element - non-zero length)\nshift = len(input_grid) - first_non_zero_pos - non_zero_length\n\n# Create the output grid\noutput_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\nfor i in range(first_non_zero_pos, last_non_zero_pos + 1):\n    new_pos = i + shift\n    if new_pos < len(input_grid):\n        output_grid[new_pos] = input_grid[i]\n\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to apply a shift based on the position of the first non-zero element and the length of the grid. Let's see if this approach yields the correct output.",
    "The previous attempts have not successfully identified the correct transformation rule. Let's take a more systematic approach to identify the pattern and apply it correctly.\n\n### Observations from Examples\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\n   - **Shift:** The sequence of 1s is shifted to the right by 5 positions.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0\n   - **Shift:** The sequence of 6s is shifted to the right by 12 positions.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Shift:** The sequence of 1s is shifted to the right by 7 positions.\n\n### Pattern Recognition\n\nThe shift seems to be related to the position of the first non-zero element and the length of the sequence.
