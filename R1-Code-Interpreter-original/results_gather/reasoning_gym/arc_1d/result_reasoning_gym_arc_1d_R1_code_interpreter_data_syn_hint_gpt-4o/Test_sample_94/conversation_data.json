    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 4 3 8 8 4 3 3 8 2 5 9 3 6 4 8 7 1 7 7 5 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 3 8 8 4 3 3 8 2 5 9 3 6 4 8 7 1 7 7 5 0\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 1 2 5 3 4 4 7 7 4 7 1 4 7 4 1 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 1 2 5 3 4 4 7 7 4 7 1 4 7 4 1 0\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 3 4 3 7 1 6 2 3 8 6 8 7 7 9 5 1 6 1 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 4 3 7 1 6 2 3 8 6 8 7 7 9 5 1 6 1 0\n\n### Observations:\n1. The output grid always starts with a sequence of zeros.\n2. The number of leading zeros in the output grid is greater than or equal to the number of leading zeros in the input grid.\n3. The non-zero elements in the output grid appear to be shifted to the right compared to the input grid.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n- The rule seems to be that we shift the non-zero elements to the right by a certain number of positions, filling the beginning of the grid with zeros.\n- The number of zeros at the start of the output grid is determined by the position of the first non-zero element in the input grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 8 3 3 1 9 2 5 7 5 2 9 2 8 3 2 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- The first non-zero element is at position 2 (0-indexed).\n- Therefore, the output should have zeros up to position 2, and the rest of the elements should be shifted to the right.\n\nLet's apply this rule to generate the output for the test input.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero element\n    first_non_zero_index = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), len(input_grid))\n    # Create the output grid with leading zeros\n    output_grid = [0] * first_non_zero_index + input_grid[first_non_zero_index:]\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 8, 3, 3, 1, 9, 2, 5, 7, 5, 2, 9, 2, 8, 3, 2, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nThe code will execute and provide the output grid based on the derived rule.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the transformation rule I applied was incorrect. The output grid did not match the expected pattern observed in the examples. Let's revisit the problem and refine our approach.\n\n### Re-evaluating the Rule:\nUpon closer inspection of the examples, it seems that the number of leading zeros in the output grid is not just determined by the position of the first non-zero element in the input grid. Instead, it appears that the non-zero elements are shifted further to the right, and the number of leading zeros in the output grid is greater than the number of leading zeros in the input grid.\n\n### Observations:\n1. In Example 1, the input has 3 leading zeros, and the output has 7 leading zeros.\n2. In Example 2, the input has 7 leading zeros, and the output has 10 leading zeros.\n3. In Example 3, the input has 5 leading zeros, and the output has 9 leading zeros.\n\n### Pattern:\nThe number of leading zeros in the output grid seems to be consistently 4 more than the number of leading zeros in the input grid.\n\n### Revised Rule:\n- Count the number of leading zeros in the input grid.\n- Add 4 to this count to determine the number of leading zeros in the output grid.\n- Shift the non-zero elements to the right accordingly.\n\nLet's implement this revised rule in the code.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Count the number of leading zeros in the input grid\n    leading_zeros = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), len(input_grid))\n    # Calculate the number of leading zeros in the output grid\n    output_leading_zeros = leading_zeros + 4\n    # Create the output grid with the calculated number of leading zeros\n    output_grid = [0] * output_leading_zeros + input_grid[leading_zeros:]\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 8, 3, 3, 1, 9, 2, 5, 7, 5, 2, 9, 2, 8, 3, 2, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nThis code should correctly apply the transformation rule to the test input grid.",
    "The code execution result shows that the output grid has more zeros than expected, indicating that the rule I applied was incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the examples and refine our approach.\n\n### Re-evaluating the Rule:\nUpon further inspection, it seems that the number of leading zeros in the output grid is not simply a fixed number more than the input grid. Instead, the transformation involves shifting the non-zero elements to the right by a specific number of positions, which is not constant across examples.\n\n### Observations:\n1. In Example 1, the input has 3 leading zeros, and the output has 7 leading zeros.\n2. In Example 2, the input has 7 leading zeros, and the output has 10 leading zeros.\n3. In Example 3, the input has 5 leading zeros, and the output has 9 leading zeros.\n\n### Pattern:\nThe number of leading zeros in the output grid seems to be determined by the position of the first non-zero element in the input grid, and the non-zero elements are shifted to the right by a certain number of positions.\n\n### Revised Rule:\n- Identify the position of the first non-zero element in the input grid.\n- Shift the non-zero elements to the right by a number of positions equal to the position of the first non-zero element.\n\nLet's implement this revised rule in the code.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero element\n    first_non_zero_index = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), len(input_grid))\n    # Calculate the number of leading zeros in the output grid\n    output_leading_zeros = first_non_zero_index + 4\n    # Create the output grid with the calculated number of leading zeros\n    output_grid = [0] * output_leading_zeros + input_grid[first_non_zero_index:]\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 8, 3, 3, 1, 9, 2, 5, 7, 5, 2, 9, 2, 8, 3, 2, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nThis code should correctly apply the transformation rule to the test input grid.",
