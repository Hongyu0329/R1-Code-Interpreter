    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 6 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 3 3 3 0 3 3 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 3 0 3 3 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations\n\n- The first element of the output is always the same as the first element of the input.\n- The second element of the output is always 0.\n- The third element of the output is the same as the third element of the input.\n- The fourth element of the output is the same as the first element of the input.\n- The fifth element of the output is always 0.\n- The sixth element of the output is the same as the third element of the input.\n- The seventh element of the output is the same as the first element of the input.\n- The eighth element of the output is the same as the third element of the input.\n- The remaining elements (9th to 13th) are all 0, which remain unchanged.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nBased on the observations, the rule for transforming the input grid to the output grid can be described as follows:\n\n- Output[0] = Input[0]\n- Output[1] = 0\n- Output[2] = Input[2]\n- Output[3] = Input[0]\n- Output[4] = 0\n- Output[5] = Input[2]\n- Output[6] = Input[0]\n- Output[7] = Input[2]\n- Output[8] to Output[12] = 0\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- **Test Input:** 9 0 9 9 9 0 9 9 0 0 0 0 0\n\nUsing the derived rule, the output grid will be:\n\n- Output[0] = 9\n- Output[1] = 0\n- Output[2] = 9\n- Output[3] = 9\n- Output[4] = 0\n- Output[5] = 9\n- Output[6] = 9\n- Output[7] = 9\n- Output[8] to Output[12] = 0\n\nThus, the predicted output grid is:\n\n9 0 9 9 0 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0\n\n<<<answer>>>9 0 9 9 0 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0<<<answer>>>"
