    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 6 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5\n- **Output:** 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 5\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 2 0 5\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 2 2 5\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 5 0 0 0 0 7 3 0 0 0 0 0 8 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 5 7 7 7 7 7 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations:\n1. The non-zero numbers in the input grid are expanded in the output grid.\n2. Each non-zero number in the input grid is repeated in the output grid, starting from its position and filling the subsequent positions until the next non-zero number or the end of the grid.\n3. The zeroes in the input grid remain zeroes in the output grid unless they are between two non-zero numbers, in which case they are replaced by the preceding non-zero number.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n- For each non-zero number in the input grid, replace the zeroes following it with that number until another non-zero number is encountered or the end of the grid is reached.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n### Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 5\n\n### Applying the Rule:\n1. The first non-zero number is 9 at position 5. Replace the zeroes following it with 9 until the next non-zero number (2 at position 8).\n2. The next non-zero number is 2 at position 8. Replace the zeroes following it with 2 until the next non-zero number (2 at position 15).\n3. The next non-zero number is 2 at position 15. Replace the zeroes following it with 2 until the next non-zero number (7 at position 20).\n4. The next non-zero number is 7 at position 20. Replace the zeroes following it with 7 until the next non-zero number (5 at position 25).\n5. The last non-zero number is 5 at position 25. It remains as 5.\n\n### Predicted Output:\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 7 7 7 7 7 5\n\nThus, the output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<answer>>>\n0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 7 7 7 7 7 5\n"
