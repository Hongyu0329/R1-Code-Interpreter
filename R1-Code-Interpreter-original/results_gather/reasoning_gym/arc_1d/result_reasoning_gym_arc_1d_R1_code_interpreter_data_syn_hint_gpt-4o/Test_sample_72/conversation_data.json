    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0\n\n   Observations:\n   - The sequence of 7s is shifted to the right by 3 positions.\n   - The trailing zeros are adjusted to maintain the length of the grid.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n   Observations:\n   - The sequence of 3s is shifted to the right by 3 positions.\n   - The trailing zeros are adjusted to maintain the length of the grid.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n   Observations:\n   - The single 2 is shifted to the right by 3 positions.\n   - The zeros are adjusted accordingly.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- Identify the non-zero sequence in the input grid.\n- Shift this sequence to the right by 3 positions.\n- Fill the remaining positions with zeros to maintain the grid's length.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- **Test Input:** 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nFollowing the rule:\n- The non-zero sequence is 2 2 2.\n- Shift this sequence to the right by 3 positions.\n- Fill the remaining positions with zeros.\n\nLet's compute the output grid using this rule:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the non-zero sequence\n    non_zero_sequence = [x for x in input_grid if x != 0]\n    \n    # Create the output grid with zeros\n    output_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\n    \n    # Place the non-zero sequence shifted by 3 positions\n    for i, value in enumerate(non_zero_sequence):\n        output_grid[i + 3] = value\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the output grid for the test input.",
    "The code execution result is consistent with the expected transformation rule derived from the examples. The non-zero sequence in the input grid was correctly identified and shifted to the right by 3 positions, with zeros filling the remaining positions.\n\nThe output grid for the test input is:\n\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThis matches the expected transformation based on the rule we derived. Therefore, the final answer for the test input grid is:\n\n<<<answer>>>\n0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n<<<answer>>>"
