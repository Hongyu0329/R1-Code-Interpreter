    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze each example to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:**  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 1 5 6 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 1 5 6\n   - **Observation:** The non-zero sequence `5 1 5 6` is shifted to the end of the grid.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:**  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The non-zero number `9` is moved to the start of the grid.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:**  3 9 1 4 3 7 5 2 1 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 9 3 9 1 4 3 7 5 2 1 9 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The non-zero sequence `9 3 9 1 4 3 7 5 2 1 9` is shifted to the middle of the grid.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, it seems that the rule involves identifying the non-zero sequence in the input grid and shifting it to a specific position in the output grid. The position seems to vary:\n- In Example 1, the sequence is moved to the end.\n- In Example 2, the sequence is moved to the start.\n- In Example 3, the sequence is moved to the middle.\n\nThe rule might involve:\n1. Identifying the non-zero sequence.\n2. Shifting the sequence to a position based on some criteria (e.g., length of the sequence, position of the first non-zero element).\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nLet's apply the rule to the test input grid:\n\n- **Test Input:** 8 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 7 2 8 4 5 1 8 2\n\n1. Identify the non-zero sequence: `8 1 2`\n2. Determine the position to shift the sequence:\n   - Based on the examples, the sequence might be shifted to the start, middle, or end.\n   - Since the sequence is at the start, it might be shifted to the end.\n\nLet's generate the output grid by applying this rule:\n\n```python\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = [8, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 7, 2, 8, 4, 5, 1, 8, 2]\n\n# Identify the non-zero sequence\nnon_zero_sequence = [x for x in input_grid if x != 0]\n\n# Determine the position to shift the sequence\n# Based on the examples, let's try shifting it to the end\noutput_grid = [0] * (len(input_grid) - len(non_zero_sequence)) + non_zero_sequence\n\n# Print the output grid\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to see the output.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the output grid `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 2, 8, 7, 2, 8, 4, 5, 1, 8, 2]` does not match the expected transformation based on the examples. This suggests that the rule I initially derived might not be correct or complete.\n\n### Re-evaluating the Rule\n\nLet's re-evaluate the examples to derive a more accurate rule:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - The sequence `5 1 5 6` is moved to the end of the grid.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - The single non-zero number `9` is moved to the start of the grid.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - The sequence `9 3 9 1 4 3 7 5 2 1 9` is moved to the middle of the grid.\n\n### Observations\n\n- The non-zero sequence is moved to a specific position in the output grid.\n- The position seems to be determined by the length of the sequence or the position of the first non-zero element.\n\n### Revised Rule\n\n1. Identify the non-zero sequence in the input grid.\n2. Determine the position to shift the sequence:\n   - If the sequence is short, move it to the start.\n   - If the sequence is long, move it to the middle.\n   - If the sequence is at the start, move it to the end.\n\n### Applying the Revised Rule to the Test Input\n\nLet's apply this revised rule to the test input grid:\n\n- **Test Input:** 8 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 7 2 8 4 5 1 8 2\n\n1. Identify the non-zero sequence: `8 1 2`\n2. Determine the position to shift the sequence:\n   - Since the sequence is short, move it to the start.\n\nLet's generate the output grid by applying this revised rule:\n\n```python\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = [8, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 7, 2, 8, 4, 5, 1, 8, 2]\n\n# Identify the non-zero sequence\nnon_zero_sequence = [x for x in input_grid if x != 0]\n\n# Determine the position to shift the sequence\n# Since the sequence is short, move it to the start\noutput_grid = non_zero_sequence + [0] * (len(input_grid) - len(non_zero_sequence))\n\n# Print the output grid\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to see the output.",
    "The previous attempts to derive a rule and apply it to the test input have not yielded the correct output.
