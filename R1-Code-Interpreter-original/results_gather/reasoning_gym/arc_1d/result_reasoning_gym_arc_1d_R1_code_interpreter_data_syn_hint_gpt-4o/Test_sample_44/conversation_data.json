    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations:\n1. In each example, the number '2' in the input seems to act as a delimiter or a marker.\n2. The numbers before '2' in the input remain unchanged in the output.\n3. The numbers after '2' in the input are replaced by the numbers immediately preceding '2' in the input.\n4. The '2' itself is replaced by the number immediately preceding it in the input.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n- Identify the position of '2' in the input.\n- Replace '2' and all subsequent numbers with the number immediately preceding '2'.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0\n- The number immediately preceding '2' is '0'.\n- Replace '2' and all subsequent numbers with '0'.\n\nLet's apply this rule to generate the output for the test input.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the position of '2'\n    pos_2 = input_grid.index(2)\n    # Get the number immediately preceding '2'\n    preceding_number = input_grid[pos_2 - 1]\n    # Replace '2' and all subsequent numbers with the preceding number\n    output_grid = input_grid[:pos_2] + [preceding_number] * (len(input_grid) - pos_2)\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0]\n# Transform the test input\noutput = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the output grid for the test input based on the derived rule.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the transformation rule applied to the test input resulted in an output grid of all zeros. This suggests that the rule derived from the examples was applied correctly, as the number immediately preceding '2' in the test input was '0', and thus all numbers from '2' onwards were replaced with '0'.\n\nLet's summarize the rule and the final output:\n\n### Rule Summary:\n1. Identify the position of '2' in the input grid.\n2. Replace '2' and all subsequent numbers with the number immediately preceding '2'.\n\n### Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0\n\n### Test Output:\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe output grid is consistent with the rule derived from the examples. Therefore, the final answer for the test input is:\n\n<<<answer>>>\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n<<<answer>>>"
