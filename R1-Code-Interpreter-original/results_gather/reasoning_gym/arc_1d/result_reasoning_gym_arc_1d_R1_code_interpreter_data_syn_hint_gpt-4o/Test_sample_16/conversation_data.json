    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 2 1 0 0 9 4 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 2 1 0 0 9 4 0 0 3 0 0 0 0\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 7 7 3 0 0 1 4 0 6 9 0 3\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 7 7 3 0 0 1 4 0 6 9 3\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 5 7 6 0 1 0 6 6 0 0 0 5 2 0\n- **Output:** 0 5 7 6 0 1 0 6 6 0 0 0 5 2\n\n### Observations:\n1. In each example, the output grid is a shifted version of the input grid.\n2. The shift involves moving the first non-zero element to the start of the grid and shifting all other elements to the right.\n3. The zero at the start of the output grid is a result of this shift.\n\n### Rule:\n- Identify the first non-zero element in the input grid.\n- Move this element to the start of the output grid.\n- Shift all other elements to the right by one position.\n- The first position in the output grid is filled with zero.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 3 0 0 4 6\n- The first non-zero element is 8.\n- Move 8 to the start of the output grid.\n- Shift all other elements to the right by one position.\n- The first position in the output grid is filled with zero.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero element\n    for i, value in enumerate(input_grid):\n        if value != 0:\n            first_non_zero_index = i\n            break\n    \n    # Create the output grid\n    output_grid = [0] + input_grid[:first_non_zero_index] + input_grid[first_non_zero_index+1:]\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 3, 0, 0, 4, 6]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the output grid for the test input.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the transformation did not work as expected. The output grid should have started with the first non-zero element from the input grid, followed by the rest of the elements shifted to the right. Let's revisit the rule and correct the code.\n\n### Corrected Rule:\n1. Identify the first non-zero element in the input grid.\n2. Move this element to the start of the output grid.\n3. Shift all other elements to the right by one position.\n4. The first position in the output grid is filled with zero.\n\n### Corrected Code:\nLet's correct the code to implement this rule properly.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero element\n    first_non_zero_index = -1\n    for i, value in enumerate(input_grid):\n        if value != 0:\n            first_non_zero_index = i\n            break\n    \n    # If no non-zero element is found, return the input grid as is\n    if first_non_zero_index == -1:\n        return input_grid\n    \n    # Create the output grid\n    output_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\n    output_grid[0] = input_grid[first_non_zero_index]\n    output_grid[1:] = input_grid[:first_non_zero_index] + input_grid[first_non_zero_index+1:]\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 3, 0, 0, 4, 6]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nThis code should correctly transform the input grid according to the identified rule. Let's execute it to verify the output.",
    "The code execution result shows that the first non-zero element, 8, was correctly moved to the start of the output grid. However, the rest of the elements were not shifted correctly. The first position should be zero, and the rest of the elements should follow the shifted pattern.\n\nLet's refine the rule and the code:\n\n### Refined Rule:\n1. Identify the first non-zero element in the input grid.\n2. Move this element to the start of the output grid.\n3. Shift all other elements to the right by one position.\n4. The first position in the output grid is filled with zero.\n\n### Refined Code:\nLet's correct the code to implement this rule properly.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero element\n    first_non_zero_index = -1\n    for i, value in enumerate(input_grid):\n        if value != 0:\n            first_non_zero_index = i\n            break\n    \n    # If no non-zero element is found, return the input grid as is\n    if first_non_zero_index == -1:\n        return input_grid\n    \n    # Create the output grid\n    output_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\n    output_grid[0] = input_grid[first_non_zero_index]\n    output_grid[1:first_non_zero_index+1] = input_grid[:first_non_zero_index]\n    output_grid[first_non_zero_index+1:] = input_grid[first_non_zero_index+1:]\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 3, 0, 0, 4, 6]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nThis code should correctly transform the input grid according to the identified rule. Let's execute it to verify the output.",
    "The previous attempts to solve the problem using code have not yielded the correct results. Let's switch to a more detailed textual reasoning approach to identify the correct transformation rule.\n\n### Observations from Examples:\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 2 1 0 0 9 4 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 2 1 0 0 9 4 0 0 3 0 0 0 0\n   - The first non-zero element (2) is moved to the second position, and the rest of the elements are shifted right.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 7 7 3 0 0 1 4 0 6 9 0 3\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 7 7 3 0 0 1 4 0 6 9 3\n   - The first non-zero element (7) is moved to the third position, and the rest of the elements are shifted right.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 5 7 6 0 1 0 6 6 0 0 0 5 2 0\n   - **Output:** 0 5 7 6 0 1 0 6 6 0 0 0 5 2\n   - The first non-zero element (5) is moved to the second position, and the rest of the elements are shifted right.\n\n### General Rule:\n- The first non-zero element is moved to the position immediately after the first zero in the output grid.\n- All elements before this position are zeros.\n- The rest of the elements follow the original order from the input grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 3 0 0 4 6\n- The first non-zero element is 8.\n- Move 8 to the position immediately after the first zero in the output grid.\n- The rest of the elements follow the original order from the input grid.\n\n### Predicted Output:\n- **Output:** 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 7 3 0 0 4 6\n\nThis reasoning aligns with the transformation observed in the examples. Therefore, the predicted output for the test input is:\n\n<<<answer>>>\n0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 7 3 0 0 4 6\n<<<answer>>>"
