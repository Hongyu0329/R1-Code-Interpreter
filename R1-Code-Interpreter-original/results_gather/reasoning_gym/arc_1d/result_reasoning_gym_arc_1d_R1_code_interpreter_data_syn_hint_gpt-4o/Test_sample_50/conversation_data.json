    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n   - **Output:** 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5\n   - **Output:** 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\n   - **Output:** 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations\n\n- The output grid seems to be a rearrangement of the input grid.\n- The first few elements of the output grid are shifted versions of the input grid.\n- The number of leading non-zero elements in the output seems to be related to the number of trailing non-zero elements in the input.\n\n### Hypothesis\n\n- The rule seems to involve shifting the non-zero elements from the end of the input grid to the beginning of the output grid.\n- The number of non-zero elements at the start of the output grid is equal to the number of non-zero elements at the end of the input grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- **Test Input:** 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\n1. Count the trailing non-zero elements in the input grid: There are 9 trailing '2's.\n2. Shift these 9 '2's to the beginning of the output grid.\n3. Fill the rest of the output grid with the remaining elements from the input grid.\n\n### Constructing the Output\n\nFollowing the rule, the output grid should be:\n\n- **Output:** 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThis output grid is constructed by shifting the trailing '2's from the input to the start of the output.\n\n<<<answer>>>\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n"
