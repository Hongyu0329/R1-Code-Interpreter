    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Analysis of Examples:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of 1s is shifted one position to the left, and a 0 is added at the end.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of 1s is shifted one position to the left, and a 0 is added at the end.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of 1s is shifted one position to the left, and a 0 is added at the end.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\n\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- Identify the sequence of 1s in the input grid.\n- Shift this sequence one position to the left.\n- Add a 0 at the end of the grid to maintain the same length.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n\n**Test Input:**\n8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n- The input grid does not contain any 1s, so the rule of shifting 1s does not apply directly.\n- However, the rule of shifting the sequence of non-zero numbers (in this case, 8s) to the left and adding a 0 at the end can be applied.\n\n**Predicted Output:**\n8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThus, the output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<answer>>>\n8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"
