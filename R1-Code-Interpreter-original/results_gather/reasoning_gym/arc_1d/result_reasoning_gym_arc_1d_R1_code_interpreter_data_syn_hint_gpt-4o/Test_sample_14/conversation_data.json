    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0\n\n### Observations:\n1. The non-zero numbers in the input grid are shifted to the left in the output grid.\n2. The number of non-zero elements remains the same.\n3. The non-zero elements are shifted to the leftmost position possible, while maintaining their order.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n- Identify the first and last positions of the non-zero sequence in the input grid.\n- Shift this sequence to the leftmost position in the output grid, filling the remaining positions with zeros.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n- The non-zero sequence is \"1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\", starting from index 11 to 21.\n- Shift this sequence to the leftmost position in the output grid.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to generate the output for the test input.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first and last non-zero indices\n    first_non_zero = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), None)\n    last_non_zero = len(input_grid) - next((i for i, x in enumerate(reversed(input_grid)) if x != 0), None) - 1\n    \n    # Extract the non-zero sequence\n    non_zero_sequence = input_grid[first_non_zero:last_non_zero + 1]\n    \n    # Create the output grid\n    output_grid = non_zero_sequence + [0] * (len(input_grid) - len(non_zero_sequence))\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\noutput = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output for the test input.",
    "The code execution result is correct, and it matches the expected transformation based on the rule derived from the examples. The non-zero sequence \"1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\" from the test input is shifted to the leftmost position in the output grid, and the remaining positions are filled with zeros.\n\nThe rule was applied correctly, and the output grid is as expected. Therefore, the final answer for the test input is:\n\n<<<answer>>>\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n<<<answer>>>"
