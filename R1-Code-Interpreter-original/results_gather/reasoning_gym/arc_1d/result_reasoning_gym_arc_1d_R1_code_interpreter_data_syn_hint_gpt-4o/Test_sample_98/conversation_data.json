    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples to deduce the rule.\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 4 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 4 4 4\n   - **Observation:** The sequence \"4 0 0\" in the input becomes \"4 4 4\" in the output.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 1 1 1 1 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 9 0 9 9 9 9 0 9 9 9 9 0 1 1 1 1 0 2 2 2 2 0 2\n   - **Observation:** The sequence \"9 0\" in the input becomes \"9 0 9 9 9 9 0 9 9 9 9\" in the output, and \"2 0 0 0\" becomes \"2 2 2 2 0 2\".\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence \"1 0 0 0\" in the input becomes \"1 1 1 1 0\" in the output.\n\n### Rule Deduction\n\nFrom the examples, it seems that:\n- When a non-zero number is followed by zeros, the non-zero number is repeated to fill the zeros in the output.\n- The repetition continues until the next non-zero number or the end of the grid is reached.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\n**Test Input:**\n0 0 0 0 7 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n- The sequence \"7 0\" should become \"7 7\" in the output.\n- The sequence \"1 1 1 0\" should remain \"1 1 1 0\" as there are no zeros to fill after the ones.\n\n**Predicted Output:**\n0 0 0 0 7 7 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThus, the final output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<answer>>>\n0 0 0 0 7 7 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n"
