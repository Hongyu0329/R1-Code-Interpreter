    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations:\n1. The sequence of non-zero numbers in the input grid is shifted to the left in the output grid.\n2. The number of positions shifted seems to be determined by the position of the first non-zero number in the input grid.\n3. The non-zero sequence in the output grid starts at the position where the first non-zero number in the input grid was found.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n- Identify the first non-zero number in the input grid.\n- Shift the sequence of non-zero numbers to the left, starting from the position of the first non-zero number in the input grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- The first non-zero number (8) is at position 10.\n- Shift the sequence of 8s to start at position 10.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to predict the output for the test input.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero number\n    first_non_zero_index = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), None)\n    \n    # If no non-zero number is found, return the input as is\n    if first_non_zero_index is None:\n        return input_grid\n    \n    # Extract the sequence of non-zero numbers\n    non_zero_sequence = [x for x in input_grid if x != 0]\n    \n    # Create the output grid\n    output_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\n    \n    # Place the non-zero sequence starting from the first non-zero index\n    output_grid[first_non_zero_index:first_non_zero_index + len(non_zero_sequence)] = non_zero_sequence\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n# Get the output\ntest_output = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(test_output)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output for the test input.",
    "The code execution result matches the expected transformation based on the derived rule. The rule was to shift the sequence of non-zero numbers to the left, starting from the position of the first non-zero number in the input grid. The output grid for the test input is correctly generated as:\n\n\\[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0\\]\n\nThis matches the expected transformation, confirming that the rule was applied correctly.\n\nNow, I will provide the final answer for the test input grid.\n\n<<<answer>>>\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n<<<answer>>>"
