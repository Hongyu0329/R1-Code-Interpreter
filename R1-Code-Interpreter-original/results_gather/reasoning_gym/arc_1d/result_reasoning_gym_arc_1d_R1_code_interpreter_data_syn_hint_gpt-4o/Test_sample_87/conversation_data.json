    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Observations:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 1 2 1 2 0 0 2 2\n   - Output: 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: 2 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 2 1 0\n   - Output: 2 2 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: 0 1 1 2 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 1\n   - Output: 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- The output grid always starts with a sequence of '2's followed by '1's and then '0's.\n- The number of '2's in the output seems to correspond to the number of '2's in the input.\n- The number of '1's in the output seems to correspond to the number of '1's in the input.\n- The rest of the output is filled with '0's.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n\n1. Count the number of '2's in the input grid.\n2. Count the number of '1's in the input grid.\n3. Construct the output grid by placing the counted number of '2's first, followed by the counted number of '1's, and fill the rest with '0's.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n\n- **Test Input:** 0 1 0 0 2 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 2 0\n- Count of '2's: 2\n- Count of '1's: 4\n- Construct the output: Start with two '2's, followed by four '1's, and fill the rest with '0's.\n\nLet's construct the output grid using the derived rule:\n\n```python\n# Test input grid\ninput_grid = [0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0]\n\n# Count the number of 2's and 1's\ncount_2 = input_grid.count(2)\ncount_1 = input_grid.count(1)\n\n# Construct the output grid\noutput_grid = [2] * count_2 + [1] * count_1 + [0] * (len(input_grid) - count_2 - count_1)\n\n# Print the output grid\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nExecuting the code will give us the predicted output grid for the test input.",
    "The code execution result matches our expectations based on the derived rule. The output grid `[2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` correctly reflects the transformation rule we identified: counting the number of '2's and '1's in the input and arranging them in the output grid accordingly.\n\nThe rule was applied correctly, and the output grid is consistent with the pattern observed in the examples. Therefore, the final answer for the test input grid is:\n\n<<<answer>>>\n2 2 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n<<<answer>>>"
