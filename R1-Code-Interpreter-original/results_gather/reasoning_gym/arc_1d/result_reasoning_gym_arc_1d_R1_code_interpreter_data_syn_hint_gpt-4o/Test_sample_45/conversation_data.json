    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n**Example 1:**\n- **Input:** 4 0 8 0 0 9 0 0 0 8 4 0 0 6 9 0 0 4 4 0\n- **Output:** 4 8 9 8 4 6 9 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Example 2:**\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 4 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 9 0 9 7 0 0 0 8 3\n- **Output:** 4 8 9 9 7 8 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Example 3:**\n- **Input:** 0 1 1 0 0 5 0 0 0 8 0 0 9 8 0 0 0 0 8 1\n- **Output:** 1 1 5 8 9 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations\n1. The output grid seems to be a rearrangement of the non-zero elements from the input grid.\n2. The non-zero elements in the input are moved to the beginning of the output grid, maintaining their order.\n3. The remaining positions in the output grid are filled with zeros.\n\n### Rule Derivation\nThe rule can be summarized as:\n- Extract all non-zero elements from the input grid.\n- Place these non-zero elements at the beginning of the output grid in the same order they appear in the input.\n- Fill the rest of the output grid with zeros.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid.\n\n**Test Input:**\n0 8 7 0 3 4 0 3 1 0 9 0 0 0 0 9 2 7 5 4\n\n1. Extract non-zero elements: 8, 7, 3, 4, 3, 1, 9, 9, 2, 7, 5, 4\n2. Place them at the beginning of the output grid: 8, 7, 3, 4, 3, 1, 9, 9, 2, 7, 5, 4\n3. Fill the rest with zeros to maintain the same length as the input grid.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this process and generate the output grid.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Extract non-zero elements\n    non_zero_elements = [x for x in input_grid if x != 0]\n    # Calculate the number of zeros needed\n    num_zeros = len(input_grid) - len(non_zero_elements)\n    # Create the output grid\n    output_grid = non_zero_elements + [0] * num_zeros\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 8, 7, 0, 3, 4, 0, 3, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 2, 7, 5, 4]\n# Transform the grid\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the output grid for the test input.",
    "The code execution result matches our expectations based on the derived rule. The output grid is correctly formed by placing all non-zero elements from the input grid at the beginning, followed by zeros to fill the remaining positions.\n\nThe rule we derived and implemented in the code is consistent with the examples provided, and the output grid for the test input is as expected.\n\nTherefore, the final output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<answer>>>\n8 7 3 4 3 1 9 9 2 7 5 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n<<<answer>>>"
