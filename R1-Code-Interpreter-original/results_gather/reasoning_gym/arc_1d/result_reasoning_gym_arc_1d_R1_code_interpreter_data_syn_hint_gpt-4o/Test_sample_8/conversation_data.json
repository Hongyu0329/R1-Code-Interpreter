    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations:\n1. In each example, there is a sequence of non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n2. The sequence of non-zero numbers is moved to the beginning of the output grid.\n3. The position of the number '2' remains unchanged in the output grid.\n4. The rest of the grid is filled with zeros.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n- Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n- Move this sequence to the beginning of the output grid.\n- Keep the position of the number '2' unchanged.\n- Fill the rest of the grid with zeros.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0\n- The sequence of non-zero numbers is '3 3 3 3 3 3 3'.\n- Move this sequence to the beginning of the output grid.\n- Keep the position of '2' unchanged.\n- Fill the rest with zeros.\n\nLet's implement this logic in code to generate the output grid.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the sequence of non-zero numbers\n    non_zero_sequence = [x for x in input_grid if x != 0 and x != 2]\n    \n    # Find the position of '2'\n    position_of_two = input_grid.index(2)\n    \n    # Create the output grid\n    output_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\n    \n    # Place the non-zero sequence at the beginning\n    output_grid[:len(non_zero_sequence)] = non_zero_sequence\n    \n    # Place '2' at its original position\n    output_grid[position_of_two] = 2\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the output grid for the test input.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the transformation rule was applied correctly, as the sequence of '3's was moved to the beginning of the grid, and the '2' was kept in its original position. The rest of the grid was filled with zeros, which matches the expected transformation rule derived from the examples.\n\nThe output grid for the test input is:\n\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThis matches the expected transformation based on the rule we derived. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>>\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n"
