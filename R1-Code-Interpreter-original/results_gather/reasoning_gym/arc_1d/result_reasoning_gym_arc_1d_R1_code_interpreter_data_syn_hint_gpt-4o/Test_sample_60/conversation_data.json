    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples step by step:\n\n### Example 1 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0\n\nObservations:\n- The first row remains unchanged.\n- The second row changes from \"0 0 0 0 9\" to \"0 0 9 9 9\".\n- The third row changes from \"0 0 0 0 0\" to \"0 0 0 0 0\".\n- The fourth row changes from \"0 0 0 0 0\" to \"0 0 0 0 0\".\n- The fifth row changes from \"0 0 0 0 0\" to \"0 0 0 0 0\".\n\n### Example 2 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0\n\nObservations:\n- The first row remains unchanged.\n- The second row changes from \"0 0 0 0 0\" to \"0 0 0 0 0\".\n- The third row changes from \"0 0 3 0 0\" to \"3 3 3 3 3\".\n- The fourth row changes from \"0 0 0 0 0\" to \"0 0 0 0 0\".\n- The fifth row changes from \"0 0 0 0 0\" to \"0 0 0 0 0\".\n\n### Example 3 Analysis:\n- **Input:** 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nObservations:\n- The first row remains unchanged.\n- The second row changes from \"0 0 0 0 3\" to \"0 0 3 3 3\".\n- The third row changes from \"0 0 0 0 0\" to \"0 0 0 0 0\".\n- The fourth row changes from \"0 0 0 0 0\" to \"0 0 0 0 0\".\n- The fifth row changes from \"0 0 0 0 0\" to \"0 0 0 0 0\".\n\n### Rule Derivation:\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n1. The first row remains unchanged.\n2. For the second row, if there is a non-zero number at the end, it is shifted to the left by two positions, and the last two positions are filled with the same non-zero number.\n3. For the third row, if there is a non-zero number in the middle, the entire row is filled with that non-zero number.\n4. The fourth and fifth rows remain unchanged.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 3 3 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n\nLet's apply the rule:\n1. The first row remains unchanged: `3 3 3 0 0`.\n2. The second row changes from `0 3 0 0 0` to `0 0 3 3 3`.\n3. The third row changes from `0 0 3 0 0` to `3 3 3 3 3`.\n4. The fourth row remains unchanged: `0 0 0 0 0`.\n5. The fifth row remains unchanged: `0 0 0 0 0`.\n\nThus, the output grid is:\n```\n3 3 3 0 0\n0 0 3 3 3\n3 3 3 3 3\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nNow, let's format the output grid as a single line for the final answer.\n\n<<<answer>>>\n3 3 3 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n"
