    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Observations:\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - Input: 8 8 0 0 1 1 0 0 8 8 0 0 7 0 0\n   - Output: 8 8 3 3 1 1 3 3 8 8 3 0 7 0 0\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input: 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 6 6 0 0\n   - Output: 1 0 0 0 0 3 1 1 3 0 3 6 6 3 0\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - Input: 5 5 0 0 2 2 0 0 6 0 0 0 1 1 0\n   - Output: 5 5 3 3 2 2 3 0 6 0 0 3 1 1 3\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- The number `3` appears in the output grid in positions where there were `0`s in the input grid, but not all `0`s are replaced by `3`s.\n- The `3`s seem to appear in the output grid in a pattern that is consistent across all examples:\n  - The first two `0`s after the first non-zero sequence are replaced by `3`s.\n  - The first `0` after the second non-zero sequence is replaced by `3`.\n  - The last `0` is replaced by `3`.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n\nFrom the analysis, the rule can be described as follows:\n- Identify sequences of non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n- Replace the first two `0`s after the first non-zero sequence with `3`s.\n- Replace the first `0` after the second non-zero sequence with `3`.\n- Replace the last `0` in the grid with `3`.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n\nTest Input: 4 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 9 9 9 0 0 0 0\n\n- First non-zero sequence: `4`\n  - Replace the first two `0`s after `4` with `3`s: `4 3 3 5 5 0 0 0 9 9 9 0 0 0 0`\n- Second non-zero sequence: `5 5`\n  - Replace the first `0` after `5 5` with `3`: `4 3 3 5 5 3 0 0 9 9 9 0 0 0 0`\n- Replace the last `0` with `3`: `4 3 3 5 5 3 0 0 9 9 9 0 0 0 3`\n\nThus, the output grid for the test input is:\n\n4 3 3 5 5 3 0 0 9 9 9 0 0 0 3\n\n<<<answer>>>4 3 3 5 5 3 0 0 9 9 9 0 0 0 3<<<answer>>>"
