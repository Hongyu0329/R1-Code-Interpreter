    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations:\n1. In each example, the sequence of non-zero numbers in the input grid is shifted to the right in the output grid.\n2. The number of zeros at the beginning of the output grid increases compared to the input grid.\n3. The non-zero sequence in the input grid is shifted such that it starts later in the output grid, and the sequence is preserved.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n- Identify the first non-zero element in the input grid.\n- Shift the sequence of non-zero elements to the right by a certain number of positions.\n- The number of positions to shift seems to be determined by the length of the sequence of non-zero elements.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- The sequence of non-zero elements is \"8 8 8 8\".\n- The length of this sequence is 4.\n- Shift this sequence to the right by 4 positions.\n\nLet's apply this rule to generate the output for the test input:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero element\n    first_non_zero_index = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), None)\n    \n    # If no non-zero element is found, return the input as output\n    if first_non_zero_index is None:\n        return input_grid\n    \n    # Find the sequence of non-zero elements\n    non_zero_sequence = []\n    for i in range(first_non_zero_index, len(input_grid)):\n        if input_grid[i] == 0:\n            break\n        non_zero_sequence.append(input_grid[i])\n    \n    # Calculate the shift amount\n    shift_amount = len(non_zero_sequence)\n    \n    # Create the output grid\n    output_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\n    start_index = first_non_zero_index + shift_amount\n    output_grid[start_index:start_index + len(non_zero_sequence)] = non_zero_sequence\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the output grid for the test input.",
