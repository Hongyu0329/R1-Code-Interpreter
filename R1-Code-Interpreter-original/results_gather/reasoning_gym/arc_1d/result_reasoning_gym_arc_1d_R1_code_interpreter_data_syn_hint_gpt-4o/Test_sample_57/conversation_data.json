    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations:\n1. The output grid seems to shift the sequence of non-zero numbers to the left.\n2. The number of zeros at the beginning of the input grid is reduced in the output grid.\n3. The sequence of non-zero numbers remains the same but starts earlier in the output grid.\n4. The trailing zeros in the output grid increase to maintain the same total length as the input grid.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n- Identify the first non-zero number in the input grid.\n- Shift this sequence of non-zero numbers to the left, starting from the first zero position in the input grid.\n- Fill the remaining positions with zeros to maintain the grid length.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- The first non-zero number is 6, starting from the 13th position.\n- Shift the sequence of six 6's to the left, starting from the first zero position.\n- Fill the remaining positions with zeros.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to predict the output for the test input.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero number\n    first_non_zero_index = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), None)\n    \n    # If there is no non-zero number, return the input grid as is\n    if first_non_zero_index is None:\n        return input_grid\n    \n    # Extract the sequence of non-zero numbers\n    non_zero_sequence = input_grid[first_non_zero_index:]\n    \n    # Calculate the number of leading zeros in the output\n    leading_zeros = len(input_grid) - len(non_zero_sequence)\n    \n    # Construct the output grid\n    output_grid = [0] * leading_zeros + non_zero_sequence\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output for the test input.",

The input grid contains a sequence of zeros followed by a sequence of non-zero numbers and then zeros again.\n2. The output grid shifts the sequence of non-zero numbers to the left, starting from the first zero position in the input grid.\n3. The trailing zeros in the output grid increase to maintain the same total length as the input grid.\n\n### Corrected Rule:\n- Identify the first non-zero number in the input grid.\n- Shift the sequence of non-zero numbers to the left, starting from the first zero position in the input grid.\n- Fill the remaining positions with zeros to maintain the grid length.\n\nLet's implement this refined logic in Python to predict the output for the test input.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero number\n    first_non_zero_index = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), None)\n    \n    # If there is no non-zero number, return the input grid as is\n    if first_non_zero_index is None:\n        return input_grid\n    \n    # Extract the sequence of non-zero numbers\n    non_zero_sequence = [x for x in input_grid if x != 0]\n    \n    # Calculate the number of leading zeros in the output\n    leading_zeros = len(input_grid) - len(non_zero_sequence)\n    \n    # Construct the output grid\n    output_grid = [0] * leading_zeros + non_zero_sequence\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code again to get the correct output for the test input.",
