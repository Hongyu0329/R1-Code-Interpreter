    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples one by one:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n\n**Observation:** \n- The number '2' in the input is replaced by '8' in the output.\n- The sequence of '8's remains unchanged.\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 2 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:**\n- The number '2' in the input is replaced by '9' in the output.\n- The sequence of '9's remains unchanged.\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n\n**Observation:**\n- The number '2' in the input is replaced by '3' in the output.\n- The sequence of '3's remains unchanged.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- Identify the first occurrence of the number '2' in the input grid.\n- Replace this '2' with the number that follows it in the input grid.\n- The rest of the grid remains unchanged.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 2 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Identify the first occurrence of '2', which is at the start of the grid.\n2. The number following '2' is '0'.\n3. Replace '2' with '0'.\n\nThus, the output grid should be:\n0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n\n<<<answer>>>\n0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n<<<answer>>>"
