    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 5 5 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 5 5\n- **Output:** 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 5\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0\n\n### Observations:\n1. In each example, the input grid is transformed by shifting the sequence of numbers to the right by one position.\n2. The number that is shifted out from the right end is inserted at the position where the first zero appears in the input grid.\n3. The rest of the numbers remain in their original order, except for this shift.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n- Identify the first zero in the input grid.\n- Shift the sequence of numbers to the right by one position.\n- Insert the number that was shifted out at the position of the first zero.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6\n- The first zero appears at the 4th position.\n- Shift the sequence to the right: 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- Insert the shifted-out number (6) at the position of the first zero.\n\n### Test Output:\n- **Output:** 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThus, the output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<answer>>>\n6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0"
