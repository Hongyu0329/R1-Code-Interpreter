    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 9 2 7 4 7 7 4 3 2 6 3 8 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 9 2 7 4 7 7 4 3 2 6 3 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 1 2 2 8 7 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 8 1 2 2 8 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 2 8 5 1 3 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 8 2 8 5 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations:\n1. In each example, the output grid is longer than the input grid by one element.\n2. The non-zero elements in the input grid are shifted to the left in the output grid, and the remaining positions are filled with zeros.\n3. The number of leading zeros in the output grid is equal to the number of leading zeros in the input grid minus one.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n- Identify the first non-zero element in the input grid.\n- Shift all elements from this position to the end of the input grid to the left by one position.\n- Fill the remaining positions with zeros.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 6 3 5 1 7 9 1 2 4 9 6 3 2 0 0\n- The first non-zero element is 6 (at index 4).\n- Shift elements from index 4 to the end to the left by one position.\n- Fill the remaining positions with zeros.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to generate the output grid for the test input.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero element\n    first_non_zero_index = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), len(input_grid))\n    \n    # Create the output grid by shifting elements to the left\n    output_grid = input_grid[first_non_zero_index:] + [0] * (first_non_zero_index + 1)\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 3, 5, 1, 7, 9, 1, 2, 4, 9, 6, 3, 2, 0, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will provide the output grid for the test input.",
    "The code execution result shows that the output grid is longer than expected. This indicates that the logic for determining the length of the output grid is incorrect. Let's revisit the rule and correct the implementation.\n\n### Corrected Rule:\n1. Identify the first non-zero element in the input grid.\n2. Shift all elements from this position to the end of the input grid to the left by one position.\n3. The output grid should have the same length as the input grid, with the remaining positions filled with zeros.\n\n### Corrected Implementation:\nLet's adjust the code to ensure the output grid has the same length as the input grid.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero element\n    first_non_zero_index = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), len(input_grid))\n    \n    # Create the output grid by shifting elements to the left\n    shifted_elements = input_grid[first_non_zero_index:]\n    output_grid = shifted_elements + [0] * (len(input_grid) - len(shifted_elements))\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 3, 5, 1, 7, 9, 1, 2, 4, 9, 6, 3, 2, 0, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nThis code should correctly generate the output grid with the same length as the input grid. Let's execute this corrected code.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the output grid is still not matching the expected pattern. Let's re-evaluate the problem and the transformation rule.\n\n### Observations:\n1. The output grid should have one more element than the input grid.\n2. The non-zero elements in the input grid are shifted to the left in the output grid.\n3.
