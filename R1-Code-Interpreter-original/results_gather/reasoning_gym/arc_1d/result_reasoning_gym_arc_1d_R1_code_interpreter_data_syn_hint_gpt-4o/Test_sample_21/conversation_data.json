    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples one by one:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n- **Output:** 6 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n- **Output:** 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n### Observations:\n1. In Example 1, the first five elements of the input are replaced with zeros in the output, and the last two elements are also replaced with zeros.\n2. In Example 2, the first four elements of the input are replaced with zeros in the output.\n3. In Example 3, the input and output are identical, indicating no transformation is needed when the input is uniform.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n- The transformation seems to involve replacing a certain number of elements at the beginning and/or end of the input with zeros, depending on the pattern of the input.\n- The number of elements replaced with zeros at the beginning and end seems to be related to the presence of zeros in the input.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n- The input has a long sequence of zeros at the beginning and end, with two 6s in the middle.\n- Based on the examples, it seems that the transformation involves maintaining the sequence of non-zero numbers in the middle and replacing the surrounding zeros with zeros.\n\n### Predicted Output:\n- The output should maintain the two 6s in the middle and replace the surrounding zeros with zeros.\n\nTherefore, the predicted output grid is:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n\n<<<answer>>> 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 <<<answer>>>"
