    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n**Example 1:**\n- **Input:** 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 8 8 8 8 2 2 2 2 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0\n\n**Example 2:**\n- **Input:** 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 8 2 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Example 3:**\n- **Input:** 0 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 8 2 0 8 8 8 8 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations\n1. The transformation seems to involve changing some of the '2's to '8's.\n2. The first few '2's in the input are transformed to '8's in the output.\n3. The number of '8's at the beginning of the output seems to match the number of '2's at the start of the input until a '0' is encountered.\n4. After the first '0' in the input, the transformation stops changing '2's to '8's.\n\n### Rule Derivation\nBased on the observations, the rule can be described as follows:\n- Traverse the input grid from the start.\n- Change each '2' to '8' until a '0' is encountered.\n- After encountering the first '0', leave the rest of the grid unchanged.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n**Test Input:**\n0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 0\n\n- The first element is '0', so no '2's are changed to '8's.\n- The rest of the grid remains unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the output grid for the test input is the same as the input grid.\n\n<<<answer>>>\n0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 0\n<<<answer>>>"
