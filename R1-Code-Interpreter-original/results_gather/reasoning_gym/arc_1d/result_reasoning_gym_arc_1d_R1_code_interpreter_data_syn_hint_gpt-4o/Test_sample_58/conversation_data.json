    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 8\n- **Output:** 8 8 8 8 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 5 5\n- **Output:** 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 5 5 5 5 5\n\n### Observations:\n1. The input and output grids are both 12 elements long.\n2. The transformation seems to involve shifting or rotating elements.\n3. In each example, a sequence of zeros in the input is shifted to a different position in the output.\n4. The non-zero elements are shifted or rotated around the zeros.\n\n### Hypothesis:\n- The transformation involves rotating the grid such that the sequence of zeros is moved to a different position.\n- Specifically, the zeros are moved to the middle of the grid, and the non-zero elements are rotated around them.\n\n### Test Input:\n- **Input:** 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0\n\n### Applying the Rule:\n- The sequence of zeros (0 0 0 0) should be moved to the middle of the grid.\n- The non-zero elements (6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6) should be rotated around the zeros.\n\n### Predicted Output:\n- The zeros should be placed in the middle, and the non-zero elements should be rotated around them.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n- **Input:** 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6\n\nThus, the predicted output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<answer>>>\n6 6 6 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6\n"
