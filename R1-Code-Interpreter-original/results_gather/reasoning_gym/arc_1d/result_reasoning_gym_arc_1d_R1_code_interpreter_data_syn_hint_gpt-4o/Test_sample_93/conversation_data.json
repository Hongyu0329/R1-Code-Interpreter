    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples one by one:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 2 7 9 8 3 2 1 5 3 6 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 9 8 3 2 1 5 3 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 7\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 9 5 1 3 8 3 8 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n- **Output:** 8 3 8 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 9 5 1 3\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations:\n1. In Example 1, the sequence `2 7` from the input is moved to the end of the output, and the rest of the numbers are shifted to the left.\n2. In Example 2, the sequence `9 5 1 3` from the input is moved to the end of the output, and the rest of the numbers are shifted to the left.\n3. In Example 3, the sequence `3` from the input is moved to the end of the output, and the rest of the numbers are shifted to the left.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\nThe rule seems to involve identifying a sequence of non-zero numbers at the beginning of the input and moving them to the end of the output, while shifting the remaining numbers to the left.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 2 7 0\n\nFollowing the rule:\n1. Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers at the beginning: `7 2 7`.\n2. Move this sequence to the end of the output.\n3. Shift the remaining numbers to the left.\n\nLet's implement this logic in code to verify and generate the output for the test input.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero sequence\n    non_zero_sequence = []\n    for num in input_grid:\n        if num != 0:\n            non_zero_sequence.append(num)\n        elif non_zero_sequence:\n            break\n    \n    # Remove the non-zero sequence from the input grid\n    remaining_grid = [num for num in input_grid if num not in non_zero_sequence]\n    \n    # Construct the output grid\n    output_grid = remaining_grid + non_zero_sequence\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 2, 7, 0]\noutput = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the output for the test input.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the output is not as expected. The issue arises because the code incorrectly identifies the sequence of non-zero numbers. Let's revisit the problem and refine our approach.\n\n### Observations:\nUpon closer inspection, the rule seems to involve identifying a sequence of non-zero numbers towards the end of the input and moving them to the beginning of the output, while shifting the remaining numbers to the right.\n\n### Revised Rule:\n1. Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers towards the end of the input.\n2. Move this sequence to the beginning of the output.\n3. Shift the remaining numbers to the right.\n\n### Applying the Revised Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 2 7 0\n\nFollowing the revised rule:\n1. Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers towards the end: `7 2 7`.\n2. Move this sequence to the beginning of the output.\n3.

    "The code execution result indicates that the output is still not as expected. Let's re-evaluate the problem and the examples to derive a more accurate rule.\n\n### Observations:\nUpon reviewing the examples again, it seems the rule involves identifying a sequence of non-zero numbers from the input and rearranging them in a specific manner in the output. The sequence of non-zero numbers is moved to a specific position in the output, and the rest of the numbers are shifted accordingly.\n\n### Revised Rule:\n1.
