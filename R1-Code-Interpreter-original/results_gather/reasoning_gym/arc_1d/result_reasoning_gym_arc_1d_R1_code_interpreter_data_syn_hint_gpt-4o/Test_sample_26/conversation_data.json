    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 6 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n- **Output:** 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8\n- **Output:** 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8\n\n### Observations:\n1. The input and output grids are both 16 elements long.\n2. The transformation seems to involve shifting a segment of the grid.\n3. In each example, a segment of the grid is shifted to the left or right, and the rest of the grid is filled with the same number as the shifted segment.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n- Identify the segment of the grid that is different from the rest (e.g., a sequence of zeros or a different number).\n- Shift this segment to the left or right, depending on the example.\n- Fill the rest of the grid with the number that was shifted.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n- The segment \"0 0\" is different from the rest.\n- In the examples, the segment is shifted to the left or right, and the rest is filled with the number that was shifted.\n- For this input, shifting \"0 0\" to the left and filling the rest with \"2\" seems consistent with the examples.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n- **Output:** 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nThus, the predicted output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<answer>>>\n2 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n"
