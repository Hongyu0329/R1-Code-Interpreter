    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze each example to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 3 7 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 3 7 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence \"9 3 7\" is moved from the 9th position to the 7th position.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 6 6 9 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 1 8\n   - **Output:** 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 1 8 6 6 9\n   - **Observation:** The sequence \"2\" is moved from the 4th position to the 1st position, and the sequence \"3 1 8\" is moved from the 13th position to the 10th position.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 7 7 7 7 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence \"7 7 7 7 3 2\" is moved from the 4th position to the 1st position.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, it seems that the rule involves identifying a non-zero sequence in the input grid and moving it to the leftmost position in the output grid, while maintaining the order of the sequence. The rest of the grid is filled with zeros.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0\n- **Identified Sequence:** The non-zero sequence is \"7\" starting from the 13th position.\n- **Output:** Move \"7\" to the leftmost position, resulting in \"7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\".\n\nThus, the output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<answer>>>\n7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n"
