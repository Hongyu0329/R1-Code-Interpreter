    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 2 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 7 7 7 7 7 0 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations:\n1. The input grid seems to be a 5x5 matrix, and the output grid is also a 5x5 matrix.\n2. The first row of the input is always copied directly to the output.\n3. The second row of the input is transformed such that the first non-zero element is replaced by the number from the first row, and the rest of the row is filled with that number.\n4. The third row of the input is transformed similarly, with the first non-zero element being replaced and the rest of the row filled with that number.\n5. The fourth row of the input is transformed similarly, with the first non-zero element being replaced and the rest of the row filled with that number.\n6. The fifth row of the input remains unchanged in the output.\n\n### Rule:\n- For each row from the second to the fourth, replace the first non-zero element with the number from the first row and fill the rest of the row with that number.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n### Test Input:\n- **Input:** 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Applying the Rule:\n1. First row remains the same: `1 1 1 1 1`\n2. Second row: Replace the first non-zero element (which is 1) with 1 and fill the rest: `0 1 1 1 1`\n3. Third row: Replace the first non-zero element (which is 1) with 1 and fill the rest: `0 0 1 1 1`\n4. Fourth row: Replace the first non-zero element (which is 1) with 1 and fill the rest: `0 0 0 1 1`\n5. Fifth row remains the same: `0 0 0 0 0`\n\n### Predicted Output:\n- **Output:** 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0\n\nThus, the predicted output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<answer>>>\n1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0\n"
