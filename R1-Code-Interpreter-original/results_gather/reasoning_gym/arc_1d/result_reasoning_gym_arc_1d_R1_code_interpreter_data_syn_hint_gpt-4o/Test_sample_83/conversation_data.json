    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 2 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n   - **Output:** 2 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2 2\n   - **Output:** 2 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 2 1 0 2 0 0 1 2 1 0 2 2 2\n   - **Output:** 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations\n\n- The output grid always starts with a sequence of 2s followed by 1s, and then 0s.\n- The number of 2s in the output seems to correspond to the number of 2s in the input.\n- The number of 1s in the output seems to correspond to the number of 1s in the input.\n- The rest of the grid is filled with 0s.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the observations, we can derive the following rule:\n- Count the number of 2s in the input grid. Let this count be `count_2`.\n- Count the number of 1s in the input grid. Let this count be `count_1`.\n- The output grid will have `count_2` number of 2s followed by `count_1` number of 1s, and the rest will be 0s.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- **Test Input:** 2 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2 1 1\n\n1. Count the number of 2s: There are 3 occurrences of 2.\n2. Count the number of 1s: There are 4 occurrences of 1.\n\nAccording to the rule, the output grid should have 3 twos, followed by 4 ones, and the rest should be zeros.\n\n### Constructing the Output Grid\n\nThe output grid will be:\n- Three 2s: 2 2 2\n- Four 1s: 1 1 1 1\n- The rest are 0s to fill up to 16 elements.\n\nThus, the output grid is: 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n<<<answer>>>\n2 2 2 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n"
