    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples one by one:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 3 1 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 3 1 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:** The sequence \"9 3 1 4\" is shifted to the left by 3 positions.\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 2 6 6 9 2 5 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 7 9 6 5 9 2 7 8 2\n- **Output:** 9 2 5 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 7 9 6 5 9 2 7 8 2 2 6 6\n\n**Observation:** The sequence \"9 2 5 9\" is shifted to the left by 4 positions.\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 6 5 3 2 2 5 6 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 6 5 3 2 2 5 6 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Observation:** The sequence \"6 5 3 2 2 5 6 4\" is shifted to the left by 2 positions.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\nFrom the examples, it seems that the rule involves identifying a non-zero sequence in the input and shifting it to the left by a certain number of positions. The number of positions to shift seems to be determined by the position of the first non-zero element in the sequence.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 6 8 4 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 2\n\n1. Identify the first non-zero sequence: \"6 8 4 9\"\n2. The first non-zero element \"6\" is at position 0.\n3. Shift the sequence \"6 8 4 9\" to the left by 0 positions (since it's already at the start).\n\nThus, the output grid should be:\n6 8 4 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 2\n\n<<<answer>>>\n6 8 4 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 2\n"
