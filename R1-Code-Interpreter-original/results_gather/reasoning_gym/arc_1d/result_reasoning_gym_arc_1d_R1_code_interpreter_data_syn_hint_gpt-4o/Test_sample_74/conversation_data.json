    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 5 0 8 8 0 4 0 8\n   - **Output:** 0 0 5 0 5 5 0 5 0 5\n\n   Observations:\n   - The number 5 in the input remains unchanged in the output.\n   - The number 8 in the input is transformed to 5 in the output.\n   - The number 4 in the input is transformed to 5 in the output.\n   - The number 0 remains unchanged.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 6 2 6 0 7 2 0 3 0\n   - **Output:** 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 0\n\n   Observations:\n   - The numbers 6, 2, 7, and 3 in the input are transformed to 5 in the output.\n   - The number 0 remains unchanged.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 9 5 7 3 3 6 0 0 0 3\n   - **Output:** 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 5\n\n   Observations:\n   - The numbers 9, 5, 7, 3, and 6 in the input are transformed to 5 in the output.\n   - The number 0 remains unchanged.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- Any non-zero number in the input grid is transformed to 5 in the output grid.\n- The number 0 remains unchanged.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 8 0 7 9 7 0\n\nUsing the rule:\n- Transform any non-zero number to 5.\n- Keep 0 as 0.\n\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 5 0 5 5 5 0\n\nThus, the output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<answer>>>\n0 0 0 0 5 0 5 5 5 0\n"
