    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 7 7 7 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 1 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Transformation:** The sequence of '7's in the input is shifted left to start immediately after the first non-zero number (which is '1').\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 1 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 1 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Transformation:** No change is needed as the sequence of '3's already starts immediately after the first non-zero number.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 1 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n   - **Output:** 1 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0\n   - **Transformation:** The sequence of '7's is shifted left to start immediately after the first non-zero number (which is '1').\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can derive the following rule:\n- Identify the first non-zero number in the input grid.\n- Shift any sequence of identical non-zero numbers (e.g., '7's) to start immediately after this first non-zero number.\n- Fill the remaining positions with zeros.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n- **Test Input:** 1 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **First non-zero number:** 1\n- **Sequence to shift:** '9' (since it's the only non-zero number after the first non-zero number)\n- **Transformation:** Shift '9' to start immediately after '1', resulting in: 1 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThus, the output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<answer>>>\n1 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n"
