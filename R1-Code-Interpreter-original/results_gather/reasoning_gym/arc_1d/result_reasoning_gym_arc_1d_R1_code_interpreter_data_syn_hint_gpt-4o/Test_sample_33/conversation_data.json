    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n#### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 4 4 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 4 4 4 0 4 4 4 0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n#### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 9 9 9 0 0 9 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 9 9 9 0 9 9 9 0 9 9 9 0 9 9 9 0 0 0 0\n\n#### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 5 5 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations:\n1. The first row of the input grid remains unchanged in the output grid.\n2. The second row of the input grid is modified such that the first non-zero element is repeated to fill the row until the first zero appears.\n3. The third row of the input grid is modified similarly to the second row.\n4. The remaining rows are unchanged.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n- For each row in the input grid:\n  - If the row contains non-zero elements, repeat the first non-zero element until the first zero appears.\n  - If the row is entirely zero, it remains unchanged.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\nLet's apply this rule to the test input grid.\n\n#### Test Input:\n- **Input:** 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n\n#### Applying the Rule:\n1. First row: `2 2 2 2 2` remains unchanged.\n2. Second row: `0 0 0 2` becomes `2 2 2 2`.\n3. Third row: `0 0 0 0 0 2` becomes `2 2 2 2 2 2`.\n4. Remaining rows are unchanged.\n\n### Predicted Output:\n- **Output:** 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer.\n\n<<<answer>>>\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0\n"
