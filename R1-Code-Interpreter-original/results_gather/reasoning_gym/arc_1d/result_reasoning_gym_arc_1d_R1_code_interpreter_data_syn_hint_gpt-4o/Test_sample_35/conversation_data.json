    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations:\n1. The output grid always starts with a sequence of zeros, followed by a sequence of the non-zero number from the input, and ends with zeros.\n2. The sequence of the non-zero number in the output grid is shorter than in the input grid.\n3. The non-zero sequence in the output grid starts at the first occurrence of the non-zero number in the input grid and ends at the last occurrence of the non-zero number in the input grid, minus one position.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n- Identify the first and last positions of the non-zero number in the input grid.\n- In the output grid, place the non-zero number starting from the first position to one position before the last position of the non-zero number in the input grid.\n- Fill the rest of the grid with zeros.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- The first occurrence of the non-zero number (3) is at index 2.\n- The last occurrence of the non-zero number (3) is also at index 2.\n- According to the rule, the output should have the non-zero number from index 2 to index 1 (which means no non-zero numbers in the output), and the rest should be zeros.\n\nTherefore, the output grid for the test input is entirely zeros.\n\n<<<answer>>>\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n"
