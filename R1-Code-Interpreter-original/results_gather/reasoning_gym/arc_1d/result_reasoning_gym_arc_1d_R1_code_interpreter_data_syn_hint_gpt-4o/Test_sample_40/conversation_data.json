    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations:\n1. The sequence of 6s in the input is shifted to the left in the output.\n2. The number of 6s remains the same, but their position changes.\n3. The zeros at the beginning and end of the sequence are adjusted to accommodate the shift of 6s.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n- Identify the first and last position of the non-zero sequence (e.g., 6s) in the input.\n- Shift this sequence to the left by a certain number of positions.\n- Fill the remaining positions with zeros.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- The sequence of 3s starts at index 9 and ends at index 15.\n- Shift this sequence to the left by 3 positions (as observed in the examples).\n- Fill the remaining positions with zeros.\n\nLet's apply this rule to generate the output for the test input:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first and last non-zero elements\n    first_non_zero = next((i for i, x in enumerate(input_grid) if x != 0), None)\n    last_non_zero = len(input_grid) - next((i for i, x in enumerate(reversed(input_grid)) if x != 0), None) - 1\n    \n    # Extract the non-zero sequence\n    non_zero_sequence = input_grid[first_non_zero:last_non_zero + 1]\n    \n    # Calculate the shift amount (3 positions to the left)\n    shift_amount = 3\n    \n    # Create the output grid\n    output_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\n    output_grid[shift_amount:shift_amount + len(non_zero_sequence)] = non_zero_sequence\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the output grid for the test input.",
