    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 1 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 1 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0\n\nThe input and output are identical. This suggests that if the sequence is already in the desired form, it remains unchanged.\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 1 0 4 4 4 4 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 1 4 4 4 4 0 0\n\nHere, the sequence \"0 4 4 4 4 0\" is transformed to \"4 4 4 4 0 0\". The '1' remains in its position, and the sequence of '4's is shifted left, filling the space after '1'.\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n- **Output:** 0 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n\nAgain, the input and output are identical, indicating no transformation is needed when the sequence is already in the desired form.\n\n### Observations:\n- The transformation seems to involve shifting a sequence of identical numbers to the left, filling the space after the first non-zero number.\n- The first non-zero number remains in its position.\n- The sequence of identical numbers is shifted left, and the trailing zeros are moved to the end.\n\n### Test Input Analysis:\n- **Input:** 8 8 8 8 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n\nApplying the observed rule:\n1. Identify the first non-zero number, which is '8'.\n2. The sequence of '8's is already at the start, so no shifting is needed.\n3. The '1' is isolated and should be moved to the position after the sequence of '8's.\n\nThus, the output should be:\n- **Output:** 8 8 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe rule is consistent with the examples provided, and the transformation has been applied correctly.\n\n<<<answer>>>\n8 8 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n"
