    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n#### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 8 8 2 2 2 0 0 0 8 8 8 2 2 2 2 0 0 0\n\n#### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 8 2 2 0 0 8 8 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n#### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 8 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 2 2 2\n\n### Observations\n1. The output grid seems to replace some of the '2's with '8's.\n2. The '8's appear at the beginning of sequences of '2's in the input grid.\n3. The number of '8's at the start of a sequence seems to be equal to the number of '2's in the sequence in the input grid.\n\n### Rule Derivation\nFrom the observations, we can derive the following rule:\n- For each contiguous sequence of '2's in the input grid, replace the first '2' with '8' in the output grid. If the sequence has more than one '2', replace the first two '2's with '8's.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid.\n\n#### Test Input:\n- **Input:** 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nLet's break it down:\n- The first sequence of '2's is \"2 2 2 2 2\". According to the rule, we replace the first two '2's with '8's.\n- The second sequence of '2's is \"2 2 2\". We replace the first two '2's with '8's.\n\n#### Predicted Output:\n- **Output:** 8 8 2 2 2 0 0 8 8 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThus, the predicted output grid for the test input is:\n\n<<<answer>>>\n8 8 2 2 2 0 0 8 8 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n"
