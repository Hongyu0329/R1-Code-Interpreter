    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n#### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 6 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 6 6 0 6 6 6 0\n- **Output:** 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0\n\n#### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 6 6 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 6 6 0 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n#### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0\n- **Output:** 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations:\n1. The output grid seems to be a rearrangement of the input grid.\n2. The first few elements of the output grid are non-zero values from the input grid, followed by zeros.\n3. The non-zero values in the output grid appear to be in the same order as they appear in the input grid.\n\n### Hypothesis:\nThe rule seems to be that the output grid is formed by moving all non-zero elements from the input grid to the front, maintaining their order, and filling the rest with zeros.\n\n### Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0 0\n\n### Applying the Rule:\n1. Extract all non-zero elements from the input grid: 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7.\n2. Place them at the beginning of the output grid.\n3. Fill the remaining positions with zeros.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to generate the output grid for the test input.\n\n```python\n# Define the input grid\ninput_grid = [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n# Extract non-zero elements\nnon_zero_elements = [x for x in input_grid if x != 0]\n\n# Calculate the number of zeros needed\nnum_zeros = len(input_grid) - len(non_zero_elements)\n\n# Create the output grid\noutput_grid = non_zero_elements + [0] * num_zeros\n\n# Print the output grid\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nThis code will generate the output grid based on the identified rule. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code execution result shows that the output grid is `[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. This matches the expected pattern based on our hypothesis: moving all non-zero elements to the front and filling the rest with zeros.\n\nThe code correctly implements the rule we derived from the examples. The non-zero elements from the input grid are extracted and placed at the beginning of the output grid, followed by zeros to fill the remaining positions.\n\nSince the code execution result aligns with our expectations and the rule we identified, we can confidently provide the final answer for the test input grid.\n\n<<<answer>>>\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n<<<answer>>>"
