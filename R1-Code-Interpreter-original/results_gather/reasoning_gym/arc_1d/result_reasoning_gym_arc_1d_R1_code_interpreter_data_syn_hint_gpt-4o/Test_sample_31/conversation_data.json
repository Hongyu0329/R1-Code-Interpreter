    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid. Let's analyze the given examples:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 7 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 2 2 2 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 8 0 0\n- **Output:** 8 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0\n\n### Observations:\n1. In each example, the output grid is a rearrangement of the input grid.\n2. The non-zero numbers in the input grid are shifted such that the smallest non-zero number appears first in the output grid.\n3. The rest of the numbers follow in the same order as they appear in the input grid, except the smallest number is moved to the front.\n4. Zeros remain in their positions at the end of the grid.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n- Identify the smallest non-zero number in the input grid.\n- Move this smallest number to the front of the grid.\n- Keep the order of the remaining numbers the same.\n- Ensure zeros remain at the end of the grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 4 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- The smallest non-zero number is 3.\n- Move 3 to the front.\n- The rest of the numbers follow in the same order.\n- Zeros remain at the end.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the smallest non-zero number\n    non_zero_numbers = [num for num in input_grid if num != 0]\n    smallest_number = min(non_zero_numbers)\n    \n    # Create the output grid\n    output_grid = [smallest_number] + [num for num in non_zero_numbers if num != smallest_number] + [0] * (len(input_grid) - len(non_zero_numbers))\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the output grid for the test input.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the output grid is incorrect. The issue arises because the code does not correctly maintain the order of the numbers after moving the smallest non-zero number to the front. Let's refine our approach:\n\n### Corrected Approach:\n1. Identify the smallest non-zero number in the input grid.\n2. Move this smallest number to the front of the grid.\n3. Maintain the order of the remaining numbers as they appear in the input grid.\n4. Ensure zeros remain at the end of the grid.\n\nLet's implement this refined logic in the code:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the smallest non-zero number\n    non_zero_numbers = [num for num in input_grid if num != 0]\n    smallest_number = min(non_zero_numbers)\n    \n    # Create the output grid\n    output_grid = [smallest_number] + [num for num in input_grid if num != 0 and num != smallest_number] + [0] * (len(input_grid) - len(non_zero_numbers))\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ninput_grid = [4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nThis code should correctly transform the input grid according to the identified rule.

    "The previous code attempts did not produce the correct output because they did not maintain the correct order of numbers after moving the smallest non-zero number to the front.
