    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze each example:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 6\n- **Output:** 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 6 6 6\n\nThe transformation here seems to involve shifting the last three elements to the right by one position.\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n- **Output:** 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n\nNo change is observed here, indicating that if the grid is uniform, it remains unchanged.\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n- **Output:** 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n\nHere, the first three elements are shifted to the right by one position, and the last three elements are shifted to the left by one position.\n\n### Deriving the Rule:\nFrom the examples, it seems the rule involves shifting elements based on the presence of zeros:\n- If zeros are present at the end, they are shifted to the right.\n- If zeros are present at the beginning, they are shifted to the left.\n- If the grid is uniform, no change is made.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nFollowing the rule:\n- The zeros at the beginning should be shifted to the left, but since they are already at the start, they remain unchanged.\n- The zeros at the end should be shifted to the right, but since they are already at the end, they remain unchanged.\n\nThus, the output grid should be the same as the input grid.\n\n<<<answer>>>\n0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n"
