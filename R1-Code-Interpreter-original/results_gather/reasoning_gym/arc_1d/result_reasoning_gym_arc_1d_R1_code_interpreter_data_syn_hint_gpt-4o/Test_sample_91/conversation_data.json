    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples one by one:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:**  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 5 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 5 0\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:**  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 7 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 7\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:**  0 0 0 0 6 6 1 3 3 6 9 6 4 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 1 3 3 6 9 6 4 0 0\n\n### Observations:\n1. In each example, the non-zero elements in the input grid are shifted to the right in the output grid.\n2. The number of zeros at the beginning of the output grid increases compared to the input grid.\n3. The non-zero elements maintain their order but are shifted towards the end of the grid.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\nThe rule seems to involve shifting all non-zero elements to the rightmost positions in the grid while maintaining their order. The zeros are filled in the remaining positions at the start of the grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 7 2 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nFollowing the derived rule, we need to:\n1. Identify the non-zero elements: 7, 2, 7\n2. Shift these elements to the rightmost positions in the grid.\n3. Fill the remaining positions with zeros.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to compute the output for the test input.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Extract non-zero elements\n    non_zero_elements = [x for x in input_grid if x != 0]\n    # Calculate the number of leading zeros\n    leading_zeros = len(input_grid) - len(non_zero_elements)\n    # Create the output grid\n    output_grid = [0] * leading_zeros + non_zero_elements\n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [7, 2, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n# Get the output\noutput = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the output grid for the test input.",
    "The code execution result is consistent with the derived rule, which is to shift all non-zero elements to the rightmost positions in the grid while maintaining their order. The zeros are filled in the remaining positions at the start of the grid.\n\nThe output grid for the test input is:\n\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 2 7\n\nThis matches the expected transformation based on the examples provided. Therefore, the rule has been correctly applied.\n\nNow, I will provide the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<answer>>> 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 2 7 <<<answer>>>"
