    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples to find a pattern or rule.\n\n### Analysis of Examples\n\n**Example 1:**\n- Input: 2 0 2 0 0 0 2 2 0 2 1\n- Output: 2 2 2 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0\n\n**Example 2:**\n- Input: 2 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 2 1\n- Output: 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0\n\n**Example 3:**\n- Input: 0 0 0 1 2 0 2 1 0 2 0\n- Output: 2 2 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations\n\n1. **Leading Twos:** In all examples, the output starts with a sequence of '2's. The number of '2's in the output seems to be equal to the number of '2's in the input.\n\n2. **Ones and Zeros:** After the initial sequence of '2's, the output contains '1's followed by '0's. The number of '1's in the output seems to be equal to the number of '1's in the input.\n\n3. **Zeros:** The remaining positions in the output are filled with '0's.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the observations, we can derive the following rule:\n- Count the number of '2's in the input and place that many '2's at the start of the output.\n- Count the number of '1's in the input and place that many '1's immediately after the '2's in the output.\n- Fill the remaining positions in the output with '0's.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n**Test Input:**\n- Input: 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 0 0\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Count the number of '2's: There are 4 '2's.\n2. Count the number of '1's: There are 0 '1's.\n3. Construct the output:\n   - Start with four '2's: 2 2 2 2\n   - Add zero '1's: (no '1's to add)\n   - Fill the rest with '0's: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThus, the output for the test input is: 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n<<<answer>>>\n2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n"
