    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 4 4 4 0 4 4 0 4 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 4 0 4 4 0 4 4 4 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 4 0 4 4 4 0 4 4 4 4 0 4 4 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 4 0 4 4 0 4 4 4 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 0 6 0 6 6 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 6 0 6 6 0 6 6 6 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations\n\n- The output grid seems to be a rearrangement of the input grid.\n- The first element of the output is the same as the first element of the input.\n- The second element of the output is always 0.\n- The third element of the output is the same as the third element of the input.\n- The fourth element of the output is the same as the second element of the input.\n- The fifth element of the output is always 0.\n- The sixth element of the output is the same as the fifth element of the input.\n- The seventh element of the output is the same as the sixth element of the input.\n- The eighth element of the output is the same as the seventh element of the input.\n- The ninth element of the output is always 0.\n- The rest of the elements in the output are the same as the corresponding elements in the input.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the observations, we can derive the following rule for transforming the input grid to the output grid:\n\n1. Copy the first element from the input to the output.\n2. Set the second element of the output to 0.\n3. Copy the third element from the input to the output.\n4. Copy the second element from the input to the fourth position in the output.\n5. Set the fifth element of the output to 0.\n6. Copy the fifth, sixth, and seventh elements from the input to the sixth, seventh, and eighth positions in the output, respectively.\n7. Set the ninth element of the output to 0.\n8. Copy the remaining elements from the input to the output.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n- **Input:** 5 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 0 0 0\n\nFollowing the rule:\n\n1. First element: 5\n2. Second element: 0\n3. Third element: 5\n4. Fourth element: 0 (second element of input)\n5. Fifth element: 0\n6. Sixth element: 5 (fifth element of input)\n7. Seventh element: 0 (sixth element of input)\n8. Eighth element: 5 (seventh element of input)\n9. Ninth element: 0\n10. Remaining elements: 5 0 5 5 0 0 0\n\nThus, the output grid is:\n\n5 0 5 0 0 5 0 5 0 5 0 5 5 0 0 0 0\n\n<<<answer>>>5 0 5 0 0 5 0 5 0 5 0 5 5 0 0 0 0<<<answer>>>"
