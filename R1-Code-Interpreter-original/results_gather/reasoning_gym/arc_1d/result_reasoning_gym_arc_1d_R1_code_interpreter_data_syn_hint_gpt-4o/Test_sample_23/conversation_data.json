    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples:\n\n### Example Analysis\n\n1. **Example 1:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of '2's is shifted left by 4 positions.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** This is identical to Example 1, confirming the left shift by 4 positions.\n\n3. **Example 3:**\n   - **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Output:** 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   - **Observation:** The sequence of '8's is shifted left by 5 positions.\n\n### Rule Derivation\n\nFrom the examples, we can deduce the following rule:\n- Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n- Shift this sequence to the left by a certain number of positions.\n- The number of positions to shift seems to be determined by the position of the first non-zero number in the input grid.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\n**Test Input:**\n- 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Identify the sequence of '7's starting at the 5th position.\n2. Shift this sequence left by 4 positions (since the first '7' is at the 5th position, similar to the pattern observed in the examples).\n\n**Predicted Output:**\n- 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThus, the output grid for the test input, following the derived rule, is:\n\n<<<answer>>>\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n"
