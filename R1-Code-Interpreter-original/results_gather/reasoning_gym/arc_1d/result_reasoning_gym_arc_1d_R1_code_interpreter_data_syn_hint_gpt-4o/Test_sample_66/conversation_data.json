    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps each input grid to its corresponding output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples one by one:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe input and output are identical. No transformation is applied.\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 2 0 0 0 0\n\nAgain, the input and output are identical. No transformation is applied.\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n- **Output:** 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0\n\nIn this case, the sequence of 8s is shifted to the left, and the trailing 8s are replaced with 0s.\n\n### Observations:\n- In Examples 1 and 2, the input and output grids are identical, suggesting no transformation is needed.\n- In Example 3, the sequence of 8s is shifted left, and the trailing 8s are replaced with 0s.\n\n### Hypothesis:\nThe rule seems to be that if there is a sequence of non-zero numbers at the end of the grid, they are shifted left, and the trailing numbers are replaced with 0s. If the sequence is not at the end, no transformation is applied.\n\n### Test Input:\n- **Input:** 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0\n\n### Applying the Rule:\n- The sequence of 4s is at the end of the grid, so it should be shifted left, and the trailing 4s should be replaced with 0s.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input:\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the first non-zero element from the right\n    for i in range(len(input_grid) - 1, -1, -1):\n        if input_grid[i] != 0:\n            break\n    \n    # If the sequence is at the end, shift it left\n    if i == len(input_grid) - 1:\n        return input_grid\n    \n    # Otherwise, shift the sequence left and replace trailing with 0s\n    non_zero_sequence = input_grid[i:]\n    transformed_grid = input_grid[:i] + non_zero_sequence + [0] * (len(input_grid) - len(non_zero_sequence) - i)\n    return transformed_grid\n\ninput_grid = [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0]\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nprint(output_grid)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to find the output grid.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the output grid is identical to the input grid, which suggests that the transformation rule was not correctly applied. Let's revisit the problem and refine our understanding of the transformation rule.\n\n### Re-evaluation of the Rule:\nUpon closer inspection, it seems that the rule involves shifting a sequence of non-zero numbers to the left if they are at the end of the grid, and replacing the trailing numbers with 0s. However, the code did not correctly implement this logic.\n\n### Corrected Approach:\n1. Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers that are at the end of the grid.\n2. Shift this sequence to the left by one position.\n3.

    "The repeated execution of the code with the same result indicates that the transformation logic is not correctly implemented. Let's switch to a more detailed textual reasoning approach to identify the correct transformation rule.\n\n### Detailed Analysis:\n1. **Example 1 and 2**: The input and output grids are identical, indicating no transformation is needed when the sequence of non-zero numbers is not at the end of the grid.\n\n2. **Example 3**: The sequence of 8s is shifted left, and the trailing 8s are replaced with 0s. This suggests that when a sequence of non-zero numbers is at the end of the grid, it should be shifted left, and the trailing numbers should be replaced with 0s.\n\n### Hypothesis:\n- If a sequence of non-zero numbers is at the end of the grid, shift it left by one position and replace the trailing numbers with 0s.\n- If the sequence is not at the end, no transformation is applied.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0\n- The sequence of 4s is at the end of the grid. According to the rule, this sequence should be shifted left, and the trailing numbers should be replaced with 0s.\n\n### Expected Output:\n- Shift the sequence of 4s left by one position.\n- Replace the trailing numbers with 0s.\n\nThe expected output grid should be:\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0\n\nLet's finalize the answer based on this reasoning.\n\n<<<answer>>>\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0\n<<<answer>>>"
