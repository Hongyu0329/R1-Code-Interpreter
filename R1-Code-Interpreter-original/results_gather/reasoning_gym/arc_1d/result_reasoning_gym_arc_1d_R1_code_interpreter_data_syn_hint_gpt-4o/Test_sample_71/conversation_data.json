    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the transformation rule that maps the input grid to the output grid based on the given examples. Let's analyze the examples one by one:\n\n### Example 1:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 6 6 6 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Example 2:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Example 3:\n- **Input:** 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 9\n- **Output:** 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n### Observations:\n1. In each example, the number '2' remains in the same position in both the input and output grids.\n2. The sequence of non-zero numbers (other than '2') in the input grid is shifted to a different position in the output grid.\n3. The sequence of numbers is shifted to the left in the output grid, but the exact position varies.\n\n### Rule Derivation:\n- Identify the position of '2' in the input grid.\n- Identify the sequence of non-zero numbers (other than '2') in the input grid.\n- Shift this sequence to the left in the output grid, ensuring that '2' remains in its original position.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** 0 0 0 0 2 0 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n- The position of '2' is at index 4.\n- The sequence of non-zero numbers (other than '2') is '7 7 7'.\n- Shift '7 7 7' to the left, ensuring '2' remains at index 4.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to determine the output grid for the test input.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the position of '2'\n    pos_2 = input_grid.index(2)\n    \n    # Extract the sequence of non-zero numbers other than '2'\n    sequence = [x for x in input_grid if x != 0 and x != 2]\n    \n    # Create the output grid initialized with zeros\n    output_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\n    \n    # Place '2' in its original position\n    output_grid[pos_2] = 2\n    \n    # Place the sequence in the output grid, shifted to the left\n    for i, num in enumerate(sequence):\n        output_grid[i] = num\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n# Get the output\noutput = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the output grid for the test input.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the transformation rule applied was incorrect. The output grid does not match the expected pattern based on the examples provided. Let's revisit the problem and refine our approach.\n\n### Re-evaluating the Rule:\nUpon closer inspection of the examples, it seems that the sequence of non-zero numbers (other than '2') is not simply shifted to the left. Instead, it appears that the sequence is moved to a specific position in the output grid, which may depend on the position of '2' or other factors.\n\n### Observations:\n1. In Example 1, the sequence '6 6 6' is moved to start at index 5 in the output.\n2. In Example 2, the sequence '4 4' is moved to start at index 8 in the output.\n3. In Example 3, the number '9' is moved to start at index 3 in the output.\n\n### Hypothesis:\nThe sequence of non-zero numbers (other than '2') is moved to a position such that it is as far left as possible without overlapping with '2'. This means we need to find the first available position from the left where the sequence can fit without disturbing the position of '2'.\n\n### Revised Approach:\n1. Identify the position of '2' in the input grid.\n2. Extract the sequence of non-zero numbers (other than '2').\n3. Determine the first available position from the left where the sequence can fit without overlapping with '2'.\n4. Place the sequence in the output grid starting from this position.\n\nLet's implement this revised logic in Python.\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Find the position of '2'\n    pos_2 = input_grid.index(2)\n    \n    # Extract the sequence of non-zero numbers other than '2'\n    sequence = [x for x in input_grid if x != 0 and x != 2]\n    \n    # Create the output grid initialized with zeros\n    output_grid = [0] * len(input_grid)\n    \n    # Place '2' in its original position\n    output_grid[pos_2] = 2\n    \n    # Determine the first available position for the sequence\n    # It should be as far left as possible without overlapping with '2'\n    start_pos = 0\n    while start_pos + len(sequence) > pos_2:\n        start_pos += 1\n    \n    # Place the sequence in the output grid\n    for i, num in enumerate(sequence):\n        output_grid[start_pos + i] = num\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Test input\ntest_input = [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n# Get the output\noutput = transform_grid(test_input)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will provide the correct output grid for the test input.",
