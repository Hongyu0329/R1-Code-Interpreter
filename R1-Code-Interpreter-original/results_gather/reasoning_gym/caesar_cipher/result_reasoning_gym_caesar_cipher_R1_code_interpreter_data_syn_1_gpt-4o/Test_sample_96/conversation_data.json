    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. A Caesar cipher shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of places down the alphabet. The most common shift used is 3, but it could be any number.\n\nThe given text is: \"FVE QB ABG PBHAG BA ZR SBE URYC.\"\n\nLet's try a shift of 13, which is often used in ROT13, a special case of the Caesar cipher where the shift is 13. This is a common shift used in puzzles and simple encryption.\n\nWe'll write a Python script to apply a shift of 13 to the given text and see if it results in a meaningful message.\n\n```python\ndef caesar_decrypt(ciphertext, shift):\n    decrypted_text = []\n    for char in ciphertext:\n        if char.isalpha():\n            shift_amount = shift % 26\n            shifted = ord(char) - shift_amount\n            if char.isupper():\n                if shifted < ord('A'):\n                    shifted += 26\n            elif char.islower():\n                if shifted < ord('a'):\n                    shifted += 26\n            decrypted_text.append(chr(shifted))\n        else:\n            decrypted_text.append(char)\n    return ''.join(decrypted_text)\n\nciphertext = \"FVE QB ABG PBHAG BA ZR SBE URYC\"\nshift = 13\ndecrypted_message = caesar_decrypt(ciphertext, shift)\nprint(decrypted_message)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to see the decrypted message.",
    "The decrypted message from the Caesar cipher with a shift of 13 is \"SIR DO NOT COUNT ON ME FOR HELP.\"\n\n<<<SIR DO NOT COUNT ON ME FOR HELP>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Decrypt this Caesar cipher text: FVE QB ABG PBHAG BA ZR SBE URYC.
