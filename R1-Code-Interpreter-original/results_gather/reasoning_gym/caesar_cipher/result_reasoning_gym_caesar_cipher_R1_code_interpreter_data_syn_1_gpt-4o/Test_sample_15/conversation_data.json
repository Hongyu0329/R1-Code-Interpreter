    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.\n\nGiven the text: \"KLV VSHFLDO SURMHFW KDG WR GR ZLWK WKH FLWB RI DV HYHUBERGB VRPH ILIWHHQ PLOHV LQODQG.\"\n\nWe will try to decrypt it by shifting the letters back by a certain number of positions. The most common shift used in Caesar ciphers is 3, but we will try all possible shifts from 1 to 25 to find the one that results in a meaningful English sentence.\n\nLet's write a Python script to try all possible shifts and print the results.\n\n```python\ndef caesar_decrypt(ciphertext, shift):\n    decrypted_text = []\n    for char in ciphertext:\n        if char.isalpha():\n            shift_amount = shift\n            if char.isupper():\n                start = ord('A')\n            else:\n                start = ord('a')\n            decrypted_char = chr((ord(char) - start - shift_amount) % 26 + start)\n            decrypted_text.append(decrypted_char)\n        else:\n            decrypted_text.append(char)\n    return ''.join(decrypted_text)\n\nciphertext = \"KLV VSHFLDO SURMHFW KDG WR GR ZLWK WKH FLWB RI DV HYHUBERGB VRPH ILIWHHQ PLOHV LQODQG.\"\n\nfor shift in range(1, 26):\n    decrypted = caesar_decrypt(ciphertext, shift)\n    print(f\"Shift {shift}: {decrypted}\")\n```\n\nThis script will try all possible shifts and print the decrypted text for each shift. Let's execute the code to find the correct decryption.",
    "The code output shows the decrypted text for each shift from 1 to 11. The correct decryption appears at Shift 3:\n\n\"HIS SPECIAL PROJECT HAD TO DO WITH THE CITY OF AS EVERYBODY SOME FIFTEEN MILES INLAND.\"\n\nThis is a meaningful English sentence, indicating that the shift used in the original Caesar cipher was 3.\n\n<<<HIS SPECIAL PROJECT HAD TO DO WITH THE CITY OF AS EVERYBODY SOME FIFTEEN MILES INLAND.>>>"
