    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.\n\nGiven the text: \"QRB RAXW LXWBCRCDCRXW RB CJGNM CX CQN DCVXBC KH CQN QNJEH BCAJRW CQJC RB YDC DYXW RC.\"\n\nWe will try different shifts from 1 to 25 (since a shift of 0 would result in the same text) and check which one results in a meaningful English sentence. \n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this process:\n\n```python\ndef caesar_decrypt(ciphertext, shift):\n    decrypted_text = []\n    for char in ciphertext:\n        if char.isalpha():\n            shifted = ord(char) - shift\n            if char.isupper():\n                if shifted < ord('A'):\n                    shifted += 26\n                decrypted_text.append(chr(shifted))\n            else:\n                if shifted < ord('a'):\n                    shifted += 26\n                decrypted_text.append(chr(shifted))\n        else:\n            decrypted_text.append(char)\n    return ''.join(decrypted_text)\n\nciphertext = \"QRB RAXW LXWBCRCDCRXW RB CJGNM CX CQN DCVXBC KH CQN QNJEH BCAJRW CQJC RB YDC DYXW RC.\"\n\nfor shift in range(1, 26):\n    decrypted_text = caesar_decrypt(ciphertext, shift)\n    print(f\"Shift {shift}: {decrypted_text}\")\n```\n\nThis script will try all possible shifts and print the resulting decrypted text for each shift. We will look for the shift that results in a coherent English sentence.",
    "The output from the code execution shows the decrypted text for each shift. We are looking for a coherent English sentence among these outputs. \n\nFrom the output, the decrypted text for Shift 9 is:\n\n\"Shift 9: HIS IRON CONSTITUTION IS TAXED TO THE UTMOST BY THE HEAVY STRAIN THAT IS PUT UPON IT.\"\n\nThis is a coherent English sentence, indicating that the correct shift for decrypting the Caesar cipher is 9.\n\n<<<HIS IRON CONSTITUTION IS TAXED TO THE UTMOST BY THE HEAVY STRAIN THAT IS PUT UPON IT.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
