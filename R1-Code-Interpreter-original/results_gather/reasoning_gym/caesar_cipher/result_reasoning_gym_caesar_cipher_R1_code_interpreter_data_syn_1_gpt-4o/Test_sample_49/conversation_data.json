    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift value used for encryption. The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.\n\nThe text \"HBXIW ID SG\" seems to be encrypted with a Caesar cipher. We will try all possible shifts (1 through 25) to find the one that results in a meaningful English phrase.\n\nLet's write a Python script to try all possible shifts and print the results. We will look for a shift that results in a coherent English sentence.\n\n```python\ndef caesar_decrypt(ciphertext, shift):\n    decrypted_text = []\n    for char in ciphertext:\n        if char.isalpha():\n            shift_amount = shift % 26\n            shifted = ord(char) - shift_amount\n            if char.isupper():\n                if shifted < ord('A'):\n                    shifted += 26\n            elif char.islower():\n                if shifted < ord('a'):\n                    shifted += 26\n            decrypted_text.append(chr(shifted))\n        else:\n            decrypted_text.append(char)\n    return ''.join(decrypted_text)\n\nciphertext = \"HBXIW ID SG\"\nfor shift in range(1, 26):\n    decrypted = caesar_decrypt(ciphertext, shift)\n    print(f\"Shift {shift}: {decrypted}\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the correct shift and the decrypted message.",
    "The output of the code shows the decrypted text for each possible shift. Among these, the shift that results in a coherent English phrase is shift 15, which gives us \"SMITH TO DR\".\n\nTherefore, the decrypted text is:\n\n<<<SMITH TO DR>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
