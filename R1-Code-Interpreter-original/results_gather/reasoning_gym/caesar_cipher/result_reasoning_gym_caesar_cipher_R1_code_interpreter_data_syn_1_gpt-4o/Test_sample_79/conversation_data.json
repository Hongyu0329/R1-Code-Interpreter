    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.\n\nGiven the text: \"ESP LEEPYETZY ZQ ESP NSTYPDP RZGPCYXPYE DSLWW MP NLWWPO EZ ESP XLEEPC\", we need to find the shift value that was used to encrypt this text.\n\nThe most common letter in the English language is 'E'. In the encrypted text, the most frequent letter is 'E', which suggests that the shift might be 0, but this is unlikely since the text is not readable. We should try other possible shifts.\n\nTo efficiently find the correct shift, we can write a Python script to try all possible shifts (from 1 to 25) and see which one results in a readable text.\n\n```python\ndef decrypt_caesar_cipher(text, shift):\n    decrypted_text = []\n    for char in text:\n        if char.isalpha():\n            shifted = ord(char) - shift\n            if char.isupper():\n                if shifted < ord('A'):\n                    shifted += 26\n            elif char.islower():\n                if shifted < ord('a'):\n                    shifted += 26\n            decrypted_text.append(chr(shifted))\n        else:\n            decrypted_text.append(char)\n    return ''.join(decrypted_text)\n\ncipher_text = \"ESP LEEPYETZY ZQ ESP NSTYPDP RZGPCYXPYE DSLWW MP NLWWPO EZ ESP XLEEPC\"\n\nfor shift in range(1, 26):\n    decrypted = decrypt_caesar_cipher(cipher_text, shift)\n    print(f\"Shift {shift}: {decrypted}\")\n```\n\nThis script will try all possible shifts and print the resulting decrypted text for each shift. We can then identify which shift results in a meaningful English sentence.",
    "The output from the code execution shows the decrypted text for each possible shift. The correct shift is found when the decrypted text forms a coherent English sentence. \n\nFrom the output, we can see that with a shift of 11, the text reads:\n\n\"THE ATTENTION OF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT SHALL BE CALLED TO THE MATTER\"\n\nThis is a meaningful English sentence, indicating that the correct shift for decrypting the Caesar cipher is 11.\n\n<<<THE ATTENTION OF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT SHALL BE CALLED TO THE MATTER>>>"
