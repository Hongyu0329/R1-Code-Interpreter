    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift value used in the encryption. A Caesar cipher shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of places down the alphabet. The challenge is to find the correct shift value that was used to encrypt the text.\n\nThe given text is: \"BOE BOZ BEEJUJPOBM UFSNT JNQPTFE CZ UIF DPQZSJHIU IPMEFS.\"\n\nA common approach to decrypting a Caesar cipher without knowing the shift is to try all possible shifts (from 1 to 25) and see which one results in a meaningful message. Since the Caesar cipher is a simple substitution cipher, this brute-force method is feasible.\n\nLet's write a Python script to try all possible shifts and print the results. We will look for the shift that results in a coherent English sentence.\n\n```python\ndef decrypt_caesar_cipher(text, shift):\n    decrypted_text = []\n    for char in text:\n        if char.isalpha():\n            shift_amount = shift\n            if char.isupper():\n                start = ord('A')\n            else:\n                start = ord('a')\n            decrypted_char = chr((ord(char) - start - shift_amount) % 26 + start)\n            decrypted_text.append(decrypted_char)\n        else:\n            decrypted_text.append(char)\n    return ''.join(decrypted_text)\n\ncipher_text = \"BOE BOZ BEEJUJPOBM UFSNT JNQPTFE CZ UIF DPQZSJHIU IPMEFS.\"\n\n# Try all possible shifts\nfor shift in range(1, 26):\n    decrypted = decrypt_caesar_cipher(cipher_text, shift)\n    print(f\"Shift {shift}: {decrypted}\")\n```\n\nThis script will output the decrypted text for each possible shift. We will look for the shift that results in a meaningful English sentence.",
    "The output from the code execution shows the decrypted text for each possible shift. We are looking for a shift that results in a coherent English sentence. \n\nFrom the output, the text decrypted with a shift of 1 is:\n\n\"AND ANY ADDITIONAL TERMS IMPOSED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER.\"\n\nThis is a meaningful English sentence, indicating that the correct shift value is 1.\n\nTherefore, the decrypted text is:\n\n<<<AND ANY ADDITIONAL TERMS IMPOSED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Decrypt this Caesar cipher text: BOE BOZ BEEJUJPOBM UFSNT JNQPTFE CZ UIF DPQZSJHIU IPMEFS.
