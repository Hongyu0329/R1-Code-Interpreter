    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet. \n\nGiven the text \"WMS KSQR AMKC YLB QCC\", we need to try different shifts to find the one that results in a meaningful English sentence. The most common shift used in Caesar ciphers is 3, but it could be any number from 1 to 25.\n\nLet's write a Python script to try all possible shifts and print the results. We will look for the shift that results in a coherent English sentence.\n\n```python\ndef decrypt_caesar_cipher(text, shift):\n    decrypted_text = []\n    for char in text:\n        if char.isalpha():\n            shifted = ord(char) - shift\n            if char.isupper():\n                if shifted < ord('A'):\n                    shifted += 26\n            elif char.islower():\n                if shifted < ord('a'):\n                    shifted += 26\n            decrypted_text.append(chr(shifted))\n        else:\n            decrypted_text.append(char)\n    return ''.join(decrypted_text)\n\ncipher_text = \"WMS KSQR AMKC YLB QCC\"\nfor shift in range(1, 26):\n    decrypted = decrypt_caesar_cipher(cipher_text, shift)\n    print(f\"Shift {shift}: {decrypted}\")\n```\n\nThis script will try all possible shifts from 1 to 25 and print the resulting text for each shift. We will look for the shift that results in a meaningful sentence.",
    "The output from the code execution shows the decrypted text for each possible shift. Among these, the shift that results in a coherent English sentence is shift 24, which gives us the text \"YOU MUST COME AND SEE\".\n\nTherefore, the decrypted text is:\n\n<<<YOU MUST COME AND SEE>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Decrypt this Caesar cipher text: WMS KSQR AMKC YLB QCC.
