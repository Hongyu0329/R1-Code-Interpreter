    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet. \n\nIn this case, we have the encrypted text \"DRO CKSN WB\". A common approach is to try all possible shifts (from 1 to 25) and see which one results in a meaningful message. \n\nLet's write a Python script to try all possible shifts and print the results. We will look for the shift that results in a coherent English sentence.\n\n```python\ndef decrypt_caesar_cipher(text, shift):\n    decrypted_text = []\n    for char in text:\n        if char.isalpha():\n            shifted = ord(char) - shift\n            if char.isupper():\n                if shifted < ord('A'):\n                    shifted += 26\n            elif char.islower():\n                if shifted < ord('a'):\n                    shifted += 26\n            decrypted_text.append(chr(shifted))\n        else:\n            decrypted_text.append(char)\n    return ''.join(decrypted_text)\n\nencrypted_text = \"DRO CKSN WB\"\nfor shift in range(1, 26):\n    decrypted_text = decrypt_caesar_cipher(encrypted_text, shift)\n    print(f\"Shift {shift}: {decrypted_text}\")\n```\n\nThis script will try all possible shifts and print the decrypted text for each shift. We will then identify the correct shift by looking for a meaningful English sentence.",
    "The output of the code shows the decrypted text for each possible shift. We are looking for a meaningful English sentence among these outputs. \n\nFrom the results, the text \"THE SAID MR\" appears when the shift is 10. This seems to be the most coherent and meaningful English phrase among the options.\n\nTherefore, the decrypted text is:\n\n<<<THE SAID MR>>>"
