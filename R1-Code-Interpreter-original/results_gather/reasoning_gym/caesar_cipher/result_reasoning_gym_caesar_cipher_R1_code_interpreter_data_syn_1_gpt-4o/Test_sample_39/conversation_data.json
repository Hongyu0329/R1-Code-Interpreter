    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. A Caesar cipher shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of places down the alphabet. The challenge is to find the correct shift that was used to encrypt the message.\n\nThe encrypted text is \"KF KYZJ NFIB DI\". We will try different shifts from 1 to 25 (since a shift of 0 would result in the same text) and see which one results in a meaningful message.\n\nLet's write a Python script to try all possible shifts and print the decrypted text for each shift. We will look for a shift that results in a coherent English sentence.\n\n```python\ndef decrypt_caesar_cipher(text, shift):\n    decrypted_text = []\n    for char in text:\n        if char.isalpha():\n            shift_amount = shift % 26\n            shifted = ord(char) - shift_amount\n            if char.isupper():\n                if shifted < ord('A'):\n                    shifted += 26\n            elif char.islower():\n                if shifted < ord('a'):\n                    shifted += 26\n            decrypted_text.append(chr(shifted))\n        else:\n            decrypted_text.append(char)\n    return ''.join(decrypted_text)\n\nencrypted_text = \"KF KYZJ NFIB DI\"\nfor shift in range(1, 26):\n    decrypted_text = decrypt_caesar_cipher(encrypted_text, shift)\n    print(f\"Shift {shift}: {decrypted_text}\")\n```\n\nThis script will output the decrypted text for each possible shift, and we can identify the correct decryption by looking for a meaningful sentence.",
    "The output from the code shows the decrypted text for each possible shift. We are looking for a meaningful English sentence among these outputs. \n\nFrom the results, the decrypted text for shift 17 is \"TO THIS WORK MR\", which is a coherent English sentence. \n\nTherefore, the decrypted text is:\n\n<<<TO THIS WORK MR>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
