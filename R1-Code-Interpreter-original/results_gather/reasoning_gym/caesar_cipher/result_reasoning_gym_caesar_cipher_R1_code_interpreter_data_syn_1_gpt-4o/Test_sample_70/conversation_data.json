    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.\n\nGiven the text \"PDA YKIEJC KB IN\", we need to find the shift value that was used to encrypt it. A common approach is to try all possible shifts (from 1 to 25) and see which one results in a meaningful message.\n\nLet's write a Python script to try all possible shifts and print the decrypted text for each shift. We will then look for the shift that results in a coherent English sentence.\n\n```python\ndef decrypt_caesar_cipher(text, shift):\n    decrypted_text = []\n    for char in text:\n        if char.isalpha():\n            shift_amount = 65 if char.isupper() else 97\n            decrypted_text.append(chr((ord(char) - shift_amount - shift) % 26 + shift_amount))\n        else:\n            decrypted_text.append(char)\n    return ''.join(decrypted_text)\n\ncipher_text = \"PDA YKIEJC KB IN\"\nfor shift in range(1, 26):\n    print(f\"Shift {shift}: {decrypt_caesar_cipher(cipher_text, shift)}\")\n```\n\nThis script will output the decrypted text for each possible shift, allowing us to identify the correct decryption.",
    "The output of the code shows the decrypted text for each possible shift. We are looking for a shift that results in a coherent English sentence. \n\nFrom the output, we can see that with a shift of 22, the text \"THE COMING OF MR\" is a meaningful English sentence.\n\nTherefore, the decrypted text is:\n\n<<<THE COMING OF MR>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
