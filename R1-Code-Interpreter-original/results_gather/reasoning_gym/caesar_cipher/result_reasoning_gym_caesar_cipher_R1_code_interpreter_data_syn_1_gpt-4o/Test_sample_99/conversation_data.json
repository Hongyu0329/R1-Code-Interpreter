    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.\n\nGiven the text: \"TUE HUEUF FA FTQ IADWE FAAW YADQ FUYQ FTMZ TQ TMP MZFUOUBMFQP\", we need to find the correct shift to decrypt it.\n\nThe most common approach is to try all possible shifts (from 1 to 25) and see which one results in a meaningful English sentence. We can automate this process using a Python script.\n\nLet's write a Python script to try all possible shifts and print the results:\n\n```python\ndef decrypt_caesar_cipher(text, shift):\n    decrypted_text = []\n    for char in text:\n        if char.isalpha():\n            shift_amount = shift if char.isupper() else shift\n            new_char = chr((ord(char) - shift_amount - 65) % 26 + 65)\n            decrypted_text.append(new_char)\n        else:\n            decrypted_text.append(char)\n    return ''.join(decrypted_text)\n\ncipher_text = \"TUE HUEUF FA FTQ IADWE FAAW YADQ FUYQ FTMZ TQ TMP MZFUOUBMFQP\"\n\nfor shift in range(1, 26):\n    print(f\"Shift {shift}: {decrypt_caesar_cipher(cipher_text, shift)}\")\n```\n\nThis script will try all possible shifts and print the decrypted text for each shift. Let's execute the code to find the correct decryption.",
    "The output from the code execution shows the decrypted text for each possible shift. The meaningful English sentence appears at Shift 12:\n\n\"Shift 12: HIS VISIT TO THE WORKS TOOK MORE TIME THAN HE HAD ANTICIPATED\"\n\nThis indicates that the original text was encrypted with a shift of 12.\n\nTherefore, the decrypted text is:\n\n<<<HIS VISIT TO THE WORKS TOOK MORE TIME THAN HE HAD ANTICIPATED>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Decrypt this Caesar cipher text: TUE HUEUF FA FTQ IADWE FAAW YADQ FUYQ FTMZ TQ TMP MZFUOUBMFQP.
