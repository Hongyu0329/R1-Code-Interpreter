    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. A Caesar cipher shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of places down the alphabet. Since the shift is not provided, we will try all possible shifts (1 through 25) and check which one results in a meaningful English sentence.\n\nThe text \"TBJO MVY AOHA LEWLYPTLUA\" is in uppercase, so we will maintain the case during decryption. We will iterate through each possible shift, decrypt the text, and check the result.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this process:\n\n```python\ndef caesar_decrypt(ciphertext, shift):\n    decrypted_text = []\n    for char in ciphertext:\n        if char.isalpha():\n            shifted = ord(char) - shift\n            if char.isupper():\n                if shifted < ord('A'):\n                    shifted += 26\n            decrypted_text.append(chr(shifted))\n        else:\n            decrypted_text.append(char)\n    return ''.join(decrypted_text)\n\nciphertext = \"TBJO MVY AOHA LEWLYPTLUA\"\nfor shift in range(1, 26):\n    decrypted_text = caesar_decrypt(ciphertext, shift)\n    print(f\"Shift {shift}: {decrypted_text}\")\n```\n\nThis script will try all possible shifts and print the decrypted text for each shift. Let's execute the code to find the correct decryption.",
    "The output from the code execution shows the decrypted text for each possible shift. We are looking for a meaningful English sentence, which appears to be:\n\nShift 7: MUCH FOR THAT EXPERIMENT\n\nThis indicates that the original text was encrypted with a shift of 7. Therefore, the decrypted text is \"MUCH FOR THAT EXPERIMENT\".\n\n<<<MUCH FOR THAT EXPERIMENT>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Decrypt this Caesar cipher text: TBJO MVY AOHA LEWLYPTLUA.
