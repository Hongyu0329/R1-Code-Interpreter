    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. A Caesar cipher shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of places down the alphabet. The challenge is to find the correct shift that was used to encrypt the message.\n\nThe text \"CWSDR MYXDSXEOC RSC BYEXN KXN OXDOBC DRO RKVV\" appears to be encrypted with a Caesar cipher. To decrypt it, we can try all possible shifts (from 1 to 25) and see which one results in a meaningful message.\n\nLet's write a Python script to try all possible shifts and print the decrypted text for each shift. This will help us identify the correct shift and the original message.\n\n```python\ndef caesar_decrypt(ciphertext, shift):\n    decrypted_text = []\n    for char in ciphertext:\n        if char.isalpha():\n            shifted = ord(char) - shift\n            if char.isupper():\n                if shifted < ord('A'):\n                    shifted += 26\n                decrypted_text.append(chr(shifted))\n            elif char.islower():\n                if shifted < ord('a'):\n                    shifted += 26\n                decrypted_text.append(chr(shifted))\n        else:\n            decrypted_text.append(char)\n    return ''.join(decrypted_text)\n\nciphertext = \"CWSDR MYXDSXEOC RSC BYEXN KXN OXDOBC DRO RKVV\"\nfor shift in range(1, 26):\n    print(f\"Shift {shift}: {caesar_decrypt(ciphertext, shift)}\")\n```\n\nThis script will output the decrypted text for each possible shift, allowing us to identify the correct decryption. Let's execute the code to find the correct shift and the decrypted message.",
    "The output from the code execution shows the decrypted text for each possible shift. By examining the results, we can identify the correct shift that results in a meaningful message.\n\nThe decrypted text for \"Shift 10\" is \"SMITH CONTINUES HIS ROUND AND ENTERS THE HALL,\" which is a coherent and meaningful sentence. Therefore, the correct shift used in the Caesar cipher is 10.\n\nThus, the decrypted text is:\n\n<<<SMITH CONTINUES HIS ROUND AND ENTERS THE HALL>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Decrypt this Caesar cipher text: CWSDR MYXDSXEOC RSC BYEXN KXN OXDOBC DRO RKVV.
