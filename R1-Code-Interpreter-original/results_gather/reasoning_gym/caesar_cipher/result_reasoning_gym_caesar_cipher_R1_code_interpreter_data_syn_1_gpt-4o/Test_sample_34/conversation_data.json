    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. A Caesar cipher shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of places down the alphabet. The challenge is to find the correct shift value that was used to encrypt the text.\n\nThe given text is: \"CWSDR NYOC SC DY MYXXOMD RSC DRO GSBOC YP GRSMR MYWWEXSMKDO GSDR RSC ZKBSC WKXCSYX.\"\n\nTo decrypt this, we can try all possible shifts (from 1 to 25) and see which one results in a meaningful English sentence. This is a brute-force approach, but it is feasible given the limited number of possibilities.\n\nLet's write a Python script to try all possible shifts and print the results. We will look for the shift that results in a coherent English sentence.\n\n```python\ndef caesar_decrypt(ciphertext, shift):\n    decrypted_text = []\n    for char in ciphertext:\n        if char.isalpha():\n            shift_amount = shift\n            if char.isupper():\n                start = ord('A')\n            else:\n                start = ord('a')\n            decrypted_char = chr(start + (ord(char) - start - shift_amount) % 26)\n            decrypted_text.append(decrypted_char)\n        else:\n            decrypted_text.append(char)\n    return ''.join(decrypted_text)\n\nciphertext = \"CWSDR NYOC SC DY MYXXOMD RSC DRO GSBOC YP GRSMR MYWWEXSMKDO GSDR RSC ZKBSC WKXCSYX.\"\n\n# Try all possible shifts\nfor shift in range(1, 26):\n    decrypted_text = caesar_decrypt(ciphertext, shift)\n    print(f\"Shift {shift}: {decrypted_text}\")\n```\n\nThis script will output the decrypted text for each possible shift. We will look for the shift that results in a meaningful sentence.",
    "The output from the code execution shows that the decrypted text with a shift of 10 is a coherent English sentence:\n\n\"SMITH DOES IS TO CONNECT HIS THE WIRES OF WHICH COMMUNICATE WITH HIS PARIS MANSION.\"\n\nThis indicates that the correct shift for decrypting the Caesar cipher text is 10.\n\n<<<SMITH DOES IS TO CONNECT HIS THE WIRES OF WHICH COMMUNICATE WITH HIS PARIS MANSION.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Decrypt this Caesar cipher text: CWSDR NYOC SC DY MYXXOMD RSC DRO GSBOC YP GRSMR MYWWEXSMKDO GSDR RSC ZKBSC WKXCSYX.
