    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet. \n\nGiven the text \"WDL ADCV WPH WT QTTC SG\", we need to try different shifts to find the one that results in a meaningful English sentence. The most common shift used in Caesar ciphers is 3, but it could be any number from 1 to 25.\n\nLet's write a Python script to try all possible shifts and print the results. This will help us identify the correct decryption.\n\n```python\ndef caesar_decrypt(ciphertext, shift):\n    decrypted_text = []\n    for char in ciphertext:\n        if char.isalpha():\n            shift_amount = shift if char.isupper() else shift\n            new_char = chr((ord(char) - shift_amount - 65) % 26 + 65)\n            decrypted_text.append(new_char)\n        else:\n            decrypted_text.append(char)\n    return ''.join(decrypted_text)\n\nciphertext = \"WDL ADCV WPH WT QTTC SG\"\nfor shift in range(1, 26):\n    print(f\"Shift {shift}: {caesar_decrypt(ciphertext, shift)}\")\n```\n\nThis script will try all possible shifts from 1 to 25 and print the resulting text for each shift. By examining the output, we can identify the correct decryption.",
    "By examining the output of the code, we can identify the correct decryption. The meaningful English sentence appears at Shift 15:\n\n\"HOW LONG HAS HE BEEN DR\"\n\nTherefore, the decrypted text is:\n\n<<<HOW LONG HAS HE BEEN DR>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Decrypt this Caesar cipher text: WDL ADCV WPH WT QTTC SG.
