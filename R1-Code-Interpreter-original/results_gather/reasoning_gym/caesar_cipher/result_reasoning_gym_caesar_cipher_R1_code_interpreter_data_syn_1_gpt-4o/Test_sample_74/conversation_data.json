    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. The text provided seems to be shifted by one position forward in the alphabet. This is a common shift used in simple Caesar ciphers.\n\nLet's break down the process:\n\n1. Identify the shift: In this case, it appears to be a shift of +1, meaning each letter in the text is shifted one position forward in the alphabet.\n2. Decrypt the text: To decrypt, we need to shift each letter one position backward.\n\nLet's write a Python script to automate this decryption process.\n\n```python\ndef decrypt_caesar_cipher(text, shift):\n    decrypted_text = []\n    for char in text:\n        if char.isalpha():\n            shifted = ord(char) - shift\n            if char.isupper():\n                if shifted < ord('A'):\n                    shifted += 26\n            elif char.islower():\n                if shifted < ord('a'):\n                    shifted += 26\n            decrypted_text.append(chr(shifted))\n        else:\n            decrypted_text.append(char)\n    return ''.join(decrypted_text)\n\ncipher_text = \"UIF DBTLFU CFJOH MBJE EPXO JO UIF NJEEMF PG UIF UIF UFMFQIPUF XBT HPU JO SFBEJOFTT.\"\nshift = 1\ndecrypted_text = decrypt_caesar_cipher(cipher_text, shift)\nprint(decrypted_text)\n```\n\nThis script will decrypt the given text by shifting each letter one position backward. Let's execute the code to get the decrypted text.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the decrypted text is obtained. The text was shifted by one position forward, and the decryption process shifted it back by one position to reveal the original message.\n\nThe decrypted text is:\n\n<<<THE CASKET BEING LAID DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE THE TELEPHOTE WAS GOT IN READINESS.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
