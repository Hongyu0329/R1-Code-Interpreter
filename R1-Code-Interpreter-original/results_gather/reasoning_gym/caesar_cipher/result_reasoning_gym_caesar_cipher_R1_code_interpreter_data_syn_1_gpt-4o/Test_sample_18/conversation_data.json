    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. A Caesar cipher shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of places down the alphabet. Since the text is in English, we can try all possible shifts (1 to 25) and see which one results in a meaningful sentence.\n\nLet's write a Python script to try all possible shifts and print the results. We will look for the shift that results in a coherent English sentence.\n\n```python\ndef decrypt_caesar_cipher(ciphertext, shift):\n    decrypted_text = []\n    for char in ciphertext:\n        if char.isalpha():\n            shift_amount = shift if char.isupper() else shift\n            new_char = chr((ord(char) - shift_amount - 65) % 26 + 65)\n            decrypted_text.append(new_char)\n        else:\n            decrypted_text.append(char)\n    return ''.join(decrypted_text)\n\nciphertext = \"QXF UXWP QJB QN KNNW MA\"\nfor shift in range(1, 26):\n    decrypted_text = decrypt_caesar_cipher(ciphertext, shift)\n    print(f\"Shift {shift}: {decrypted_text}\")\n```\n\nThis script will try all possible shifts and print the decrypted text for each shift. We will look for the shift that results in a meaningful sentence.",
    "The output of the code shows the decrypted text for each possible shift. We are looking for a shift that results in a coherent English sentence. \n\nFrom the output, the text \"HOW LONG HAS HE BEEN DR\" with shift 9 appears to be the most coherent and meaningful sentence. It seems like the sentence might be incomplete, but it is the most understandable result among the options.\n\nTherefore, the decrypted text is:\n\n<<<HOW LONG HAS HE BEEN DR>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Decrypt this Caesar cipher text: QXF UXWP QJB QN KNNW MA.
