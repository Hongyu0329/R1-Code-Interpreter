    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. A Caesar cipher shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of places down the alphabet. The challenge is to find the correct shift value that was used to encrypt the message.\n\nThe text \"FK QTL ELROP JO\" is likely encrypted with a shift that we need to determine. A common approach is to try all possible shifts (from 1 to 25) and see which one results in a meaningful message.\n\nLet's write a Python script to try all possible shifts and print the decrypted message for each shift. We will look for the shift that results in a coherent English sentence.\n\n```python\ndef decrypt_caesar_cipher(text, shift):\n    decrypted_text = []\n    for char in text:\n        if char.isalpha():\n            shift_amount = shift if char.isupper() else shift\n            new_char = chr((ord(char) - shift_amount - 65) % 26 + 65)\n            decrypted_text.append(new_char)\n        else:\n            decrypted_text.append(char)\n    return ''.join(decrypted_text)\n\ncipher_text = \"FK QTL ELROP JO\"\nfor shift in range(1, 26):\n    decrypted_message = decrypt_caesar_cipher(cipher_text, shift)\n    print(f\"Shift {shift}: {decrypted_message}\")\n```\n\nThis script will output all possible decrypted messages for each shift value. We will then identify the correct shift by looking for a meaningful English sentence.",
    "The output from the code execution shows the decrypted messages for each possible shift. We are looking for a meaningful English sentence among these outputs. \n\nFrom the results, the decrypted message for \"Shift 23\" is \"IN TWO HOURS MR\", which appears to be a coherent English sentence.\n\nTherefore, the decrypted text is:\n\n<<<IN TWO HOURS MR>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Decrypt this Caesar cipher text: FK QTL ELROP JO.
