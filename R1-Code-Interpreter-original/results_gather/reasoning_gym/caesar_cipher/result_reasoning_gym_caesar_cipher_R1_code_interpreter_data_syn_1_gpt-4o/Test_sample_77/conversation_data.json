    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.\n\nGiven the text \"PM EIA RCAB NQVQAPQVO BPM LMAAMZB EPMV UZA\", we need to find the shift value that was used to encrypt it. A common approach is to try all possible shifts (from 1 to 25) and see which one results in a meaningful English sentence.\n\nLet's write a Python script to try all possible shifts and print the decrypted text for each shift. We will look for the shift that results in a coherent sentence.\n\n```python\ndef decrypt_caesar_cipher(text, shift):\n    decrypted_text = []\n    for char in text:\n        if char.isalpha():\n            shift_amount = shift if char.isupper() else shift\n            new_char = chr((ord(char) - shift_amount - 65) % 26 + 65)\n            decrypted_text.append(new_char)\n        else:\n            decrypted_text.append(char)\n    return ''.join(decrypted_text)\n\ncipher_text = \"PM EIA RCAB NQVQAPQVO BPM LMAAMZB EPMV UZA\"\n\nfor shift in range(1, 26):\n    decrypted = decrypt_caesar_cipher(cipher_text, shift)\n    print(f\"Shift {shift}: {decrypted}\")\n```\n\nThis script will output the decrypted text for each possible shift, allowing us to identify the correct shift by finding the meaningful English sentence.",
    "The output from the code execution shows the decrypted text for each possible shift. We are looking for a shift that results in a coherent English sentence. \n\nFrom the output, we can see that the text decrypted with a shift of 8 is:\n\n\"HE WAS JUST FINISHING THE DESSERT WHEN MRS\"\n\nThis is a coherent English sentence, indicating that the correct shift for decrypting the Caesar cipher is 8.\n\nTherefore, the decrypted text is:\n\n<<<HE WAS JUST FINISHING THE DESSERT WHEN MRS>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Decrypt this Caesar cipher text: PM EIA RCAB NQVQAPQVO BPM LMAAMZB EPMV UZA.
