    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet. \n\nIn this case, the text \"YRG ZR FRR LBHE GBATHR\" needs to be decrypted. A common approach is to try all possible shifts (from 1 to 25) and see which one results in a meaningful message. \n\nLet's write a Python script to try all possible shifts and print the results. We will then look for the shift that results in a coherent English sentence.\n\n```python\ndef decrypt_caesar_cipher(ciphertext, shift):\n    decrypted_text = []\n    for char in ciphertext:\n        if char.isalpha():\n            shift_amount = shift if char.isupper() else shift\n            new_char = chr((ord(char) - shift_amount - 65) % 26 + 65)\n            decrypted_text.append(new_char)\n        else:\n            decrypted_text.append(char)\n    return ''.join(decrypted_text)\n\nciphertext = \"YRG ZR FRR LBHE GBATHR\"\nfor shift in range(1, 26):\n    decrypted_text = decrypt_caesar_cipher(ciphertext, shift)\n    print(f\"Shift {shift}: {decrypted_text}\")\n```\n\nThis script will output all possible decrypted texts for each shift value. We will then identify the correct decryption.",
    "The output from the code execution shows the decrypted text for each possible shift. We are looking for a coherent English sentence among these outputs. \n\nFrom the results, the decrypted text for shift 13 is \"LET ME SEE YOUR TONGUE,\" which is a meaningful English sentence.\n\nTherefore, the decrypted text is:\n\n<<<LET ME SEE YOUR TONGUE>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Decrypt this Caesar cipher text: YRG ZR FRR LBHE GBATHR.
