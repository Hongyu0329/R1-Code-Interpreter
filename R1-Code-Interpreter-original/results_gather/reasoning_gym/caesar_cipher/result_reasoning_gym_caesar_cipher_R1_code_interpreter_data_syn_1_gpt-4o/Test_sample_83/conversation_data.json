    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. A Caesar cipher shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of places down the alphabet. The challenge is to find the correct shift that was used to encrypt the message.\n\nThe encrypted text is: \"DOLYL OHCL FVB HZRLK TY.\"\n\nA common approach to decrypting a Caesar cipher without knowing the shift is to try all possible shifts (from 1 to 25) and see which one results in a meaningful message. Since the English alphabet has 26 letters, a shift of 26 would return the original text.\n\nLet's write a Python script to try all possible shifts and print the results. We will look for the shift that results in a coherent English sentence.\n\n```python\ndef decrypt_caesar_cipher(text, shift):\n    decrypted_text = []\n    for char in text:\n        if char.isalpha():\n            shift_amount = shift % 26\n            shifted = ord(char) - shift_amount\n            if char.isupper():\n                if shifted < ord('A'):\n                    shifted += 26\n            elif char.islower():\n                if shifted < ord('a'):\n                    shifted += 26\n            decrypted_text.append(chr(shifted))\n        else:\n            decrypted_text.append(char)\n    return ''.join(decrypted_text)\n\ncipher_text = \"DOLYL OHCL FVB HZRLK TY.\"\nfor shift in range(1, 26):\n    decrypted = decrypt_caesar_cipher(cipher_text, shift)\n    print(f\"Shift {shift}: {decrypted}\")\n```\n\nThis script will output all possible decrypted texts for each shift value. We will look for the one that makes sense in English.",
    "From the output of the code, we can see that the decrypted text with a shift of 7 is a coherent English sentence:\n\n\"WHERE HAVE YOU ASKED MR.\"\n\nThis indicates that the original text was encrypted with a shift of 7.\n\n<<<WHERE HAVE YOU ASKED MR.>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Decrypt this Caesar cipher text: DOLYL OHCL FVB HZRLK TY.
