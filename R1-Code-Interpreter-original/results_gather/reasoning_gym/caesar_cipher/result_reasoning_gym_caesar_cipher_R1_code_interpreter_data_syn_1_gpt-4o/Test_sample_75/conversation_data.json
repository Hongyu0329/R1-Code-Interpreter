    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.\n\nGiven the text \"QCNB NBCM MUFFS NBY UOXCYHWY YHXYX\", we need to find the correct shift to decrypt it. A common approach is to try all possible shifts (from 1 to 25) and see which one results in a meaningful message.\n\nLet's write a Python script to try all possible shifts and print the results. We will look for the shift that results in a coherent English sentence.\n\n```python\ndef decrypt_caesar_cipher(text, shift):\n    decrypted_text = []\n    for char in text:\n        if char.isalpha():\n            shifted = ord(char) - shift\n            if char.isupper():\n                if shifted < ord('A'):\n                    shifted += 26\n            else:\n                if shifted < ord('a'):\n                    shifted += 26\n            decrypted_text.append(chr(shifted))\n        else:\n            decrypted_text.append(char)\n    return ''.join(decrypted_text)\n\ncipher_text = \"QCNB NBCM MUFFS NBY UOXCYHWY YHXYX\"\n\nfor shift in range(1, 26):\n    decrypted = decrypt_caesar_cipher(cipher_text, shift)\n    print(f\"Shift {shift}: {decrypted}\")\n```\n\nThis script will try all possible shifts and print the decrypted text for each shift. We will look for the shift that results in a meaningful English sentence.",
    "The output from the code execution shows the decrypted text for each possible shift. The meaningful English sentence appears at shift 20:\n\n\"WITH THIS SALLY THE AUDIENCE ENDED\"\n\nThis indicates that the original text was encrypted with a shift of 20.\n\n<<<WITH THIS SALLY THE AUDIENCE ENDED>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Decrypt this Caesar cipher text: QCNB NBCM MUFFS NBY UOXCYHWY YHXYX.
