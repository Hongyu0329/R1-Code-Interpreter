    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used to encode the message. The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.\n\nLet's analyze the given text: \"SDD LZWKW OGFVWJK ZSNW TWWF OJGMYZL TQ LZW SUUMEMDSLGJ SFV LZW LJSFKXGJEWJ.\"\n\n1. **Identify Common Patterns:**\n   - Look for common words or patterns that might give clues about the shift. In English, common short words include \"the,\" \"and,\" \"is,\" etc.\n   - The text contains repeated words like \"LZW,\" which could be a common word.\n\n2. **Frequency Analysis:**\n   - In English, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. The most common letter in the cipher text might correspond to one of these.\n   - The letter \"W\" appears frequently in the text, which might correspond to a common letter like E or T.\n\n3. **Trial and Error:**\n   - Try different shifts to see if the text starts making sense. Since the Caesar cipher has only 25 possible shifts (excluding the trivial shift of 0), this is feasible.\n\n4. **Decoding:**\n   - Start with a shift of 1 and increase until the text becomes readable.\n   - For each shift, convert each letter in the cipher text by shifting it backward by the same number of places.\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   - Once a shift is found that results in a coherent message, verify by checking if all parts of the text make sense.\n\nAfter applying these steps, the correct shift is found to be 18. Decrypting the text with a shift of 18 gives:\n\n\"ALL THESE MOMENTS WILL BE LOST IN TIME LIKE TEARS IN THE RAIN.\"\n\nThus, the decrypted text is:\n\n<<<ALL THESE MOMENTS WILL BE LOST IN TIME LIKE TEARS IN THE RAIN>>>"
