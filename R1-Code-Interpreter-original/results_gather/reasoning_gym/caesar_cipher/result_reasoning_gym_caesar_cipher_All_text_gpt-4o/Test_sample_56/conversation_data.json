    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.\n\nLet's analyze the given text: \"PU JVUZLXBLUJL VM AOL CPIYHAPVUZ AOL HPY ILJHTL SBTPUVBZ.\"\n\n1. **Identify Common Words**: \n   - The text contains short words like \"PU,\" \"VM,\" and \"AOL,\" which could correspond to common English words like \"OF,\" \"IN,\" \"THE,\" etc.\n\n2. **Frequency Analysis**:\n   - In English, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. \n   - The most common word is \"THE.\"\n\n3. **Trial and Error**:\n   - Let's assume \"AOL\" is \"THE\" because it appears twice and is a three-letter word.\n   - The letter 'A' in \"AOL\" corresponds to 'T', which is a shift of 19 places backward (or 7 places forward, since the alphabet is circular).\n\n4. **Apply the Shift**:\n   - If 'A' is shifted to 'T', then the shift is 7 places forward.\n   - Apply this shift to the entire text.\n\n5. **Decrypt the Text**:\n   - Shift each letter in the text 7 places backward in the alphabet.\n   - P -> I\n   - U -> N\n   - J -> C\n   - V -> O\n   - Z -> S\n   - L -> E\n   - X -> Q\n   - B -> U\n   - M -> F\n   - O -> H\n   - Y -> R\n   - H -> A\n   - P -> I\n   - V -> O\n   - Z -> S\n   - T -> M\n   - S -> L\n   - B -> U\n   - T -> M\n   - P -> I\n   - V -> O\n   - Z -> S\n\n6. **Reconstruct the Sentence**:\n   - \"PU JVUZLXBLUJL VM AOL CPIYHAPVUZ AOL HPY ILJHTL SBTPUVBZ\" becomes:\n   - \"IN CONFUSION OF THE PYRAMIDS THE AIR BECAME LUMINOUS.\"\n\nTherefore, the decrypted text is:\n\n<<<IN CONFUSION OF THE PYRAMIDS THE AIR BECAME LUMINOUS>>>"
