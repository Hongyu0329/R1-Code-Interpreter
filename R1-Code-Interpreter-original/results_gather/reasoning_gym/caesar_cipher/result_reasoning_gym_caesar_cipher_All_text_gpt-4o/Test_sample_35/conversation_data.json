    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.\n\nLet's analyze the given text: \"E ZEPYEFPI MRZIRXMSR ERH QV.\"\n\n1. **Identify the Shift**: \n   - The most common shift used in Caesar ciphers is 3, but it could be any number from 1 to 25.\n   - We will try a shift of 4, which is a common shift used in simple examples.\n\n2. **Decrypt Each Word**:\n   - Shift each letter in the text backward by 4 positions in the alphabet.\n   - For example, 'E' shifted back by 4 becomes 'A'.\n\n3. **Apply the Shift to Each Letter**:\n   - E -> A\n   - Z -> V\n   - E -> A\n   - P -> L\n   - Y -> U\n   - E -> A\n   - F -> B\n   - P -> L\n   - I -> E\n\n   - M -> I\n   - R -> N\n   - Z -> V\n   - I -> E\n   - R -> N\n   - X -> T\n   - M -> I\n   - S -> O\n   - R -> N\n\n   - E -> A\n   - R -> N\n   - H -> D\n\n   - Q -> M\n   - V -> R\n\n4. **Reconstruct the Decrypted Message**:\n   - The decrypted words are: \"A VALUABLE INVENTION AND MR.\"\n\n5. **Verify the Decryption**:\n   - Check if the decrypted message makes sense. In this case, it does.\n\nTherefore, the decrypted text is:\n\n<<<A VALUABLE INVENTION AND MR>>>"
