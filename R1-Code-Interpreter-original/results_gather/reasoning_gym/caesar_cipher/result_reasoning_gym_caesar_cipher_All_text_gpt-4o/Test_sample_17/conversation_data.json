    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used to encode the message. A Caesar cipher shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of places down the alphabet. Let's analyze the given text step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Cipher**: The text is encrypted using a Caesar cipher. Our task is to find the shift value and decrypt the text.\n\n2. **Frequency Analysis**: In English, the most common letters are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. We can use this information to guess the shift by looking at the frequency of letters in the cipher text.\n\n3. **Trial and Error**: We can try different shifts to see which one produces a meaningful message. The Caesar cipher is a simple substitution cipher, so there are only 25 possible shifts (since a shift of 0 or 26 would result in the same text).\n\n4. **Decrypting the Text**: We will try different shifts until we find one that makes sense. \n\n5. **Shift Analysis**: \n   - The first word \"UZODQPUNXQ\" could be a good starting point. If we assume it is a common word, we can try shifting it to see if it becomes a recognizable word.\n   - By trying different shifts, we find that a shift of 12 makes the text readable.\n\n6. **Apply the Shift**: \n   - Shift each letter in the text by 12 places backward in the alphabet.\n\n7. **Decrypted Text**: After applying the correct shift, the text becomes readable.\n\nThe decrypted text is:\n<<<INCONGRUITY EXISTS IN IN ALL THE THEORIES ABOUT THEIR TRUE ORIGIN THAT ARE.>>>"
