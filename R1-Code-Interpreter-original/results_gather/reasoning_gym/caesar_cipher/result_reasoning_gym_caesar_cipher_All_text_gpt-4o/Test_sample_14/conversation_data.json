    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.\n\n1. **Identify the Cipher**: The text \"FUR VF URE URNQ FHAX VA GUR CVYYBJF\" is encrypted using a Caesar cipher. In a Caesar cipher, each letter is shifted by the same number of places.\n\n2. **Common Shifts**: The most common shift used in Caesar ciphers is 13, known as ROT13, which is often used in simple encryption tasks. This is because ROT13 is its own inverse; applying it twice returns the original text.\n\n3. **Decrypt Using ROT13**: \n   - Shift each letter in the text by 13 places backward in the alphabet.\n   - For example, 'F' becomes 'S', 'U' becomes 'H', and so on.\n\n4. **Apply the Shift**:\n   - F -> S\n   - U -> H\n   - R -> E\n   - V -> I\n   - F -> S\n   - U -> H\n   - R -> E\n   - E -> R\n   - U -> H\n   - R -> E\n   - N -> A\n   - Q -> D\n   - F -> S\n   - H -> U\n   - A -> N\n   - X -> K\n   - V -> I\n   - A -> N\n   - G -> T\n   - U -> H\n   - R -> E\n   - C -> P\n   - V -> I\n   - Y -> L\n   - Y -> L\n   - B -> O\n   - J -> W\n   - F -> S\n\n5. **Construct the Decrypted Message**: After applying the ROT13 shift to each letter, the decrypted message is \"SHE IS HER HEAD SUNK IN THE PILLOWS\".\n\n6. **Final Answer**: The decrypted text is the final answer.\n\n<<<SHE IS HER HEAD SUNK IN THE PILLOWS>>>"
