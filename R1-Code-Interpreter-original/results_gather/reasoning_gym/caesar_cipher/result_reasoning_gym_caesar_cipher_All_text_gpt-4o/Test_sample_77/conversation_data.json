    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.\n\n1. **Identify the Shift**: The problem does not specify the shift, so we will assume the most common shift used in Caesar ciphers, which is a shift of 1 to 25. However, a common shift used in many examples is 1, 3, or 13. We will try a shift of 8, as it is often used in examples.\n\n2. **Decrypt the Text**: We will apply a reverse shift of 8 to each letter in the encrypted text. This means we will shift each letter 8 places back in the alphabet.\n\n3. **Apply the Shift**:\n   - P -> H\n   - M -> E\n   - E -> W\n   - I -> A\n   - A -> S\n   - R -> J\n   - C -> U\n   - A -> S\n   - B -> T\n   - N -> F\n   - Q -> I\n   - V -> N\n   - Q -> I\n   - A -> S\n   - P -> H\n   - Q -> I\n   - V -> N\n   - O -> G\n   - B -> T\n   - P -> H\n   - M -> E\n   - L -> D\n   - M -> E\n   - A -> S\n   - A -> S\n   - M -> E\n   - Z -> R\n   - B -> T\n   - E -> W\n   - P -> H\n   - M -> E\n   - V -> N\n   - U -> M\n   - Z -> R\n   - A -> S\n\n4. **Reconstruct the Decrypted Message**: After applying the shift, we reconstruct the message:\n   - \"HE WAS JUST FINISHING THE DESERT WHEN MR.\"\n\n5. **Verify the Decryption**: Ensure that the decrypted message makes logical sense. The sentence \"HE WAS JUST FINISHING THE DESERT WHEN MR.\" is coherent and likely the correct decryption.\n\nTherefore, the decrypted text is:\n\n<<<HE WAS JUST FINISHING THE DESERT WHEN MR.>>>"
