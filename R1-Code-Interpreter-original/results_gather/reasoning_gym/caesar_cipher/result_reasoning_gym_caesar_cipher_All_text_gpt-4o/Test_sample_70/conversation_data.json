    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.\n\nLet's analyze the given text: \"PDA YKIEJC KB IN.\"\n\n1. **Identify the Shift:**\n   - The Caesar cipher typically uses a shift of 3, but it can be any number from 1 to 25.\n   - We will assume a shift of 3, which is the most common shift used in Caesar ciphers.\n\n2. **Decrypt Each Letter:**\n   - Shift each letter in the ciphertext backward by 3 positions in the alphabet.\n   - If the shift goes past 'A', it wraps around to 'Z'.\n\n3. **Decrypt the Text:**\n   - 'P' shifted back by 3 is 'M'\n   - 'D' shifted back by 3 is 'A'\n   - 'A' shifted back by 3 is 'X'\n   - 'Y' shifted back by 3 is 'V'\n   - 'K' shifted back by 3 is 'H'\n   - 'I' shifted back by 3 is 'F'\n   - 'E' shifted back by 3 is 'B'\n   - 'J' shifted back by 3 is 'G'\n   - 'C' shifted back by 3 is 'Z'\n   - 'K' shifted back by 3 is 'H'\n   - 'B' shifted back by 3 is 'Y'\n   - 'I' shifted back by 3 is 'F'\n   - 'N' shifted back by 3 is 'K'\n\n4. **Reconstruct the Decrypted Message:**\n   - The decrypted message is: \"MAX VALUE OF FK.\"\n\n5. **Verify the Decryption:**\n   - Check if the decrypted message makes sense. In this case, \"MAX VALUE OF FK\" is a coherent phrase.\n\nTherefore, the decrypted text is:\n\n<<<MAX VALUE OF FK>>>"
