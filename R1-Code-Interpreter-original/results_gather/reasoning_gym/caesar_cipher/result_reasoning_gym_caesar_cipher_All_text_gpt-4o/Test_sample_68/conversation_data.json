    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used to encode the message. The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.\n\n1. **Identify the Shift**: \n   - The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. \n   - In the given cipher text, the most frequent letters are likely to correspond to these common letters.\n   - We can start by assuming the most frequent letter in the cipher text corresponds to 'E', the most common letter in English.\n\n2. **Frequency Analysis**:\n   - Count the frequency of each letter in the cipher text.\n   - Identify the most frequent letter in the cipher text.\n\n3. **Determine the Shift**:\n   - Calculate the shift by comparing the position of the most frequent letter in the cipher text to the position of 'E' in the alphabet.\n   - For example, if the most frequent letter in the cipher text is 'X', and assuming it corresponds to 'E', the shift would be (X - E) = (24 - 5) = 19.\n\n4. **Decrypt the Text**:\n   - Apply the calculated shift to each letter in the cipher text to get the plaintext.\n   - Shift each letter backwards by the determined shift value.\n\n5. **Verify the Decryption**:\n   - Check if the decrypted text makes sense in English.\n   - If not, try the next most frequent letter in the cipher text and repeat the process.\n\n6. **Final Decryption**:\n   - Once the text is decrypted correctly, it should be coherent and meaningful.\n\nApplying these steps to the given cipher text:\n\n- The most frequent letter in the cipher text is 'I'.\n- Assuming 'I' corresponds to 'E', the shift is (I - E) = (9 - 5) = 4.\n- Decrypting the text with a shift of 4 gives us the plaintext.\n\nAfter decrypting the text, the final answer is:\n\n<<<answer>>>HAVE FAITH WHERE LOVE WILL FIND WHERE FRIENDSHIP EXISTS HAPPINESS BELONGS AND YOUR JOURNEY IS BEAUTIFULLY REWARDED."
