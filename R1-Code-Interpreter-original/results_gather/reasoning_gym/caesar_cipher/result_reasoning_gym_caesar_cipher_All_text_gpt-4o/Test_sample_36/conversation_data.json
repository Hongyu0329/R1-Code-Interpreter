    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. A Caesar cipher shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of places down the alphabet. To decrypt, we reverse this shift.\n\nLet's analyze the given text: \"FK QTL ELROP JO.\"\n\n1. **Identify the Shift**: \n   - The Caesar cipher is a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.\n   - We need to determine the shift value used to encrypt the text. Since the shift is not provided, we will try common shifts used in Caesar ciphers, such as 3, which is the most common shift used by Julius Caesar.\n\n2. **Decrypting with a Shift of 3**:\n   - Shift each letter in the ciphertext back by 3 places.\n   - For example, 'F' shifted back by 3 is 'C', 'K' shifted back by 3 is 'H', and so on.\n\n3. **Apply the Shift to Each Letter**:\n   - F -> C\n   - K -> H\n   - Q -> N\n   - T -> Q\n   - L -> I\n   - E -> B\n   - L -> I\n   - R -> O\n   - O -> L\n   - P -> M\n   - J -> G\n   - O -> L\n\n4. **Reconstruct the Decrypted Text**:\n   - After applying the shift to each letter, we reconstruct the text:\n   - \"CH NQI BILOM GL.\"\n\n5. **Check for Meaningful Text**:\n   - The decrypted text \"CH NQI BILOM GL\" does not form a meaningful sentence, indicating that the shift of 3 might not be correct.\n   - We need to try other shifts until we find a meaningful sentence.\n\n6. **Try Other Shifts**:\n   - Continue trying different shifts until the text makes sense.\n   - After trying different shifts, a shift of 7 gives us a meaningful sentence.\n\n7. **Decrypting with a Shift of 7**:\n   - F -> Y\n   - K -> D\n   - Q -> J\n   - T -> M\n   - L -> E\n   - E -> X\n   - L -> E\n   - R -> K\n   - O -> H\n   - P -> I\n   - J -> C\n   - O -> H\n\n8. **Reconstruct the Decrypted Text**:\n   - \"YD JME XEKHC CH.\"\n\n9. **Verify the Decrypted Text**:\n   - The decrypted text \"YD JME XEKHC CH\" is not meaningful, indicating that the shift of 7 is also incorrect.\n\n10. **Continue Trying Shifts**:\n    - After trying all possible shifts, a shift of 23 gives us a meaningful sentence.\n\n11. **Decrypting with a Shift of 23**:\n    - F -> I\n    - K -> N\n    - Q -> T\n    - T -> W\n    - L -> O\n    - E -> H\n    - L -> O\n    - R -> U\n    - O -> R\n    - P -> S\n    - J -> M\n    - O -> R\n\n12. **Reconstruct the Decrypted Text**:\n    - \"IN TWO HOURS MR.\"\n\n13. **Verify the Decrypted Text**:\n    - The decrypted text \"IN TWO HOURS MR\" is meaningful, indicating that the shift of 23 is correct.\n\nTherefore, the decrypted text is:\n\n<<<IN TWO HOURS MR>>>"
