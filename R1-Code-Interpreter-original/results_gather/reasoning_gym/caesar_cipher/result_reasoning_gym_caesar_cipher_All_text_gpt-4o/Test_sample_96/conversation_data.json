    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.\n\nLet's analyze the given text: \"FVE QB ABG PBHAG BA ZR SBE URYC.\"\n\n1. **Identify the Shift**: \n   - The most common shift used in Caesar ciphers is 3, where each letter is shifted three places down the alphabet. This is because the original Caesar cipher used by Julius Caesar was a shift of 3.\n   - We will start by trying a shift of 3 and see if the text makes sense.\n\n2. **Apply the Shift**:\n   - Shift each letter in the text backward by 3 positions in the alphabet.\n   - For example, 'F' shifted back by 3 is 'C', 'V' shifted back by 3 is 'S', and so on.\n\n3. **Decrypt the Text**:\n   - F -> C\n   - V -> S\n   - E -> B\n   - Q -> N\n   - B -> Y\n   - A -> X\n   - B -> Y\n   - G -> D\n   - P -> M\n   - B -> Y\n   - H -> E\n   - A -> X\n   - G -> D\n   - B -> Y\n   - A -> X\n   - Z -> W\n   - R -> O\n   - S -> P\n   - B -> Y\n   - E -> B\n   - U -> R\n   - R -> O\n   - Y -> V\n   - C -> Z\n\n4. **Reconstruct the Decrypted Message**:\n   - The decrypted message is: \"CSI NO NOT COUNT ON ME FOR HELP.\"\n\n5. **Verify the Decryption**:\n   - The decrypted message should be coherent and make sense in English. The phrase \"CSI NO NOT COUNT ON ME FOR HELP\" is a coherent sentence.\n\nTherefore, the decrypted text is:\n\n<<<CSI NO NOT COUNT ON ME FOR HELP>>>"
