    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.\n\nLet's analyze the given text: \"DOLYL OHCL FVB HZRLK TY.\"\n\n1. **Identify the Shift**: \n   - The Caesar cipher typically uses a shift between 1 and 25. We need to try different shifts to find the one that results in a meaningful English sentence.\n\n2. **Apply the Shift**:\n   - We will apply a reverse shift to each letter in the text. For example, if the shift used was 3, then 'D' would be shifted back to 'A', 'O' to 'L', and so on.\n\n3. **Check for Meaningful Text**:\n   - After applying each shift, we check if the resulting text forms a coherent English sentence.\n\n4. **Iterate Through Possible Shifts**:\n   - We will try each possible shift from 1 to 25 until we find a shift that results in a meaningful sentence.\n\n5. **Decrypt the Text**:\n   - After testing different shifts, we find that a shift of 7 results in a meaningful sentence.\n\n6. **Final Decryption**:\n   - Applying a shift of 7 to the text \"DOLYL OHCL FVB HZRLK TY\" results in the decrypted text: \"WITH GREAT YOU SHALL GO.\"\n\nTherefore, the decrypted text is:\n\n<<<answer>>>WITH GREAT YOU SHALL GO<<<answer>>>"
