    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. A Caesar cipher shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of places down the alphabet. The key to decrypting the message is to find the correct shift value.\n\n1. **Identify the Caesar Cipher**: The text \"IUVEXOMNZ RGC OT IXKGZOTM ZNK VXUPKIZ IURRKIZOUT\" is encrypted using a Caesar cipher. Our task is to find the shift value and decrypt it.\n\n2. **Analyze the Text**: \n   - The text is in uppercase, which is typical for Caesar ciphers.\n   - The text contains spaces, which are not shifted and can help identify word boundaries.\n\n3. **Determine the Shift**:\n   - A common approach is to try all possible shifts (1 through 25) and see which one results in a coherent message.\n   - Alternatively, we can look for common words or patterns. For example, \"ZNK\" could be a common word like \"THE\" if shifted correctly.\n\n4. **Try Shifts**:\n   - Let's assume \"ZNK\" is \"THE\". \n   - 'Z' to 'T' is a backward shift of 6 places.\n   - 'N' to 'H' is a backward shift of 6 places.\n   - 'K' to 'E' is a backward shift of 6 places.\n   - This suggests a shift of 6.\n\n5. **Decrypt the Message**:\n   - Apply a backward shift of 6 to each letter in the text.\n   - I -> C\n   - U -> O\n   - V -> P\n   - E -> Y\n   - X -> R\n   - O -> I\n   - M -> G\n   - N -> H\n   - Z -> T\n   - R -> L\n   - G -> A\n   - C -> W\n   - T -> N\n   - K -> E\n   - G -> A\n   - Z -> T\n   - O -> I\n   - T -> N\n   - M -> G\n   - V -> P\n   - X -> R\n   - U -> O\n   - P -> J\n   - K -> E\n   - I -> C\n   - Z -> T\n   - O -> I\n   - U -> O\n   - T -> N\n\n6. **Construct the Decrypted Message**:\n   - The decrypted message is: \"COPYRIGHT LAW IN WRITING THE PROJECT COORDINATOR\".\n\n7. **Final Answer**:\n   - The decrypted text is: <<<COPYRIGHT LAW IN WRITING THE PROJECT COORDINATOR>>>"
