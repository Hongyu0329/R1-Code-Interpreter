    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.\n\nLet's analyze the given text: \"YRG ZR FRR LBHE GBATHR.\"\n\n1. **Identify the Shift:**\n   - The Caesar cipher typically uses a shift of 3, but it can be any number from 1 to 25.\n   - We will assume a shift of 3, which is the most common, and check if it makes sense.\n\n2. **Decrypt Each Word:**\n   - Shift each letter in the text backward by 3 positions in the alphabet.\n   - If a letter is at the beginning of the alphabet, wrap around to the end.\n\n3. **Decrypt \"YRG\":**\n   - Y -> V\n   - R -> O\n   - G -> D\n   - \"YRG\" decrypts to \"VOD.\"\n\n4. **Decrypt \"ZR\":**\n   - Z -> W\n   - R -> O\n   - \"ZR\" decrypts to \"WO.\"\n\n5. **Decrypt \"FRR\":**\n   - F -> C\n   - R -> O\n   - R -> O\n   - \"FRR\" decrypts to \"COO.\"\n\n6. **Decrypt \"LBHE\":**\n   - L -> I\n   - B -> Y\n   - H -> E\n   - E -> B\n   - \"LBHE\" decrypts to \"IYEB.\"\n\n7. **Decrypt \"GBATHR\":**\n   - G -> D\n   - B -> Y\n   - A -> X\n   - T -> Q\n   - H -> E\n   - R -> O\n   - \"GBATHR\" decrypts to \"DYXQEO.\"\n\n8. **Reconstruct the Sentence:**\n   - Combine the decrypted words: \"VOD WO COO IYEB DYXQEO.\"\n\n9. **Check for Meaning:**\n   - The decrypted text does not form a meaningful sentence, indicating the shift might not be 3.\n   - We need to try other shifts until we find a meaningful sentence.\n\n10. **Try Shift of 13:**\n    - A shift of 13 is also common in Caesar ciphers (ROT13).\n    - Decrypt each letter by shifting backward by 13 positions.\n\n11. **Decrypt with Shift 13:**\n    - \"YRG\" -> \"LET\"\n    - \"ZR\" -> \"ME\"\n    - \"FRR\" -> \"SEE\"\n    - \"LBHE\" -> \"YOUR\"\n    - \"GBATHR\" -> \"TONGUE\"\n\n12. **Reconstruct the Sentence:**\n    - Combine the decrypted words: \"LET ME SEE YOUR TONGUE.\"\n\n13. **Verify:**\n    - The sentence \"LET ME SEE YOUR TONGUE\" is meaningful and coherent.\n\nTherefore, the decrypted text is:\n\n<<<LET ME SEE YOUR TONGUE>>>"
