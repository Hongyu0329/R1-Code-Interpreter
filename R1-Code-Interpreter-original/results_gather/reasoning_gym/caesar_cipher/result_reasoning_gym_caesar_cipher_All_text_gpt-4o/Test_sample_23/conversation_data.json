    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used to encode the message. The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.\n\n1. **Identify the Shift**: The most common shift in a Caesar cipher is 3, but it can be any number from 1 to 25. We will try a shift of 7, which is a common shift used in many examples.\n\n2. **Apply the Shift**: To decrypt, we shift each letter in the ciphertext backward by the determined number of places. If the shift is 7, we move each letter 7 places back in the alphabet.\n\n3. **Decrypt the Text**: \n   - M shifted back by 7 is F\n   - P shifted back by 7 is I\n   - Y shifted back by 7 is R\n   - Z shifted back by 7 is S\n   - A shifted back by 7 is T\n   - O shifted back by 7 is H\n   - L shifted back by 7 is E\n   - L shifted back by 7 is E\n   - U shifted back by 7 is N\n   - A shifted back by 7 is T\n   - L shifted back by 7 is E\n   - Y shifted back by 7 is R\n   - Z shifted back by 7 is S\n   - A shifted back by 7 is T\n   - O shifted back by 7 is H\n   - L shifted back by 7 is E\n   - O shifted back by 7 is H\n   - H shifted back by 7 is A\n   - S shifted back by 7 is L\n   - S shifted back by 7 is L\n   - V shifted back by 7 is O\n   - M shifted back by 7 is F\n   - A shifted back by 7 is T\n   - O shifted back by 7 is H\n   - L shifted back by 7 is E\n   - H shifted back by 7 is A\n   - C shifted back by 7 is V\n   - H shifted back by 7 is A\n   - Z shifted back by 7 is S\n   - A shifted back by 7 is T\n   - H shifted back by 7 is A\n   - W shifted back by 7 is P\n   - H shifted back by 7 is A\n   - Y shifted back by 7 is R\n   - A shifted back by 7 is T\n   - L shifted back by 7 is E\n   - U shifted back by 7 is N\n   - A shifted back by 7 is T\n   - J shifted back by 7 is C\n   - Y shifted back by 7 is R\n   - V shifted back by 7 is O\n   - D shifted back by 7 is W\n   - U shifted back by 7 is N\n   - L shifted back by 7 is E\n   - K shifted back by 7 is D\n   - D shifted back by 7 is W\n   - P shifted back by 7 is I\n   - A shifted back by 7 is T\n   - O shifted back by 7 is H\n   - H shifted back by 7 is A\n   - U shifted back by 7 is N\n   - L shifted back by 7 is E\n   - V shifted back by 7 is O\n   - Y shifted back by 7 is R\n   - M shifted back by 7 is F\n   - V shifted back by 7 is O\n   - B shifted back by 7 is U\n   - Z shifted back by 7 is S\n   - A shifted back by 7 is T\n   - Y shifted back by 7 is R\n   - H shifted back by 7 is A\n   - U shifted back by 7 is N\n   - Z shifted back by 7 is S\n   - W shifted back by 7 is P\n   - H shifted back by 7 is A\n   - Y shifted back by 7 is R\n   - L shifted back by 7 is E\n   - U shifted back by 7 is N\n   - A shifted back by 7 is T\n   - J shifted back by 7 is C\n   - B shifted back by 7 is U\n   - W shifted back by 7 is P\n   - V shifted back by 7 is O\n   - S shifted back by 7 is L\n   - H shifted back by 7 is A\n\n4. **Construct the Decrypted Message**: After applying the shift to each letter, we get the decrypted message.\n\nThe decrypted text is:\n<<<answer>>>FIRST TO ENTER THE HALL OF THE VAST APPARTMENT CROWDED WITH AN ENORMOUS TRANSPARENT CUPOLA."
