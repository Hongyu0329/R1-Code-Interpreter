    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used to encode the message. The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.\n\n1. **Identify the Shift**: \n   - The Caesar cipher typically uses a shift between 1 and 25. We need to try each shift to find the one that results in a meaningful message.\n\n2. **Apply the Shift**:\n   - For each letter in the ciphertext, shift it backward by the same number of places to get the plaintext letter.\n   - If the shift takes you past 'A', wrap around to the end of the alphabet.\n\n3. **Check for Meaningful Text**:\n   - After applying each shift, check if the resulting text is meaningful English. This will help identify the correct shift.\n\n4. **Decrypt the Message**:\n   - Once the correct shift is identified, apply it to the entire message to get the decrypted text.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given ciphertext:\n\n- The ciphertext is: \"PBSDJ XKZYVOYX CWSDR LYEQRD SD PYB K WOBO KXN YBSQSXKDON DOVOZRYXSM TYEBXKVSCW.\"\n\n- By trying different shifts, we find that a shift of 10 results in a meaningful message.\n\n- Applying a backward shift of 10 to each letter in the ciphertext gives us the decrypted text.\n\nThe decrypted text is:\n\n<<<answer>>> \"JULIA PETERSON SHOULD RETURN TO HER A WEEK AND IMPORTANT BUSINESS MEETING.\""
