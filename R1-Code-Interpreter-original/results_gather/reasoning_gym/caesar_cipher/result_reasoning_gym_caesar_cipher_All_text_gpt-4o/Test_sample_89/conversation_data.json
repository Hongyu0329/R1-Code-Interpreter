    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.\n\nLet's analyze the given text: \"ADV TPUBALZ SHALY AOL THJOPUL KLWVZPALK OPT HSS KYLZZLK HA AOL AOYLZOVSK VM OPZ VMMPJLZ.\"\n\n1. **Identify the Shift**: \n   - The most common shift in Caesar ciphers is 3, but it can be any number from 1 to 25.\n   - We can try different shifts to see which one produces a meaningful message.\n\n2. **Apply the Shift**:\n   - For each letter in the text, shift it backwards by the same number of positions in the alphabet.\n   - If the shift goes past 'A', it wraps around to 'Z'.\n\n3. **Check for Meaningful Text**:\n   - After applying a shift, check if the resulting text makes sense in English.\n\n4. **Iterate Through Possible Shifts**:\n   - Start with a shift of 1 and increase until a coherent message is found.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- **Shift 7**: \n  - A shift of 7 backwards on each letter of the text results in a coherent message.\n\n5. **Decrypted Text**:\n   - After applying the correct shift, the decrypted text is: \"THE MOUNTAIN DWELL THE CHOPINE DEPOSITED HIS ALL DRESSED IN THE THREESOME OF HIS OFFICE.\"\n\nTherefore, the decrypted text is:\n\n<<<THE MOUNTAIN DWELL THE CHOPINE DEPOSITED HIS ALL DRESSED IN THE THREESOME OF HIS OFFICE>>>"
