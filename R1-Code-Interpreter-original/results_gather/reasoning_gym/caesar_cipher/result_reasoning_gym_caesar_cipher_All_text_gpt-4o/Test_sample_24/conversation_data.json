    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. The Caesar cipher shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of places down the alphabet. In this case, we need to find the shift that was applied to the text \"BOE BOZ BEEJUJPOBM UFSNT JNQPTFE CZ UIF DPQZSJHIU IPMEFS.\"\n\nLet's analyze the text step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Shift**: \n   - The word \"BOE\" is likely a common word. In English, \"AND\" is a common three-letter word. If we assume \"BOE\" is \"AND,\" then the shift is 1 (B -> A, O -> N, E -> D).\n\n2. **Apply the Shift**:\n   - If the shift is 1, we will shift each letter in the text one place back in the alphabet.\n\n3. **Decrypt the Text**:\n   - B -> A\n   - O -> N\n   - E -> D\n   - B -> A\n   - O -> N\n   - Z -> Y\n   - B -> A\n   - E -> D\n   - E -> D\n   - J -> I\n   - U -> T\n   - J -> I\n   - P -> O\n   - O -> N\n   - B -> A\n   - M -> L\n   - U -> T\n   - F -> E\n   - S -> R\n   - N -> M\n   - T -> S\n   - J -> I\n   - N -> M\n   - Q -> P\n   - P -> O\n   - T -> S\n   - F -> E\n   - D -> C\n   - C -> B\n   - Z -> Y\n   - U -> T\n   - I -> H\n   - F -> E\n   - D -> C\n   - P -> O\n   - Q -> P\n   - Z -> Y\n   - S -> R\n   - J -> I\n   - H -> G\n   - I -> H\n   - U -> T\n   - I -> H\n   - P -> O\n   - M -> L\n   - E -> D\n   - F -> E\n   - S -> R\n\n4. **Construct the Decrypted Message**:\n   - The decrypted message is: \"AND ANY ADDITIONAL TERMS IMPOSED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER.\"\n\nTherefore, the final decrypted text is:\n\n<<<AND ANY ADDITIONAL TERMS IMPOSED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER>>>"
