    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to understand that it is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. In this case, we need to determine the shift used in the cipher.\n\n1. **Identify the Shift**: \n   - The text \"UIF\" is likely \"THE\" in plaintext, as \"THE\" is a common English word. \n   - Comparing \"UIF\" to \"THE\", we see that each letter is shifted by one position forward in the alphabet:\n     - U -> T (shifted back by 1)\n     - I -> H (shifted back by 1)\n     - F -> E (shifted back by 1)\n\n2. **Apply the Shift**:\n   - Now that we know the shift is 1, we apply this shift to each letter in the cipher text to decrypt it.\n   - Shift each letter in the text back by one position in the alphabet.\n\n3. **Decrypt the Text**:\n   - U -> T\n   - I -> H\n   - F -> E\n   - D -> C\n   - B -> A\n   - S -> R\n   - L -> K\n   - F -> E\n   - U -> T\n   - C -> B\n   - F -> E\n   - J -> I\n   - O -> N\n   - H -> G\n   - M -> L\n   - J -> I\n   - E -> D\n   - P -> O\n   - G -> F\n   - T -> S\n   - X -> W\n   - B -> A\n   - S -> R\n   - H -> G\n   - O -> N\n   - S -> R\n   - F -> E\n   - A -> Z\n   - D -> C\n   - J -> I\n   - O -> N\n   - F -> E\n   - S -> R\n   - S -> R\n\n4. **Construct the Decrypted Message**:\n   - The decrypted message is: \"THE CASKET BEING LAID DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE THE TELEPHONE WAS GOT IN READINESS.\"\n\n5. **Output the Final Answer**:\n   - The decrypted text is the final answer.\n\n<<<answer>>>THE CASKET BEING LAID DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE THE TELEPHONE WAS GOT IN READINESS.<<<answer>>>"
