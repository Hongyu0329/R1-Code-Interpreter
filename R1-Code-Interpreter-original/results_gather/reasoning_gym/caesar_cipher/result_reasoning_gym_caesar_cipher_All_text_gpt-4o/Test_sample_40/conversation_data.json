    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used to encode the message. The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.\n\nLet's analyze the given text: \"NBY BYLY CM UHINBYL IZ NBY ALYUN NLCOGJBM IZ MWCYHWY CH IOL NCGY.\"\n\n1. **Identify Common Words**: \n   - The text contains repeated words like \"NBY\" and \"IZ\". In English, common short words include \"the\", \"and\", \"is\", etc. \n   - \"NBY\" appears multiple times and could potentially be \"THE\", a very common word in English.\n\n2. **Determine the Shift**:\n   - If \"NBY\" is \"THE\", then:\n     - N -> T\n     - B -> H\n     - Y -> E\n   - Calculate the shift for each letter:\n     - N (14th letter) to T (20th letter) is a shift of 6.\n     - B (2nd letter) to H (8th letter) is a shift of 6.\n     - Y (25th letter) to E (5th letter) is a shift of 6 (considering wrap-around).\n\n3. **Apply the Shift**:\n   - The shift appears to be consistent, so we apply a backward shift of 6 to each letter in the text.\n\n4. **Decrypt the Text**:\n   - N -> T\n   - B -> H\n   - Y -> E\n   - L -> R\n   - C -> I\n   - M -> S\n   - U -> A\n   - I -> O\n   - Z -> F\n   - A -> G\n   - O -> U\n   - G -> M\n   - J -> P\n   - B -> H\n   - W -> C\n   - H -> N\n   - O -> U\n   - L -> R\n   - G -> M\n\n5. **Construct the Decrypted Message**:\n   - \"NBY BYLY CM UHINBYL IZ NBY ALYUN NLCOGJBM IZ MWCYHWY CH IOL NCGY.\"\n   - Decrypting each word:\n     - NBY -> THE\n     - BYLY -> HERE\n     - CM -> IS\n     - UHINBYL -> ANOTHER\n     - IZ -> OF\n     - NBY -> THE\n     - ALYUN -> FIRST\n     - NLCOGJBM -> MESSAGE\n     - IZ -> OF\n     - MWCYHWY -> SECURITY\n     - CH -> IN\n     - IOL -> OUR\n     - NCGY -> TIME\n\n6. **Final Decrypted Text**:\n   - \"THE HERE IS ANOTHER OF THE FIRST MESSAGE OF SECURITY IN OUR TIME.\"\n\nTherefore, the decrypted text is:\n\n<<<THE HERE IS ANOTHER OF THE FIRST MESSAGE OF SECURITY IN OUR TIME>>>"
