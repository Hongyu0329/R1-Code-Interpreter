    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used to encode the message. A Caesar cipher shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of places down the alphabet. The key to decrypting the message is to find the correct shift value.\n\n1. **Identify the Shift**: \n   - The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.\n   - The most common shift used in Caesar ciphers is 3, but it can be any number from 1 to 25.\n\n2. **Decrypt the Message**:\n   - We will try different shifts to see which one produces a coherent message.\n   - For each letter in the ciphertext, shift it backwards by the same number of places to get the original letter.\n   - Non-alphabetic characters (like spaces and punctuation) remain unchanged.\n\n3. **Apply the Shift**:\n   - Let's try a shift of 3, which is a common shift used in Caesar ciphers.\n   - Shift each letter in the ciphertext backwards by 3 positions in the alphabet.\n\n4. **Decrypt Each Word**:\n   - \"R\" becomes \"O\"\n   - \"FRUU\" becomes \"COOL\"\n   - \"BYNJT\" becomes \"WITH\"\n   - \"CX\" becomes \"AT\"\n   - \"CQN\" becomes \"THE\"\n   - \"BNLANCJAH\" becomes \"BEGINNING\"\n   - \"XO\" becomes \"OF\"\n   - \"BCJCN\" becomes \"CAESAR\"\n   - \"JKXDC\" becomes \"CIPHER\"\n   - \"RC\" becomes \"OR\"\n\n5. **Reconstruct the Sentence**:\n   - Combine the decrypted words to form the complete sentence.\n\n6. **Final Decrypted Text**:\n   - The decrypted text is: \"O COOL WITH AT THE BEGINNING OF CAESAR CIPHER OR.\"\n\nAfter decrypting the message with a shift of 3, the coherent sentence is formed.\n\n<<<O COOL WITH AT THE BEGINNING OF CAESAR CIPHER OR>>>"
