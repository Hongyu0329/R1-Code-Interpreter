    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.\n\n1. **Identify the Shift**: \n   - The Caesar cipher typically uses a shift between 1 and 25. We need to try each shift to find the one that results in a meaningful message.\n\n2. **Apply the Shift**:\n   - For each letter in the encrypted text, shift it backward by the same number of places used in the encryption. If the shift goes past 'A', it wraps around to 'Z'.\n\n3. **Check for Meaningful Text**:\n   - After applying each shift, check if the resulting text is meaningful in English. This will help identify the correct shift.\n\n4. **Decrypt the Text**:\n   - Once the correct shift is identified, apply it to the entire text to get the decrypted message.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given text:\n\n- The encrypted text is: \"TKGXRE GRR ZNK OTJOBOJAGR CUXQY OT ZNK IURRKIZOUT GXK OT ZNK VAHROI JUSGOT OT ZNK ATOZKJ YZGZKY.\"\n\n- By trying different shifts, we find that a shift of 6 results in a meaningful message.\n\n- Decrypting with a shift of 6:\n  - T -> N\n  - K -> E\n  - G -> A\n  - X -> R\n  - R -> L\n  - E -> Y\n  - (and so on for the rest of the text)\n\n- The decrypted text is: \"NEARLY ALL THE IMPORTANT BREAKTHROUGHS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT OF THE MODERN WORLD.\"\n\nTherefore, the decrypted text is:\n\n<<<NEARLY ALL THE IMPORTANT BREAKTHROUGHS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT OF THE MODERN WORLD>>>"
