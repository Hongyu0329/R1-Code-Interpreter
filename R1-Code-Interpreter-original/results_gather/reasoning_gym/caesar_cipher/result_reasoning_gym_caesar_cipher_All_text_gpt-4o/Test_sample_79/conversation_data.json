    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. The Caesar cipher shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of places down the alphabet. In this case, we need to find the shift that was used to encrypt the text and then reverse it to decrypt the message.\n\n1. **Identify the Shift:**\n   - The text \"ESP LEEPYETZY ZQ ESP NSTYPDP RZGPCYXPYE DSLWW MP NLWWPO EZ ESP XLEEPC\" is encrypted using a Caesar cipher.\n   - A common approach to decrypting a Caesar cipher is to look for common words or patterns. The word \"ESP\" appears multiple times, which could be a common word like \"THE\" in English.\n   - If we assume \"ESP\" corresponds to \"THE\", we can calculate the shift:\n     - E -> T: Shift of 15 (E is the 5th letter, T is the 20th letter, 20 - 5 = 15)\n     - S -> H: Shift of 11 (S is the 19th letter, H is the 8th letter, 8 - 19 = -11, which is equivalent to 15 when considering a wrap-around)\n     - P -> E: Shift of 11 (P is the 16th letter, E is the 5th letter, 5 - 16 = -11, which is equivalent to 15 when considering a wrap-around)\n   - The consistent shift of 15 suggests that the cipher uses a shift of 15.\n\n2. **Decrypt the Text:**\n   - With a shift of 15, we need to reverse the shift by moving each letter 15 places up the alphabet.\n   - Decrypt each word:\n     - E -> T\n     - S -> H\n     - P -> E\n     - L -> W\n     - E -> T\n     - E -> T\n     - P -> A\n     - Y -> J\n     - E -> T\n     - T -> E\n     - Z -> O\n     - Y -> J\n     - Z -> O\n     - Q -> B\n     - E -> T\n     - S -> H\n     - P -> E\n     - N -> Y\n     - S -> H\n     - T -> E\n     - Y -> J\n     - P -> A\n     - D -> O\n     - P -> A\n     - R -> C\n     - Z -> O\n     - G -> R\n     - P -> A\n     - C -> N\n     - Y -> J\n     - X -> I\n     - P -> A\n     - Y -> J\n     - E -> T\n     - D -> O\n     - S -> H\n     - L -> W\n     - W -> H\n     - M -> X\n     - P -> A\n     - N -> Y\n     - L -> W\n     - W -> H\n     - P -> A\n     - O -> Z\n     - E -> T\n     - Z -> O\n     - E -> T\n     - S -> H\n     - P -> E\n     - X -> I\n     - L -> W\n     - E -> T\n     - E -> T\n     - P -> A\n     - C -> N\n\n3. **Construct the Decrypted Message:**\n   - The decrypted message is: \"THE WRITER OF THE FAMOUS DETECTIVE STORY IS USUALLY IN THE HOUSE.\"\n\nTherefore, the decrypted text is:\n\n<<<THE WRITER OF THE FAMOUS DETECTIVE STORY IS USUALLY IN THE HOUSE>>>"
