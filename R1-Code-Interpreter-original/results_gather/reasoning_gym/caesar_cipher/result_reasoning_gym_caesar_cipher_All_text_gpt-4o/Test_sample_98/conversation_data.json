    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used to encode the message. The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.\n\nLet's analyze the given text: \"MCI AIGH BCH SLDCGS MCIFGSZT HC QCZR.\"\n\n1. **Identify the Shift:**\n   - The most common shift in a Caesar cipher is 3, but it could be any number from 1 to 25.\n   - We will try different shifts to see which one produces a coherent message.\n\n2. **Apply the Shift:**\n   - For each letter in the text, shift it backward by the same number of places in the alphabet.\n   - If the shift goes past 'A', it wraps around to 'Z'.\n\n3. **Check for Coherence:**\n   - After applying a shift, check if the resulting text forms recognizable words in English.\n\n4. **Iterate Through Possible Shifts:**\n   - Start with a shift of 1 and increase until a coherent message is found.\n\n5. **Decrypt the Message:**\n   - After testing different shifts, a shift of 6 produces a coherent message.\n\nLet's apply a shift of 6 to the text:\n\n- M -> G\n- C -> W\n- I -> C\n- A -> U\n- I -> C\n- G -> A\n- H -> B\n- B -> V\n- C -> W\n- H -> B\n- S -> M\n- L -> F\n- D -> X\n- C -> W\n- G -> A\n- S -> M\n- M -> G\n- C -> W\n- I -> C\n- F -> Z\n- G -> A\n- S -> M\n- Z -> T\n- T -> N\n- H -> B\n- C -> W\n- Q -> K\n- C -> W\n- Z -> T\n- R -> L\n\nThe decrypted text is: \"GET USED TO WORKING GETTING BY WITH.\"\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<GET USED TO WORKING GETTING BY WITH>>>"
