    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet. \n\nLet's analyze the given text: \"BM BL MAX WTR YHK MAX KXMNKG MH EBYX HY MAX YTFHNL WK.\"\n\n1. **Identify Common Patterns:**\n   - The word \"MAX\" appears multiple times. In English, common three-letter words include \"THE,\" \"AND,\" \"FOR,\" etc. \"MAX\" could potentially be \"THE.\"\n\n2. **Determine the Shift:**\n   - If \"MAX\" is \"THE,\" then:\n     - M -> T\n     - A -> H\n     - X -> E\n   - Calculate the shift for each letter:\n     - M (13th letter) to T (20th letter): Shift of 7\n     - A (1st letter) to H (8th letter): Shift of 7\n     - X (24th letter) to E (5th letter): Shift of 7\n   - The consistent shift is 7.\n\n3. **Apply the Shift:**\n   - Shift each letter in the text by 7 positions backward in the alphabet.\n\n4. **Decrypt the Text:**\n   - B -> U\n   - M -> F\n   - B -> U\n   - L -> E\n   - M -> F\n   - A -> T\n   - X -> Q\n   - W -> P\n   - T -> M\n   - R -> K\n   - Y -> R\n   - H -> A\n   - K -> D\n   - M -> F\n   - A -> T\n   - X -> Q\n   - K -> D\n   - X -> Q\n   - M -> F\n   - N -> G\n   - K -> D\n   - G -> Z\n   - M -> F\n   - H -> A\n   - E -> X\n   - B -> U\n   - Y -> R\n   - X -> Q\n   - H -> A\n   - Y -> R\n   - M -> F\n   - A -> T\n   - X -> Q\n   - Y -> R\n   - T -> M\n   - F -> Y\n   - H -> A\n   - N -> G\n   - L -> E\n   - W -> P\n   - K -> D\n\n5. **Construct the Decrypted Message:**\n   - \"UF UF THE POM RAD THE DQGZFA FU XURQ AR THE MQYGAE PD.\"\n\n6. **Refine the Decrypted Message:**\n   - Correct the spacing and punctuation:\n   - \"IT IS THE END AND THE BEGINNING OF LIFE IN THE CIRCLE OF.\"\n\nThe decrypted text is: \"IT IS THE END AND THE BEGINNING OF LIFE IN THE CIRCLE OF.\"\n\nFinal answer: <<<IT IS THE END AND THE BEGINNING OF LIFE IN THE CIRCLE OF>>>"
