    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used to encode the message. The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Cipher**: The text given is \"X AFPZRPPFLK TXP DLFKD LK TEBK EB BKQBOBA.\" This is a Caesar cipher, which means each letter is shifted by the same number of places.\n\n2. **Determine the Shift**: In a Caesar cipher, the shift is usually a number between 1 and 25. We need to find the correct shift that makes the text readable.\n\n3. **Try Common Shifts**: The most common shift used in Caesar ciphers is 3, but it could be any number. We will try different shifts until the text makes sense.\n\n4. **Decrypt the Text**: We will shift each letter backwards by the determined number of places. If the shift is 3, for example, 'X' would become 'U', 'A' would become 'X', and so on.\n\n5. **Check for Readability**: After applying a shift, check if the resulting text is readable and makes sense in English.\n\n6. **Iterate if Necessary**: If the text is not readable, try the next shift value.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- **Shift 3**: \n  - 'X' becomes 'U'\n  - 'A' becomes 'X'\n  - 'F' becomes 'C'\n  - 'P' becomes 'M'\n  - 'Z' becomes 'W'\n  - 'R' becomes 'O'\n  - 'P' becomes 'M'\n  - 'P' becomes 'M'\n  - 'F' becomes 'C'\n  - 'L' becomes 'I'\n  - 'K' becomes 'H'\n  - 'T' becomes 'Q'\n  - 'X' becomes 'U'\n  - 'P' becomes 'M'\n  - 'D' becomes 'A'\n  - 'L' becomes 'I'\n  - 'F' becomes 'C'\n  - 'K' becomes 'H'\n  - 'D' becomes 'A'\n  - 'L' becomes 'I'\n  - 'K' becomes 'H'\n  - 'T' becomes 'Q'\n  - 'E' becomes 'B'\n  - 'B' becomes 'Y'\n  - 'K' becomes 'H'\n  - 'E' becomes 'B'\n  - 'B' becomes 'Y'\n  - 'K' becomes 'H'\n  - 'Q' becomes 'N'\n  - 'B' becomes 'Y'\n  - 'O' becomes 'L'\n  - 'B' becomes 'Y'\n  - 'A' becomes 'X'\n\nAfter applying a shift of 3, the text becomes: \"U WCMOMMCIH QUM AICHA IH QBYH BY YLYXLYX.\"\n\nThis text is not readable, so we need to try another shift.\n\n- **Shift 23**: \n  - 'X' becomes 'A'\n  - 'A' becomes 'D'\n  - 'F' becomes 'I'\n  - 'P' becomes 'S'\n  - 'Z' becomes 'C'\n  - 'R' becomes 'U'\n  - 'P' becomes 'S'\n  - 'P' becomes 'S'\n  - 'F' becomes 'I'\n  - 'L' becomes 'O'\n  - 'K' becomes 'N'\n  - 'T' becomes 'W'\n  - 'X' becomes 'A'\n  - 'P' becomes 'S'\n  - 'D' becomes 'G'\n  - 'L' becomes 'O'\n  - 'F' becomes 'I'\n  - 'K' becomes 'N'\n  - 'D' becomes 'G'\n  - 'L' becomes 'O'\n  - 'K' becomes 'N'\n  - 'T' becomes 'W'\n  - 'E' becomes 'H'\n  - 'B' becomes 'E'\n  - 'K' becomes 'N'\n  - 'E' becomes 'H'\n  - 'B' becomes 'E'\n  - 'K' becomes 'N'\n  - 'Q' becomes 'T'\n  - 'B' becomes 'E'\n  - 'O' becomes 'R'\n  - 'B' becomes 'E'\n  - 'A' becomes 'D'\n\nAfter applying a shift of 23, the text becomes: \"A DISCUSSED WAS GOING ON WHEN HE ENTERED.\"\n\nThis text is readable and makes sense in English.\n\nTherefore, the decrypted text is:\n\n<<<A DISCUSSION WAS GOING ON WHEN HE ENTERED>>>"
