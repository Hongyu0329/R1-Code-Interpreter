    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.\n\nLet's analyze the given text: \"IWGSVXIH FC E RYQIVSYW GSQTERC SJ QIR SJ WGMIRGI.\"\n\n1. **Identify the Shift**: \n   - The Caesar cipher typically uses a shift of 3, but it can be any number. We need to determine the correct shift by analyzing the text.\n   - Common words like \"THE,\" \"AND,\" or \"OF\" can help identify the shift. In this case, \"FC\" could be \"OF,\" suggesting a shift of 4 (F -> O, C -> F).\n\n2. **Apply the Shift**:\n   - If the shift is 4, each letter in the ciphertext is shifted 4 places back in the alphabet to get the plaintext.\n   - For example, I -> E, W -> S, G -> C, and so on.\n\n3. **Decrypt the Text**:\n   - Apply the shift to each letter in the text:\n     - I -> E\n     - W -> S\n     - G -> C\n     - S -> O\n     - V -> R\n     - X -> T\n     - I -> E\n     - H -> D\n     - FC -> OF\n     - E -> A\n     - R -> N\n     - Y -> U\n     - Q -> M\n     - I -> E\n     - V -> R\n     - S -> O\n     - Y -> U\n     - W -> S\n     - GSQTERC -> COMPUTE\n     - SJ -> OF\n     - QIR -> MEN\n     - SJ -> OF\n     - WGMIRGI -> SCIENCE\n\n4. **Construct the Decrypted Message**:\n   - After applying the shift, the decrypted message is: \"ESCORTED OF A NUMEROUS COMPANY OF MEN OF SCIENCE.\"\n\n5. **Verify the Decryption**:\n   - The decrypted message should make logical sense and be grammatically correct, which it does in this case.\n\nTherefore, the decrypted text is:\n\n<<<ESCORTED OF A NUMEROUS COMPANY OF MEN OF SCIENCE>>>"
