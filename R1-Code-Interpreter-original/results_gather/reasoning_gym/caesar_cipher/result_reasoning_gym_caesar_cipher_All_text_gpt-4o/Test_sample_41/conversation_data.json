    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.\n\n1. **Identify the Shift**: The most common shift used in Caesar ciphers is 3, but it can be any number from 1 to 25. We will start by assuming a shift of 4, which is a common choice, and adjust if necessary.\n\n2. **Decrypt the Text**: \n   - The encrypted text is: \"LI AEW NYWX JMRMWLMRK XLI HIWWIVX ALIR QVW.\"\n   - We will shift each letter 4 places back in the alphabet. For example, 'L' shifted back 4 places becomes 'H', 'I' becomes 'E', and so on.\n\n3. **Apply the Shift**:\n   - L -> H\n   - I -> E\n   - A -> W\n   - E -> A\n   - W -> S\n   - N -> J\n   - Y -> U\n   - X -> T\n   - J -> F\n   - M -> I\n   - R -> N\n   - W -> S\n   - L -> H\n   - M -> I\n   - R -> N\n   - K -> G\n   - X -> T\n   - L -> H\n   - I -> E\n   - H -> D\n   - I -> E\n   - W -> S\n   - S -> O\n   - V -> R\n   - X -> T\n   - A -> W\n   - L -> H\n   - I -> E\n   - R -> N\n   - Q -> M\n   - V -> R\n   - W -> S\n\n4. **Construct the Decrypted Message**: \n   - After applying the shift, the decrypted message is: \"HE WAS JUST THINKING THE DESERT WHEN MRS.\"\n\n5. **Verify the Decryption**: \n   - The decrypted message should make logical sense. In this case, it appears to be a coherent sentence fragment, suggesting the decryption is correct.\n\n6. **Output the Decrypted Text**: \n   - The final decrypted text is: \"HE WAS JUST THINKING THE DESERT WHEN MRS.\"\n\n<<<HE WAS JUST THINKING THE DESERT WHEN MRS.>>>"
