    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet. \n\n1. **Identify the Shift**: \n   - The most common shift used in Caesar ciphers is 3, but it could be any number from 1 to 25. \n   - We will try different shifts to see which one produces a coherent message.\n\n2. **Apply the Shift**:\n   - For each letter in the ciphertext, shift it backward by the determined number of places.\n   - If the shift goes past 'A', it wraps around to 'Z'.\n\n3. **Check for Coherence**:\n   - After applying a shift, check if the resulting text makes sense in English.\n   - Look for common words or phrases that indicate the correct decryption.\n\n4. **Iterate**:\n   - If the text is not coherent, try the next shift value and repeat the process.\n\n5. **Determine the Correct Shift**:\n   - Once a coherent message is found, that shift is likely the correct one.\n\n6. **Decrypt the Message**:\n   - Apply the correct shift to the entire ciphertext to get the plaintext.\n\nAfter applying these steps, the decrypted text is:\n\n<<<answer>>>PROBLEM SOLVING STRATEGIES AND TECHNIQUES EXPAND CONSIDERABLE EFFORT TO DO EXPLICIT RESEARCH TRANSCRIBE AND PROOFREAD WORKS NOT PROTECTED BY U."
