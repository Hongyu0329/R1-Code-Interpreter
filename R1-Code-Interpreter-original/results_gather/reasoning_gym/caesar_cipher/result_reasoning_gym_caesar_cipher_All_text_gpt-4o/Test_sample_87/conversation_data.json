    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used to encode the message. The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.\n\nLet's analyze the given text: \"YSOZN ZNXUAMN ZNK ZKRKVNUTK.\"\n\n1. **Identify the Shift:**\n   - The Caesar cipher involves shifting letters by a fixed number. We need to find this shift.\n   - A common approach is to look for common words or patterns. In English, \"THE\" is a very common word. In the cipher text, \"ZNK\" appears twice and could potentially be \"THE.\"\n\n2. **Calculate the Shift:**\n   - If \"ZNK\" is \"THE,\" we can calculate the shift:\n     - Z -> T: Shift of 6 backwards (Z is the 26th letter, T is the 20th, so 26 - 20 = 6)\n     - N -> H: Shift of 6 backwards (N is the 14th letter, H is the 8th, so 14 - 8 = 6)\n     - K -> E: Shift of 6 backwards (K is the 11th letter, E is the 5th, so 11 - 5 = 6)\n   - The shift is consistent, so we assume a shift of 6.\n\n3. **Decrypt the Text:**\n   - Apply the shift of 6 backwards to each letter in the cipher text:\n     - Y -> S\n     - S -> M\n     - O -> I\n     - Z -> T\n     - N -> H\n     - (Space remains a space)\n     - Z -> T\n     - N -> H\n     - X -> R\n     - U -> O\n     - A -> U\n     - M -> G\n     - N -> H\n     - (Space remains a space)\n     - Z -> T\n     - N -> H\n     - K -> E\n     - (Space remains a space)\n     - Z -> T\n     - K -> E\n     - R -> L\n     - K -> E\n     - V -> P\n     - N -> H\n     - U -> O\n     - T -> N\n     - K -> E\n\n4. **Construct the Decrypted Message:**\n   - After applying the shift, the decrypted message is: \"SMITH THOUGHT THE TELEPHONE.\"\n\nTherefore, the decrypted text is:\n\n<<<SMITH THOUGHT THE TELEPHONE>>>"
