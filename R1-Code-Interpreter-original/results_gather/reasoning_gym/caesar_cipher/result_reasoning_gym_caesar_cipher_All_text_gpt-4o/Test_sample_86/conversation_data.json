    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet. \n\nLet's analyze the given text: \"IYE UXYG RYG OKQOB SC DRO MEBSYCSDI YP DRO ZELVSM GSDR BOQKBN DY DROCO KCDBYXYWSMKV AEOCDSYXC.\"\n\n1. **Identify Common Patterns:**\n   - Look for common words or patterns that might give clues about the shift. For example, \"DRO\" appears multiple times and could be a common word like \"THE.\"\n\n2. **Assume \"DRO\" is \"THE\":**\n   - If \"DRO\" is \"THE\", then:\n     - D -> T\n     - R -> H\n     - O -> E\n\n3. **Calculate the Shift:**\n   - D (4th letter) to T (20th letter) is a shift of 16 places forward.\n   - R (18th letter) to H (8th letter) is a shift of 10 places backward.\n   - O (15th letter) to E (5th letter) is a shift of 10 places backward.\n\n   The consistent shift here is 10 places backward.\n\n4. **Apply the Shift:**\n   - Shift each letter in the text 10 places backward in the alphabet.\n   - For example, I (9th letter) shifted 10 places backward becomes Y (25th letter).\n\n5. **Decrypt the Entire Text:**\n   - Apply the shift to each letter in the text, keeping spaces and punctuation unchanged.\n\n6. **Verify the Decryption:**\n   - Ensure the decrypted text makes sense and is coherent.\n\nBy applying a backward shift of 10 to each letter, the decrypted text is:\n\n\"YOU MUST USE CAUTION IN THE EXECUTION OF THE PLAN THAT BEGINS IN THREE STAGES WITH THREE DIFFERENT OBJECTIVES.\"\n\nTherefore, the final decrypted text is:\n\n<<<YOU MUST USE CAUTION IN THE EXECUTION OF THE PLAN THAT BEGINS IN THREE STAGES WITH THREE DIFFERENT OBJECTIVES.>>>"
