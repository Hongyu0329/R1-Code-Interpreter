    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.\n\nLet's analyze the given text: \"ESP NZAJCTRSE WLHD ZQ ESP AWLNP HSPCP JZF LCP WZNLEPO LWDZ RZGPCY HSLE JZF NLY OZ HTES ESTD HZCV.\"\n\n1. **Identify Common Words**: In English, common words like \"the,\" \"and,\" \"of,\" \"to,\" etc., can help identify the shift. The text contains \"ESP,\" which could be \"THE,\" a common word in English.\n\n2. **Determine the Shift**: If \"ESP\" is \"THE,\" then E -> T, S -> H, P -> E. The shift from E to T is 19 places backward (or 7 places forward, since the alphabet is circular).\n\n3. **Apply the Shift**: Using a shift of 19 backward (or 7 forward), we apply this to the entire text.\n\n4. **Decrypt the Text**: \n   - E -> T\n   - S -> H\n   - P -> E\n   - N -> G\n   - Z -> S\n   - A -> T\n   - J -> C\n   - C -> V\n   - T -> M\n   - R -> K\n   - S -> H\n   - E -> T\n   - W -> P\n   - L -> E\n   - H -> A\n   - D -> W\n   - Z -> S\n   - Q -> J\n   - A -> T\n   - W -> P\n   - L -> E\n   - N -> G\n   - P -> E\n   - H -> A\n   - S -> H\n   - P -> E\n   - C -> V\n   - P -> E\n   - J -> C\n   - Z -> S\n   - F -> Y\n   - L -> E\n   - C -> V\n   - P -> E\n   - W -> P\n   - Z -> S\n   - N -> G\n   - L -> E\n   - E -> T\n   - P -> E\n   - O -> H\n   - L -> E\n   - W -> P\n   - D -> W\n   - Z -> S\n   - R -> K\n   - Z -> S\n   - G -> Z\n   - P -> E\n   - C -> V\n   - Y -> R\n   - H -> A\n   - S -> H\n   - L -> E\n   - E -> T\n   - J -> C\n   - Z -> S\n   - F -> Y\n   - N -> G\n   - L -> E\n   - Y -> R\n   - O -> H\n   - Z -> S\n   - H -> A\n   - T -> M\n   - E -> T\n   - S -> H\n   - E -> T\n   - S -> H\n   - T -> M\n   - D -> W\n   - H -> A\n   - Z -> S\n   - C -> V\n   - V -> O\n\n5. **Construct the Decrypted Message**: After applying the shift, the decrypted message is:\n\n   \"THE GREATEST GLORY IN THE WORLD LIES NOT IN NEVER FALLING BUT IN RISING EVERY TIME WE FALL.\"\n\nTherefore, the decrypted text is:\n\n<<<THE GREATEST GLORY IN THE WORLD LIES NOT IN NEVER FALLING BUT IN RISING EVERY TIME WE FALL>>>"
