    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. A Caesar cipher shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of places down the alphabet. The task is to reverse this process to retrieve the original message.\n\n1. **Identify the Shift**: \n   - The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.\n   - The most common shift used in Caesar ciphers is 3, but it can be any number from 1 to 25.\n\n2. **Decrypt the Text**:\n   - We will attempt to decrypt the text by shifting each letter backwards by 3 places, which is the most common shift.\n   - If the shift of 3 does not produce a sensible message, we would try other shifts from 1 to 25.\n\n3. **Apply the Shift**:\n   - For each letter in the ciphertext, shift it backwards by 3 places in the alphabet.\n   - If the shift goes past 'A', it wraps around to 'Z'.\n\n4. **Check for Sensibility**:\n   - After applying the shift, check if the resulting text makes sense in English.\n   - If it does, we have found the correct shift and decrypted the message.\n\n5. **Decrypt the Given Text**:\n   - Let's apply a shift of 3 to the given text: \"QH GKIJV JCF QPNA KORTCEVKECDNG UEJGOGU VQ RTQRQUG.\"\n\n   - Shift each letter backwards by 3:\n     - Q -> N\n     - H -> E\n     - G -> D\n     - K -> H\n     - I -> F\n     - J -> G\n     - V -> S\n     - J -> G\n     - C -> Z\n     - F -> C\n     - Q -> N\n     - P -> M\n     - N -> K\n     - A -> X\n     - K -> H\n     - O -> L\n     - R -> O\n     - T -> Q\n     - C -> Z\n     - E -> B\n     - V -> S\n     - K -> H\n     - E -> B\n     - C -> Z\n     - D -> A\n     - N -> K\n     - G -> D\n     - U -> R\n     - E -> B\n     - J -> G\n     - G -> D\n     - O -> L\n     - G -> D\n     - U -> R\n     - V -> S\n     - Q -> N\n     - R -> O\n     - T -> Q\n     - Q -> N\n     - U -> R\n     - G -> D\n\n   - The decrypted text is: \"NE DFGHS GZC NKMX HLOQZBSHBZKD RBDDRD SN NONOND.\"\n\n6. **Verify the Decrypted Text**:\n   - The decrypted text \"NE DFGHS GZC NKMX HLOQZBSHBZKD RBDDRD SN NONOND\" does not make sense, indicating that the shift of 3 is incorrect.\n   - We need to try other shifts until we find a sensible message.\n\n7. **Try Other Shifts**:\n   - Continue trying shifts from 1 to 25 until the decrypted text makes sense.\n   - After trying different shifts, a shift of 2 produces a sensible message.\n\n8. **Final Decrypted Message**:\n   - With a shift of 2, the decrypted message is: \"OF EIGHT HAD ONLY IMPLEMENTABLE SCHEMES TO PROPOSE.\"\n\nTherefore, the final decrypted text is:\n\n<<<answer>>>OF EIGHT HAD ONLY IMPLEMENTABLE SCHEMES TO PROPOSE.<<<answer>>>"
