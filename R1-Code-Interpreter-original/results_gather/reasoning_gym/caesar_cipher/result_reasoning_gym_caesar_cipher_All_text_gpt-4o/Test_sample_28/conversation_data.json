    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used to encode the message. A Caesar cipher shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of places down the alphabet. To decrypt, we reverse this shift.\n\nLet's analyze the given text: \"DKUO WO DY WI KMMEWEVKDYB GYBUC KD XSKQKBK.\"\n\n1. **Identify Common Patterns:**\n   - Look for common short words that might be easily recognizable. In English, common short words include \"the,\" \"and,\" \"is,\" \"in,\" \"it,\" etc.\n   - The word \"WO\" appears twice. It could potentially be \"is\" or \"in.\"\n\n2. **Frequency Analysis:**\n   - In a Caesar cipher, the frequency of letters remains unchanged. We can use this to guess the shift by comparing the frequency of letters in the cipher text to typical English letter frequencies.\n   - The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U.\n\n3. **Trial and Error:**\n   - Try different shifts to see if the text makes sense. Start with small shifts and adjust based on the appearance of recognizable words.\n\n4. **Decrypting:**\n   - Let's try a shift of 10, which is a common shift used in Caesar ciphers.\n   - Shift each letter in the cipher text 10 places back in the alphabet.\n\n5. **Apply the Shift:**\n   - D -> T\n   - K -> A\n   - U -> K\n   - O -> E\n   - W -> M\n   - O -> E\n   - D -> T\n   - Y -> O\n   - W -> M\n   - I -> Y\n   - K -> A\n   - M -> C\n   - M -> C\n   - E -> U\n   - W -> M\n   - E -> U\n   - V -> L\n   - K -> A\n   - D -> T\n   - Y -> O\n   - B -> R\n   - G -> W\n   - Y -> O\n   - B -> R\n   - U -> K\n   - C -> S\n   - K -> A\n   - D -> T\n   - X -> N\n   - S -> I\n   - K -> A\n   - Q -> G\n   - K -> A\n   - B -> R\n\n6. **Result:**\n   - The decrypted text is: \"TAKE ME TO MY ACCUMULATOR WORKS AT NIGHT.\"\n\nTherefore, the decrypted text is:\n\n<<<TAKE ME TO MY ACCUMULATOR WORKS AT NIGHT>>>"
