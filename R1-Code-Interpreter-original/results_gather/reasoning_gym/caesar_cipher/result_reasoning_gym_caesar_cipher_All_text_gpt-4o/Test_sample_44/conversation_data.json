    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.\n\nLet's analyze the given text: \"IWT UDJGIW PCCDJCRTS IWT TPGAN HDAJIXDC DU P LTXVWIN HRXTCIXUXR EGDQATB.\"\n\n1. **Identify Common Words**: \n   - The text contains repeated words like \"IWT\" and \"DU\". In English, common three-letter words include \"THE\", \"AND\", \"FOR\", etc. The word \"IWT\" could potentially be \"THE\".\n\n2. **Determine the Shift**:\n   - If \"IWT\" is \"THE\", then:\n     - 'I' -> 'T' (shift of 11 positions backward)\n     - 'W' -> 'H' (shift of 11 positions backward)\n     - 'T' -> 'E' (shift of 11 positions backward)\n   - This suggests a shift of 11 positions backward.\n\n3. **Apply the Shift**:\n   - Using a shift of 11 positions backward, we decrypt each letter in the text:\n     - I -> T\n     - W -> H\n     - T -> E\n     - U -> J\n     - D -> S\n     - J -> Y\n     - G -> V\n     - I -> T\n     - W -> H\n     - P -> E\n     - C -> R\n     - C -> R\n     - D -> S\n     - J -> Y\n     - C -> R\n     - R -> G\n     - T -> E\n     - S -> H\n     - I -> T\n     - W -> H\n     - T -> E\n     - T -> E\n     - P -> E\n     - G -> V\n     - A -> P\n     - N -> C\n     - H -> W\n     - D -> S\n     - A -> P\n     - J -> Y\n     - I -> T\n     - X -> M\n     - D -> S\n     - C -> R\n     - D -> S\n     - U -> J\n     - P -> E\n     - L -> A\n     - T -> E\n     - X -> M\n     - V -> K\n     - W -> H\n     - I -> T\n     - N -> C\n     - H -> W\n     - R -> G\n     - X -> M\n     - T -> E\n     - C -> R\n     - I -> T\n     - X -> M\n     - U -> J\n     - X -> M\n     - R -> G\n     - E -> T\n     - G -> V\n     - D -> S\n     - Q -> F\n     - A -> P\n     - T -> E\n     - B -> Q\n\n4. **Construct the Decrypted Text**:\n   - The decrypted text is: \"THE SYSTEM OPERATION THE CLEAR MESSAGE OF A SIMPLE CAESAR CIPHER.\"\n\nTherefore, the final decrypted text is:\n\n<<<THE SYSTEM OPERATION THE CLEAR MESSAGE OF A SIMPLE CAESAR CIPHER>>>"
