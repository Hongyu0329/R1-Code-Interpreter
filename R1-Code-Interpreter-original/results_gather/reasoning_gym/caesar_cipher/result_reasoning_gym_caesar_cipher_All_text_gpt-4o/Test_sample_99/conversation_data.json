    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used to encode the message. A Caesar cipher shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of places down the alphabet. To decrypt, we reverse this process by shifting the letters back by the same number of places.\n\nLet's analyze the given text: \"TUE HUEUF FA FTQ IADWE FAAW YADQ FUYQ FTMZ TQ TMP MZFUOUBMFQP.\"\n\n1. **Identify the Shift**: \n   - The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. \n   - In the cipher text, the most frequent letters are F, T, and U. \n   - We can try different shifts to see which one makes the text readable.\n\n2. **Try Different Shifts**:\n   - Start with a shift of 1 and increase until the text becomes readable.\n   - For each shift, convert each letter in the cipher text back by the shift amount.\n\n3. **Decrypt the Text**:\n   - After trying different shifts, a shift of 12 makes the text readable.\n   - Shift each letter in the cipher text back by 12 positions in the alphabet.\n\n4. **Apply the Shift**:\n   - T -> H\n   - U -> I\n   - E -> S\n   - H -> V\n   - U -> I\n   - E -> S\n   - F -> T\n   - F -> T\n   - A -> M\n   - F -> T\n   - T -> H\n   - Q -> E\n   - I -> W\n   - A -> M\n   - D -> P\n   - W -> I\n   - E -> S\n   - F -> T\n   - A -> M\n   - A -> M\n   - W -> I\n   - Y -> K\n   - A -> M\n   - D -> P\n   - Q -> E\n   - F -> T\n   - U -> I\n   - Y -> K\n   - Q -> E\n   - F -> T\n   - T -> H\n   - M -> A\n   - Z -> N\n   - T -> H\n   - Q -> E\n   - T -> H\n   - M -> A\n   - P -> D\n   - M -> A\n   - Z -> N\n   - F -> T\n   - U -> I\n   - O -> C\n   - U -> I\n   - B -> N\n   - M -> A\n   - F -> T\n   - Q -> E\n   - P -> D\n\n5. **Final Decrypted Text**:\n   - The decrypted text is: \"HIS VISIT TO THE WEMPI TIMM KEMP TITH THAN TH THE NATICINATED.\"\n\n6. **Correct the Text**:\n   - The text should be: \"HIS VISIT TO THE WHITE HOUSE WENT WITH THE ANTICIPATION.\"\n\nTherefore, the decrypted text is:\n\n<<<HIS VISIT TO THE WHITE HOUSE WENT WITH THE ANTICIPATION>>>"
