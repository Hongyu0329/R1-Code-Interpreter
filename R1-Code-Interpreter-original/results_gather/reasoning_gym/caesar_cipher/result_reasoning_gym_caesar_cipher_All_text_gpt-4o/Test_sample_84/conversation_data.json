    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used to encode the message. The Caesar cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.\n\n1. **Identify the Shift**: \n   - The most common letters in English are E, T, A, O, I, N, S, H, R, D, L, U. \n   - In the given cipher text, the most frequent letters are S, L, and A. \n   - We can try different shifts to see which one results in a coherent message.\n\n2. **Try Different Shifts**:\n   - Start with a shift of 1 and increase until a readable message is found.\n   - For each shift, replace each letter in the cipher text with the letter that is a certain number of places before it in the alphabet.\n\n3. **Decrypt the Message**:\n   - After trying different shifts, a shift of 18 (or -8) results in a coherent message.\n   - This means each letter in the cipher text is shifted 18 places back in the alphabet.\n\n4. **Apply the Shift**:\n   - E becomes M\n   - S becomes A\n   - F becomes N\n   - Q becomes I\n   - K becomes S\n   - And so on for the rest of the text.\n\n5. **Result**:\n   - After applying the shift, the decrypted message is: \"MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS SET CORRECTLY BEFORE STARTING TO MANIFEST THE POWER WITHIN YOURSELF AND THE KEY.\"\n\nThe final decrypted text is:\n\n<<<MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS SET CORRECTLY BEFORE STARTING TO MANIFEST THE POWER WITHIN YOURSELF AND THE KEY>>>"
