    "To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used to encode the message. A Caesar cipher shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of places down the alphabet. The key to decrypting the message is to find the correct shift value.\n\n1. **Identify the Nature of the Cipher**: The text is encrypted using a Caesar cipher, which means each letter is shifted by the same number of positions in the alphabet.\n\n2. **Analyze the Text**: The text is \"KV KU FGNKIJVHWN VJWU VQ VCMG DTGCMHCUV YKVJ QPG YJQ KU OKNGU QT UQ CYCA.\"\n\n3. **Look for Common Words**: In English, common short words like \"is,\" \"it,\" \"to,\" \"the,\" \"and,\" \"or,\" \"of,\" etc., can help identify the shift. The text contains \"KU,\" which could be \"IS\" or \"IT.\"\n\n4. **Determine the Shift**: \n   - If \"KU\" is \"IS,\" then K -> I and U -> S. The shift would be 2 positions backward.\n   - If \"KU\" is \"IT,\" then K -> I and U -> T. The shift would be 2 positions backward.\n\n5. **Apply the Shift**: With a shift of 2 positions backward, we decrypt each letter:\n   - K -> I\n   - V -> T\n   - F -> D\n   - G -> E\n   - N -> L\n   - K -> I\n   - I -> G\n   - J -> H\n   - V -> T\n   - H -> F\n   - W -> U\n   - N -> L\n   - V -> T\n   - J -> H\n   - W -> U\n   - U -> S\n   - V -> T\n   - Q -> O\n   - V -> T\n   - C -> A\n   - M -> K\n   - G -> E\n   - D -> B\n   - T -> R\n   - G -> E\n   - C -> A\n   - M -> K\n   - H -> F\n   - C -> A\n   - U -> S\n   - V -> T\n   - Y -> W\n   - K -> I\n   - V -> T\n   - J -> H\n   - Q -> O\n   - P -> N\n   - G -> E\n   - Y -> W\n   - J -> H\n   - Q -> O\n   - K -> I\n   - U -> S\n   - O -> M\n   - K -> I\n   - N -> L\n   - G -> E\n   - U -> S\n   - Q -> O\n   - T -> R\n   - U -> S\n   - Q -> O\n   - C -> A\n   - Y -> W\n   - C -> A\n   - A -> Y\n\n6. **Construct the Decrypted Message**: After applying the shift, the decrypted message is:\n   \"IT IS DELIGHTFUL JUST TO TAKE BREAKFAST WITH ONE WHO IS MILES OR SO AWAY.\"\n\n7. **Output the Final Answer**: The decrypted text is:\n\n<<<IT IS DELIGHTFUL JUST TO TAKE BREAKFAST WITH ONE WHO IS MILES OR SO AWAY>>>"
