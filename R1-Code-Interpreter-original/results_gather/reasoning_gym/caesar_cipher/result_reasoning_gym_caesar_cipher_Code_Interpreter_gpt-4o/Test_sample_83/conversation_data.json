    "\nassistant > To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. The text \"DOLYL OHCL FVB HZRLK TY\" appears to be shifted by a certain number of positions in the alphabet. A common approach is to try all possible shifts (from 1 to 25) and see which one results in a meaningful message.\n\nLet's try decrypting the text by shifting each letter backwards in the alphabet and see which shift gives us a coherent message.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef caesar_decrypt(ciphertext, shift):\r\n    decrypted_text = \"\"\r\n    for char in ciphertext:\r\n        if char.isalpha():\r\n            shift_amount = shift % 26\r\n            new_char = chr(((ord(char) - 65 - shift_amount) % 26) + 65)\r\n            decrypted_text += new_char\r\n        else:\r\n            decrypted_text += char\r\n    return decrypted_text\r\n\r\nciphertext = \"DOLYL OHCL FVB HZRLK TY\"\r\n# Try all possible shifts from 1 to 25\r\npossible_decryptions = [caesar_decrypt(ciphertext, shift) for shift in range(1, 26)]\r\npossible_decryptions\nassistant > The decrypted text with a meaningful message is obtained with a shift of 7:\n\n<<<WHERE HAVE YOU ASKED MR>>>"
