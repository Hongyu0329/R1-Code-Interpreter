    "\nassistant > To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. The text \"BM BL MAX WTR YHK MAX KXMNKG MH EBYX HY MAX YTFHNL WK\" appears to be encrypted with a shift. A common approach is to try all possible shifts (from 1 to 25) and see which one results in a meaningful sentence.\n\nLet's try decrypting the text with all possible shifts and identify the correct one.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef caesar_decrypt(ciphertext, shift):\n    decrypted_text = \"\"\n    for char in ciphertext:\n        if char.isalpha():\n            shift_amount = shift if char.isupper() else shift\n            new_char = chr((ord(char) - shift_amount - 65) % 26 + 65)\n            decrypted_text += new_char\n        else:\n            decrypted_text += char\n    return decrypted_text\n\nciphertext = \"BM BL MAX WTR YHK MAX KXMNKG MH EBYX HY MAX YTFHNL WK\"\n\n# Try all possible shifts\npossible_decryptions = [caesar_decrypt(ciphertext, shift) for shift in range(26)]\n\n# Find the most meaningful sentence\npossible_decryptions\nassistant > The decrypted text with a meaningful sentence is found with a shift of 18:\n\n<<<IT IS THE DAY FOR THE RETURN TO LIFE OF THE FAMOUS DR>>>"
