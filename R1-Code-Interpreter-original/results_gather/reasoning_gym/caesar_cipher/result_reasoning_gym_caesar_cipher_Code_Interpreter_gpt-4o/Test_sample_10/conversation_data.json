    "\nassistant > To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. The text \"JNJUBUF ZPVS BTTPDJBUF XIPN J XBT DPNQMJNFOUJOH B NPNFOU BHP\" appears to be shifted by 1 letter forward. Let's decrypt it by shifting each letter 1 position backward in the alphabet.\n\nDecrypted text: \"IMAGINE YOUR ASSOCIATE WHOM I WAS COMPLIMENTING A MOMENT AGO\"\n\nThe decrypted text is:\n\n<<<IMAGINE YOUR ASSOCIATE WHOM I WAS COMPLIMENTING A MOMENT AGO>>>"
