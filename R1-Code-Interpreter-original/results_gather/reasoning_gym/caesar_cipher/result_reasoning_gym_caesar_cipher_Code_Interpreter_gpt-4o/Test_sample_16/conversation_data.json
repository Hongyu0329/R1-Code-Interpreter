    "\nassistant > To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. The text \"ESP NZAJCTRSE WLHD ZQ ESP AWLNP HSPCP JZF LCP WZNLEPO LWDZ RZGPCY HSLE JZF NLY OZ HTES ESTD HZCV\" appears to be shifted by a certain number of positions in the alphabet. \n\nA common approach is to try a shift of 4, as \"ESP\" could be \"THE\", which is a common word in English.
