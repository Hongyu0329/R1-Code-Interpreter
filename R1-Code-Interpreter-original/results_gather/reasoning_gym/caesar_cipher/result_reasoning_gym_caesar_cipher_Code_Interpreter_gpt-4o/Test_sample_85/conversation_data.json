    "\nassistant > To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. The most common shift is 13, but it could be any number from 1 to 25. Let's try decrypting the text by shifting each letter backwards by 13 positions, which is a common shift used in Caesar ciphers (also known as ROT13).
