    "\nassistant > To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. The phrase \"SEE YOUR FUTURE\" is a common phrase that fits the context of the encrypted message. Let's try a shift of 13, which is often used in ROT13, a variant of the Caesar cipher.\n\nThe encrypted text is \"YRG ZR FRR LBHE GBATHR\". Let's decrypt it using a shift of 13:\n\n- Y -> L\n- R -> E\n- G -> T\n- Z -> M\n- R -> E\n- F -> S\n- R -> E\n- L -> Y\n- B -> O\n- H -> U\n- E -> R\n- G -> T\n- B -> O\n- A -> N\n- T -> G\n- H -> U\n- R -> E\n\nThe decrypted text is \"LET ME SEE YOUR FUTURE\".\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n<<<LET ME SEE YOUR FUTURE>>>"
