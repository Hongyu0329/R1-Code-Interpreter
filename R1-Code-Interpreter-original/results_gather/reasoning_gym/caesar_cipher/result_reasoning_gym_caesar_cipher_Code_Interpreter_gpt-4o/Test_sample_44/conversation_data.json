    "\nassistant > To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.\n\nIn this case, we can try a few common shifts to see if we can find a meaningful decryption. A common shift used in Caesar ciphers is 3, but we will try different shifts to find the correct one.\n\nLet's try decrypting the text with different shifts and see if we can find the correct decryption.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef caesar_decrypt(ciphertext, shift):\n    decrypted_text = \"\"\n    for char in ciphertext:\n        if char.isalpha():\n            shift_amount = shift % 26\n            shifted = ord(char) - shift_amount\n            if char.isupper():\n                if shifted < ord('A'):\n                    shifted += 26\n            elif char.islower():\n                if shifted < ord('a'):\n                    shifted += 26\n            decrypted_text += chr(shifted)\n        else:\n            decrypted_text += char\n    return decrypted_text\n\nciphertext = \"IWT UDJGIW PCCDJCRTS IWT TPGAN HDAJIXDC DU P LTXVWIN HRXTCIXUXR EGDQATB.\"\n\n# Try different shifts to find the correct decryption\npossible_decryptions = [caesar_decrypt(ciphertext, shift) for shift in range(1, 26)]\n\npossible_decryptions\nassistant > The decrypted text with a shift of 15 is meaningful:\n\n<<<THE FOURTH ANNOUNCED THE EARLY SOLUTION OF A WEIGHTY SCIENTIFIC PROBLEM.>>>"
