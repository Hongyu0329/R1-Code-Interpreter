    "\nassistant > To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift value used for encryption. The text \"TUE HUEUF FA FTQ IADWE FAAW YADQ FUYQ FTMZ TQ TMP MZFUOUBMFQP\" appears to be shifted by a certain number of positions in the alphabet. We will try different shift values to find the one that results in a meaningful English sentence.\n\nLet's try decrypting the text with different shift values.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef caesar_decrypt(ciphertext, shift):\r\n    decrypted_text = \"\"\r\n    for char in ciphertext:\r\n        if char.isalpha():\r\n            shift_amount = shift % 26\r\n            shifted = ord(char) - shift_amount\r\n            if char.isupper():\r\n                if shifted < ord('A'):\r\n                    shifted += 26\r\n            elif char.islower():\r\n                if shifted < ord('a'):\r\n                    shifted += 26\r\n            decrypted_text += chr(shifted)\r\n        else:\r\n            decrypted_text += char\r\n    return decrypted_text\r\n\r\nciphertext = \"TUE HUEUF FA FTQ IADWE FAAW YADQ FUYQ FTMZ TQ TMP MZFUOUBMFQP\"\r\n\r\n# Try all possible shifts (1 to 25) to find the correct decryption\r\npossible_decryptions = [caesar_decrypt(ciphertext, shift) for shift in range(1, 26)]\r\npossible_decryptions\nassistant > The decrypted text with a meaningful English sentence is found with a shift of 11:\n\n<<<HIS VISIT TO THE WORKS TOOK MORE TIME THAN HE HAD ANTICIPATED>>>"
