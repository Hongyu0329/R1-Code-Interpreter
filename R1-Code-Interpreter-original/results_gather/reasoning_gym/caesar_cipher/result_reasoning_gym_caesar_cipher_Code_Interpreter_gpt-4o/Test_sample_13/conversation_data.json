    "\nassistant > To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. The phrase \"WG DFCUFSGG SJSFMKVSFS SLQSDH AIHHSFSR AF\" appears to be encrypted with a shift. A common approach is to try all possible shifts (from 1 to 25) and see which one results in a meaningful message.\n\nLet's try decrypting this text by applying all possible shifts and see which one makes sense.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef caesar_decrypt(ciphertext, shift):\n    decrypted_text = \"\"\n    for char in ciphertext:\n        if char.isalpha():\n            shift_amount = 65 if char.isupper() else 97\n            decrypted_text += chr((ord(char) - shift_amount - shift) % 26 + shift_amount)\n        else:\n            decrypted_text += char\n    return decrypted_text\n\nciphertext = \"WG DFCUFSGG SJSFMKVSFS SLQSDH AIHHSFSR AF\"\npossible_decryptions = [caesar_decrypt(ciphertext, shift) for shift in range(26)]\npossible_decryptions\nassistant > The decrypted text with a meaningful message is found with a shift of 14:\n\n<<<PROGRESS EVERYWHERE EXCEPT MUTTERED MR>>>"
