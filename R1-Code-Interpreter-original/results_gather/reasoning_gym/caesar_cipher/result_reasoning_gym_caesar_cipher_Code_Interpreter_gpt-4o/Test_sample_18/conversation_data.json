    "\nassistant > To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. The text \"QXF UXWP QJB QN KNNW MA\" appears to be shifted by a certain number of positions in the alphabet. A common approach is to try all possible shifts (from 1 to 25) and see which one produces a meaningful message.\n\nLet's try decrypting this text by shifting the letters backward and see which shift gives us a coherent message.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef caesar_decrypt(ciphertext, shift):\n    decrypted_text = \"\"\n    for char in ciphertext:\n        if char.isalpha():\n            shifted = ord(char) - shift\n            if char.isupper():\n                if shifted < ord('A'):\n                    shifted += 26\n            elif char.islower():\n                if shifted < ord('a'):\n                    shifted += 26\n            decrypted_text += chr(shifted)\n        else:\n            decrypted_text += char\n    return decrypted_text\n\nciphertext = \"QXF UXWP QJB QN KNNW MA\"\n# Try all possible shifts from 1 to 25\npossible_decryptions = [caesar_decrypt(ciphertext, shift) for shift in range(1, 26)]\npossible_decryptions\nassistant > The decrypted text with a meaningful message is found with a shift of 8:\n\n<<<HOW LONG HAS HE BEEN DR>>>"
