    "\nassistant > To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. The text \"WMS KSQR AMKC YLB QCC\" appears to be a simple Caesar cipher, which typically uses a shift of 3. Let's try decrypting it with a shift of 3 and see if it makes sense. \n\nThe decryption process involves shifting each letter in the text backward by the shift amount. Let's perform the decryption.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef caesar_decrypt(ciphertext, shift):\n    decrypted_text = \"\"\n    for char in ciphertext:\n        if char.isalpha():\n            shift_amount = shift % 26\n            new_char = chr((ord(char) - shift_amount - 65) % 26 + 65)\n            decrypted_text += new_char\n        else:\n            decrypted_text += char\n    return decrypted_text\n\nciphertext = \"WMS KSQR AMKC YLB QCC\"\nshift = 4  # Trying a shift of 4\ndecrypted_text = caesar_decrypt(ciphertext, shift)\ndecrypted_text\nassistant > The decrypted text with a shift of 4 is \"SIO GOMN WIGY UHX MYY\". However, this doesn't seem to make sense. Let's try a different shift value. \n\nI'll try a shift of 8, as it might be a more appropriate shift for this text.# Trying a shift of 8\nshift = 8\ndecrypted_text = caesar_decrypt(ciphertext, shift)\ndecrypted_text\nassistant > The decrypted text with a shift of 8 is \"OEK CKIJ SECU QDT IUU\".

Let's try a shift of 14, as it might be a more appropriate shift for this text.# Trying a shift of 14\nshift = 14\ndecrypted_text = caesar_decrypt(ciphertext, shift)\ndecrypted_text\nassistant > The decrypted text with a shift of 14 is \"IYE WECD MYWO KXN COO\". This still doesn't seem to make sense. Let's try a shift of 18, as it might be a more appropriate shift for this text.# Trying a shift of 18\nshift = 18\ndecrypted_text = caesar_decrypt(ciphertext, shift)\ndecrypted_text\nassistant > The decrypted text with a shift of 18 is \"EUA SAYZ IUSK GTJ YKK\".

Let's try a shift of 20, as it might be a more appropriate shift for this text.# Trying a shift of 20\nshift = 20\ndecrypted_text = caesar_decrypt(ciphertext, shift)\ndecrypted_text\nassistant > The decrypted text with a shift of 20 is \"CSY QYWX GSQI ERH WII\". This still doesn't seem to make sense. Let's try a shift of 22, as it might be a more appropriate shift for this text.# Trying a shift of 22\nshift = 22\ndecrypted_text = caesar_decrypt(ciphertext, shift)\ndecrypted_text\nassistant > The decrypted text with a shift of 22 is \"AQW OWUV EQOG CPF UGG\". This still doesn't seem to make sense. Let's try a shift of 24, as it might be a more appropriate shift for this text.# Trying a shift of 24\nshift = 24\ndecrypted_text = caesar_decrypt(ciphertext, shift)\ndecrypted_text\nassistant > The decrypted text with a shift of 24 is \"YOU MUST COME AND SEE\". \n\nThe decrypted message is: <<<YOU MUST COME AND SEE>>>"
