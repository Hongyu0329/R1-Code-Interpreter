The text \"TBJO MVY AOHA LEWLYPTLUA\" appears to be shifted by a certain number of positions in the alphabet. \n\nLet's try to decrypt it by shifting the letters back by a common shift value, such as 7, which is often used in Caesar ciphers. \n\nLet's decrypt the text.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef caesar_decrypt(ciphertext, shift):\n    decrypted_text = \"\"\n    for char in ciphertext:\n        if char.isalpha():\n            shift_amount = shift % 26\n            shifted = ord(char) - shift_amount\n            if char.isupper():\n                if shifted < ord('A'):\n                    shifted += 26\n            elif char.islower():\n                if shifted < ord('a'):\n                    shifted += 26\n            decrypted_text += chr(shifted)\n        else:\n            decrypted_text += char\n    return decrypted_text\n\nciphertext = \"TBJO MVY AOHA LEWLYPTLUA\"\nshift = 7\ndecrypted_text = caesar_decrypt(ciphertext, shift)\ndecrypted_text\nassistant > <<<MUCH FOR THAT EXPERIMENT>>>"
