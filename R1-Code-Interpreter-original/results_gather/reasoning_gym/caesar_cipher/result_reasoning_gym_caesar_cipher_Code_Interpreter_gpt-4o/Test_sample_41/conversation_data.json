    "\nassistant > To decrypt the Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. The text \"LI AEW NYWX JMRMWLMRK XLI HIWWIVX ALIR QVW\" appears to be shifted by a certain number of positions in the alphabet. \n\nA common approach is to try all possible shifts (from 1 to 25) and see which one results in a meaningful English sentence.
