    "\nassistant > To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. The phrase \"PDA YKIEJC KB IN\" seems to be a simple Caesar cipher, which typically uses a shift of 3. Let's try decrypting it with a shift of 3 and see if it makes sense.\n\nThe Caesar cipher decryption formula is:\n\\[ \\text{Decrypted character} = (\\text{Encrypted character} - \\text{Shift}) \\mod "
