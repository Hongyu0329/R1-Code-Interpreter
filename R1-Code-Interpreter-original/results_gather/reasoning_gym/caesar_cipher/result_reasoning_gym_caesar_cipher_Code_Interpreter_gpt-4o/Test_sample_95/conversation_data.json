    "\nassistant > To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. The text \"U ECHA CM BY\" seems to be a simple Caesar cipher, which typically uses a shift of 3. Let's try decrypting it with a shift of 3 and see if it makes sense. \n\nThe decryption process involves shifting each letter in the text backward by the shift amount.
