    "\nassistant > To decrypt a Caesar cipher, we need to determine the shift used in the encryption. The text \"OG WB HVS HVS OBR KSFS GIDDZWSR HVFCIUV HVS\" seems to have a repeated pattern, which suggests a common word or phrase. The word \"HVS\" appears frequently, which could be \"THE\" in English, a common word.\n\nIf \"HVS\" is \"THE\", then the shift is calculated as follows:\n- H -> T (shift of 12)\n- V -> H (shift of 14)\n- S -> E (shift of 14)\n\nThe most consistent shift here is 14. Let's apply a shift of 14 to the entire text to decrypt it.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef caesar_decrypt(ciphertext, shift):\n    decrypted_text = \"\"\n    for char in ciphertext:\n        if char.isalpha():\n            shifted = ord(char) - shift\n            if char.isupper():\n                if shifted < ord('A'):\n                    shifted += 26\n                decrypted_text += chr(shifted)\n            else:\n                if shifted < ord('a'):\n                    shifted += 26\n                decrypted_text += chr(shifted)\n        else:\n            decrypted_text += char\n    return decrypted_text\n\nciphertext = \"OG WB HVS HVS OBR KSFS GIDDZWSR HVFCIUV HVS\"\nshift = 14\ndecrypted_text = caesar_decrypt(ciphertext, shift)\ndecrypted_text\nassistant > <<<AS IN THE THE AND WERE SUPPLIED THROUGH THE>>>"
