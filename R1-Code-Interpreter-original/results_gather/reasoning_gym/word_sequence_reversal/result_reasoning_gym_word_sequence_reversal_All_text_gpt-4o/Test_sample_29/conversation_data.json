    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List of Words**: The list of words given is: \"simply, has, Yes, them, coming, years\".\n\n2. **Understand the Task**: The task is to reverse the order of the words in the list. This means the first word will become the last, the second word will become the second last, and so on.\n\n3. **List the Words in Order**: \n   - First word: \"simply\"\n   - Second word: \"has\"\n   - Third word: \"Yes\"\n   - Fourth word: \"them\"\n   - Fifth word: \"coming\"\n   - Sixth word: \"years\"\n\n4. **Reverse the Order**: \n   - The last word \"years\" will become the first.\n   - The second last word \"coming\" will become the second.\n   - The third last word \"them\" will become the third.\n   - The fourth last word \"Yes\" will become the fourth.\n   - The fifth last word \"has\" will become the fifth.\n   - The first word \"simply\" will become the last.\n\n5. **Construct the Reversed List**: The reversed list of words is: \"years, coming, them, Yes, has, simply\".\n\n6. **Format the Answer**: The final answer should be formatted as a comma-separated list of words with a space after each comma, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the final answer:\n\n<<<years, coming, them, Yes, has, simply>>>"
