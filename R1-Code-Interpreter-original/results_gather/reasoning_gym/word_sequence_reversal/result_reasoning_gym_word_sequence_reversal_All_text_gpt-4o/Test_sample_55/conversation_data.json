    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List of Words**: The list provided is \"he, including, science, advanced\".\n\n2. **Understand the Task**: We are required to reverse the order of the words in the list. This means the last word should come first, and the first word should come last.\n\n3. **List the Words in Order**: \n   - First word: \"he\"\n   - Second word: \"including\"\n   - Third word: \"science\"\n   - Fourth word: \"advanced\"\n\n4. **Reverse the Order**: \n   - The last word \"advanced\" should come first.\n   - The third word \"science\" should come second.\n   - The second word \"including\" should come third.\n   - The first word \"he\" should come last.\n\n5. **Create the Reversed List**: \n   - The reversed order of the words is: \"advanced\", \"science\", \"including\", \"he\".\n\n6. **Format the Answer**: \n   - The answer should be formatted as a comma-separated list of words with a space after each comma, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the final answer:\n\n<<<advanced, science, including, he>>>"
