    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List of Words**: The list provided is: \"of, 1100, us, specifically, can, Project, Fritz\".\n\n2. **Understand the Order**: The words are currently in the order they are listed. Our task is to reverse this order.\n\n3. **Reverse the List**: To reverse the list, we start from the last word and move to the first. The reversed order will be: \"Fritz, Project, can, specifically, us, 1100, of\".\n\n4. **Format the Answer**: The problem specifies that the answer should be a comma-separated list of words with a space after each comma, and it should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\n5. **Verify the Reversal**: Double-check to ensure that the list is correctly reversed and formatted as required.\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that the list is accurately reversed and presented in the correct format.\n\nThe final reversed list of words is:\n\n<<<Fritz, Project, can, specifically, us, 1100, of>>>"
