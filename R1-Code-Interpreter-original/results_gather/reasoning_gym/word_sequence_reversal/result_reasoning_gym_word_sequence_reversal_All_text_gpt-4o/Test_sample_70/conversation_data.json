    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List of Words**: The list of words given is: \"by, Neptune, muttered, in\".\n\n2. **Understand the Order**: The words are currently in the order they are listed: \n   - First word: \"by\"\n   - Second word: \"Neptune\"\n   - Third word: \"muttered\"\n   - Fourth word: \"in\"\n\n3. **Reverse the Order**: To reverse the list, we need to rearrange the words in the opposite order:\n   - First word in the reversed list: \"in\"\n   - Second word in the reversed list: \"muttered\"\n   - Third word in the reversed list: \"Neptune\"\n   - Fourth word in the reversed list: \"by\"\n\n4. **Format the Answer**: The final step is to format the reversed list as a comma-separated list of words with a space after each comma, and enclose it within triple angle brackets.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the reversed list of words.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<in, muttered, Neptune, by>>>"
