    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List of Words**: The list of words given is: \"the, follow, Celestial, again, of\".\n\n2. **Understand the Task**: The task is to reverse the order of these words. This means the last word in the original list should become the first word in the reversed list, the second last word should become the second word in the reversed list, and so on.\n\n3. **Reversing the List**:\n   - The original order is: \"the, follow, Celestial, again, of\".\n   - Reverse the order:\n     - The last word \"of\" becomes the first.\n     - The second last word \"again\" becomes the second.\n     - The middle word \"Celestial\" remains in the middle.\n     - The second word \"follow\" becomes the second last.\n     - The first word \"the\" becomes the last.\n\n4. **Construct the Reversed List**: After reversing, the list of words should be: \"of, again, Celestial, follow, the\".\n\n5. **Format the Answer**: The final step is to format the reversed list as a comma-separated list of words with a space after each comma, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the final answer:\n\n<<<of, again, Celestial, follow, the>>>"
