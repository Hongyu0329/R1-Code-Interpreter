    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List of Words**: The list of words given is: \"can, IN, Smith, and, extensive\".\n\n2. **Understand the Task**: We are required to reverse the order of these words. This means the last word in the original list should become the first word in the reversed list, the second last word should become the second word, and so on.\n\n3. **List the Words in Order**: \n   - Original order: can, IN, Smith, and, extensive\n\n4. **Reverse the Order**: \n   - Start with the last word and move to the first:\n     - extensive\n     - and\n     - Smith\n     - IN\n     - can\n\n5. **Format the Answer**: The reversed list should be presented as a comma-separated list of words, with a space after each comma, and enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\n6. **Construct the Final Answer**: \n   - The reversed list is: extensive, and, Smith, IN, can\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that the list is correctly reversed and formatted as required.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<extensive, and, Smith, IN, can>>>"
