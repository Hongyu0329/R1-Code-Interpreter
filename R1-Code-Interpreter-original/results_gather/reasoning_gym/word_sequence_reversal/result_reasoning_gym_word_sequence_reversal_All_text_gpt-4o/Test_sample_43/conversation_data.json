    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List of Words**: \n   - The given list of words is: \"the, must, still, laws, agreement, scientific\".\n\n2. **Understand the Task**:\n   - We are required to reverse the order of the words in the list.\n\n3. **Reverse the Order**:\n   - The original order is: \"the\", \"must\", \"still\", \"laws\", \"agreement\", \"scientific\".\n   - Reversing this order means the last word becomes the first, the second last becomes the second, and so on.\n\n4. **List the Words in Reverse Order**:\n   - Start with the last word and move to the first:\n     - \"scientific\" (originally last)\n     - \"agreement\" (originally second last)\n     - \"laws\" (originally third last)\n     - \"still\" (originally third)\n     - \"must\" (originally second)\n     - \"the\" (originally first)\n\n5. **Format the Answer**:\n   - The reversed list of words should be presented as a comma-separated list with a space after each comma, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the final reversed list of words.\n\nThe reversed list of words is: <<<scientific, agreement, laws, still, must, the>>>."
