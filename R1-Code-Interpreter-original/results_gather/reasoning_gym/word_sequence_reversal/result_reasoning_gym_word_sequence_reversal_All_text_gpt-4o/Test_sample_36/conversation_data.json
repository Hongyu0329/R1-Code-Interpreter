    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Task**: We are given a list of words and need to reverse the order of these words.\n\n2. **Identify the List**: The list of words provided is:\n   - electronic\n   - the\n   - light\n   - network\n   - sentence\n   - codes\n   - were\n   - having\n\n3. **Reverse the Order**: To reverse the list, we start from the last word and move to the first word. The reversed order will be:\n   - having\n   - were\n   - codes\n   - sentence\n   - network\n   - light\n   - the\n   - electronic\n\n4. **Format the Answer**: The final step is to format the reversed list as a comma-separated list of words, with a space after each comma, and enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the final answer:\n\n<<<having, were, codes, sentence, network, light, the, electronic>>>"
