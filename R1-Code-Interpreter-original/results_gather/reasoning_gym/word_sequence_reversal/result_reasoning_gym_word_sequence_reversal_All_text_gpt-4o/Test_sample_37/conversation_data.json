    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List of Words**: The list provided is: \"inventors, 25th, no, interesting, certainly, I, at, copyright\".\n\n2. **Understand the Task**: The task is to reverse the order of the words in the list. This means the first word will become the last, the second word will become the second last, and so on.\n\n3. **Reversing the List**: We will take the list and reverse the order of the words. The original order is:\n   - inventors\n   - 25th\n   - no\n   - interesting\n   - certainly\n   - I\n   - at\n   - copyright\n\n   Reversing this order, we get:\n   - copyright\n   - at\n   - I\n   - certainly\n   - interesting\n   - no\n   - 25th\n   - inventors\n\n4. **Formatting the Answer**: The final step is to format the reversed list as a comma-separated list of words with a space after each comma, and enclose it within triple angle brackets.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the final answer:\n\n<<<copyright, at, I, certainly, interesting, no, 25th, inventors>>>"
