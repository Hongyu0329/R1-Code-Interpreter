    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words, we need to follow a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Understand the Input**: The input is a list of words: \"by, people, follow, the, the, When, THE\".\n\n2. **Identify the Order**: The words are currently in the order they are listed. Our task is to reverse this order.\n\n3. **Reverse the List**: To reverse the list, we start from the last word and move to the first word. The original order is:\n   - by\n   - people\n   - follow\n   - the\n   - the\n   - When\n   - THE\n\n   Reversing this order gives us:\n   - THE\n   - When\n   - the\n   - the\n   - follow\n   - people\n   - by\n\n4. **Format the Output**: The problem specifies that the answer should be provided as a comma-separated list of words, with a space after each comma, and enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\n5. **Construct the Final Answer**: Based on the reversed order, the final answer should be formatted as follows:\n   - THE, When, the, the, follow, people, by\n\n6. **Enclose in Triple Angle Brackets**: Finally, we enclose the formatted list within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<THE, When, the, the, follow, people, by>>>"
