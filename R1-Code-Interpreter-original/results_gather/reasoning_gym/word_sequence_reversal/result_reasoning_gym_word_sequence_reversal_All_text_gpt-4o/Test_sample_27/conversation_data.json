    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List of Words**: The list provided is \"him, of, time, during\".\n\n2. **Understand the Order**: The words are currently in the order: \n   - First word: \"him\"\n   - Second word: \"of\"\n   - Third word: \"time\"\n   - Fourth word: \"during\"\n\n3. **Reverse the Order**: To reverse the list, we need to change the order of the words such that the last word becomes the first, and the first word becomes the last. The reversed order will be:\n   - First word: \"during\"\n   - Second word: \"time\"\n   - Third word: \"of\"\n   - Fourth word: \"him\"\n\n4. **Format the Answer**: The final step is to format the reversed list as a comma-separated list of words with a space after each comma, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the reversed list of words.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<during, time, of, him>>>"
