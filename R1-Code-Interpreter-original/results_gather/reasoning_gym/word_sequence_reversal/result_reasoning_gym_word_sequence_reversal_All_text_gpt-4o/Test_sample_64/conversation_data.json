    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List of Words**: The list of words given is: \"think, work, can, this, are\".\n\n2. **Understand the Task**: The task is to reverse the order of these words. This means the last word in the original list should become the first word in the reversed list, the second last word should become the second word, and so on.\n\n3. **List the Words in Order**: \n   - Original order: think, work, can, this, are\n\n4. **Reverse the Order**: \n   - Start with the last word and move to the first:\n     - 1st word in reversed list: are\n     - 2nd word in reversed list: this\n     - 3rd word in reversed list: can\n     - 4th word in reversed list: work\n     - 5th word in reversed list: think\n\n5. **Format the Answer**: The reversed list should be presented as a comma-separated list of words, with a space after each comma, and enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\n6. **Final Answer**: Combine the reversed words into the required format.\n\nThe reversed list of words is: <<<are, this, can, work, think>>>."
