    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Task**: We are given a list of words and asked to reverse the order of these words. The words are: \"a\", \"so\", \"cannot\", \"BE\", \"gone\", \"more\", \"mere\", \"mercy\".\n\n2. **List the Words**: The original list of words is:\n   - a\n   - so\n   - cannot\n   - BE\n   - gone\n   - more\n   - mere\n   - mercy\n\n3. **Reverse the Order**: To reverse the list, we need to start from the last word and move to the first. The reversed order will be:\n   - mercy\n   - mere\n   - more\n   - gone\n   - BE\n   - cannot\n   - so\n   - a\n\n4. **Format the Answer**: The final step is to format the reversed list as a comma-separated list of words, with a space after each comma, and enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the final answer:\n\n<<<mercy, mere, more, gone, BE, cannot, so, a>>>"
