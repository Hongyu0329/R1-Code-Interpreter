    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List of Words**: The list provided is \"at, into, least, as\".\n\n2. **Understand the Task**: We are required to reverse the order of the words in the list. This means the first word will become the last, the second word will become the second last, and so on.\n\n3. **List the Words**: \n   - First word: \"at\"\n   - Second word: \"into\"\n   - Third word: \"least\"\n   - Fourth word: \"as\"\n\n4. **Reverse the Order**: \n   - The last word \"as\" will become the first.\n   - The third word \"least\" will become the second.\n   - The second word \"into\" will become the third.\n   - The first word \"at\" will become the last.\n\n5. **Construct the Reversed List**: The reversed order of the words is \"as, least, into, at\".\n\n6. **Format the Answer**: The final answer should be presented as a comma-separated list of words with a space after each comma, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the final answer:\n\n<<<as, least, into, at>>>"
