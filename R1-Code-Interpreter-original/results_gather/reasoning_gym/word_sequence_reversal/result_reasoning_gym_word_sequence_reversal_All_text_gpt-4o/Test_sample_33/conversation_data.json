    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List of Words**: The list provided is: \"are, are, state, that, or, reported\".\n\n2. **Understand the Task**: The task is to reverse the order of the words in the list. This means the first word will become the last, the second word will become the second last, and so on.\n\n3. **Reversing the List**: \n   - Start with the last word and move to the first.\n   - The original order is: \"are, are, state, that, or, reported\".\n   - Reversing this order gives us: \"reported, or, that, state, are, are\".\n\n4. **Formatting the Answer**: \n   - The answer should be a comma-separated list of words.\n   - There should be a space after each comma.\n   - The entire list should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\n5. **Final Answer**: Based on the reversed order and the required format, the final answer is:\n\n<<<reported, or, that, state, are, are>>>"
