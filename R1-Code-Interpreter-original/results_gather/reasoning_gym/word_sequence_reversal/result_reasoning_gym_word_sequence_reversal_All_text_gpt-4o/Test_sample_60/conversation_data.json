    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List of Words**: The list of words given is: \"can, of, attends, donations, the, better\".\n\n2. **Understand the Task**: The task is to reverse the order of these words. This means the first word will become the last, the second word will become the second last, and so on.\n\n3. **List the Words in Order**: \n   - First word: can\n   - Second word: of\n   - Third word: attends\n   - Fourth word: donations\n   - Fifth word: the\n   - Sixth word: better\n\n4. **Reverse the Order**: \n   - The last word \"better\" will become the first.\n   - The second last word \"the\" will become the second.\n   - The third last word \"donations\" will become the third.\n   - The fourth last word \"attends\" will become the fourth.\n   - The fifth last word \"of\" will become the fifth.\n   - The first word \"can\" will become the last.\n\n5. **Create the Reversed List**: The reversed list of words is: \"better, the, donations, attends, of, can\".\n\n6. **Format the Answer**: The final step is to format the answer as a comma-separated list of words with a space after each comma, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<better, the, donations, attends, of, can>>>"
