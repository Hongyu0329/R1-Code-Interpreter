    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List of Words**: The list provided is: \"with, elect, dark, of\".\n\n2. **Understand the Task**: The task is to reverse the order of the words in the list. This means the first word should become the last, the second word should become the second last, and so on.\n\n3. **List the Words in Order**: \n   - First word: \"with\"\n   - Second word: \"elect\"\n   - Third word: \"dark\"\n   - Fourth word: \"of\"\n\n4. **Reverse the Order**: \n   - The last word \"of\" should come first.\n   - The third word \"dark\" should come second.\n   - The second word \"elect\" should come third.\n   - The first word \"with\" should come last.\n\n5. **Create the Reversed List**: The reversed order of the words is: \"of, dark, elect, with\".\n\n6. **Format the Answer**: The final step is to format the answer as a comma-separated list of words with a space after each comma, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the final answer:\n\n<<<of, dark, elect, with>>>"
