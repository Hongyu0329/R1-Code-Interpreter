    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List**: The list of words given is: \"seems, was, tubes, up\".\n\n2. **Understand the Order**: The words are currently in the order they are listed: \n   - First word: \"seems\"\n   - Second word: \"was\"\n   - Third word: \"tubes\"\n   - Fourth word: \"up\"\n\n3. **Reverse the Order**: To reverse the list, we need to rearrange the words in the opposite order:\n   - First word in the reversed list: \"up\"\n   - Second word in the reversed list: \"tubes\"\n   - Third word in the reversed list: \"was\"\n   - Fourth word in the reversed list: \"seems\"\n\n4. **Format the Answer**: The final step is to format the reversed list as a comma-separated list of words with a space after each comma, and enclose it within triple angle brackets.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the reversed list of words.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<up, tubes, was, seems>>>"
