    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words \"Good, any, Mr,\" we need to follow a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Identify the List of Words**: \n   - The given list of words is: \"Good, any, Mr.\"\n\n2. **Understand the Order**:\n   - The words are currently in the order: \n     1. Good\n     2. any\n     3. Mr\n\n3. **Reverse the Order**:\n   - To reverse the list, we need to change the order of the words from the original sequence to the opposite sequence.\n   - The reversed order will be:\n     1. Mr\n     2. any\n     3. Good\n\n4. **Format the Answer**:\n   - The problem specifies that the answer should be provided as a comma-separated list of words with a space after each comma, and enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n   - Therefore, the reversed list should be formatted as: \"Mr, any, Good\"\n\n5. **Final Answer**:\n   - Enclose the formatted reversed list within triple angle brackets.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the final answer:\n\n<<<Mr, any, Good>>>"
