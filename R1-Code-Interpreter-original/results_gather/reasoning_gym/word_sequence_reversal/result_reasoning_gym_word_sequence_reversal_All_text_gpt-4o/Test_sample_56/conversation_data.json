    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List of Words**: The list of words given is: \"chamber, in, the, with, org, GUTENBERG\".\n\n2. **Understand the Task**: The task is to reverse the order of these words. This means the last word in the original list should become the first word in the reversed list, the second last word should become the second word in the reversed list, and so on.\n\n3. **Reversing the List**: \n   - The original order is: chamber, in, the, with, org, GUTENBERG.\n   - Reversing this order, we get: GUTENBERG, org, with, the, in, chamber.\n\n4. **Formatting the Answer**: The final answer should be presented as a comma-separated list of words, with a space after each comma, and enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\n5. **Final Answer**: Based on the reversed order, the final answer is:\n\n<<<GUTENBERG, org, with, the, in, chamber>>>"
