    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List of Words**: The list provided is \"computers, That, race, his\".\n\n2. **Understand the Order**: The words are currently in the order they are listed: \n   - First word: \"computers\"\n   - Second word: \"That\"\n   - Third word: \"race\"\n   - Fourth word: \"his\"\n\n3. **Reverse the Order**: To reverse the list, we need to change the order of the words so that the last word becomes the first, the second-to-last becomes the second, and so on. The reversed order will be:\n   - First word: \"his\"\n   - Second word: \"race\"\n   - Third word: \"That\"\n   - Fourth word: \"computers\"\n\n4. **Format the Answer**: The final step is to format the reversed list as a comma-separated list of words with a space after each comma, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the reversed list of words.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<his, race, That, computers>>>"
