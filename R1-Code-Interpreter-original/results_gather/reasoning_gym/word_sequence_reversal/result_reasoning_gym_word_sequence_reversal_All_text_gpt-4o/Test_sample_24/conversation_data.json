    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List of Words**: \n   - The given list of words is: \"the, THAT, requirements, condition, phrase, the, to\".\n\n2. **Understand the Task**:\n   - We need to reverse the order of the words in the list. This means the first word will become the last, the second word will become the second last, and so on.\n\n3. **Reversing the List**:\n   - Start with the last word and move towards the first word, listing them in reverse order.\n\n4. **List the Words in Reverse Order**:\n   - The original list is: the, THAT, requirements, condition, phrase, the, to.\n   - Reversing this list gives us: to, the, phrase, condition, requirements, THAT, the.\n\n5. **Format the Answer**:\n   - The final answer should be a comma-separated list of words with a space after each comma, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the final reversed list of words.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<to, the, phrase, condition, requirements, THAT, the>>>."
