    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words \"Smith, share, C,\" we need to follow a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Identify the List of Words**: \n   - The given list of words is: \"Smith, share, C.\"\n\n2. **Understand the Structure**:\n   - The list is composed of three words: \"Smith,\" \"share,\" and \"C.\"\n   - These words are separated by commas and spaces.\n\n3. **Reverse the Order**:\n   - To reverse the list, we need to change the order of the words from the original sequence to the opposite sequence.\n   - The original order is: \"Smith,\" \"share,\" \"C.\"\n   - The reversed order will be: \"C,\" \"share,\" \"Smith.\"\n\n4. **Format the Answer**:\n   - The problem specifies that the answer should be provided as a comma-separated list of words with a space after each comma.\n   - Additionally, the answer should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\n5. **Construct the Final Answer**:\n   - Based on the reversed order, the final answer should be formatted as: <<<C, share, Smith>>>.\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that the list of words is correctly reversed and formatted according to the given instructions.\n\nFinal Answer: <<<C, share, Smith>>>"
