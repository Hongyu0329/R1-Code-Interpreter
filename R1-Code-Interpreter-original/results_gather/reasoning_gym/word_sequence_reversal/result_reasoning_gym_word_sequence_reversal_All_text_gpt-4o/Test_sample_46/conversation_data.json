    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List of Words**: The list of words given is: \"present, he, For, of\".\n\n2. **Understand the Order**: The words are currently in the order they are listed: \n   - First word: \"present\"\n   - Second word: \"he\"\n   - Third word: \"For\"\n   - Fourth word: \"of\"\n\n3. **Reverse the Order**: To reverse the list, we need to start from the last word and move to the first:\n   - First in the reversed list: \"of\"\n   - Second in the reversed list: \"For\"\n   - Third in the reversed list: \"he\"\n   - Fourth in the reversed list: \"present\"\n\n4. **Format the Answer**: The final step is to format the reversed list as a comma-separated list of words with a space after each comma, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the reversed list of words.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<of, For, he, present>>>"
