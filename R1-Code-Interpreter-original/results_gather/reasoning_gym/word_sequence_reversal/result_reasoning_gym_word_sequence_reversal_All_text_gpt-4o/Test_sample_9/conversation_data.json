    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Task**: We are given a list of words and need to reverse the order of these words.\n\n2. **Identify the List**: The list provided is: \"In, was, men, any, of, my\".\n\n3. **List the Words**: Break down the list into individual words:\n   - In\n   - was\n   - men\n   - any\n   - of\n   - my\n\n4. **Reverse the Order**: To reverse the list, we need to start from the last word and move to the first:\n   - my\n   - of\n   - any\n   - men\n   - was\n   - In\n\n5. **Format the Answer**: The final step is to format the reversed list as a comma-separated list of words with a space after each comma, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the final reversed list.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<my, of, any, men, was, In>>>"
