    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List of Words**: The list provided is: \"bed, if, problem, but, Well, an, transmission, nutritive\".\n\n2. **Understand the Task**: The task is to reverse the order of the words in the list. This means the first word will become the last, the second word will become the second last, and so on.\n\n3. **List the Words in Order**: \n   - First word: bed\n   - Second word: if\n   - Third word: problem\n   - Fourth word: but\n   - Fifth word: Well\n   - Sixth word: an\n   - Seventh word: transmission\n   - Eighth word: nutritive\n\n4. **Reverse the Order**: \n   - The last word (nutritive) becomes the first.\n   - The second last word (transmission) becomes the second.\n   - Continue this process until the first word (bed) becomes the last.\n\n5. **Reversed List**: \n   - First word: nutritive\n   - Second word: transmission\n   - Third word: an\n   - Fourth word: Well\n   - Fifth word: but\n   - Sixth word: problem\n   - Seventh word: if\n   - Eighth word: bed\n\n6. **Format the Answer**: The final step is to format the reversed list as a comma-separated list of words with a space after each comma, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final reversed list is: <<<nutritive, transmission, an, Well, but, problem, if, bed>>>"
