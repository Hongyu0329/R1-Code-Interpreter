    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List of Words**: The list provided is \"Project, and, Project, Mr\".\n\n2. **Understand the Order**: The words are currently in the order they are listed: \n   - First word: \"Project\"\n   - Second word: \"and\"\n   - Third word: \"Project\"\n   - Fourth word: \"Mr\"\n\n3. **Reverse the Order**: To reverse the list, we need to rearrange the words in the opposite order:\n   - First word in the reversed list: \"Mr\"\n   - Second word in the reversed list: \"Project\"\n   - Third word in the reversed list: \"and\"\n   - Fourth word in the reversed list: \"Project\"\n\n4. **Format the Answer**: The final step is to format the reversed list as a comma-separated list of words with a space after each comma, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the reversed list of words.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<Mr, Project, and, Project>>>"
