    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List of Words**: The list of words given is: \"having, transcribe, appearing, positively, and, be\".\n\n2. **Understand the Task**: The task is to reverse the order of these words. This means the last word in the original list should become the first word in the reversed list, the second last word should become the second word in the reversed list, and so on.\n\n3. **List the Words in Order**: \n   - Original order: having, transcribe, appearing, positively, and, be\n\n4. **Reverse the Order**: \n   - Start with the last word and move to the first:\n     - be\n     - and\n     - positively\n     - appearing\n     - transcribe\n     - having\n\n5. **Format the Answer**: The final step is to format the reversed list as a comma-separated list of words with a space after each comma, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the reversed list of words.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<be, and, positively, appearing, transcribe, having>>>"
