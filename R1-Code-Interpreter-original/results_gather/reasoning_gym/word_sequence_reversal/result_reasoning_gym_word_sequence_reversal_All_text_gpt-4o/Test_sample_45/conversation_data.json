    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List of Words**: The list provided is: \"of, to, Progress, North, recount\".\n\n2. **Understand the Order**: The words are currently in the order they are listed. Our task is to reverse this order.\n\n3. **Reverse the List**: To reverse the list, we need to start from the last word and move to the first word. The original order is:\n   - \"of\"\n   - \"to\"\n   - \"Progress\"\n   - \"North\"\n   - \"recount\"\n\n   Reversing this order gives us:\n   - \"recount\"\n   - \"North\"\n   - \"Progress\"\n   - \"to\"\n   - \"of\"\n\n4. **Format the Answer**: The problem specifies that the answer should be a comma-separated list of words, with a space after each comma, and enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\n5. **Construct the Final Answer**: Based on the reversed order, the final answer should be formatted as follows:\n   - \"recount, North, Progress, to, of\"\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that the list is correctly reversed and formatted according to the instructions.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<recount, North, Progress, to, of>>>"
