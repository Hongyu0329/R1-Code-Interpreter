    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List of Words**: The list of words given is: \"yourself, pillows, and, your, and, They, and\".\n\n2. **Understand the Task**: The task is to reverse the order of these words. This means the first word will become the last, the second word will become the second last, and so on.\n\n3. **List the Words in Order**: \n   - yourself\n   - pillows\n   - and\n   - your\n   - and\n   - They\n   - and\n\n4. **Reverse the Order**: Start from the last word and move to the first:\n   - and\n   - They\n   - and\n   - your\n   - and\n   - pillows\n   - yourself\n\n5. **Format the Answer**: The final step is to format the reversed list as a comma-separated list of words with a space after each comma, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the reversed list:\n\n<<<and, They, and, your, and, pillows, yourself>>>"
