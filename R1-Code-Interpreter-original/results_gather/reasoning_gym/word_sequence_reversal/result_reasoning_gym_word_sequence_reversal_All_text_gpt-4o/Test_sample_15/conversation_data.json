    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List of Words**: The list provided is: \"years, Project, not, another, ages\".\n\n2. **Understand the Order**: The words are currently in the following order:\n   - First word: \"years\"\n   - Second word: \"Project\"\n   - Third word: \"not\"\n   - Fourth word: \"another\"\n   - Fifth word: \"ages\"\n\n3. **Reverse the Order**: To reverse the list, we need to rearrange the words in the opposite order from which they are currently listed. This means the last word will become the first, the second to last will become the second, and so on.\n\n4. **Reversed List**: The reversed order of the words will be:\n   - First word: \"ages\"\n   - Second word: \"another\"\n   - Third word: \"not\"\n   - Fourth word: \"Project\"\n   - Fifth word: \"years\"\n\n5. **Format the Answer**: The final step is to format the reversed list as a comma-separated list of words with a space after each comma, and enclose the entire list within triple angle brackets.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the final answer:\n\n<<<ages, another, not, Project, years>>>"
