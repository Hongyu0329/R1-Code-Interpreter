    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List of Words**: The list of words given is: \"entered, eBooks, to, She, his\".\n\n2. **Understand the Task**: The task is to reverse the order of the words in the list. This means the last word should become the first, the second last should become the second, and so on.\n\n3. **Reversing the List**: \n   - The original order is: entered, eBooks, to, She, his.\n   - Reversing this order, we get: his, She, to, eBooks, entered.\n\n4. **Formatting the Answer**: The final answer should be presented as a comma-separated list of words, with a space after each comma, and enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the final reversed list of words.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<his, She, to, eBooks, entered>>>."
