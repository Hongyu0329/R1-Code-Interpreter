    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List of Words**: The list provided is: \"Besides, people, OF, Defects, aërial, from, campaign\".\n\n2. **Understand the Task**: The task is to reverse the order of the words in the list. This means the first word will become the last, the second word will become the second last, and so on.\n\n3. **List the Words in Order**: \n   - First word: \"Besides\"\n   - Second word: \"people\"\n   - Third word: \"OF\"\n   - Fourth word: \"Defects\"\n   - Fifth word: \"aërial\"\n   - Sixth word: \"from\"\n   - Seventh word: \"campaign\"\n\n4. **Reverse the Order**: \n   - The last word \"campaign\" will become the first.\n   - The second last word \"from\" will become the second.\n   - The third last word \"aërial\" will become the third.\n   - The fourth last word \"Defects\" will become the fourth.\n   - The fifth last word \"OF\" will become the fifth.\n   - The sixth last word \"people\" will become the sixth.\n   - The first word \"Besides\" will become the last.\n\n5. **Construct the Reversed List**: \n   - First: \"campaign\"\n   - Second: \"from\"\n   - Third: \"aërial\"\n   - Fourth: \"Defects\"\n   - Fifth: \"OF\"\n   - Sixth: \"people\"\n   - Seventh: \"Besides\"\n\n6. **Format the Answer**: The final step is to format the reversed list as a comma-separated list of words with a space after each comma, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final reversed list of words is: <<<campaign, from, aërial, Defects, OF, people, Besides>>>."
