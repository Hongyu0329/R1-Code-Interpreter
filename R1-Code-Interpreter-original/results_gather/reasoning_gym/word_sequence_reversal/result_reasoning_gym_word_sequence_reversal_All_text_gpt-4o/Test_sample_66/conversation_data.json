    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List of Words**: The list provided is: \"whatever, button, is, 200, including\".\n\n2. **Understand the Task**: We need to reverse the order of the words in the list. This means the first word will become the last, the second word will become the second last, and so on.\n\n3. **List the Words**: \n   - whatever\n   - button\n   - is\n   - 200\n   - including\n\n4. **Reverse the Order**: \n   - The last word \"including\" will become the first.\n   - The second last word \"200\" will become the second.\n   - The middle word \"is\" will remain in the middle.\n   - The second word \"button\" will become the second last.\n   - The first word \"whatever\" will become the last.\n\n5. **Reversed List**: \n   - including\n   - 200\n   - is\n   - button\n   - whatever\n\n6. **Format the Answer**: The final step is to format the reversed list as a comma-separated list of words with a space after each comma, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<including, 200, is, button, whatever>>>"
