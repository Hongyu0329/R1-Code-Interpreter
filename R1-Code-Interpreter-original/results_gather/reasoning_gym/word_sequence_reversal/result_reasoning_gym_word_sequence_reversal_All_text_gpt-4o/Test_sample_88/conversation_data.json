    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Task**: We are given a list of words and need to reverse the order of these words.\n\n2. **Identify the List**: The list of words provided is: \"of, newspaper, the, may, Smith, the, irritation\".\n\n3. **List the Words**: Break down the list into individual words:\n   - \"of\"\n   - \"newspaper\"\n   - \"the\"\n   - \"may\"\n   - \"Smith\"\n   - \"the\"\n   - \"irritation\"\n\n4. **Reverse the Order**: To reverse the list, we start from the last word and move to the first:\n   - Start with \"irritation\"\n   - Then \"the\"\n   - Then \"Smith\"\n   - Then \"may\"\n   - Then \"the\"\n   - Then \"newspaper\"\n   - Finally \"of\"\n\n5. **Reconstruct the List**: After reversing, the list of words becomes:\n   - \"irritation\"\n   - \"the\"\n   - \"Smith\"\n   - \"may\"\n   - \"the\"\n   - \"newspaper\"\n   - \"of\"\n\n6. **Format the Answer**: The final step is to format the reversed list as a comma-separated list of words with a space after each comma, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the final answer:\n\n<<<irritation, the, Smith, may, the, newspaper, of>>>"
