    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List**: The list of words given is: electronic, a, you, you, is, this.\n\n2. **Understand the Task**: We need to reverse the order of the words in the list. This means the last word will become the first, the second last will become the second, and so on.\n\n3. **Reverse the List**: \n   - Start with the last word \"this\" and make it the first.\n   - The second last word \"is\" becomes the second.\n   - The third last word \"you\" becomes the third.\n   - The fourth last word \"you\" becomes the fourth.\n   - The fifth last word \"a\" becomes the fifth.\n   - The first word \"electronic\" becomes the last.\n\n4. **Construct the Reversed List**: After reversing, the list of words will be: this, is, you, you, a, electronic.\n\n5. **Format the Answer**: The final step is to format the reversed list as a comma-separated list of words with a space after each comma, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the final answer:\n\n<<<this, is, you, you, a, electronic>>>"
