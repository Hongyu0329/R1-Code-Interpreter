    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List**: The list of words given is: City, writers, alone, am, was, to, below.\n\n2. **Understand the Task**: The task is to reverse the order of the words in the list. This means the first word will become the last, the second word will become the second last, and so on.\n\n3. **Reverse the List**: \n   - The original order is: City, writers, alone, am, was, to, below.\n   - Reversing this order, we get: below, to, was, am, alone, writers, City.\n\n4. **Format the Answer**: The final step is to format the reversed list as a comma-separated list of words with a space after each comma, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the final answer:\n\n<<<below, to, was, am, alone, writers, City>>>"
