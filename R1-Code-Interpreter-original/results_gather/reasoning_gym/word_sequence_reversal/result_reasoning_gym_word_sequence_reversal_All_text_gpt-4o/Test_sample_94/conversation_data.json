    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List**: First, we need to clearly identify the list of words that we are required to reverse. The list given is: \n   - name\n   - Gutenberg\n   - when\n   - upward\n   - Gutenberg\n   - all\n   - Then\n\n2. **Understand the Order**: The words are currently in the order as listed above. Our task is to reverse this order.\n\n3. **Reverse the List**: To reverse the list, we start from the last word and move to the first word. This means the last word in the original list will become the first word in the reversed list, and so on.\n\n4. **Construct the Reversed List**: By reversing the order, the list becomes:\n   - Then\n   - all\n   - Gutenberg\n   - upward\n   - when\n   - Gutenberg\n   - name\n\n5. **Format the Answer**: The final step is to format the reversed list as a comma-separated list of words, with a space after each comma, and enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the final answer:\n\n<<<Then, all, Gutenberg, upward, when, Gutenberg, name>>>"
