    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List of Words**: The list of words given is \"addressing, electronic, the\".\n\n2. **Understand the Order**: The words are currently in the order: \n   - First word: \"addressing\"\n   - Second word: \"electronic\"\n   - Third word: \"the\"\n\n3. **Reverse the Order**: To reverse the list, we need to change the order of the words such that the last word becomes the first, the second word remains in the middle, and the first word becomes the last. The reversed order will be:\n   - First word: \"the\"\n   - Second word: \"electronic\"\n   - Third word: \"addressing\"\n\n4. **Format the Answer**: The final step is to format the reversed list of words as a comma-separated list with a space after each comma, and enclose it within triple angle brackets.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the final reversed list of words.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<the, electronic, addressing>>>"
