    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List**: The list of words given is: \"does, IS, by, in, should\".\n\n2. **Understand the Order**: The words are currently in the order they are listed. Our task is to reverse this order.\n\n3. **Reverse the List**: To reverse the list, we need to start from the last word and move to the first. The reversed order will be: \"should, in, by, IS, does\".\n\n4. **Format the Answer**: The problem specifies that the answer should be provided as a comma-separated list of words, with a space after each comma, and enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\n5. **Construct the Final Answer**: Based on the reversed order and the required format, the final answer is constructed.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the final answer:\n\n<<<should, in, by, IS, does>>>"
