    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List of Words**: The list of words given is: \"what, Reduced, inaction, It\".\n\n2. **Understand the Order**: The words are currently in the order they are presented: \n   - First word: \"what\"\n   - Second word: \"Reduced\"\n   - Third word: \"inaction\"\n   - Fourth word: \"It\"\n\n3. **Reverse the Order**: To reverse the list, we need to start from the last word and move to the first. The reversed order will be:\n   - First word: \"It\"\n   - Second word: \"inaction\"\n   - Third word: \"Reduced\"\n   - Fourth word: \"what\"\n\n4. **Format the Answer**: The final step is to format the reversed list as a comma-separated list of words with a space after each comma, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the final answer:\n\n<<<It, inaction, Reduced, what>>>"
