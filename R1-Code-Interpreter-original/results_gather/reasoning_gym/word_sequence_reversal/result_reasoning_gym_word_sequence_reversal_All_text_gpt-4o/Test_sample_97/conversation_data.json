    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List of Words**: The given list of words is: widest, chemist, is, keeping, Britain, having, the.\n\n2. **Understand the Task**: We need to reverse the order of these words. This means the last word in the original list will become the first word in the reversed list, the second last word will become the second word in the reversed list, and so on.\n\n3. **Reverse the List**: Let's reverse the order of the words:\n   - Original order: widest, chemist, is, keeping, Britain, having, the\n   - Reversed order: the, having, Britain, keeping, is, chemist, widest\n\n4. **Format the Answer**: The problem specifies that the answer should be provided as a comma-separated list of words, with a space after each comma, and enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\n5. **Construct the Final Answer**: Based on the reversed order, the final answer should be formatted as follows:\n\n<<<the, having, Britain, keeping, is, chemist, widest>>>"
