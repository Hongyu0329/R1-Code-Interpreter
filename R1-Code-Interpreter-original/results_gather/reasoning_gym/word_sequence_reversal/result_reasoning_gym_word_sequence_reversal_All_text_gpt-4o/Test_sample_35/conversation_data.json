    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words \"waiting, or, inaccurate,\" we need to follow a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Identify the List of Words**: \n   - The given list of words is: \"waiting, or, inaccurate.\"\n\n2. **Understand the Task**: \n   - We need to reverse the order of the words in the list. This means the last word should come first, the first word should come last, and so on.\n\n3. **List the Words**: \n   - The words in the list are:\n     1. waiting\n     2. or\n     3. inaccurate\n\n4. **Reverse the Order**: \n   - To reverse the order, we rearrange the words as follows:\n     1. inaccurate\n     2. or\n     3. waiting\n\n5. **Format the Answer**: \n   - The final step is to format the reversed list of words as a comma-separated list with a space after each comma, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the final reversed list of words.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<inaccurate, or, waiting>>>"
