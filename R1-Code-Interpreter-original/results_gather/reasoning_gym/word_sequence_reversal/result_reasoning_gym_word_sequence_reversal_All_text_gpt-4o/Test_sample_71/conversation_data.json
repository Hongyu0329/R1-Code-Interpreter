    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List of Words**: The list of words given is: Project, what, You, truth, work, or, telephone, portrayed.\n\n2. **Understand the Task**: The task is to reverse the order of these words. This means the first word will become the last, the second word will become the second last, and so on.\n\n3. **Reversing the List**: We will take the list and reverse the order of the words. The original order is:\n   - Project\n   - what\n   - You\n   - truth\n   - work\n   - or\n   - telephone\n   - portrayed\n\n   Reversing this order, we get:\n   - portrayed\n   - telephone\n   - or\n   - work\n   - truth\n   - You\n   - what\n   - Project\n\n4. **Formatting the Answer**: The final step is to format the reversed list as a comma-separated list of words with a space after each comma, and enclose it within triple angle brackets.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the final answer:\n\n<<<portrayed, telephone, or, work, truth, You, what, Project>>>"
