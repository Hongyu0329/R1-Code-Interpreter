    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words \"His, narrative, reporter,\" we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List of Words**: \n   - The list provided is: \"His, narrative, reporter.\"\n\n2. **Understand the Order**:\n   - The words are currently in the order: \n     1. His\n     2. narrative\n     3. reporter\n\n3. **Reverse the Order**:\n   - To reverse the list, we need to change the order of the words so that the last word becomes the first, the second-to-last becomes the second, and so on.\n   - The reversed order will be:\n     1. reporter\n     2. narrative\n     3. His\n\n4. **Format the Answer**:\n   - The problem specifies that the answer should be provided as a comma-separated list of words with a space after each comma, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n   - Therefore, the reversed list should be formatted as: <<<reporter, narrative, His>>>\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that the list is correctly reversed and formatted according to the given instructions.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<<<reporter, narrative, His>>>"
