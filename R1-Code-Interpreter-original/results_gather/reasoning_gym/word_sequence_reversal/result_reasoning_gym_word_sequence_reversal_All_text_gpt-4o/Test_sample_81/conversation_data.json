    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words \"I, populations, defect,\" we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List of Words**: \n   - The given list of words is: \"I, populations, defect.\"\n\n2. **Understand the Order**:\n   - The words are currently in the order: \n     1. I\n     2. populations\n     3. defect\n\n3. **Reverse the Order**:\n   - To reverse the list, we need to change the order of the words so that the last word becomes the first, the second-to-last becomes the second, and so on.\n   - The reversed order will be:\n     1. defect\n     2. populations\n     3. I\n\n4. **Format the Answer**:\n   - The problem specifies that the answer should be provided as a comma-separated list of words with a space after each comma, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n   - Therefore, the reversed list should be formatted as: <<<defect, populations, I>>>\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that we have correctly reversed the list and formatted the answer as required.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<<<defect, populations, I>>>"
