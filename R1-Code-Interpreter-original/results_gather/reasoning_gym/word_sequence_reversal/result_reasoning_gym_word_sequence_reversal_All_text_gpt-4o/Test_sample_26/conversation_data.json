    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List of Words**: The list of words given is: \"France, True, and, invented, I, to, work\".\n\n2. **Understand the Task**: The task is to reverse the order of these words. This means the word that is currently last should come first, the second last should come second, and so on.\n\n3. **List the Words in Order**: \n   - Original order: France, True, and, invented, I, to, work\n\n4. **Reverse the Order**: \n   - Start from the last word and move to the first:\n     - Last word: work\n     - Second last: to\n     - Third last: I\n     - Fourth last: invented\n     - Fifth last: and\n     - Sixth last: True\n     - Seventh last (first in original): France\n\n5. **Create the Reversed List**: \n   - Reversed order: work, to, I, invented, and, True, France\n\n6. **Format the Answer**: The final answer should be a comma-separated list of words with a space after each comma, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the final reversed list of words.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<work, to, I, invented, and, True, France>>>"
