    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List of Words**: The list of words given is: \"OR, Foundation, men, are, Mr\".\n\n2. **Understand the Task**: The task is to reverse the order of these words. This means the last word in the original list should become the first word in the reversed list, the second last word should become the second word in the reversed list, and so on.\n\n3. **List the Words in Order**: \n   - First word: OR\n   - Second word: Foundation\n   - Third word: men\n   - Fourth word: are\n   - Fifth word: Mr\n\n4. **Reverse the Order**: \n   - The first word in the reversed list will be the last word of the original list: Mr\n   - The second word in the reversed list will be the second last word of the original list: are\n   - The third word in the reversed list will be the third last word of the original list: men\n   - The fourth word in the reversed list will be the fourth last word of the original list: Foundation\n   - The fifth word in the reversed list will be the fifth last word of the original list: OR\n\n5. **Construct the Reversed List**: The reversed list of words is: \"Mr, are, men, Foundation, OR\".\n\n6. **Format the Answer**: The final answer should be formatted as a comma-separated list of words with a space after each comma, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the final answer:\n\n<<<Mr, are, men, Foundation, OR>>>"
