    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List of Words**: The list provided is \"of, all, passed, the\".\n\n2. **Understand the Order**: The words are currently in the order: \n   - \"of\"\n   - \"all\"\n   - \"passed\"\n   - \"the\"\n\n3. **Reverse the Order**: To reverse the list, we need to rearrange the words in the opposite order. The last word becomes the first, the second last becomes the second, and so on.\n\n4. **Reversed Order**: \n   - The last word \"the\" becomes the first.\n   - The second last word \"passed\" becomes the second.\n   - The third word \"all\" becomes the third.\n   - The first word \"of\" becomes the last.\n\n5. **Construct the Reversed List**: The reversed list of words is:\n   - \"the\"\n   - \"passed\"\n   - \"all\"\n   - \"of\"\n\n6. **Format the Answer**: The final step is to format the reversed list as a comma-separated list of words with a space after each comma, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the final answer:\n\n<<<the, passed, all, of>>>"
