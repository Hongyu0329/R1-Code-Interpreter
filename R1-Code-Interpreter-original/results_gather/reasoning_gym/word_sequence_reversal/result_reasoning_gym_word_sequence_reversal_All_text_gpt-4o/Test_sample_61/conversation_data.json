    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List of Words**: \n   - The given list of words is: \"Suddenly, writers, the, of, indeed, how\".\n\n2. **Understand the Task**:\n   - We need to reverse the order of these words.\n\n3. **List the Words**:\n   - Break down the sentence into individual words: \n     - \"Suddenly\"\n     - \"writers\"\n     - \"the\"\n     - \"of\"\n     - \"indeed\"\n     - \"how\"\n\n4. **Reverse the Order**:\n   - Start from the last word and move to the first:\n     - \"how\"\n     - \"indeed\"\n     - \"of\"\n     - \"the\"\n     - \"writers\"\n     - \"Suddenly\"\n\n5. **Format the Answer**:\n   - Combine the reversed list into a single string, with each word separated by a comma and a space.\n   - Ensure the list is enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\n6. **Final Answer**:\n   - The reversed list of words is: \"how, indeed, of, the, writers, Suddenly\".\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that the list is correctly reversed and formatted as required.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<how, indeed, of, the, writers, Suddenly>>>"
