    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words \"silent, Mr, he,\" we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List of Words**: The list provided is \"silent, Mr, he.\" This is a sequence of three words.\n\n2. **Understand the Order**: The words are currently in the order: \n   - First word: \"silent\"\n   - Second word: \"Mr\"\n   - Third word: \"he\"\n\n3. **Reverse the Order**: To reverse the list, we need to change the order of the words such that the last word becomes the first, the second word remains in the middle, and the first word becomes the last. The reversed order will be:\n   - First word: \"he\"\n   - Second word: \"Mr\"\n   - Third word: \"silent\"\n\n4. **Format the Answer**: The problem specifies that the answer should be provided as a comma-separated list of words with a space after each comma, and the entire list should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\n5. **Construct the Final Answer**: Based on the reversed order, the final answer should be formatted as follows:\n   - \"he, Mr, silent\"\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that the list is correctly reversed and formatted according to the instructions.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<he, Mr, silent>>>"
