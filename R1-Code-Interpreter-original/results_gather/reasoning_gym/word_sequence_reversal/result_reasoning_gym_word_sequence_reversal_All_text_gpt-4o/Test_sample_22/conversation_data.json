    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the List of Words**: The list provided is \"obtaining, having, of, 3\". This is a sequence of four elements.\n\n2. **Understand the Task**: The task is to reverse the order of these words. Reversing means that the last element becomes the first, the second last becomes the second, and so on.\n\n3. **Reverse the List**: \n   - The original order is: \"obtaining\", \"having\", \"of\", \"3\".\n   - Reversing this order, we get: \"3\", \"of\", \"having\", \"obtaining\".\n\n4. **Format the Answer**: The problem specifies that the answer should be a comma-separated list of words with a space after each comma, and it should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\n5. **Construct the Final Answer**: \n   - The reversed list is: \"3\", \"of\", \"having\", \"obtaining\".\n   - Format it as: <<<3, of, having, obtaining>>>.\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that we have carefully considered each part of the problem and formatted the answer correctly.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<3, of, having, obtaining>>>"
