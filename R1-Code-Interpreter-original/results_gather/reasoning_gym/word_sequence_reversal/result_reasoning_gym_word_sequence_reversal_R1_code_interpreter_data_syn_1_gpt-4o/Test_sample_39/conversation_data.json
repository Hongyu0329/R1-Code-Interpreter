    "To solve this problem, we need to reverse the order of the words in the given list. The list of words is: \"can\", \"IN\", \"Smith\", \"and\", \"extensive\". \n\nThe task is straightforward: we will reverse the list and then format the output as a comma-separated list of words with a space after each comma.\n\nLet's write a Python script to reverse the list and print the result in the required format.\n\n```python\n# Original list of words\nwords = [\"can\", \"IN\", \"Smith\", \"and\", \"extensive\"]\n\n# Reverse the list\nreversed_words = words[::-1]\n\n# Join the reversed list into a string with the required format\nresult = ', '.join(reversed_words)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the reversed list of words.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the reversed list of words in the required format. \n\nThe reversed list of words is: \"extensive\", \"and\", \"Smith\", \"IN\", \"can\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<extensive, and, Smith, IN, can>>>"
