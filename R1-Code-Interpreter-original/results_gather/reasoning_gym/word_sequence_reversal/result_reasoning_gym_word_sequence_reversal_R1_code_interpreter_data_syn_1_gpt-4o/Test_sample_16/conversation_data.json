    "To solve this problem, we need to reverse the order of the words in the given list. The list of words is: \"me, you, of, being, the, map, a\". \n\nThe task is straightforward: we will reverse the list and then format it as a comma-separated string with a space after each comma. \n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this operation:\n\n```python\n# Original list of words\nwords = [\"me\", \"you\", \"of\", \"being\", \"the\", \"map\", \"a\"]\n\n# Reverse the list\nreversed_words = list(reversed(words))\n\n# Join the reversed list into a comma-separated string\nresult = \", \".join(reversed_words)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the reversed list of words.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the reversed list of words. Now, I will present the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<a, map, the, being, of, you, me>>>"
