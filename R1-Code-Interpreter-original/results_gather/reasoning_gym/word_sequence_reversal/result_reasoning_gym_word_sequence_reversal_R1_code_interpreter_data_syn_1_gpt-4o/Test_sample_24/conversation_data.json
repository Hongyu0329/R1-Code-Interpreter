    "To solve this problem, we need to reverse the order of the words in the given list. The list of words is: \n\n- the\n- THAT\n- requirements\n- condition\n- phrase\n- the\n- to\n\nThe task is straightforward: we need to reverse the order of these words and then provide the result as a comma-separated list of words with a space after each comma, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's write a Python script to reverse the list and format the output as required.\n\n```python\n# Original list of words\nwords = [\"the\", \"THAT\", \"requirements\", \"condition\", \"phrase\", \"the\", \"to\"]\n\n# Reverse the list\nreversed_words = words[::-1]\n\n# Join the reversed list into a string with the required format\nresult = \", \".join(reversed_words)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the reversed list of words.",
