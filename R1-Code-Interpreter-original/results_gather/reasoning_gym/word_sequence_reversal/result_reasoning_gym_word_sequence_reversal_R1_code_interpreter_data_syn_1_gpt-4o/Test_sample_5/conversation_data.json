    "To solve this problem, we need to reverse the order of the words in the given list. The list of words is: \n\n- constitution\n- 1500\n- the\n- Project\n- cost\n- no\n- is\n- F\n\nThe task is straightforward: reverse the order of these words and then provide the result as a comma-separated list of words with a space after each comma, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's write a Python script to reverse the list and format the output as required.\n\n```python\n# Original list of words\nwords = [\"constitution\", \"1500\", \"the\", \"Project\", \"cost\", \"no\", \"is\", \"F\"]\n\n# Reverse the list\nreversed_words = words[::-1]\n\n# Join the reversed list into a string with the required format\nresult = \", \".join(reversed_words)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the reversed list.",
    "The code executed successfully and reversed the list of words as required. The output is formatted correctly as a comma-separated list with a space after each comma. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<F, is, no, cost, Project, the, 1500, constitution>>>"
