    "To solve this problem, we need to reverse the order of the words in the given list. The list of words is: \"allow, goals, think, Mr\". \n\nThe steps to solve this problem are:\n1. Split the string into a list of words.\n2. Reverse the list of words.\n3. Join the reversed list back into a string with the same format as the input.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Original list of words as a string\nwords = \"allow, goals, think, Mr\"\n\n# Split the string into a list of words\nwords_list = words.split(\", \")\n\n# Reverse the list of words\nreversed_list = list(reversed(words_list))\n\n# Join the reversed list back into a string\nreversed_string = \", \".join(reversed_list)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(reversed_string)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the reversed list of words.",
