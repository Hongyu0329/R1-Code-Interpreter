    "To solve this problem, we need to reverse the order of the words in the given list. The list of words is: \"of, newspaper, the, may, Smith, the, irritation\". \n\nThe task is straightforward: we will reverse the order of these words and then format them as a comma-separated list with a space after each comma. \n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this task:\n\n```python\n# Original list of words\nwords = [\"of\", \"newspaper\", \"the\", \"may\", \"Smith\", \"the\", \"irritation\"]\n\n# Reverse the list\nreversed_words = list(reversed(words))\n\n# Join the reversed list into a comma-separated string\nresult = \", \".join(reversed_words)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the reversed list of words.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the reversed list of words. Now, I will format the output as requested.\n\nThe reversed list of words is: \"irritation, the, Smith, may, the, newspaper, of\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<irritation, the, Smith, may, the, newspaper, of>>>"
