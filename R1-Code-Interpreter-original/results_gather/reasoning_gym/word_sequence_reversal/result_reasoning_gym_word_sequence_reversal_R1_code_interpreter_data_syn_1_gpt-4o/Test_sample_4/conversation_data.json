    "To solve this problem, we need to reverse the order of the words in the given list. The list of words is: \"anon, things, had, the, the\". \n\nThe task is straightforward: we will reverse the list and then format the output as a comma-separated list of words with a space after each comma.\n\nLet's write a Python script to reverse the list and print the result in the required format.\n\n```python\n# Original list of words\nwords = [\"anon\", \"things\", \"had\", \"the\", \"the\"]\n\n# Reverse the list\nreversed_words = words[::-1]\n\n# Join the reversed list into a string with the required format\nresult = \", \".join(reversed_words)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the reversed list of words.",
