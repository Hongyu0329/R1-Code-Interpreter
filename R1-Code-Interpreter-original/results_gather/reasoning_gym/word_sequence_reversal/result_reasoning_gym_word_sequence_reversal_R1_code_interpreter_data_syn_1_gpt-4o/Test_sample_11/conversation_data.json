    "To solve this problem, we need to reverse the order of the words in the given list. The list of words is: [\"it\", \"pleasure\", \"Gutenberg\"]. \n\nThe task is straightforward: we need to reverse the list and then format the output as a comma-separated list of words with a space after each comma, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's write a Python script to reverse the list and format the output accordingly.\n\n```python\n# Original list of words\nwords = [\"it\", \"pleasure\", \"Gutenberg\"]\n\n# Reverse the list\nreversed_words = words[::-1]\n\n# Format the output as a comma-separated list\nformatted_output = ', '.join(reversed_words)\n\n# Print the formatted output\nprint(f\"<<<{formatted_output}>>>\")\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the final answer.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the correct output. The list of words has been reversed, and the output is formatted as a comma-separated list with a space after each comma, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<Gutenberg, pleasure, it>>>"
