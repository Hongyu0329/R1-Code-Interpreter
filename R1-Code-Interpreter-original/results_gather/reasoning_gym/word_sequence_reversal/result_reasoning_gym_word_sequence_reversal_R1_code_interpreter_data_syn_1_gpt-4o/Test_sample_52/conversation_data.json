    "To solve this problem, we need to reverse the order of the words in the given list. The list of words is: \n\n- an\n- inventors\n- MERCHANTABILITY\n- located\n- with\n- pleased\n- of\n- If\n\nThe task is straightforward: we will reverse the order of these words and then provide the result as a comma-separated list of words, with a space after each comma, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's write a Python script to reverse the list and format the output as required.\n\n```python\n# Original list of words\nwords = [\"an\", \"inventors\", \"MERCHANTABILITY\", \"located\", \"with\", \"pleased\", \"of\", \"If\"]\n\n# Reverse the list\nreversed_words = words[::-1]\n\n# Format the output as a comma-separated list\noutput = \", \".join(reversed_words)\n\n# Print the formatted output\nprint(output)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the reversed list of words.",
