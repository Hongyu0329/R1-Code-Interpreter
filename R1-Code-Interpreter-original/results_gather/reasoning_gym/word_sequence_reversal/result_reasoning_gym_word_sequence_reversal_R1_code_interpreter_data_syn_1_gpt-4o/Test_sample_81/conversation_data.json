    "To solve this problem, we need to reverse the order of the words in the given list. The list of words provided is: \"I\", \"populations\", \"defect\". \n\nThe reversed order of these words should be: \"defect\", \"populations\", \"I\".\n\nLet's implement this in Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Define the list of words\nwords = [\"I\", \"populations\", \"defect\"]\n\n# Reverse the list\nreversed_words = list(reversed(words))\n\n# Print the reversed list as a comma-separated string\nprint(\", \".join(reversed_words))\n```\n\nExecuting the above code will give us the reversed list of words. Let's see the output.",
