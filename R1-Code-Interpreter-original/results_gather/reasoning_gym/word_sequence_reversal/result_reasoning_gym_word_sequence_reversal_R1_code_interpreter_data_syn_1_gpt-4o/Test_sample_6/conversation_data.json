    "To solve this problem, we need to reverse the order of the words in the given list. The list of words is: \"work, terms, The, every, royalties, Foundation, comply, or\". \n\nThe task is straightforward: we will reverse the order of these words and then format them as a comma-separated list with a space after each comma.\n\nLet's write a Python script to reverse the list of words and print the result.\n\n```python\n# Original list of words\nwords = [\"work\", \"terms\", \"The\", \"every\", \"royalties\", \"Foundation\", \"comply\", \"or\"]\n\n# Reverse the list\nreversed_words = list(reversed(words))\n\n# Join the reversed list into a comma-separated string\nresult = \", \".join(reversed_words)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the reversed list of words.",
