    "To solve this problem, we need to reverse the order of the words in the given list. The list of words is: [\"preceding\", \"you\", \"was\", \"what\"].\n\nThe task is straightforward: we need to reverse the list and then format the output as a comma-separated list of words with a space after each comma.\n\nLet's write a Python script to reverse the list and format the output accordingly.\n\n```python\n# Original list of words\nwords = [\"preceding\", \"you\", \"was\", \"what\"]\n\n# Reverse the list\nreversed_words = words[::-1]\n\n# Format the output as a comma-separated list\nformatted_output = ', '.join(reversed_words)\n\n# Print the formatted output\nprint(formatted_output)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the reversed list of words.",
