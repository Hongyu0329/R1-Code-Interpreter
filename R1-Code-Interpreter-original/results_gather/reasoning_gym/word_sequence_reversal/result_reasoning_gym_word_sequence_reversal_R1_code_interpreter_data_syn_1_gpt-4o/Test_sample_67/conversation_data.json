    "To solve this problem, we need to reverse the order of the words in the given list. The list of words is: \"Project, Mountains, projectors, With, Mr, What\". \n\nThe task is straightforward: we will reverse the order of these words and then format them as a comma-separated list with a space after each comma.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this task:\n\n```python\n# Original list of words\nwords = [\"Project\", \"Mountains\", \"projectors\", \"With\", \"Mr\", \"What\"]\n\n# Reverse the list\nreversed_words = list(reversed(words))\n\n# Join the reversed list into a comma-separated string\nresult = \", \".join(reversed_words)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the reversed list of words in the desired format.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the reversed list of words as expected. Now, I will present the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<What, Mr, With, projectors, Mountains, Project>>>"
