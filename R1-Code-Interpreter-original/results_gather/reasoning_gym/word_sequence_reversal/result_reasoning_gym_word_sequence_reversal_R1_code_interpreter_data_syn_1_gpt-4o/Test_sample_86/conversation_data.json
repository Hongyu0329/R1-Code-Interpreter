    "To solve this problem, we need to reverse the order of the words in the given list. The list of words is: \n\n- Mr\n- see\n- professional\n- United\n- early\n- sometimes\n- be\n- made\n\nThe task is to reverse the order of these words and then provide the result as a comma-separated list of words with a space after each comma.\n\nLet's write a Python script to reverse the list and format the output as required.\n\n```python\n# Original list of words\nwords = [\"Mr\", \"see\", \"professional\", \"United\", \"early\", \"sometimes\", \"be\", \"made\"]\n\n# Reverse the list\nreversed_words = words[::-1]\n\n# Join the reversed list into a comma-separated string\nresult = \", \".join(reversed_words)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the reversed list of words.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the reversed list of words. Now, I will format the output as requested.\n\nThe reversed list of words is: made, be, sometimes, early, United, professional, see, Mr\n\nThe final answer, formatted as a comma-separated list of words with a space after each comma, is:\n\n<<<made, be, sometimes, early, United, professional, see, Mr>>>"
