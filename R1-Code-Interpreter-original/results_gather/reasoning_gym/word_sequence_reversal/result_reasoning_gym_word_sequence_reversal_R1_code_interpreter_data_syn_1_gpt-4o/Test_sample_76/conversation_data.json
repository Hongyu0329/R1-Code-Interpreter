The list of words provided is: \"of\", \"It\", \"enough\", \"read\". \n\nThe reversed order of these words should be: \"read\", \"enough\", \"It\", \"of\".\n\nLet's write a Python script to reverse the list and print the result.\n\n```python\n# Original list of words\nwords = [\"of\", \"It\", \"enough\", \"read\"]\n\n# Reverse the list\nreversed_words = list(reversed(words))\n\n# Print the reversed list as a comma-separated string\nprint(\", \".join(reversed_words))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the reversed list of words.",
