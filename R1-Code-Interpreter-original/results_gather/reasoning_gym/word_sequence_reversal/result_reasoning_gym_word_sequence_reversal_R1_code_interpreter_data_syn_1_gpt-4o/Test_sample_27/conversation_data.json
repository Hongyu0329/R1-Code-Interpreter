    "To solve this problem, we need to reverse the order of the words in the given list. The list of words is: \"him, of, time, during\". \n\nThe task is straightforward: we need to reverse the order of these words and then format them as a comma-separated list with a space after each comma.\n\nLet's write a Python script to reverse the list and format it correctly.\n\n```python\n# Original list of words\nwords = [\"him\", \"of\", \"time\", \"during\"]\n\n# Reverse the list\nreversed_words = list(reversed(words))\n\n# Join the reversed list into a string with the required format\nresult = \", \".join(reversed_words)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to get the reversed list of words.",
