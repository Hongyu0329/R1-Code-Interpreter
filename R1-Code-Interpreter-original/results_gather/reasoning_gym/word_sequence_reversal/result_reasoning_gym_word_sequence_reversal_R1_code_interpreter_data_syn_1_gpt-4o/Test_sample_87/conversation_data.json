    "To solve this problem, we need to reverse the order of the words in the given list. The list of words is: \"entered, eBooks, to, She, his\". \n\nThe task is straightforward: we will reverse the list and then format the output as a comma-separated list of words with a space after each comma.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this task:\n\n```python\n# Original list of words\nwords = [\"entered\", \"eBooks\", \"to\", \"She\", \"his\"]\n\n# Reverse the list\nreversed_words = words[::-1]\n\n# Join the reversed list into a comma-separated string\nresult = \", \".join(reversed_words)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the reversed list of words.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the reversed list of words as expected. Now, I will format the output as requested.\n\nThe reversed list of words is: \"his, She, to, eBooks, entered\".\n\n<<<his, She, to, eBooks, entered>>>"
