    "To solve this problem, we need to reverse the order of the words in the given list. The list of words is: \"are, are, state, that, or, reported\". \n\nThe task is straightforward: we need to reverse the order of these words and then provide the result in the specified format. \n\nLet's write a Python script to reverse the list of words and print the result.\n\n```python\n# Original list of words\nwords = [\"are\", \"are\", \"state\", \"that\", \"or\", \"reported\"]\n\n# Reverse the list\nreversed_words = list(reversed(words))\n\n# Print the reversed list as a comma-separated string\nprint(\", \".join(reversed_words))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the reversed list of words.",
