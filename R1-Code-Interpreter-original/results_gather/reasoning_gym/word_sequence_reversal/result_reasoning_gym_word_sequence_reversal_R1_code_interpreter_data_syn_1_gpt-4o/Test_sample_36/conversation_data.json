    "To solve this problem, we need to reverse the order of the words in the given list. The list of words is: \n\n- electronic\n- the\n- light\n- network\n- sentence\n- codes\n- were\n- having\n\nThe task is to reverse the order of these words. We can achieve this by using Python to manipulate the list. Let's write a Python script to reverse the list and print the result.\n\n```python\n# Original list of words\nwords = [\"electronic\", \"the\", \"light\", \"network\", \"sentence\", \"codes\", \"were\", \"having\"]\n\n# Reverse the list\nreversed_words = list(reversed(words))\n\n# Print the reversed list as a comma-separated string\nprint(\", \".join(reversed_words))\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the reversed list of words.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the reversed list of words. Now, I will present the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<having, were, codes, sentence, network, light, the, electronic>>>"
