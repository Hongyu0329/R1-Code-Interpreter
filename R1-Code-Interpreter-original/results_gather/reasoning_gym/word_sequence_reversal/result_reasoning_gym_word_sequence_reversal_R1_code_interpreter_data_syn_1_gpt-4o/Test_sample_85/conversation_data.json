    "To solve this problem, we need to reverse the order of the words in the given list. The list of words is: \"In, then, the, agreement\". \n\nThe task is straightforward: we need to reverse the order of these words and then provide the result in the specified format. \n\nLet's write a Python script to reverse the list of words and print the result.\n\n```python\n# Original list of words\nwords = [\"In\", \"then\", \"the\", \"agreement\"]\n\n# Reverse the list\nreversed_words = list(reversed(words))\n\n# Join the reversed list into a string with the specified format\nresult = ', '.join(reversed_words)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the reversed list of words.",
