    "To solve this problem, we need to reverse the given list of words. The list provided is:\n\n- name\n- Gutenberg\n- when\n- upward\n- Gutenberg\n- all\n- Then\n\nThe task is to reverse the order of these words. We can achieve this by using Python's list slicing feature, which allows us to reverse a list efficiently.\n\nLet's write a Python script to reverse the list and print the result.\n\n```python\n# Original list of words\nwords = [\"name\", \"Gutenberg\", \"when\", \"upward\", \"Gutenberg\", \"all\", \"Then\"]\n\n# Reverse the list\nreversed_words = words[::-1]\n\n# Print the reversed list as a comma-separated string\nprint(\", \".join(reversed_words))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the reversed list.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the reversed list of words. Now, I will present the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<Then, all, Gutenberg, upward, when, Gutenberg, name>>>"
