    "To solve this problem, we need to reverse the order of the words in the given list. The list of words is: \n\n- inventors\n- 25th\n- no\n- interesting\n- certainly\n- I\n- at\n- copyright\n\nThe task is to reverse the order of these words. We can achieve this by using Python to manipulate the list and reverse it. Let's write a Python script to perform this task.\n\n```python\n# Define the list of words\nwords = [\"inventors\", \"25th\", \"no\", \"interesting\", \"certainly\", \"I\", \"at\", \"copyright\"]\n\n# Reverse the list\nreversed_words = list(reversed(words))\n\n# Print the reversed list as a comma-separated string\nprint(\", \".join(reversed_words))\n```\n\nThis script will reverse the list and print the words in the required format. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and reversed the list of words as intended. Now, I will provide the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<copyright, at, I, certainly, interesting, no, 25th, inventors>>>"
