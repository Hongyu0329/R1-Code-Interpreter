    "To solve this problem, we need to reverse the order of the words in the given list. The list of words is: \"of, 1100, us, specifically, can, Project, Fritz\". \n\nThe task is straightforward: we will reverse the order of these words and then format the output as a comma-separated list with a space after each comma, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform this task:\n\n```python\n# Original list of words\nwords = [\"of\", \"1100\", \"us\", \"specifically\", \"can\", \"Project\", \"Fritz\"]\n\n# Reverse the list\nreversed_words = words[::-1]\n\n# Join the reversed list into a string with the required format\nresult = ', '.join(reversed_words)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to get the reversed list of words.",
