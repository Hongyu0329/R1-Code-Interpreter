    "To solve this problem, we need to reverse the order of the words in the given list. The list of words provided is: \"at, into, least, as\". \n\nThe task is straightforward: we need to reverse the order of these words. The original order is:\n1. at\n2. into\n3. least\n4. as\n\nReversing this order will give us:\n1. as\n2. least\n3. into\n4. at\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to perform this operation and print the reversed list of words.\n\n```python\n# Original list of words\nwords = [\"at\", \"into\", \"least\", \"as\"]\n\n# Reverse the list\nreversed_words = list(reversed(words))\n\n# Print the reversed list as a comma-separated string\nprint(\", \".join(reversed_words))\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the reversed list of words. Let's see the output.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the reversed list of words as expected. The reversed order of the words is \"as, least, into, at\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<as, least, into, at>>>"
