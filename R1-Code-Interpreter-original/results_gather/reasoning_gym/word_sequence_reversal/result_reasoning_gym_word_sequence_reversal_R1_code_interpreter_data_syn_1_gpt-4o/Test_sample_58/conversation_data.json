    "To solve this problem, we need to reverse the given list of words. The list provided is: [\"to\", \"a\", \"a\", \"the\"]. \n\nReversing a list means that the last element becomes the first, the second last becomes the second, and so on. In Python, we can easily reverse a list using slicing or the `reverse()` method. \n\nLet's write a Python script to reverse the list and print the result.\n\n```python\n# Original list of words\nwords = [\"to\", \"a\", \"a\", \"the\"]\n\n# Reversing the list\nreversed_words = words[::-1]\n\n# Printing the reversed list\nprint(reversed_words)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will give us the reversed list.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the reversed list of words. Now, I will format the output as a comma-separated list of words with a space after each comma, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe reversed list is: ['the', 'a', 'a', 'to']\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<the, a, a, to>>>"
