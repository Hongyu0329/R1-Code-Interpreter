    "To solve this problem, we need to reverse the order of the words in the given list. The list of words is: \"Madrid, Smith, it\". \n\nThe steps to solve this are:\n1. Split the string into individual words.\n2. Reverse the order of these words.\n3. Join them back into a single string with the specified format.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these steps:\n\n```python\n# Original list of words\nwords = \"Madrid, Smith, it\"\n\n# Split the words by comma and strip any extra spaces\nword_list = [word.strip() for word in words.split(',')]\n\n# Reverse the list of words\nreversed_list = word_list[::-1]\n\n# Join the reversed list into a string with the specified format\nresult = ', '.join(reversed_list)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to get the reversed list of words.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the reversed list of words. Now, I will present the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<it, Smith, Madrid>>>"
