    "To solve this problem, we need to reverse the order of the words in the given list. The list of words is: \"OR, Foundation, men, are, Mr\". \n\nThe task is straightforward: we will reverse the order of these words and then provide the result in the specified format.\n\nLet's write a Python script to reverse the list of words and print the result.\n\n```python\n# Original list of words\nwords = [\"OR\", \"Foundation\", \"men\", \"are\", \"Mr\"]\n\n# Reverse the list\nreversed_words = words[::-1]\n\n# Print the reversed list as a comma-separated string\nprint(\", \".join(reversed_words))\n```\n\nThis script will reverse the list and print the words in the required format. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
