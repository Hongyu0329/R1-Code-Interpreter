    "To solve this problem, we need to reverse the given list of words. The list provided is: \n\n1. \"1\"\n2. \"are\"\n3. \"must\"\n4. \"receipt\"\n5. \"were\"\n6. \"Verne\"\n7. \"no\"\n\nThe task is to reverse the order of these words. We can achieve this by using Python to manipulate the list and print the reversed order.\n\nLet's write a Python script to reverse the list and print the result.\n\n```python\n# Original list of words\nwords = [\"1\", \"are\", \"must\", \"receipt\", \"were\", \"Verne\", \"no\"]\n\n# Reverse the list\nreversed_words = list(reversed(words))\n\n# Print the reversed list as a comma-separated string\nprint(\", \".join(reversed_words))\n```\n\nThis script will reverse the list and print the words in the required format. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the reversed list of words. Now, I will present the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<no, Verne, were, receipt, must, are, 1>>>"
