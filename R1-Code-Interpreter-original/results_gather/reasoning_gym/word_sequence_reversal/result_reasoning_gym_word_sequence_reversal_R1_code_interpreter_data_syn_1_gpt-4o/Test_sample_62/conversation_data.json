    "To solve this problem, we need to reverse the order of the words in the given list. The list of words is: \"Smith, of, to, for, display, comprehend, any\". \n\nThe task is straightforward: we will reverse the list and then format the output as a comma-separated list of words with a space after each comma.\n\nLet's write a Python script to reverse the list and print the result in the required format.\n\n```python\n# Original list of words\nwords = [\"Smith\", \"of\", \"to\", \"for\", \"display\", \"comprehend\", \"any\"]\n\n# Reverse the list\nreversed_words = words[::-1]\n\n# Join the reversed list into a string with the required format\nresult = \", \".join(reversed_words)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the reversed list.",
    "The code executed successfully and reversed the list of words as required. The output is a comma-separated list of words in reverse order.\n\nThe final answer, formatted as requested, is:\n\n<<<any, comprehend, display, for, to, of, Smith>>>"
