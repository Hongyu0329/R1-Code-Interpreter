    "To solve this problem, we need to reverse the order of the words in the given list. The list of words is: \"said\", \"give\", \"And\". \n\nThe reversed order of these words should be: \"And\", \"give\", \"said\".\n\nLet's implement this in Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Original list of words\nwords = [\"said\", \"give\", \"And\"]\n\n# Reversing the list\nreversed_words = list(reversed(words))\n\n# Printing the reversed list as a comma-separated string\nprint(\", \".join(reversed_words))\n```\n\nExecuting the above code will give us the reversed list of words.",
