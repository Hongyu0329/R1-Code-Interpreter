    "To solve the problem of reversing the list of words, we need to take the given list and reverse the order of the words. The list provided is: \"readable, to, he, that, to, possession\".\n\nThe steps to solve this problem are as follows:\n1. Split the string into a list of words.\n2. Reverse the list.\n3. Join the reversed list back into a string with the same format as the input.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Original list of words\nwords = \"readable, to, he, that, to, possession\"\n\n# Split the string into a list of words\nwords_list = words.split(\", \")\n\n# Reverse the list\nreversed_list = words_list[::-1]\n\n# Join the reversed list back into a string\nreversed_string = \", \".join(reversed_list)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(reversed_string)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the reversed list of words.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the reversed list of words. Now, I will present the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<possession, to, that, he, to, readable>>>"
