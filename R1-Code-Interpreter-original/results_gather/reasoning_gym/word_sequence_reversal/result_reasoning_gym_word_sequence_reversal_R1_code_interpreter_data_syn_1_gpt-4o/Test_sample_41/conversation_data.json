    "To solve this problem, we need to reverse the order of the words in the given list. The list of words is: \"you, of, to, what, Gutenberg\". \n\nThe task is straightforward: we need to reverse the order of these words and then provide the result in the specified format. \n\nLet's write a Python script to reverse the list of words and print the result.\n\n```python\n# Original list of words\nwords = [\"you\", \"of\", \"to\", \"what\", \"Gutenberg\"]\n\n# Reverse the list\nreversed_words = list(reversed(words))\n\n# Join the reversed list into a string with the specified format\nresult = \", \".join(reversed_words)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the reversed list of words.",
