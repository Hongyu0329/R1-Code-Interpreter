    "To solve this problem, we need to reverse the order of the words in the given list. The list of words is: \n\n- a\n- so\n- cannot\n- BE\n- gone\n- more\n- mere\n- mercy\n\nReversing the list means that the last word will become the first, the second last will become the second, and so on. \n\nLet's write a Python script to reverse this list of words and print the result.\n\n```python\n# Original list of words\nwords = [\"a\", \"so\", \"cannot\", \"BE\", \"gone\", \"more\", \"mere\", \"mercy\"]\n\n# Reverse the list\nreversed_words = list(reversed(words))\n\n# Print the reversed list as a comma-separated string\nprint(\", \".join(reversed_words))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to get the reversed list of words.",
