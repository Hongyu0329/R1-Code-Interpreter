    "To solve this problem, we need to reverse the given list of words. The list provided is: [\"obtaining\", \"having\", \"of\", \"3\"]. \n\nThe task is straightforward: we need to reverse the order of the words in the list. The reversed list should be: [\"3\", \"of\", \"having\", \"obtaining\"].\n\nLet's write a simple Python script to reverse the list and print the result.\n\n```python\n# Original list of words\nwords = [\"obtaining\", \"having\", \"of\", \"3\"]\n\n# Reverse the list\nreversed_words = list(reversed(words))\n\n# Print the reversed list\nprint(reversed_words)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the reversed list.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the reversed list of words. Now, we need to format the output as a comma-separated list of words with a space after each comma, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe reversed list is: ['3', 'of', 'having', 'obtaining']\n\nFormatted as a comma-separated list, it becomes: 3, of, having, obtaining\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3, of, having, obtaining>>>"
