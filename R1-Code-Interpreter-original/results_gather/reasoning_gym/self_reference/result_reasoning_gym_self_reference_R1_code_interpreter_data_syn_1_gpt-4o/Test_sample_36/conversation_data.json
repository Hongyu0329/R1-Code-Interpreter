    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means the number of true statements (T) is 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 7 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This is trivially true because there are only 7 statements, so at most 7 can be false.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means T = 4.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means the number of false statements (F) is 3, so T = 4.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This means either T = 4 (from Statement 3) or F = 3 (from Statement 4), but not both. However, both conditions imply T = 4, so this statement is false.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - Prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. So T could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - Composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6. So F could be 4 or 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values for T and F:\n\n- If T = 4, then F = 3. This satisfies Statements 3 and 4, but not Statement 5.\n- If T = 5, then F = 2. This satisfies Statement 1 and Statement 6, but not Statement 7.\n- If T = 6, then F = 1. This satisfies Statement 1, but not Statement 6 or 7.\n- If T = 7, then F = 0. This satisfies Statement 1, but not Statement 6 or 7.\n\nWe need to find the number of solutions where all statements are consistent. Let's write a Python script to check the consistency of these statements for each possible value of T.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\npossible_solutions = 0\n\nfor T in range(8):\n    F = 7 - T\n    statement_1 = T >= 4\n    statement_2 = F <= 7\n    statement_3 = T == 4\n    statement_4 = F == 3\n    statement_5 = (statement_3 or statement_4) and not (statement_3 and statement_4)\n    statement_6 = is_prime(T)\n    statement_7 = is_composite(F)\n    \n    if all([statement_1, statement_2, statement_5, statement_6, statement_7]):\n        possible_solutions += 1\n\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "The code output indicates that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements. Let's review the logic to ensure everything is correct.\n\n1. **Statement 1**: T must be at least 4.\n2. **Statement 2**: F can be at most 7, which is always true.\n3. **Statement 3**: T must be exactly 4.\n4. **Statement 4**: F must be exactly 3, which implies T = 4.\n5. **Statement 5**: Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. However, both imply T = 4, so this statement is false.\n6. **Statement 6**: T must be a prime number (2, 3, 5, 7).\n7. **Statement 7**: F must be a composite number (4, 6).\n\nGiven these conditions, let's analyze:\n\n- If T = 4, then F = 3. This satisfies Statements 3 and 4, but not Statement 5.\n- If T = 5, then F = 2. This satisfies Statement 1 and Statement 6, but not Statement 7.\n- If T = 6, then F = 1. This satisfies Statement 1, but not Statement 6 or 7.\n- If T = 7, then F = 0. This satisfies Statement 1, but not Statement 6 or 7.\n\nThe code correctly checks these conditions, and the result of 0 indicates that no combination of T and F satisfies all the statements simultaneously.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
