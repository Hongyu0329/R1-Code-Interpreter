    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means the number of true statements (T) is at least 2.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means the number of false statements (F) is at most 3, so T ≥ 4.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means T = 4.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means F = 3, so T = 4.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This means either T = 4 or F = 3, but not both. However, since T = 4 implies F = 3, this statement is contradictory unless both are false.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - Possible prime numbers for T are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - Possible composite numbers for F are 4, 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If T = 4, then F = 3. This satisfies Statements 3 and 4, but contradicts Statement 5.\n- If T = 5, then F = 2. This satisfies Statement 6, but not Statement 7.\n- If T = 6, then F = 1. This satisfies neither Statement 6 nor Statement 7.\n- If T = 7, then F = 0. This satisfies Statement 6, but not Statement 7.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's write a Python script to check all possible combinations of true and false statements to find the number of valid solutions.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\npossible_solutions = 0\n\nfor T in range(2, 8):  # T can be from 2 to 7\n    F = 7 - T\n    if T >= 2 and F <= 3:  # Statement 1 and 2\n        if (T == 4 and F != 3) or (F == 3 and T != 4):  # Statement 5\n            if is_prime(T) and is_composite(F):  # Statement 6 and 7\n                possible_solutions += 1\n\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code output indicates that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's review the logic to ensure everything is correct.\n\n1. **Statement 1**: At least 2 statements are true, so T ≥ 2.\n2. **Statement 2**: At most 3 statements are false, so F ≤ 3, which implies T ≥ 4.\n3. **Statement 3**: Exactly 4 statements are true, so T = 4.\n4. **Statement 4**: Exactly 3 statements are false, so F = 3, which implies T = 4.\n5. **Statement 5**: Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This is contradictory if T = 4.\n6. **Statement 6**: The number of true statements is a prime number. Possible values for T are 2, 3, 5, 7.\n7. **Statement 7**: The number of false statements is a composite number. Possible values for F are 4, 6.\n\nGiven these constraints, the code correctly checks all possible values of T from 2 to 7 and finds that no combination satisfies all conditions simultaneously. Therefore, the conclusion is that there are no possible solutions.\n\n<<<0>>>"
