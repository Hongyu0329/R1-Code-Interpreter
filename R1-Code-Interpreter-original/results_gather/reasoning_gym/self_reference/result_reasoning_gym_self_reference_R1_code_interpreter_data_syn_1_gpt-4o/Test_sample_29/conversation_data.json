    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This implies that there are either 6 or 7 true statements.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This implies that there are 0, 1, 2, or 3 false statements, which means there are 4, 5, 6, or 7 true statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This implies that there are 4 true statements.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This implies that there are 4 true statements.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This implies that either Statement 3 is true or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Since both statements imply 4 true statements, this condition is automatically satisfied if there are 4 true statements.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - The prime numbers between 1 and 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - The composite numbers between 0 and 6 are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If there are 6 true statements:\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is true.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is false (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is true (6 is not a prime number, so this is false).\n  - Statement 7 is false (1 false statement is not a composite number).\n\n- If there are 7 true statements:\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is false (since there are 0 false statements).\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is false (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is false (7 is a prime number, so this is true).\n  - Statement 7 is false (0 false statements is not a composite number).\n\n- If there are 5 true statements:\n  - Statement 1 is false.\n  - Statement 2 is true.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is false (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is true (5 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (2 false statements is not a composite number).\n\n- If there are 4 true statements:\n  - Statement 1 is false.\n  - Statement 2 is true.\n  - Statement 3 is true.\n  - Statement 4 is true.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both).\n  - Statement 6 is false (4 is not a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (3 false statements is a composite number).\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to check these conditions and find the number of possible solutions.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\npossible_solutions = 0\n\nfor true_statements in range(8):\n    false_statements = 7 - true_statements\n    \n    statement_1 = true_statements >= 6\n    statement_2 = false_statements <= 3\n    statement_3 = true_statements == 4\n    statement_4 = false_statements == 3\n    statement_5 = (statement_3 or statement_4) and not (statement_3 and statement_4)\n    statement_6 = is_prime(true_statements)\n    statement_7 = is_composite(false_statements)\n    \n    if (statement_1 + statement_2 + statement_3 + statement_4 + statement_5 + statement_6 + statement_7) == true_statements:\n        possible_solutions += 1\n\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "The code execution indicates that there are 2 possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. \n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
