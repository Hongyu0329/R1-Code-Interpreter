    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means the number of true statements (T) is at least 2.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means the number of false statements (F) is at most 5, or equivalently, T is at least 2.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means T = 4.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means F = 3, or equivalently, T = 4.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This means either T = 4 (Statement 3 is true) or T = 4 (Statement 4 is true), but not both. However, since both statements imply T = 4, this condition is always satisfied if T = 4.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - This means T is a prime number. The possible prime numbers for T (given 1 ≤ T ≤ 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - This means F is a composite number. The possible composite numbers for F (given 0 ≤ F ≤ 7) are 4, 6, and 8.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values of T and F:\n\n- If T = 2, then F = 5. T is prime, and F is composite. This satisfies all conditions.\n- If T = 3, then F = 4. T is prime, and F is composite. This satisfies all conditions.\n- If T = 4, then F = 3. T is not prime, so this does not satisfy all conditions.\n- If T = 5, then F = 2. T is prime, but F is not composite. This does not satisfy all conditions.\n- If T = 6, then F = 1. T is not prime, so this does not satisfy all conditions.\n- If T = 7, then F = 0. T is prime, but F is not composite. This does not satisfy all conditions.\n\nFrom this analysis, the possible solutions are when T = 2 or T = 3. Let's count these solutions:\n\n```python\n# Possible values for T and F\npossible_solutions = 0\n\n# Check each possible value of T\nfor T in range(1, 8):\n    F = 7 - T\n    # Check if T is prime\n    if T in [2, 3, 5, 7]:\n        # Check if F is composite\n        if F in [4, 6, 8]:\n            possible_solutions += 1\n\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we find the number of possible solutions. Let's see the result.",
    "The code execution indicates that there is only one possible solution that satisfies all the given conditions. \n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
