    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.'\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.'\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.'\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.'\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n\nWe need to find the number of true statements (T) and false statements (F) such that all these conditions are satisfied. Since there are 7 statements, T + F = 7.\n\nLet's analyze the constraints:\n\n- **Statement 1** implies T ≥ 4.\n- **Statement 2** implies F ≤ 1, which means T ≥ 6.\n- **Statement 3** implies T = 5.\n- **Statement 4** implies F = 2, which means T = 5.\n- **Statement 5** implies either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This means T = 5.\n- **Statement 6** implies T is a prime number. The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n- **Statement 7** implies F is a composite number. The composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6.\n\nFrom these constraints, we can see that T = 5 is the only value that satisfies Statements 3, 4, and 5. However, we need to check if it satisfies all other conditions.\n\nLet's verify:\n\n- If T = 5, then F = 2. \n- Statement 1 is satisfied because 5 ≥ 4.\n- Statement 2 is not satisfied because F = 2, which is not ≤ 1.\n- Statement 3 is satisfied because T = 5.\n- Statement 4 is satisfied because F = 2.\n- Statement 5 is satisfied because either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n- Statement 6 is satisfied because 5 is a prime number.\n- Statement 7 is satisfied because 2 is not a composite number.\n\nSince Statement 2 is not satisfied, T = 5 is not a valid solution. Let's check other possible values of T.\n\n- If T = 6, then F = 1.\n- Statement 1 is satisfied because 6 ≥ 4.\n- Statement 2 is satisfied because F = 1, which is ≤ 1.\n- Statement 3 is not satisfied because T ≠ 5.\n- Statement 4 is not satisfied because F ≠ 2.\n- Statement 5 is satisfied because neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true.\n- Statement 6 is satisfied because 6 is not a prime number.\n- Statement 7 is not satisfied because 1 is not a composite number.\n\nSince Statement 7 is not satisfied, T = 6 is not a valid solution.\n\n- If T = 7, then F = 0.\n- Statement 1 is satisfied because 7 ≥ 4.\n- Statement 2 is satisfied because F = 0, which is ≤ 1.\n- Statement 3 is not satisfied because T ≠ 5.\n- Statement 4 is not satisfied because F ≠ 2.\n- Statement 5 is satisfied because neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true.\n- Statement 6 is satisfied because 7 is a prime number.\n- Statement 7 is not satisfied because 0 is not a composite number.\n\nSince Statement 7 is not satisfied, T = 7 is not a valid solution.\n\nNow, let's check if there are any other possible values of T that satisfy all conditions. We will use a Python script to verify this.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\npossible_solutions = 0\n\nfor T in range(8):\n    F = 7 - T\n    if (T >= 4 and F <= 1 and (T == 5 or F == 2) and (T == 5) and is_prime(T) and is_composite(F)):\n        possible_solutions += 1\n\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "The code output indicates that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's review the logic and constraints to ensure everything is correctly implemented.\n\nUpon reviewing the constraints and the logic, it seems that the conditions are quite restrictive, and the analysis shows that no combination of true and false statements satisfies all the conditions simultaneously.\n\nHere's a summary of the constraints:\n\n- **Statement 1**: T ≥ 4\n- **Statement 2**: F ≤ 1 (T ≥ 6)\n- **Statement 3**: T = 5\n- **Statement 4**: F = 2 (T = 5)\n- **Statement 5**: Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both (T = 5)\n- **Statement 6**: T is a prime number\n- **Statement 7**: F is a composite number\n\nThe analysis shows that:\n\n- T = 5 satisfies Statements 3, 4, and 5, but not Statement 2.\n- T = 6 satisfies Statements 1, 2, and 5, but not Statement 7.\n- T = 7 satisfies Statements 1, 2, 5, and 6, but not Statement 7.\n\nGiven these constraints, there are indeed no possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions simultaneously.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
