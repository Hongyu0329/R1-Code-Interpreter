    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means the number of true statements (T) is 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 7 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This is always true because there are only 7 statements, so the number of false statements (F) can be 0 to 7.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means T = 2.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means F = 2, which implies T = 5.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This means either T = 2 or T = 5, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - Prime numbers between 0 and 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - Composite numbers between 0 and 7 are 4, 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values for T and F:\n\n- If T = 2, then F = 5. This satisfies Statement 3, but not Statement 4. It also satisfies Statement 5. However, F = 5 is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false. T = 2 is a prime number, so Statement 6 is true. This combination does not satisfy all conditions.\n\n- If T = 3, then F = 4. This does not satisfy Statement 3 or 4, so Statement 5 is false. T = 3 is a prime number, so Statement 6 is true. F = 4 is a composite number, so Statement 7 is true. This combination satisfies all conditions except Statement 5.\n\n- If T = 5, then F = 2. This satisfies Statement 4, but not Statement 3. It also satisfies Statement 5. T = 5 is a prime number, so Statement 6 is true. F = 2 is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false. This combination does not satisfy all conditions.\n\n- If T = 7, then F = 0. This does not satisfy Statement 3 or 4, so Statement 5 is false. T = 7 is a prime number, so Statement 6 is true. F = 0 is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false. This combination does not satisfy all conditions.\n\nLet's write a Python script to check all possible combinations of true and false statements to find the number of solutions that satisfy all conditions.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\npossible_solutions = 0\n\nfor T in range(8):\n    F = 7 - T\n    statement1 = T >= 3\n    statement2 = F <= 7\n    statement3 = T == 2\n    statement4 = F == 2\n    statement5 = (statement3 or statement4) and not (statement3 and statement4)\n    statement6 = is_prime(T)\n    statement7 = is_composite(F)\n    \n    if statement1 and statement2 and statement5 and statement6 and statement7:\n        possible_solutions += 1\n\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "The code output indicates that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's review the logic to ensure that all conditions are correctly implemented:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: At least 3 statements are true.\n2. **Statement 2**: At most 7 statements are false (always true).\n3. **Statement 3**: Exactly 2 statements are true.\n4. **Statement 4**: Exactly 2 statements are false.\n5. **Statement 5**: Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n6. **Statement 6**: The number of true statements is a prime number.\n7. **Statement 7**: The number of false statements is a composite number.\n\nThe code correctly checks each condition, but let's verify the logic:\n\n- **T = 2**: Satisfies Statement 3, but not Statement 4. F = 5 is not composite, so Statement 7 is false.\n- **T = 3**: Does not satisfy Statement 3 or 4, so Statement 5 is false. F = 4 is composite, so Statement 7 is true.\n- **T = 5**: Satisfies Statement 4, but not Statement 3. F = 2 is not composite, so Statement 7 is false.\n- **T = 7**: Does not satisfy Statement 3 or 4, so Statement 5 is false. F = 0 is not composite, so Statement 7 is false.\n\nThe code correctly identifies that no combination satisfies all conditions simultaneously. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is indeed zero.\n\n<<<0>>>"
