    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - If this statement is true, then there are either 6 or 7 true statements.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 4 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - If this statement is true, then there are 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 false statements, which means there are 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 true statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - If this statement is true, then there are exactly 5 true statements.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This statement cannot be true because it would mean all statements are false, including itself, which is a contradiction.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - Since Statement 4 cannot be true, this implies that if Statement 5 is true, then Statement 3 must be true.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements are 4, 6, and 8.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If there are 7 true statements, then Statement 4 is false, which is consistent. However, Statement 6 would be false because 7 is a prime number, and Statement 7 would be false because 0 is not a composite number. This scenario is not possible.\n\n- If there are 6 true statements, then Statement 4 is false, which is consistent. However, Statement 6 would be false because 6 is not a prime number, and Statement 7 would be false because 1 is not a composite number. This scenario is not possible.\n\n- If there are 5 true statements, then Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is false, and Statement 5 is true. Statement 6 is true because 5 is a prime number, and Statement 7 is true because 2 is not a composite number. This scenario is possible.\n\n- If there are 4 true statements, then Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, and Statement 5 is false. Statement 6 is false because 4 is not a prime number, and Statement 7 is true because 3 is not a composite number. This scenario is not possible.\n\n- If there are 3 true statements, then Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, and Statement 5 is false. Statement 6 is true because 3 is a prime number, and Statement 7 is true because 4 is a composite number. This scenario is possible.\n\n- If there are 2 true statements, then Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, and Statement 5 is false. Statement 6 is true because 2 is a prime number, and Statement 7 is true because 5 is not a composite number. This scenario is not possible.\n\n- If there is 1 true statement, then Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, and Statement 5 is false. Statement 6 is false because 1 is not a prime number, and Statement 7 is true because 6 is a composite number. This scenario is not possible.\n\n- If there are 0 true statements, then Statement 4 is false, which is a contradiction. This scenario is not possible.\n\nFrom the analysis, the possible scenarios are when there are 5 true statements or 3 true statements. Let's count these scenarios:\n\n```python\n# Possible scenarios\npossible_scenarios = 0\n\n# Check for 5 true statements\nif 5 in [2, 3, 5, 7]:  # Prime numbers\n    if 2 in [4, 6, 8]:  # Composite numbers\n        possible_scenarios += 1\n\n# Check for 3 true statements\nif 3 in [2, 3, 5, 7]:  # Prime numbers\n    if 4 in [4, 6, 8]:  # Composite numbers\n        possible_scenarios += 1\n\nprint(possible_scenarios)\n```\n\nThe code will determine the number of possible solutions based on the analysis above.",
    "Based on the analysis and the code execution, there is only one possible solution that satisfies all the given conditions. \n\nThe scenario where there are 3 true statements and 4 false statements is the only valid solution. This satisfies the conditions that the number of true statements is a prime number (3) and the number of false statements is a composite number (4).\n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
