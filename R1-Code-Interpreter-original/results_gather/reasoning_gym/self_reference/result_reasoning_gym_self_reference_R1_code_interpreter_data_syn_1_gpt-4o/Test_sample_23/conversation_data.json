    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means the number of true statements (T) is 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means the number of false statements (F) is 0 or 1, which implies T is 6 or 7.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 6 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means T = 6.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means F = 2, which implies T = 5.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This means either T = 6 or T = 5, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - Possible prime numbers for T are 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - Possible composite numbers for F are 4, 6, 8, etc.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values for T and F:\n\n- If T = 6, then F = 1. This satisfies Statement 3, but not Statement 4. It also satisfies Statement 2, but not Statement 7 (since 1 is not composite).\n- If T = 5, then F = 2. This satisfies Statement 4, but not Statement 3. It also satisfies Statement 1, Statement 5, and Statement 6 (since 5 is prime), but not Statement 2.\n- If T = 7, then F = 0. This satisfies Statement 2, but not Statement 6 (since 7 is prime, but F is not composite).\n\nLet's write a Python script to check these conditions and find the number of possible solutions.\n\n```python\ndef check_statements():\n    possible_solutions = 0\n    for T in range(8):\n        F = 7 - T\n        # Check each statement\n        s1 = (T >= 3)\n        s2 = (F <= 1)\n        s3 = (T == 6)\n        s4 = (F == 2)\n        s5 = (s3 != s4)\n        s6 = (T in [2, 3, 5, 7])\n        s7 = (F in [4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14])  # Composite numbers\n\n        # Check if all statements are consistent\n        if s1 and s2 and s5 and s6 and s7:\n            possible_solutions += 1\n\n    print(possible_solutions)\n\ncheck_statements()\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "The code output indicates that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements. Let's re-evaluate the conditions and logic to ensure everything is correctly implemented.\n\nUpon reviewing the logic, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the statements. Let's re-evaluate the conditions:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: T >= 3\n2. **Statement 2**: F <= 1\n3. **Statement 3**: T == 6\n4. **Statement 4**: F == 2\n5. **Statement 5**: (T == 6) != (F == 2)\n6. **Statement 6**: T is a prime number (2, 3, 5, 7)\n7. **Statement 7**: F is a composite number (4, 6, 8, etc.)\n\nLet's re-implement the logic and check for any inconsistencies:\n\n```python\ndef check_statements():\n    possible_solutions = 0\n    for T in range(8):\n        F = 7 - T\n        # Check each statement\n        s1 = (T >= 3)\n        s2 = (F <= 1)\n        s3 = (T == 6)\n        s4 = (F == 2)\n        s5 = (s3 != s4)\n        s6 = (T in [2, 3, 5, 7])\n        s7 = (F in [4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14])  # Composite numbers\n\n        # Check if all statements are consistent\n        if s1 and s2 and s3 and s4 and s5 and s6 and s7:\n            possible_solutions += 1\n\n    print(possible_solutions)\n\ncheck_statements()\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the number of possible solutions.",
    "The output of 0 indicates that there are no solutions that satisfy all the conditions simultaneously. Let's carefully re-evaluate the logic and constraints to ensure we are interpreting the statements correctly.\n\nUpon reviewing the problem, it seems there might be a logical contradiction in the statements themselves, which could lead to no possible solutions. Let's analyze the constraints again:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: T >= 3\n2. **Statement 2**: F <= 1\n3. **Statement 3**: T == 6\n4. **Statement 4**: F == 2\n5. **Statement 5**: (T == 6) != (F == 2)\n6. **Statement 6**: T is a prime number (2, 3, 5, 7)\n7. **Statement 7**: F is a composite number (4, 6, 8, etc.)\n\nLet's consider the possible values for T and F:\n\n- If T = 6, then F = 1. This satisfies Statement 3, but not Statement 4. It satisfies Statement 2, but not Statement 7 (since 1 is not composite).\n- If T = 5, then F = 2. This satisfies Statement 4, but not Statement 3. It satisfies Statement 1, Statement 5, and Statement 6 (since 5 is prime), but not Statement 2.\n- If T = 7, then F = 0. This satisfies Statement 2, but not Statement 6 (since 7 is prime, but F is not composite).\n\nGiven these constraints, it seems that the statements are inherently contradictory, leading to no possible solutions. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is indeed 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
