    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine how many of them can be true simultaneously. Let's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.\"  \n   - This implies all statements are true.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 7 of these 7 statements are false.\"  \n   - This is trivially true because there are only 7 statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.\"  \n   - This implies that 2 statements are false.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are false.\"  \n   - This implies all statements are true.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"  \n   - This means if Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 must be false, and vice versa.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"  \n   - Possible prime numbers for 7 statements are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"  \n   - Possible composite numbers for 7 statements are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the possible scenarios:\n\n- If Statement 1 is true, then all statements are true. This contradicts Statement 5, which requires either Statement 3 or 4 to be true, but not both. Also, Statement 6 would be true (7 is prime), but Statement 7 would be false (0 is not composite).\n\n- If Statement 3 is true, then 5 statements are true, and 2 are false. This satisfies Statement 5 (since Statement 4 is false). Statement 6 is true (5 is prime), and Statement 7 is true (2 is composite).\n\n- If Statement 4 is true, then all statements are true, which contradicts Statement 5.\n\n- If Statement 6 is true, the number of true statements must be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n- If Statement 7 is true, the number of false statements must be 4 or 6.\n\nLet's check the scenario where Statement 3 is true:\n\n- True statements: 5\n- False statements: 2\n- Statement 5 is satisfied because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 6 is satisfied because 5 is a prime number.\n- Statement 7 is satisfied because 2 is a composite number.\n\nThis scenario seems consistent. Let's verify if there are any other possible solutions by checking other combinations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import isprime\n\ndef check_statements():\n    possible_solutions = 0\n    for true_count in range(8):\n        false_count = 7 - true_count\n        # Check each statement\n        s1 = (true_count >= 7)\n        s2 = (false_count <= 7)\n        s3 = (true_count == 5)\n        s4 = (false_count == 0)\n        s5 = (s3 != s4)\n        s6 = isprime(true_count)\n        s7 = (false_count in [4, 6])\n        \n        # Count valid solutions\n        if all([s1, s2, s3, s4, s5, s6, s7]):\n            possible_solutions += 1\n    return possible_solutions\n\nprint(check_statements())\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "It seems there was an error in the logic of the code. Let's re-evaluate the conditions and correct the code.\n\nThe key points to consider are:\n- Statement 1 and Statement 4 both imply all statements are true, which contradicts Statement 5.\n- Statement 3 implies exactly 5 statements are true, which satisfies Statement 5 if Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 6 requires the number of true statements to be a prime number.\n- Statement 7 requires the number of false statements to be a composite number.\n\nLet's correct the code to reflect these conditions:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import isprime\n\ndef check_statements():\n    possible_solutions = 0\n    for true_count in range(8):\n        false_count = 7 - true_count\n        # Check each statement\n        s1 = (true_count >= 7)\n        s2 = (false_count <= 7)\n        s3 = (true_count == 5)\n        s4 = (false_count == 0)\n        s5 = (s3 != s4)\n        s6 = isprime(true_count)\n        s7 = (false_count in [4, 6])\n        \n        # Count valid solutions\n        if s2 and s5 and s6 and s7:\n            possible_solutions += 1\n    return possible_solutions\n\nprint(check_statements())\n```\n\nLet's execute this corrected code to find the number of possible solutions.",
