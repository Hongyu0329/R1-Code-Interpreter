    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means the number of true statements (T) is 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means the number of false statements (F) is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means T = 0.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means F = 3.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This means either T = 0 or F = 3, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - This means T is a prime number (2, 3, 5, or 7).\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - This means F is a composite number (4, 6).\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If Statement 3 is true (T = 0), then all other statements must be false, which contradicts Statement 1 and Statement 2. Therefore, Statement 3 cannot be true.\n\n- If Statement 4 is true (F = 3), then T = 4. This satisfies Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 6 (since 4 is not a prime number, Statement 6 is false, which is consistent with having 3 false statements). However, Statement 7 would be false because 3 is not a composite number.\n\n- Statement 5 requires that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Since Statement 3 cannot be true, Statement 4 must be true.\n\n- With Statement 4 true (F = 3), we have T = 4. This satisfies Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 5. Statement 6 is false, and Statement 7 is false, which is consistent with having 3 false statements.\n\nLet's verify this scenario with a Python script to ensure all conditions are met:\n\n```python\n# Define the statements\ndef check_statements():\n    # Possible number of true statements\n    possible_true_counts = [4, 5, 6, 7]\n    # Possible number of false statements\n    possible_false_counts = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n    # Prime numbers for true statements\n    prime_true_counts = [2, 3, 5, 7]\n    # Composite numbers for false statements\n    composite_false_counts = [4, 6]\n\n    # Check each possible number of true statements\n    for T in possible_true_counts:\n        F = 7 - T\n        # Check if the scenario satisfies all conditions\n        if (T >= 4 and F <= 5 and\n            (T == 0 or F == 3) and\n            (T in prime_true_counts) and\n            (F in composite_false_counts)):\n            return 1  # Found a valid solution\n\n    return 0  # No valid solution found\n\n# Execute the function and print the result\nprint(check_statements())\n```\n\nThe code will check the conditions and return the number of valid solutions. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "It seems there was an error in the logic of the code. Let's re-evaluate the conditions and correct the code.\n\nWe need to ensure that the conditions are checked correctly:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: T must be at least 4.\n2. **Statement 2**: F must be at most 5.\n3. **Statement 3**: T must be 0 (but we know this can't be true).\n4. **Statement 4**: F must be 3.\n5. **Statement 5**: Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.
