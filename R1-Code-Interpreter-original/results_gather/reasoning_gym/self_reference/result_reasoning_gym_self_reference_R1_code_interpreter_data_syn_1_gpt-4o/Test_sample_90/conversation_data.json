    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means the number of true statements (T) is at least 2.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means the number of false statements (F) is at most 5, which implies T ≥ 2.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means T = 5.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means F = 7, which is impossible because it contradicts the existence of true statements.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This means either T = 5 or F = 7, but not both. Since F = 7 is impossible, this implies T = 5.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - This means T is a prime number. The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - This means F is a composite number. The composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values for T and F:\n\n- If T = 5, then F = 2, which satisfies Statement 3 and Statement 5. However, F = 2 is not a composite number, so this does not satisfy Statement 7.\n\n- If T = 3, then F = 4, which satisfies Statement 6 (since 3 is prime) and Statement 7 (since 4 is composite). However, this does not satisfy Statement 3 or Statement 5.\n\n- If T = 2, then F = 5, which satisfies Statement 6 (since 2 is prime) and Statement 7 (since 5 is not composite). However, this does not satisfy Statement 3 or Statement 5.\n\n- If T = 7, then F = 0, which satisfies Statement 6 (since 7 is prime) but not Statement 7.\n\nLet's write a Python script to check these conditions and find the number of possible solutions.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\npossible_solutions = 0\n\nfor T in range(8):\n    F = 7 - T\n    if T >= 2 and F <= 5:\n        if (T == 5 or F == 7) and not (T == 5 and F == 7):\n            if is_prime(T) and is_composite(F):\n                possible_solutions += 1\n\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "The code output indicates that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's review the logic and constraints to ensure everything is correctly considered.\n\n1. **Statement 1**: T ≥ 2\n2. **Statement 2**: F ≤ 5, which implies T ≥ 2\n3. **Statement 3**: T = 5\n4. **Statement 4**: F = 7 (impossible)\n5. **Statement 5**: Either T = 5 or F = 7, but not both. Since F = 7 is impossible, T = 5.\n6. **Statement 6**: T is a prime number (2, 3, 5, 7)\n7. **Statement 7**: F is a composite number (4, 6)\n\nGiven these constraints, let's re-evaluate the possible values for T and F:\n\n- If T = 5, then F = 2. This satisfies Statement 3 and Statement 5, but F = 2 is not composite, so it doesn't satisfy Statement 7.\n\n- If T = 3, then F = 4. This satisfies Statement 6 and Statement 7, but it doesn't satisfy Statement 3 or Statement 5.\n\n- If T = 2, then F = 5. This satisfies Statement 6, but F = 5 is not composite, so it doesn't satisfy Statement 7.\n\n- If T = 7, then F = 0. This satisfies Statement 6, but not Statement 7.\n\nThe code correctly checks these conditions, and the result of 0 indicates that no combination of T and F satisfies all the statements simultaneously.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
