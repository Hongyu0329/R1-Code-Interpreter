    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine how many of these statements can be true simultaneously. Let's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   - This means the number of true statements \\( T \\geq 3 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   - This means the number of false statements \\( F \\leq 3 \\), which implies \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   - This means \\( T = 5 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   - This means \\( F = 1 \\), which implies \\( T = 6 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'  \n   - This means either \\( T = 5 \\) or \\( T = 6 \\), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'  \n   - Possible prime numbers for \\( T \\) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'  \n   - Possible composite numbers for \\( F \\) are 4, 6, etc.\n\nNow, let's analyze the constraints:\n\n- From Statement 1 and 2, we have \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n- From Statement 3, \\( T = 5 \\).\n- From Statement 4, \\( T = 6 \\).\n- From Statement 5, either \\( T = 5 \\) or \\( T = 6 \\), but not both.\n- From Statement 6, \\( T \\) must be a prime number, so \\( T = 5 \\) is valid.\n- From Statement 7, \\( F \\) must be a composite number. If \\( T = 5 \\), then \\( F = 2 \\), which is not composite. If \\( T = 6 \\), then \\( F = 1 \\), which is not composite.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's check the possible values for \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) to see if any combination satisfies all conditions. We will use a Python script to evaluate these conditions.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\npossible_solutions = 0\n\nfor T in range(8):\n    F = 7 - T\n    if T >= 4 and (T == 5 or T == 6) and is_prime(T) and is_composite(F):\n        possible_solutions += 1\n\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "The code output indicates that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's review the constraints and verify if there is any logical error in our reasoning:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \\( T \\geq 3 \\)\n2. **Statement 2**: \\( T \\geq 4 \\)\n3. **Statement 3**: \\( T = 5 \\)\n4. **Statement 4**: \\( T = 6 \\)\n5. **Statement 5**: Either \\( T = 5 \\) or \\( T = 6 \\), but not both.\n6. **Statement 6**: \\( T \\) is a prime number.\n7. **Statement 7**: \\( F \\) is a composite number.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's analyze:\n\n- If \\( T = 5 \\), then \\( F = 2 \\), which is not composite.\n- If \\( T = 6 \\), then \\( F = 1 \\), which is not composite.\n\nThe constraints from Statements 6 and 7 are conflicting with the possible values of \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) derived from other statements. Therefore, there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions simultaneously.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
