    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine how many of them can be true simultaneously. Let's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   - If this statement is true, then all 7 statements must be true. However, this creates a contradiction because Statement 3 claims that none of the statements are true.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   - If this statement is true, then at least 5 statements must be true.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   - If this statement is true, it creates a paradox because it would mean that Statement 3 itself is true, which contradicts its own claim.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   - If this statement is true, then exactly 3 statements are true.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'  \n   - This statement can only be true if one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'  \n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (out of 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'  \n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (out of 7) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If Statement 3 is true, then all statements must be false, which is a contradiction.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then exactly 3 statements are true, and 4 are false. This satisfies Statement 5 (since Statement 3 is false), Statement 6 (3 is a prime number), and Statement 7 (4 is a composite number).\n\nLet's verify this scenario with a code to ensure consistency:\n\n```python\ndef check_statements():\n    # Possible number of true statements\n    for true_count in range(8):\n        false_count = 7 - true_count\n        \n        # Check each statement\n        s1 = (true_count >= 7)\n        s2 = (false_count <= 2)\n        s3 = (true_count == 0)\n        s4 = (false_count == 4)\n        s5 = (s3 != s4)\n        s6 = (true_count in [2, 3, 5, 7])\n        s7 = (false_count in [4, 6])\n        \n        # Count how many statements are true\n        true_statements = sum([s1, s2, s3, s4, s5, s6, s7])\n        \n        # Check if the number of true statements matches the true_count\n        if true_statements == true_count:\n            print(f\"True statements: {true_count}, False statements: {false_count}\")\n\ncheck_statements()\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "The code output indicates that there is only one possible solution where the number of true statements is 1 and the number of false statements is 6. This means that only one statement can be true without causing any contradictions, and the rest must be false.\n\nGiven this result, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
