    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine how many consistent solutions exist. Let's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means the number of true statements (T) is \\( T \\geq 3 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means the number of false statements (F) is \\( F \\leq 5 \\). Since there are 7 statements in total, \\( T = 7 - F \\), so \\( T \\geq 2 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This implies all statements are true, which is a contradiction if any other statement is false.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements is false.'\n   - This implies \\( F = 1 \\) and \\( T = 6 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This means either all statements are true (Statement 3) or exactly one is false (Statement 4), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - Possible prime numbers for T are 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - Possible composite numbers for F are 4, 6, or more.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If Statement 3 is true, then all statements are true, which contradicts Statement 5.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then \\( T = 6 \\) and \\( F = 1 \\). This satisfies Statement 5, as Statement 3 is false.\n- For Statement 6 to be true, \\( T \\) must be a prime number. \\( T = 6 \\) is not prime, so Statement 6 is false.\n- For Statement 7 to be true, \\( F \\) must be a composite number. \\( F = 1 \\) is not composite, so Statement 7 is false.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's check the consistency of the statements:\n\n- If \\( T = 6 \\) and \\( F = 1 \\), then:\n  - Statement 1 is true (\\( T \\geq 3 \\)).\n  - Statement 2 is true (\\( F \\leq 5 \\)).\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is true.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false).\n  - Statement 6 is false.\n  - Statement 7 is false.\n\nThis scenario is consistent with the given conditions. Let's verify if there are any other possible solutions by checking other values of \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) that satisfy the conditions.\n\n```python\n# Check all possible values of T (number of true statements) and F (number of false statements)\n# to find consistent solutions.\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"Check if a number is prime.\"\"\"\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    \"\"\"Check if a number is composite.\"\"\"\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\npossible_solutions = 0\n\nfor T in range(8):  # T can be from 0 to 7\n    F = 7 - T\n    # Check the conditions\n    if (T >= 3 and F <= 5 and\n        ((T == 7) != (T == 6)) and  # Statement 5: Either Statement 3 or 4 is true, but not both\n        is_prime(T) and\n        is_composite(F)):\n        possible_solutions += 1\n\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nThe code will determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code output indicates that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions. Let's re-evaluate the logic and constraints to ensure we haven't missed any possibilities.\n\nUpon reviewing the conditions:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \\( T \\geq 3 \\)\n2. **Statement 2**: \\( F \\leq 5 \\) implies \\( T \\geq 2 \\)\n3. **Statement 3**: \\( T = 7 \\) (all true)\n4. **Statement 4**: \\( F = 1 \\) implies \\( T = 6 \\)\n5. **Statement 5**: Either Statement 3 or 4 is true, but not both\n6. **Statement 6**: \\( T \\) is prime\n7. **Statement 7**: \\( F \\) is composite\n\nGiven the constraints, let's re-evaluate the possible values for \\( T \\) and \\( F \\):\n\n- If \\( T = 6 \\) and \\( F = 1 \\), then:\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is true.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is true.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false).\n  - Statement 6 is false (6 is not prime).\n  - Statement 7 is false (1 is not composite).\n\nThis scenario is consistent with the conditions except for Statements 6 and 7. Let's check if there are any other possible values for \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) that might satisfy all conditions.\n\nRe-evaluating the logic, it seems that the constraints are too strict to allow any consistent solution. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is indeed zero.\n\n<<<0>>>"
