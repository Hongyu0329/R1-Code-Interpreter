    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine how many of them can be true simultaneously. Let's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   - This means that the number of true statements (T) is 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   - This means that the number of false statements (F) is 0, 1, or 2, which implies T is 5, 6, or 7.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   - This means T = 1.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   - This means T = 0.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'  \n   - This means either T = 1 or T = 0, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'  \n   - This means T is a prime number (2, 3, 5, or 7).\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'  \n   - This means F is a composite number (4, 6).\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values of T and F:\n\n- If T = 0, then F = 7, which is not composite. So, T cannot be 0.\n- If T = 1, then F = 6, which is composite. This satisfies Statement 3 and Statement 7.\n- If T = 2, then F = 5, which is not composite. So, T cannot be 2.\n- If T = 3, then F = 4, which is composite. This satisfies Statement 7.\n- If T = 4, then F = 3, which is not composite. So, T cannot be 4.\n- If T = 5, then F = 2, which is not composite. So, T cannot be 5.\n- If T = 6, then F = 1, which is not composite. So, T cannot be 6.\n- If T = 7, then F = 0, which is not composite. So, T cannot be 7.\n\nFrom the above analysis, the only possible values for T are 1 and 3. Let's check these possibilities:\n\n- **T = 1**: \n  - Satisfies Statement 3 and Statement 7.\n  - Statement 5 is satisfied because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 6 is not satisfied because 1 is not a prime number.\n  - Statement 1 and Statement 2 are not satisfied.\n\n- **T = 3**: \n  - Satisfies Statement 7.\n  - Statement 6 is not satisfied because 3 is a prime number.\n  - Statement 1 is not satisfied because at least 4 statements are not true.\n  - Statement 2 is not satisfied because at most 2 statements are not false.\n  - Statement 3 and Statement 4 are not satisfied.\n  - Statement 5 is not satisfied because neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true.\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to verify these conditions and count the number of possible solutions.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\npossible_solutions = 0\n\nfor T in range(8):\n    F = 7 - T\n    if (T >= 4 and T <= 7) and (F <= 2) and (T == 1) and (T == 0) and (T == 1 or T == 0) and (is_prime(T)) and (is_composite(F)):\n        possible_solutions += 1\n\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the number of possible solutions.",

    "The output of 0 indicates that there are no possible solutions when all conditions are required to be true simultaneously. This suggests that the conditions are too restrictive when combined in this way. Let's re-evaluate the logic to find a consistent set of true statements.\n\nThe key is to find a combination of true and false statements that satisfies the constraints without requiring all conditions to be true simultaneously. Let's analyze the conditions again:\n\n- **Statement 1** and **Statement 2** are mutually exclusive with **Statement 3** and **Statement 4**.\n- **Statement 5** requires either **Statement 3** or **Statement 4** to be true, but not both.\n- **Statement 6** and **Statement 7** provide additional constraints on the number of true and false statements.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's focus on finding a valid combination:\n\n1.

    "The output of 2 indicates that there are two possible solutions that satisfy the given conditions.
