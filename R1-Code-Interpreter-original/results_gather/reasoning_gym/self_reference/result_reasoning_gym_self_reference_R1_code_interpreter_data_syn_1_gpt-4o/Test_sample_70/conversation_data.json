    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 5 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means that the number of true statements is 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means that the number of true statements is 6 or 7.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means that the number of true statements is 5.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 6 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means that the number of true statements is 1.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This means that either the number of true statements is 5 or 1, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If Statement 3 is true, then there are exactly 5 true statements.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then there is exactly 1 true statement.\n- Statement 5 implies that only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true.\n\nLet's check the consistency of these statements by considering the number of true statements from 1 to 7 and see which combinations satisfy all the conditions.\n\nWe will write a Python script to evaluate these conditions and find the number of possible solutions.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\npossible_solutions = 0\n\nfor true_count in range(1, 8):\n    false_count = 7 - true_count\n    \n    # Check each statement\n    statement_1 = true_count >= 5\n    statement_2 = true_count >= 6\n    statement_3 = true_count == 5\n    statement_4 = true_count == 1\n    statement_5 = (statement_3 or statement_4) and not (statement_3 and statement_4)\n    statement_6 = is_prime(true_count)\n    statement_7 = is_composite(false_count)\n    \n    # Check if all conditions are satisfied\n    if (statement_1 and statement_2 and statement_5 and statement_6 and statement_7):\n        possible_solutions += 1\n\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "The code output indicates that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's review the logic to ensure it aligns with the problem's requirements:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: At least 5 statements are true.\n2. **Statement 2**: At most 1 statement is false.\n3. **Statement 3**: Exactly 5 statements are true.\n4. **Statement 4**: Exactly 6 statements are false.\n5. **Statement 5**: Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n6. **Statement 6**: The number of true statements is a prime number.\n7. **Statement 7**: The number of false statements is a composite number.\n\nGiven the constraints:\n- If Statement 3 is true, then there are exactly 5 true statements.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then there is exactly 1 true statement.\n- Statement 5 implies that only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true.\n- The number of true statements must be a prime number (2, 3, 5, 7).\n- The number of false statements must be a composite number (4, 6).\n\nLet's re-evaluate the conditions:\n\n- If there are 5 true statements:\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is false (since 2 statements are false).\n  - Statement 3 is true.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false).\n  - Statement 6 is true (5 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (2 false statements, 2 is not composite).\n\n- If there are 6 true statements:\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is true.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is false (neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is true (6 is not a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (1 false statement, 1 is not composite).\n\n- If there are 7 true statements:\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is true.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is false (neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is true (7 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is false (0 false statements, 0 is not composite).\n\nThe only consistent scenario is when there are 5 true statements, but Statement 7 fails because 2 is not composite. Therefore, there are no possible solutions that satisfy all conditions.\n\n<<<0>>>"
