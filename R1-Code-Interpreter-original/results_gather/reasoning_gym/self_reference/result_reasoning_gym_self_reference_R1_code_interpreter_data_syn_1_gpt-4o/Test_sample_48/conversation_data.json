    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   - This implies all statements are true. If this is true, then all other statements must also be true.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   - This means there can be 0, 1, or 2 false statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   - This contradicts Statement 1 if Statement 1 is true. If Statement 3 is true, then only 2 statements can be true.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   - This means 3 statements are true.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'  \n   - This is a classic XOR condition. Either Statement 3 is true, or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'  \n   - Possible prime numbers for the number of true statements are 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'  \n   - Possible composite numbers for the number of false statements are 4, 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If Statement 1 is true, then all statements are true, which contradicts Statements 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. So, Statement 1 cannot be true.\n- If Statement 2 is true, then there can be 0, 1, or 2 false statements.\n- If Statement 3 is true, then only 2 statements are true, which contradicts Statement 1 and 2.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then 3 statements are true, which is a prime number, satisfying Statement 6.\n- Statement 5 is a condition that must be checked based on the truthfulness of Statements 3 and 4.\n- Statement 6 requires the number of true statements to be a prime number.\n- Statement 7 requires the number of false statements to be a composite number.\n\nLet's write a Python script to check all possible combinations of true and false statements to find the number of solutions that satisfy all conditions.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\n# Generate all combinations of truth values for 7 statements\ncombinations = product([True, False], repeat=7)\nvalid_solutions = 0\n\nfor combo in combinations:\n    s1, s2, s3, s4, s5, s6, s7 = combo\n    true_count = sum(combo)\n    false_count = 7 - true_count\n    \n    # Check each statement's condition\n    if (s1 == (true_count >= 7) and\n        s2 == (false_count <= 2) and\n        s3 == (true_count == 2) and\n        s4 == (false_count == 4) and\n        s5 == (s3 != s4) and\n        s6 == is_prime(true_count) and\n        s7 == is_composite(false_count)):\n        valid_solutions += 1\n\nprint(valid_solutions)\n```\n\nThis code will check all possible combinations of truth values for the 7 statements and count how many satisfy all the conditions. Let's execute the code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "The code execution indicates that there are 2 possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions for the statements. \n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
