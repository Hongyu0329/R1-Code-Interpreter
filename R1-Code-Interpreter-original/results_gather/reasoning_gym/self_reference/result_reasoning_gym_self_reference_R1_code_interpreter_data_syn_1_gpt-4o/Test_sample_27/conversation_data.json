    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means there must be at least 2 true statements.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 0 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This implies that all statements must be true, which contradicts Statement 1.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means only one statement can be true.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This implies all statements are false, which is a contradiction.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This means one of these statements is true, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - Possible prime numbers for the number of true statements are 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - Possible composite numbers for the number of false statements are 4, 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If Statement 3 is true, then exactly one statement is true, which contradicts Statement 1.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then all statements are false, which is impossible.\n- If Statement 5 is true, then either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n- Statement 6 requires the number of true statements to be a prime number.\n- Statement 7 requires the number of false statements to be a composite number.\n\nLet's write a Python script to check the possible combinations of true and false statements that satisfy these conditions.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Total number of statements\nn = 7\n\n# Possible prime numbers for true statements\nprime_true_counts = {2, 3, 5, 7}\n\n# Possible composite numbers for false statements\ncomposite_false_counts = {4, 6}\n\n# Function to check if a combination of true statements is valid\ndef is_valid_combination(true_statements):\n    # Count the number of true and false statements\n    true_count = len(true_statements)\n    false_count = n - true_count\n    \n    # Check conditions\n    if true_count in prime_true_counts and false_count in composite_false_counts:\n        # Check each statement\n        s1 = true_count >= 2\n        s2 = false_count <= 0\n        s3 = true_count == 1\n        s4 = false_count == 7\n        s5 = (s3 or s4) and not (s3 and s4)\n        s6 = true_count in prime_true_counts\n        s7 = false_count in composite_false_counts\n        \n        # Return if all conditions are satisfied\n        return s1 and not s2 and not s3 and not s4 and s5 and s6 and s7\n    return False\n\n# Generate all combinations of true statements\npossible_solutions = 0\nfor r in range(1, n + 1):\n    for true_statements in combinations(range(1, n + 1), r):\n        if is_valid_combination(true_statements):\n            possible_solutions += 1\n\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code output indicates that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's analyze why this might be the case:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: Requires at least 2 statements to be true.\n2. **Statement 2**: Contradicts Statement 1 by requiring all statements to be true.\n3. **Statement 3**: Contradicts Statement 1 by allowing only 1 statement to be true.\n4. **Statement 4**: Is impossible because it requires all statements to be false.\n5. **Statement 5**: Requires either Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be true, but not both.\n6. **Statement 6**: Requires the number of true statements to be a prime number.\n7. **Statement 7**: Requires the number of false statements to be a composite number.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's re-evaluate the logic:\n\n- If Statement 3 is true, then only one statement can be true, which contradicts Statement 1.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then all statements are false, which is impossible.\n- Statement 5 requires one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be true, but not both.\n- Statement 6 and Statement 7 provide additional constraints on the number of true and false statements.\n\nThe code correctly evaluates that there are no possible solutions because the conditions are inherently contradictory. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
