    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - If this statement is true, then 6 or 7 statements are true.\n   - If this statement is false, then fewer than 6 statements are true.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - If this statement is true, then 0 or 1 statement is false.\n   - If this statement is false, then more than 1 statement is false.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - If this statement is true, then exactly 2 statements are true.\n   - If this statement is false, then not exactly 2 statements are true.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - If this statement is true, then exactly 3 statements are false.\n   - If this statement is false, then not exactly 3 statements are false.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This is a XOR condition between Statement 3 and Statement 4.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - The number of true statements must be a prime number (2, 3, 5, or 7).\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - The number of false statements must be a composite number (4, 6).\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If Statement 1 is true, then 6 or 7 statements are true.\n- If Statement 2 is true, then 0 or 1 statement is false.\n- If Statement 3 is true, then exactly 2 statements are true.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then exactly 3 statements are false.\n- If Statement 5 is true, then either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n- If Statement 6 is true, then the number of true statements is a prime number.\n- If Statement 7 is true, then the number of false statements is a composite number.\n\nLet's consider the possible number of true statements and check which satisfy all conditions:\n\n- **2 true statements**: \n  - Statement 3 would be true, making Statement 5 true.\n  - Statement 6 is true (2 is prime).\n  - Statement 7 is false (5 false statements, 5 is not composite).\n  - This scenario is not possible because Statement 7 must be true.\n\n- **3 true statements**:\n  - Statement 4 would be true, making Statement 5 true.\n  - Statement 6 is true (3 is prime).\n  - Statement 7 is true (4 false statements, 4 is composite).\n  - This scenario satisfies all conditions.\n\n- **5 true statements**:\n  - Statement 6 is true (5 is prime).\n  - Statement 7 is false (2 false statements, 2 is not composite).\n  - This scenario is not possible because Statement 7 must be true.\n\n- **6 true statements**:\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is true.\n  - Statement 6 is false (6 is not prime).\n  - Statement 7 is true (1 false statement, 1 is not composite).\n  - This scenario is not possible because Statement 6 must be true.\n\n- **7 true statements**:\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is true.\n  - Statement 6 is false (7 is prime).\n  - Statement 7 is false (0 false statements, 0 is not composite).\n  - This scenario is not possible because Statement 7 must be true.\n\nFrom the analysis, the only scenario that satisfies all conditions is when there are 3 true statements. Let's verify this with a Python script to ensure correctness.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\ndef check_statements():\n    possible_solutions = 0\n    for true_count in range(8):\n        false_count = 7 - true_count\n        s1 = true_count >= 6\n        s2 = false_count <= 1\n        s3 = true_count == 2\n        s4 = false_count == 3\n        s5 = (s3 or s4) and not (s3 and s4)\n        s6 = is_prime(true_count)\n        s7 = is_composite(false_count)\n        \n        if (s1 + s2 + s3 + s4 + s5 + s6 + s7) == true_count:\n            possible_solutions += 1\n    return possible_solutions\n\nprint(check_statements())\n```\n\nThe code will determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code output indicates that there are 2 possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements. This means there are two different configurations of truth values for the statements that meet all the conditions specified.\n\nGiven the analysis and the code execution, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
