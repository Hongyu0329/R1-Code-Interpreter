    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   - This implies all statements are true.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   - This implies at least 6 statements are true.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   - This implies 5 statements are false.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   - This implies 3 statements are true.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'  \n   - This implies one of the conditions in Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'  \n   - Possible prime numbers for true statements are 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'  \n   - Possible composite numbers for false statements are 4, 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the consistency of these statements:\n\n- If Statement 1 is true, then all statements are true, which contradicts Statements 3, 4, and 5.\n- If Statement 2 is true, then at most 1 statement is false, which means at least 6 statements are true.\n- If Statement 3 is true, then exactly 2 statements are true, which contradicts Statement 1 and 2.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then exactly 4 statements are false, which means 3 statements are true.\n- Statement 5 implies either Statement 3 or 4 is true, but not both.\n- Statement 6 requires the number of true statements to be a prime number.\n- Statement 7 requires the number of false statements to be a composite number.\n\nLet's evaluate the possible scenarios:\n\n1. **Scenario 1**: Assume 6 statements are true (Statement 2 is true).\n   - True statements: 6 (prime)\n   - False statements: 1 (not composite)\n   - This scenario is not possible due to Statement 7.\n\n2. **Scenario 2**: Assume 3 statements are true (Statement 4 is true).\n   - True statements: 3 (prime)\n   - False statements: 4 (composite)\n   - This scenario satisfies all conditions.\n\n3. **Scenario 3**: Assume 2 statements are true (Statement 3 is true).\n   - True statements: 2 (prime)\n   - False statements: 5 (not composite)\n   - This scenario is not possible due to Statement 7.\n\n4. **Scenario 4**: Assume 7 statements are true (Statement 1 is true).\n   - True statements: 7 (prime)\n   - False statements: 0 (not composite)\n   - This scenario is not possible due to Statement 7.\n\nFrom the analysis, only Scenario 2 is consistent with all the statements. Therefore, there is only one possible solution.\n\nLet's confirm this with a Python script to ensure the logic is correct:\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\npossible_solutions = 0\n\n# Check each scenario\nfor true_count in range(8):\n    false_count = 7 - true_count\n    if (true_count >= 6 or true_count == 3) and is_prime(true_count) and is_composite(false_count):\n        possible_solutions += 1\n\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm the number of possible solutions.",
    "The code execution confirms that there is only one possible solution that satisfies all the given statements. \n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
