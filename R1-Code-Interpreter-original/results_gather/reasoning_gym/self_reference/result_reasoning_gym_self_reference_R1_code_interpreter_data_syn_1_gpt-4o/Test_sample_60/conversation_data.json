    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means the number of true statements (T) is 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 0 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This implies that all statements are true, i.e., T = 7.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means T = 4.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means T = 4 (since 7 - 3 = 4).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This means either T = 4 (Statement 3 is true) or T = 4 (Statement 4 is true), but not both. However, since both statements imply T = 4, this statement is inherently contradictory if both are true.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - Prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. So, T could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - Composite numbers less than 7 are 4 and 6. So, the number of false statements (F) could be 4 or 6, which means T could be 3 or 1.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values of T:\n\n- From Statement 2, T = 7.\n- From Statement 6, T could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n- From Statement 7, T could be 3 or 1.\n\nCombining these, the only consistent value for T is 7, as it satisfies all the conditions where possible.\n\nLet's verify this by checking each statement:\n- Statement 1: True, since 7 >= 4.\n- Statement 2: True, since 0 false statements.\n- Statement 3: False, since T is not 4.\n- Statement 4: False, since T is not 4.\n- Statement 5: True, since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true.\n- Statement 6: True, since 7 is a prime number.\n- Statement 7: False, since 0 false statements is not a composite number.\n\nThus, the only consistent solution is when T = 7, and there is only one such solution.\n\nLet's confirm this with a Python script to ensure all conditions are checked:\n\n```python\ndef check_statements():\n    possible_solutions = 0\n    for T in range(8):  # T can be from 0 to 7\n        F = 7 - T\n        s1 = (T >= 4)\n        s2 = (F <= 0)\n        s3 = (T == 4)\n        s4 = (F == 3)\n        s5 = (s3 != s4)\n        s6 = (T in [2, 3, 5, 7])\n        s7 = (F in [4, 6])\n        \n        if all([s1, s2, s5, s6]) and not s7:\n            possible_solutions += 1\n    \n    print(possible_solutions)\n\ncheck_statements()\n```\n\nThe code will be executed to confirm the number of possible solutions.",
    "It seems there was an error in the logic of the code. Let's re-evaluate the conditions and correct the code.\n\nThe key points to consider are:\n- Statement 2 implies T = 7.\n- Statement 6 implies T is a prime number, which includes 7.\n- Statement 7 implies F is a composite number, which is not possible if T = 7.\n\nGiven these, the only consistent solution is when T = 7, but we need to ensure the logic in the code reflects this correctly.\n\nLet's correct the code:\n\n```python\ndef check_statements():\n    possible_solutions = 0\n    for T in range(8):  # T can be from 0 to 7\n        F = 7 - T\n        s1 = (T >= 4)\n        s2 = (F <= 0)\n        s3 = (T == 4)\n        s4 = (F == 3)\n        s5 = (s3 != s4)\n        s6 = (T in [2, 3, 5, 7])\n        s7 = (F in [4, 6])\n        \n        # Check if the combination of statements is valid\n        if s1 and s2 and s5 and s6 and not s7:\n            possible_solutions += 1\n    \n    print(possible_solutions)\n\ncheck_statements()\n```\n\nLet's execute this corrected code to determine the number of possible solutions.",
