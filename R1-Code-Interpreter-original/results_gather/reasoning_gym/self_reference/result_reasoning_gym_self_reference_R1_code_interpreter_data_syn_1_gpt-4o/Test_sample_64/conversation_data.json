    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine how many of them can be true simultaneously. Let's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   - This implies all statements are true.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   - This implies at least 6 statements are true.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   - This implies exactly 3 statements are true.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   - This implies all statements are true.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'  \n   - This implies one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'  \n   - This implies the number of true statements is 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'  \n   - This implies the number of false statements is 4 or 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If Statement 1 is true, then all statements are true. This contradicts Statement 3 and Statement 7.\n- If Statement 2 is true, then at least 6 statements are true. This contradicts Statement 3.\n- If Statement 3 is true, then exactly 3 statements are true. This contradicts Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 4.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then all statements are true. This contradicts Statement 3 and Statement 7.\n- If Statement 5 is true, then either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n- If Statement 6 is true, the number of true statements is a prime number (2, 3, 5, or 7).\n- If Statement 7 is true, the number of false statements is a composite number (4 or 6).\n\nLet's use Python to check the possible combinations of true and false statements that satisfy these conditions.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Total number of statements\nn = 7\n\n# Prime numbers less than or equal to 7\nprime_numbers = {2, 3, 5, 7}\n\n# Composite numbers less than or equal to 7\ncomposite_numbers = {4, 6}\n\n# Function to check if a combination of true statements is valid\ndef is_valid_combination(true_statements):\n    num_true = len(true_statements)\n    num_false = n - num_true\n    \n    # Check each statement\n    if 1 in true_statements and num_true < 7:\n        return False\n    if 2 in true_statements and num_true < 6:\n        return False\n    if 3 in true_statements and num_true != 3:\n        return False\n    if 4 in true_statements and num_true != 7:\n        return False\n    if 5 in true_statements and not (3 in true_statements) ^ (4 in true_statements):\n        return False\n    if 6 in true_statements and num_true not in prime_numbers:\n        return False\n    if 7 in true_statements and num_false not in composite_numbers:\n        return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# Count valid combinations\nvalid_combinations = 0\n\n# Check all combinations of true statements\nfor r in range(1, n + 1):\n    for true_statements in combinations(range(1, n + 1), r):\n        if is_valid_combination(true_statements):\n            valid_combinations += 1\n\nprint(valid_combinations)\n```\n\nThe code will check all possible combinations of true statements and count how many satisfy all the conditions. Let's execute the code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "The code execution indicates that there are 4 valid combinations of true statements that satisfy all the given conditions. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<4>>>"
