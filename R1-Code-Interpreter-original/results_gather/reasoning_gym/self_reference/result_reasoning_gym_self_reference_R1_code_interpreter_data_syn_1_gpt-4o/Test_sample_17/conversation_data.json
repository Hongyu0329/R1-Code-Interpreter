    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   This means the number of true statements \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   This means the number of false statements \\( F \\leq 3 \\). Since there are 7 statements in total, \\( T = 7 - F \\), so \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   This is a contradiction if any statement is true, so this statement must be false.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   This means \\( F = 2 \\), so \\( T = 5 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'  \n   Since Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 must be true.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'  \n   If Statement 4 is true, then \\( T = 5 \\), which is a prime number.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'  \n   If \\( F = 2 \\), this statement is false because 2 is not a composite number.\n\nNow, let's verify the consistency of these statements:\n\n- If Statement 4 is true, then \\( T = 5 \\) and \\( F = 2 \\).\n- Statement 1 is satisfied because \\( T = 5 \\geq 4 \\).\n- Statement 2 is satisfied because \\( F = 2 \\leq 3 \\).\n- Statement 6 is satisfied because 5 is a prime number.\n- Statement 7 is false because 2 is not a composite number.\n\nThus, the only consistent solution is when \\( T = 5 \\) and \\( F = 2 \\). Let's confirm this by checking the truth values of each statement:\n\n- Statement 1: True\n- Statement 2: True\n- Statement 3: False\n- Statement 4: True\n- Statement 5: True (since Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false)\n- Statement 6: True\n- Statement 7: False\n\nThe number of true statements is 5, which is consistent with our solution. Therefore, there is only one possible solution.\n\n<<<1>>>"
