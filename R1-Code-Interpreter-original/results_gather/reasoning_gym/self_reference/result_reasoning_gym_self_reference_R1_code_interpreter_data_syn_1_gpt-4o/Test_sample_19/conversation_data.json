    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine how many consistent solutions exist. Let's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   - This implies all statements are true.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   - This implies at least 6 statements are true.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   - This implies 1 statement is true and 6 are false.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   - This is a contradiction because if this statement is true, then it itself cannot be false.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'  \n   - This implies one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'  \n   - Possible prime numbers for true statements are 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'  \n   - Possible composite numbers for false statements are 4, 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the consistency of these statements:\n\n- If Statement 1 is true, then all statements are true, which contradicts Statement 3 and Statement 4.\n- If Statement 2 is true, then at least 6 statements are true, which contradicts Statement 3 and Statement 4.\n- If Statement 3 is true, then only one statement is true, which contradicts Statement 1 and Statement 2.\n- Statement 4 cannot be true as it is self-contradictory.\n- Statement 5 can be true if either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n- Statement 6 can be true if the number of true statements is 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n- Statement 7 can be true if the number of false statements is 4 or 6.\n\nLet's write a Python script to check all possible combinations of true and false statements to find consistent solutions.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\n# Generate all combinations of truth values for 7 statements\ncombinations = list(product([True, False], repeat=7))\nvalid_solutions = 0\n\nfor combo in combinations:\n    s1, s2, s3, s4, s5, s6, s7 = combo\n    \n    # Check each statement's condition\n    if (s1 == (sum(combo) >= 7) and\n        s2 == (sum(combo) >= 6) and\n        s3 == (sum(combo) == 1) and\n        s4 == (sum(combo) == 0) and\n        s5 == (s3 != s4) and\n        s6 == is_prime(sum(combo)) and\n        s7 == is_composite(7 - sum(combo))):\n        valid_solutions += 1\n\nprint(valid_solutions)\n```\n\nThis code will check all possible combinations of truth values for the 7 statements and count how many combinations satisfy all the conditions. Let's execute the code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "The code output indicates that there are no valid combinations of truth values for the statements that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's analyze why this might be the case:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: If true, all statements must be true, which contradicts Statements 3 and 4.\n2. **Statement 2**: If true, at least 6 statements must be true, which contradicts Statements 3 and 4.\n3. **Statement 3**: If true, only one statement is true, which contradicts Statements 1 and 2.\n4. **Statement 4**: Cannot be true as it is self-contradictory.\n5. **Statement 5**: Can be true if either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n6. **Statement 6**: Can be true if the number of true statements is 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n7. **Statement 7**: Can be true if the number of false statements is 4 or 6.\n\nGiven these conditions, it seems that the constraints are too strict to allow for any consistent solution. The logical contradictions between the statements, especially involving Statements 3 and 4, make it impossible to satisfy all conditions simultaneously.\n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
