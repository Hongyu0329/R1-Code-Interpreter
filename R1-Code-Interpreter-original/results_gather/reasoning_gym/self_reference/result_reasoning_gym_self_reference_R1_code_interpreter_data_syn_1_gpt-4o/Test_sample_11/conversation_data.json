    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine how many of them can be true simultaneously. Let's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means that the number of true statements (T) is 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means that the number of false statements (F) is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means T = 7, which implies all statements are true.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements is false.'\n   - This means F = 1, which implies 6 statements are true.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This means either T = 7 or F = 1, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - This means T is a prime number (2, 3, 5, or 7).\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - This means F is a composite number (4, 6).\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If T = 7 (all statements are true), then F = 0. This contradicts Statement 7, which requires F to be composite. Also, Statement 5 would be false because both Statements 3 and 4 cannot be true simultaneously.\n\n- If T = 6, then F = 1. This satisfies Statement 4, but not Statement 5, because Statement 3 would be false. Also, F = 1 is not composite, contradicting Statement 7.\n\n- If T = 5, then F = 2. This satisfies Statement 6 (since 5 is prime) and Statement 7 (since 2 is not composite). However, it contradicts Statement 4, which requires F = 1.\n\n- If T = 4, then F = 3. This satisfies Statement 1, but not Statement 6 (since 4 is not prime) and Statement 7 (since 3 is not composite).\n\n- If T = 3, then F = 4. This satisfies Statement 7 (since 4 is composite), but not Statement 6 (since 3 is prime).\n\n- If T = 2, then F = 5. This satisfies Statement 2, but not Statement 6 (since 2 is prime) and Statement 7 (since 5 is not composite).\n\n- If T = 1, then F = 6. This satisfies Statement 7 (since 6 is composite), but not Statement 6 (since 1 is not prime).\n\nLet's write a Python script to check these conditions and find the number of possible solutions.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\npossible_solutions = 0\n\nfor T in range(8):\n    F = 7 - T\n    if (T >= 4 and F <= 5 and\n        ((T == 7) != (F == 1)) and\n        is_prime(T) and\n        is_composite(F)):\n        possible_solutions += 1\n\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "The code output indicates that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's review the logic to ensure that all constraints are correctly implemented:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: T must be at least 4.\n2. **Statement 2**: F must be at most 5.\n3. **Statement 5**: Either T = 7 or F = 1, but not both.\n4. **Statement 6**: T must be a prime number.\n5. **Statement 7**: F must be a composite number.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's re-evaluate the possible values for T and F:\n\n- **T = 7**: F = 0, which is not composite.\n- **T = 6**: F = 1, which is not composite.\n- **T = 5**: F = 2, which is not composite.\n- **T = 4**: F = 3, which is not composite.\n- **T = 3**: F = 4, which is composite, but T is not at least 4.\n- **T = 2**: F = 5, which is not composite.\n- **T = 1**: F = 6, which is composite, but T is not at least 4.\n\nThe constraints are too strict, and no combination satisfies all conditions simultaneously. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is indeed zero.\n\n<<<0>>>"
