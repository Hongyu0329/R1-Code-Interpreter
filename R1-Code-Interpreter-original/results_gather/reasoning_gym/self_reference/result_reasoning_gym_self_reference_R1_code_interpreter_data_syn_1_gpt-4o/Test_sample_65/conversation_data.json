    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine how many of them can be true simultaneously. Let's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 5 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means that 5, 6, or all 7 statements are true.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 0 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This implies that all statements are true.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means that precisely 5 statements are true.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means that precisely 5 statements are false.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This is a XOR condition between Statement 3 and Statement 4.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (out of 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (out of 7) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If Statement 2 is true, then all statements are true, which contradicts Statement 4 and Statement 5. Therefore, Statement 2 cannot be true.\n- If Statement 3 is true, then exactly 5 statements are true, which means 2 statements are false. This contradicts Statement 7, which requires a composite number of false statements.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then exactly 5 statements are false, which means 2 statements are true. This contradicts Statement 6, which requires a prime number of true statements.\n- If Statement 5 is true, then either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This means we need to check the scenarios where either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true.\n- If Statement 6 is true, the number of true statements must be a prime number (2, 3, 5, or 7).\n- If Statement 7 is true, the number of false statements must be a composite number (4 or 6).\n\nLet's write a Python script to check all possible combinations of true and false statements and count the number of valid solutions.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Total number of statements\nn_statements = 7\n\n# Possible prime numbers for true statements\nprime_true_counts = {2, 3, 5, 7}\n\n# Possible composite numbers for false statements\ncomposite_false_counts = {4, 6}\n\n# Function to check if a combination of true statements is valid\ndef is_valid_combination(true_statements):\n    n_true = len(true_statements)\n    n_false = n_statements - n_true\n    \n    # Check each statement\n    s1 = n_true >= 5\n    s2 = n_false == 0\n    s3 = n_true == 5\n    s4 = n_false == 5\n    s5 = (s3 or s4) and not (s3 and s4)\n    s6 = n_true in prime_true_counts\n    s7 = n_false in composite_false_counts\n    \n    # Create a list of truth values for each statement\n    truth_values = [s1, s2, s3, s4, s5, s6, s7]\n    \n    # Check if the combination satisfies the truth values\n    return all(truth_values[i] for i in true_statements)\n\n# Count the number of valid solutions\nvalid_solutions = 0\n\n# Check all combinations of true statements\nfor r in range(1, n_statements + 1):\n    for true_statements in combinations(range(n_statements), r):\n        if is_valid_combination(true_statements):\n            valid_solutions += 1\n\nprint(valid_solutions)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "The code execution indicates that there are 4 possible solutions. This means there are 4 different combinations of truth values for the statements that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\n<<<4>>>"
