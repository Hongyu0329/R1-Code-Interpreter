    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means the number of true statements (T) is 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means the number of false statements (F) is 0, 1, 2, or 3.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means T = 4.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means F = 3.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This means either T = 4 or F = 3, but not both simultaneously.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - Possible prime numbers for T are 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - Possible composite numbers for F are 4, 6, or 8.\n\nNow, let's analyze the constraints:\n\n- From Statements 1 and 2, we know T + F = 7.\n- From Statement 5, if Statement 3 is true (T = 4), then Statement 4 must be false (F ≠ 3), and vice versa.\n- From Statement 6, T must be a prime number.\n- From Statement 7, F must be a composite number.\n\nLet's write a Python script to find the number of possible solutions that satisfy all these conditions.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\npossible_solutions = 0\n\nfor T in range(8):  # T can be from 0 to 7\n    F = 7 - T\n    if (T >= 4 and F <= 3) and (T == 4 or F == 3) and (T != 4 or F != 3) and is_prime(T) and is_composite(F):\n        possible_solutions += 1\n\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "The code output indicates that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's re-evaluate the constraints to ensure that the logic is correct:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: T ≥ 4\n2. **Statement 2**: F ≤ 3\n3. **Statement 3**: T = 4\n4. **Statement 4**: F = 3\n5. **Statement 5**: Either T = 4 or F = 3, but not both.\n6. **Statement 6**: T is a prime number (2, 3, 5, 7).\n7. **Statement 7**: F is a composite number (4, 6, 8).\n\nGiven these constraints, let's re-evaluate the possible values for T and F:\n\n- If T = 4, then F = 3. However, this violates Statement 5 because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 would be true.\n- If T = 5, then F = 2. This satisfies Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 5, and Statement 6, but F = 2 is not a composite number, violating Statement 7.\n- If T = 6, then F = 1. This satisfies Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 6, but F = 1 is not a composite number, violating Statement 7.\n- If T = 7, then F = 0. This satisfies Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 6, but F = 0 is not a composite number, violating Statement 7.\n\nIt seems that the constraints are too strict, and no combination of T and F satisfies all the conditions simultaneously. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is indeed 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
