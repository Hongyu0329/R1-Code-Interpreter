    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine how many of them can be true simultaneously. Let's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   - If this statement is true, then all 7 statements must be true. However, this creates a contradiction because Statement 4 claims all statements are false. Therefore, Statement 1 cannot be true.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   - This means that at least 2 statements are true. If this statement is false, then more than 5 statements are false, which means at least 6 statements are false.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   - If this statement is true, then exactly 3 statements are true.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   - This is a contradiction because if all statements are false, then Statement 4 itself cannot be true.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'  \n   - This is a logical XOR condition. If Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 must be false, and vice versa.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'  \n   - Possible prime numbers for the number of true statements are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'  \n   - Possible composite numbers for the number of false statements are 4, 6, etc.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the possible scenarios:\n\n- If Statement 3 is true, then exactly 3 statements are true. This satisfies Statement 6 (since 3 is a prime number) and makes Statement 7 true (since 4 false statements is a composite number). Statement 5 is also satisfied because Statement 4 is false.\n\n- If Statement 4 is true, then all statements are false, which is a contradiction.\n\nLet's write a Python script to verify these conditions and count the number of possible solutions.\n\n```python\ndef check_statements():\n    possible_solutions = 0\n    for true_count in range(8):\n        false_count = 7 - true_count\n        # Check each statement\n        s1 = (true_count >= 7)\n        s2 = (false_count <= 5)\n        s3 = (true_count == 3)\n        s4 = (false_count == 7)\n        s5 = (s3 != s4)\n        s6 = (true_count in [2, 3, 5, 7])\n        s7 = (false_count in [4, 6])\n        \n        # Count the number of true statements\n        true_statements = sum([s1, s2, s3, s4, s5, s6, s7])\n        \n        # Check if the number of true statements matches the true_count\n        if true_statements == true_count:\n            possible_solutions += 1\n    \n    print(possible_solutions)\n\ncheck_statements()\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "The code execution indicates that there are 2 possible solutions where the conditions of the statements are satisfied. This means there are two different configurations of truth values for the statements that meet all the given conditions.\n\n<<<2>>>"
