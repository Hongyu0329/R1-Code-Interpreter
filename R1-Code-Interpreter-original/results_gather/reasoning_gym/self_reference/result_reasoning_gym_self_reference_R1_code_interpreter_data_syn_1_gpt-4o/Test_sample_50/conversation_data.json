    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   - This implies all statements are true.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   - This implies that 0, 1, or 2 statements are false.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   - This implies all statements are true.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   - This implies 5 statements are false, and 2 are true.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'  \n   - This implies that either all statements are true, or exactly 5 are false, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'  \n   - Possible prime numbers for true statements are 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'  \n   - Possible composite numbers for false statements are 4 or 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the consistency of these statements:\n\n- If Statement 1 is true, then all statements are true. This would make Statement 4 false, contradicting Statement 5.\n- If Statement 3 is true, then all statements are true, which contradicts Statement 4 and Statement 5.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then 5 statements are false, which contradicts Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 3.\n- If Statement 5 is true, then either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n- If Statement 6 is true, the number of true statements must be a prime number.\n- If Statement 7 is true, the number of false statements must be a composite number.\n\nLet's use Python to check the possible combinations of true and false statements that satisfy all these conditions.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import isprime\n\n# Possible number of true statements\npossible_true_counts = [2, 3, 5, 7]  # Prime numbers\n\n# Possible number of false statements\npossible_false_counts = [4, 6]  # Composite numbers\n\n# Total number of statements\ntotal_statements = 7\n\n# Check each combination of true and false counts\npossible_solutions = 0\nfor true_count in possible_true_counts:\n    false_count = total_statements - true_count\n    if false_count in possible_false_counts:\n        # Check the conditions\n        if (true_count == 7 and false_count == 0) or (true_count == 2 and false_count == 5):\n            # Statement 5 condition\n            if (true_count == 7 and false_count == 0) or (true_count == 2 and false_count == 5):\n                possible_solutions += 1\n\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "The code output indicates that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's re-evaluate the logic to ensure that all conditions are correctly considered.\n\n1. **Statement 1**: If true, all statements are true, which contradicts Statement 4.\n2. **Statement 2**: Allows for 0, 1, or 2 false statements.\n3. **Statement 3**: If true, all statements are true, which contradicts Statement 4.\n4. **Statement 4**: If true, 5 statements are false, which contradicts Statement 1 and Statement 3.\n5. **Statement 5**: Only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true.\n6. **Statement 6**: True count must be a prime number.\n7. **Statement 7**: False count must be a composite number.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's re-evaluate the possible scenarios:\n\n- If 7 statements are true, then 0 are false, which contradicts Statement 7.\n- If 2 statements are true, then 5 are false, which satisfies Statement 4 and Statement 5, but contradicts Statement 1 and Statement 2.\n- If 3 statements are true, then 4 are false, which satisfies Statement 7 but contradicts Statement 4.\n- If 5 statements are true, then 2 are false, which satisfies Statement 2 and Statement 6, but contradicts Statement 4.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the logic to ensure all conditions are correctly considered. It seems there might be a logical inconsistency in the problem itself, leading to no valid solutions. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
