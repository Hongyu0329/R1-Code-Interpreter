    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - If this statement is true, then there are either 6 or 7 true statements.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - If this statement is true, then there are at most 5 false statements, meaning there are at least 2 true statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - If this statement is true, then there are exactly 2 true statements.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - If this statement is true, then there are exactly 2 false statements, meaning there are 5 true statements.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This is a classic XOR condition, meaning one of the statements is true, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (between 0 and 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (between 0 and 7) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If Statement 1 is true, then there are 6 or 7 true statements.\n- If Statement 2 is true, then there are at least 2 true statements.\n- If Statement 3 is true, then there are exactly 2 true statements.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then there are exactly 2 false statements (5 true statements).\n- If Statement 5 is true, then either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n- If Statement 6 is true, then the number of true statements is a prime number (2, 3, 5, or 7).\n- If Statement 7 is true, then the number of false statements is a composite number (4 or 6).\n\nLet's write a Python script to check all possible combinations of true and false statements and count the number of valid solutions.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\n# Define the statements\nstatements = [\n    lambda t: t >= 6,  # Statement 1\n    lambda f: f <= 5,  # Statement 2\n    lambda t: t == 2,  # Statement 3\n    lambda f: f == 2,  # Statement 4\n    lambda t, f: (t == 2) != (f == 2),  # Statement 5\n    lambda t: t in {2, 3, 5, 7},  # Statement 6\n    lambda f: f in {4, 6}  # Statement 7\n]\n\n# Count the number of valid solutions\nvalid_solutions = 0\n\n# Iterate over all possible combinations of true (1) and false (0) for 7 statements\nfor combination in product([0, 1], repeat=7):\n    true_count = sum(combination)\n    false_count = 7 - true_count\n    \n    # Check if all statements are satisfied\n    if all(statements[i](true_count, false_count) if i in {4} else statements[i](true_count) for i in range(7)):\n        valid_solutions += 1\n\nprint(valid_solutions)\n```\n\nThis code will iterate over all possible combinations of true and false statements, check if they satisfy all the conditions, and count the number of valid solutions. Let's execute the code to find the answer.",
    "The code output indicates that there are no valid solutions based on the conditions provided. Let's re-evaluate the logic to ensure that all conditions are correctly implemented and check if there might be any logical errors in the reasoning or code.\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This implies that if true, there are 6 or 7 true statements.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This implies that if true, there are at least 2 true statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This implies that if true, there are exactly 2 true statements.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This implies that if true, there are exactly 2 false statements, meaning 5 true statements.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This implies that one of the statements is true, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements are 4 and 6.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the logic and ensure that the conditions are correctly implemented in the code.

    "The output of 0 suggests that there are no combinations of true and false statements that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's carefully re-evaluate the logic and constraints to ensure that they are correctly implemented.\n\n### Re-evaluation of Statements:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - If true, then 6 or 7 statements are true.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - If true, then at least 2 statements are true.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - If true, then exactly 2 statements are true.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - If true, then exactly 2 statements are false (5 true).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This is an XOR condition between Statement 3 and Statement 4.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - Possible prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - Possible composite numbers: 4, 6.\n\n### Logical Analysis:\n\n- If Statement 1 is true, then Statements 3 and 4 cannot be true.\n- If Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 cannot be true, and vice versa.\n- Statement 5 enforces that only one of Statement 3 or 4 can be true.\n- Statement 6 requires the number of true statements to be prime.\n- Statement 7 requires the number of false statements to be composite.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's manually check the possible scenarios:\n\n- **6 True Statements**: \n  - False statements = 1 (not composite, so invalid)\n  \n- **5 True Statements**:\n  - False statements = 2 (not composite, so invalid)\n  \n- **3 True Statements**:\n  - False statements = 4 (composite, valid)\n  - Check: \n    - Statement 1: False\n    - Statement 2: True\n    - Statement 3: False\n    - Statement 4: False\n    - Statement 5: True (since both 3 and 4 are false, this is invalid)\n    - Statement 6: True\n    - Statement 7: True\n\n- **2 True Statements**:\n  - False statements = 5 (not composite, so invalid)\n\nIt seems there might be a logical contradiction in the problem as stated, or the constraints are too strict to allow any valid solution. Given the constraints, it appears there are no valid solutions.\n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
