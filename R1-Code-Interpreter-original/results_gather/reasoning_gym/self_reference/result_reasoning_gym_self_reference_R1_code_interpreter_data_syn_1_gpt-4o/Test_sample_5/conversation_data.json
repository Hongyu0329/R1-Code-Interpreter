    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 1 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   - This means that not all statements can be false.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 7 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   - This is trivially true because there are only 7 statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   - This means that 3 statements are false.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   - This means that 4 statements are true.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'  \n   - This means that either exactly 4 statements are true or exactly 3 statements are false, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'  \n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (out of 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'  \n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (out of 7) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If Statement 3 is true, then there are exactly 4 true statements.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then there are exactly 3 false statements.\n\nGiven Statement 5, only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true.\n\nLet's consider the possible number of true statements:\n\n- **2 true statements**: Not possible because Statement 6 requires a prime number of true statements, and 2 is prime, but it doesn't satisfy Statement 5.\n- **3 true statements**: This satisfies Statement 6 (3 is prime) and Statement 4, but not Statement 5.\n- **4 true statements**: This satisfies Statement 3 and Statement 5, but not Statement 6 (4 is not prime).\n- **5 true statements**: This satisfies Statement 6 (5 is prime) but not Statement 5.\n- **6 true statements**: Not possible because it would make Statement 7 false (1 false statement is not composite).\n- **7 true statements**: Not possible because it would make Statement 7 false (0 false statements is not composite).\n\nLet's write a Python script to check the possible solutions:\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\npossible_solutions = 0\n\nfor true_statements in range(8):\n    false_statements = 7 - true_statements\n    \n    statement_1 = true_statements >= 1\n    statement_2 = false_statements <= 7\n    statement_3 = true_statements == 4\n    statement_4 = false_statements == 3\n    statement_5 = (statement_3 or statement_4) and not (statement_3 and statement_4)\n    statement_6 = is_prime(true_statements)\n    statement_7 = is_composite(false_statements)\n    \n    if all([statement_1, statement_2, statement_5, statement_6, statement_7]):\n        possible_solutions += 1\n\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "The code output indicates that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's review the logic to ensure everything is correct:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: At least 1 statement must be true.\n2. **Statement 2**: This is always true since there are 7 statements.\n3. **Statement 3**: Exactly 4 statements are true.\n4. **Statement 4**: Exactly 3 statements are false.\n5. **Statement 5**: Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n6. **Statement 6**: The number of true statements is a prime number.\n7. **Statement 7**: The number of false statements is a composite number.\n\nGiven the constraints, let's analyze:\n\n- If 4 statements are true (Statement 3), then 3 are false, which satisfies Statement 4. But Statement 5 requires only one of Statement 3 or 4 to be true, not both.\n- If 3 statements are true, then 4 are false, which satisfies Statement 7 (4 is composite), but not Statement 6 (3 is prime, but Statement 5 is violated).\n\nThe code correctly checks all combinations, and the logic shows that no configuration satisfies all conditions simultaneously. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is indeed zero.\n\n<<<0>>>"
