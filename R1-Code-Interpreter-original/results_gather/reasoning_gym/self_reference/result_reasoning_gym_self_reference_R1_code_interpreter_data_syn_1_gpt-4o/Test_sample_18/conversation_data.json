    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means the number of true statements (T) is 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means the number of false statements (F) is 0 or 1, which implies T is 6 or 7.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means T is 4.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means F is 3, which implies T is 4.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This means either T is 4 (Statement 3 is true) or F is 3 (Statement 4 is true), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - This means T is a prime number: 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - This means F is a composite number: 4, 6, 8, etc.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values for T and F:\n\n- If T = 4, then F = 3. This satisfies Statements 3, 4, and 5, but not Statement 6 (since 4 is not prime) or Statement 7 (since 3 is not composite).\n- If T = 5, then F = 2. This satisfies Statement 6 (since 5 is prime) but not Statement 7 (since 2 is not composite).\n- If T = 6, then F = 1. This satisfies Statement 6 (since 6 is not prime) and Statement 7 (since 1 is not composite).\n- If T = 7, then F = 0. This satisfies Statement 6 (since 7 is prime) but not Statement 7 (since 0 is not composite).\n\nLet's write a Python script to check which combinations of T and F satisfy all the conditions.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\npossible_solutions = 0\n\nfor T in range(8):\n    F = 7 - T\n    if (T >= 4 and F <= 1 and\n        ((T == 4 and F == 3) or (T != 4 and F != 3)) and\n        is_prime(T) and is_composite(F)):\n        possible_solutions += 1\n\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "The code output indicates that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's review the logic to ensure it aligns with the problem's requirements:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: T must be at least 4.\n2. **Statement 2**: F must be at most 1.\n3. **Statement 3** and **Statement 4**: Either T is 4 or F is 3, but not both.\n4. **Statement 6**: T must be a prime number.\n5. **Statement 7**: F must be a composite number.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's re-evaluate the possible values for T and F:\n\n- If T = 4, F = 3: This satisfies Statements 3 and 4, but not Statement 6 (4 is not prime) or Statement 7 (3 is not composite).\n- If T = 5, F = 2: This satisfies Statement 6 (5 is prime) but not Statement 7 (2 is not composite).\n- If T = 6, F = 1: This satisfies Statement 2, but not Statement 6 (6 is not prime) or Statement 7 (1 is not composite).\n- If T = 7, F = 0: This satisfies Statement 6 (7 is prime) but not Statement 7 (0 is not composite).\n\nThe code correctly checks these conditions, and the result of 0 indicates that no combination of T and F satisfies all the conditions simultaneously.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
