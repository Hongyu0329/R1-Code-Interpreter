    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means the number of true statements (T) is 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means the number of false statements (F) is 0, 1, 2, or 3.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means T = 3.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means F = 2.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This means either T = 3 or F = 2, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - This means T is a prime number (2, 3, 5, or 7).\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - This means F is a composite number (4, 6, 8, etc.).\n\nNow, let's analyze the constraints:\n\n- From Statements 1 and 2, we know T + F = 7.\n- From Statement 5, we have two cases: T = 3 or F = 2.\n- From Statement 6, T must be a prime number.\n- From Statement 7, F must be a composite number.\n\nLet's evaluate these conditions using Python code to find the number of possible solutions.\n\n```python\n# Possible values for T (true statements) and F (false statements)\npossible_T = [2, 3, 5, 7]  # Prime numbers\npossible_F = [4, 6]        # Composite numbers\n\n# Count the number of valid solutions\nvalid_solutions = 0\n\n# Check each combination of T and F\nfor T in possible_T:\n    F = 7 - T\n    if F in possible_F:\n        # Check the conditions for Statement 5\n        if (T == 3 and F != 2) or (F == 2 and T != 3):\n            valid_solutions += 1\n\nprint(valid_solutions)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "The code execution indicates that there is only one possible solution that satisfies all the given conditions. \n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<1>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
