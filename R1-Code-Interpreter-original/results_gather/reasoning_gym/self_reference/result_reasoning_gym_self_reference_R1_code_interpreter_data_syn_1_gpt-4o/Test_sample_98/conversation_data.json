    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine how many of them can be true simultaneously. Let's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   - If this statement is true, then all 7 statements must be true. However, this creates a contradiction because if all statements are true, then Statement 4 ('Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false') cannot be true. Therefore, Statement 1 must be false.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   - If this statement is true, then there can be 0, 1, or 2 false statements. This is possible, so we will consider this statement as potentially true.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   - If this statement is true, then there are exactly 5 true statements and 2 false statements. This is consistent with Statement 2 being true.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   - If this statement is true, then there are exactly 2 false statements and 5 true statements. This is consistent with Statement 3 being true.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'  \n   - This statement implies that either Statement 3 is true or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This means that if Statement 5 is true, then one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 must be false.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'  \n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (out of 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'  \n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (out of 7) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If there are 5 true statements, then there are 2 false statements. This satisfies Statement 3 and Statement 4, but contradicts Statement 5. Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\n- If there are 3 true statements, then there are 4 false statements. This satisfies Statement 6 (3 is prime) and Statement 7 (4 is composite). However, it contradicts Statement 2 ('At most 2 of these 7 statements are false').\n\n- If there are 2 true statements, then there are 5 false statements. This satisfies Statement 6 (2 is prime) but contradicts Statement 7 (5 is not composite).\n\n- If there are 4 true statements, then there are 3 false statements. This does not satisfy Statement 6 (4 is not prime) or Statement 7 (3 is not composite).\n\n- If there are 6 true statements, then there is 1 false statement. This satisfies Statement 2, but contradicts Statement 6 (6 is not prime) and Statement 7 (1 is not composite).\n\n- If there are 7 true statements, then there are 0 false statements. This contradicts Statement 1.\n\nGiven these analyses, let's write a Python script to check the possible number of solutions:\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\npossible_solutions = 0\n\nfor true_count in range(8):\n    false_count = 7 - true_count\n    \n    # Check each statement\n    s1 = (true_count >= 7)\n    s2 = (false_count <= 2)\n    s3 = (true_count == 5)\n    s4 = (false_count == 2)\n    s5 = (s3 != s4)\n    s6 = is_prime(true_count)\n    s7 = is_composite(false_count)\n    \n    # Count valid solutions\n    if (s1 + s2 + s3 + s4 + s5 + s6 + s7) == true_count:\n        possible_solutions += 1\n\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "The code execution indicates that there are 2 possible solutions where the statements align with the given conditions. \n\nLet's summarize the findings:\n\n- The possible scenarios where the number of true and false statements satisfy all the conditions are limited.\n- The code checks each possible number of true statements (from 0 to 7) and evaluates whether the conditions of each statement are met.\n- The result shows that there are 2 configurations where the statements can be true without contradictions.\n\nThus, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
