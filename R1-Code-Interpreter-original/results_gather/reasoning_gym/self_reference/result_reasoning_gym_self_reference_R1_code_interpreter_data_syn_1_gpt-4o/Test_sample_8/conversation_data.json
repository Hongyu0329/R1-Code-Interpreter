    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means the number of true statements (T) is at least 2.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 4 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means the number of false statements (F) is at most 4, or equivalently, T is at least 3.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This is only possible if all statements are true, which contradicts other statements.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means T = 4.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This means either all statements are true (which is impossible) or exactly 3 statements are false (T = 4).\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - Possible prime numbers for T are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - Possible composite numbers for F are 4, 6, etc.\n\nNow, let's analyze the constraints:\n- From Statement 1, T ≥ 2.\n- From Statement 2, T ≥ 3.\n- From Statement 5, T = 4.\n- From Statement 6, T must be a prime number.\n- From Statement 7, F must be a composite number.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's check the possible values for T and F:\n- If T = 4, then F = 3, which is not a composite number.\n- If T = 5, then F = 2, which is not a composite number.\n- If T = 6, then F = 1, which is not a composite number.\n- If T = 7, then F = 0, which is not a composite number.\n\nThe only possible value for T that satisfies all conditions is T = 5, where F = 2. However, F = 2 is not a composite number, so this is not a valid solution.\n\nLet's write a Python script to verify the possible solutions:\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\npossible_solutions = 0\n\nfor T in range(2, 8):  # T can be from 2 to 7\n    F = 7 - T\n    if (T >= 2 and T >= 3 and (T == 4 or T == 7) and is_prime(T) and is_composite(F)):\n        possible_solutions += 1\n\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "The code output indicates that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. This means that the constraints provided by the statements are contradictory, and no combination of true and false statements can satisfy all the conditions simultaneously.\n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
