    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means the number of true statements (T) is at least 3.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means the number of false statements (F) is at most 3, which implies T is at least 4.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means T = 7, which is not possible because it would make all statements true, including contradictory ones.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means F = 2, which implies T = 5.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This means either T = 7 or F = 2, but not both. Since T = 7 is not possible, F = 2 must be true.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - This means T must be a prime number. Possible values for T are 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - This means F must be a composite number. Possible values for F are 4, 6, or 8.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we have:\n- From Statement 4, F = 2, which implies T = 5.\n- T = 5 is a prime number, satisfying Statement 6.\n- F = 2 is not a composite number, which contradicts Statement 7.\n\nSince F = 2 leads to a contradiction with Statement 7, we need to reconsider the possible values for T and F that satisfy all conditions.\n\nLet's use a systematic approach to find the number of possible solutions:\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\npossible_solutions = 0\n\nfor T in range(8):\n    F = 7 - T\n    if T >= 3 and F <= 3 and is_prime(T) and is_composite(F):\n        possible_solutions += 1\n\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "The code output indicates that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's review the logic to ensure everything is correct:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: T ≥ 3\n2. **Statement 2**: F ≤ 3, which implies T ≥ 4\n3. **Statement 3**: T = 7 (impossible due to contradictions)\n4. **Statement 4**: F = 2, which implies T = 5\n5. **Statement 5**: Either T = 7 or F = 2, but not both. Since T = 7 is impossible, F = 2 must be true.\n6. **Statement 6**: T is a prime number\n7. **Statement 7**: F is a composite number\n\nGiven the constraints:\n- F = 2 contradicts Statement 7, as 2 is not a composite number.\n- The only possible values for F that are composite are 4, 6, or 8, but these do not satisfy the other conditions.\n\nThus, the code correctly identifies that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions simultaneously.\n\n<<<0>>>"
