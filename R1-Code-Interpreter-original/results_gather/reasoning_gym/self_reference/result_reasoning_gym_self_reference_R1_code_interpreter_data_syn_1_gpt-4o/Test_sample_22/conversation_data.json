    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine how many of them can be true simultaneously. Let's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   - If this statement is true, then all 7 statements must be true. However, this creates a contradiction because some statements claim a different number of true statements.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   - If this statement is true, then at least 5 statements must be true.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   - If this statement is true, then exactly 4 statements are true.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   - If this statement is true, then exactly 2 statements are true.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'  \n   - This statement is a logical XOR between Statement 3 and Statement 4.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'  \n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'  \n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements are 4, 6, and 8.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If Statement 1 is true, then all statements are true, which contradicts other statements.\n- If Statement 2 is true, then at least 5 statements are true.\n- If Statement 3 is true, then exactly 4 statements are true.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then exactly 2 statements are true.\n- Statement 5 is true if either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n- Statement 6 is true if the number of true statements is a prime number.\n- Statement 7 is true if the number of false statements is a composite number.\n\nLet's write a Python script to evaluate these conditions and find the number of possible solutions.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\npossible_solutions = 0\n\nfor true_count in range(8):\n    false_count = 7 - true_count\n    \n    # Evaluate each statement\n    s1 = (true_count >= 7)\n    s2 = (false_count <= 2)\n    s3 = (true_count == 4)\n    s4 = (false_count == 5)\n    s5 = (s3 != s4)\n    s6 = is_prime(true_count)\n    s7 = is_composite(false_count)\n    \n    # Count the number of true statements\n    true_statements = sum([s1, s2, s3, s4, s5, s6, s7])\n    \n    # Check if the number of true statements matches the true_count\n    if true_statements == true_count:\n        possible_solutions += 1\n\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "The code execution indicates that there are 2 possible solutions where the conditions of the statements are satisfied. \n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<2>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
