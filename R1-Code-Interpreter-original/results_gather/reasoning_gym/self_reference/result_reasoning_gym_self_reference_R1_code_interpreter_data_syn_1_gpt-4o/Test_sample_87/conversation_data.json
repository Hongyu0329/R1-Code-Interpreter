    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine how many of them can be true simultaneously. Let's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   - If this statement is true, then all 7 statements must be true. However, this creates a contradiction because Statement 3 claims that none of the statements are true.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 4 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   - This means that at least 3 statements are true.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   - If this statement is true, it contradicts itself because it would mean that at least one statement (Statement 3) is true.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   - This implies that 4 statements are true.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'  \n   - This means that if Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 must be false, and vice versa.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'  \n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (between 0 and 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'  \n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (between 0 and 7) are 4, 6, and 8.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If Statement 3 is true, then all statements are false, which is a contradiction.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then exactly 3 statements are false, meaning 4 are true.\n- If 4 statements are true, then the number of true statements is 4, which is not a prime number, contradicting Statement 6.\n- If 4 statements are true, then 3 statements are false, which is a composite number, satisfying Statement 7.\n\nLet's check the scenario where 4 statements are true:\n\n- Statement 1: False (since not all 7 are true)\n- Statement 2: True (since at most 4 are false)\n- Statement 3: False (since not all are false)\n- Statement 4: True (since exactly 3 are false)\n- Statement 5: True (since Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false)\n- Statement 6: False (since 4 is not a prime number)\n- Statement 7: True (since 3 is a composite number)\n\nIn this scenario, Statements 2, 4, 5, and 7 are true, which satisfies the conditions. Let's verify if there are any other possible solutions by checking other combinations of true statements.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import isprime\n\n# Check all possible numbers of true statements from 0 to 7\npossible_solutions = 0\n\nfor true_count in range(8):\n    false_count = 7 - true_count\n    \n    # Check each statement's condition\n    statement_1 = (true_count >= 7)\n    statement_2 = (false_count <= 4)\n    statement_3 = (true_count == 0)\n    statement_4 = (false_count == 3)\n    statement_5 = (statement_3 != statement_4)\n    statement_6 = isprime(true_count)\n    statement_7 = (false_count in [4, 6, 8])\n    \n    # Count the number of true statements\n    true_statements = sum([statement_1, statement_2, statement_3, statement_4, statement_5, statement_6, statement_7])\n    \n    # Check if the number of true statements matches the true_count\n    if true_statements == true_count:\n        possible_solutions += 1\n\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nThe code will determine the number of possible solutions by checking each possible number of true statements and verifying if the conditions of all statements are satisfied.",
    "The code output indicates that there are 2 possible solutions where the conditions of the statements are satisfied. This means there are two different scenarios where the number of true and false statements align with the given conditions.\n\n<<<2>>>"
