    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions where these statements can be true or false.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 1 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means that not all statements can be false.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This implies that at least 5 statements must be true.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means all statements are false, which contradicts Statement 1.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means all statements are true.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This is a contradiction because Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot both be true.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - Possible prime numbers for the number of true statements are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - Possible composite numbers for the number of false statements are 4, 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If Statement 3 is true, then all statements are false, which contradicts Statement 1.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then all statements are true, which contradicts Statement 3.\n- If Statement 5 is true, then either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's check the possible combinations of true and false statements:\n\n- If 5 statements are true (since Statement 2 allows at most 2 false), then:\n  - Number of true statements = 5 (prime)\n  - Number of false statements = 2 (not composite)\n\n- If 6 statements are true, then:\n  - Number of true statements = 6 (not prime)\n  - Number of false statements = 1 (not composite)\n\n- If 7 statements are true, then:\n  - Number of true statements = 7 (prime)\n  - Number of false statements = 0 (not composite)\n\nLet's write a Python script to check these conditions and find the number of possible solutions.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\npossible_solutions = 0\n\nfor true_count in range(8):\n    false_count = 7 - true_count\n    if true_count >= 5 and is_prime(true_count) and is_composite(false_count):\n        possible_solutions += 1\n\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "The code output indicates that there are no possible solutions given the constraints. Let's re-evaluate the logic to ensure that all conditions are correctly considered.\n\n1. **Statement 1**: At least 1 statement is true.\n2. **Statement 2**: At most 2 statements are false.\n3. **Statement 3**: Exactly 0 statements are true (impossible due to Statement 1).\n4. **Statement 4**: Exactly 0 statements are false (impossible due to Statement 3).\n5. **Statement 5**: Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both (impossible due to Statements 3 and 4 being false).\n6. **Statement 6**: The number of true statements is a prime number.\n7. **Statement 7**: The number of false statements is a composite number.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's re-evaluate the possible scenarios:\n\n- If 5 statements are true, then 2 are false. This satisfies Statement 2, but 2 is not a composite number.\n- If 6 statements are true, then 1 is false. This does not satisfy Statement 6 (6 is not prime).\n- If 7 statements are true, then 0 are false. This does not satisfy Statement 7 (0 is not composite).\n\nIt seems that the constraints are too strict, and no combination satisfies all conditions simultaneously. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is indeed 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
