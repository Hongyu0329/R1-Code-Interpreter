    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means the number of true statements (T) is 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means the number of false statements (F) is 0, 1, or 2. Since there are 7 statements, T can be 5, 6, or 7.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 6 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means T = 6.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means F = 1, so T = 6.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This means either T = 6 (Statement 3 is true) or F = 1 (Statement 4 is true), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - Possible prime numbers for T are 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - Possible composite numbers for F are 4, 6, 8, etc. Since there are 7 statements, F can be 4 or 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If T = 6, then F = 1. This satisfies Statements 3 and 4, but violates Statement 5.\n- If T = 5, then F = 2. This satisfies Statement 2, but violates Statement 3 and 4.\n- If T = 7, then F = 0. This violates Statement 2.\n- If T = 3, then F = 4. This satisfies Statement 7, but violates Statement 6.\n- If T = 4, then F = 3. This violates Statement 7.\n\nLet's use Python to check the possible solutions:\n\n```python\ndef check_statements():\n    possible_solutions = 0\n    for T in range(8):  # T can be from 0 to 7\n        F = 7 - T\n        # Check each statement\n        s1 = (T >= 3)\n        s2 = (F <= 2)\n        s3 = (T == 6)\n        s4 = (F == 1)\n        s5 = (s3 != s4)\n        s6 = (T in [2, 3, 5, 7])\n        s7 = (F in [4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14])  # Composite numbers\n\n        # Count the number of true statements\n        true_statements = sum([s1, s2, s3, s4, s5, s6, s7])\n\n        # Check if the number of true statements equals T\n        if true_statements == T:\n            possible_solutions += 1\n\n    print(possible_solutions)\n\ncheck_statements()\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "The code execution indicates that there are 3 possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. \n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<3>>>"
