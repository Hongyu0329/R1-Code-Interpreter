    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means the number of true statements (T) is 3 or more.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means the number of false statements (F) is 2 or less.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means T = 1.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means F = 1.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This means either Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false, or Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - This means T is a prime number (2, 3, 5, 7).\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - This means F is a composite number (4, 6).\n\nNow, let's analyze the constraints:\n\n- From Statement 1, T ≥ 3.\n- From Statement 2, F ≤ 2.\n- From Statement 3, T = 1.\n- From Statement 4, F = 1.\n- From Statement 5, either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n- From Statement 6, T is a prime number.\n- From Statement 7, F is a composite number.\n\nLet's consider the possible values for T and F:\n\n- If T = 3, then F = 4 (since 7 - 3 = 4), which satisfies Statement 7.\n- If T = 5, then F = 2 (since 7 - 5 = 2), which does not satisfy Statement 7.\n- If T = 7, then F = 0 (since 7 - 7 = 0), which does not satisfy Statement 7.\n\nNow, let's check the consistency of these values with all statements:\n\n- For T = 3 and F = 4:\n  - Statement 1 is true (T ≥ 3).\n  - Statement 2 is false (F > 2).\n  - Statement 3 is false (T ≠ 1).\n  - Statement 4 is false (F ≠ 1).\n  - Statement 5 is true (since both Statements 3 and 4 are false).\n  - Statement 6 is true (T = 3, which is prime).\n  - Statement 7 is true (F = 4, which is composite).\n\nThus, T = 3 and F = 4 is a consistent solution.\n\nLet's write a Python script to verify this solution and check if there are any other possible solutions.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\npossible_solutions = 0\n\nfor T in range(8):\n    F = 7 - T\n    if T >= 3 and F <= 2 and is_prime(T) and is_composite(F):\n        if (T == 1 and F != 1) or (F == 1 and T != 1):\n            possible_solutions += 1\n\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the number of possible solutions.",
