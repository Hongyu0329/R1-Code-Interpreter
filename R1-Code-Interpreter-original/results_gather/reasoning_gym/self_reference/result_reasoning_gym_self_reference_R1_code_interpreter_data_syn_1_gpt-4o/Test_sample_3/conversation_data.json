    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This implies that there are either 6 or 7 true statements.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 4 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This implies that there are at most 3 true statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This implies that there are exactly 5 true statements.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This implies that there are exactly 5 true statements.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This implies that either Statement 3 is true or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - This implies that the number of true statements could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - This implies that the number of false statements could be 4 or 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If Statement 1 is true, then there are at least 6 true statements. This contradicts Statement 2, which implies at most 3 true statements. Therefore, Statement 1 cannot be true.\n\n- If Statement 2 is true, then there are at most 3 true statements. This contradicts Statement 1, which implies at least 6 true statements. Therefore, Statement 2 cannot be true.\n\n- If Statement 3 is true, then there are exactly 5 true statements. This satisfies Statement 4, but contradicts Statement 5, which states that only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true. Therefore, Statement 3 cannot be true.\n\n- If Statement 4 is true, then there are exactly 5 true statements. This satisfies Statement 3, but contradicts Statement 5, which states that only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true. Therefore, Statement 4 cannot be true.\n\n- If Statement 5 is true, then either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 can be true, Statement 5 cannot be true.\n\n- If Statement 6 is true, then the number of true statements is a prime number. This could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n- If Statement 7 is true, then the number of false statements is a composite number. This could be 4 or 6.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's write a Python script to determine the number of possible solutions.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\npossible_solutions = 0\n\nfor true_statements in range(8):\n    false_statements = 7 - true_statements\n    if is_prime(true_statements) and is_composite(false_statements):\n        possible_solutions += 1\n\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "The code execution indicates that there is only one possible solution that satisfies all the given conditions. \n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
