    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   - This implies all statements are true. If this is true, then all other statements must also be true.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   - This means there can be 0, 1, or 2 false statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   - This means there are 2 false statements.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   - This is consistent with Statement 3.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'  \n   - This means if Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 must be false, and vice versa.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'  \n   - Possible prime numbers for true statements are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'  \n   - Possible composite numbers for false statements are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If Statement 1 is true, then all statements are true, which contradicts Statements 3, 4, 5, and 7. So, Statement 1 must be false.\n- If Statement 2 is true, then there can be 0, 1, or 2 false statements.\n- If Statement 3 is true, then there are 5 true statements and 2 false statements.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then there are 5 true statements and 2 false statements.\n- Statement 5 implies that either Statement 3 or 4 is true, but not both. This means one of them must be false.\n- Statement 6 requires the number of true statements to be a prime number.\n- Statement 7 requires the number of false statements to be a composite number.\n\nLet's use Python to check the possible combinations of true and false statements that satisfy all these conditions.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import isprime\n\ndef check_statements():\n    solutions = 0\n    for true_count in range(8):\n        false_count = 7 - true_count\n        # Check each statement\n        s1 = (true_count >= 7)\n        s2 = (false_count <= 2)\n        s3 = (true_count == 5)\n        s4 = (false_count == 2)\n        s5 = (s3 != s4)\n        s6 = isprime(true_count)\n        s7 = (false_count in [4, 6])\n        \n        # Count the number of true statements\n        true_statements = sum([s1, s2, s3, s4, s5, s6, s7])\n        \n        # Check if the number of true statements matches the true_count\n        if true_statements == true_count:\n            solutions += 1\n    \n    return solutions\n\nprint(check_statements())\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "The code execution indicates that there are 2 possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. \n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
