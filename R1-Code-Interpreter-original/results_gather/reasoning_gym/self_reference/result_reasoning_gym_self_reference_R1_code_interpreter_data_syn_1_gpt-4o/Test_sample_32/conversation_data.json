    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means the number of true statements (T) is at least 2.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means the number of false statements (F) is at most 1, which implies T is at least 6.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means T = 4.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means F = 3, which implies T = 4.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This means either T = 4 or F = 3, but not both. However, since both imply T = 4, this statement is inherently contradictory if both are true.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - This means T is a prime number (2, 3, 5, 7).\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - This means F is a composite number (4, 6).\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values for T and F:\n\n- If T = 2, then F = 5. This satisfies Statement 1, but not Statement 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n- If T = 3, then F = 4. This satisfies Statement 1, 4, 6, and 7, but not Statement 2, 3, or 5.\n- If T = 4, then F = 3. This satisfies Statement 1, 3, 4, and 6, but not Statement 2, 5, or 7.\n- If T = 5, then F = 2. This satisfies Statement 1, 2, 5, and 6, but not Statement 3, 4, or 7.\n- If T = 6, then F = 1. This satisfies Statement 1, 2, and 5, but not Statement 3, 4, 6, or 7.\n- If T = 7, then F = 0. This satisfies Statement 1, 2, and 6, but not Statement 3, 4, 5, or 7.\n\nLet's write a Python script to check which combinations of T and F satisfy all the statements.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\npossible_solutions = 0\n\nfor T in range(2, 8):\n    F = 7 - T\n    if (T >= 2 and F <= 1 and (T == 4 or F == 3) and is_prime(T) and is_composite(F)):\n        possible_solutions += 1\n\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the number of possible solutions.",
