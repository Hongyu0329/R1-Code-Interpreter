    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 1 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means that not all statements can be false.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This implies that at least 4 statements are true.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This is a specific condition that can be true or false.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This is another specific condition that can be true or false.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This means that if Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 must be false, and vice versa.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (out of 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (out of 7) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If exactly 4 statements are true (Statement 3 is true), then 3 statements are false. This satisfies Statement 4, which contradicts Statement 5. Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\n- If exactly 3 statements are false (Statement 4 is true), then 4 statements are true. This satisfies Statement 3, which contradicts Statement 5. Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\n- If exactly 5 statements are true, then 2 statements are false. This satisfies Statement 6 (since 5 is a prime number) but does not satisfy Statement 7 (since 2 is not a composite number).\n\n- If exactly 6 statements are true, then 1 statement is false. This does not satisfy Statement 6 (since 6 is not a prime number) and does not satisfy Statement 7 (since 1 is not a composite number).\n\n- If exactly 7 statements are true, then 0 statements are false. This satisfies Statement 6 (since 7 is a prime number) but does not satisfy Statement 7 (since 0 is not a composite number).\n\nGiven these analyses, let's write a Python script to check the possible solutions:\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\npossible_solutions = 0\n\nfor true_count in range(8):\n    false_count = 7 - true_count\n    \n    # Check each condition\n    if true_count >= 1 and false_count <= 3:\n        if (true_count == 4) != (false_count == 3):\n            if is_prime(true_count) and is_composite(false_count):\n                possible_solutions += 1\n\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "The code output indicates that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's review the logic to ensure that all conditions are correctly implemented:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: At least 1 statement is true.\n2. **Statement 2**: At most 3 statements are false.\n3. **Statement 3**: Exactly 4 statements are true.\n4. **Statement 4**: Exactly 3 statements are false.\n5. **Statement 5**: Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n6. **Statement 6**: The number of true statements is a prime number.\n7. **Statement 7**: The number of false statements is a composite number.\n\nThe code checks these conditions for each possible number of true statements (from 0 to 7). The logic seems correct, but let's verify the conditions manually:\n\n- If 4 statements are true, then 3 are false. This satisfies both Statement 3 and Statement 4, which contradicts Statement 5.\n- If 3 statements are false, then 4 are true. This satisfies both Statement 3 and Statement 4, which contradicts Statement 5.\n- If 5 statements are true, then 2 are false. This satisfies Statement 6 but not Statement 7.\n- If 6 statements are true, then 1 is false. This does not satisfy Statement 6 or Statement 7.\n- If 7 statements are true, then 0 are false. This satisfies Statement 6 but not Statement 7.\n\nGiven these analyses, it seems that there are indeed no possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions simultaneously. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
