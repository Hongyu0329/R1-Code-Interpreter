    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This implies that there are either 6 or 7 true statements.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 4 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This implies that there are at most 3 true statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This implies that there are exactly 5 true statements.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This implies that there are exactly 5 true statements.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This implies that either Statement 3 is true or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - This implies that the number of true statements is 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - This implies that the number of false statements is 4 or 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If Statement 1 is true, then there are 6 or 7 true statements.\n- If Statement 2 is true, then there are at most 3 true statements.\n- If Statement 3 is true, then there are exactly 5 true statements.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then there are exactly 5 true statements.\n- If Statement 5 is true, then either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n- If Statement 6 is true, then the number of true statements is a prime number.\n- If Statement 7 is true, then the number of false statements is a composite number.\n\nLet's use Python to determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all these conditions.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\npossible_solutions = 0\n\nfor true_statements in range(8):\n    false_statements = 7 - true_statements\n    \n    # Check each statement\n    s1 = true_statements >= 6\n    s2 = false_statements <= 4\n    s3 = true_statements == 5\n    s4 = false_statements == 2\n    s5 = (s3 or s4) and not (s3 and s4)\n    s6 = is_prime(true_statements)\n    s7 = is_composite(false_statements)\n    \n    # Count the number of true statements\n    true_count = sum([s1, s2, s3, s4, s5, s6, s7])\n    \n    # Check if the number of true statements matches the condition\n    if true_count == true_statements:\n        possible_solutions += 1\n\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "The code execution indicates that there are 3 possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. \n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<3>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
