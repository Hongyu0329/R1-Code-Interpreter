    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This implies that the number of true statements (T) is 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This implies that the number of false statements (F) is 0 or 1, which means T is 6 or 7.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This implies T = 0, which is a contradiction if any statement is true.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This implies F = 3, which means T = 4.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This implies that if Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 is false, and vice versa.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - This implies T is a prime number, so T could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - This implies F is a composite number, so F could be 4, 6, or 8.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values for T and F:\n\n- If T = 4, then F = 3. This satisfies Statement 1, Statement 4, and Statement 5 (since Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false). However, T = 4 is not a prime number, so Statement 6 is false. F = 3 is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false. This combination does not satisfy all conditions.\n\n- If T = 5, then F = 2. This satisfies Statement 1, but not Statement 2, Statement 4, Statement 5, or Statement 7. This combination does not satisfy all conditions.\n\n- If T = 6, then F = 1. This satisfies Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 6. However, F = 1 is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false. This combination does not satisfy all conditions.\n\n- If T = 7, then F = 0. This satisfies Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 6. However, F = 0 is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false. This combination does not satisfy all conditions.\n\nGiven the constraints, let's write a Python script to check all possible combinations of truth values for the statements and count the number of valid solutions.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import isprime\n\ndef check_statements():\n    solutions = 0\n    for T in range(8):\n        F = 7 - T\n        # Check each statement\n        s1 = T >= 4\n        s2 = F <= 1\n        s3 = T == 0\n        s4 = F == 3\n        s5 = (s3 and not s4) or (s4 and not s3)\n        s6 = isprime(T)\n        s7 = F in [4, 6, 8]\n        \n        # Count the number of true statements\n        true_statements = sum([s1, s2, s3, s4, s5, s6, s7])\n        \n        # Check if the number of true statements equals T\n        if true_statements == T:\n            solutions += 1\n    \n    print(solutions)\n\ncheck_statements()\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "The code execution indicates that there is only one possible solution that satisfies all the given statements. \n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<1>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
