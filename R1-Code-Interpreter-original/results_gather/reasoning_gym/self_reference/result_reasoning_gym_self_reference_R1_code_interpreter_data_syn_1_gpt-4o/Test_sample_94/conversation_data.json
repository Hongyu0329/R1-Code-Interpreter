    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means the number of true statements (T) is 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means the number of false statements (F) is 0 or 1, which implies T is 6 or 7.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means T = 5.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means F = 2, which implies T = 5.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This means either T = 5 (Statement 3 is true) or F = 2 (Statement 4 is true), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - This means T is a prime number, so T could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - This means F is a composite number, so F could be 4, 6, or more.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values of T and F:\n\n- If T = 5, then F = 2. This satisfies Statements 3, 4, and 5. T = 5 is a prime number, satisfying Statement 6. F = 2 is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false. This is a valid solution.\n- If T = 6, then F = 1. This satisfies Statement 2. T = 6 is not a prime number, so Statement 6 is false. F = 1 is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false. This is not a valid solution.\n- If T = 7, then F = 0. This satisfies Statement 2. T = 7 is a prime number, satisfying Statement 6. F = 0 is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false. This is not a valid solution.\n\nLet's write a Python script to verify these conditions and count the number of valid solutions.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\nvalid_solutions = 0\n\nfor T in range(8):\n    F = 7 - T\n    if (T >= 4 and F <= 1 and (T == 5 or F == 2) and is_prime(T) and is_composite(F)):\n        valid_solutions += 1\n\nprint(valid_solutions)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to find the number of valid solutions.",
    "The code output indicates that there are no valid solutions based on the conditions provided. Let's re-evaluate the logic to ensure all conditions are correctly implemented.\n\nUpon reviewing the conditions, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the logic. Let's re-evaluate the conditions:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: T ≥ 4\n2. **Statement 2**: F ≤ 1\n3. **Statement 3**: T = 5\n4. **Statement 4**: F = 2\n5. **Statement 5**: Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n6. **Statement 6**: T is a prime number.\n7. **Statement 7**: F is a composite number.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the possible values of T and F:\n\n- If T = 5, then F = 2. This satisfies Statements 3, 4, and 5. T = 5 is a prime number, satisfying Statement 6. F = 2 is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false. This is a valid solution.\n- If T = 6, then F = 1. This satisfies Statement 2. T = 6 is not a prime number, so Statement 6 is false. F = 1 is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false. This is not a valid solution.\n- If T = 7, then F = 0. This satisfies Statement 2. T = 7 is a prime number, satisfying Statement 6. F = 0 is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false. This is not a valid solution.\n\nThe only valid solution is when T = 5 and F = 2. Let's correct the logic in the code to reflect this:\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\nvalid_solutions = 0\n\nfor T in range(8):\n    F = 7 - T\n    if (T >= 4 and F <= 1 and ((T == 5 and F != 2) or (F == 2 and T != 5)) and is_prime(T) and is_composite(F)):\n        valid_solutions += 1\n\nprint(valid_solutions)\n```\n\nLet's execute the corrected code to find the number of valid solutions.",
    "It seems there is still an issue with the logic in the code. Let's carefully re-evaluate the conditions and ensure they are correctly implemented in the code.\n\nThe conditions we need to satisfy are:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: T ≥ 4\n2. **Statement 2**: F ≤ 1\n3. **Statement 3**: T = 5\n4. **Statement 4**: F = 2\n5. **Statement 5**: Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n6. **Statement 6**: T is a prime number.\n7. **Statement 7**: F is a composite number.\n\nLet's analyze the possible values of T and F:\n\n- If T = 5, then F = 2. This satisfies Statements 3 and 4, but not Statement 5 (since both cannot be true simultaneously). T = 5 is a prime number, satisfying Statement 6. F = 2 is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false. This is not a valid solution.\n- If T = 6, then F = 1. This satisfies Statement 2. T = 6 is not a prime number, so Statement 6 is false. F = 1 is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false. This is not a valid solution.\n- If T = 7, then F = 0. This satisfies Statement 2. T = 7 is a prime number, satisfying Statement 6. F = 0 is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false. This is not a valid solution.\n\nIt seems there is a logical contradiction in the statements, as no combination satisfies all conditions. Let's verify this by checking the logic again:\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\nvalid_solutions = 0\n\nfor T in range(8):\n    F = 7 - T\n    if (T >= 4 and F <= 1 and ((T == 5) != (F == 2)) and is_prime(T) and is_composite(F)):\n        valid_solutions += 1\n\nprint(valid_solutions)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to confirm the number of valid solutions.",
    "The consistent output of zero valid solutions suggests that there might be a logical contradiction in the statements themselves, meaning no combination of true and false statements can satisfy all the given conditions simultaneously. Let's break down the logic one more time to ensure this conclusion is correct.\n\n1. **Statement 1**: T ≥ 4\n2. **Statement 2**: F ≤ 1\n3. **Statement 3**: T = 5\n4. **Statement 4**: F = 2\n5. **Statement 5**: Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n6. **Statement 6**: T is a prime number.\n7. **Statement 7**: F is a composite number.\n\nLet's analyze the possible values of T and F:\n\n- If T = 5, then F = 2.

F = 0 is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false. This is not a valid solution.\n\nGiven these analyses, it appears that the statements are indeed contradictory, and no valid solution exists that satisfies all conditions simultaneously.\n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
