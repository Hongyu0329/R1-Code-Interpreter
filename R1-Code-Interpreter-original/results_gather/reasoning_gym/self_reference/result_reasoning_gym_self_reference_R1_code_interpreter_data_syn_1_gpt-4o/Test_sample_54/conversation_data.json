    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This implies that there are either 6 or 7 true statements.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This implies that there are either 0, 1, or 2 false statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 6 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This implies that there is exactly 1 false statement.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This implies that all 7 statements are true.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This implies that either there is exactly 1 false statement (Statement 3 is true) or all statements are true (Statement 4 is true), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If there are 7 true statements, then Statement 4 is true, and Statement 3 is false. This satisfies Statement 5. However, 7 is a prime number, which satisfies Statement 6, but 0 is not a composite number, which contradicts Statement 7.\n\n- If there are 6 true statements, then Statement 3 is true, and Statement 4 is false. This satisfies Statement 5. However, 6 is not a prime number, which contradicts Statement 6.\n\n- If there are 5 true statements, then neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true, which contradicts Statement 5.\n\n- If there are 4 true statements, then neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true, which contradicts Statement 5.\n\n- If there are 3 true statements, then neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true, which contradicts Statement 5.\n\n- If there are 2 true statements, then neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true, which contradicts Statement 5.\n\n- If there is 1 true statement, then neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true, which contradicts Statement 5.\n\n- If there are 0 true statements, then neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true, which contradicts Statement 5.\n\nLet's use Python to verify the possible solutions:\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\npossible_solutions = 0\n\nfor true_statements in range(8):\n    false_statements = 7 - true_statements\n    \n    statement_1 = true_statements >= 6\n    statement_2 = false_statements <= 2\n    statement_3 = true_statements == 6\n    statement_4 = false_statements == 0\n    statement_5 = (statement_3 or statement_4) and not (statement_3 and statement_4)\n    statement_6 = is_prime(true_statements)\n    statement_7 = is_composite(false_statements)\n    \n    if (statement_1 and statement_2 and statement_5 and statement_6 and statement_7):\n        possible_solutions += 1\n\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "The code output indicates that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. This means that the set of statements provided is logically inconsistent, and there is no configuration of true and false statements that can satisfy all the conditions simultaneously.\n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
