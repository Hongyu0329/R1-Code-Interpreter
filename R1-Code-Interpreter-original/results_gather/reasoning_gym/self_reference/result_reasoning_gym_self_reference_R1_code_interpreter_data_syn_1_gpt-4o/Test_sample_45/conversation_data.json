    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine how many of them can be true simultaneously. Let's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 5 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   - This implies that the number of true statements is 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   - This implies that the number of true statements is 6 or 7.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   - This implies that the number of true statements is exactly 3.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   - This implies that the number of true statements is exactly 6.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'  \n   - This implies that either the number of true statements is exactly 3 or exactly 6, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'  \n   - This implies that the number of true statements is 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'  \n   - This implies that the number of false statements is 4, 6, or 8.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible number of true statements:\n\n- If there are 3 true statements:\n  - Statement 3 is true, and Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is true because either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n  - Statement 6 is true because 3 is a prime number.\n  - Statement 7 is true because 4 (7 - 3) is a composite number.\n  - Statement 1 is false because at least 5 statements are not true.\n  - Statement 2 is false because at most 1 statement is not false.\n  - This configuration satisfies all conditions.\n\n- If there are 6 true statements:\n  - Statement 4 is true, and Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is true because either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n  - Statement 6 is true because 6 is not a prime number.\n  - Statement 7 is false because 1 (7 - 6) is not a composite number.\n  - This configuration does not satisfy all conditions.\n\n- If there are 5 or 7 true statements:\n  - These configurations do not satisfy the conditions of Statements 5, 6, and 7 simultaneously.\n\nThus, the only valid configuration is when there are exactly 3 true statements. Let's confirm this with a Python script to ensure all conditions are met.\n\n```python\n# Check the validity of each configuration\ndef check_statements(true_count):\n    # Calculate false count\n    false_count = 7 - true_count\n    \n    # Evaluate each statement\n    s1 = true_count >= 5\n    s2 = false_count <= 1\n    s3 = true_count == 3\n    s4 = false_count == 1\n    s5 = (s3 or s4) and not (s3 and s4)\n    s6 = true_count in [2, 3, 5, 7]  # Prime numbers\n    s7 = false_count in [4, 6, 8]  # Composite numbers\n    \n    # Count true statements\n    true_statements = sum([s1, s2, s3, s4, s5, s6, s7])\n    \n    # Check if the number of true statements matches the true_count\n    return true_statements == true_count\n\n# Check all possible true counts\npossible_solutions = sum(check_statements(tc) for tc in range(8))\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nThe code will check each possible number of true statements and count how many configurations satisfy all conditions. Let's execute the code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "The code output indicates that there are 2 possible solutions where the conditions of the statements are satisfied. This means there are two configurations of truth values for the statements that meet all the given conditions.\n\n<<<2>>>"
