    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - If this is true, then 6 or 7 statements are true.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - If this is true, then 0 or 1 statement is false.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 6 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - If this is true, then exactly 6 statements are true.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - If this is true, then exactly 5 statements are false.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This is a XOR condition between Statement 3 and Statement 4.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (out of 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (out of 7) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If 6 statements are true:\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is true.\n  - Statement 3 is true.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false).\n  - Statement 6 is true (6 is not a prime number, so this is false).\n  - Statement 7 is false (1 false statement is not a composite number).\n\n- If 7 statements are true:\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is true.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is false (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is true (7 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is false (0 false statements is not a composite number).\n\n- If 5 statements are true:\n  - Statement 1 is false.\n  - Statement 2 is false.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is true.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false).\n  - Statement 6 is true (5 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (2 false statements is not a composite number).\n\nLet's write a Python script to check these conditions and find the number of possible solutions.\n\n```python\ndef check_statements():\n    possible_solutions = 0\n    for true_count in range(8):\n        false_count = 7 - true_count\n        \n        # Check each statement\n        s1 = (true_count >= 6)\n        s2 = (false_count <= 1)\n        s3 = (true_count == 6)\n        s4 = (false_count == 5)\n        s5 = (s3 != s4)\n        s6 = (true_count in [2, 3, 5, 7])\n        s7 = (false_count in [4, 6])\n        \n        # Check if the configuration is valid\n        if sum([s1, s2, s3, s4, s5, s6, s7]) == true_count:\n            possible_solutions += 1\n    \n    return possible_solutions\n\nprint(check_statements())\n```\n\nThe code will determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code execution indicates that there are 2 possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. \n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<2>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
