    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   This means the number of true statements, \\( T \\), is \\( T \\geq 2 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 4 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   This implies the number of false statements, \\( F \\), is \\( F \\leq 4 \\). Since there are 7 statements in total, \\( T = 7 - F \\), so \\( T \\geq 3 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   This implies \\( T = 4 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   This implies \\( F = 3 \\), so \\( T = 4 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'  \n   This means either \\( T = 4 \\) or \\( F = 3 \\), but not both. However, since both imply \\( T = 4 \\), this statement is inherently contradictory if both are true.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'  \n   The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. So, \\( T \\) could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'  \n   The composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6. So, \\( F \\) could be 4 or 6.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the possible values of \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) that satisfy all these conditions:\n\n- If \\( T = 4 \\), then \\( F = 3 \\). This satisfies Statements 3, 4, and 5 (since both 3 and 4 imply \\( T = 4 \\), but Statement 5 requires only one to be true, which is a contradiction). However, this does not satisfy Statement 6 (since 4 is not a prime number) and Statement 7 (since 3 is not a composite number).\n\n- If \\( T = 3 \\), then \\( F = 4 \\). This satisfies Statement 2, Statement 6 (since 3 is a prime number), and Statement 7 (since 4 is a composite number). However, it does not satisfy Statement 3 or 4, and thus Statement 5 is not satisfied.\n\n- If \\( T = 5 \\), then \\( F = 2 \\). This satisfies Statement 1, Statement 6 (since 5 is a prime number), but not Statement 7 (since 2 is not a composite number).\n\n- If \\( T = 2 \\), then \\( F = 5 \\). This satisfies Statement 1, but not Statement 2, Statement 6 (since 2 is a prime number), and Statement 7 (since 5 is not a composite number).\n\n- If \\( T = 7 \\), then \\( F = 0 \\). This satisfies Statement 6 (since 7 is a prime number), but not Statement 7 (since 0 is not a composite number).\n\nGiven these evaluations, let's write a Python script to check the possible values of \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) that satisfy all the conditions.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\npossible_solutions = 0\n\nfor T in range(2, 8):  # T can be from 2 to 7\n    F = 7 - T\n    if (T >= 2 and F <= 4 and\n        ((T == 4 and F != 3) or (T != 4 and F == 3)) and\n        is_prime(T) and is_composite(F)):\n        possible_solutions += 1\n\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "The code output indicates that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements. Let's review the logic and constraints to ensure everything is correctly implemented:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \\( T \\geq 2 \\)\n2. **Statement 2**: \\( F \\leq 4 \\) implies \\( T \\geq 3 \\)\n3. **Statement 3**: \\( T = 4 \\)\n4. **Statement 4**: \\( F = 3 \\) implies \\( T = 4 \\)\n5. **Statement 5**: Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This is inherently contradictory if both imply \\( T = 4 \\).\n6. **Statement 6**: \\( T \\) is a prime number (2, 3, 5, 7)\n7. **Statement 7**: \\( F \\) is a composite number (4, 6)\n\nGiven the constraints, let's re-evaluate the logic:\n\n- If \\( T = 4 \\), both Statements 3 and 4 are true, which contradicts Statement 5.\n- If \\( T = 3 \\), it satisfies Statement 6 and Statement 7, but not Statement 3 or 4, thus not satisfying Statement 5.\n- If \\( T = 5 \\), it satisfies Statement 6, but not Statement 7.\n- If \\( T = 2 \\), it satisfies Statement 6, but not Statement 7.\n- If \\( T = 7 \\), it satisfies Statement 6, but not Statement 7.\n\nThe code correctly evaluates these conditions, and the result of 0 indicates that no combination of true and false statements satisfies all the given conditions simultaneously.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
