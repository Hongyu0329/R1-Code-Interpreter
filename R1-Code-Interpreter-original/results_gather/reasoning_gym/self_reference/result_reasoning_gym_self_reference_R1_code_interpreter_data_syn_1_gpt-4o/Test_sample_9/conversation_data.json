    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means the number of true statements (T) is \\( T \\geq 3 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 7 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This is trivially true because there are only 7 statements, so the number of false statements (F) is \\( F \\leq 7 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means \\( T = 4 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means \\( F = 3 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This means either \\( T = 4 \\) or \\( F = 3 \\), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - This means \\( T \\) is a prime number.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - This means \\( F \\) is a composite number.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values for \\( T \\) and \\( F \\):\n\n- Since there are 7 statements, \\( T + F = 7 \\).\n- Possible values for \\( T \\) (considering it must be a prime number) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n- Possible values for \\( F \\) (considering it must be a composite number) are 4 and 6.\n\nLet's check each possible value of \\( T \\) and see if it satisfies all conditions:\n\n- **\\( T = 3 \\), \\( F = 4 \\)**:\n  - Satisfies Statement 1 (\\( T \\geq 3 \\)).\n  - Satisfies Statement 2 (\\( F \\leq 7 \\)).\n  - Does not satisfy Statement 3 (\\( T \\neq 4 \\)).\n  - Satisfies Statement 4 (\\( F = 3 \\)).\n  - Satisfies Statement 5 (either Statement 3 or 4 is true, but not both).\n  - Satisfies Statement 6 (\\( T = 3 \\) is prime).\n  - Satisfies Statement 7 (\\( F = 4 \\) is composite).\n\n- **\\( T = 5 \\), \\( F = 2 \\)**:\n  - Satisfies Statement 1 (\\( T \\geq 3 \\)).\n  - Satisfies Statement 2 (\\( F \\leq 7 \\)).\n  - Does not satisfy Statement 3 (\\( T \\neq 4 \\)).\n  - Does not satisfy Statement 4 (\\( F \\neq 3 \\)).\n  - Satisfies Statement 5 (either Statement 3 or 4 is true, but not both).\n  - Satisfies Statement 6 (\\( T = 5 \\) is prime).\n  - Does not satisfy Statement 7 (\\( F = 2 \\) is not composite).\n\n- **\\( T = 7 \\), \\( F = 0 \\)**:\n  - Satisfies Statement 1 (\\( T \\geq 3 \\)).\n  - Satisfies Statement 2 (\\( F \\leq 7 \\)).\n  - Does not satisfy Statement 3 (\\( T \\neq 4 \\)).\n  - Does not satisfy Statement 4 (\\( F \\neq 3 \\)).\n  - Satisfies Statement 5 (either Statement 3 or 4 is true, but not both).\n  - Satisfies Statement 6 (\\( T = 7 \\) is prime).\n  - Does not satisfy Statement 7 (\\( F = 0 \\) is not composite).\n\nFrom the analysis, only \\( T = 3 \\) and \\( F = 4 \\) satisfy all the conditions. Therefore, there is only one possible solution.\n\n<<<1>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
