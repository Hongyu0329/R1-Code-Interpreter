    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - If this statement is true, then there are 6 or 7 true statements.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - If this statement is true, then there are 0 to 5 false statements, which means there are 2 to 7 true statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - If this statement is true, then there are exactly 3 true statements.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements is false.'\n   - If this statement is true, then there are exactly 6 true statements.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This means either Statement 3 is true or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (between 0 and 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (between 0 and 7) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If Statement 1 is true, then there are 6 or 7 true statements.\n- If Statement 2 is true, then there are 2 to 7 true statements.\n- If Statement 3 is true, then there are exactly 3 true statements.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then there are exactly 6 true statements.\n- If Statement 5 is true, then either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n- If Statement 6 is true, then the number of true statements is a prime number (2, 3, 5, or 7).\n- If Statement 7 is true, then the number of false statements is a composite number (4 or 6).\n\nLet's use Python to check the possible number of true statements that satisfy all these conditions.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\npossible_solutions = 0\n\nfor true_statements in range(8):\n    false_statements = 7 - true_statements\n    \n    # Check each condition\n    cond1 = true_statements >= 6\n    cond2 = false_statements <= 5\n    cond3 = true_statements == 3\n    cond4 = true_statements == 6\n    cond5 = (cond3 or cond4) and not (cond3 and cond4)\n    cond6 = is_prime(true_statements)\n    cond7 = is_composite(false_statements)\n    \n    # All conditions must be satisfied\n    if cond1 and cond2 and cond5 and cond6 and cond7:\n        possible_solutions += 1\n\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nThe code will determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code output indicates that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's re-evaluate the conditions to ensure they are correctly implemented and consistent with the problem statement.\n\nUpon reviewing the conditions, it seems there might be a logical inconsistency in the problem itself, as the conditions are quite restrictive. Let's analyze the conditions again:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: At least 6 statements are true.\n2. **Statement 2**: At most 5 statements are false.\n3. **Statement 3**: Exactly 3 statements are true.\n4. **Statement 4**: Exactly 1 statement is false.\n5. **Statement 5**: Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n6. **Statement 6**: The number of true statements is a prime number.\n7. **Statement 7**: The number of false statements is a composite number.\n\nLet's consider the implications:\n\n- If Statement 1 is true, then there are 6 or 7 true statements.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then there are 6 true statements.\n- If Statement 5 is true, then either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This implies that if Statement 4 is true, Statement 3 must be false.\n- If Statement 6 is true, the number of true statements must be a prime number (2, 3, 5, or 7).\n- If Statement 7 is true, the number of false statements must be a composite number (4 or 6).\n\nGiven these conditions, let's re-evaluate the possible scenarios:\n\n- If there are 6 true statements, then Statement 4 is true, and Statement 3 is false.\n- If there are 6 true statements, the number of true statements (6) is not a prime number, which contradicts Statement 6.\n- If there are 7 true statements, then Statement 1 is true, but the number of true statements (7) is a prime number, which satisfies Statement 6, but the number of false statements (0) is not a composite number, which contradicts Statement 7.\n\nIt seems that the conditions are inherently contradictory, leading to no possible solutions. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is indeed 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
