    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine how many of them can be true simultaneously. Let's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.'\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.'\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.'\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false.'\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- **Statement 4**: If this statement is true, then all statements are false, which is a contradiction. Therefore, Statement 4 must be false.\n\n- **Statement 5**: Since Statement 4 is false, Statement 3 must be true for Statement 5 to be true.\n\n- **Statement 3**: If this is true, then exactly 4 statements are true.\n\n- **Statement 1**: If exactly 4 statements are true, then Statement 1 is true because 4 is at least 4.\n\n- **Statement 2**: If exactly 4 statements are true, then 3 statements are false, which satisfies Statement 2.\n\n- **Statement 6**: If exactly 4 statements are true, then the number of true statements (4) is not a prime number. Therefore, Statement 6 is false.\n\n- **Statement 7**: If exactly 4 statements are true, then 3 statements are false, which is not a composite number. Therefore, Statement 7 is false.\n\nNow, let's verify the consistency of this scenario:\n\n- True statements: 1, 2, 3, 5\n- False statements: 4, 6, 7\n\nThis scenario satisfies all the conditions given by the statements. Therefore, there is only one possible solution where exactly 4 statements are true.\n\nLet's confirm this by writing a Python script to check all possible combinations of true and false statements:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\ndef check_statements(true_statements):\n    num_true = len(true_statements)\n    num_false = 7 - num_true\n    \n    # Check each statement\n    s1 = num_true >= 4\n    s2 = num_false <= 5\n    s3 = num_true == 4\n    s4 = num_false == 7\n    s5 = (s3 or s4) and not (s3 and s4)\n    s6 = is_prime(num_true)\n    s7 = is_composite(num_false)\n    \n    # Determine which statements are true\n    true_set = {1, 2, 3, 5}\n    false_set = {4, 6, 7}\n    \n    return (s1, s2, s3, s4, s5, s6, s7) == (s1 in true_set, s2 in true_set, s3 in true_set, s4 in true_set, s5 in true_set, s6 in true_set, s7 in true_set)\n\n# Check all combinations of true statements\npossible_solutions = 0\nfor true_statements in combinations(range(1, 8), 4):\n    if check_statements(true_statements):\n        possible_solutions += 1\n\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nThis code will check all combinations of 4 true statements and verify if they satisfy the conditions given by the statements. Let's execute the code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "It seems there was an error in the logic of the code.

    "The code now correctly checks each possible number of true statements and verifies if the conditions are satisfied.
