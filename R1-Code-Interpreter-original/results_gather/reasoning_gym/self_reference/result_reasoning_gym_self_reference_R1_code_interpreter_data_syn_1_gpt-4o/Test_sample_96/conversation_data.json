    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine how many of them can be true simultaneously. Let's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   - If this statement is true, then all 7 statements must be true. However, this creates a contradiction because Statement 3 claims only 1 statement is true, and Statement 4 claims 5 statements are false. Therefore, Statement 1 cannot be true.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   - If this statement is true, then at least 5 statements are true. This is possible, but we need to check for consistency with other statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   - If this statement is true, then all other statements must be false. This creates a contradiction because Statement 3 itself would be false if only one statement is true. Therefore, Statement 3 cannot be true.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   - If this statement is true, then 2 statements are true. This is possible, but we need to check for consistency with other statements.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'  \n   - Since Statement 3 cannot be true, Statement 4 must be true for Statement 5 to be true.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'  \n   - If Statement 4 is true, then 2 statements are true, which is a prime number. Therefore, Statement 6 can be true.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'  \n   - If Statement 4 is true, then 5 statements are false, which is a composite number. Therefore, Statement 7 can be true.\n\nNow, let's check the consistency of the scenario where Statements 4, 5, 6, and 7 are true:\n\n- If Statement 4 is true, then 2 statements are true.\n- Statement 5 is true because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 6 is true because 2 is a prime number.\n- Statement 7 is true because 5 is a composite number.\n\nThis scenario is consistent. Let's verify if there are any other possible solutions by checking other combinations of true statements. We will use Python code to automate this process.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Define the statements as functions\ndef statement_1(truths):\n    return truths >= 7\n\ndef statement_2(truths):\n    return truths <= 5\n\ndef statement_3(truths):\n    return truths == 1\n\ndef statement_4(truths):\n    return truths == 2\n\ndef statement_5(truths):\n    return (statement_3(truths) or statement_4(truths)) and not (statement_3(truths) and statement_4(truths))\n\ndef statement_6(truths):\n    return truths in {2, 3, 5, 7}  # Prime numbers\n\ndef statement_7(falses):\n    return falses in {4, 6}  # Composite numbers\n\n# Check all combinations of true statements\npossible_solutions = 0\nfor truths in range(8):\n    falses = 7 - truths\n    if (statement_1(truths) and\n        statement_2(truths) and\n        statement_3(truths) and\n        statement_4(truths) and\n        statement_5(truths) and\n        statement_6(truths) and\n        statement_7(falses)):\n        possible_solutions += 1\n\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "The code output indicates that there are no possible solutions based on the current logic.

Let's correct the logic and re-evaluate the possible solutions:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   - This statement is false because it leads to contradictions.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   - This statement can be true if 5 or more statements are true.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   - This statement is false because it leads to contradictions.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   - This statement can be true if 2 statements are true.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'  \n   - This statement is true if Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'  \n   - This statement is true if the number of true statements is 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'  \n   - This statement is true if the number of false statements is 4, 6, or more.\n\nLet's correct the code logic and re-run the analysis:\n\n```python\n# Define the statements as functions\ndef statement_1(truths):\n    return truths >= 7\n\ndef statement_2(truths):\n    return truths >= 5\n\ndef statement_3(truths):\n    return truths == 1\n\ndef statement_4(truths):\n    return truths == 2\n\ndef statement_5(truths):\n    return (statement_3(truths) or statement_4(truths)) and not (statement_3(truths) and statement_4(truths))\n\ndef statement_6(truths):\n    return truths in {2, 3, 5, 7}  # Prime numbers\n\ndef statement_7(falses):\n    return falses in {4, 6}  # Composite numbers\n\n# Check all combinations of true statements\npossible_solutions = 0\nfor truths in range(8):\n    falses = 7 - truths\n    if (not statement_1(truths) and\n        statement_2(truths) and\n        not statement_3(truths) and\n        statement_4(truths) and\n        statement_5(truths) and\n        statement_6(truths) and\n        statement_7(falses)):\n        possible_solutions += 1\n\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nLet's execute the corrected code to find the number of possible solutions.",
