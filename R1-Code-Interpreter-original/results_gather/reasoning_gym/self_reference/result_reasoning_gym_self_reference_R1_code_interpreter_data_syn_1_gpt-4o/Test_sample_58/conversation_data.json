    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means the number of true statements (T) is at least 2.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 4 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means the number of false statements (F) is at most 4, or equivalently, T is at least 3.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means T = 5.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means F = 2, or equivalently, T = 5.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This means either T = 5 (from Statement 3) or T = 5 (from Statement 4), but not both. However, since both statements imply T = 5, this condition is always satisfied if T = 5.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - This means T is a prime number. The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - This means F is a composite number. The composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values of T and F:\n\n- If T = 5, then F = 2. This satisfies all conditions:\n  - Statement 1: True (since T = 5 >= 2)\n  - Statement 2: True (since F = 2 <= 4)\n  - Statement 3: True (since T = 5)\n  - Statement 4: True (since F = 2)\n  - Statement 5: True (since either Statement 3 or 4 is true, but not both)\n  - Statement 6: True (since 5 is a prime number)\n  - Statement 7: True (since 2 is not a composite number, but this is irrelevant as F = 2 is not a composite number)\n\n- If T = 3, then F = 4. This satisfies all conditions:\n  - Statement 1: True (since T = 3 >= 2)\n  - Statement 2: True (since F = 4 <= 4)\n  - Statement 3: False (since T != 5)\n  - Statement 4: False (since F != 2)\n  - Statement 5: True (since neither Statement 3 nor 4 is true)\n  - Statement 6: True (since 3 is a prime number)\n  - Statement 7: True (since 4 is a composite number)\n\n- If T = 2, then F = 5. This does not satisfy all conditions:\n  - Statement 1: True (since T = 2 >= 2)\n  - Statement 2: False (since F = 5 > 4)\n  - Statement 3: False (since T != 5)\n  - Statement 4: False (since F != 2)\n  - Statement 5: True (since neither Statement 3 nor 4 is true)\n  - Statement 6: True (since 2 is a prime number)\n  - Statement 7: False (since 5 is not a composite number)\n\n- If T = 7, then F = 0. This does not satisfy all conditions:\n  - Statement 1: True (since T = 7 >= 2)\n  - Statement 2: False (since F = 0 > 4)\n  - Statement 3: False (since T != 5)\n  - Statement 4: False (since F != 2)\n  - Statement 5: True (since neither Statement 3 nor 4 is true)\n  - Statement 6: True (since 7 is a prime number)\n  - Statement 7: False (since 0 is not a composite number)\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to verify these conditions and count the number of possible solutions.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\npossible_solutions = 0\n\nfor T in range(8):\n    F = 7 - T\n    if (T >= 2 and F <= 4 and\n        ((T == 5) != (F == 2)) and\n        is_prime(T) and\n        is_composite(F)):\n        possible_solutions += 1\n\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "The code output indicates that there are no possible solutions, which suggests an error in the logic or conditions. Let's re-evaluate the conditions and correct any mistakes.\n\nUpon reviewing the conditions, I noticed a mistake in the logic for Statement 5. The condition `(T == 5) != (F == 2)` is incorrect because both conditions imply the same thing (T = 5).
