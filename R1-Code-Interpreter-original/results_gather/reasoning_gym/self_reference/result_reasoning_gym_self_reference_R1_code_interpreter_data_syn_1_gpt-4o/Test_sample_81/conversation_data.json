    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   - This implies all statements are true.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   - This implies at least 2 statements are true.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   - This implies 3 statements are true.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   - This implies all statements are true.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'  \n   - This implies either 3 statements are true or all are true, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'  \n   - Possible prime numbers for true statements are 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'  \n   - Possible composite numbers for false statements are 4 or 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If all statements are true (7 true, 0 false), then:\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is true.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is true.\n  - Statement 5 is false (since both 3 and 4 cannot be true).\n  - Statement 6 is true (7 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is false (0 is not a composite number).\n\n- If exactly 3 statements are true (3 true, 4 false), then:\n  - Statement 1 is false.\n  - Statement 2 is true.\n  - Statement 3 is true.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since either 3 or 4 is true, but not both).\n  - Statement 6 is true (3 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (4 is a composite number).\n\nNow, let's check if there are any other possible solutions by writing a Python script to verify the conditions:\n\n```python\ndef check_statements():\n    possible_solutions = 0\n    for true_count in range(8):\n        false_count = 7 - true_count\n        \n        # Check each statement\n        s1 = (true_count >= 7)\n        s2 = (false_count <= 5)\n        s3 = (true_count == 3)\n        s4 = (false_count == 0)\n        s5 = (s3 != s4)\n        s6 = (true_count in [2, 3, 5, 7])\n        s7 = (false_count in [4, 6])\n        \n        # Count the number of true statements\n        true_statements = sum([s1, s2, s3, s4, s5, s6, s7])\n        \n        # Check if the number of true statements matches the true_count\n        if true_statements == true_count:\n            possible_solutions += 1\n    \n    print(possible_solutions)\n\ncheck_statements()\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "Based on the code execution, there are 3 possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. \n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<3>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
