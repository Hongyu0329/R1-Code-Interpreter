    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   - This implies all statements are true. If this is true, then all other statements must also be true.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   - This means there can be 0, 1, 2, or 3 false statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   - This means there are 3 false statements.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   - This is the same as Statement 3, meaning there are 4 true statements.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'  \n   - This means one of them is true, and the other is false. However, since they are identical, this statement is inherently false.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'  \n   - Possible prime numbers for true statements are 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'  \n   - Possible composite numbers for false statements are 4 or 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the consistency:\n\n- If Statement 1 is true, then all statements are true, which contradicts Statement 5.\n- If Statement 3 is true, then there are 4 true statements, which means 3 false statements. This satisfies Statement 4, contradicting Statement 5.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then there are 3 false statements, which means 4 true statements. This satisfies Statement 3, contradicting Statement 5.\n- Statement 5 is inherently false because Statements 3 and 4 are identical.\n- Statement 6 requires the number of true statements to be a prime number.\n- Statement 7 requires the number of false statements to be a composite number.\n\nLet's use Python to check the possible combinations of true and false statements that satisfy all conditions:\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\npossible_solutions = 0\n\nfor true_statements in range(8):\n    false_statements = 7 - true_statements\n    if (true_statements >= 7 and false_statements <= 0) or (false_statements >= 4):\n        continue\n    if is_prime(true_statements) and is_composite(false_statements):\n        possible_solutions += 1\n\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nThe code will determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code output indicates that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's review the logic to ensure it aligns with the problem's requirements:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: If true, all statements are true, which is not possible due to contradictions with other statements.\n2. **Statement 2**: Allows for up to 3 false statements.\n3. **Statement 3 and 4**: Both imply 4 true and 3 false statements, but Statement 5 makes it impossible for both to be true.\n4. **Statement 5**: Cannot be true because Statements 3 and 4 are identical.\n5. **Statement 6**: Requires a prime number of true statements.\n6. **Statement 7**: Requires a composite number of false statements.\n\nGiven these constraints, the code correctly identifies that no combination of true and false statements satisfies all conditions simultaneously.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
