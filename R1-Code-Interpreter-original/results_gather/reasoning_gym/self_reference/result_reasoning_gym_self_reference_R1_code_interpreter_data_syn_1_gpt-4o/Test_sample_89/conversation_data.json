    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means the number of true statements (T) is \\( T \\geq 3 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 4 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means the number of false statements (F) is \\( F \\leq 4 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means \\( T = 7 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means \\( F = 3 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This means either \\( T = 7 \\) or \\( F = 3 \\), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - This means \\( T \\) is a prime number.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - This means \\( F \\) is a composite number.\n\nNow, let's analyze the constraints:\n\n- From Statement 1, \\( T \\geq 3 \\).\n- From Statement 2, \\( F \\leq 4 \\).\n- Since there are 7 statements, \\( T + F = 7 \\).\n\nLet's consider possible values for \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) that satisfy all conditions:\n\n- If \\( T = 7 \\), then \\( F = 0 \\). This satisfies Statement 3, but not Statement 4, and \\( F \\) is not composite.\n- If \\( T = 6 \\), then \\( F = 1 \\). This does not satisfy Statement 6 (6 is not prime) or Statement 7 (1 is not composite).\n- If \\( T = 5 \\), then \\( F = 2 \\). This satisfies Statement 6 (5 is prime), but not Statement 7 (2 is not composite).\n- If \\( T = 4 \\), then \\( F = 3 \\). This does not satisfy Statement 6 (4 is not prime), but satisfies Statement 7 (3 is not composite).\n- If \\( T = 3 \\), then \\( F = 4 \\). This satisfies Statement 6 (3 is prime) and Statement 7 (4 is composite).\n\nNow, let's check which combinations satisfy all the conditions:\n\n- \\( T = 3 \\), \\( F = 4 \\) satisfies:\n  - Statement 1: \\( T \\geq 3 \\).\n  - Statement 2: \\( F \\leq 4 \\).\n  - Statement 4: \\( F = 3 \\) is false, so Statement 5 is satisfied.\n  - Statement 6: \\( T = 3 \\) is prime.\n  - Statement 7: \\( F = 4 \\) is composite.\n\nLet's write a Python script to verify these conditions and count the number of solutions.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\nsolutions = 0\n\nfor T in range(3, 8):  # T must be at least 3 and at most 7\n    F = 7 - T\n    if F <= 4 and ((T == 7) != (F == 3)) and is_prime(T) and is_composite(F):\n        solutions += 1\n\nprint(solutions)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the number of possible solutions.",
