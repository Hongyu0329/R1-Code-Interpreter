    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of possible solutions where the given statements can be true. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means the number of true statements \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 4 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means the number of false statements \\( F \\leq 4 \\), which implies \\( T \\geq 3 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means \\( T = 2 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means \\( F = 7 \\), which implies \\( T = 0 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This means either \\( T = 2 \\) or \\( T = 0 \\), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - Possible prime numbers for \\( T \\) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - Possible composite numbers for \\( F \\) are 4, 6, and 8.\n\nNow, let's analyze the constraints:\n\n- From Statements 1 and 2, we have \\( T \\geq 4 \\) and \\( T \\geq 3 \\), respectively. So, \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n- From Statement 5, either \\( T = 2 \\) or \\( T = 0 \\), but these contradict the previous constraints.\n- From Statement 6, \\( T \\) must be a prime number.\n- From Statement 7, \\( F \\) must be a composite number.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's check the possible values for \\( T \\) and \\( F \\):\n\n- If \\( T = 5 \\), then \\( F = 2 \\), which is not composite.\n- If \\( T = 7 \\), then \\( F = 0 \\), which is not composite.\n- If \\( T = 3 \\), then \\( F = 4 \\), which is composite.\n\nLet's verify if \\( T = 3 \\) satisfies all conditions:\n\n- Statement 1: \\( T \\geq 4 \\) is false.\n- Statement 2: \\( F \\leq 4 \\) is true.\n- Statement 3: \\( T = 2 \\) is false.\n- Statement 4: \\( T = 0 \\) is false.\n- Statement 5: Either Statement 3 or 4 is true, but not both. Both are false, so this is false.\n- Statement 6: \\( T = 3 \\) is a prime number, so this is true.\n- Statement 7: \\( F = 4 \\) is a composite number, so this is true.\n\nNow, let's count the number of possible solutions. We will write a Python script to check all possible combinations of true and false statements and count the valid ones.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import product\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\ndef count_valid_solutions():\n    count = 0\n    for truth_values in product([True, False], repeat=7):\n        T = sum(truth_values)\n        F = 7 - T\n        \n        # Check each statement\n        s1 = T >= 4\n        s2 = F <= 4\n        s3 = T == 2\n        s4 = F == 7\n        s5 = (s3 or s4) and not (s3 and s4)\n        s6 = is_prime(T)\n        s7 = is_composite(F)\n        \n        # Check if the truth values satisfy the conditions\n        if (s1 == truth_values[0] and\n            s2 == truth_values[1] and\n            s3 == truth_values[2] and\n            s4 == truth_values[3] and\n            s5 == truth_values[4] and\n            s6 == truth_values[5] and\n            s7 == truth_values[6]):\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\nprint(count_valid_solutions())\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the number of possible solutions.",
