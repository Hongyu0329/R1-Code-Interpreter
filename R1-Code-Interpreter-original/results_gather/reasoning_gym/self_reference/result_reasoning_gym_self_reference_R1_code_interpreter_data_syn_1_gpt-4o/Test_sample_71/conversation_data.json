    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means the number of true statements (T) is 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 4 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means the number of false statements (F) is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means T = 4.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means F = 3.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This means either T = 4 or F = 3, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - Possible prime numbers for T are 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - Possible composite numbers for F are 4, 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values for T and F:\n\n- From Statement 1 and Statement 2, we have:\n  - T = 4, 5, 6, or 7\n  - F = 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4\n\n- From Statement 5, we have:\n  - Either T = 4 or F = 3, but not both.\n\n- From Statement 6, T must be a prime number: 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n- From Statement 7, F must be a composite number: 4 or 6.\n\nLet's write a Python script to find the number of possible solutions that satisfy all these conditions.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\npossible_solutions = 0\n\nfor T in range(8):\n    F = 7 - T\n    if (T >= 4 and F <= 4 and\n        ((T == 4) != (F == 3)) and\n        is_prime(T) and\n        is_composite(F)):\n        possible_solutions += 1\n\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "The code output indicates that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's review the logic to ensure everything is correct:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: T must be at least 4.\n2. **Statement 2**: F must be at most 4.\n3. **Statement 5**: Either T = 4 or F = 3, but not both.\n4. **Statement 6**: T must be a prime number (2, 3, 5, or 7).\n5. **Statement 7**: F must be a composite number (4 or 6).\n\nGiven these constraints, let's manually verify:\n\n- If T = 4, then F = 3. This satisfies Statement 5, but F = 3 is not a composite number, violating Statement 7.\n- If T = 5, then F = 2. T = 5 is a prime number, but F = 2 is not a composite number, violating Statement 7.\n- If T = 6, then F = 1. T = 6 is not a prime number, violating Statement 6.\n- If T = 7, then F = 0. T = 7 is a prime number, but F = 0 is not a composite number, violating Statement 7.\n\nIt seems that the constraints are too strict, and no combination of T and F satisfies all the conditions simultaneously. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is indeed 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
