    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - If this statement is true, then there are either 6 or 7 true statements.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 7 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This statement is always true because there cannot be more than 7 false statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - If this statement is true, then there are exactly 5 true statements.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - If this statement is true, then there are exactly 5 true statements (since 7 - 2 = 5).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This means one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. If Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 is false, and vice versa.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (from 0 to 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (from 0 to 7) are 4, 6, and 8.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If Statement 1 is true, then there are 6 or 7 true statements.\n- If Statement 3 is true, then there are exactly 5 true statements.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then there are exactly 5 true statements.\n- Statement 5 implies that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n- Statement 6 requires the number of true statements to be a prime number.\n- Statement 7 requires the number of false statements to be a composite number.\n\nLet's use Python to check the possible combinations of true and false statements that satisfy all these conditions.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\npossible_solutions = 0\n\nfor true_statements in range(8):\n    false_statements = 7 - true_statements\n    \n    # Check conditions\n    if true_statements >= 6:  # Statement 1\n        if true_statements == 5:  # Statement 3\n            if false_statements == 2:  # Statement 4\n                if is_prime(true_statements):  # Statement 6\n                    if is_composite(false_statements):  # Statement 7\n                        possible_solutions += 1\n\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the number of possible solutions.",
