    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - If this statement is true, then there are either 6 or 7 true statements.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 4 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - If this statement is true, then there are at most 4 false statements, meaning there are at least 3 true statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - If this statement is true, then there are exactly 4 true statements.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - If this statement is true, then there are exactly 4 true statements (since 7 - 3 = 4).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This means one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This implies exactly 4 true statements.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If Statement 1 is true, then there are 6 or 7 true statements.\n- If Statement 2 is true, then there are at least 3 true statements.\n- If Statement 3 is true, then there are exactly 4 true statements.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then there are exactly 4 true statements.\n- If Statement 5 is true, then there are exactly 4 true statements.\n- If Statement 6 is true, then the number of true statements is a prime number.\n- If Statement 7 is true, then the number of false statements is a composite number.\n\nLet's consider the possible number of true statements:\n\n- **4 true statements**: \n  - This satisfies Statement 3, Statement 4, and Statement 5.\n  - The number of false statements is 3, which is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false.\n  - The number of true statements is not a prime number, so Statement 6 is false.\n\n- **5 true statements**:\n  - This satisfies Statement 6 (since 5 is a prime number).\n  - The number of false statements is 2, which is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false.\n\n- **6 true statements**:\n  - This satisfies Statement 1 and Statement 6 (since 6 is not a prime number, Statement 6 is false).\n  - The number of false statements is 1, which is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false.\n\n- **7 true statements**:\n  - This satisfies Statement 1 and Statement 6 (since 7 is a prime number).\n  - The number of false statements is 0, which is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false.\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to check the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\npossible_solutions = 0\n\nfor true_statements in range(8):\n    false_statements = 7 - true_statements\n    \n    # Check each statement\n    statement_1 = true_statements >= 6\n    statement_2 = false_statements <= 4\n    statement_3 = true_statements == 4\n    statement_4 = false_statements == 3\n    statement_5 = (statement_3 or statement_4) and not (statement_3 and statement_4)\n    statement_6 = is_prime(true_statements)\n    statement_7 = is_composite(false_statements)\n    \n    # Check if all conditions are satisfied\n    if (statement_1 and statement_2 and statement_5 and statement_6 and statement_7):\n        possible_solutions += 1\n\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "The code output indicates that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's review the logic to ensure it aligns with the problem's requirements.\n\nUpon reviewing the conditions, it seems that the constraints are quite strict, and the combination of conditions might indeed lead to no valid solutions. Let's verify the logic:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: At least 6 statements are true.\n2. **Statement 2**: At most 4 statements are false.\n3. **Statement 5**: Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n4. **Statement 6**: The number of true statements is a prime number.\n5. **Statement 7**: The number of false statements is a composite number.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's analyze:\n\n- If there are 6 true statements, then 1 statement is false. However, 1 is not a composite number, so Statement 7 would be false.\n- If there are 7 true statements, then 0 statements are false. However, 0 is not a composite number, so Statement 7 would be false.\n- If there are 5 true statements, then 2 statements are false. However, 2 is not a composite number, so Statement 7 would be false.\n- If there are 4 true statements, then 3 statements are false. However, 3 is not a composite number, so Statement 7 would be false.\n\nGiven these analyses, it seems that the conditions are indeed contradictory, leading to no possible solutions.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
