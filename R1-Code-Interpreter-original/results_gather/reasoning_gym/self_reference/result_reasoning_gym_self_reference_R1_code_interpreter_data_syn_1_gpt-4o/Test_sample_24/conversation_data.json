    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine how many of them can be true simultaneously. Let's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 5 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   - This implies that the number of true statements is 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   - This implies that the number of false statements is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   - This implies that the number of true statements is 5.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   - This implies that the number of false statements is 2.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'  \n   - This implies that either Statement 3 is true or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'  \n   - This implies that the number of true statements is 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'  \n   - This implies that the number of false statements is 4, 6, etc.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If Statement 3 is true, then there are exactly 5 true statements. This satisfies Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 6. Statement 4 must be false, which satisfies Statement 5. The number of false statements is 2, which is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false.\n\n- If Statement 4 is true, then there are exactly 2 false statements. This satisfies Statement 2 and Statement 7. Statement 3 must be false, which satisfies Statement 5. The number of true statements is 5, which satisfies Statement 1 and Statement 6.\n\nWe need to check if there are any other possible combinations of true and false statements that satisfy all conditions. Let's write a Python script to evaluate these conditions and count the number of valid solutions.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import isprime\n\ndef check_statements():\n    solutions = 0\n    for true_count in range(8):  # 0 to 7 true statements\n        false_count = 7 - true_count\n        \n        # Evaluate each statement\n        s1 = true_count >= 5\n        s2 = false_count <= 5\n        s3 = true_count == 5\n        s4 = false_count == 2\n        s5 = (s3 or s4) and not (s3 and s4)\n        s6 = isprime(true_count)\n        s7 = false_count in [4, 6]  # Composite numbers less than 7\n        \n        # Check if the number of true statements matches the count\n        true_statements = sum([s1, s2, s3, s4, s5, s6, s7])\n        \n        if true_statements == true_count:\n            solutions += 1\n    \n    print(solutions)\n\ncheck_statements()\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "The code execution indicates that there are 5 possible solutions where the conditions of the statements are satisfied. \n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<5>>>"
