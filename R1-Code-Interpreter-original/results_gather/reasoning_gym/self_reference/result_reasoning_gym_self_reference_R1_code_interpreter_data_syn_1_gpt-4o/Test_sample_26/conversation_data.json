    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 1 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This implies that not all statements can be false.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means that at least 4 statements must be true.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This is a specific condition that can be true or false.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This is another specific condition that can be true or false.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This is an exclusive OR condition between Statement 3 and Statement 4.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (between 1 and 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (between 0 and 7) are 4, 6, and 8.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If Statement 3 is true, then there are exactly 5 true statements.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then there are exactly 3 true statements.\n- Statement 5 implies that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n\nGiven these conditions, we can write a Python script to check all possible combinations of true and false statements and count the number of valid solutions.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\ndef count_valid_solutions():\n    valid_solutions = 0\n    for true_statements in range(1, 8):\n        false_statements = 7 - true_statements\n        if true_statements >= 4 and is_prime(true_statements) and is_composite(false_statements):\n            if (true_statements == 5 and false_statements == 2) or (true_statements == 3 and false_statements == 4):\n                valid_solutions += 1\n    return valid_solutions\n\nprint(count_valid_solutions())\n```\n\nThis script will check all possible numbers of true statements and verify if they satisfy all the conditions, including the prime and composite requirements, and the exclusive OR condition between Statements 3 and 4. Let's execute the code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "The code output indicates that there are no valid solutions based on the conditions provided. Let's re-evaluate the conditions and logic to ensure everything is correctly implemented.\n\n1. **Statement 1**: At least 1 statement is true.
