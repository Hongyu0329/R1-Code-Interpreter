    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 1 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means that not all statements can be false.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This implies that at least 2 statements are true.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This is a specific condition that can be true or false.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This is another specific condition that can be true or false.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This means that if Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 must be false, and vice versa.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (between 1 and 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (between 0 and 7) are 4, 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If there are 2 true statements, then there are 5 false statements. This satisfies Statement 2, but not Statement 6 (since 2 is prime) and Statement 7 (since 5 is not composite).\n\n- If there are 3 true statements, then there are 4 false statements. This satisfies Statement 2, Statement 6 (since 3 is prime), and Statement 7 (since 4 is composite). However, it contradicts Statement 4 and Statement 5.\n\n- If there are 4 true statements, then there are 3 false statements. This satisfies Statement 2, but not Statement 6 (since 4 is not prime) and Statement 7 (since 3 is not composite).\n\n- If there are 5 true statements, then there are 2 false statements. This satisfies Statement 2, Statement 6 (since 5 is prime), but not Statement 7 (since 2 is not composite).\n\n- If there are 6 true statements, then there is 1 false statement. This satisfies Statement 2, but not Statement 6 (since 6 is not prime) and Statement 7 (since 1 is not composite).\n\n- If there are 7 true statements, then there are 0 false statements. This satisfies Statement 2, Statement 6 (since 7 is prime), but not Statement 7 (since 0 is not composite).\n\nFrom this analysis, the only scenario that satisfies all conditions is when there are 3 true statements and 4 false statements. However, this contradicts Statement 5, which requires either Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be true, but not both.\n\nLet's write a Python script to verify the possible solutions:\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\npossible_solutions = 0\n\nfor true_statements in range(1, 8):\n    false_statements = 7 - true_statements\n    \n    statement_1 = true_statements >= 1\n    statement_2 = false_statements <= 5\n    statement_3 = true_statements == 4\n    statement_4 = false_statements == 3\n    statement_5 = (statement_3 or statement_4) and not (statement_3 and statement_4)\n    statement_6 = is_prime(true_statements)\n    statement_7 = is_composite(false_statements)\n    \n    if (statement_1 and statement_2 and statement_5 and statement_6 and statement_7):\n        possible_solutions += 1\n\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "The code output indicates that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. This means that the set of statements provided is logically inconsistent, and no combination of true and false assignments to the statements can satisfy all the conditions simultaneously.\n\nGiven this result, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
