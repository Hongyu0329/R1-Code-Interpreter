    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine how many of them can be true simultaneously. Let's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This implies that the number of true statements is 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This implies that the number of true statements is 4, 5, 6, or 7 (since 7 - 3 = 4).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This implies that the number of true statements is 2.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This implies that the number of true statements is 0.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This implies that either the number of true statements is 2 or 0, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - This implies that the number of true statements is 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - This implies that the number of false statements is 4, 6, or 8 (since 0 is not composite).\n\nNow, let's find the intersection of these conditions to determine the number of possible solutions. We will use Python to check all possible numbers of true statements (from 0 to 7) and see which ones satisfy all the conditions.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\npossible_solutions = 0\n\nfor true_statements in range(8):\n    false_statements = 7 - true_statements\n    \n    # Check all conditions\n    condition1 = true_statements >= 4\n    condition2 = true_statements >= 4\n    condition3 = true_statements == 2\n    condition4 = true_statements == 0\n    condition5 = (condition3 or condition4) and not (condition3 and condition4)\n    condition6 = is_prime(true_statements)\n    condition7 = is_composite(false_statements)\n    \n    if condition1 and condition2 and condition5 and condition6 and condition7:\n        possible_solutions += 1\n\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "The code output indicates that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's re-evaluate the conditions to ensure they are correctly implemented:\n\n1. **Statement 1** and **Statement 2** both imply that the number of true statements is at least 4.\n2. **Statement 3** and **Statement 4** are mutually exclusive due to **Statement 5**. This means either exactly 2 statements are true or none are true, but not both.\n3. **Statement 6** requires the number of true statements to be a prime number (2, 3, 5, or 7).\n4. **Statement 7** requires the number of false statements to be a composite number (4, 6, or 8).\n\nGiven these conditions, let's re-evaluate the logic:\n\n- If we assume **Statement 3** is true (exactly 2 statements are true), then:\n  - **Statement 1** and **Statement 2** cannot be true because they require at least 4 true statements.\n  - **Statement 6** is satisfied because 2 is a prime number.\n  - **Statement 7** is satisfied because 5 false statements is not a composite number, so this doesn't work.\n\n- If we assume **Statement 4** is true (0 statements are true), then:\n  - This contradicts the requirement for at least 4 true statements from **Statement 1** and **Statement 2**.\n  - **Statement 6** and **Statement 7** are irrelevant because they depend on having some true statements.\n\nGiven these contradictions, it seems there is no consistent way to satisfy all conditions simultaneously. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is indeed 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
