    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means the number of true statements, \\( T \\), must be at least 2.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means the number of false statements, \\( F \\), must be at most 2. Since there are 7 statements in total, \\( T \\geq 5 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 6 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This implies \\( T = 6 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This implies \\( F = 3 \\), which means \\( T = 4 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This means either \\( T = 6 \\) or \\( T = 4 \\), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - The possible prime numbers for \\( T \\) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - The possible composite numbers for \\( F \\) are 4, 6, etc.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values for \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) based on these conditions:\n\n- If \\( T = 6 \\), then \\( F = 1 \\). This satisfies Statement 3, but not Statement 4. Statement 5 is satisfied because only Statement 3 is true. However, Statement 6 is not satisfied because 6 is not a prime number. Statement 7 is not satisfied because 1 is not a composite number.\n\n- If \\( T = 4 \\), then \\( F = 3 \\). This satisfies Statement 4, but not Statement 3. Statement 5 is satisfied because only Statement 4 is true. However, Statement 6 is not satisfied because 4 is not a prime number. Statement 7 is satisfied because 3 is not a composite number.\n\n- If \\( T = 5 \\), then \\( F = 2 \\). This does not satisfy Statement 3 or Statement 4, so Statement 5 is not satisfied. However, Statement 6 is satisfied because 5 is a prime number. Statement 7 is not satisfied because 2 is not a composite number.\n\n- If \\( T = 7 \\), then \\( F = 0 \\). This does not satisfy Statement 3 or Statement 4, so Statement 5 is not satisfied. Statement 6 is satisfied because 7 is a prime number. Statement 7 is not satisfied because 0 is not a composite number.\n\n- If \\( T = 2 \\), then \\( F = 5 \\). This does not satisfy Statement 3 or Statement 4, so Statement 5 is not satisfied. Statement 6 is satisfied because 2 is a prime number. Statement 7 is satisfied because 5 is not a composite number.\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to check these conditions and count the number of possible solutions.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\npossible_solutions = 0\n\nfor T in range(8):\n    F = 7 - T\n    if T >= 2 and F <= 2:  # Statement 1 and 2\n        if (T == 6 and F == 1) or (T == 4 and F == 3):  # Statement 5\n            if is_prime(T) and is_composite(F):  # Statement 6 and 7\n                possible_solutions += 1\n\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "The code output indicates that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's re-evaluate the logic to ensure that all conditions are correctly implemented.\n\nUpon reviewing the conditions, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the statements. Let's re-evaluate the conditions:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.' implies \\( T \\geq 2 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.' implies \\( F \\leq 2 \\), which means \\( T \\geq 5 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 6 of these 7 statements are true.' implies \\( T = 6 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.' implies \\( F = 3 \\), which means \\( T = 4 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.' implies either \\( T = 6 \\) or \\( T = 4 \\), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.' implies \\( T \\) is a prime number.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.' implies \\( F \\) is a composite number.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the possible values for \\( T \\) and \\( F \\):\n\n- If \\( T = 6 \\), then \\( F = 1 \\). This satisfies Statement 3, but not Statement 4. Statement 5 is satisfied because only Statement 3 is true. However, Statement 6 is not satisfied because 6 is not a prime number. Statement 7 is not satisfied because 1 is not a composite number.\n\n- If \\( T = 4 \\), then \\( F = 3 \\). This satisfies Statement 4, but not Statement 3. Statement 5 is satisfied because only Statement 4 is true. However, Statement 6 is not satisfied because 4 is not a prime number. Statement 7 is satisfied because 3 is not a composite number.\n\n- If \\( T = 5 \\), then \\( F = 2 \\). This does not satisfy Statement 3 or Statement 4, so Statement 5 is not satisfied. However, Statement 6 is satisfied because 5 is a prime number. Statement 7 is not satisfied because 2 is not a composite number.\n\n- If \\( T = 7 \\), then \\( F = 0 \\). This does not satisfy Statement 3 or Statement 4, so Statement 5 is not satisfied. Statement 6 is satisfied because 7 is a prime number. Statement 7 is not satisfied because 0 is not a composite number.\n\n- If \\( T = 2 \\), then \\( F = 5 \\). This does not satisfy Statement 3 or Statement 4, so Statement 5 is not satisfied. Statement 6 is satisfied because 2 is a prime number. Statement 7 is satisfied because 5 is not a composite number.\n\nGiven these evaluations, it seems there are no combinations that satisfy all conditions simultaneously. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is indeed 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
