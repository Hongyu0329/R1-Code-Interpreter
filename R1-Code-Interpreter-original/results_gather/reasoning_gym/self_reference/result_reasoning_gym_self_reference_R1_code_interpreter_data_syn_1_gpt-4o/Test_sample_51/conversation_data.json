    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine how many possible solutions exist where these statements can be true or false.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 1 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   - This statement is true unless all statements are false.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   - This means there can be 0, 1, 2, or 3 false statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 6 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   - This implies there is exactly 1 false statement.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   - This implies there are exactly 4 true statements.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'  \n   - This means either Statement 3 is true or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'  \n   - Possible prime numbers for true statements are 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'  \n   - Possible composite numbers for false statements are 4 or 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If Statement 3 is true, then there are 6 true statements and 1 false statement.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then there are 4 true statements and 3 false statements.\n\nWe need to check these scenarios against the other statements to see which combinations are possible.\n\nLet's write a Python script to evaluate these conditions and find the number of possible solutions.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\npossible_solutions = 0\n\n# Check scenario where Statement 3 is true\ntrue_statements = 6\nfalse_statements = 1\n\nif (true_statements >= 1 and\n    false_statements <= 3 and\n    is_prime(true_statements) and\n    is_composite(false_statements)):\n    possible_solutions += 1\n\n# Check scenario where Statement 4 is true\ntrue_statements = 4\nfalse_statements = 3\n\nif (true_statements >= 1 and\n    false_statements <= 3 and\n    is_prime(true_statements) and\n    is_composite(false_statements)):\n    possible_solutions += 1\n\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nThis code will evaluate the conditions and print the number of possible solutions.",
    "The code output indicates that there are no possible solutions based on the conditions we evaluated. Let's re-evaluate the logic to ensure we have considered all possibilities correctly.\n\n1. **Statement 1**: This is always true unless all statements are false, which is not possible if any statement is true.\n2. **Statement 2**: Limits false statements to 3 or fewer.\n3. **Statement 3**: Implies 6 true statements and 1 false statement.\n4. **Statement 4**: Implies 4 true statements and 3 false statements.\n5. **Statement 5**: Only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true.\n6. **Statement 6**: True statements must be a prime number (2, 3, 5, 7).\n7. **Statement 7**: False statements must be a composite number (4, 6).\n\nLet's re-evaluate the scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1**: If Statement 3 is true, then:\n  - True statements = 6 (which is not a prime number, so this scenario is invalid).\n\n- **Scenario 2**: If Statement 4 is true, then:\n  - True statements = 4 (which is not a prime number, so this scenario is invalid).\n\nGiven these evaluations, it seems there might be no valid configuration where all conditions are satisfied.
