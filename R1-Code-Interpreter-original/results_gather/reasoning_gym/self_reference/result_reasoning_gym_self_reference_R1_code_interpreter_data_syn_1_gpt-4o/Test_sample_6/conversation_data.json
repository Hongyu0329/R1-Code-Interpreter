    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine how many of them can be true simultaneously. Let's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.'\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 6 of these 7 statements are false.'\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.'\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.'\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- **Statement 1** implies that the number of true statements is at least 4.\n- **Statement 2** implies that the number of false statements is at most 6, which means at least 1 statement is true.\n- **Statement 3** implies exactly 4 statements are true.\n- **Statement 4** implies exactly 3 statements are false, which means 4 statements are true.\n- **Statement 5** implies that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This means exactly 4 statements are true.\n- **Statement 6** implies the number of true statements is a prime number. The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n- **Statement 7** implies the number of false statements is a composite number. The composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can see that if exactly 4 statements are true, then:\n\n- Statement 3 is true.\n- Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 5 is true (since Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false).\n- Statement 6 is true (since 4 is not a prime number, this statement is false).\n- Statement 7 is true (since 3 false statements is not a composite number, this statement is false).\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to check the number of possible solutions based on these conditions.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\npossible_solutions = 0\n\nfor true_count in range(1, 8):\n    false_count = 7 - true_count\n    \n    # Check each statement\n    statement_1 = true_count >= 4\n    statement_2 = false_count <= 6\n    statement_3 = true_count == 4\n    statement_4 = false_count == 3\n    statement_5 = (statement_3 or statement_4) and not (statement_3 and statement_4)\n    statement_6 = is_prime(true_count)\n    statement_7 = is_composite(false_count)\n    \n    # Count the number of true statements\n    true_statements = sum([statement_1, statement_2, statement_3, statement_4, statement_5, statement_6, statement_7])\n    \n    # Check if the number of true statements matches the true_count\n    if true_statements == true_count:\n        possible_solutions += 1\n\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "Based on the code execution, the number of possible solutions is 3. This means there are three different configurations of truthfulness among the statements that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\n<<<3>>>"
