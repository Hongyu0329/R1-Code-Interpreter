    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means the number of true statements (T) is 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 0 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This implies that all statements are true, i.e., T = 7.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means T = 7.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means T = 4.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This means either T = 7 or T = 4, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - Possible prime numbers for T are 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - The number of false statements (F) is 7 - T, and it should be a composite number.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values of T:\n\n- If T = 7:\n  - Satisfies Statement 2 and Statement 3.\n  - Statement 4 is false, so Statement 5 is true.\n  - Satisfies Statement 6 (7 is prime).\n  - F = 0, which is not composite, so Statement 7 is false.\n  - This configuration is not possible because it contradicts Statement 7.\n\n- If T = 6:\n  - Contradicts Statement 2 and Statement 3.\n  - F = 1, which is not composite, so Statement 7 is false.\n  - This configuration is not possible.\n\n- If T = 5:\n  - Contradicts Statement 2 and Statement 3.\n  - F = 2, which is not composite, so Statement 7 is false.\n  - This configuration is not possible.\n\n- If T = 4:\n  - Satisfies Statement 1 and Statement 4.\n  - Statement 3 is false, so Statement 5 is true.\n  - Does not satisfy Statement 6 (4 is not prime).\n  - F = 3, which is not composite, so Statement 7 is false.\n  - This configuration is not possible.\n\n- If T = 3:\n  - Contradicts Statement 2 and Statement 3.\n  - F = 4, which is composite, so Statement 7 is true.\n  - Does not satisfy Statement 6 (3 is prime).\n  - This configuration is not possible.\n\n- If T = 2:\n  - Contradicts Statement 2 and Statement 3.\n  - F = 5, which is not composite, so Statement 7 is false.\n  - This configuration is not possible.\n\n- If T = 1:\n  - Contradicts Statement 2 and Statement 3.\n  - F = 6, which is composite, so Statement 7 is true.\n  - Does not satisfy Statement 6 (1 is not prime).\n  - This configuration is not possible.\n\n- If T = 0:\n  - Contradicts Statement 2 and Statement 3.\n  - F = 7, which is not composite, so Statement 7 is false.\n  - This configuration is not possible.\n\nAfter analyzing all possible values of T, we find that there are no configurations that satisfy all the statements. Therefore, there are no possible solutions.\n\n<<<0>>>"

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
