    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine how many consistent solutions exist. Let's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.'\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.'\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.'\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 6 of these 7 statements are false.'\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n\nLet's analyze these statements:\n\n- **Statement 1** implies that there are at least 4 true statements.\n- **Statement 2** implies that there are at most 2 false statements, which means there are at least 5 true statements.\n- **Statement 3** implies exactly 5 true statements.\n- **Statement 4** implies exactly 6 false statements, which contradicts Statement 2.\n- **Statement 5** implies that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n- **Statement 6** implies the number of true statements is a prime number (2, 3, 5, 7).\n- **Statement 7** implies the number of false statements is a composite number (4, 6).\n\nFrom Statements 1 and 2, we know there are at least 5 true statements. Statement 3 also suggests exactly 5 true statements, which aligns with this. Statement 4 contradicts the possibility of having 5 true statements, so it must be false. Statement 5 supports this because it allows only one of Statements 3 or 4 to be true, and since Statement 3 is consistent, Statement 4 must be false.\n\nNow, let's check the consistency of the remaining statements:\n\n- If there are 5 true statements, then Statements 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 can be true.\n- Statement 6 is true because 5 is a prime number.\n- Statement 7 would be false because 2 false statements is not a composite number.\n\nLet's verify this with a code to ensure all conditions are met:\n\n```python\ndef check_statements():\n    # Possible number of true statements\n    for true_count in range(8):\n        false_count = 7 - true_count\n        \n        # Check each statement\n        s1 = true_count >= 4\n        s2 = false_count <= 2\n        s3 = true_count == 5\n        s4 = false_count == 6\n        s5 = (s3 or s4) and not (s3 and s4)\n        s6 = true_count in [2, 3, 5, 7]  # Prime numbers\n        s7 = false_count in [4, 6]  # Composite numbers\n        \n        # Count the number of true statements\n        true_statements = sum([s1, s2, s3, s4, s5, s6, s7])\n        \n        # Check if the configuration is consistent\n        if true_statements == true_count:\n            print(f\"Consistent solution found with {true_count} true statements and {false_count} false statements.\")\n\ncheck_statements()\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the number of consistent solutions.",
    "The code output indicates that there are two consistent solutions:\n\n1. All statements are false (0 true statements and 7 false statements).\n2. Five statements are true, and two are false (5 true statements and 2 false statements).\n\nGiven the problem constraints and the analysis, the number of possible solutions is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
