    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 5 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This implies that the number of true statements (T) is 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 6 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This implies that the number of false statements (F) is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This implies T = 5.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This implies F = 2.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This implies that either T = 5 or F = 2, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - This implies T is a prime number (2, 3, 5, 7).\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - This implies F is a composite number (4, 6).\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values for T and F:\n\n- If T = 5, then F = 2. This satisfies Statements 3, 4, and 5, but not Statement 7 (since 2 is not composite).\n- If T = 6, then F = 1. This satisfies Statement 1, but not Statement 7 (since 1 is not composite).\n- If T = 7, then F = 0. This satisfies Statement 1, but not Statement 7 (since 0 is not composite).\n\nLet's write a Python script to check all possible combinations of true and false statements and count the number of solutions that satisfy all conditions.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\npossible_solutions = 0\n\nfor T in range(8):  # T can be from 0 to 7\n    F = 7 - T\n    if (T >= 5 and F <= 6 and\n        ((T == 5) != (F == 2)) and\n        is_prime(T) and\n        is_composite(F)):\n        possible_solutions += 1\n\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nThe code will determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code output indicates that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements. Let's review the logic to ensure everything is correct:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: At least 5 statements are true, so T must be 5, 6, or 7.\n2. **Statement 2**: At most 6 statements are false, so F must be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.\n3. **Statement 3**: Exactly 5 statements are true, so T = 5.\n4. **Statement 4**: Exactly 2 statements are false, so F = 2.\n5. **Statement 5**: Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both, so either T = 5 or F = 2, but not both.\n6. **Statement 6**: The number of true statements is a prime number, so T must be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n7. **Statement 7**: The number of false statements is a composite number, so F must be 4 or 6.\n\nGiven these conditions, let's re-evaluate the possible values for T and F:\n\n- If T = 5, then F = 2. This satisfies Statements 3 and 4, but violates Statement 5.\n- If T = 6, then F = 1. This satisfies Statement 1, but violates Statement 7.\n- If T = 7, then F = 0. This satisfies Statement 1, but violates Statement 7.\n\nIt seems that the conditions are mutually exclusive, leading to no possible solutions. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is indeed 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
