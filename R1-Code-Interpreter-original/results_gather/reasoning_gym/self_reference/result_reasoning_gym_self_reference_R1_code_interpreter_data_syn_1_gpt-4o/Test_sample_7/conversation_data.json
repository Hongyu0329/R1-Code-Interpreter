    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - If this statement is true, then there are 6 or 7 true statements.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 0 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - If this statement is true, then all statements are true.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - If this statement is true, then there are exactly 2 true statements.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - If this statement is true, then there are exactly 6 true statements.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This is a XOR condition between Statement 3 and Statement 4.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (from 0 to 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (from 0 to 7) are 4, 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If Statement 1 is true, then there are 6 or 7 true statements.\n- If Statement 2 is true, then all statements are true, which contradicts Statement 3 and Statement 5.\n- If Statement 3 is true, then there are exactly 2 true statements, which contradicts Statement 1 and Statement 4.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then there are exactly 6 true statements, which is consistent with Statement 1.\n- If Statement 5 is true, then either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n- If Statement 6 is true, the number of true statements must be a prime number.\n- If Statement 7 is true, the number of false statements must be a composite number.\n\nLet's use Python to check the consistency of these statements and find the number of possible solutions.\n\n```python\ndef check_statements():\n    possible_solutions = 0\n    for true_count in range(8):\n        false_count = 7 - true_count\n        \n        # Check each statement\n        s1 = (true_count >= 6)\n        s2 = (false_count <= 0)\n        s3 = (true_count == 2)\n        s4 = (false_count == 1)\n        s5 = (s3 != s4)\n        s6 = (true_count in [2, 3, 5, 7])\n        s7 = (false_count in [4, 6])\n        \n        # Check if the configuration is consistent\n        if (s1 + s2 + s3 + s4 + s5 + s6 + s7) == true_count:\n            possible_solutions += 1\n    \n    return possible_solutions\n\nprint(check_statements())\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "The code execution indicates that there are 2 possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. \n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
