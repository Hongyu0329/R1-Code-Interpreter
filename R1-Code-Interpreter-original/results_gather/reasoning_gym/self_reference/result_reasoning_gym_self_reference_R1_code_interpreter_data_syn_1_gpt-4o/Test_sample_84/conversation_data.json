    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine how many of them can be true simultaneously. Let's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.'\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.'\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.'\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.'\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n\nLet's analyze the constraints:\n\n- If Statement 1 is true, then at least 3 statements are true.\n- If Statement 2 is true, then at most 3 statements are false, meaning at least 4 statements are true.\n- If Statement 3 is true, then exactly 4 statements are true.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then exactly 3 statements are false, meaning 4 statements are true.\n- Statement 5 indicates that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n- Statement 6 requires the number of true statements to be a prime number (2, 3, 5, 7).\n- Statement 7 requires the number of false statements to be a composite number (4, 6).\n\nFrom these constraints, we can deduce:\n\n- If 4 statements are true, then 3 statements are false. This satisfies both Statement 3 and Statement 4, but Statement 5 says only one of them can be true.\n- If 5 statements are true, then 2 statements are false. This satisfies Statement 6 (5 is prime) but not Statement 7 (2 is not composite).\n- If 3 statements are true, then 4 statements are false. This satisfies Statement 7 (4 is composite) but not Statement 6 (3 is prime).\n\nLet's write a Python script to check all possible combinations of true and false statements to find the number of valid solutions.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Statements\nstatements = [\n    lambda t, f: t >= 3,  # Statement 1\n    lambda t, f: f <= 3,  # Statement 2\n    lambda t, f: t == 4,  # Statement 3\n    lambda t, f: f == 3,  # Statement 4\n    lambda t, f: (t == 4) != (f == 3),  # Statement 5\n    lambda t, f: t in {2, 3, 5, 7},  # Statement 6\n    lambda t, f: f in {4, 6},  # Statement 7\n]\n\n# Check all combinations of true/false statements\nvalid_solutions = 0\nfor true_statements in range(8):  # 0 to 7 true statements\n    false_statements = 7 - true_statements\n    if all(statement(true_statements, false_statements) for statement in statements):\n        valid_solutions += 1\n\nprint(valid_solutions)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "The code output indicates that there are no valid solutions based on the constraints provided by the statements. This suggests that the conditions set by the statements are contradictory, and no combination of true and false statements satisfies all the conditions simultaneously.\n\nLet's review the constraints again:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: At least 3 statements are true.\n2. **Statement 2**: At most 3 statements are false, meaning at least 4 statements are true.\n3. **Statement 3**: Exactly 4 statements are true.\n4. **Statement 4**: Exactly 3 statements are false, meaning 4 statements are true.\n5. **Statement 5**: Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n6. **Statement 6**: The number of true statements is a prime number (2, 3, 5, 7).\n7. **Statement 7**: The number of false statements is a composite number (4, 6).\n\nGiven these constraints, let's analyze:\n\n- If 4 statements are true, then Statements 3 and 4 are both satisfied, which contradicts Statement 5.\n- If 5 statements are true, then Statement 6 is satisfied, but Statement 7 is not because 2 false statements are not composite.\n- If 3 statements are true, then Statement 7 is satisfied, but Statement 6 is not because 4 false statements are not prime.\n\nThe constraints are indeed contradictory, and no valid solution exists where all statements can be satisfied simultaneously.\n\n<<<0>>>"
