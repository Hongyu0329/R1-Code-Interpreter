    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 5 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This implies that the number of true statements (T) is 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 4 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This implies that the number of false statements (F) is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This implies T = 1.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This implies F = 5.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This implies that either T = 1 or F = 5, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - This implies T is a prime number (2, 3, 5, or 7).\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - This implies F is a composite number (4, 6).\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If T = 1 (from Statement 3), then F = 6, which contradicts Statement 2 and Statement 4.\n- If F = 5 (from Statement 4), then T = 2, which contradicts Statement 1 and Statement 3.\n- If T = 5, then F = 2, which satisfies Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 6, and Statement 7.\n- If T = 6, then F = 1, which satisfies Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 6, but contradicts Statement 7.\n- If T = 7, then F = 0, which satisfies Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 6, but contradicts Statement 7.\n\nFrom the above analysis, the only scenario that satisfies all the conditions is T = 5 and F = 2. Let's verify this scenario:\n\n- Statement 1: True (5 is at least 5)\n- Statement 2: True (2 is at most 4)\n- Statement 3: False (5 is not exactly 1)\n- Statement 4: False (2 is not exactly 5)\n- Statement 5: True (since both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, this statement is true)\n- Statement 6: True (5 is a prime number)\n- Statement 7: True (2 is not a composite number, but this statement is false, which is consistent with the scenario)\n\nThus, the only possible solution is when T = 5 and F = 2.\n\nLet's confirm this with a Python script to ensure all conditions are met:\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\n# Check all possible values of T (number of true statements)\npossible_solutions = 0\nfor T in range(8):\n    F = 7 - T\n    if (T >= 5 and F <= 4 and\n        (T == 1 or F == 5) and\n        is_prime(T) and\n        is_composite(F)):\n        possible_solutions += 1\n\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "The code output indicates that there are no possible solutions, which suggests an error in the logic or conditions being checked. Let's re-evaluate the conditions and correct the logic:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: T >= 5\n2. **Statement 2**: F <= 4\n3. **Statement 3**: T == 1\n4. **Statement 4**: F == 5\n5. **Statement 5**: (T == 1 or F == 5) and not (T == 1 and F == 5)\n6. **Statement 6**: T is a prime number\n7. **Statement 7**: F is a composite number\n\nThe error in the code is in the condition for Statement 5. It should be checking for the exclusive or condition correctly. Let's fix this and re-run the code:\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\n# Check all possible values of T (number of true statements)\npossible_solutions = 0\nfor T in range(8):\n    F = 7 - T\n    if (T >= 5 and F <= 4 and\n        ((T == 1) != (F == 5)) and\n        is_prime(T) and\n        is_composite(F)):\n        possible_solutions += 1\n\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nLet's execute the corrected code to find the number of possible solutions.",
