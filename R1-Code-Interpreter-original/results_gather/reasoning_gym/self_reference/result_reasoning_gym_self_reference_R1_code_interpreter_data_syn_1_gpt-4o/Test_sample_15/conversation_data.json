    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means the number of true statements (T) is at least 2.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means the number of false statements (F) is at most 3, or equivalently, T ≥ 4.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means T = 5.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means F = 2, or equivalently, T = 5.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This means either T = 5 (from Statement 3) or T = 5 (from Statement 4), but not both. However, since both statements imply T = 5, this condition is always satisfied if T = 5.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - This means T must be a prime number. The prime numbers between 1 and 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - This means F must be a composite number. The composite numbers between 1 and 7 are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values of T and F:\n\n- If T = 5, then F = 2. This satisfies Statement 4, and since T = 5 is a prime number, it satisfies Statement 6. F = 2 is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false.\n\n- If T = 4, then F = 3. This does not satisfy Statement 3 or 4, and T = 4 is not a prime number, so Statement 6 is false. F = 3 is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false.\n\n- If T = 3, then F = 4. This does not satisfy Statement 3 or 4, but T = 3 is a prime number, so Statement 6 is true. F = 4 is a composite number, so Statement 7 is true.\n\n- If T = 2, then F = 5. This does not satisfy Statement 3 or 4, and T = 2 is a prime number, so Statement 6 is true. F = 5 is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false.\n\n- If T = 7, then F = 0. This does not satisfy Statement 3 or 4, and T = 7 is a prime number, so Statement 6 is true. F = 0 is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false.\n\nFrom this analysis, we can see that the only consistent solution is when T = 3 and F = 4, which satisfies all the conditions of the statements.\n\nLet's verify this with a Python script to ensure our reasoning is correct.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\npossible_solutions = 0\n\nfor T in range(8):\n    F = 7 - T\n    if T >= 2 and T >= 4 and (T == 5 or F == 2) and is_prime(T) and is_composite(F):\n        possible_solutions += 1\n\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nThe code will calculate the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's execute it to find the answer.",
    "The code output indicates that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. This suggests that there might be a logical inconsistency in the problem as stated, or I might have made an error in my reasoning.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the conditions:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: T ≥ 2\n2. **Statement 2**: T ≥ 4\n3. **Statement 3**: T = 5\n4. **Statement 4**: T = 5\n5. **Statement 5**: Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. However, both imply T = 5, so this condition is always satisfied if T = 5.\n6. **Statement 6**: T is a prime number (2, 3, 5, 7)\n7. **Statement 7**: F is a composite number (4, 6)\n\nThe key issue is with Statement 5, which seems to be inherently contradictory because both Statements 3 and 4 imply T = 5, making it impossible for one to be true and the other false.\n\nGiven this contradiction, let's reconsider the possible values of T and F:\n\n- If T = 5, then F = 2. This satisfies Statements 3 and 4, but not Statement 7.\n- If T = 3, then F = 4. This satisfies Statement 6 and 7, but not Statements 3 or 4.\n\nThe contradiction in Statement 5 makes it impossible to satisfy all conditions simultaneously. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is indeed 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
