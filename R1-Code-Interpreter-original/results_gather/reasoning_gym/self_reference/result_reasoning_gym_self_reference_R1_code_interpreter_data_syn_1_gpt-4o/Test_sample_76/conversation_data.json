    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.'\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.'\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.'\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are false.'\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Statement 1** implies that there are at least 2 true statements.\n- **Statement 2** implies that there are at most 2 false statements, which means there are at least 5 true statements.\n- **Statement 3** implies there are exactly 4 true statements.\n- **Statement 4** implies there is exactly 1 false statement, which means there are 6 true statements.\n- **Statement 5** implies that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n- **Statement 6** implies the number of true statements is a prime number (2, 3, 5, 7).\n- **Statement 7** implies the number of false statements is a composite number (4, 6, 8, etc.).\n\n### Possible Scenarios:\n\n1. **If Statement 3 is true**: \n   - There are exactly 4 true statements.\n   - This contradicts Statement 2 (at most 2 false statements) and Statement 4 (exactly 1 false statement).\n   - Therefore, Statement 3 cannot be true.\n\n2. **If Statement 4 is true**:\n   - There is exactly 1 false statement, meaning 6 true statements.\n   - This satisfies Statement 2 (at most 2 false statements).\n   - The number of true statements (6) is not a prime number, contradicting Statement 6.\n   - Therefore, Statement 4 cannot be true.\n\n3. **If neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true**:\n   - Statement 5 is false.\n   - We need to check if other statements can be true.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- Since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 can be true, Statement 5 is false.\n- We need to find a configuration where the number of true statements is a prime number and the number of false statements is a composite number.\n\nLet's write a Python script to check the possible configurations:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import isprime\n\ndef check_statements():\n    possible_solutions = 0\n    for true_count in range(2, 8):  # At least 2 true statements\n        false_count = 7 - true_count\n        if true_count >= 5 and isprime(true_count) and false_count in [4, 6, 8]:\n            possible_solutions += 1\n    print(possible_solutions)\n\ncheck_statements()\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions. Let's execute it.",
    "The code output indicates that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.
