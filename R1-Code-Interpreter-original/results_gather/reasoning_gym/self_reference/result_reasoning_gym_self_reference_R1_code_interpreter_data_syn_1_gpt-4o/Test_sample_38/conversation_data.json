    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine how many of them can be true simultaneously. Let's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means the number of true statements (T) is 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means the number of false statements (F) is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means T = 4.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means F = 3.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This means either T = 4 or F = 3, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - This means T is a prime number (2, 3, 5, or 7).\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - This means F is a composite number (4, 6).\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible combinations of true and false statements:\n\n- If T = 4, then F = 3. This satisfies Statement 3, Statement 4, and Statement 5 (since only one of Statement 3 or 4 can be true). However, T = 4 is not a prime number, so Statement 6 is false. F = 3 is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false. This combination does not satisfy all conditions.\n\n- If T = 5, then F = 2. This satisfies Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 6 (since 5 is a prime number). Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, and Statement 5 is true (since neither Statement 3 nor 4 is true). F = 2 is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false. This combination satisfies most conditions.\n\n- If T = 6, then F = 1. This satisfies Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 6 (since 6 is not a prime number, so Statement 6 is false). Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, and Statement 5 is true (since neither Statement 3 nor 4 is true). F = 1 is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false. This combination does not satisfy all conditions.\n\n- If T = 7, then F = 0. This satisfies Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 6 (since 7 is a prime number). Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, and Statement 5 is true (since neither Statement 3 nor 4 is true). F = 0 is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false. This combination satisfies most conditions.\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to check these conditions and find the number of possible solutions.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\npossible_solutions = 0\n\nfor T in range(8):\n    F = 7 - T\n    if (T >= 4 and F <= 5 and\n        ((T == 4) != (F == 3)) and\n        is_prime(T) and\n        is_composite(F)):\n        possible_solutions += 1\n\nprint(possible_solutions)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "The code output indicates that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's re-evaluate the conditions and ensure that the logic is correctly implemented.\n\nUpon reviewing the conditions, it seems that the constraints are quite strict, and the combination of conditions might indeed lead to no valid solutions. Let's verify the logic:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: T ≥ 4\n2. **Statement 2**: F ≤ 5\n3. **Statement 3**: T = 4\n4. **Statement 4**: F = 3\n5. **Statement 5**: (T = 4) XOR (F = 3)\n6. **Statement 6**: T is prime\n7. **Statement 7**: F is composite\n\nThe XOR condition in Statement 5 means that either T = 4 or F = 3, but not both. This is a critical condition that might be causing the issue. Let's re-evaluate the possible values of T and F:\n\n- If T = 4, then F = 3. This satisfies Statement 3 and Statement 4, but violates the XOR condition in Statement 5.\n- If T = 5, then F = 2. This satisfies Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 6, but F = 2 is not composite, violating Statement 7.\n- If T = 6, then F = 1. This satisfies Statement 1 and Statement 2, but T = 6 is not prime, violating Statement 6.\n- If T = 7, then F = 0. This satisfies Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 6, but F = 0 is not composite, violating Statement 7.\n\nGiven these evaluations, it seems that the constraints are indeed too strict to allow for any valid solutions. Therefore, the output of 0 possible solutions is correct.\n\n<<<0>>>"
