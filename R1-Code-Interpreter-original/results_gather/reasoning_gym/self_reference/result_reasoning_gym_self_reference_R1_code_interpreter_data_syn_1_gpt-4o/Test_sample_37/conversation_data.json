    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\nLet's break down each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 1 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This implies that not all statements can be false.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means that at least 4 statements must be true.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This is a specific condition that can be true or false.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This is another specific condition that can be true or false.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This is an exclusive OR condition between Statement 3 and Statement 4.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (given the constraints) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (given the constraints) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If exactly 4 statements are true (Statement 3 is true), then 3 statements are false. This satisfies Statement 4, which contradicts Statement 5. Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\n- If exactly 3 statements are false (Statement 4 is true), then 4 statements are true. This satisfies Statement 3, which contradicts Statement 5. Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\n- If exactly 5 statements are true, then 2 statements are false. This satisfies Statement 6 (since 5 is prime) but does not satisfy Statement 7 (since 2 is not composite).\n\n- If exactly 6 statements are true, then 1 statement is false. This does not satisfy Statement 6 (since 6 is not prime) and does not satisfy Statement 7 (since 1 is not composite).\n\n- If exactly 7 statements are true, then 0 statements are false. This satisfies Statement 6 (since 7 is prime) but does not satisfy Statement 7 (since 0 is not composite).\n\nGiven these analyses, let's write a Python script to check the possible number of solutions that satisfy all conditions.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import isprime\n\ndef check_statements():\n    possible_solutions = 0\n    for true_count in range(1, 8):\n        false_count = 7 - true_count\n        # Check conditions\n        if (true_count >= 4 and\n            (true_count == 4 or true_count == 3) and\n            (true_count == 4) != (false_count == 3) and\n            isprime(true_count) and\n            false_count in [4, 6]):\n            possible_solutions += 1\n    print(possible_solutions)\n\ncheck_statements()\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the number of possible solutions.",
    "The code output indicates that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's re-evaluate the conditions and ensure that the logic is correctly implemented.\n\nUpon reviewing the conditions, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the logic applied to the statements. Let's re-evaluate the conditions:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: At least 1 statement is true.\n2. **Statement 2**: At most 3 statements are false, meaning at least 4 statements are true.\n3. **Statement 3**: Exactly 4 statements are true.\n4. **Statement 4**: Exactly 3 statements are false.\n5. **Statement 5**: Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n6. **Statement 6**: The number of true statements is a prime number.\n7. **Statement 7**: The number of false statements is a composite number.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the possible scenarios:\n\n- If exactly 4 statements are true, then 3 statements are false. This satisfies both Statement 3 and Statement 4, which contradicts Statement 5. Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\n- If exactly 5 statements are true, then 2 statements are false. This satisfies Statement 6 (since 5 is prime) but does not satisfy Statement 7 (since 2 is not composite).\n\n- If exactly 6 statements are true, then 1 statement is false. This does not satisfy Statement 6 (since 6 is not prime) and does not satisfy Statement 7 (since 1 is not composite).\n\n- If exactly 7 statements are true, then 0 statements are false. This satisfies Statement 6 (since 7 is prime) but does not satisfy Statement 7 (since 0 is not composite).\n\nGiven these analyses, it seems that there are indeed no possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions simultaneously. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
