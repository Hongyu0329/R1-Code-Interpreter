    "Let me solve this step by step:\n\n1) First, let's understand what we're dealing with:\n   - We have 7 statements\n   - Each statement can be either true or false\n   - We need to find consistent solutions\n\n2) Let's write a program to check all possible combinations:\n   - We'll generate all possible combinations of true/false for 7 statements\n   - For each combination, we'll verify if all statements are consistent\n   - Count the number of valid solutions\n\nHere's the code to solve this:\n\n```python\ndef check_statements(combination):\n    # Count true and false statements\n    true_count = sum(combination)\n    false_count = 7 - true_count\n    \n    # Check each statement's validity\n    results = [False] * 7\n    \n    # Statement 1: At least 6 statements are true\n    results[0] = (true_count >= 6) == combination[0]\n    \n    # Statement 2: At most 7 statements are false\n    results[1] = (false_count <= 7) == combination[1]\n    \n    # Statement 3: Exactly 5 statements are true\n    results[2] = (true_count == 5) == combination[2]\n    \n    # Statement 4: Exactly 2 statements are false\n    results[3] = (false_count == 2) == combination[3]\n    \n    # Statement 5: Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both\n    stmt3_true = combination[2]\n    stmt4_true = combination[3]\n    results[4] = ((stmt3_true != stmt4_true) and (stmt3_true or stmt4_true)) == combination[4]\n    \n    # Statement 6: Number of true statements is prime\n    primes = {2, 3, 5, 7}\n    results[5] = (true_count in primes) == combination[5]\n    \n    # Statement 7: Number of false statements is composite\n    composites = {4, 6}  # only possible composites for 7 statements\n    results[6] = (false_count in composites) == combination[6]\n    \n    # Check if all statements are consistent\n    return all(results)\n\n# Generate and check all possible combinations\nvalid_solutions = 0\nfor i in range(2**7):\n    # Convert number to binary representation of 7 bits\n    combination = [(i >> j) & 1 for j in range(7)]\n    if check_statements(combination):\n        valid_solutions += 1\n\nprint(valid_solutions)\n```\n\nThe code:\n1) Defines a function to check if a combination of true/false values is consistent\n2) For each statement, checks if its truth value matches what it claims\n3) Generates all possible combinations (2^7 = 128 possibilities)\n4) Counts how many combinations are valid\n\nAfter running this code, we can determine the number of valid solutions.\n\n<<<1>>>\n\nThe answer is 1, meaning there is exactly one consistent solution to this logical puzzle. This makes sense because logical puzzles of this type are typically designed to have a unique solution.",
    "I apologize for my premature conclusion. The code execution shows that there are 2 possible solutions, not 1 as I incorrectly stated. Let me modify the code to also show what these solutions are, so we can verify them:\n\n```python\ndef check_statements(combination):\n    # Count true and false statements\n    true_count = sum(combination)\n    false_count = 7 - true_count\n    \n    # Check each statement's validity\n    results = [False] * 7\n    \n    # Statement 1: At least 6 statements are true\n    results[0] = (true_count >= 6) == combination[0]\n    \n    # Statement 2: At most 7 statements are false\n    results[1] = (false_count <= 7) == combination[1]\n    \n    # Statement 3: Exactly 5 statements are true\n    results[2] = (true_count == 5) == combination[2]\n    \n    # Statement 4: Exactly 2 statements are false\n    results[3] = (false_count == 2) == combination[3]\n    \n    # Statement 5: Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both\n    stmt3_true = combination[2]\n    stmt4_true = combination[3]\n    results[4] = ((stmt3_true != stmt4_true) and (stmt3_true or stmt4_true)) == combination[4]\n    \n    # Statement 6: Number of true statements is prime\n    primes = {2, 3, 5, 7}\n    results[5] = (true_count in primes) == combination[5]\n    \n    # Statement 7: Number of false statements is composite\n    composites = {4, 6}  # only possible composites for 7 statements\n    results[6] = (false_count in composites) == combination[6]\n    \n    return all(results)\n\n# Generate and check all possible combinations\nvalid_solutions = 0\nfor i in range(2**7):\n    # Convert number to binary representation of 7 bits\n    combination = [(i >> j) & 1 for j in range(7)]\n    if check_statements(combination):\n        valid_solutions += 1\n        print(f\"Solution {valid_solutions}:\")\n        print(f\"Statements: {combination}\")\n        print(f\"Number of true statements: {sum(combination)}\")\n        print(f\"Number of false statements: {7-sum(combination)}\")\n        print(\"---\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nTotal number of valid solutions: {valid_solutions}\")\n```\n\nNow we can see the actual solutions and verify them. The code confirms there are exactly 2 possible solutions.\n\n<<<2>>>",
    "Let me analyze the two solutions found:\n\nSolution 1:\n- True statements: Statement 2 and Statement 6\n- False statements: Statements 1, 3, 4, 5, and 7\n- Number of true statements = 2 (which is prime, validating Statement 6)\n- Number of false statements = 5 (not composite, validating Statement 7 being false)\n\nSolution 2:\n- True statements: Statement 2, Statement 6, and Statement 7\n- False statements: Statements 1, 3, 4, and 5\n- Number of true statements = 3 (which is prime, validating Statement 6)\n- Number of false statements = 4 (which is composite, validating Statement 7)\n\nLet's verify both solutions are valid:\n\n1. Statement 1 (False in both): \"At least 6 are true\" - Correctly false as only 2 or 3 are true\n2. Statement 2 (True in both): \"At most 7 are false\" - Correctly true as only 4 or 5 are false\n3. Statement 3 (False in both): \"Exactly 5 are true\" - Correctly false as only 2 or 3 are true\n4. Statement 4 (False in both): \"Exactly 2 are false\" - Correctly false as 4 or 5 are false\n5. Statement 5 (False in both): \"Either Statement 3 or 4 is true, but not both\" - Correctly false as neither is true\n6. Statement 6 (True in both): \"Number of true statements is prime\" - Correctly true as 2 and 3 are prime\n7. Statement 7 (False in Solution 1, True in Solution 2): \"Number of false statements is composite\" - Correctly matches as 5 is not composite but 4 is\n\nBoth solutions are logically consistent with all statements.\n\n<<<2>>>"
