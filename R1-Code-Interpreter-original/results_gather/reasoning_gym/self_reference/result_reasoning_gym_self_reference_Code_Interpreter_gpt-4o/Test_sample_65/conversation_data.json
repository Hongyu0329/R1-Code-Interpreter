    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the truth values of the 7 statements and find the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nLet's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 5 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means there are 5, 6, or 7 true statements.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 0 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means there are 0 false statements, i.e., all 7 statements are true.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means there are 5 true statements.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means there are 5 false statements.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either Statement 3 is true (5 true statements) or Statement 4 is true (5 false statements), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the possible scenarios:\n\n- If Statement 2 is true, then all statements are true, which contradicts Statement 4. Therefore, Statement 2 must be false.\n- If Statement 1 is true, then there are at least 5 true statements.\n- If Statement 3 is true, then there are exactly 5 true statements.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then there are exactly 5 false statements.\n- If Statement 5 is true, then either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n- If Statement 6 is true, then the number of true statements is a prime number.\n- If Statement 7 is true, then the number of false statements is a composite number.\n\nLet's evaluate the possible number of true statements and check which scenario satisfies all conditions.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the possible number of true statements and check each scenario\npossible_true_counts = range(8)  # 0 to 7 true statements\nsolutions = []\n\nfor true_count in possible_true_counts:\n    false_count = 7 - true_count\n    \n    # Evaluate each statement\n    statement_1 = (true_count >= 5)\n    statement_2 = (false_count <= 0)\n    statement_3 = (true_count == 5)\n    statement_4 = (false_count == 5)\n    statement_5 = (statement_3 != statement_4)\n    statement_6 = (true_count in [2, 3, 5, 7])  # Prime numbers\n    statement_7 = (false_count in [4, 6])  # Composite numbers\n    \n    # Check if all conditions are satisfied\n    if (statement_1 and not statement_2 and statement_5 and statement_6 and statement_7):\n        solutions.append(true_count)\n\nlen(solutions)\nassistant > It appears that there are no scenarios where all the conditions are satisfied simultaneously. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is: <<<0>>>."
