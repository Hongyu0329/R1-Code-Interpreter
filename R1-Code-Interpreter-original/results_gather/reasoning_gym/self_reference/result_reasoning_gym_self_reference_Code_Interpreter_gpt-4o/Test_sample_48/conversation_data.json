    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the truth values of each statement and check for consistency. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.\"  \n   - This implies all statements are true.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"  \n   - This implies at least 5 statements are true.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true.\"  \n   - This implies 5 statements are false.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are false.\"  \n   - This implies 3 statements are true.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"  \n   - This implies one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"  \n   - Possible prime numbers for true statements are 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"  \n   - Possible composite numbers for false statements are 4, 6, etc.\n\nLet's evaluate the possible scenarios:\n\n- If Statement 1 is true, then all statements are true, which contradicts Statements 3, 4, and 5.\n- If Statement 2 is true, then at least 5 statements are true.\n- If Statement 3 is true, then exactly 2 statements are true, which contradicts Statement 2.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then exactly 4 statements are false, which means 3 statements are true.\n- If Statement 5 is true, then either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n- If Statement 6 is true, the number of true statements is a prime number.\n- If Statement 7 is true, the number of false statements is a composite number.\n\nLet's evaluate the possible number of true statements and check for consistency.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Possible number of true statements\npossible_true_counts = [2, 3, 5, 7]  # Prime numbers\n\n# Check each possible number of true statements for consistency\nsolutions = []\n\nfor true_count in possible_true_counts:\n    false_count = 7 - true_count\n    \n    # Check each statement\n    s1 = (true_count >= 7)\n    s2 = (false_count <= 2)\n    s3 = (true_count == 2)\n    s4 = (false_count == 4)\n    s5 = (s3 != s4)  # Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both\n    s6 = (true_count in [2, 3, 5, 7])  # Prime number\n    s7 = (false_count in [4, 6])  # Composite number\n    \n    # Check if the configuration is consistent\n    if [s1, s2, s3, s4, s5, s6, s7].count(True) == true_count:\n        solutions.append(true_count)\n\nlen(solutions)\nassistant > After evaluating the possible scenarios, it turns out that there are no consistent solutions where the truth values of the statements satisfy all the given conditions.
