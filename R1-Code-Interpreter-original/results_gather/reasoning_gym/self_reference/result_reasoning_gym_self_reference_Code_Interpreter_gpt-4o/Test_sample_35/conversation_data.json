    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements \\( T \\geq 2 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means the number of false statements \\( F \\leq 3 \\), which implies \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means \\( T = 4 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means \\( F = 3 \\), which implies \\( T = 4 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either \\( T = 4 \\) or \\( F = 3 \\), but not both. However, since both imply \\( T = 4 \\), this statement is satisfied if \\( T = 4 \\).\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. So, \\( T \\) could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6. So, \\( F \\) could be 4 or 6.\n\nNow, let's find the number of possible solutions that satisfy all these conditions. We'll check each possible value of \\( T \\) and see if it satisfies all the statements. \n\n- If \\( T = 4 \\), then \\( F = 3 \\). This satisfies all statements because:\n  - Statement 1: \\( T \\geq 2 \\) is true.\n  - Statement 2: \\( F \\leq 3 \\) is true.\n  - Statement 3: \\( T = 4 \\) is true.\n  - Statement 4: \\( F = 3 \\) is true.\n  - Statement 5: Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both, is satisfied because both imply \\( T = 4 \\).\n  - Statement 6: \\( T = 4 \\) is not a prime number, so this is false.\n  - Statement 7: \\( F = 3 \\) is not a composite number, so this is false.\n\nSince Statements 6 and 7 are not satisfied, \\( T = 4 \\) is not a valid solution.\n\nLet's check other possible values of \\( T \\) (2, 3, 5, 7) and see if they satisfy all the statements.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the possible values for T and F\npossible_T_values = [2, 3, 4, 5, 7]\npossible_F_values = [4, 6]\n\n# Initialize a counter for the number of valid solutions\nvalid_solutions = 0\n\n# Check each possible value of T\nfor T in possible_T_values:\n    F = 7 - T  # Calculate the corresponding F\n    # Check if all statements are satisfied\n    if (T >= 2 and  # Statement 1\n        F <= 3 and  # Statement 2\n        ((T == 4) != (F == 3)) and  # Statement 5\n        T in [2, 3, 5, 7] and  # Statement 6\n        F in possible_F_values):  # Statement 7\n        valid_solutions += 1\n\nvalid_solutions\nassistant > After evaluating all possible values for the number of true statements \\( T \\), it turns out that none of the configurations satisfy all the given statements simultaneously. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
