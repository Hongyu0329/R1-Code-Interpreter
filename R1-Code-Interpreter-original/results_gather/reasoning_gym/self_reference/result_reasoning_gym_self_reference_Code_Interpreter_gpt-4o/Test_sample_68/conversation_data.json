    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions where the statements are consistent with each other.\n\nLet's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then there are either 6 or 7 true statements.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then there are either 0 or 1 false statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 6 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then there are exactly 6 true statements.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then there are exactly 2 true statements.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This statement implies that either Statement 3 is true or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The number of true statements must be a prime number (2, 3, 5, 7).\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The number of false statements must be a composite number (4, 6).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the possible scenarios:\n\n- If there are 7 true statements, then all statements are true, which contradicts Statement 4.\n- If there are 6 true statements, then Statement 3 is true, and Statement 4 is false. This satisfies Statement 5.\n- If there are 5 true statements, then Statement 1 is false, which contradicts Statement 2.\n- If there are 4 true statements, then Statement 1 is false, which contradicts Statement 2.\n- If there are 3 true statements, then Statement 1 is false, which contradicts Statement 2.\n- If there are 2 true statements, then Statement 4 is true, and Statement 3 is false. This satisfies Statement 5.\n- If there is 1 true statement, then Statement 1 is false, which contradicts Statement 2.\n\nLet's check the consistency of the scenarios with the prime and composite conditions:\n\n- 6 true statements: 1 false statement (1 is not composite)\n- 2 true statements: 5 false statements (5 is not composite)\n\nLet's evaluate these scenarios to find the number of possible solutions.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the possible scenarios for the number of true statements\nscenarios = {\n    6: {\"true_statements\": 6, \"false_statements\": 1},\n    2: {\"true_statements\": 2, \"false_statements\": 5}\n}\n\n# Check the consistency of each scenario with the prime and composite conditions\nprime_numbers = {2, 3, 5, 7}\ncomposite_numbers = {4, 6}\n\n# Evaluate the scenarios\npossible_solutions = 0\nfor scenario in scenarios.values():\n    true_statements = scenario[\"true_statements\"]\n    false_statements = scenario[\"false_statements\"]\n    \n    # Check if the number of true statements is prime and the number of false statements is composite\n    if true_statements in prime_numbers and false_statements in composite_numbers:\n        possible_solutions += 1\n\npossible_solutions\nassistant > Upon evaluating the scenarios, it turns out that neither scenario satisfies both the prime condition for the number of true statements and the composite condition for the number of false statements. Therefore, there are no possible solutions where all the statements are consistent with each other.\n\nThe number of possible solutions is: <<<0>>>."
