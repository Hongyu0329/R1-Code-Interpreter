    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements \\( T \\) is \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means the number of false statements \\( F \\) is \\( F \\leq 1 \\), which implies \\( T \\geq 6 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means \\( T = 5 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means \\( F = 2 \\), which implies \\( T = 5 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either \\( T = 5 \\) or \\( F = 2 \\), but not both. Since both imply the same condition, this statement is always true if \\( T = 5 \\).\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. So, \\( T \\) could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6. So, \\( F \\) could be 4 or 6.\n\nNow, let's find the number of possible solutions that satisfy all these conditions. We'll check each possible value of \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) to see if they satisfy all the statements.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Possible values for T and F based on the statements\npossible_T_values = [2, 3, 5, 7]  # Prime numbers for T\npossible_F_values = [4, 6]        # Composite numbers for F\n\n# Check each possible value of T and F\npossible_solutions = 0\nfor T in possible_T_values:\n    F = 7 - T  # Since there are 7 statements, F = 7 - T\n    if F in possible_F_values:\n        # Check if all conditions are satisfied\n        if T >= 4 and T >= 6 and T == 5 and F == 2:\n            possible_solutions += 1\n\npossible_solutions\nassistant > Upon evaluating the conditions, it appears there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements simultaneously. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is: <<<0>>>."
