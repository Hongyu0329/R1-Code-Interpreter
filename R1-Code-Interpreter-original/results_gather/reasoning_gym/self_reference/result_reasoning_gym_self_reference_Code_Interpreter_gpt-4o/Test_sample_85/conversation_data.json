    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of true statements among the seven given statements, considering the conditions provided by each statement.\n\nLet's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means the number of false statements \\( F \\leq 5 \\), which implies \\( T \\geq 2 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means \\( T = 4 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means \\( F = 7 \\), which implies \\( T = 0 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either \\( T = 4 \\) or \\( T = 0 \\), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - This means \\( T \\) is a prime number (2, 3, 5, 7).\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - This means \\( F \\) is a composite number (4, 6).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the possible values of \\( T \\) and check which satisfy all the conditions:\n\n- \\( T = 0 \\): \n  - Violates Statement 1 (\\( T \\geq 4 \\)).\n  - Violates Statement 2 (\\( T \\geq 2 \\)).\n  - Violates Statement 5 (since both Statements 3 and 4 cannot be true).\n  - Violates Statement 6 (0 is not a prime number).\n  - Violates Statement 7 (7 is not a composite number).\n\n- \\( T = 2 \\):\n  - Violates Statement 1 (\\( T \\geq 4 \\)).\n  - Satisfies Statement 2 (\\( T \\geq 2 \\)).\n  - Violates Statement 3 (\\( T = 4 \\)).\n  - Violates Statement 4 (\\( T = 0 \\)).\n  - Satisfies Statement 6 (2 is a prime number).\n  - Satisfies Statement 7 (5 is not a composite number).\n\n- \\( T = 3 \\):\n  - Violates Statement 1 (\\( T \\geq 4 \\)).\n  - Satisfies Statement 2 (\\( T \\geq 2 \\)).\n  - Violates Statement 3 (\\( T = 4 \\)).\n  - Violates Statement 4 (\\( T = 0 \\)).\n  - Satisfies Statement 6 (3 is a prime number).\n  - Satisfies Statement 7 (4 is a composite number).\n\n- \\( T = 4 \\):\n  - Satisfies Statement 1 (\\( T \\geq 4 \\)).\n  - Satisfies Statement 2 (\\( T \\geq 2 \\)).\n  - Satisfies Statement 3 (\\( T = 4 \\)).\n  - Violates Statement 4 (\\( T = 0 \\)).\n  - Violates Statement 5 (since both Statements 3 and 4 cannot be true).\n  - Violates Statement 6 (4 is not a prime number).\n  - Satisfies Statement 7 (3 is not a composite number).\n\n- \\( T = 5 \\):\n  - Satisfies Statement 1 (\\( T \\geq 4 \\)).\n  - Satisfies Statement 2 (\\( T \\geq 2 \\)).\n  - Violates Statement 3 (\\( T = 4 \\)).\n  - Violates Statement 4 (\\( T = 0 \\)).\n  - Satisfies Statement 6 (5 is a prime number).\n  - Satisfies Statement 7 (2 is not a composite number).\n\n- \\( T = 6 \\):\n  - Satisfies Statement 1 (\\( T \\geq 4 \\)).\n  - Satisfies Statement 2 (\\( T \\geq 2 \\)).\n  - Violates Statement 3 (\\( T = 4 \\)).\n  - Violates Statement 4 (\\( T = 0 \\)).\n  - Violates Statement 6 (6 is not a prime number).\n  - Satisfies Statement 7 (1 is not a composite number).\n\n- \\( T = 7 \\):\n  - Satisfies Statement 1 (\\( T \\geq 4 \\)).\n  - Violates Statement 2 (\\( T \\geq 2 \\)).\n  - Violates Statement 3 (\\( T = 4 \\)).\n  - Violates Statement 4 (\\( T = 0 \\)).\n  - Satisfies Statement 6 (7 is a prime number).\n  - Violates Statement 7 (0 is not a composite number).\n\nNow, let's count the number of possible solutions that satisfy all conditions.\nassistant > After evaluating each possible value of \\( T \\) (the number of true statements), we find that:\n\n- \\( T = 2 \\) satisfies Statements 2, 6, and 7.\n- \\( T = 3 \\) satisfies Statements 2, 6, and 7.\n- \\( T = 5 \\) satisfies Statements 1, 2, 6, and 7.\n\nThese are the only values of \\( T \\) that satisfy the conditions provided by the statements. Therefore, there are three possible solutions.\n\nThus, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n<<<3>>>\n\\]"
