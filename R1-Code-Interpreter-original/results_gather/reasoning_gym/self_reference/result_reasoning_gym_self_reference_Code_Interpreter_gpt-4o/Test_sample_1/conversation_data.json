    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the truth values of the 7 statements and find the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nLet's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means either 6 or 7 statements are true.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 7 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This is always true because there are only 7 statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means 5 statements are true.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means 5 statements are true.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This means either Statement 3 is true or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the possible scenarios:\n\n- If 6 statements are true, then 1 statement is false.\n- If 5 statements are true, then 2 statements are false.\n- If 7 statements are true, then 0 statements are false.\n\nWe need to check which of these scenarios satisfy all the conditions, especially focusing on the prime and composite number conditions.\n\nLet's evaluate these scenarios: \n\n1. **6 true statements, 1 false statement**:\n   - Number of true statements (6) is not a prime number.\n   - Number of false statements (1) is not a composite number.\n\n2. **5 true statements, 2 false statements**:\n   - Number of true statements (5) is a prime number.\n   - Number of false statements (2) is not a composite number.\n\n3. **7 true statements, 0 false statements**:\n   - Number of true statements (7) is a prime number.\n   - Number of false statements (0) is not a composite number.\n\nFrom the above analysis, none of the scenarios satisfy all the conditions. Therefore, there are no possible solutions.\n\nThe number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
