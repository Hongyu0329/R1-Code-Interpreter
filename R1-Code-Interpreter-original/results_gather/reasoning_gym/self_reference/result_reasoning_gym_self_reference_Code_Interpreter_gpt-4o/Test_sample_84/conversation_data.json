    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of true statements among the seven given statements, considering the conditions provided by each statement.\n\nLet's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means the number of true statements \\( T \\geq 3 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means the number of false statements \\( F \\leq 3 \\), or equivalently, \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means \\( T = 4 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means \\( F = 3 \\), or equivalently, \\( T = 4 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This means either \\( T = 4 \\) (Statement 3 is true) or \\( T = 4 \\) (Statement 4 is true), but not both. However, since both statements imply \\( T = 4 \\), this condition is satisfied if \\( T = 4 \\).\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - This means \\( T \\) is a prime number. The possible prime numbers for \\( T \\) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - This means \\( F \\) is a composite number. The possible composite numbers for \\( F \\) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's find the number of possible solutions by checking the consistency of these conditions. We'll evaluate each possible value of \\( T \\) from 0 to 7 and see which ones satisfy all the conditions.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the possible values for T (number of true statements)\npossible_T_values = range(8)\n\n# Define the conditions for each statement\ndef check_conditions(T):\n    F = 7 - T  # Number of false statements\n    \n    # Check each condition\n    cond1 = (T >= 3)  # Statement 1\n    cond2 = (T >= 4)  # Statement 2\n    cond3 = (T == 4)  # Statement 3\n    cond4 = (T == 4)  # Statement 4\n    cond5 = (cond3 != cond4)  # Statement 5\n    cond6 = (T in [2, 3, 5, 7])  # Statement 6 (T is prime)\n    cond7 = (F in [4, 6])  # Statement 7 (F is composite)\n    \n    # Check if all conditions are satisfied\n    return cond1 and cond2 and cond5 and cond6 and cond7\n\n# Count the number of possible solutions\npossible_solutions = sum(check_conditions(T) for T in possible_T_values)\npossible_solutions\nassistant > Upon evaluating the conditions, it turns out that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements simultaneously. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is: <<<0>>>."
