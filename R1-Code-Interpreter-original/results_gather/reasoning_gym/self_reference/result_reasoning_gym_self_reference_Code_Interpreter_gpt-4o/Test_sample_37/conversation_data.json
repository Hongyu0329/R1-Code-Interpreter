    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\nLet's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 1 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means that not all statements can be false.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means that at least 4 statements must be true.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means that 3 statements are false.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means that 4 statements are true.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This means that either exactly 4 statements are true or exactly 3 statements are false, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (between 1 and 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (between 0 and 6) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the possible scenarios:\n\n- If 4 statements are true, then 3 statements are false. This satisfies Statement 4 and Statement 5.\n- If 3 statements are false, then 4 statements are true. This satisfies Statement 3 and Statement 5.\n- The number of true statements (4) is not a prime number, so Statement 6 is false.\n- The number of false statements (3) is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false.\n\nLet's check if there are any other possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions. We'll evaluate the number of true and false statements for each possible scenario.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Possible number of true statements (1 to 7)\n# We need to check which combinations satisfy all the conditions\n\n# Prime numbers between 1 and 7\nprime_numbers = {2, 3, 5, 7}\n\n# Composite numbers between 0 and 6\ncomposite_numbers = {4, 6}\n\n# Check each possible number of true statements\npossible_solutions = []\n\nfor true_statements in range(1, 8):\n    false_statements = 7 - true_statements\n    \n    # Check conditions\n    condition_1 = true_statements >= 1  # At least 1 statement is true\n    condition_2 = false_statements <= 3  # At most 3 statements are false\n    condition_3 = (true_statements == 4)  # Exactly 4 statements are true\n    condition_4 = (false_statements == 3)  # Exactly 3 statements are false\n    condition_5 = (condition_3 != condition_4)  # Either Statement 3 or 4 is true, but not both\n    condition_6 = (true_statements in prime_numbers)  # Number of true statements is a prime number\n    condition_7 = (false_statements in composite_numbers)  # Number of false statements is a composite number\n    \n    # Check if all conditions are satisfied\n    if (condition_1 and condition_2 and condition_5 and condition_6 and condition_7):\n        possible_solutions.append((true_statements, false_statements))\n\nlen(possible_solutions)\nassistant > It appears that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions simultaneously.
