    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of true statements among the seven given statements. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means the number of false statements \\( F \\leq 5 \\), which implies \\( T \\geq 2 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means \\( T = 0 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means \\( F = 3 \\), which implies \\( T = 4 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either \\( T = 0 \\) or \\( T = 4 \\), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - This means \\( T \\) is a prime number (2, 3, 5, 7).\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - This means \\( F \\) is a composite number (4, 6).\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values of \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) that satisfy all these conditions:\n\n- From Statement 1, \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n- From Statement 2, \\( T \\geq 2 \\).\n- From Statement 5, \\( T = 0 \\) or \\( T = 4 \\).\n- From Statement 6, \\( T \\) is a prime number.\n- From Statement 7, \\( F \\) is a composite number.\n\nLet's evaluate the possible values of \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) that satisfy all these conditions.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Possible values for T (number of true statements) and F (number of false statements)\n# T + F = 7\n\n# Prime numbers less than or equal to 7\nprime_numbers = [2, 3, 5, 7]\n\n# Composite numbers less than or equal to 7\ncomposite_numbers = [4, 6]\n\n# Possible values for T and F\npossible_solutions = []\n\n# Check each possible value of T\nfor T in range(8):\n    F = 7 - T\n    # Check all conditions\n    if (T >= 4 and  # Statement 1\n        T in prime_numbers and  # Statement 6\n        F in composite_numbers):  # Statement 7\n        # Check Statement 5\n        if (T == 0 or T == 4) and not (T == 0 and T == 4):\n            possible_solutions.append((T, F))\n\n# Number of possible solutions\nnum_possible_solutions = len(possible_solutions)\nnum_possible_solutions, possible_solutions\nassistant > It appears that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions simultaneously.
