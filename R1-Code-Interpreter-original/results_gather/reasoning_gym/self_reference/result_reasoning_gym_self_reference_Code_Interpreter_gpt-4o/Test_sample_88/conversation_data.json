    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of true statements among the seven given statements. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   - If this statement is true, then there are either 6 or 7 true statements.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 4 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   - If this statement is true, then there are at most 3 false statements, meaning there are at least 4 true statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   - If this statement is true, then there are exactly 5 true statements.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   - If this statement is true, then there are exactly 5 true statements.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'  \n   - This means that either Statement 3 is true or Statement 4 is true, but not both. If either is true, there are exactly 5 true statements.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'  \n   - The number of true statements must be a prime number (2, 3, 5, or 7).\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'  \n   - The number of false statements must be a composite number (4 or 6).\n\nLet's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If there are 7 true statements, then Statement 1 is true, but Statement 6 is false (since 0 is not a prime number).\n- If there are 6 true statements, then Statement 1 is true, but Statement 6 is false (since 1 is not a prime number).\n- If there are 5 true statements, then Statements 3, 4, and 5 are involved. Statement 6 is true (since 5 is a prime number), and Statement 7 is false (since 2 is not a composite number).\n- If there are 4 true statements, then Statement 2 is true, but Statement 6 is false (since 3 is a prime number, but 3 false statements are not composite).\n- If there are 3 true statements, then Statement 2 is true, but Statement 6 is false (since 4 is a composite number, but 4 true statements are not prime).\n- If there are 2 true statements, then Statement 6 is false (since 5 is not a composite number).\n- If there is 1 true statement, then Statement 6 is false (since 6 is not a prime number).\n\nFrom this analysis, we can see that the only consistent scenario is when there are exactly 5 true statements. Let's verify this:\n\n- Statement 1: False (since not at least 6 are true).\n- Statement 2: True (since at most 4 are false).\n- Statement 3: True (since exactly 5 are true).\n- Statement 4: True (since exactly 2 are false).\n- Statement 5: True (since either Statement 3 or 4 is true, but not both).\n- Statement 6: True (since 5 is a prime number).\n- Statement 7: False (since 2 is not a composite number).\n\nThus, there is only one consistent solution where exactly 5 statements are true. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]\n\nLet's enclose the final answer within triple angle brackets: <<<1>>>."
