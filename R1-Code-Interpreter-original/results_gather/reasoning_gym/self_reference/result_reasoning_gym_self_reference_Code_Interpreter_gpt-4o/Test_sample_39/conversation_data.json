    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nLet's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means the number of false statements \\( F \\leq 2 \\), or equivalently, \\( T \\geq 5 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 1 of these 7 statements is true.\"\n   - This means \\( T = 1 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means \\( F = 7 \\), or equivalently, \\( T = 0 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either Statement 3 is true (and Statement 4 is false) or Statement 4 is true (and Statement 3 is false).\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - This means \\( T \\) is a prime number (possible values: 2, 3, 5, 7).\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - This means \\( F \\) is a composite number (possible values: 4, 6).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the possible scenarios:\n\n- If Statement 3 is true, then \\( T = 1 \\). This contradicts Statement 1 and Statement 2, and it doesn't satisfy Statement 6. Therefore, Statement 3 cannot be true.\n\n- If Statement 4 is true, then \\( T = 0 \\). This contradicts Statement 1 and Statement 2, and it doesn't satisfy Statement 6. Therefore, Statement 4 cannot be true.\n\nSince neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 can be true, Statement 5 must be false.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible values for \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) that satisfy the remaining conditions:\n\n- \\( T \\geq 5 \\) (from Statement 2)\n- \\( T \\) is a prime number (from Statement 6)\n- \\( F \\) is a composite number (from Statement 7)\n\nLet's calculate the possible solutions.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Possible values for T (number of true statements) and F (number of false statements)\npossible_T_values = [5, 7]  # Prime numbers greater than or equal to 5\npossible_F_values = [4, 6]  # Composite numbers\n\n# Total number of statements\ntotal_statements = 7\n\n# Calculate possible solutions\npossible_solutions = 0\nfor T in possible_T_values:\n    F = total_statements - T\n    if F in possible_F_values:\n        possible_solutions += 1\n\npossible_solutions\nassistant > After evaluating the conditions, it turns out there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements simultaneously. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is: <<<0>>>."
