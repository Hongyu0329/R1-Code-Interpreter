    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the truth values of each statement and check for consistency. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.\"  \n   - This implies all 7 statements are true.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"  \n   - This implies at least 5 statements are true.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are true.\"  \n   - This implies 6 statements are false.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are false.\"  \n   - This implies 2 statements are true.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"  \n   - This implies one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"  \n   - Possible prime numbers for true statements are 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"  \n   - Possible composite numbers for false statements are 4, 6, or 8.\n\nLet's evaluate the consistency of these statements by considering different numbers of true statements and checking which statements can be true simultaneously. \n\nWe'll check each possible number of true statements from 0 to 7 and see if they satisfy all conditions.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the possible number of true statements and check each case\npossible_true_counts = range(8)  # From 0 to 7 true statements\nsolutions = []\n\nfor true_count in possible_true_counts:\n    false_count = 7 - true_count\n    \n    # Evaluate each statement based on the current true_count\n    statement_1 = (true_count >= 7)\n    statement_2 = (false_count <= 2)\n    statement_3 = (true_count == 1)\n    statement_4 = (false_count == 5)\n    statement_5 = (statement_3 != statement_4)  # XOR condition\n    statement_6 = (true_count in [2, 3, 5, 7])  # Prime numbers\n    statement_7 = (false_count in [4, 6, 8])  # Composite numbers\n    \n    # Check if the current configuration is consistent\n    if (statement_1 + statement_2 + statement_3 + statement_4 + \n        statement_5 + statement_6 + statement_7) == true_count:\n        solutions.append(true_count)\n\nlen(solutions)\nassistant > The number of possible solutions is <<<1>>>."
