    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all conditions.\n\nLet's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means there are 4, 5, 6, or 7 true statements.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 0 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means all statements are true (7 true statements).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means all statements are true.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means there are 4 true statements.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either all statements are true, or exactly 3 are false, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - Possible prime numbers for the number of true statements are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - Possible composite numbers for the number of false statements are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If all statements are true (7 true statements):\n  - Statement 2 is true.\n  - Statement 3 is true.\n  - Statement 5 is false (since both Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot be true).\n  - Statement 6 is true (7 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is false (0 is not a composite number).\n\n- If exactly 3 statements are false (4 true statements):\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 4 is true.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false).\n  - Statement 6 is false (4 is not a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (3 is a composite number).\n\nLet's determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all conditions.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the possible scenarios for the number of true statements\npossible_true_statements = [4, 7]\n\n# Check each scenario against the conditions\nsolutions = []\n\nfor true_statements in possible_true_statements:\n    false_statements = 7 - true_statements\n    \n    # Evaluate each statement\n    statement_1 = true_statements >= 4\n    statement_2 = false_statements <= 0\n    statement_3 = true_statements == 7\n    statement_4 = false_statements == 3\n    statement_5 = (statement_3 or statement_4) and not (statement_3 and statement_4)\n    statement_6 = true_statements in [2, 3, 5, 7]  # Prime numbers\n    statement_7 = false_statements in [4, 6]  # Composite numbers\n    \n    # Check if all conditions are satisfied\n    if all([statement_1, statement_2, statement_3, statement_4, statement_5, statement_6, statement_7]):\n        solutions.append((true_statements, false_statements))\n\n# Number of possible solutions\nnum_solutions = len(solutions)\nnum_solutions\nassistant > It appears that there are no scenarios where all the conditions are simultaneously satisfied. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is: <<<0>>>."
