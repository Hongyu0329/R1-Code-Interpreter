    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nLet's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.\"  \n   - This implies all statements are true.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.\"  \n   - This implies at least 6 statements are true.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are true.\"  \n   - This implies exactly 3 statements are true.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are false.\"  \n   - This implies all statements are true.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"  \n   - This implies one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"  \n   - This implies the number of true statements is 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"  \n   - This implies the number of false statements is 4 or 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If Statement 1 is true, then all statements are true, which contradicts Statement 3 and Statement 7.\n- If Statement 2 is true, then at least 6 statements are true.\n- If Statement 3 is true, then exactly 3 statements are true, which contradicts Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 4.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then all statements are true, which contradicts Statement 3 and Statement 7.\n- If Statement 5 is true, then either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n- If Statement 6 is true, then the number of true statements is 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n- If Statement 7 is true, then the number of false statements is 4 or 6.\n\nLet's evaluate the possible number of true statements:\n\n- **0 true statements**: Contradicts Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4, and Statement 6.\n- **1 true statement**: Contradicts Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4, and Statement 6.\n- **2 true statements**: Contradicts Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4, and Statement 5.\n- **3 true statements**: Satisfies Statement 3, Statement 5, and Statement 6. Contradicts Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 4.\n- **4 true statements**: Contradicts Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, and Statement 6.\n- **5 true statements**: Contradicts Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, and Statement 6.\n- **6 true statements**: Satisfies Statement 2. Contradicts Statement 3, Statement 4, and Statement 6.\n- **7 true statements**: Satisfies Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 4. Contradicts Statement 3, Statement 5, and Statement 7.\n\nLet's check which scenarios are consistent and count the number of possible solutions.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the possible number of true statements and check each scenario\npossible_true_counts = range(8)  # 0 to 7 true statements\nsolutions = []\n\nfor true_count in possible_true_counts:\n    false_count = 7 - true_count\n    \n    # Check each statement's condition\n    statement_1 = (true_count >= 7)\n    statement_2 = (true_count >= 6)\n    statement_3 = (true_count == 3)\n    statement_4 = (true_count == 7)\n    statement_5 = (statement_3 != statement_4)\n    statement_6 = (true_count in [2, 3, 5, 7])  # Prime numbers\n    statement_7 = (false_count in [4, 6])  # Composite numbers\n    \n    # Check if the scenario is consistent\n    if (statement_1 + statement_2 + statement_3 + statement_4 + statement_5 + statement_6 + statement_7) == true_count:\n        solutions.append(true_count)\n\n# Number of possible solutions\nnum_solutions = len(solutions)\nnum_solutions\nassistant > The number of possible solutions is <<<2>>>."
