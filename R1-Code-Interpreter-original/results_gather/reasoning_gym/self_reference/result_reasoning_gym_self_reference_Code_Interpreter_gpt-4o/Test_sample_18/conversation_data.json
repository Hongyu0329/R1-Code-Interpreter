    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of true statements among the seven given statements, while ensuring that all statements are consistent with each other. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This implies that the number of true statements \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This implies that the number of false statements \\( F \\leq 1 \\), or equivalently, \\( T \\geq 6 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This implies \\( T = 4 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This implies \\( F = 3 \\), or equivalently, \\( T = 4 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This implies that either \\( T = 4 \\) (Statement 3 is true) or \\( T = 4 \\) (Statement 4 is true), but not both. However, since both statements imply \\( T = 4 \\), this statement is inherently contradictory unless both are false.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - This implies \\( T \\) is a prime number. The possible prime numbers for \\( T \\) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - This implies \\( F \\) is a composite number. The possible composite numbers for \\( F \\) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the consistency of these statements:\n\n- From Statement 2, \\( T \\geq 6 \\).\n- From Statement 6, \\( T \\) must be a prime number, so \\( T = 7 \\) (since 7 is the only prime number greater than or equal to 6).\n- If \\( T = 7 \\), then \\( F = 0 \\), which is not a composite number, contradicting Statement 7.\n\nThus, \\( T = 7 \\) is not possible.\n\nLet's check if \\( T = 5 \\) is possible:\n\n- If \\( T = 5 \\), then \\( F = 2 \\), which is not a composite number, contradicting Statement 7.\n\nFinally, let's check if \\( T = 6 \\) is possible:\n\n- If \\( T = 6 \\), then \\( F = 1 \\), which is not a composite number, contradicting Statement 7.\n\nSince none of these scenarios are consistent, the only possibility is \\( T = 4 \\), but this contradicts Statement 2. Therefore, there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements.\n\nThus, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
