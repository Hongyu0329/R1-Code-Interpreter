    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all conditions.\n\nLet's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then there are either 6 or 7 true statements.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then there are either 0 or 1 false statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then there are exactly 2 true statements.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then there are exactly 3 false statements.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This statement is true if either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - This statement is true if the number of true statements is a prime number (2, 3, 5, 7).\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - This statement is true if the number of false statements is a composite number (4, 6).\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If Statement 1 is true, then there are 6 or 7 true statements.\n- If Statement 2 is true, then there are 0 or 1 false statements.\n- If Statement 3 is true, then there are 2 true statements.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then there are 3 false statements.\n- If Statement 5 is true, then either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n- If Statement 6 is true, then the number of true statements is a prime number.\n- If Statement 7 is true, then the number of false statements is a composite number.\n\nLet's evaluate the possible number of true statements (T) and false statements (F) that satisfy all conditions. We'll check each possible value of T from 0 to 7 and see if it satisfies all the statements.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the possible number of true statements (T) and false statements (F)\npossible_solutions = []\n\n# Check each possible value of T from 0 to 7\nfor T in range(8):\n    F = 7 - T  # Calculate the number of false statements\n    \n    # Check the conditions for each statement\n    cond1 = (T >= 6)  # Statement 1\n    cond2 = (F <= 1)  # Statement 2\n    cond3 = (T == 2)  # Statement 3\n    cond4 = (F == 3)  # Statement 4\n    cond5 = (cond3 != cond4)  # Statement 5\n    cond6 = (T in [2, 3, 5, 7])  # Statement 6 (prime numbers)\n    cond7 = (F in [4, 6])  # Statement 7 (composite numbers)\n    \n    # Check if all conditions are satisfied\n    if cond1 and cond2 and cond5 and cond6 and cond7:\n        possible_solutions.append((T, F))\n\n# Return the number of possible solutions\nlen(possible_solutions)\nassistant > After evaluating all possible scenarios, it turns out that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements simultaneously.
