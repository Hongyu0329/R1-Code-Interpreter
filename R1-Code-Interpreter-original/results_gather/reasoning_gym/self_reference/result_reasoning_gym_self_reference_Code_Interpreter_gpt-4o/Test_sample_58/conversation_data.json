    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of true statements among the seven given statements, based on the conditions provided by each statement. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements \\( T \\geq 2 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 4 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means the number of false statements \\( F \\leq 4 \\), or equivalently, \\( T \\geq 3 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means \\( T = 5 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means \\( F = 2 \\), or equivalently, \\( T = 5 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either \\( T = 5 \\) (from Statement 3) or \\( T = 5 \\) (from Statement 4), but not both. However, since both statements imply \\( T = 5 \\), this condition is satisfied if \\( T = 5 \\).\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - This means \\( T \\) is a prime number. The possible prime numbers for \\( T \\) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - This means \\( F \\) is a composite number. The possible composite numbers for \\( F \\) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's determine the number of possible solutions by checking the consistency of these conditions. We'll evaluate each possible value of \\( T \\) (the number of true statements) and see if it satisfies all the conditions.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Possible values for T (number of true statements)\npossible_T_values = [2, 3, 5, 7]\n\n# Function to check if a number is prime\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Function to check if a number is composite\ndef is_composite(n):\n    return n > 1 and not is_prime(n)\n\n# Check each possible value of T\npossible_solutions = 0\nfor T in possible_T_values:\n    F = 7 - T  # Number of false statements\n    # Check all conditions\n    if (T >= 2 and T >= 3 and (T == 5 or T == 5) and is_prime(T) and is_composite(F)):\n        possible_solutions += 1\n\npossible_solutions\nassistant > After evaluating the conditions for each possible number of true statements, it turns out that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements simultaneously.
