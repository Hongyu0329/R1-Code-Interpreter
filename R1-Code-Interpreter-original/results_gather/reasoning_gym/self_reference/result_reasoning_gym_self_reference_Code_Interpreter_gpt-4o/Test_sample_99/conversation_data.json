    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of true statements among the seven given statements, considering the conditions provided by each statement.\n\nLet's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means the number of true statements \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means the number of false statements \\( F \\leq 3 \\), which implies \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means \\( T = 3 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means \\( F = 2 \\), which implies \\( T = 5 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This means either \\( T = 3 \\) or \\( T = 5 \\), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - This means \\( T \\) is a prime number. The possible prime numbers for \\( T \\) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - This means \\( F \\) is a composite number. The possible composite numbers for \\( F \\) are 4, 6, etc.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the possible values of \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) that satisfy all these conditions. We'll check each possible value of \\( T \\) from 0 to 7 and see if it satisfies all the statements.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the possible values for T (number of true statements) and F (number of false statements)\npossible_T_values = range(8)  # T can be from 0 to 7\nprime_numbers = {2, 3, 5, 7}  # Prime numbers for T\ncomposite_numbers = {4, 6}    # Composite numbers for F\n\n# Initialize a list to store valid solutions\nvalid_solutions = []\n\n# Check each possible value of T\nfor T in possible_T_values:\n    F = 7 - T  # Calculate the number of false statements\n    \n    # Check the conditions for each statement\n    condition_1 = (T >= 4)  # Statement 1\n    condition_2 = (F <= 3)  # Statement 2\n    condition_3 = (T == 3)  # Statement 3\n    condition_4 = (F == 2)  # Statement 4\n    condition_5 = (condition_3 != condition_4)  # Statement 5\n    condition_6 = (T in prime_numbers)  # Statement 6\n    condition_7 = (F in composite_numbers)  # Statement 7\n    \n    # Check if all conditions are satisfied\n    if condition_1 and condition_2 and condition_5 and condition_6 and condition_7:\n        valid_solutions.append(T)\n\n# Return the number of valid solutions\nlen(valid_solutions)\nassistant > After evaluating the conditions for each possible number of true statements, it turns out that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements simultaneously. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is: <<<0>>>."
