    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nLet's denote the number of true statements as \\( T \\) and the number of false statements as \\( F \\). Since there are 7 statements in total, we have:\n\n\\[ T + F = 7 \\]\n\nNow, let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 1 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   - This implies \\( T \\geq 1 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   - This implies \\( F \\leq 3 \\), or equivalently \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   - This implies \\( T = 4 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   - This implies \\( F = 3 \\), or equivalently \\( T = 4 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'  \n   - This implies that either \\( T = 4 \\) (Statement 3 is true) or \\( F = 3 \\) (Statement 4 is true), but not both. However, since both conditions imply \\( T = 4 \\), this statement is inherently false.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'  \n   - This implies \\( T \\) is a prime number. The possible prime numbers for \\( T \\) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'  \n   - This implies \\( F \\) is a composite number. The possible composite numbers for \\( F \\) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's find the number of possible solutions that satisfy all these conditions. We'll check each possible value of \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) to see if they satisfy all the statements.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Possible values for T (number of true statements) and F (number of false statements)\npossible_T_values = [2, 3, 4, 5, 7]  # Prime numbers\npossible_F_values = [4, 6]           # Composite numbers\n\n# Check each possible value of T and F\npossible_solutions = []\nfor T in possible_T_values:\n    F = 7 - T\n    if F in possible_F_values:\n        # Check if all statements are satisfied\n        # Statement 1: T >= 1 (always true for T in possible_T_values)\n        # Statement 2: T >= 4\n        # Statement 3: T = 4\n        # Statement 4: T = 4\n        # Statement 5: False (as explained)\n        # Statement 6: T is prime (always true for T in possible_T_values)\n        # Statement 7: F is composite (checked in the loop)\n        if T >= 4 and T == 4:\n            possible_solutions.append((T, F))\n\n# Number of possible solutions\nnum_possible_solutions = len(possible_solutions)\nnum_possible_solutions\nassistant > After analyzing the conditions, it turns out there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements simultaneously. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
