    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of true statements among the seven given statements. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means the number of true statements \\( T \\geq 3 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means the number of false statements \\( F \\leq 3 \\), which implies \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means \\( T = 5 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means \\( F = 1 \\), which implies \\( T = 6 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This means either \\( T = 5 \\) or \\( T = 6 \\), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - Possible prime numbers for \\( T \\) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - Possible composite numbers for \\( F \\) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the constraints:\n\n- From Statement 1 and Statement 2, we have \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n- From Statement 5, we have \\( T = 5 \\) or \\( T = 6 \\).\n- From Statement 6, \\( T \\) must be a prime number, so \\( T = 5 \\) (since 6 is not prime).\n- From Statement 7, \\( F \\) must be a composite number, so \\( F = 4 \\) (since 2 is not composite).\n\nLet's check if these conditions are consistent:\n\n- If \\( T = 5 \\), then \\( F = 2 \\), which is not composite. So, \\( T = 5 \\) is not possible.\n- If \\( T = 6 \\), then \\( F = 1 \\), which is not composite. So, \\( T = 6 \\) is not possible.\n\nSince neither \\( T = 5 \\) nor \\( T = 6 \\) satisfies all conditions, let's check if there are any other possible solutions:\n\n- If \\( T = 4 \\), then \\( F = 3 \\), which is not composite. So, \\( T = 4 \\) is not possible.\n- If \\( T = 7 \\), then \\( F = 0 \\), which is not composite. So, \\( T = 7 \\) is not possible.\n\nSince none of the possible values for \\( T \\) satisfy all conditions, there are no possible solutions.\n\nThus, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
