    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of true and false statements that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 5 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means the number of true statements \\( T \\geq 5 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means the number of false statements \\( F \\leq 2 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means \\( T = 3 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means \\( F = 1 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This means either \\( T = 3 \\) or \\( F = 1 \\), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - Possible values for \\( T \\) are 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - Possible values for \\( F \\) are 4, 6, 8, etc.\n\nNow, let's find the number of possible solutions that satisfy all these conditions. We'll check each possible value of \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) to see if they satisfy all the statements. \n\nSince \\( T + F = 7 \\), we can use this to find the corresponding \\( F \\) for each \\( T \\). Let's evaluate the possibilities.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Possible values for T and F based on the constraints\npossible_solutions = []\n\n# Check each possible value of T (number of true statements)\nfor T in range(8):\n    F = 7 - T  # Since T + F = 7\n    \n    # Check all conditions\n    condition_1 = (T >= 5)  # At least 5 true\n    condition_2 = (F <= 2)  # At most 2 false\n    condition_3 = (T == 3)  # Exactly 3 true\n    condition_4 = (F == 1)  # Exactly 1 false\n    condition_5 = ((T == 3) != (F == 1))  # Either Statement 3 or 4 is true, but not both\n    condition_6 = (T in [2, 3, 5, 7])  # T is a prime number\n    condition_7 = (F in [4, 6, 8])  # F is a composite number\n    \n    # Check if all conditions are satisfied\n    if condition_1 and condition_2 and condition_5 and condition_6 and condition_7:\n        possible_solutions.append((T, F))\n\n# Number of possible solutions\nlen(possible_solutions)\nassistant > After evaluating all possible combinations of true and false statements, it turns out that there are no solutions that satisfy all the given conditions simultaneously. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is: <<<0>>>."
