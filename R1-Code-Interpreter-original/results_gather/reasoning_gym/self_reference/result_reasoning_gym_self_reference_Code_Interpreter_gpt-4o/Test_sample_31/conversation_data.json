    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.\"  \n   - This implies that all 7 statements are true.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"  \n   - This means that the number of false statements is 0, 1, 2, or 3.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"  \n   - This means that 4 statements are true and 3 are false.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"  \n   - This means that 3 statements are false and 4 are true.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"  \n   - This means that either Statement 3 is true or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"  \n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (between 0 and 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"  \n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (between 0 and 7) are 4, 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the consistency of these statements:\n\n- If Statement 1 is true, then all statements are true, which contradicts Statements 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.\n- If Statement 2 is true, then the number of false statements is 0, 1, 2, or 3.\n- If Statement 3 is true, then exactly 4 statements are true, which means 3 are false.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then exactly 3 statements are false, which means 4 are true.\n- If Statement 5 is true, then either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n- If Statement 6 is true, then the number of true statements is a prime number (2, 3, 5, or 7).\n- If Statement 7 is true, then the number of false statements is a composite number (4 or 6).\n\nLet's evaluate the possible scenarios for the number of true and false statements and check which ones satisfy all the conditions.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the possible number of true and false statements\npossible_true_counts = range(8)  # 0 to 7\npossible_false_counts = range(8)  # 0 to 7\n\n# Prime numbers for true statements\nprime_true_counts = {2, 3, 5, 7}\n\n# Composite numbers for false statements\ncomposite_false_counts = {4, 6}\n\n# Initialize a counter for the number of possible solutions\npossible_solutions = 0\n\n# Evaluate each possible scenario\nfor true_count in possible_true_counts:\n    false_count = 7 - true_count\n    \n    # Check the conditions for each statement\n    statement_1 = (true_count >= 7)\n    statement_2 = (false_count <= 3)\n    statement_3 = (true_count == 4)\n    statement_4 = (false_count == 3)\n    statement_5 = (statement_3 != statement_4)\n    statement_6 = (true_count in prime_true_counts)\n    statement_7 = (false_count in composite_false_counts)\n    \n    # Check if all conditions are satisfied\n    if (statement_1 + statement_2 + statement_3 + statement_4 + statement_5 + statement_6 + statement_7) == true_count:\n        possible_solutions += 1\n\npossible_solutions\nassistant > The number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements is \\(\\boxed{2}\\)."
