    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nLet's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then all 7 statements are true. However, this creates a contradiction because Statement 3 claims that exactly 0 statements are true. Therefore, Statement 1 must be false.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then at least 5 statements are true. However, this contradicts Statement 3, which claims that exactly 0 statements are true. Therefore, Statement 2 must be false.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - If this statement is true, it creates a paradox because it would mean that Statement 3 itself is true, which contradicts its own claim. Therefore, Statement 3 must be false.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then 3 statements are true. This is a possible scenario, so we will consider it.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - Since Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 must be true for Statement 5 to be true. This is consistent with our consideration of Statement 4 being true.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - If Statement 4 is true, then there are 3 true statements, which is a prime number. Therefore, Statement 6 is true.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - If Statement 4 is true, then there are 4 false statements, which is a composite number. Therefore, Statement 7 is true.\n\nNow, let's verify the consistency of this scenario:\n- If Statements 4, 5, 6, and 7 are true, then there are 3 true statements and 4 false statements.\n- This satisfies the conditions of Statements 4, 5, 6, and 7.\n\nTherefore, there is only one possible solution where Statements 4, 5, 6, and 7 are true, and Statements 1, 2, and 3 are false.\n\nThe number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
