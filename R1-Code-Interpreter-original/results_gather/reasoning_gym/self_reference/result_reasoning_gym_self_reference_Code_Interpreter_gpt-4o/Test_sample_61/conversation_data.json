    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy the truthfulness of the given statements. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 0 of these 7 statements are false.\" This implies that all statements are true.\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n\nLet's analyze the constraints:\n\n- Statement 2 implies that all statements are true, which contradicts the other statements that specify a certain number of true or false statements. Therefore, Statement 2 must be false.\n- Statement 5 implies that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This means one of them is true, and the other is false.\n- Statement 6 requires the number of true statements to be a prime number.\n- Statement 7 requires the number of false statements to be a composite number.\n\nLet's evaluate the possible number of true statements (T) and false statements (F):\n\n- If T = 4 (Statement 3 is true), then F = 3. This satisfies Statement 5, Statement 6 (since 4 is not a prime number), and Statement 7 (since 3 is not a composite number). However, this contradicts Statement 6, so T cannot be 4.\n- If T = 3 (Statement 4 is true), then F = 4. This satisfies Statement 5, Statement 6 (since 3 is a prime number), and Statement 7 (since 4 is a composite number).\n\nLet's verify if T = 3 and F = 4 satisfies all the conditions:\n\n- Statement 1: \"At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.\" This is satisfied.\n- Statement 2: \"At most 0 of these 7 statements are false.\" This is false, which is consistent with our earlier deduction.\n- Statement 3: \"Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.\" This is false.\n- Statement 4: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.\" This is true.\n- Statement 5: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\" This is satisfied.\n- Statement 6: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\" This is satisfied.\n- Statement 7: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\" This is satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the only possible solution is when T = 3 and F = 4.\n\nLet's conclude the number of possible solutions.\nassistant > Based on the analysis, there is only one possible solution that satisfies all the given conditions:\n\n- 3 statements are true, and 4 statements are false.\n\nThus, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{<<<1>>>}}\n\\]"
