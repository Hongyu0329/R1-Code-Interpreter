    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nLet's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements \\( T \\geq 3 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means the number of false statements \\( F \\leq 3 \\), which implies \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means \\( T = 7 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means \\( F = 2 \\), which implies \\( T = 5 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either \\( T = 7 \\) or \\( T = 5 \\), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - This means \\( T \\) is a prime number. The prime numbers between 1 and 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - This means \\( F \\) is a composite number. The composite numbers between 1 and 7 are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the possible values of \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) that satisfy all these conditions:\n\n- From Statements 1 and 2, we have \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n- From Statement 5, \\( T \\) can be either 7 or 5.\n- From Statement 6, \\( T \\) must be a prime number, so \\( T \\) can be 5 or 7.\n- From Statement 7, \\( F \\) must be a composite number, so \\( F \\) can be 4 or 6.\n\nLet's check the possible combinations of \\( T \\) and \\( F \\):\n\n1. \\( T = 5 \\), \\( F = 2 \\): \n   - Satisfies Statement 4.\n   - Satisfies Statement 5 (since Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false).\n   - Satisfies Statement 6 (5 is prime).\n   - Does not satisfy Statement 7 (2 is not composite).\n\n2. \\( T = 7 \\), \\( F = 0 \\):\n   - Satisfies Statement 3.\n   - Satisfies Statement 5 (since Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false).\n   - Satisfies Statement 6 (7 is prime).\n   - Does not satisfy Statement 7 (0 is not composite).\n\n3. \\( T = 6 \\), \\( F = 1 \\):\n   - Does not satisfy Statement 6 (6 is not prime).\n\n4. \\( T = 4 \\), \\( F = 3 \\):\n   - Does not satisfy Statement 5 (neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n\nLet's determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all conditions.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the possible values for T and F\npossible_values = [\n    (5, 2),  # T = 5, F = 2\n    (7, 0),  # T = 7, F = 0\n    (6, 1),  # T = 6, F = 1\n    (4, 3)   # T = 4, F = 3\n]\n\n# Check which combinations satisfy all conditions\nvalid_solutions = []\n\nfor T, F in possible_values:\n    # Check conditions\n    condition_1 = T >= 3\n    condition_2 = F <= 3\n    condition_3 = (T == 7)\n    condition_4 = (F == 2)\n    condition_5 = (condition_3 != condition_4)\n    condition_6 = (T in [2, 3, 5, 7])  # T is prime\n    condition_7 = (F in [4, 6])        # F is composite\n    \n    # Check if all conditions are satisfied\n    if condition_1 and condition_2 and condition_5 and condition_6 and condition_7:\n        valid_solutions.append((T, F))\n\n# Number of valid solutions\nnum_valid_solutions = len(valid_solutions)\nnum_valid_solutions\nassistant > After evaluating the possible combinations, it turns out that there are no solutions that satisfy all the given conditions simultaneously. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is: <<<0>>>."
