    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nLet's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.\"  \n   - If this statement is true, then all 7 statements must be true. However, this leads to a contradiction because Statement 4 claims exactly 5 statements are false, which cannot be true if all statements are true. Therefore, Statement 1 is false.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"  \n   - If this statement is true, then at least 5 statements are true. We need to check if this is consistent with other statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are true.\"  \n   - This is equivalent to Statement 1, which we determined to be false. Therefore, Statement 3 is false.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are false.\"  \n   - If this statement is true, then 2 statements are true. We need to check if this is consistent with other statements.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"  \n   - Since Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 must be true for Statement 5 to be true. Therefore, Statement 5 is true.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"  \n   - If Statement 4 is true, then there are 2 true statements. Since 2 is a prime number, Statement 6 is true.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"  \n   - If Statement 4 is true, then there are 5 false statements. Since 5 is not a composite number, Statement 7 is false.\n\nNow, let's verify the consistency of these evaluations:\n\n- If Statement 4 is true, then there are 2 true statements and 5 false statements.\n- Statement 5 is true because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 6 is true because 2 is a prime number.\n- Statement 7 is false because 5 is not a composite number.\n\nThe only consistent solution is when Statements 4, 5, and 6 are true, and the rest are false. This gives us exactly one possible solution.\n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
