    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements \\( T \\geq 3 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means the number of false statements \\( F \\leq 2 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 1 of these 7 statements is true.\"\n   - This means \\( T = 1 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 1 of these 7 statements is false.\"\n   - This means \\( F = 1 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false, or Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - This means \\( T \\) is a prime number.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - This means \\( F \\) is a composite number.\n\nLet's analyze the constraints:\n\n- From Statements 1 and 2, we have \\( 3 \\leq T \\leq 5 \\) (since \\( T + F = 7 \\)).\n- From Statement 5, either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n- From Statement 6, \\( T \\) must be a prime number. The prime numbers between 3 and 5 are 3 and 5.\n- From Statement 7, \\( F \\) must be a composite number. The composite numbers between 2 and 4 are 4.\n\nNow, let's check the possible values of \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) that satisfy all these conditions.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Possible values for T and F based on the constraints\npossible_T_values = [3, 5]  # Prime numbers between 3 and 5\npossible_F_values = [4]     # Composite number between 2 and 4\n\n# Check each combination of T and F\npossible_solutions = []\nfor T in possible_T_values:\n    F = 7 - T\n    if F in possible_F_values:\n        possible_solutions.append((T, F))\n\n# Number of possible solutions\nnum_possible_solutions = len(possible_solutions)\nnum_possible_solutions\nassistant > There is only one possible solution that satisfies all the given statements. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is: <<<1>>>."
