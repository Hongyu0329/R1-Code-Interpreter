    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nLet's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 5 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means there are 5, 6, or 7 true statements.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means there are 0 or 1 false statements, which implies 6 or 7 true statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means there are 5 true statements.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 6 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means there is 1 true statement.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either Statement 3 is true (5 true statements) or Statement 4 is true (1 true statement), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the consistency of these statements:\n\n- If Statement 3 is true (5 true statements), then:\n  - Statement 1 is true (5 or more true statements).\n  - Statement 2 is false (more than 1 false statement).\n  - Statement 4 is false (not 1 true statement).\n  - Statement 5 is true (either Statement 3 or 4 is true, but not both).\n  - Statement 6 is true (5 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is false (2 false statements, which is not composite).\n\n- If Statement 4 is true (1 true statement), then:\n  - Statement 1 is false (less than 5 true statements).\n  - Statement 2 is false (more than 1 false statement).\n  - Statement 3 is false (not 5 true statements).\n  - Statement 5 is true (either Statement 3 or 4 is true, but not both).\n  - Statement 6 is false (1 is not a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (6 false statements, which is composite).\n\nLet's check the consistency of these scenarios and count the number of possible solutions.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the possible number of true statements and check consistency with each statement\npossible_true_counts = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n\n# Initialize a counter for the number of possible solutions\npossible_solutions = 0\n\n# Check each possible number of true statements\nfor true_count in possible_true_counts:\n    false_count = 7 - true_count\n    \n    # Evaluate each statement based on the current true_count\n    statement_1 = (true_count >= 5)\n    statement_2 = (false_count <= 1)\n    statement_3 = (true_count == 5)\n    statement_4 = (false_count == 6)\n    statement_5 = (statement_3 != statement_4)\n    statement_6 = (true_count in [2, 3, 5, 7])  # Prime numbers\n    statement_7 = (false_count in [4, 6])       # Composite numbers\n    \n    # Check if all statements are consistent\n    if (statement_1 and statement_2 and statement_3 and statement_4 and\n        statement_5 and statement_6 and statement_7):\n        possible_solutions += 1\n\npossible_solutions\nassistant > After evaluating the consistency of each scenario, it turns out that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements simultaneously. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is: <<<0>>>."
