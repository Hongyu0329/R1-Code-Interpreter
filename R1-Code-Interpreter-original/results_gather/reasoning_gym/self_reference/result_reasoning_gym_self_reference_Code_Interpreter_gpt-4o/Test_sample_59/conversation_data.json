    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy the truthfulness of the given statements. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This implies that either 6 or 7 statements are true.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies that either 6 or 7 statements are true.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 6 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This implies that 6 statements are true.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies that 2 statements are true.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This implies that either Statement 3 is true (6 statements are true) or Statement 4 is true (2 statements are true), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the consistency of these statements:\n\n- If 6 statements are true:\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is true.\n  - Statement 3 is true.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false).\n  - Statement 6 is true (since 6 is not a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is false (since 1 is not a composite number).\n\n- If 7 statements are true:\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is true.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is false (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is false (since 7 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is false (since 0 is not a composite number).\n\n- If 2 statements are true:\n  - Statement 1 is false.\n  - Statement 2 is false.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is true.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false).\n  - Statement 6 is false (since 2 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (since 5 is a composite number).\n\nLet's check the consistency of these scenarios and count the number of possible solutions.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the possible scenarios for the number of true statements\nscenarios = {\n    6: {\n        \"Statement 1\": True,\n        \"Statement 2\": True,\n        \"Statement 3\": True,\n        \"Statement 4\": False,\n        \"Statement 5\": True,\n        \"Statement 6\": False,  # 6 is not a prime number\n        \"Statement 7\": False   # 1 is not a composite number\n    },\n    7: {\n        \"Statement 1\": True,\n        \"Statement 2\": True,\n        \"Statement 3\": False,\n        \"Statement 4\": False,\n        \"Statement 5\": False,\n        \"Statement 6\": False,  # 7 is a prime number\n        \"Statement 7\": False   # 0 is not a composite number\n    },\n    2: {\n        \"Statement 1\": False,\n        \"Statement 2\": False,\n        \"Statement 3\": False,\n        \"Statement 4\": True,\n        \"Statement 5\": True,\n        \"Statement 6\": False,  # 2 is a prime number\n        \"Statement 7\": True    # 5 is a composite number\n    }\n}\n\n# Check the consistency of each scenario\nconsistent_scenarios = [scenario for scenario, truth_values in scenarios.items() if all(truth_values.values())]\n\n# Count the number of consistent scenarios\nnum_possible_solutions = len(consistent_scenarios)\nnum_possible_solutions\nassistant > After analyzing the scenarios, it turns out that none of the scenarios are consistent with all the given statements.
