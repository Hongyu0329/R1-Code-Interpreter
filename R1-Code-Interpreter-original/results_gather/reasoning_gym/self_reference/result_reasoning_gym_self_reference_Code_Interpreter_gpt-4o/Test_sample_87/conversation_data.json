    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nLet's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This implies all 7 statements are true.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 4 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies at least 3 statements are true.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This implies all 7 statements are false.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies 4 statements are true.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This implies one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - Possible prime numbers for true statements are 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - Possible composite numbers for false statements are 4, 6, or 8.\n\nNow, let's analyze the consistency of these statements:\n\n- If Statement 1 is true, then all statements are true, which contradicts Statement 3.\n- If Statement 3 is true, then all statements are false, which contradicts Statement 1.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then 4 statements are true, which is consistent with Statement 2.\n- Statement 5 requires that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n- Statement 6 requires the number of true statements to be a prime number.\n- Statement 7 requires the number of false statements to be a composite number.\n\nLet's evaluate the possible number of true statements and check for consistency:\n\n1. **0 true statements**: \n   - Contradicts Statement 2 and Statement 4.\n\n2. **1 true statement**: \n   - Contradicts Statement 2 and Statement 4.\n\n3. **2 true statements**: \n   - Contradicts Statement 4.\n\n4. **3 true statements**: \n   - Consistent with Statement 2, Statement 4, Statement 6 (3 is prime), and Statement 7 (4 false statements is composite).\n\n5. **4 true statements**: \n   - Consistent with Statement 2, Statement 4, Statement 5, and Statement 7 (3 false statements is not composite).\n\n6. **5 true statements**: \n   - Consistent with Statement 2, Statement 6 (5 is prime), and Statement 7 (2 false statements is not composite).\n\n7. **6 true statements**: \n   - Contradicts Statement 4.\n\n8. **7 true statements**: \n   - Contradicts Statement 3.\n\nLet's check which of these scenarios satisfy all the conditions.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the possible number of true statements and check for consistency with each statement\ndef check_consistency(true_statements):\n    false_statements = 7 - true_statements\n    is_prime = lambda x: x in [2, 3, 5, 7]\n    is_composite = lambda x: x in [4, 6, 8]\n    \n    # Check each statement\n    statement_1 = (true_statements >= 7)\n    statement_2 = (false_statements <= 4)\n    statement_3 = (true_statements == 0)\n    statement_4 = (false_statements == 3)\n    statement_5 = (statement_3 != statement_4)\n    statement_6 = is_prime(true_statements)\n    statement_7 = is_composite(false_statements)\n    \n    # Check if all conditions are satisfied\n    return (statement_1, statement_2, statement_3, statement_4, statement_5, statement_6, statement_7)\n\n# Check for each possible number of true statements\npossible_solutions = []\nfor true_statements in range(8):\n    if all(check_consistency(true_statements)):\n        possible_solutions.append(true_statements)\n\nlen(possible_solutions)\nassistant > It appears that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements simultaneously.
