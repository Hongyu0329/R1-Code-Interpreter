    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nLet's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 1 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means that there cannot be a scenario where all statements are false.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means that there can be 0, 1, or 2 false statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means all statements are false, which contradicts Statement 1. Therefore, Statement 3 must be false.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means all statements are true.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - Since Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 must be true for Statement 5 to be true.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - If Statement 4 is true, then all 7 statements are true, and 7 is a prime number.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - If all statements are true, then there are 0 false statements, and 0 is not a composite number.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the possible scenarios:\n\n- If all statements are true, then Statements 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 are true, but Statement 7 is false. This scenario satisfies the condition of having at most 2 false statements (specifically, 1 false statement).\n\n- If there are 6 true statements and 1 false statement, we need to check which statements can be false while satisfying all conditions.\n\nLet's calculate the number of possible solutions.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom sympy import isprime\n\n# Total number of statements\ntotal_statements = 7\n\n# Possible number of true statements\npossible_true_counts = []\n\n# Check for each possible number of true statements\nfor true_count in range(total_statements + 1):\n    false_count = total_statements - true_count\n    \n    # Check conditions\n    if true_count >= 1 and false_count <= 2:\n        if (true_count == 7 or true_count == 0) and (false_count == 0 or false_count == 7):\n            continue  # Skip impossible scenarios\n        if isprime(true_count) and (false_count == 0 or false_count > 1):\n            possible_true_counts.append(true_count)\n\n# Number of possible solutions\nnum_possible_solutions = len(possible_true_counts)\nnum_possible_solutions\nassistant > The number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements is <<<1>>>."
