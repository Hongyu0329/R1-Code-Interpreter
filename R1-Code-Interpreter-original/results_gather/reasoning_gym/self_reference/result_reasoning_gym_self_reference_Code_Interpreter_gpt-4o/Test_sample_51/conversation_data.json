    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 1 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means that there must be at least one true statement among the seven.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies that there can be at most 3 false statements, meaning there must be at least 4 true statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 6 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means that if this statement is true, then there are exactly 6 true statements.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means that if this statement is true, then there are exactly 3 false statements, which implies 4 true statements.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means that either Statement 3 is true or Statement 4 is true, but not both simultaneously.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (between 1 and 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (between 0 and 6) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If Statement 3 is true, then there are 6 true statements and 1 false statement. This contradicts Statement 6, as 6 is not a prime number. Therefore, Statement 3 cannot be true.\n\n- If Statement 4 is true, then there are 4 true statements and 3 false statements. This satisfies Statement 6, as 4 is not a prime number, but it contradicts Statement 7, as 3 is not a composite number. Therefore, Statement 4 cannot be true.\n\nSince neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 can be true, Statement 5 is false.\n\nNow, let's consider the number of true statements:\n\n- If there are 2 true statements, then there are 5 false statements. This satisfies Statement 6, as 2 is a prime number, but it contradicts Statement 7, as 5 is not a composite number.\n\n- If there are 3 true statements, then there are 4 false statements. This satisfies both Statement 6 and Statement 7, as 3 is a prime number and 4 is a composite number.\n\n- If there are 5 true statements, then there are 2 false statements. This satisfies Statement 6, as 5 is a prime number, but it contradicts Statement 7, as 2 is not a composite number.\n\n- If there are 7 true statements, then there are 0 false statements. This satisfies Statement 6, as 7 is a prime number, but it contradicts Statement 7, as 0 is not a composite number.\n\nTherefore, the only scenario that satisfies all the conditions is when there are 3 true statements and 4 false statements. Let's verify:\n\n- Statement 1 is true because there is at least 1 true statement.\n- Statement 2 is false because there are more than 3 false statements.\n- Statement 3 is false because there are not exactly 6 true statements.\n- Statement 4 is false because there are not exactly 3 false statements.\n- Statement 5 is false because neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true.\n- Statement 6 is true because the number of true statements (3) is a prime number.\n- Statement 7 is true because the number of false statements (4) is a composite number.\n\nThus, there is only one possible solution. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\[\n<<<1>>>\n\\]"
