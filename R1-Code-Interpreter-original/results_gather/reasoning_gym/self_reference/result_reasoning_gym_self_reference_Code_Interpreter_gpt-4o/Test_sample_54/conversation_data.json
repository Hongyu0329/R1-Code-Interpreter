    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\nLet's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This implies that there are either 6 or 7 true statements.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies that there are either 0, 1, or 2 false statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 6 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This implies that there is exactly 1 false statement.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies that all 7 statements are true.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This implies that either Statement 3 is true (exactly 6 true statements) or Statement 4 is true (exactly 7 true statements), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (from 0 to 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (from 0 to 7) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the possible scenarios:\n\n- If there are 7 true statements:\n  - Statement 4 is true, which means Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is true because either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n  - The number of true statements (7) is a prime number, so Statement 6 is true.\n  - The number of false statements (0) is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false.\n  - This scenario satisfies Statements 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6, but not Statement 7.\n\n- If there are 6 true statements:\n  - Statement 3 is true, which means Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is true because either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n  - The number of true statements (6) is not a prime number, so Statement 6 is false.\n  - The number of false statements (1) is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false.\n  - This scenario satisfies Statements 1, 2, 3, and 5, but not Statements 6 and 7.\n\n- If there are 5 true statements:\n  - Statement 1 is false because there are not at least 6 true statements.\n  - Statement 2 is true because there are at most 2 false statements.\n  - Statement 3 is false because there are not exactly 6 true statements.\n  - Statement 4 is false because there are not exactly 0 false statements.\n  - Statement 5 is false because neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true.\n  - The number of true statements (5) is a prime number, so Statement 6 is true.\n  - The number of false statements (2) is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false.\n  - This scenario satisfies Statements 2 and 6, but not Statements 1, 3, 4, 5, and 7.\n\n- If there are 4 true statements:\n  - Statement 1 is false because there are not at least 6 true statements.\n  - Statement 2 is true because there are at most 2 false statements.\n  - Statement 3 is false because there are not exactly 6 true statements.\n  - Statement 4 is false because there are not exactly 0 false statements.\n  - Statement 5 is false because neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true.\n  - The number of true statements (4) is not a prime number, so Statement 6 is false.\n  - The number of false statements (3) is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false.\n  - This scenario satisfies only Statement 2.\n\n- If there are 3 true statements:\n  - Statement 1 is false because there are not at least 6 true statements.\n  - Statement 2 is true because there are at most 2 false statements.\n  - Statement 3 is false because there are not exactly 6 true statements.\n  - Statement 4 is false because there are not exactly 0 false statements.\n  - Statement 5 is false because neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true.\n  - The number of true statements (3) is a prime number, so Statement 6 is true.\n  - The number of false statements (4) is a composite number, so Statement 7 is true.\n  - This scenario satisfies Statements 2, 6, and 7.\n\n- If there are 2 true statements:\n  - Statement 1 is false because there are not at least 6 true statements.\n  - Statement 2 is true because there are at most 2 false statements.\n  - Statement 3 is false because there are not exactly 6 true statements.\n  - Statement 4 is false because there are not exactly 0 false statements.\n  - Statement 5 is false because neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true.\n  - The number of true statements (2) is a prime number, so Statement 6 is true.\n  - The number of false statements (5) is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false.\n  - This scenario satisfies Statements 2 and 6.\n\n- If there is 1 true statement:\n  - Statement 1 is false because there are not at least 6 true statements.\n  - Statement 2 is false because there are more than 2 false statements.\n  - Statement 3 is false because there are not exactly 6 true statements.\n  - Statement 4 is false because there are not exactly 0 false statements.\n  - Statement 5 is false because neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true.\n  - The number of true statements (1) is not a prime number, so Statement 6 is false.\n  - The number of false statements (6) is a composite number, so Statement 7 is true.\n  - This scenario satisfies only Statement 7.\n\n- If there are 0 true statements:\n  - Statement 1 is false because there are not at least 6 true statements.\n  - Statement 2 is false because there are more than 2 false statements.\n  - Statement 3 is false because there are not exactly 6 true statements.\n  - Statement 4 is false because there are not exactly 0 false statements.\n  - Statement 5 is false because neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true.\n  - The number of true statements (0) is not a prime number, so Statement 6 is false.\n  - The number of false statements (7) is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false.\n  - This scenario satisfies none of the statements.\n\nFrom the analysis, the only scenario that satisfies all the conditions is when there are 3 true statements. Therefore, there is only one possible solution.\n\nThe number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
