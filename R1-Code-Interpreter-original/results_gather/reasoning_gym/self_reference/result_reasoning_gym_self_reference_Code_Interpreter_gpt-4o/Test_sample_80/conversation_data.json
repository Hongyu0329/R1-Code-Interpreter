    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of true statements among the seven given statements. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This implies that there are either 6 or 7 true statements.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 4 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies that there are at most 3 true statements (since 7 - 4 = 3).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This implies that there are exactly 4 true statements.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies that there are exactly 4 true statements (since 7 - 3 = 4).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This implies that either Statement 3 is true or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the consistency of these statements to find the number of possible solutions. We'll check each possible number of true statements from 0 to 7 and see which ones satisfy all the conditions.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the possible number of true statements and check each case\npossible_true_counts = range(8)  # From 0 to 7\nsolutions = []\n\nfor true_count in possible_true_counts:\n    false_count = 7 - true_count\n    \n    # Check each statement's condition\n    statement_1 = (true_count >= 6)\n    statement_2 = (false_count <= 4)\n    statement_3 = (true_count == 4)\n    statement_4 = (false_count == 3)\n    statement_5 = (statement_3 != statement_4)\n    statement_6 = (true_count in [2, 3, 5, 7])  # Prime numbers\n    statement_7 = (false_count in [4, 6])  # Composite numbers\n    \n    # Check if all statements are consistent\n    if all([statement_1, statement_2, statement_3, statement_4, statement_5, statement_6, statement_7]):\n        solutions.append(true_count)\n\n# Return the number of possible solutions\nlen(solutions)\nassistant > After analyzing the conditions, it turns out that there are no possible solutions where all the statements are consistent with each other. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is: <<<0>>>."
