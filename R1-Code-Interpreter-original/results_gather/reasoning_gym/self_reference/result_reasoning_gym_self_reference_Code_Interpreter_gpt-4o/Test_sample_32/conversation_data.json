    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\nLet's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements \\( T \\geq 2 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means the number of false statements \\( F \\leq 1 \\), which implies \\( T \\geq 6 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means \\( T = 4 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means \\( F = 3 \\), which implies \\( T = 4 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either \\( T = 4 \\) or \\( F = 3 \\), but not both. Since both imply the same condition, this statement is inherently false.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - This means \\( T \\) is a prime number.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - This means \\( F \\) is a composite number.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the possible values for \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) that satisfy all these conditions:\n\n- From Statement 2, \\( T \\geq 6 \\).\n- From Statement 6, \\( T \\) must be a prime number. The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n- From Statement 7, \\( F \\) must be a composite number. The composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6.\n\nLet's check the possible values for \\( T \\) and \\( F \\):\n\n- If \\( T = 6 \\), then \\( F = 1 \\). This satisfies Statement 2, but \\( F = 1 \\) is not composite, so it doesn't satisfy Statement 7.\n- If \\( T = 7 \\), then \\( F = 0 \\). This satisfies Statement 2, but \\( F = 0 \\) is not composite, so it doesn't satisfy Statement 7.\n\nSince neither of these possibilities satisfies all the conditions, there are no possible solutions.\n\nThus, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
