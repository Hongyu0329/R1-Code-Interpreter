    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of true statements among the seven given statements. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means the number of true statements \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means the number of false statements \\( F \\leq 1 \\), or equivalently, \\( T \\geq 6 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means \\( T = 4 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means \\( F = 3 \\), or equivalently, \\( T = 4 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This means either \\( T = 4 \\) (Statement 3 is true) or \\( T = 4 \\) (Statement 4 is true), but not both. Since both statements imply \\( T = 4 \\), this statement is always true if \\( T = 4 \\).\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - This means \\( T \\) is a prime number. The possible prime numbers for \\( T \\) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - This means \\( F \\) is a composite number. The possible composite numbers for \\( F \\) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values of \\( T \\) and check which satisfy all the conditions:\n\n- If \\( T = 4 \\):\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is false.\n  - Statement 3 is true.\n  - Statement 4 is true.\n  - Statement 5 is false (since both Statements 3 and 4 are true).\n  - Statement 6 is false (4 is not a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (3 is not a composite number).\n\n- If \\( T = 5 \\):\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is false.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since both Statements 3 and 4 are false).\n  - Statement 6 is true (5 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (2 is not a composite number).\n\n- If \\( T = 6 \\):\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is true.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since both Statements 3 and 4 are false).\n  - Statement 6 is false (6 is not a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is false (1 is not a composite number).\n\n- If \\( T = 7 \\):\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is true.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since both Statements 3 and 4 are false).\n  - Statement 6 is true (7 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is false (0 is not a composite number).\n\nLet's determine the number of possible solutions by checking which values of \\( T \\) satisfy all the conditions.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the possible values for T and check the conditions for each\npossible_T_values = [4, 5, 6, 7]\nsolutions = []\n\nfor T in possible_T_values:\n    F = 7 - T\n    statement_1 = (T >= 4)\n    statement_2 = (F <= 1)\n    statement_3 = (T == 4)\n    statement_4 = (F == 3)\n    statement_5 = (statement_3 != statement_4)\n    statement_6 = (T in [2, 3, 5, 7])  # Prime numbers\n    statement_7 = (F in [4, 6])  # Composite numbers\n    \n    # Check if all conditions are satisfied\n    if (statement_1 and statement_2 and statement_3 and statement_4 and\n        statement_5 and statement_6 and statement_7):\n        solutions.append(T)\n\n# Number of possible solutions\nnum_solutions = len(solutions)\nnum_solutions\nassistant > After evaluating the conditions for each possible value of \\( T \\), it turns out that there are no values that satisfy all the given statements simultaneously. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is: <<<0>>>."
