    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n\nLet's analyze the constraints:\n\n- From Statement 2, at most 2 statements can be false, which means at least 5 statements must be true.\n- From Statement 1, at least 2 statements must be true.\n- From Statement 5, either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This means either exactly 4 statements are true or exactly 2 statements are false, but not both.\n- From Statement 6, the number of true statements must be a prime number.\n- From Statement 7, the number of false statements must be a composite number.\n\nLet's evaluate the possible number of true statements (T) and false statements (F) that satisfy all these conditions:\n\n- If T = 5, then F = 2. This satisfies Statement 2, Statement 4, and Statement 5 (since Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false). The number of true statements (5) is a prime number, and the number of false statements (2) is not a composite number, so this does not satisfy Statement 7.\n- If T = 6, then F = 1. This satisfies Statement 2, but not Statement 4 or Statement 5. The number of true statements (6) is not a prime number, so this does not satisfy Statement 6.\n- If T = 7, then F = 0. This satisfies Statement 2, but not Statement 4 or Statement 5. The number of true statements (7) is a prime number, but the number of false statements (0) is not a composite number, so this does not satisfy Statement 7.\n\nLet's check if there are any other possibilities. Since T must be at least 5 (from Statement 2) and at most 7 (since there are only 7 statements), we have exhausted all possibilities.\n\nNow, let's count the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\nassistant > Upon reviewing the constraints and analyzing the possible number of true and false statements, we find:\n\n- **T = 5, F = 2**: \n  - Satisfies Statement 2 (at most 2 false).\n  - Satisfies Statement 4 (exactly 2 false).\n  - Satisfies Statement 5 (Statement 4 is true, Statement 3 is false).\n  - Satisfies Statement 6 (5 is a prime number).\n  - Does not satisfy Statement 7 (2 is not a composite number).\n\n- **T = 6, F = 1**: \n  - Satisfies Statement 2 (at most 2 false).\n  - Does not satisfy Statement 4 (not exactly 2 false).\n  - Does not satisfy Statement 5 (neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Does not satisfy Statement 6 (6 is not a prime number).\n  - Does not satisfy Statement 7 (1 is not a composite number).\n\n- **T = 7, F = 0**: \n  - Satisfies Statement 2 (at most 2 false).\n  - Does not satisfy Statement 4 (not exactly 2 false).\n  - Does not satisfy Statement 5 (neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Satisfies Statement 6 (7 is a prime number).\n  - Does not satisfy Statement 7 (0 is not a composite number).\n\nGiven these evaluations, none of the scenarios satisfy all the conditions, particularly Statement 7. Therefore, there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements.\n\nThus, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]\n\nThe final answer is: <<<0>>>."
