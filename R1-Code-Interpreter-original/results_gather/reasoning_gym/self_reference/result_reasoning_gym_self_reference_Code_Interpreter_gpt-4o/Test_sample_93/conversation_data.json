Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   - This implies all statements are true.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 6 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   - This is always true because there are only 7 statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   - This implies 5 statements are true and 2 are false.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 6 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   - This implies 1 statement is true and 6 are false.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'  \n   - This implies one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'  \n   - Possible prime numbers for the number of true statements are 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'  \n   - Possible composite numbers for the number of false statements are 4 or 6.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the consistency of these statements to find the number of possible solutions.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom sympy import isprime\n\n# Possible number of true and false statements\npossible_true_counts = [2, 3, 5, 7]  # Prime numbers\npossible_false_counts = [4, 6]       # Composite numbers\n\n# Check each combination of true and false counts\nsolutions = []\nfor true_count in possible_true_counts:\n    false_count = 7 - true_count\n    if false_count in possible_false_counts:\n        # Evaluate each statement based on the true and false counts\n        statement_truths = [\n            true_count >= 7,  # Statement 1\n            false_count <= 6, # Statement 2\n            true_count == 5,  # Statement 3\n            false_count == 6, # Statement 4\n            (true_count == 5) != (false_count == 6), # Statement 5\n            isprime(true_count), # Statement 6\n            false_count in possible_false_counts # Statement 7\n        ]\n        \n        # Check if the combination is consistent\n        if all(statement_truths):\n            solutions.append((true_count, false_count))\n\nlen(solutions)\nassistant > After evaluating the consistency of the statements, it turns out that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.
