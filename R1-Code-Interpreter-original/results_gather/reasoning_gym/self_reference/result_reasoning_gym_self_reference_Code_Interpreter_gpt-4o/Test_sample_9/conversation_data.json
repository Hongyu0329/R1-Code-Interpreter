    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of true statements among the seven given statements. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements \\( T \\geq 3 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 7 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This is always true because there are only 7 statements, so \\( F \\leq 7 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means \\( T = 4 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means \\( F = 3 \\) or \\( T = 4 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either \\( T = 4 \\) or \\( F = 3 \\), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - Possible prime numbers for \\( T \\) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - Possible composite numbers for \\( F \\) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values for \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) that satisfy all these conditions:\n\n- If \\( T = 4 \\), then \\( F = 3 \\). This satisfies Statements 3, 4, and 5, but not Statement 6 (since 4 is not a prime number).\n- If \\( T = 3 \\), then \\( F = 4 \\). This satisfies Statements 1, 6, and 7, but not Statement 3 or 4.\n- If \\( T = 5 \\), then \\( F = 2 \\). This satisfies Statement 6, but not Statement 7.\n- If \\( T = 7 \\), then \\( F = 0 \\). This satisfies Statement 6, but not Statement 7.\n\nLet's check which of these combinations satisfy all the conditions.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the possible values for T (true statements) and F (false statements)\npossible_T_values = [3, 4, 5, 7]\npossible_F_values = [4, 3, 2, 0]\n\n# Define the conditions for each statement\ndef check_conditions(T, F):\n    conditions = [\n        T >= 3,  # Statement 1\n        F <= 7,  # Statement 2 (always true)\n        T == 4,  # Statement 3\n        F == 3,  # Statement 4\n        (T == 4) != (F == 3),  # Statement 5\n        T in [2, 3, 5, 7],  # Statement 6\n        F in [4, 6]  # Statement 7\n    ]\n    return conditions\n\n# Check which combinations satisfy all conditions\nvalid_solutions = []\nfor T, F in zip(possible_T_values, possible_F_values):\n    conditions = check_conditions(T, F)\n    if all(conditions):\n        valid_solutions.append((T, F))\n\nlen(valid_solutions)\nassistant > It seems there are no combinations of \\( T \\) (true statements) and \\( F \\) (false statements) that satisfy all the given conditions simultaneously. Therefore, there are no possible solutions.\n\nThe number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
