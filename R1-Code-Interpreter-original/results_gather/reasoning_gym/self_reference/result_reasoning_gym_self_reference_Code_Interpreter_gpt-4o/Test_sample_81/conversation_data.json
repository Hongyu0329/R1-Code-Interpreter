    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nLet's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This implies all statements are true.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies at least 2 statements are true.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This implies 3 statements are true.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies all statements are true.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This implies either 3 statements are true or all statements are true, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - Possible prime numbers for the number of true statements are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - Possible composite numbers for the number of false statements are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If all 7 statements are true, then:\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is true.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is true.\n  - Statement 5 is false (since both Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot be true).\n  - Statement 6 is true (7 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is false (0 is not a composite number).\n\n- If exactly 3 statements are true, then:\n  - Statement 1 is false.\n  - Statement 2 is true.\n  - Statement 3 is true.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both).\n  - Statement 6 is true (3 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (4 is a composite number).\n\nLet's check if there are any other possible solutions. We will evaluate the number of true statements for each possible scenario and check if they satisfy all conditions.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the possible number of true statements and check each scenario\npossible_true_counts = [2, 3, 5, 7]  # Prime numbers\npossible_false_counts = [4, 6]  # Composite numbers\n\n# Function to check if a scenario is valid\ndef is_valid_scenario(true_count, false_count):\n    # Check each statement\n    statement_1 = (true_count >= 7)\n    statement_2 = (false_count <= 5)\n    statement_3 = (true_count == 3)\n    statement_4 = (false_count == 0)\n    statement_5 = (statement_3 != statement_4)\n    statement_6 = (true_count in possible_true_counts)\n    statement_7 = (false_count in possible_false_counts)\n    \n    # All statements must be consistent\n    return all([statement_1, statement_2, statement_3, statement_4, statement_5, statement_6, statement_7])\n\n# Check all possible scenarios\nvalid_scenarios = []\nfor true_count in possible_true_counts:\n    false_count = 7 - true_count\n    if is_valid_scenario(true_count, false_count):\n        valid_scenarios.append((true_count, false_count))\n\nlen(valid_scenarios)\nassistant > It appears that there are no scenarios where all the statements are consistent with each other. This means there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
