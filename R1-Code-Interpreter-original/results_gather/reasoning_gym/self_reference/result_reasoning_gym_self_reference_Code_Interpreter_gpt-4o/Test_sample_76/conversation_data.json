    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements \\( T \\geq 2 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means the number of false statements \\( F \\leq 2 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means \\( T = 4 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 1 of these 7 statements is false.\"\n   - This means \\( F = 1 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either \\( T = 4 \\) or \\( F = 1 \\), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - Possible prime numbers for \\( T \\) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - Possible composite numbers for \\( F \\) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the constraints:\n\n- From Statement 2, \\( F \\leq 2 \\), so possible values for \\( F \\) are 0, 1, or 2.\n- From Statement 4, \\( F = 1 \\).\n- From Statement 5, if Statement 4 is true, then Statement 3 must be false, so \\( T \\neq 4 \\).\n- From Statement 6, \\( T \\) must be a prime number.\n- From Statement 7, \\( F \\) must be a composite number, but since \\( F = 1 \\) (from Statement 4), this statement cannot be true.\n\nLet's check the consistency of these statements and find the number of possible solutions.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Possible values for T (number of true statements) and F (number of false statements)\nprime_numbers = [2, 3, 5, 7]\ncomposite_numbers = [4, 6]\n\n# Check the constraints\npossible_solutions = []\n\n# Iterate over possible values of T and F\nfor T in prime_numbers:\n    F = 7 - T\n    # Check all conditions\n    if F <= 2 and F in composite_numbers:\n        # Statement 1: At least 2 of these 7 statements are true\n        if T >= 2:\n            # Statement 2: At most 2 of these 7 statements are false\n            if F <= 2:\n                # Statement 5: Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both\n                if (T == 4) != (F == 1):\n                    possible_solutions.append((T, F))\n\nlen(possible_solutions)\nassistant > Upon analyzing the constraints, it appears that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements simultaneously.
