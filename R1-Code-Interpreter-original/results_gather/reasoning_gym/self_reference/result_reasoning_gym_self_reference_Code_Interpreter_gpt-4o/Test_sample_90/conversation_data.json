    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\nLet's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements \\( T \\geq 2 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means the number of false statements \\( F \\leq 5 \\), which implies \\( T \\geq 2 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means \\( T = 5 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means \\( F = 7 \\), which is impossible because it contradicts the existence of true statements.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either \\( T = 5 \\) or \\( F = 7 \\), but not both. Since \\( F = 7 \\) is impossible, this implies \\( T = 5 \\).\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - This means \\( T \\) is a prime number. The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - This means \\( F \\) is a composite number. The composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4, 6, and 8.\n\nNow, let's determine the number of possible solutions by checking the consistency of these conditions. We'll consider the possible values of \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) and see which ones satisfy all the statements.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Possible values for T (number of true statements) and F (number of false statements)\n# T + F = 7\n\n# Prime numbers less than or equal to 7\nprime_numbers = {2, 3, 5, 7}\n\n# Composite numbers less than or equal to 7\ncomposite_numbers = {4, 6, 8}\n\n# Check possible values of T and F\npossible_solutions = []\n\nfor T in range(8):  # T can be from 0 to 7\n    F = 7 - T\n    # Check all conditions\n    if (T >= 2 and  # Statement 1\n        F <= 5 and  # Statement 2\n        (T == 5 or F == 7) and  # Statement 5\n        T in prime_numbers and  # Statement 6\n        F in composite_numbers):  # Statement 7\n        possible_solutions.append((T, F))\n\nlen(possible_solutions)\nassistant > It appears that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements simultaneously. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
