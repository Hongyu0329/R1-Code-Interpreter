    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nLet's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then there are either 6 or 7 true statements.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 0 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then there are 0 false statements, meaning all 7 statements are true.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then there are exactly 2 true statements.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then there are exactly 6 true statements.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This is a logical XOR condition between Statement 3 and Statement 4.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (between 0 and 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (between 0 and 7) are 4, 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If Statement 2 is true, then all statements are true, which contradicts Statement 3 and Statement 4. Therefore, Statement 2 must be false.\n\n- If Statement 1 is true, then there are either 6 or 7 true statements. If there are 7 true statements, Statement 2 would be true, which is a contradiction. Therefore, there must be exactly 6 true statements.\n\n- If there are 6 true statements, then Statement 4 is true, and Statement 3 is false. This satisfies Statement 5.\n\n- With 6 true statements, Statement 6 is true because 6 is not a prime number, which is a contradiction. Therefore, Statement 1 must be false.\n\n- If Statement 1 is false, then there are fewer than 6 true statements. The possible numbers of true statements are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n- If there are 2 true statements, Statement 3 is true, and Statement 4 is false. This satisfies Statement 5.\n\n- With 2 true statements, Statement 6 is true because 2 is a prime number.\n\n- With 2 true statements, there are 5 false statements, which is a composite number, satisfying Statement 7.\n\nLet's verify if there are any other possible solutions.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the possible number of true statements and check each scenario\npossible_true_counts = range(8)  # 0 to 7\n\n# Initialize a list to store valid solutions\nvalid_solutions = []\n\nfor true_count in possible_true_counts:\n    false_count = 7 - true_count\n    \n    # Evaluate each statement based on the current true_count\n    statement_1 = (true_count >= 6)\n    statement_2 = (false_count <= 0)\n    statement_3 = (true_count == 2)\n    statement_4 = (false_count == 1)\n    statement_5 = (statement_3 != statement_4)  # XOR condition\n    statement_6 = (true_count in [2, 3, 5, 7])  # Prime numbers\n    statement_7 = (false_count in [4, 6])  # Composite numbers\n    \n    # Check if all conditions are satisfied\n    if not statement_1 and not statement_2 and statement_5 and statement_6 and statement_7:\n        valid_solutions.append(true_count)\n\n# Return the number of valid solutions\nlen(valid_solutions)\nassistant > Upon evaluating all possible scenarios, it turns out that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements simultaneously. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is: <<<0>>>."
