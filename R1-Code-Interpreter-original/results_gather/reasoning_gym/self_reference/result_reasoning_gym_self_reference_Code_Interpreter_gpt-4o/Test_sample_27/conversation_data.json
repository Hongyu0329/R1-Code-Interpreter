    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nLet's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means there must be at least 2 true statements.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 0 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies that all statements must be true, which contradicts Statement 1 (since if all are true, more than 2 are true).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 1 of these 7 statements is true.\"\n   - If this is true, then only one statement is true, which contradicts Statement 1.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This is impossible because if all are false, then Statement 4 itself cannot be false.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means one of them is true, but not both. If Statement 3 is true, then only one statement is true, which contradicts Statement 1. If Statement 4 is true, then all are false, which is impossible.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - Possible prime numbers for the number of true statements are 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - Possible composite numbers for the number of false statements are 4, 6.\n\nLet's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If 2 statements are true, then 5 are false. This satisfies Statement 1, but not Statement 7 (since 5 is not composite).\n- If 3 statements are true, then 4 are false. This satisfies Statement 1, Statement 6, and Statement 7.\n- If 5 statements are true, then 2 are false. This satisfies Statement 1 and Statement 6, but not Statement 7 (since 2 is not composite).\n- If 7 statements are true, then 0 are false. This satisfies Statement 2, but not Statement 1.\n\nThe only scenario that satisfies all conditions is when 3 statements are true and 4 are false. Let's verify:\n\n- Statement 1: True (at least 2 are true).\n- Statement 2: False (not all are true).\n- Statement 3: False (not exactly 1 is true).\n- Statement 4: False (not all are false).\n- Statement 5: False (neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n- Statement 6: True (3 is a prime number).\n- Statement 7: True (4 is a composite number).\n\nThus, there is only one possible solution where 3 statements are true and 4 are false.\n\nThe number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is <<<1>>>."
