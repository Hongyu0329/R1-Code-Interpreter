    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of true statements among the seven given statements. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means the number of true statements \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means the number of false statements \\( F \\leq 1 \\), or equivalently, \\( T \\geq 6 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means \\( T = 5 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means \\( F = 2 \\), or equivalently, \\( T = 5 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This means either \\( T = 5 \\) (Statement 3 is true) or \\( T = 5 \\) (Statement 4 is true), but not both. Since both statements imply \\( T = 5 \\), this statement is always false.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - This means \\( T \\) is a prime number. The possible prime numbers for \\( T \\) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - This means \\( F \\) is a composite number. The possible composite numbers for \\( F \\) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the consistency of these statements for each possible value of \\( T \\) from 0 to 7. We'll check which combinations satisfy all the conditions.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the possible values for T (number of true statements)\npossible_T_values = range(8)\n\n# Define the conditions for each statement\ndef check_conditions(T):\n    F = 7 - T  # Number of false statements\n    \n    # Check each statement\n    statement_1 = (T >= 4)\n    statement_2 = (T >= 6)\n    statement_3 = (T == 5)\n    statement_4 = (T == 5)\n    statement_5 = (statement_3 != statement_4)  # XOR condition\n    statement_6 = (T in [2, 3, 5, 7])  # Prime numbers\n    statement_7 = (F in [4, 6])  # Composite numbers\n    \n    # Count the number of true statements\n    true_statements = sum([statement_1, statement_2, statement_3, statement_4, statement_5, statement_6, statement_7])\n    \n    return true_statements\n\n# Check each possible value of T\npossible_solutions = [T for T in possible_T_values if check_conditions(T) == T]\n\n# Number of possible solutions\nnum_possible_solutions = len(possible_solutions)\nnum_possible_solutions\nassistant > The number of possible solutions is <<<2>>>."
