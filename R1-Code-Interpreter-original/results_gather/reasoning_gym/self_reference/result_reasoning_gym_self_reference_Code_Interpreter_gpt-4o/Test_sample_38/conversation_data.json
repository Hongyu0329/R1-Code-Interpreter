    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of true statements among the seven given statements. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means the number of false statements \\( F \\leq 5 \\), which implies \\( T \\geq 2 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means \\( T = 4 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means \\( F = 3 \\), which implies \\( T = 4 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either \\( T = 4 \\) or \\( F = 3 \\), but not both. However, since both imply \\( T = 4 \\), this statement is false.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - This means \\( T \\) is a prime number.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - This means \\( F \\) is a composite number.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values for \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) that satisfy all these conditions:\n\n- From Statements 1 and 2, we have \\( 2 \\leq T \\leq 7 \\).\n- From Statements 3 and 4, we have \\( T = 4 \\).\n- From Statement 5, we know it is false, so it doesn't affect the solution.\n- From Statement 6, \\( T \\) must be a prime number. The prime numbers between 2 and 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n- From Statement 7, \\( F \\) must be a composite number. The composite numbers between 0 and 5 are 4.\n\nLet's check if \\( T = 4 \\) satisfies all conditions:\n\n- \\( T = 4 \\) satisfies Statement 1 because \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n- \\( T = 4 \\) satisfies Statement 2 because \\( F = 3 \\leq 5 \\).\n- \\( T = 4 \\) satisfies Statement 3 because \\( T = 4 \\).\n- \\( T = 4 \\) satisfies Statement 4 because \\( F = 3 \\).\n- Statement 5 is false, which is consistent with our assumption.\n- \\( T = 4 \\) does not satisfy Statement 6 because 4 is not a prime number.\n- \\( F = 3 \\) does not satisfy Statement 7 because 3 is not a composite number.\n\nSince \\( T = 4 \\) does not satisfy all conditions, let's check other possible values for \\( T \\).\n\nLet's check if \\( T = 5 \\) satisfies all conditions:\n\n- \\( T = 5 \\) satisfies Statement 1 because \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n- \\( T = 5 \\) satisfies Statement 2 because \\( F = 2 \\leq 5 \\).\n- \\( T = 5 \\) does not satisfy Statement 3 because \\( T \\neq 4 \\).\n- \\( T = 5 \\) does not satisfy Statement 4 because \\( F \\neq 3 \\).\n- Statement 5 is false, which is consistent with our assumption.\n- \\( T = 5 \\) satisfies Statement 6 because 5 is a prime number.\n- \\( F = 2 \\) does not satisfy Statement 7 because 2 is not a composite number.\n\nSince \\( T = 5 \\) does not satisfy all conditions, let's check other possible values for \\( T \\).\n\nLet's check if \\( T = 6 \\) satisfies all conditions:\n\n- \\( T = 6 \\) satisfies Statement 1 because \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n- \\( T = 6 \\) satisfies Statement 2 because \\( F = 1 \\leq 5 \\).\n- \\( T = 6 \\) does not satisfy Statement 3 because \\( T \\neq 4 \\).\n- \\( T = 6 \\) does not satisfy Statement 4 because \\( F \\neq 3 \\).\n- Statement 5 is false, which is consistent with our assumption.\n- \\( T = 6 \\) does not satisfy Statement 6 because 6 is not a prime number.\n- \\( F = 1 \\) does not satisfy Statement 7 because 1 is not a composite number.\n\nSince \\( T = 6 \\) does not satisfy all conditions, let's check other possible values for \\( T \\).\n\nLet's check if \\( T = 7 \\) satisfies all conditions:\n\n- \\( T = 7 \\) satisfies Statement 1 because \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n- \\( T = 7 \\) satisfies Statement 2 because \\( F = 0 \\leq 5 \\).\n- \\( T = 7 \\) does not satisfy Statement 3 because \\( T \\neq 4 \\).\n- \\( T = 7 \\) does not satisfy Statement 4 because \\( F \\neq 3 \\).\n- Statement 5 is false, which is consistent with our assumption.\n- \\( T = 7 \\) satisfies Statement 6 because 7 is a prime number.\n- \\( F = 0 \\) does not satisfy Statement 7 because 0 is not a composite number.\n\nSince \\( T = 7 \\) does not satisfy all conditions, let's check other possible values for \\( T \\).\n\nLet's check if \\( T = 3 \\) satisfies all conditions:\n\n- \\( T = 3 \\) does not satisfy Statement 1 because \\( T < 4 \\).\n- \\( T = 3 \\) satisfies Statement 2 because \\( F = 4 \\leq 5 \\).\n- \\( T = 3 \\) does not satisfy Statement 3 because \\( T \\neq 4 \\).\n- \\( T = 3 \\) satisfies Statement 4 because \\( F = 4 \\).\n- Statement 5 is false, which is consistent with our assumption.\n- \\( T = 3 \\) satisfies Statement 6 because 3 is a prime number.\n- \\( F = 4 \\) satisfies Statement 7 because 4 is a composite number.\n\nSince \\( T = 3 \\) satisfies all conditions, it is a possible solution.\n\nNow, let's check if there are any other possible solutions. We have already checked \\( T = 4, 5, 6, 7 \\) and found that they do not satisfy all conditions. Therefore, the only possible solution is \\( T = 3 \\).\n\nThus, there is only one possible solution. The number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
