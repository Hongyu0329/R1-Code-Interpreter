    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of true statements among the seven given statements. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 4 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means the number of false statements \\( F \\leq 4 \\), which implies \\( T \\geq 3 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means \\( T = 5 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means \\( F = 0 \\), which implies \\( T = 7 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either \\( T = 5 \\) or \\( T = 7 \\), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - This means \\( T \\) is a prime number. The prime numbers between 0 and 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - This means \\( F \\) is a composite number. The composite numbers between 0 and 7 are 4, 6, and 8.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values of \\( T \\) and check which satisfy all the conditions:\n\n- \\( T = 4 \\): \n  - Satisfies Statement 1 and 2.\n  - Does not satisfy Statement 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n- \\( T = 5 \\): \n  - Satisfies Statement 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n  - Does not satisfy Statement 4 or 7.\n\n- \\( T = 6 \\): \n  - Satisfies Statement 1 and 2.\n  - Does not satisfy Statement 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n- \\( T = 7 \\): \n  - Satisfies Statement 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6.\n  - Does not satisfy Statement 3 or 7.\n\nLet's check which values of \\( T \\) satisfy all the conditions.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the possible values for T (number of true statements)\npossible_T_values = [4, 5, 6, 7]\n\n# Check which values satisfy all the conditions\nsatisfying_T_values = []\n\nfor T in possible_T_values:\n    F = 7 - T  # Number of false statements\n    \n    # Check each condition\n    condition_1 = (T >= 4)\n    condition_2 = (F <= 4)\n    condition_3 = (T == 5)\n    condition_4 = (T == 7)\n    condition_5 = ((T == 5) != (T == 7))\n    condition_6 = (T in [2, 3, 5, 7])  # Prime numbers\n    condition_7 = (F in [4, 6, 8])     # Composite numbers\n    \n    # Check if all conditions are satisfied\n    if condition_1 and condition_2 and condition_5 and condition_6 and condition_7:\n        satisfying_T_values.append(T)\n\n# Number of possible solutions\nnum_possible_solutions = len(satisfying_T_values)\nnum_possible_solutions\nassistant > After evaluating the conditions, it turns out that there are no values of \\( T \\) (the number of true statements) that satisfy all the given conditions simultaneously. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is: <<<0>>>."
