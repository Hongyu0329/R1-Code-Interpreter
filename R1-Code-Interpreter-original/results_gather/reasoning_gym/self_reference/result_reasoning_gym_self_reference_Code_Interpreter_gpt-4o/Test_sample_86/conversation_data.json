    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of true statements among the seven given statements, such that all the conditions are satisfied. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.\n2. **Statement 2**: At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.\n3. **Statement 3**: Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.\n4. **Statement 4**: Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.\n5. **Statement 5**: Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n6. **Statement 6**: The number of true statements is a prime number.\n7. **Statement 7**: The number of false statements is a composite number.\n\nLet's denote the number of true statements as \\( T \\) and the number of false statements as \\( F \\). We know that \\( T + F = 7 \\).\n\nWe will evaluate each possible value of \\( T \\) from 0 to 7 and check which values satisfy all the conditions.\n\n- **Statement 1** implies \\( T \\geq 2 \\).\n- **Statement 2** implies \\( F \\leq 5 \\), which means \\( T \\geq 2 \\).\n- **Statement 3** implies \\( T = 4 \\).\n- **Statement 4** implies \\( F = 3 \\), which means \\( T = 4 \\).\n- **Statement 5** implies that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This means \\( T = 4 \\) is possible.\n- **Statement 6** implies \\( T \\) is a prime number. The prime numbers between 2 and 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n- **Statement 7** implies \\( F \\) is a composite number. The composite numbers between 0 and 7 are 4, 6, and 8.\n\nLet's evaluate the possible values of \\( T \\) and check which satisfy all conditions.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the possible values for T (number of true statements)\npossible_T_values = range(2, 8)  # T must be at least 2 and at most 7\n\n# Define the conditions\nprime_numbers = {2, 3, 5, 7}\ncomposite_numbers = {4, 6, 8}\n\n# Check each possible value of T\nvalid_T_values = []\nfor T in possible_T_values:\n    F = 7 - T  # Calculate the number of false statements\n    # Check all conditions\n    if (T in prime_numbers) and (F in composite_numbers):\n        valid_T_values.append(T)\n\n# Return the number of valid T values\nlen(valid_T_values)\nassistant > The number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions is <<<1>>>."
