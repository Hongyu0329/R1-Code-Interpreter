    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\nLet's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 4 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n\nLet's evaluate the possible number of true statements (\\(T\\)) and false statements (\\(F\\)):\n\n- The total number of statements is 7, so \\(T + F = 7\\).\n\nNow, let's evaluate each statement:\n\n- **Statement 1**: \\(T \\geq 2\\).\n- **Statement 2**: \\(F \\leq 4\\), which implies \\(T \\geq 3\\).\n- **Statement 3**: \\(T = 5\\).\n- **Statement 4**: \\(F = 7\\), which implies \\(T = 0\\).\n- **Statement 5**: Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This implies either \\(T = 5\\) or \\(T = 0\\).\n- **Statement 6**: \\(T\\) is a prime number. The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n- **Statement 7**: \\(F\\) is a composite number. The composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4, 6, and 8.\n\nLet's evaluate the possible values of \\(T\\) and check which satisfy all the conditions.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Possible values for T (number of true statements) and F (number of false statements)\npossible_T_values = range(8)  # T can be from 0 to 7\nprime_numbers = {2, 3, 5, 7}\ncomposite_numbers = {4, 6, 8}\n\n# Check each possible value of T\npossible_solutions = []\nfor T in possible_T_values:\n    F = 7 - T  # Since T + F = 7\n    \n    # Check all conditions\n    condition_1 = T >= 2\n    condition_2 = F <= 4\n    condition_3 = (T == 5)\n    condition_4 = (F == 7)\n    condition_5 = (condition_3 or condition_4) and not (condition_3 and condition_4)\n    condition_6 = T in prime_numbers\n    condition_7 = F in composite_numbers\n    \n    # If all conditions are satisfied, add to possible solutions\n    if condition_1 and condition_2 and condition_5 and condition_6 and condition_7:\n        possible_solutions.append((T, F))\n\nlen(possible_solutions)\nassistant > It appears that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions simultaneously. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
