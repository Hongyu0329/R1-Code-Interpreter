    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of true statements among the seven given statements. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   - This implies all 7 statements are true. If this statement is true, then all statements must be true.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   - This means there can be 0, 1, or 2 false statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   - This means there are 5 true statements and 2 false statements.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   - This means there are 5 true statements and 2 false statements.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'  \n   - This means one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. If both are true, this statement is false.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'  \n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'  \n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the consistency of these statements:\n\n- If Statement 1 is true, then all statements are true, which contradicts Statement 5 and Statement 7.\n- If Statement 2 is true, then there can be 0, 1, or 2 false statements.\n- If Statement 3 is true, then there are 5 true statements.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then there are 5 true statements.\n- If Statement 5 is true, then either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n- If Statement 6 is true, the number of true statements is a prime number.\n- If Statement 7 is true, the number of false statements is a composite number.\n\nLet's evaluate the possible scenarios for the number of true statements and check for consistency.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Possible number of true statements\npossible_true_counts = [2, 3, 5, 7]  # Prime numbers\n\n# Function to check the consistency of statements\ndef check_statements(true_count):\n    false_count = 7 - true_count\n    \n    # Evaluate each statement\n    statement_1 = (true_count >= 7)\n    statement_2 = (false_count <= 2)\n    statement_3 = (true_count == 5)\n    statement_4 = (false_count == 2)\n    statement_5 = (statement_3 != statement_4)\n    statement_6 = (true_count in [2, 3, 5, 7])\n    statement_7 = (false_count in [4, 6])\n    \n    # Check if the combination of statements is consistent\n    return all([statement_1, statement_2, statement_3, statement_4, statement_5, statement_6, statement_7])\n\n# Check each possible number of true statements\npossible_solutions = [true_count for true_count in possible_true_counts if check_statements(true_count)]\nlen(possible_solutions)\nassistant > It appears that there are no consistent solutions where all the statements can be true simultaneously. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is: <<<0>>>."
