Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements \\( T \\geq 2 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means the number of false statements \\( F \\leq 2 \\), which implies \\( T \\geq 5 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 6 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means \\( T = 6 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means \\( F = 3 \\), which implies \\( T = 4 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either \\( T = 6 \\) or \\( T = 4 \\), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The possible prime numbers for \\( T \\) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The possible composite numbers for \\( F \\) are 4, 6, etc.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values of \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) that satisfy all these conditions:\n\n- From Statement 1, \\( T \\geq 2 \\).\n- From Statement 2, \\( T \\geq 5 \\).\n- From Statement 5, \\( T = 6 \\) or \\( T = 4 \\).\n- From Statement 6, \\( T \\) must be a prime number.\n- From Statement 7, \\( F \\) must be a composite number.\n\nLet's evaluate the possible values of \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) and check which satisfy all conditions.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Possible values for T (number of true statements) and F (number of false statements)\npossible_T_values = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\nprime_numbers = [2, 3, 5, 7]\ncomposite_numbers = [4, 6]\n\n# Check each possible value of T\npossible_solutions = []\nfor T in possible_T_values:\n    F = 7 - T  # Since there are 7 statements in total\n    # Check all conditions\n    if (T >= 2 and T >= 5 and (T == 6 or T == 4) and T in prime_numbers and F in composite_numbers):\n        possible_solutions.append((T, F))\n\nlen(possible_solutions)\nassistant > It seems there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions simultaneously.
