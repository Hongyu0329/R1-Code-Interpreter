    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the truth values of each statement and check for consistency. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.\"  \n   - This implies all statements are true.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.\"  \n   - This implies at least 2 statements are true.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are true.\"  \n   - This implies 3 statements are true.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false.\"  \n   - This implies all statements are false.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"  \n   - This implies one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"  \n   - Possible prime numbers for true statements are 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"  \n   - Possible composite numbers for false statements are 4, 6, or 8.\n\nLet's evaluate the consistency of these statements by considering different numbers of true statements.
