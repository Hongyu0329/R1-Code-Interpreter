    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nLet's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This implies all statements are true.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 7 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies all statements are false.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This implies 5 statements are true and 2 are false.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies 5 statements are true and 2 are false.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This implies one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - Possible prime numbers for the number of true statements are 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - Possible composite numbers for the number of false statements are 4 or 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If Statement 1 is true, then all statements are true, which contradicts Statement 5.\n- If Statement 2 is true, then all statements are false, which contradicts itself.\n- If Statement 3 is true, then there are exactly 5 true statements.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then there are exactly 5 true statements.\n- Statement 5 implies either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n- Statement 6 requires the number of true statements to be a prime number.\n- Statement 7 requires the number of false statements to be a composite number.\n\nLet's evaluate the possible number of true statements:\n\n- **2 true statements**: 5 false statements (composite), satisfies Statement 7, but not Statement 6.\n- **3 true statements**: 4 false statements (composite), satisfies both Statements 6 and 7.\n- **5 true statements**: 2 false statements (not composite), satisfies Statement 6 but not Statement 7.\n- **7 true statements**: 0 false statements (not composite), satisfies Statement 6 but not Statement 7.\n\nThe only scenario that satisfies all conditions is having 3 true statements and 4 false statements.\n\nLet's verify this scenario:\n\n- Statement 1: False (not all are true).\n- Statement 2: True (not all are false).\n- Statement 3: False (not exactly 5 true).\n- Statement 4: False (not exactly 2 false).\n- Statement 5: True (neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n- Statement 6: True (3 is a prime number).\n- Statement 7: True (4 is a composite number).\n\nThis scenario satisfies all conditions. Therefore, there is only one possible solution.\n\nThe number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
