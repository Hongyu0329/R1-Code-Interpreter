    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nLet's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 5 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means the number of true statements \\( T \\geq 5 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means the number of false statements \\( F \\leq 1 \\), which implies \\( T \\geq 6 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means \\( T = 3 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means \\( F = 1 \\), which implies \\( T = 6 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This means either \\( T = 3 \\) or \\( T = 6 \\), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - This means \\( T \\) is a prime number. The possible prime numbers between 0 and 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - This means \\( F \\) is a composite number. The possible composite numbers between 0 and 7 are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the possible values of \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) that satisfy all these conditions. We'll check each possible value of \\( T \\) from 0 to 7 and see if it satisfies all the statements.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the possible values for T (number of true statements) and F (number of false statements)\npossible_T_values = range(8)  # T can be from 0 to 7\nprime_numbers = {2, 3, 5, 7}  # Prime numbers between 0 and 7\ncomposite_numbers = {4, 6}    # Composite numbers between 0 and 7\n\n# Initialize a list to store valid solutions\nvalid_solutions = []\n\n# Check each possible value of T\nfor T in possible_T_values:\n    F = 7 - T  # Calculate the number of false statements\n    \n    # Check the conditions for each statement\n    condition_1 = (T >= 5)\n    condition_2 = (F <= 1)\n    condition_3 = (T == 3)\n    condition_4 = (F == 1)\n    condition_5 = ((T == 3) != (F == 1))  # XOR condition\n    condition_6 = (T in prime_numbers)\n    condition_7 = (F in composite_numbers)\n    \n    # Check if all conditions are satisfied\n    if condition_1 and condition_2 and condition_3 and condition_4 and condition_5 and condition_6 and condition_7:\n        valid_solutions.append((T, F))\n\n# Return the number of valid solutions\nlen(valid_solutions)\nassistant > There are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements simultaneously.
