    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nLet's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements \\( T \\geq 3 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 4 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means the number of false statements \\( F \\leq 4 \\), or equivalently, \\( T \\geq 3 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means \\( T = 7 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means \\( F = 3 \\), or equivalently, \\( T = 4 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either \\( T = 7 \\) or \\( T = 4 \\), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - This means \\( T \\) is a prime number. The prime numbers between 0 and 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - This means \\( F \\) is a composite number. The composite numbers between 0 and 7 are 4, 6, and 8.\n\nNow, let's find the possible values of \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) that satisfy all these conditions:\n\n- From Statements 1 and 2, \\( T \\geq 3 \\).\n- From Statement 5, \\( T = 7 \\) or \\( T = 4 \\).\n- From Statement 6, \\( T \\) must be a prime number.\n- From Statement 7, \\( F \\) must be a composite number.\n\nLet's evaluate the possible values of \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) and check which satisfy all conditions.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Possible values for T and F based on the conditions\nprime_numbers = [2, 3, 5, 7]\ncomposite_numbers = [4, 6, 8]\n\n# Check possible values of T and F\npossible_solutions = []\n\nfor T in range(3, 8 + 1):  # T ranges from 3 to 7\n    F = 7 - T\n    if T in prime_numbers and F in composite_numbers:\n        if (T == 7 or T == 4) and not (T == 7 and T == 4):\n            possible_solutions.append((T, F))\n\nlen(possible_solutions)\nassistant > It appears that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions simultaneously. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is: <<<0>>>."
