    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nLet's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements \\( T \\geq 3 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means the number of false statements \\( F \\leq 1 \\), which implies \\( T \\geq 6 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 6 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means \\( T = 6 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means \\( F = 2 \\), which implies \\( T = 5 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either \\( T = 6 \\) or \\( T = 5 \\), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - Possible prime numbers for \\( T \\) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - Possible composite numbers for \\( F \\) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the possible values for \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) that satisfy all these conditions:\n\n- If \\( T = 6 \\), then \\( F = 1 \\). This satisfies Statement 2, Statement 3, and Statement 5. However, \\( F = 1 \\) is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false.\n\n- If \\( T = 5 \\), then \\( F = 2 \\). This satisfies Statement 4, Statement 5, and Statement 7. However, \\( T = 5 \\) is a prime number, so Statement 6 is true.\n\n- If \\( T = 3 \\), then \\( F = 4 \\). This satisfies Statement 1 and Statement 7. However, it does not satisfy Statement 2, Statement 3, Statement 4, or Statement 5.\n\n- If \\( T = 7 \\), then \\( F = 0 \\). This satisfies Statement 2 and Statement 6. However, \\( F = 0 \\) is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false.\n\nLet's check the possible solutions for \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) that satisfy all conditions.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Possible values for T (number of true statements) and F (number of false statements)\npossible_solutions = []\n\n# Check each possible value of T from 0 to 7\nfor T in range(8):\n    F = 7 - T  # Calculate F based on T\n    \n    # Check conditions for each statement\n    condition1 = (T >= 3)  # Statement 1\n    condition2 = (F <= 1)  # Statement 2\n    condition3 = (T == 6)  # Statement 3\n    condition4 = (F == 2)  # Statement 4\n    condition5 = (condition3 != condition4)  # Statement 5\n    condition6 = (T in [2, 3, 5, 7])  # Statement 6 (prime numbers)\n    condition7 = (F in [4, 6])  # Statement 7 (composite numbers)\n    \n    # Check if all conditions are satisfied\n    if condition1 and condition2 and condition3 and condition4 and condition5 and condition6 and condition7:\n        possible_solutions.append((T, F))\n\nlen(possible_solutions)\nassistant > It appears that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions simultaneously. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is: <<<0>>>."
