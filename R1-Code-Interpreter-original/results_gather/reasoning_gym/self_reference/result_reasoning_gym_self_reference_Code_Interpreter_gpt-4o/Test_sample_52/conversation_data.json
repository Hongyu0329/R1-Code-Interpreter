    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of true statements among the seven given statements. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means the number of true statements \\( T \\geq 3 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means the number of false statements \\( F \\leq 3 \\), which implies \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means \\( T = 4 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means \\( F = 3 \\), which implies \\( T = 4 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This means either \\( T = 4 \\) or \\( F = 3 \\), but not both. However, since both imply \\( T = 4 \\), this statement is contradictory if both are true.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - This means \\( T \\) is a prime number.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - This means \\( F \\) is a composite number.\n\nLet's analyze the possible values for \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) based on these conditions:\n\n- From Statements 1 and 2, we have \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n- From Statements 3 and 4, we have \\( T = 4 \\).\n- From Statement 5, we have a contradiction if both Statements 3 and 4 are true.\n- From Statement 6, \\( T \\) must be a prime number.\n- From Statement 7, \\( F \\) must be a composite number.\n\nLet's check the possible values for \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) that satisfy all these conditions.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Possible values for T (number of true statements) and F (number of false statements)\n# T + F = 7\n\n# Prime numbers less than or equal to 7\nprime_numbers = [2, 3, 5, 7]\n\n# Composite numbers less than or equal to 7\ncomposite_numbers = [4, 6]\n\n# Check possible values for T and F\npossible_solutions = []\n\nfor T in range(8):\n    F = 7 - T\n    if T >= 4 and T in prime_numbers and F in composite_numbers:\n        possible_solutions.append((T, F))\n\npossible_solutions\nassistant > It seems there are no values for \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) that satisfy all the conditions simultaneously. Let's re-evaluate the constraints:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \\( T \\geq 3 \\)\n2. **Statement 2**: \\( T \\geq 4 \\)\n3. **Statement 3**: \\( T = 4 \\)\n4. **Statement 4**: \\( T = 4 \\)\n5. **Statement 5**: Contradiction if both Statements 3 and 4 are true.\n6. **Statement 6**: \\( T \\) is a prime number.\n7. **Statement 7**: \\( F \\) is a composite number.\n\nGiven that Statements 3 and 4 both imply \\( T = 4 \\), and Statement 5 states that only one of them can be true, we have a contradiction if both are true. Therefore, neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 can be true.\n\nLet's reconsider the possible values for \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) without the constraint from Statement 5. We'll check if there are any valid solutions.# Re-evaluate possible values for T and F without the constraint from Statement 5\n\n# Check possible values for T and F again\npossible_solutions = []\n\nfor T in range(8):\n    F = 7 - T\n    if T >= 4 and T in prime_numbers and F in composite_numbers:\n        possible_solutions.append((T, F))\n\npossible_solutions\nassistant > Upon re-evaluation, it appears that there are still no values for \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) that satisfy all the conditions simultaneously. This suggests that the set of statements is inherently contradictory, and there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
