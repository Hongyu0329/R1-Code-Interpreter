    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\nLet's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 5 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This implies that the number of true statements \\( T \\geq 5 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This implies that the number of false statements \\( F \\leq 3 \\), which means \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This implies \\( T = 5 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This implies \\( F = 5 \\), which means \\( T = 2 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This implies that either \\( T = 5 \\) or \\( T = 2 \\), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - This implies \\( T \\) is a prime number. The possible prime numbers for \\( T \\) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - This implies \\( F \\) is a composite number. The possible composite numbers for \\( F \\) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's find the number of possible solutions that satisfy all these conditions. We'll check each possible value of \\( T \\) and see if it satisfies all the statements.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Possible values for T (number of true statements) and F (number of false statements)\npossible_T_values = [2, 3, 5, 7]\npossible_F_values = [4, 6]\n\n# Initialize a counter for the number of possible solutions\npossible_solutions = 0\n\n# Check each possible value of T\nfor T in possible_T_values:\n    F = 7 - T  # Calculate the number of false statements\n    \n    # Check if the current T and F satisfy all the conditions\n    if (T >= 5) and (T >= 4) and ((T == 5) != (T == 2)) and (F in possible_F_values):\n        possible_solutions += 1\n\npossible_solutions\nassistant > After analyzing the conditions and checking each possible value of \\( T \\) (number of true statements), it turns out that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements simultaneously. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is: <<<0>>>."
