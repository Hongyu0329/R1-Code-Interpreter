    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nLet's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.\"  \n   - This implies all 7 statements are true.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.\"  \n   - This implies at least 6 statements are true.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true.\"  \n   - This implies 2 statements are true and 5 are false.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are false.\"  \n   - This implies 3 statements are true and 4 are false.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"  \n   - This implies either Statement 3 is true or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"  \n   - Possible prime numbers for the number of true statements are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"  \n   - Possible composite numbers for the number of false statements are 4, 6, etc.\n\nNow, let's analyze the consistency of these statements:\n\n- If Statement 1 is true, then all statements are true, which contradicts Statements 3, 4, and 5.\n- If Statement 2 is true, then at least 6 statements are true, which contradicts Statements 3 and 4.\n- If Statement 3 is true, then exactly 2 statements are true, which contradicts Statements 1, 2, and 4.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then exactly 3 statements are true, which contradicts Statements 1, 2, and 3.\n- Statement 5 can be true if either Statement 3 or 4 is true, but not both.\n- Statement 6 requires the number of true statements to be a prime number.\n- Statement 7 requires the number of false statements to be a composite number.\n\nLet's evaluate the possible scenarios for the number of true statements and check for consistency with all statements.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the possible number of true statements and check for consistency\nprime_numbers = [2, 3, 5, 7]\ncomposite_numbers = [4, 6]\n\n# Initialize a list to store the number of possible solutions\npossible_solutions = []\n\n# Check each possible number of true statements\nfor true_count in prime_numbers:\n    false_count = 7 - true_count\n    if false_count in composite_numbers:\n        # Check consistency with each statement\n        statement_1 = (true_count >= 7)\n        statement_2 = (true_count >= 6)\n        statement_3 = (true_count == 2)\n        statement_4 = (false_count == 4)\n        statement_5 = (statement_3 != statement_4)\n        statement_6 = (true_count in prime_numbers)\n        statement_7 = (false_count in composite_numbers)\n        \n        # Check if all conditions are satisfied\n        if (statement_1 + statement_2 + statement_3 + statement_4 + statement_5 + statement_6 + statement_7) == true_count:\n            possible_solutions.append(true_count)\n\n# Return the number of possible solutions\nlen(possible_solutions)\nassistant > After evaluating the conditions, it turns out that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements simultaneously.
