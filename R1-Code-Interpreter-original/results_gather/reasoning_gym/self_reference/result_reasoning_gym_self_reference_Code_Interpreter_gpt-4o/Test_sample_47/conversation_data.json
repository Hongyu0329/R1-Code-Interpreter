    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nLet's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 5 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements \\( T \\geq 5 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 4 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means the number of false statements \\( F \\leq 4 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 1 of these 7 statements is true.\"\n   - This means \\( T = 1 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means \\( F = 5 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either Statement 3 is true or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - This means \\( T \\) is a prime number.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - This means \\( F \\) is a composite number.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values for \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) that satisfy all these conditions. We will check each possible value of \\( T \\) from 0 to 7 and see if it satisfies all the statements. \n\nLet's calculate the possible solutions.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the possible values for T (number of true statements) and F (number of false statements)\npossible_solutions = []\n\n# Iterate over possible values of T (0 to 7)\nfor T in range(8):\n    F = 7 - T  # Since there are 7 statements, F = 7 - T\n    \n    # Check the conditions for each statement\n    condition1 = (T >= 5)  # Statement 1\n    condition2 = (F <= 4)  # Statement 2\n    condition3 = (T == 1)  # Statement 3\n    condition4 = (F == 5)  # Statement 4\n    condition5 = (condition3 != condition4)  # Statement 5 (either 3 or 4 is true, but not both)\n    condition6 = (T in [2, 3, 5, 7])  # Statement 6 (T is a prime number)\n    condition7 = (F in [4, 6])  # Statement 7 (F is a composite number)\n    \n    # Check if all conditions are satisfied\n    if condition1 and condition2 and condition5 and condition6 and condition7:\n        possible_solutions.append((T, F))\n\n# Number of possible solutions\nnum_possible_solutions = len(possible_solutions)\nnum_possible_solutions, possible_solutions\nassistant > After evaluating the conditions for each possible number of true statements, it turns out that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements simultaneously.
