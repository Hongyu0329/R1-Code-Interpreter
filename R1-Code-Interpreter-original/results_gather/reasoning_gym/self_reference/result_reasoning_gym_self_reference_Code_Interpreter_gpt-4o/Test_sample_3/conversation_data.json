    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of true statements among the seven given statements. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then there are either 6 or 7 true statements.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 4 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then there are at most 3 false statements, meaning there are at least 4 true statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then there are exactly 5 true statements.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then there are exactly 5 true statements.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means that if Statement 5 is true, then either Statement 3 is true or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If there are 7 true statements, then Statement 1 is true, but Statement 2 is false (since there are 0 false statements), and Statement 6 is true. However, Statement 7 would be false because 0 is not a composite number. This scenario is not possible.\n\n- If there are 6 true statements, then Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 6 is true, and Statement 7 is true (since 1 false statement is not composite). This scenario is not possible.\n\n- If there are 5 true statements, then Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is false (since both 3 and 4 are true), Statement 6 is true, and Statement 7 is true (since 2 false statements is composite). This scenario is possible.\n\n- If there are 4 true statements, then Statement 2 is true, Statement 6 is true, and Statement 7 is true (since 3 false statements is composite). However, Statement 1 would be false, and neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 would be true, making Statement 5 false. This scenario is not possible.\n\n- If there are 3 true statements, then Statement 2 is true, Statement 6 is true, and Statement 7 is true (since 4 false statements is composite). However, Statement 1 would be false, and neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 would be true, making Statement 5 false. This scenario is not possible.\n\n- If there are 2 true statements, then Statement 6 is true, but Statement 7 would be false (since 5 false statements is not composite). This scenario is not possible.\n\n- If there is 1 true statement, then Statement 6 is false, and Statement 7 would be false (since 6 false statements is composite). This scenario is not possible.\n\nFrom the analysis, the only possible scenario is when there are 5 true statements. Let's verify this:\n\n- Statement 1: False (since there are not at least 6 true statements)\n- Statement 2: True (since there are at most 4 false statements)\n- Statement 3: True (since there are exactly 5 true statements)\n- Statement 4: True (since there are exactly 2 false statements)\n- Statement 5: False (since both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true)\n- Statement 6: True (since 5 is a prime number)\n- Statement 7: True (since 2 false statements is composite)\n\nThis scenario satisfies all conditions, and there is only one possible solution. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[\n<<<1>>>\n\\]"
