    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means the number of false statements \\( F \\leq 2 \\), which implies \\( T \\geq 5 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means \\( T = 4 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means \\( F = 0 \\), which implies \\( T = 7 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either \\( T = 4 \\) or \\( T = 7 \\), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The possible prime numbers for \\( T \\) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The possible composite numbers for \\( F \\) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's find the number of possible solutions that satisfy all these conditions. We'll check each possible value of \\( T \\) from 0 to 7 and see if it satisfies all the statements.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the possible values for T (number of true statements) and F (number of false statements)\npossible_T_values = range(8)  # T can be from 0 to 7\nprime_numbers = {2, 3, 5, 7}  # Prime numbers for T\ncomposite_numbers = {4, 6}    # Composite numbers for F\n\n# Initialize a counter for the number of possible solutions\npossible_solutions = 0\n\n# Check each possible value of T\nfor T in possible_T_values:\n    F = 7 - T  # Calculate the number of false statements\n    \n    # Check if the current T and F satisfy all the statements\n    if (T >= 4 and  # Statement 1\n        T >= 5 and  # Statement 2\n        ((T == 4) != (T == 7)) and  # Statement 5 (either T=4 or T=7, but not both)\n        T in prime_numbers and  # Statement 6\n        F in composite_numbers):  # Statement 7\n        possible_solutions += 1\n\npossible_solutions\nassistant > After evaluating all possible scenarios, it turns out that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements simultaneously. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is: <<<0>>>."
