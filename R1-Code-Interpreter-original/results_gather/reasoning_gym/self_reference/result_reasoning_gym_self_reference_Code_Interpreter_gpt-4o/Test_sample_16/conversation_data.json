    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the truth values of each statement and check for consistency. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - If true, then 6 or 7 statements are true.\n   - If false, then 5 or fewer statements are true.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 7 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This statement is always true because there are only 7 statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - If true, then exactly 5 statements are true.\n   - If false, then not exactly 5 statements are true.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - If true, then exactly 2 statements are false (i.e., 5 are true).\n   - If false, then not exactly 2 statements are false.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This is a XOR condition between Statement 3 and Statement 4.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - Possible prime numbers for the number of true statements are 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - Possible composite numbers for the number of false statements are 4 or 6.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the possible scenarios for the number of true statements and check for consistency with all statements. We'll consider each possible number of true statements and verify if it satisfies all conditions.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom sympy import isprime\n\n# Possible number of true statements\npossible_true_counts = [2, 3, 5, 7]\n\n# Possible number of false statements\npossible_false_counts = [4, 6]\n\n# Total number of statements\ntotal_statements = 7\n\n# Function to check if a scenario is consistent\ndef is_consistent(true_count):\n    false_count = total_statements - true_count\n    \n    # Check each statement\n    statement_1 = (true_count >= 6)\n    statement_2 = True  # Always true\n    statement_3 = (true_count == 5)\n    statement_4 = (false_count == 2)\n    statement_5 = (statement_3 != statement_4)  # XOR condition\n    statement_6 = isprime(true_count)\n    statement_7 = (false_count in possible_false_counts)\n    \n    # All statements must be consistent\n    return all([statement_1, statement_2, statement_3, statement_4, statement_5, statement_6, statement_7])\n\n# Check each possible number of true statements\nconsistent_solutions = [true_count for true_count in possible_true_counts if is_consistent(true_count)]\n\n# Number of possible solutions\nnum_possible_solutions = len(consistent_solutions)\nnum_possible_solutions\nassistant > After evaluating the conditions for each possible number of true statements, we find that there are no consistent solutions that satisfy all the given statements.
