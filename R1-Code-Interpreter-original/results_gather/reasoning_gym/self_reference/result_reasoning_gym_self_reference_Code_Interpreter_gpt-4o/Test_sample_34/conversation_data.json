    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means the number of false statements \\( F \\leq 3 \\), which implies \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means \\( T = 2 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means \\( F = 7 \\), which implies \\( T = 0 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either \\( T = 2 \\) or \\( T = 0 \\), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - Possible prime numbers for \\( T \\) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - Possible composite numbers for \\( F \\) are 4, 6, and 8.\n\nNow, let's analyze the consistency of these statements:\n\n- From Statements 1 and 2, we have \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n- From Statement 5, we have either \\( T = 2 \\) or \\( T = 0 \\).\n- From Statement 6, \\( T \\) must be a prime number.\n- From Statement 7, \\( F \\) must be a composite number.\n\nLet's check the possible values of \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) that satisfy all these conditions.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Possible values for T (number of true statements) and F (number of false statements)\npossible_T_values = [0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\nprime_T_values = [2, 3, 5, 7]\ncomposite_F_values = [4, 6, 8]\n\n# Check for possible solutions\npossible_solutions = []\n\nfor T in possible_T_values:\n    F = 7 - T\n    if (T >= 4) and (T in prime_T_values) and (F in composite_F_values):\n        possible_solutions.append((T, F))\n\nlen(possible_solutions)\nassistant > There are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements simultaneously.
