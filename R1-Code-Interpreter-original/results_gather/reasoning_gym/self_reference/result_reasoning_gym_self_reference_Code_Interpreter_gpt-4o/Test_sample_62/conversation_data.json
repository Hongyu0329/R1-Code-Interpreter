    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of true statements among the seven given statements. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means the number of false statements \\( F \\leq 2 \\), or equivalently, \\( T \\geq 5 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means \\( T = 5 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 6 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means \\( F = 6 \\), or equivalently, \\( T = 1 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either \\( T = 5 \\) or \\( T = 1 \\), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - This means \\( T \\) is a prime number (2, 3, 5, 7).\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - This means \\( F \\) is a composite number (4, 6).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the possible values of \\( T \\) and check which statements can be true simultaneously:\n\n- If \\( T = 1 \\):\n  - Statement 4 is true.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since Statement 3 is false).\n  - Statement 6 is false (1 is not a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is false (6 is a composite number, but Statement 4 being true contradicts this).\n\n- If \\( T = 5 \\):\n  - Statement 3 is true.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since Statement 4 is false).\n  - Statement 6 is true (5 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (2 is not a composite number, but 2 false statements make 5 true statements).\n\nLet's check if \\( T = 5 \\) satisfies all conditions:\n\n- Statement 1: True (since \\( T = 5 \\geq 4 \\)).\n- Statement 2: True (since \\( F = 2 \\leq 2 \\)).\n- Statement 3: True (since \\( T = 5 \\)).\n- Statement 4: False (since \\( T \\neq 1 \\)).\n- Statement 5: True (since Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false).\n- Statement 6: True (since 5 is a prime number).\n- Statement 7: True (since 2 is not a composite number, but 2 false statements make 5 true statements).\n\nThus, the only consistent solution is \\( T = 5 \\).\n\nTherefore, there is only one possible solution. The number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
