    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of true statements among the seven given statements. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 6 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means the number of false statements \\( F \\leq 6 \\), which implies \\( T \\geq 1 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means \\( T = 4 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means \\( F = 3 \\), which implies \\( T = 4 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either \\( T = 4 \\) or \\( F = 3 \\), but not both. Since both imply \\( T = 4 \\), this statement is false.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - This means \\( T \\) is a prime number.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - This means \\( F \\) is a composite number.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values of \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) that satisfy all these conditions:\n\n- From Statements 1 and 2, we have \\( 1 \\leq T \\leq 7 \\).\n- From Statement 3, \\( T = 4 \\).\n- From Statement 4, \\( T = 4 \\).\n- From Statement 5, since both Statements 3 and 4 imply \\( T = 4 \\), Statement 5 is false.\n- From Statement 6, \\( T \\) must be a prime number. The prime numbers between 1 and 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n- From Statement 7, \\( F \\) must be a composite number. The composite numbers between 0 and 6 are 4 and 6.\n\nLet's check the possible values of \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) that satisfy all these conditions.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Possible values for T (number of true statements) and F (number of false statements)\npossible_T_values = [2, 3, 4, 5, 7]  # Prime numbers between 1 and 7\npossible_F_values = [4, 6]           # Composite numbers between 0 and 6\n\n# Check which combinations of T and F satisfy all conditions\nsolutions = []\nfor T in possible_T_values:\n    F = 7 - T\n    if F in possible_F_values:\n        solutions.append((T, F))\n\n# Number of possible solutions\nnum_solutions = len(solutions)\nnum_solutions, solutions\nassistant > There is only one possible solution that satisfies all the given conditions: \\( T = 3 \\) (the number of true statements) and \\( F = 4 \\) (the number of false statements).\n\nThus, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{1} \\]\n\nSo, the final answer is: <<<1>>>."
