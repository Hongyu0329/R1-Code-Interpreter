    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of true statements among the seven given statements, such that all the conditions are satisfied. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This implies that the number of true statements \\( T \\geq 2 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 4 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies that the number of false statements \\( F \\leq 4 \\), or equivalently, \\( T \\geq 3 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This implies \\( T = 7 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies \\( F = 3 \\), or equivalently, \\( T = 4 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This implies that either \\( T = 7 \\) or \\( T = 4 \\), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - This implies \\( T \\) is a prime number. The possible prime numbers between 1 and 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - This implies \\( F \\) is a composite number. The possible composite numbers between 1 and 7 are 4, 6, and 8.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the possible values of \\( T \\) that satisfy all these conditions. We'll check each possible value of \\( T \\) from 2 to 7:\n\n- **\\( T = 2 \\)**: \n  - Violates Statement 2 (\\( T \\geq 3 \\)) and Statement 6 (2 is prime, but it doesn't satisfy other conditions).\n\n- **\\( T = 3 \\)**: \n  - Satisfies Statement 1 (\\( T \\geq 2 \\)), Statement 2 (\\( T \\geq 3 \\)), and Statement 6 (3 is prime).\n  - \\( F = 4 \\), which is composite, satisfying Statement 7.\n  - Neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true, satisfying Statement 5.\n\n- **\\( T = 4 \\)**: \n  - Satisfies Statement 1 (\\( T \\geq 2 \\)), Statement 2 (\\( T \\geq 3 \\)), and Statement 4 (\\( T = 4 \\)).\n  - \\( F = 3 \\), which is not composite, violating Statement 7.\n  - Statement 5 is satisfied because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false.\n\n- **\\( T = 5 \\)**: \n  - Satisfies Statement 1 (\\( T \\geq 2 \\)), Statement 2 (\\( T \\geq 3 \\)), and Statement 6 (5 is prime).\n  - \\( F = 2 \\), which is not composite, violating Statement 7.\n  - Neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true, satisfying Statement 5.\n\n- **\\( T = 6 \\)**: \n  - Violates Statement 6 (6 is not prime).\n\n- **\\( T = 7 \\)**: \n  - Satisfies Statement 1 (\\( T \\geq 2 \\)), Statement 2 (\\( T \\geq 3 \\)), and Statement 3 (\\( T = 7 \\)).\n  - \\( F = 0 \\), which is not composite, violating Statement 7.\n  - Statement 5 is satisfied because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false.\n\nFrom this analysis, the only value of \\( T \\) that satisfies all conditions is \\( T = 3 \\).\n\nThus, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
