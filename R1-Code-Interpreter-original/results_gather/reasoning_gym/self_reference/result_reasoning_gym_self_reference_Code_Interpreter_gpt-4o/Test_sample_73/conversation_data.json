    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 5 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements \\( T \\) is \\( T \\geq 5 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 6 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means the number of false statements \\( F \\) is \\( F \\leq 6 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means \\( T = 5 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means \\( F = 2 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either \\( T = 5 \\) or \\( F = 2 \\), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The possible prime numbers for \\( T \\) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The possible composite numbers for \\( F \\) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the constraints:\n\n- From Statement 1, \\( T \\geq 5 \\).\n- From Statement 2, \\( F \\leq 6 \\).\n- From Statement 3, \\( T = 5 \\).\n- From Statement 4, \\( F = 2 \\).\n- From Statement 5, either \\( T = 5 \\) or \\( F = 2 \\), but not both.\n- From Statement 6, \\( T \\) must be a prime number.\n- From Statement 7, \\( F \\) must be a composite number.\n\nLet's find the number of possible solutions that satisfy all these conditions.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Possible values for T and F based on the constraints\npossible_T_values = [5, 6, 7]  # T >= 5\npossible_F_values = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  # F <= 6\n\n# Prime numbers for T\nprime_T_values = [2, 3, 5, 7]\n\n# Composite numbers for F\ncomposite_F_values = [4, 6]\n\n# Check each combination of T and F\npossible_solutions = 0\nfor T in possible_T_values:\n    F = 7 - T  # Since T + F = 7\n    if F in possible_F_values:\n        # Check all conditions\n        if (T in prime_T_values and F in composite_F_values and\n            ((T == 5) != (F == 2))):  # Statement 5 condition\n            possible_solutions += 1\n\npossible_solutions\nassistant > After analyzing the constraints and checking all possible combinations, it turns out that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements simultaneously.
