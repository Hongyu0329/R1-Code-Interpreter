    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\nLet's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements \\( T \\geq 3 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means the number of false statements \\( F \\leq 5 \\), which implies \\( T \\geq 2 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means \\( T = 7 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 1 of these 7 statements is false.\"\n   - This means \\( F = 1 \\), which implies \\( T = 6 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either \\( T = 7 \\) or \\( T = 6 \\), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - This means \\( T \\) is a prime number. The prime numbers between 0 and 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - This means \\( F \\) is a composite number. The composite numbers between 0 and 7 are 4, 6, and 8.\n\nNow, let's find the possible values of \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) that satisfy all these conditions. We'll check each possible value of \\( T \\) from 0 to 7 and see if it satisfies all the statements. \n\nLet's calculate this.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the possible values for T (number of true statements) and F (number of false statements)\npossible_T_values = range(8)  # T can be from 0 to 7\nprime_numbers = {2, 3, 5, 7}  # Prime numbers between 0 and 7\ncomposite_numbers = {4, 6, 8}  # Composite numbers between 0 and 7\n\n# Initialize a list to store valid solutions\nvalid_solutions = []\n\n# Check each possible value of T\nfor T in possible_T_values:\n    F = 7 - T  # Calculate the number of false statements\n    \n    # Check all conditions\n    if (T >= 3 and  # Statement 1\n        T >= 2 and  # Statement 2\n        ((T == 7) != (T == 6)) and  # Statement 5 (either T=7 or T=6, but not both)\n        T in prime_numbers and  # Statement 6\n        F in composite_numbers):  # Statement 7\n        valid_solutions.append(T)\n\n# Number of valid solutions\nnumber_of_solutions = len(valid_solutions)\nnumber_of_solutions, valid_solutions\nassistant > It appears that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements simultaneously. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is: <<<0>>>."
