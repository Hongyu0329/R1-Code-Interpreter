    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of true statements among the seven given statements. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 7 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This is always true because there are only 7 statements, so \\( F \\leq 7 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means \\( T = 4 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means \\( F = 3 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either \\( T = 4 \\) or \\( F = 3 \\), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - This means \\( T \\) is a prime number.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - This means \\( F \\) is a composite number.\n\nLet's analyze the possible values for \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) that satisfy all these conditions. We'll check each possible value of \\( T \\) from 0 to 7 and see if it satisfies all the statements. \n\nWe'll calculate the number of possible solutions.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the possible values for T (number of true statements) and F (number of false statements)\npossible_solutions = []\n\n# Check each possible value of T from 0 to 7\nfor T in range(8):\n    F = 7 - T  # Since there are 7 statements, F = 7 - T\n    \n    # Check the conditions for each statement\n    condition1 = (T >= 4)  # Statement 1\n    condition2 = (F <= 7)  # Statement 2 (always true)\n    condition3 = (T == 4)  # Statement 3\n    condition4 = (F == 3)  # Statement 4\n    condition5 = (condition3 != condition4)  # Statement 5\n    condition6 = (T in [2, 3, 5, 7])  # Statement 6 (prime numbers)\n    condition7 = (F in [4, 6])  # Statement 7 (composite numbers)\n    \n    # Check if all conditions are satisfied\n    if condition1 and condition2 and condition5 and condition6 and condition7:\n        possible_solutions.append((T, F))\n\n# Number of possible solutions\nnum_possible_solutions = len(possible_solutions)\nnum_possible_solutions, possible_solutions\nassistant > There are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements simultaneously.
