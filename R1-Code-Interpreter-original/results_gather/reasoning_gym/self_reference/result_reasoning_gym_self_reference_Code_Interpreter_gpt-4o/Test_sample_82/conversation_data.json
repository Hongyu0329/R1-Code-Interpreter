    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of true statements among the seven given statements, considering the conditions provided by each statement. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements \\( T \\geq 3 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means the number of false statements \\( F \\leq 2 \\), which implies \\( T \\geq 5 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 6 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means \\( T = 6 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 1 of these 7 statements is false.\"\n   - This means \\( F = 1 \\), which implies \\( T = 6 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either \\( T = 6 \\) (from Statement 3) or \\( T = 6 \\) (from Statement 4), but not both. However, both statements imply the same condition, so this statement is always true if \\( T = 6 \\).\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. So, \\( T \\) could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6. So, \\( F \\) could be 4 or 6, which implies \\( T = 3 \\) or \\( T = 1 \\).\n\nNow, let's find the consistent number of true statements \\( T \\) that satisfy all these conditions. We'll check each possible value of \\( T \\) from 0 to 7.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the possible values for T (number of true statements)\npossible_T_values = range(8)\n\n# Define the conditions for each statement\ndef check_conditions(T):\n    F = 7 - T  # Number of false statements\n    \n    # Check each statement's condition\n    cond1 = T >= 3\n    cond2 = F <= 2\n    cond3 = T == 6\n    cond4 = F == 1\n    cond5 = (T == 6)  # Since both statements 3 and 4 imply T = 6, this is always true if T = 6\n    cond6 = T in [2, 3, 5, 7]  # Prime numbers\n    cond7 = F in [4, 6]  # Composite numbers\n    \n    # Check if all conditions are satisfied\n    return cond1 and cond2 and cond3 and cond4 and cond5 and cond6 and cond7\n\n# Find the number of possible solutions\npossible_solutions = sum(check_conditions(T) for T in possible_T_values)\npossible_solutions\nassistant > After evaluating the conditions for each possible number of true statements, it turns out that there are no consistent solutions that satisfy all the given statements simultaneously. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is: <<<0>>>."
