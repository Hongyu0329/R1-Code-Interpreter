    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nLet's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements \\( T \\geq 3 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means the number of false statements \\( F \\leq 1 \\), which implies \\( T \\geq 6 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means \\( T = 3 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means \\( F = 5 \\), which implies \\( T = 2 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either \\( T = 3 \\) or \\( T = 2 \\), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - This means \\( T \\) is a prime number. The possible prime numbers for \\( T \\) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - This means \\( F \\) is a composite number. The possible composite numbers for \\( F \\) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the possible values of \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) that satisfy all these conditions. We'll check each possible value of \\( T \\) and see if it satisfies all the statements.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Possible values for T (number of true statements) and F (number of false statements)\npossible_T_values = [2, 3, 5, 7]\npossible_F_values = [4, 6]\n\n# Function to check if a given T and F satisfy all the statements\ndef check_statements(T, F):\n    # Statement 1: At least 3 of these 7 statements are true\n    if T < 3:\n        return False\n    # Statement 2: At most 1 of these 7 statements are false\n    if F > 1:\n        return False\n    # Statement 3: Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are true\n    statement_3 = (T == 3)\n    # Statement 4: Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are false\n    statement_4 = (F == 5)\n    # Statement 5: Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both\n    if not (statement_3 ^ statement_4):\n        return False\n    # Statement 6: The number of true statements is a prime number\n    if T not in possible_T_values:\n        return False\n    # Statement 7: The number of false statements is a composite number\n    if F not in possible_F_values:\n        return False\n    return True\n\n# Check all possible combinations of T and F\npossible_solutions = 0\nfor T in range(8):  # T can be from 0 to 7\n    F = 7 - T\n    if check_statements(T, F):\n        possible_solutions += 1\n\npossible_solutions\nassistant > After evaluating all possible combinations of true and false statements, it turns out that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.
