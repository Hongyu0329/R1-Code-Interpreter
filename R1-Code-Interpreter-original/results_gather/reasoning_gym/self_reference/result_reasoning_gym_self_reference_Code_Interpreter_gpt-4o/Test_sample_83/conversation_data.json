    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of true statements among the seven given statements. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 4 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means the number of false statements \\( F \\leq 4 \\), which implies \\( T \\geq 3 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means \\( T = 2 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means \\( F = 7 \\), which implies \\( T = 0 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either \\( T = 2 \\) or \\( T = 0 \\), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - This means \\( T \\) is a prime number (2, 3, 5, 7).\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - This means \\( F \\) is a composite number (4, 6).\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values of \\( T \\) and check the consistency of all statements:\n\n- If \\( T = 0 \\):\n  - Statement 4 is true, which makes Statement 5 false.\n  - Statement 6 is false (0 is not prime).\n  - Statement 7 is false (7 is not composite).\n  - This is inconsistent because Statement 5 requires either Statement 3 or 4 to be true, but not both.\n\n- If \\( T = 2 \\):\n  - Statement 3 is true, which makes Statement 5 true.\n  - Statement 6 is true (2 is prime).\n  - Statement 7 is false (5 is not composite).\n  - This is consistent with Statement 5.\n\n- If \\( T = 3 \\):\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is true.\n  - Statement 6 is true (3 is prime).\n  - Statement 7 is true (4 is composite).\n  - This is consistent.\n\n- If \\( T = 4 \\):\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is true.\n  - Statement 6 is false (4 is not prime).\n  - Statement 7 is true (3 is composite).\n  - This is inconsistent because Statement 6 is false.\n\n- If \\( T = 5 \\):\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is false.\n  - Statement 6 is true (5 is prime).\n  - Statement 7 is true (2 is composite).\n  - This is inconsistent because Statement 2 is false.\n\n- If \\( T = 6 \\):\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is false.\n  - Statement 6 is false (6 is not prime).\n  - Statement 7 is false (1 is not composite).\n  - This is inconsistent because both Statements 2 and 6 are false.\n\n- If \\( T = 7 \\):\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is false.\n  - Statement 6 is false (7 is not prime).\n  - Statement 7 is false (0 is not composite).\n  - This is inconsistent because both Statements 2 and 6 are false.\n\nFrom this analysis, the consistent solutions are when \\( T = 2 \\) and \\( T = 3 \\). Let's count the number of possible solutions.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Possible values of T that are consistent with the statements\npossible_T_values = [2, 3]\n\n# Count the number of possible solutions\nnumber_of_possible_solutions = len(possible_T_values)\nnumber_of_possible_solutions\nassistant > The number of possible solutions is <<<2>>>."
