    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of true statements among the seven given statements, considering the conditions provided by each statement.\n\nLet's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements \\( T \\geq 3 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 7 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This is always true because there are only 7 statements, so \\( F \\leq 7 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means \\( T = 2 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means \\( F = 2 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either \\( T = 2 \\) or \\( F = 2 \\), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - This means \\( T \\) is a prime number (2, 3, 5, 7).\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - This means \\( F \\) is a composite number (4, 6).\n\nNow, let's evaluate the possible values for \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) that satisfy all these conditions:\n\n- Since there are 7 statements, \\( T + F = 7 \\).\n- From Statement 1, \\( T \\geq 3 \\).\n- From Statement 6, \\( T \\) must be a prime number.\n- From Statement 7, \\( F \\) must be a composite number.\n\nLet's check the possible values for \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) that satisfy these conditions.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Possible values for T (number of true statements) and F (number of false statements)\n# T must be a prime number and F must be a composite number\n# T + F = 7\n\n# Prime numbers less than or equal to 7\nprime_numbers = [2, 3, 5, 7]\n\n# Composite numbers less than or equal to 7\ncomposite_numbers = [4, 6]\n\n# Check possible values for T and F\npossible_solutions = []\nfor T in prime_numbers:\n    F = 7 - T\n    if F in composite_numbers:\n        possible_solutions.append((T, F))\n\npossible_solutions\nassistant > The only possible solution that satisfies all the conditions is when there are 3 true statements and 4 false statements. This satisfies:\n\n- Statement 1: At least 3 statements are true.\n- Statement 5: Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both (since neither is true in this case).\n- Statement 6: The number of true statements (3) is a prime number.\n- Statement 7: The number of false statements (4) is a composite number.\n\nThus, there is only one possible solution.\n\nThe number of possible solutions is: <<<1>>>."
