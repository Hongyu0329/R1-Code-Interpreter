    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nLet's denote the number of true statements as \\( T \\) and the number of false statements as \\( F \\). Since there are 7 statements in total, we have:\n\n\\[ T + F = 7 \\]\n\nNow, let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   This implies \\( T \\geq 6 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   This implies \\( F \\leq 3 \\), which is equivalent to \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.'  \n   This implies \\( T = 4 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.'  \n   This implies \\( F = 3 \\), which is equivalent to \\( T = 4 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'  \n   This implies that either \\( T = 4 \\) or \\( F = 3 \\), but not both simultaneously.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'  \n   This implies \\( T \\) is a prime number. The possible prime numbers for \\( T \\) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'  \n   This implies \\( F \\) is a composite number. The possible composite numbers for \\( F \\) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's find the values of \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) that satisfy all these conditions. We'll check each possible value of \\( T \\) and see if it satisfies all the statements.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Possible values for T and F\npossible_T_values = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\npossible_F_values = [7 - T for T in possible_T_values]\n\n# Check each possible value of T and F\nsolutions = []\nfor T, F in zip(possible_T_values, possible_F_values):\n    # Check conditions for each statement\n    cond1 = (T >= 6)  # Statement 1\n    cond2 = (F <= 3)  # Statement 2\n    cond3 = (T == 4)  # Statement 3\n    cond4 = (F == 3)  # Statement 4\n    cond5 = (cond3 != cond4)  # Statement 5\n    cond6 = (T in [2, 3, 5, 7])  # Statement 6\n    cond7 = (F in [4, 6])  # Statement 7\n    \n    # Check if all conditions are satisfied\n    if cond1 and cond2 and cond5 and cond6 and cond7:\n        solutions.append((T, F))\n\n# Number of possible solutions\nnum_solutions = len(solutions)\nnum_solutions, solutions\nassistant > It appears that there are no values of \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) that satisfy all the given conditions simultaneously. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
