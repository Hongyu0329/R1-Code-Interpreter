    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nLet's evaluate each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then there are at least 6 true statements.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 4 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then there are at most 3 false statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then there are exactly 5 true statements.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This statement cannot be true because it would contradict itself (if it were true, then it would be false).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This statement implies that one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Since Statement 4 cannot be true, Statement 3 must be true.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (out of 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (out of 7) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If Statement 3 is true, then there are exactly 5 true statements.\n- If there are 5 true statements, then there are 2 false statements.\n- Check if this satisfies all other conditions.\n\nLet's verify this scenario: \n\n- Statement 1: False (since there are not at least 6 true statements)\n- Statement 2: True (since there are at most 3 false statements)\n- Statement 3: True (since there are exactly 5 true statements)\n- Statement 4: False (since not all statements are false)\n- Statement 5: True (since Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false)\n- Statement 6: True (since 5 is a prime number)\n- Statement 7: False (since 2 is not a composite number)\n\nNow, let's check if there are any other possible scenarios that satisfy all conditions. \n\n- If there are 7 true statements, then Statement 4 would be false, contradicting itself.\n- If there are 6 true statements, then Statement 1 would be true, but Statement 3 would be false, contradicting Statement 5.\n- If there are 4 true statements, then Statement 3 would be false, contradicting Statement 5.\n- If there are 3 true statements, then Statement 6 would be false, contradicting the prime number condition.\n- If there are 2 true statements, then Statement 6 would be false, contradicting the prime number condition.\n- If there is 1 true statement, then Statement 6 would be false, contradicting the prime number condition.\n- If there are 0 true statements, then Statement 4 would be true, contradicting itself.\n\nThus, the only possible scenario is when there are exactly 5 true statements. Therefore, there is only one possible solution.\n\nThe number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
