    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements \\( T \\geq 3 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means the number of false statements \\( F \\leq 3 \\), which implies \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means \\( T = 7 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means \\( F = 2 \\), which implies \\( T = 5 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either \\( T = 7 \\) or \\( T = 5 \\), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The possible prime numbers for \\( T \\) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The possible composite numbers for \\( F \\) are 4, 6, etc.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values of \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) that satisfy all these conditions:\n\n- From Statements 1 and 2, we have \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n- From Statement 5, we have \\( T = 5 \\) or \\( T = 7 \\).\n- From Statement 6, \\( T \\) must be a prime number, so \\( T = 5 \\) or \\( T = 7 \\).\n- From Statement 7, \\( F \\) must be a composite number. Since \\( F = 7 - T \\), we need to check if \\( 7 - T \\) is composite.\n\nLet's evaluate the possible values of \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) to find the number of solutions.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Possible values for T based on the analysis\npossible_T_values = [5, 7]\n\n# Check which values of T satisfy all conditions\nsolutions = []\nfor T in possible_T_values:\n    F = 7 - T\n    # Check if F is a composite number\n    if F > 1 and any(F % i == 0 for i in range(2, F)):\n        solutions.append((T, F))\n\n# Number of possible solutions\nnum_solutions = len(solutions)\nnum_solutions\nassistant > Upon evaluating the conditions, it turns out there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements simultaneously. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is: <<<0>>>."
