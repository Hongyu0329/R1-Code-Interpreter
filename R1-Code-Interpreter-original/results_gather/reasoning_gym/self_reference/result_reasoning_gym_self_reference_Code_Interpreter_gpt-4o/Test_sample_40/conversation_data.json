    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy the truthfulness of the given statements. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This implies that there are either 6 or 7 true statements.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies that there are at most 2 true statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This implies that there are exactly 2 true statements.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies that there are exactly 5 true statements.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This implies that either Statement 3 is true (2 true statements) or Statement 4 is true (5 true statements), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - This implies that the number of true statements can be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - This implies that the number of false statements can be 4, 6, or 8.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If Statement 1 is true, then there are 6 or 7 true statements. However, this contradicts Statement 2, which implies at most 2 true statements. Therefore, Statement 1 must be false.\n\n- If Statement 2 is true, then there are at most 2 true statements. This aligns with Statement 3 being true (exactly 2 true statements).\n\n- If Statement 3 is true, then there are exactly 2 true statements. This aligns with Statement 2 being true.\n\n- If Statement 4 is true, then there are exactly 5 true statements. This contradicts Statement 3, which implies exactly 2 true statements. Therefore, Statement 4 must be false.\n\n- If Statement 5 is true, then either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Since Statement 4 is false, Statement 3 must be true.\n\n- If Statement 6 is true, then the number of true statements is a prime number. Since Statement 3 is true, there are exactly 2 true statements, which is a prime number.\n\n- If Statement 7 is true, then the number of false statements is a composite number. With 2 true statements, there are 5 false statements, which is not a composite number. Therefore, Statement 7 must be false.\n\nLet's summarize the truth values of the statements:\n\n- Statement 1: False\n- Statement 2: True\n- Statement 3: True\n- Statement 4: False\n- Statement 5: True\n- Statement 6: True\n- Statement 7: False\n\nNow, let's count the number of true statements and false statements:\n\n- True statements: 4 (Statements 2, 3, 5, and 6)\n- False statements: 3 (Statements 1, 4, and 7)\n\nThis scenario satisfies all the conditions. Let's verify if there are any other possible solutions. \n\n- If we assume a different number of true statements, it would contradict the conditions set by the statements. For example, having 5 true statements would contradict Statement 3, and having 3 true statements would contradict Statement 5.\n\nTherefore, there is only one possible solution that satisfies all the conditions. \n\nThe number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
