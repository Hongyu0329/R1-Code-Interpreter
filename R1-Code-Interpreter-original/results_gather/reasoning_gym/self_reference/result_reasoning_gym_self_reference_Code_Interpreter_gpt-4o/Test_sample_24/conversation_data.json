    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of true statements among the seven given statements. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 5 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements \\( T \\geq 5 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means the number of false statements \\( F \\leq 5 \\), which implies \\( T \\geq 2 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means \\( T = 5 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means \\( F = 2 \\), which implies \\( T = 5 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either \\( T = 5 \\) or \\( F = 2 \\), but not both. Since both imply \\( T = 5 \\), this statement is false.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - This means \\( T \\) is a prime number.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - This means \\( F \\) is a composite number.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the possible values of \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) that satisfy all these conditions:\n\n- From Statements 1 and 2, we have \\( 2 \\leq T \\leq 7 \\).\n- From Statements 3 and 4, we have \\( T = 5 \\).\n- From Statement 5, we know it is false, so it doesn't affect the solution.\n- From Statement 6, \\( T \\) must be a prime number. The prime numbers between 2 and 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n- From Statement 7, \\( F \\) must be a composite number. The composite numbers between 0 and 5 are 4.\n\nLet's check which values of \\( T \\) satisfy all these conditions:\n\n- \\( T = 5 \\): \n  - \\( F = 7 - 5 = 2 \\), which is not composite. So, this does not satisfy Statement 7.\n\n- \\( T = 3 \\):\n  - \\( F = 7 - 3 = 4 \\), which is composite. This satisfies all conditions.\n\n- \\( T = 7 \\):\n  - \\( F = 7 - 7 = 0 \\), which is not composite. So, this does not satisfy Statement 7.\n\n- \\( T = 2 \\):\n  - \\( F = 7 - 2 = 5 \\), which is not composite. So, this does not satisfy Statement 7.\n\nThus, the only value of \\( T \\) that satisfies all conditions is \\( T = 3 \\).\n\nLet's confirm this solution:\n\n- Statement 1: False (since \\( T = 3 \\) and not \\( \\geq 5 \\)).\n- Statement 2: True (since \\( F = 4 \\leq 5 \\)).\n- Statement 3: False (since \\( T \\neq 5 \\)).\n- Statement 4: False (since \\( F \\neq 2 \\)).\n- Statement 5: True (since both Statements 3 and 4 are false).\n- Statement 6: True (since 3 is a prime number).\n- Statement 7: True (since 4 is a composite number).\n\nTherefore, there is only one possible solution where \\( T = 3 \\).\n\nThe number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
