    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of true statements among the seven given statements. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.\"  \n   - This implies all statements are true. If this statement is true, then all statements must be true, which is a contradiction because not all statements can be true (e.g., Statement 5). Therefore, Statement 1 is false.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"  \n   - This means that at least 5 statements are true. If this statement is true, then the number of true statements is 5, 6, or 7.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.\"  \n   - If this statement is true, then exactly 5 statements are true.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"  \n   - If this statement is true, then exactly 5 statements are true (since 7 - 2 = 5).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"  \n   - This means that either exactly 5 statements are true (Statement 3) or exactly 2 statements are false (Statement 4), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"  \n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"  \n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If exactly 5 statements are true:\n  - Statement 3 is true.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both).\n  - Statement 6 is true (since 5 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is false (since 2 false statements is not a composite number).\n\n- If exactly 6 statements are true:\n  - Statement 2 is true.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is false (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is false (since 6 is not a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (since 1 false statement is not a composite number).\n\n- If exactly 7 statements are true:\n  - This is not possible because Statement 1 would be true, which contradicts the other statements.\n\nLet's check the consistency of these scenarios and count the number of possible solutions.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the possible number of true statements and check each scenario\npossible_true_counts = [5, 6]\n\n# Initialize a list to store valid solutions\nvalid_solutions = []\n\n# Check each possible number of true statements\nfor true_count in possible_true_counts:\n    # Calculate the number of false statements\n    false_count = 7 - true_count\n    \n    # Check the conditions for each statement\n    statement_1 = (true_count >= 7)\n    statement_2 = (false_count <= 2)\n    statement_3 = (true_count == 5)\n    statement_4 = (false_count == 2)\n    statement_5 = (statement_3 != statement_4)\n    statement_6 = (true_count in [2, 3, 5, 7])  # Prime numbers\n    statement_7 = (false_count in [4, 6])  # Composite numbers\n    \n    # Check if the scenario is consistent\n    if (statement_1 == False and\n        statement_2 == True and\n        statement_5 == True and\n        statement_6 == (true_count == 5) and\n        statement_7 == (false_count == 6)):\n        valid_solutions.append(true_count)\n\n# Count the number of valid solutions\nnum_solutions = len(valid_solutions)\nnum_solutions\nassistant > It seems there was an oversight in the analysis.
