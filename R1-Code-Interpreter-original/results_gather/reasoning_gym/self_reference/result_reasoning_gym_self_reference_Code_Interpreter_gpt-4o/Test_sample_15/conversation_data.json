    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of true statements among the seven given statements, considering the conditions provided by each statement. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements \\( T \\geq 2 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means the number of false statements \\( F \\leq 3 \\), or equivalently, \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means \\( T = 5 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means \\( F = 2 \\), or equivalently, \\( T = 5 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either \\( T = 5 \\) (from Statement 3) or \\( T = 5 \\) (from Statement 4), but not both. However, since both statements imply \\( T = 5 \\), this condition is satisfied if \\( T = 5 \\).\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - This means \\( T \\) is a prime number. The possible prime numbers for \\( T \\) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - This means \\( F \\) is a composite number. The possible composite numbers for \\( F \\) are 4, 6, and 8.\n\nNow, let's find the number of possible solutions by checking the consistency of these conditions. We'll evaluate the possible values of \\( T \\) and check if they satisfy all the conditions.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Possible values for T (number of true statements) and F (number of false statements)\npossible_T_values = [2, 3, 5, 7]\npossible_F_values = [4, 6, 8]\n\n# Check each possible value of T\npossible_solutions = 0\nfor T in possible_T_values:\n    F = 7 - T  # Calculate the number of false statements\n    # Check if the conditions are satisfied\n    if (T >= 2 and T >= 4 and T == 5 and F in possible_F_values):\n        possible_solutions += 1\n\npossible_solutions\nassistant > It seems there was an error in my initial analysis. Let's re-evaluate the conditions:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \\( T \\geq 2 \\)\n2. **Statement 2**: \\( T \\geq 4 \\)\n3. **Statement 3**: \\( T = 5 \\)\n4. **Statement 4**: \\( T = 5 \\)\n5. **Statement 5**: This is satisfied if \\( T = 5 \\) because both Statements 3 and 4 imply \\( T = 5 \\).\n6. **Statement 6**: \\( T \\) is a prime number (2, 3, 5, 7)\n7. **Statement 7**: \\( F \\) is a composite number (4, 6, 8)\n\nGiven these conditions, the only value that satisfies all conditions is \\( T = 5 \\) and \\( F = 2 \\). Let's verify this:\n\n- \\( T = 5 \\) satisfies Statement 1 (\\( T \\geq 2 \\)), Statement 2 (\\( T \\geq 4 \\)), Statement 3 (\\( T = 5 \\)), Statement 4 (\\( T = 5 \\)), and Statement 5 (either Statement 3 or 4 is true, but not both).\n- \\( T = 5 \\) is a prime number, satisfying Statement 6.\n- \\( F = 2 \\) is not a composite number, which contradicts Statement 7.\n\nTherefore, there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions. The number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is: <<<0>>>."
