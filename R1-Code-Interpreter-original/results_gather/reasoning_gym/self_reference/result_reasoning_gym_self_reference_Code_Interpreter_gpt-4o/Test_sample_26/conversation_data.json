    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nLet's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 1 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means that not all statements can be false.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means that at least 4 statements must be true.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This is a specific condition that can be true or false.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This is another specific condition that can be true or false.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This means that either exactly 5 statements are true or exactly 4 statements are false, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (out of 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (out of 7) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the possible scenarios:\n\n- If exactly 5 statements are true:\n  - Statement 3 is true.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since either Statement 3 or 4 is true, but not both).\n  - Statement 6 is true (5 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is false (2 false statements is not a composite number).\n\n- If exactly 4 statements are true:\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is true.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since either Statement 3 or 4 is true, but not both).\n  - Statement 6 is false (4 is not a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (3 false statements is not a composite number).\n\nLet's check if there are any other possible scenarios that satisfy all conditions. We'll evaluate the number of true statements from 0 to 7 and check which scenarios are valid.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the possible number of true statements and check each scenario\npossible_solutions = []\n\n# Iterate over the number of true statements from 0 to 7\nfor true_statements in range(8):\n    false_statements = 7 - true_statements\n    \n    # Check each statement's condition\n    statement_1 = true_statements >= 1\n    statement_2 = false_statements <= 3\n    statement_3 = true_statements == 5\n    statement_4 = false_statements == 4\n    statement_5 = (statement_3 or statement_4) and not (statement_3 and statement_4)\n    statement_6 = true_statements in [2, 3, 5, 7]  # Prime numbers\n    statement_7 = false_statements in [4, 6]  # Composite numbers\n    \n    # Check if all conditions are satisfied\n    if all([statement_1, statement_2, statement_5, statement_6, statement_7]):\n        possible_solutions.append(true_statements)\n\n# Return the number of possible solutions\nlen(possible_solutions)\nassistant > After evaluating all possible scenarios, it turns out that there are no solutions that satisfy all the given conditions simultaneously. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{0} \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is: <<<0>>>."
