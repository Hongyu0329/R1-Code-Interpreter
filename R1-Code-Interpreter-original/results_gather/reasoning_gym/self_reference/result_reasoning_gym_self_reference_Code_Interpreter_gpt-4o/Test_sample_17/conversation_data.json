    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means the number of false statements \\( F \\leq 3 \\), which implies \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means \\( T = 0 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means \\( F = 2 \\), which implies \\( T = 5 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either \\( T = 0 \\) or \\( T = 5 \\), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The possible prime numbers for \\( T \\) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The possible composite numbers for \\( F \\) are 4, 6, and 8.\n\nNow, let's find the number of possible solutions that satisfy all these conditions. We'll check each possible value of \\( T \\) from 0 to 7 and see if it satisfies all the statements.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the possible values for T (number of true statements) and F (number of false statements)\npossible_T_values = range(8)  # T can be from 0 to 7\nprime_numbers = {2, 3, 5, 7}  # Prime numbers for T\ncomposite_numbers = {4, 6, 8}  # Composite numbers for F\n\n# Initialize a list to store valid solutions\nvalid_solutions = []\n\n# Check each possible value of T\nfor T in possible_T_values:\n    F = 7 - T  # Calculate the number of false statements\n    \n    # Check all conditions\n    condition_1 = T >= 4\n    condition_2 = F <= 3\n    condition_3 = (T == 0)\n    condition_4 = (F == 2)\n    condition_5 = (condition_3 or condition_4) and not (condition_3 and condition_4)\n    condition_6 = T in prime_numbers\n    condition_7 = F in composite_numbers\n    \n    # If all conditions are satisfied, add to valid solutions\n    if condition_1 and condition_2 and condition_5 and condition_6 and condition_7:\n        valid_solutions.append(T)\n\n# Number of possible solutions\nnum_possible_solutions = len(valid_solutions)\nnum_possible_solutions\nassistant > After evaluating all the conditions, it turns out that there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements simultaneously.
