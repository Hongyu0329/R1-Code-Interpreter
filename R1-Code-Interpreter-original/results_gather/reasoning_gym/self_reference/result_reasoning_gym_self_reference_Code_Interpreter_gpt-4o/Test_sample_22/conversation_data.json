    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of true statements among the seven given statements. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.\"  \n   - This implies all 7 statements are true. If this statement is true, then all statements must be true, which is a contradiction because not all statements can be true (e.g., Statement 4 cannot be true if all are true). Therefore, Statement 1 is false.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"  \n   - This means there are at least 5 true statements. If this statement is true, then there are 5, 6, or 7 true statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"  \n   - This is a direct statement about the number of true statements.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are false.\"  \n   - This is a direct statement about the number of false statements, implying 2 true statements.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"  \n   - This is a logical XOR condition between Statements 3 and 4.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"  \n   - Possible prime numbers for the number of true statements are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"  \n   - Possible composite numbers for the number of false statements are 4, 6, and 8.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the consistency of these statements for each possible number of true statements (from 0 to 7):\n\n- **0 true statements**: Contradicts Statement 1 and 2.\n- **1 true statement**: Contradicts Statement 2.\n- **2 true statements**: \n  - Statement 4 is true, so Statement 3 must be false (satisfies Statement 5).\n  - Number of true statements (2) is prime (satisfies Statement 6).\n  - Number of false statements (5) is composite (satisfies Statement 7).\n  - Statement 2 is false (since more than 2 statements are false).\n- **3 true statements**: \n  - Contradicts Statement 6 (3 is prime, but Statement 6 would be false if 3 is true).\n- **4 true statements**: \n  - Statement 3 is true, so Statement 4 must be false (satisfies Statement 5).\n  - Number of true statements (4) is not prime (contradicts Statement 6).\n- **5 true statements**: \n  - Contradicts Statement 4.\n- **6 true statements**: \n  - Contradicts Statement 4.\n- **7 true statements**: \n  - Contradicts Statement 1.\n\nThe only consistent scenario is when there are 2 true statements. Let's verify:\n\n- Statement 4 is true, so Statement 3 is false (satisfies Statement 5).\n- Number of true statements (2) is prime (satisfies Statement 6).\n- Number of false statements (5) is composite (satisfies Statement 7).\n- Statement 2 is false (since more than 2 statements are false).\n\nThus, there is only one possible solution where 2 statements are true. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
