    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of true statements among the seven given statements. Let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This implies that the number of true statements \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies that the number of false statements \\( F \\leq 3 \\), which means \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This implies \\( T = 4 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies \\( F = 3 \\), which means \\( T = 4 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This implies that either \\( T = 4 \\) or \\( F = 3 \\), but not both. Since both imply the same condition, this statement is false.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - This implies \\( T \\) is a prime number.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - This implies \\( F \\) is a composite number.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values for \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) based on these conditions:\n\n- From Statements 1 and 2, we have \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n- From Statements 3 and 4, we have \\( T = 4 \\).\n- From Statement 5, we know it is false, so it doesn't affect the count.\n- From Statement 6, \\( T \\) must be a prime number.\n- From Statement 7, \\( F \\) must be a composite number.\n\nLet's check the possible values for \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) that satisfy all these conditions.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Possible values for T (number of true statements) and F (number of false statements)\n# T + F = 7\n\n# Prime numbers less than or equal to 7\nprime_numbers = [2, 3, 5, 7]\n\n# Composite numbers less than or equal to 7\ncomposite_numbers = [4, 6]\n\n# Check possible values for T and F\npossible_solutions = []\n\nfor T in range(4, 8):  # T must be at least 4\n    F = 7 - T\n    if T in prime_numbers and F in composite_numbers:\n        possible_solutions.append((T, F))\n\npossible_solutions\nassistant > It seems there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's verify the constraints again:\n\n1. \\( T \\geq 4 \\) from Statements 1 and 2.\n2. \\( T = 4 \\) from Statements 3 and 4.\n3. Statement 5 is false, so it doesn't affect the count.\n4. \\( T \\) must be a prime number from Statement 6.\n5. \\( F \\) must be a composite number from Statement 7.\n\nGiven these constraints, let's re-evaluate the possible values for \\( T \\) and \\( F \\):\n\n- If \\( T = 4 \\), then \\( F = 3 \\). However, 3 is not a composite number, so this doesn't satisfy Statement 7.\n- If \\( T = 5 \\), then \\( F = 2 \\). But 2 is not a composite number, so this doesn't satisfy Statement 7.\n- If \\( T = 6 \\), then \\( F = 1 \\). But 1 is not a composite number, so this doesn't satisfy Statement 7.\n- If \\( T = 7 \\), then \\( F = 0 \\). But 0 is not a composite number, so this doesn't satisfy Statement 7.\n\nIt appears that there are no values of \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) that satisfy all the conditions simultaneously. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n<<<0>>>\n\\]"
