    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's go through each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1: 'At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - If this statement is true, then there are either 6 or 7 true statements.\n\n2. **Statement 2: 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - If this statement is true, then there are at most 5 false statements, meaning there are at least 2 true statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - If this statement is true, then there are exactly 3 true statements.\n\n4. **Statement 4: 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - If this statement is true, then there are exactly 6 true statements.\n\n5. **Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'**\n   - This means either Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false, or Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false.\n\n6. **Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'**\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (out of 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'**\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (out of 7) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1: 6 true statements, 1 false statement**\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 4 is true (since exactly 1 statement is false).\n  - Statement 5 is true (since Statement 4 is true, Statement 3 must be false).\n  - Statement 6 is true (6 is not a prime number, so this scenario is not possible).\n  - Statement 7 is false (1 is not a composite number).\n\n- **Scenario 2: 7 true statements, 0 false statements**\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is true.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is false (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is false (7 is a prime number, so this scenario is possible).\n  - Statement 7 is false (0 is not a composite number).\n\n- **Scenario 3: 5 true statements, 2 false statements**\n  - Statement 1 is false.\n  - Statement 2 is true.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is false (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is true (5 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (2 is not a composite number, so this scenario is not possible).\n\n- **Scenario 4: 3 true statements, 4 false statements**\n  - Statement 1 is false.\n  - Statement 2 is true.\n  - Statement 3 is true.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 must be false).\n  - Statement 6 is true (3 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (4 is a composite number).\n\n- **Scenario 5: 2 true statements, 5 false statements**\n  - Statement 1 is false.\n  - Statement 2 is true.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is false (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is true (2 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is false (5 is not a composite number).\n\nFrom the analysis, the only scenario that satisfies all conditions is Scenario 4, where there are 3 true statements and 4 false statements.\n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
