    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This implies that the number of true statements (T) is at least 2.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies that the number of false statements (F) is at most 3, so T ≥ 4.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This implies T = 4.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies F = 3, which means T = 4.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This implies that either T = 4 (Statement 3 is true) or F = 3 (Statement 4 is true), but not both simultaneously. However, since both conditions imply T = 4, this statement is inherently contradictory if both are true.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. Since T ≥ 4 (from Statement 2), the possible values for T are 5 or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6. Since F ≤ 3 (from Statement 2), this statement can only be true if F = 4, which contradicts Statement 2.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If T = 4, then F = 3. This satisfies Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4, but contradicts Statement 5 (since both Statements 3 and 4 would be true), and Statement 6 (since 4 is not a prime number).\n\n- If T = 5, then F = 2. This satisfies Statements 1, 2, and 6. Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, and Statement 5 is true (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true). Statement 7 is false because 2 is not a composite number.\n\n- If T = 7, then F = 0. This satisfies Statements 1, 2, and 6. Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, and Statement 5 is true (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true). Statement 7 is false because 0 is not a composite number.\n\nThe only consistent scenario is when T = 5, which satisfies the maximum number of statements without contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
