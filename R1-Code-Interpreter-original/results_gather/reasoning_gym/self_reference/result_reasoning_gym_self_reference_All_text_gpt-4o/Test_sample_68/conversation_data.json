    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\n1. **Statement 1: 'At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - If this statement is true, then there are either 6 or 7 true statements.\n\n2. **Statement 2: 'At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - If this statement is true, then there are either 0 or 1 false statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3: 'Exactly 6 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - If this statement is true, then there are exactly 6 true statements.\n\n4. **Statement 4: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - If this statement is true, then there are exactly 2 true statements.\n\n5. **Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'**\n   - This statement implies that either Statement 3 is true or Statement 4 is true, but not both simultaneously.\n\n6. **Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'**\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (out of 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'**\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (out of 7) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1: 7 true statements**\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is false (since it says at most 1 false).\n  - Statement 3 is false (since it says exactly 6 true).\n  - Statement 4 is false (since it says exactly 5 false).\n  - Statement 5 is false (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is true (7 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is false (0 false statements, 0 is not composite).\n  - This scenario is not possible because Statement 7 would be false.\n\n- **Scenario 2: 6 true statements**\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is true (since 1 false).\n  - Statement 3 is true (since exactly 6 true).\n  - Statement 4 is false (since it says exactly 5 false).\n  - Statement 5 is true (since Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false).\n  - Statement 6 is true (6 is not a prime number, so this is false).\n  - Statement 7 is true (1 false statement, 1 is not composite).\n  - This scenario is not possible because Statement 6 would be false.\n\n- **Scenario 3: 5 true statements**\n  - Statement 1 is false (since it says at least 6 true).\n  - Statement 2 is false (since it says at most 1 false).\n  - Statement 3 is false (since it says exactly 6 true).\n  - Statement 4 is false (since it says exactly 5 false).\n  - Statement 5 is false (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is true (5 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (2 false statements, 2 is not composite).\n  - This scenario is not possible because Statement 7 would be false.\n\n- **Scenario 4: 4 true statements**\n  - Statement 1 is false (since it says at least 6 true).\n  - Statement 2 is false (since it says at most 1 false).\n  - Statement 3 is false (since it says exactly 6 true).\n  - Statement 4 is false (since it says exactly 5 false).\n  - Statement 5 is false (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is false (4 is not a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (3 false statements, 3 is not composite).\n  - This scenario is not possible because Statement 7 would be false.\n\n- **Scenario 5: 3 true statements**\n  - Statement 1 is false (since it says at least 6 true).\n  - Statement 2 is false (since it says at most 1 false).\n  - Statement 3 is false (since it says exactly 6 true).\n  - Statement 4 is false (since it says exactly 5 false).\n  - Statement 5 is false (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is true (3 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (4 false statements, 4 is composite).\n  - This scenario is possible.\n\n- **Scenario 6: 2 true statements**\n  - Statement 1 is false (since it says at least 6 true).\n  - Statement 2 is false (since it says at most 1 false).\n  - Statement 3 is false (since it says exactly 6 true).\n  - Statement 4 is true (since it says exactly 5 false).\n  - Statement 5 is true (since Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false).\n  - Statement 6 is false (2 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (5 false statements, 5 is not composite).\n  - This scenario is not possible because Statement 7 would be false.\n\n- **Scenario 7: 1 true statement**\n  - Statement 1 is false (since it says at least 6 true).\n  - Statement 2 is true (since it says at most 1 false).\n  - Statement 3 is false (since it says exactly 6 true).\n  - Statement 4 is false (since it says exactly 5 false).\n  - Statement 5 is false (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is false (1 is not a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is false (6 false statements, 6 is composite).\n  - This scenario is not possible because Statement 7 would be false.\n\nAfter analyzing all scenarios, the only possible scenario is Scenario 5, where there are 3 true statements.\n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
