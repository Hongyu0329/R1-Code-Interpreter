    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement and determine the number of true and false statements that satisfy all conditions.\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This implies that the number of true statements (T) is 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This implies that the number of false statements (F) is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.\n   - Since there are 7 statements, T = 7 - F, so T can be 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This implies T = 4.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This implies F = 7, which is impossible because there are only 7 statements, and if all are false, there can't be any true statements.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - Since Statement 4 cannot be true (as shown above), Statement 3 must be true.\n   - Therefore, T = 4.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - T = 4 is not a prime number, so Statement 6 is false.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - If T = 4, then F = 7 - 4 = 3, which is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false.\n\nNow, let's verify the consistency of these statements:\n\n- If T = 4, then Statements 1, 2, and 3 are true.\n- Statement 4 is false because F cannot be 7.\n- Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 6 is false because 4 is not a prime number.\n- Statement 7 is false because 3 is not a composite number.\n\nThus, the true statements are 1, 2, 3, and 5, and the false statements are 4, 6, and 7.\n\nThe number of true statements is 4, which satisfies all the conditions given in the problem.\n\nTherefore, there is only one possible solution where the number of true statements is 4.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
