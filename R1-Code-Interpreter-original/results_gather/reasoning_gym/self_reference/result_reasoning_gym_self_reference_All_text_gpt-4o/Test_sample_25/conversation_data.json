    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements (T) is 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 4 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means the number of false statements (F) is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means T = 5.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means F = 0, which implies T = 7.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either T = 5 or T = 7, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The prime numbers between 0 and 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The composite numbers between 0 and 7 are 4, 6, and 8.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **If T = 5**: \n  - Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since either Statement 3 or 4 is true, but not both).\n  - Statement 6 is true (5 is a prime number).\n  - F = 2 (since 7 - 5 = 2), which is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false.\n  - This scenario satisfies all conditions except Statement 7.\n\n- **If T = 7**:\n  - Statement 4 is true, Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since either Statement 3 or 4 is true, but not both).\n  - Statement 6 is false (7 is a prime number, but Statement 6 requires a composite number of false statements).\n  - F = 0 (since 7 - 7 = 0), which is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false.\n  - This scenario satisfies all conditions except Statement 6 and 7.\n\n- **If T = 4**:\n  - Statement 1 is true (since at least 4 statements are true).\n  - Statement 2 is true (since at most 4 statements are false).\n  - Statement 3 is false (since exactly 5 statements are not true).\n  - Statement 4 is false (since exactly 0 statements are not false).\n  - Statement 5 is false (since neither Statement 3 nor 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is false (4 is not a prime number).\n  - F = 3 (since 7 - 4 = 3), which is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false.\n  - This scenario does not satisfy the conditions.\n\n- **If T = 6**:\n  - Statement 1 is true (since at least 4 statements are true).\n  - Statement 2 is true (since at most 4 statements are false).\n  - Statement 3 is false (since exactly 5 statements are not true).\n  - Statement 4 is false (since exactly 0 statements are not false).\n  - Statement 5 is false (since neither Statement 3 nor 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is true (6 is not a prime number).\n  - F = 1 (since 7 - 6 = 1), which is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false.\n  - This scenario does not satisfy the conditions.\n\nAfter analyzing all possible scenarios, the only scenario that satisfies the maximum number of conditions is when T = 5. However, it does not satisfy Statement 7. Therefore, there are no scenarios that satisfy all conditions.\n\nThus, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
