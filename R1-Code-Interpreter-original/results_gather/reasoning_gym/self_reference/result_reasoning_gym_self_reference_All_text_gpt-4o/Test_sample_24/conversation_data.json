    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\n1. **Statement 1: 'At least 5 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - This implies that the number of true statements (T) is 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2: 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - This implies that the number of false statements (F) is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n3. **Statement 3: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - This implies T = 5.\n\n4. **Statement 4: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - This implies F = 2, which means T = 5.\n\n5. **Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'**\n   - This implies that either T = 5 (Statement 3 is true) or F = 2 (Statement 4 is true), but not both simultaneously.\n\n6. **Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'**\n   - The prime numbers between 0 and 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. So, T could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'**\n   - The composite numbers between 0 and 7 are 4, 6, and 8. So, F could be 4, 6, or 8.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **If T = 5:**\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is true.\n  - Statement 3 is true.\n  - Statement 4 is false (since F = 2 is not true).\n  - Statement 5 is false (since both Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot be true).\n  - Statement 6 is true (5 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is false (2 is not a composite number).\n\n- **If T = 6:**\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is true.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is false (6 is not a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (1 is not a composite number).\n\n- **If T = 7:**\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is false.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is true (7 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is false (0 is not a composite number).\n\nFrom the above analysis, the only consistent scenario is when T = 5, where all conditions are satisfied. Therefore, there is only one possible solution.\n\nThe number of possible solutions is:\n<<<1>>>"
