    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement and determine the number of true and false statements that satisfy all conditions. Let's go through each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements (T) is 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means the number of false statements (F) is 0 or 1, which implies T is 6 or 7.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means T = 3.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means F = 5, which implies T = 2.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either T = 3 or T = 2, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The prime numbers between 0 and 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The composite numbers between 0 and 7 are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **If T = 2**: \n  - Statement 4 is true, and Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is true because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 6 is false because 2 is a prime number.\n  - Statement 7 is false because 5 is not a composite number.\n  - This scenario does not satisfy all conditions because Statement 7 is false.\n\n- **If T = 3**:\n  - Statement 3 is true, and Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 6 is true because 3 is a prime number.\n  - Statement 7 is true because 4 is a composite number.\n  - This scenario satisfies all conditions.\n\n- **If T = 5**:\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is false because F = 2.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is false because neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true.\n  - Statement 6 is true because 5 is a prime number.\n  - Statement 7 is false because 2 is not a composite number.\n  - This scenario does not satisfy all conditions because Statement 7 is false.\n\n- **If T = 6**:\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is true because F = 1.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is false because neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true.\n  - Statement 6 is false because 6 is not a prime number.\n  - Statement 7 is true because 1 is not a composite number.\n  - This scenario does not satisfy all conditions because Statement 6 is false.\n\n- **If T = 7**:\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is true because F = 0.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is false because neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true.\n  - Statement 6 is false because 7 is a prime number.\n  - Statement 7 is false because 0 is not a composite number.\n  - This scenario does not satisfy all conditions because Statement 6 is false.\n\nThe only scenario that satisfies all conditions is when T = 3. Therefore, there is only one possible solution.\n\nThe number of possible solutions is: <<<1>>>."
