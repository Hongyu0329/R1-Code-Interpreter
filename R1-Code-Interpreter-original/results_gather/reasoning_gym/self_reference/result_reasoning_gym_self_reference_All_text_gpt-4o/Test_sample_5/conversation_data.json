    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's go through each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 1 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This implies that not all statements can be false. There must be at least one true statement.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 7 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This is trivially true because there are only 7 statements. It doesn't add any new information.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means that 3 statements are false.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means that 4 statements are true.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This implies that either exactly 4 statements are true (and 3 are false) or exactly 3 statements are false (and 4 are true), but not both conditions can be true simultaneously.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (out of 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (out of 7) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1**: 4 statements are true, and 3 are false.\n  - This satisfies Statement 3 and Statement 4, but Statement 5 says only one of them can be true. Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\n- **Scenario 2**: 3 statements are true, and 4 are false.\n  - This satisfies Statement 4 and Statement 5 (since Statement 3 is false).\n  - The number of true statements (3) is a prime number, satisfying Statement 6.\n  - The number of false statements (4) is a composite number, satisfying Statement 7.\n  - This scenario satisfies all conditions.\n\n- **Scenario 3**: 5 statements are true, and 2 are false.\n  - This does not satisfy Statement 3 or Statement 4, so it violates Statement 5.\n  - Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\n- **Scenario 4**: 2 statements are true, and 5 are false.\n  - This does not satisfy Statement 3 or Statement 4, so it violates Statement 5.\n  - Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\n- **Scenario 5**: 6 statements are true, and 1 is false.\n  - This does not satisfy Statement 3 or Statement 4, so it violates Statement 5.\n  - Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\n- **Scenario 6**: 7 statements are true, and 0 are false.\n  - This does not satisfy Statement 3 or Statement 4, so it violates Statement 5.\n  - Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\nAfter analyzing all possible scenarios, only Scenario 2 satisfies all the conditions. Therefore, there is only one possible solution.\n\nThe number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
