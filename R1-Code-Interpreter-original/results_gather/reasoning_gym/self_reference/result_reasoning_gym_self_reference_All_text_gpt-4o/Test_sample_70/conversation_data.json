    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\n1. **Statement 1: 'At least 5 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - This implies that the number of true statements (T) is 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2: 'At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - This implies that the number of false statements (F) is 0 or 1, which means T is 6 or 7.\n\n3. **Statement 3: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - This implies T = 5.\n\n4. **Statement 4: 'Exactly 6 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - This implies F = 6, which means T = 1.\n\n5. **Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'**\n   - This means one of the following must be true:\n     - Statement 3 is true (T = 5) and Statement 4 is false (T ≠ 1).\n     - Statement 4 is true (T = 1) and Statement 3 is false (T ≠ 5).\n\n6. **Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'**\n   - The possible prime numbers for T are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'**\n   - The possible composite numbers for F are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **If T = 7:**\n  - F = 0, which is not a composite number. So, this scenario is not possible.\n\n- **If T = 6:**\n  - F = 1, which is not a composite number. So, this scenario is not possible.\n\n- **If T = 5:**\n  - F = 2, which is not a composite number. So, this scenario is not possible.\n\n- **If T = 4:**\n  - F = 3, which is not a composite number. So, this scenario is not possible.\n\n- **If T = 3:**\n  - F = 4, which is a composite number. This satisfies Statement 7.\n  - Statement 6 is satisfied because 3 is a prime number.\n  - Statement 1 is false because T is not at least 5.\n  - Statement 2 is false because F is not at most 1.\n  - Statement 3 is false because T is not exactly 5.\n  - Statement 4 is false because F is not exactly 6.\n  - Statement 5 is true because both Statements 3 and 4 are false, satisfying the \"either-or\" condition.\n\n- **If T = 2:**\n  - F = 5, which is not a composite number. So, this scenario is not possible.\n\n- **If T = 1:**\n  - F = 6, which is a composite number. This satisfies Statement 7.\n  - Statement 6 is false because 1 is not a prime number.\n  - Statement 1 is false because T is not at least 5.\n  - Statement 2 is false because F is not at most 1.\n  - Statement 3 is false because T is not exactly 5.\n  - Statement 4 is true because F is exactly 6.\n  - Statement 5 is true because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false, satisfying the \"either-or\" condition.\n\nFrom the analysis, there are two possible solutions: T = 3 and T = 1.\n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
