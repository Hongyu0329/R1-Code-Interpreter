    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\n1. **Statement 1: 'At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - If this statement is true, then there are either 6 or 7 true statements.\n\n2. **Statement 2: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - If this statement is true, then there are 0, 1, 2, or 3 false statements, which means there are 4, 5, 6, or 7 true statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - If this statement is true, then there are exactly 4 true statements.\n\n4. **Statement 4: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - If this statement is true, then there are exactly 4 true statements (since 7 - 3 = 4).\n\n5. **Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'**\n   - This means one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. If Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 is false, and vice versa.\n\n6. **Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'**\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (from 0 to 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'**\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (from 0 to 7) are 4, 6, and 8.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **If there are 7 true statements:**\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is true.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is false (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is true (7 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is false (0 false statements is not a composite number).\n  - This scenario is not possible because Statement 7 would be false.\n\n- **If there are 6 true statements:**\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is true.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is false (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is true (6 is not a prime number, so this is false).\n  - Statement 7 is true (1 false statement is not a composite number, so this is false).\n  - This scenario is not possible because Statement 6 would be false.\n\n- **If there are 5 true statements:**\n  - Statement 1 is false.\n  - Statement 2 is true.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false).\n  - Statement 6 is true (5 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (2 false statements is not a composite number, so this is false).\n  - This scenario is not possible because Statement 7 would be false.\n\n- **If there are 4 true statements:**\n  - Statement 1 is false.\n  - Statement 2 is true.\n  - Statement 3 is true.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false).\n  - Statement 6 is false (4 is not a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (3 false statements is a composite number).\n  - This scenario is possible.\n\n- **If there are 3 true statements:**\n  - Statement 1 is false.\n  - Statement 2 is true.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is true.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is true (3 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is false (4 false statements is a composite number).\n  - This scenario is not possible because Statement 7 would be false.\n\n- **If there are 2 true statements:**\n  - Statement 1 is false.\n  - Statement 2 is true.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is false (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is true (2 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (5 false statements is not a composite number, so this is false).\n  - This scenario is not possible because Statement 7 would be false.\n\n- **If there is 1 true statement:**\n  - Statement 1 is false.\n  - Statement 2 is false.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is false (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is false (1 is not a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (6 false statements is a composite number).\n  - This scenario is not possible because Statement 6 would be false.\n\n- **If there are 0 true statements:**\n  - Statement 1 is false.\n  - Statement 2 is false.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is false (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is false (0 is not a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is false (7 false statements is not a composite number).\n  - This scenario is not possible because Statement 7 would be false.\n\nAfter analyzing all possible scenarios, the only scenario that satisfies all conditions is when there are 4 true statements. Therefore, there is only one possible solution.\n\nThe number of possible solutions is: <<<1>>>."
