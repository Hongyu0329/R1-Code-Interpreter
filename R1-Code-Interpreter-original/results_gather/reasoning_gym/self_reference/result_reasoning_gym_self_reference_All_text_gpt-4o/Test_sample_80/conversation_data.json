    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all conditions. Let's go through each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then there are either 6 or 7 true statements.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 4 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then there are 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 false statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then there are exactly 4 true statements.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then there are exactly 4 true statements (since 7 - 3 = 4).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. If both are false, then neither can be true.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (out of 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (out of 7) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If Statement 1 is true, then there are 6 or 7 true statements.\n  - If there are 7 true statements, then all statements are true, which contradicts Statement 5 (since both Statements 3 and 4 would be false).\n  - If there are 6 true statements, then 1 statement is false. This contradicts Statement 7, as 1 is not a composite number.\n\n- If Statement 1 is false, then there are fewer than 6 true statements.\n  - This means there are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 true statements.\n\n- If Statement 2 is true, then there are 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 false statements.\n  - This means there are 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 true statements.\n\n- If Statement 3 is true, then there are exactly 4 true statements.\n  - This satisfies Statement 5 if Statement 4 is false.\n\n- If Statement 4 is true, then there are exactly 4 true statements.\n  - This satisfies Statement 5 if Statement 3 is false.\n\n- If Statement 6 is true, then the number of true statements is a prime number (2, 3, 5, or 7).\n\n- If Statement 7 is true, then the number of false statements is a composite number (4 or 6).\n\nLet's check the possible number of true statements:\n\n- **4 true statements**: \n  - This satisfies Statement 3 or Statement 4, but not both, which satisfies Statement 5.\n  - 4 is not a prime number, so Statement 6 is false.\n  - 3 false statements (7 - 4 = 3) is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false.\n  - This scenario does not satisfy all conditions.\n\n- **5 true statements**:\n  - This does not satisfy Statement 3 or Statement 4, so Statement 5 is false.\n  - 5 is a prime number, so Statement 6 is true.\n  - 2 false statements (7 - 5 = 2) is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false.\n  - This scenario does not satisfy all conditions.\n\n- **6 true statements**:\n  - This does not satisfy Statement 3 or Statement 4, so Statement 5 is false.\n  - 6 is not a prime number, so Statement 6 is false.\n  - 1 false statement (7 - 6 = 1) is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false.\n  - This scenario does not satisfy all conditions.\n\n- **7 true statements**:\n  - This satisfies Statement 1.\n  - This does not satisfy Statement 3 or Statement 4, so Statement 5 is false.\n  - 7 is a prime number, so Statement 6 is true.\n  - 0 false statements (7 - 7 = 0) is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false.\n  - This scenario does not satisfy all conditions.\n\nAfter analyzing all possible scenarios, we find that none of them satisfy all the conditions simultaneously. Therefore, there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0>>>"
