    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's go through each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements, \\( T \\), must be \\( T \\geq 2 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 4 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means the number of false statements, \\( F \\), must be \\( F \\leq 4 \\).\n   - Since there are 7 statements in total, \\( T + F = 7 \\). Therefore, \\( T \\geq 3 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This implies \\( T = 4 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies \\( F = 3 \\), which means \\( T = 4 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either \\( T = 4 \\) (Statement 3 is true) or \\( F = 3 \\) (Statement 4 is true), but not both simultaneously.\n   - Since both conditions imply \\( T = 4 \\), Statement 5 is false if both are true.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The possible values for \\( T \\) are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n   - The prime numbers in this range are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The possible values for \\( F \\) are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n   - The composite numbers in this range are 4, 6, and 8.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values for \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) that satisfy all conditions:\n\n- **If \\( T = 2 \\):**\n  - \\( F = 5 \\), which does not satisfy Statement 2 (\\( F \\leq 4 \\)).\n\n- **If \\( T = 3 \\):**\n  - \\( F = 4 \\), which satisfies Statement 2.\n  - Statement 6 is true (3 is prime).\n  - Statement 7 is false (4 is composite).\n  - Statement 5 is false (neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n\n- **If \\( T = 4 \\):**\n  - \\( F = 3 \\), which satisfies Statement 2.\n  - Statement 3 is true.\n  - Statement 4 is true.\n  - Statement 5 is false (both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true).\n  - Statement 6 is false (4 is not prime).\n  - Statement 7 is true (3 is not composite).\n\n- **If \\( T = 5 \\):**\n  - \\( F = 2 \\), which satisfies Statement 2.\n  - Statement 6 is true (5 is prime).\n  - Statement 7 is false (2 is not composite).\n  - Statement 5 is false (neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n\n- **If \\( T = 6 \\):**\n  - \\( F = 1 \\), which satisfies Statement 2.\n  - Statement 6 is false (6 is not prime).\n  - Statement 7 is true (1 is not composite).\n  - Statement 5 is false (neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n\n- **If \\( T = 7 \\):**\n  - \\( F = 0 \\), which satisfies Statement 2.\n  - Statement 6 is true (7 is prime).\n  - Statement 7 is false (0 is not composite).\n  - Statement 5 is false (neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n\nFrom the analysis, the only possible solution that satisfies all conditions is when \\( T = 3 \\) and \\( F = 4 \\).\n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
