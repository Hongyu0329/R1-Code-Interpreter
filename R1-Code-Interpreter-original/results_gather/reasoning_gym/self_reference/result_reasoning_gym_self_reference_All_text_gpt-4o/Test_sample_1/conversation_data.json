    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's go through each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then there are either 6 or 7 true statements.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 7 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This statement is trivially true because there are only 7 statements, so at most 7 can be false.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then there are exactly 5 true statements.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then there are exactly 5 true statements (since 7 - 2 = 5).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either Statement 3 is true (5 true statements) or Statement 4 is true (5 true statements), but not both. However, both statements imply the same number of true statements, so this statement cannot be true.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (from 0 to 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (from 0 to 7) are 4, 6, and 8.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If Statement 1 is true, then there are at least 6 true statements. This means there are either 6 or 7 true statements.\n- If there are 7 true statements, then all statements are true, which contradicts Statement 5 (since it cannot be true if all statements are true).\n- If there are 6 true statements, then 1 statement is false. This contradicts Statement 7, as 1 is not a composite number.\n\n- If Statement 1 is false, then there are fewer than 6 true statements. This means there are 5 or fewer true statements.\n- If there are 5 true statements, then Statements 3 and 4 are both true, which contradicts Statement 5.\n- If there are 4 true statements, then there are 3 false statements, which is not a composite number, contradicting Statement 7.\n- If there are 3 true statements, then there are 4 false statements, which is a composite number. This satisfies Statement 7, but contradicts Statement 6, as 3 is a prime number.\n- If there are 2 true statements, then there are 5 false statements, which is not a composite number, contradicting Statement 7.\n- If there is 1 true statement, then there are 6 false statements, which is a composite number. This satisfies Statement 7, but contradicts Statement 6, as 1 is not a prime number.\n- If there are 0 true statements, then there are 7 false statements, which is not a composite number, contradicting Statement 7.\n\nAfter analyzing all possibilities, we find that there is no consistent solution that satisfies all the given statements. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
