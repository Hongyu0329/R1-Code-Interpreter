    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's evaluate each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 1 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This implies that not all statements can be false. At least one statement must be true.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means that there can be 0, 1, 2, or 3 false statements, which implies there can be 7, 6, 5, or 4 true statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 6 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then there are exactly 6 true statements and 1 false statement.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then there are exactly 3 false statements and 4 true statements.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means that either Statement 3 is true or Statement 4 is true, but they cannot both be true simultaneously.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (from 0 to 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (from 0 to 7) are 4, 6, and 8.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1**: Assume Statement 3 is true.\n  - If Statement 3 is true, then there are 6 true statements and 1 false statement.\n  - This contradicts Statement 6, as 6 is not a prime number.\n  - Therefore, Statement 3 cannot be true.\n\n- **Scenario 2**: Assume Statement 4 is true.\n  - If Statement 4 is true, then there are 4 true statements and 3 false statements.\n  - This satisfies Statement 6, as 4 is not a prime number, but it contradicts Statement 6.\n  - Therefore, Statement 4 cannot be true.\n\nSince neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 can be true, Statement 5 cannot be satisfied, as it requires one of them to be true. Therefore, we need to find a scenario where neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true, and the other conditions are satisfied.\n\n- **Scenario 3**: Assume 2 statements are true.\n  - This satisfies Statement 6, as 2 is a prime number.\n  - This means 5 statements are false, which contradicts Statement 2.\n  - Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\n- **Scenario 4**: Assume 3 statements are true.\n  - This satisfies Statement 6, as 3 is a prime number.\n  - This means 4 statements are false, which satisfies Statement 7, as 4 is a composite number.\n  - This scenario satisfies all conditions except Statement 2, which allows at most 3 false statements.\n  - Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\n- **Scenario 5**: Assume 5 statements are true.\n  - This satisfies Statement 6, as 5 is a prime number.\n  - This means 2 statements are false, which does not satisfy Statement 7, as 2 is not a composite number.\n  - Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\n- **Scenario 6**: Assume 7 statements are true.\n  - This satisfies Statement 6, as 7 is a prime number.\n  - This means 0 statements are false, which does not satisfy Statement 7, as 0 is not a composite number.\n  - Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\nAfter analyzing all possible scenarios, we find that there is no consistent solution that satisfies all the given statements. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
