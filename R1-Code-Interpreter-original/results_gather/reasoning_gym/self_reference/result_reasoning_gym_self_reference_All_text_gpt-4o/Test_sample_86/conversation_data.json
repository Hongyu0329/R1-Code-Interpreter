    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This implies that the number of true statements (T) is at least 2.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies that the number of false statements (F) is at most 5, which means T ≥ 2.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This implies T = 4.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies F = 3, which means T = 4.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This implies that either T = 4 (Statement 3 is true) or F = 3 (Statement 4 is true), but not both simultaneously.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - This implies T is a prime number. The possible prime numbers for T (given 2 ≤ T ≤ 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - This implies F is a composite number. The possible composite numbers for F (given 0 ≤ F ≤ 7) are 4, 6, and 8.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values for T and F:\n\n- If T = 2, then F = 5. This satisfies Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 6. However, Statement 7 is not satisfied because 5 is not a composite number.\n\n- If T = 3, then F = 4. This satisfies Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 4, Statement 6, and Statement 7. However, Statement 5 is not satisfied because both Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot be true simultaneously.\n\n- If T = 4, then F = 3. This satisfies Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, and Statement 4. However, Statement 6 is not satisfied because 4 is not a prime number, and Statement 7 is not satisfied because 3 is not a composite number.\n\n- If T = 5, then F = 2. This satisfies Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 6, and Statement 7. However, Statement 3 and Statement 4 are not satisfied, and Statement 5 is not satisfied because neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true.\n\n- If T = 6, then F = 1. This satisfies Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 7. However, Statement 6 is not satisfied because 6 is not a prime number.\n\n- If T = 7, then F = 0. This satisfies Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 6. However, Statement 7 is not satisfied because 0 is not a composite number.\n\nAfter analyzing all possible values for T and F, we find that there is no combination that satisfies all the given statements simultaneously. Therefore, there are no possible solutions.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0>>>"
