    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's go through each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 1 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This implies that not all statements can be false. There must be at least one true statement.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means that there can be 0, 1, 2, or 3 false statements, which implies there can be 7, 6, 5, or 4 true statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This is a specific condition that can be true or false.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This is another specific condition that can be true or false.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means that if Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 must be false, and vice versa.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (from 0 to 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (from 0 to 7) are 4, 6, and 8.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If there are 7 true statements, then Statement 1 is true, but Statement 2 is false (since there are 0 false statements), which contradicts Statement 2. Also, 0 false statements is not a composite number, contradicting Statement 7. Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\n- If there are 6 true statements, then there is 1 false statement. Statement 2 is true, but 1 false statement is not a composite number, contradicting Statement 7. Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\n- If there are 5 true statements, then there are 2 false statements. Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is false, and Statement 5 is satisfied. The number of true statements (5) is a prime number, satisfying Statement 6. However, 2 false statements is not a composite number, contradicting Statement 7. Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\n- If there are 4 true statements, then there are 3 false statements. Statement 2 is true, but Statement 3 and Statement 4 are both false, contradicting Statement 5. Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\n- If there are 3 true statements, then there are 4 false statements. Statement 4 is true, Statement 3 is false, and Statement 5 is satisfied. The number of true statements (3) is a prime number, satisfying Statement 6. The number of false statements (4) is a composite number, satisfying Statement 7. This scenario satisfies all conditions.\n\n- If there are 2 true statements, then there are 5 false statements. Statement 2 is false, contradicting Statement 2. Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\n- If there is 1 true statement, then there are 6 false statements. Statement 2 is false, contradicting Statement 2. Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\n- If there are 0 true statements, then Statement 1 is false, contradicting Statement 1. Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\nAfter analyzing all possible scenarios, the only scenario that satisfies all the conditions is when there are 3 true statements and 4 false statements.\n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
