    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all conditions. Let's go through each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means there must be at least 2 true statements.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies there can be 0, 1, or 2 false statements, meaning there are at least 5 true statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means there are exactly 4 true statements.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 1 of these 7 statements is false.\"\n   - This means there is exactly 1 false statement, implying 6 true statements.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either Statement 3 is true (4 true statements) or Statement 4 is true (6 true statements), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (between 0 and 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (between 0 and 7) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1**: 4 true statements\n  - If Statement 3 is true, then there are 4 true statements.\n  - Statement 4 must be false (since only one of them can be true).\n  - This contradicts Statement 6, as 4 is not a prime number.\n  - Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\n- **Scenario 2**: 6 true statements\n  - If Statement 4 is true, then there is 1 false statement.\n  - Statement 3 must be false (since only one of them can be true).\n  - This satisfies Statement 6, as 6 is not a prime number, but it contradicts Statement 7, as 1 is not a composite number.\n  - Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\n- **Scenario 3**: 5 true statements\n  - This satisfies Statement 1 (at least 2 true) and Statement 2 (at most 2 false).\n  - Statement 3 is false (since there are not exactly 4 true statements).\n  - Statement 4 is false (since there is not exactly 1 false statement).\n  - Statement 5 is true (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is true (since 5 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (since 2 false statements is a composite number).\n  - This scenario satisfies all conditions.\n\n- **Scenario 4**: 7 true statements\n  - This satisfies Statement 1 (at least 2 true) and Statement 2 (at most 2 false).\n  - Statement 3 is false (since there are not exactly 4 true statements).\n  - Statement 4 is false (since there is not exactly 1 false statement).\n  - Statement 5 is true (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is true (since 7 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is false (since 0 false statements is not a composite number).\n  - This scenario does not satisfy all conditions.\n\nAfter analyzing all scenarios, the only scenario that satisfies all conditions is Scenario 3, with 5 true statements.\n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
