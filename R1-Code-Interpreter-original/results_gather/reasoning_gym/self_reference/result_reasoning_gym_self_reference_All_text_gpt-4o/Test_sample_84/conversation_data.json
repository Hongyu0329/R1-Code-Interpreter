    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's go through each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements (T) is 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means the number of false statements (F) is 0, 1, 2, or 3.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means T = 4.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means F = 3, which implies T = 4.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either T = 4 (Statement 3 is true) or F = 3 (Statement 4 is true), but not both simultaneously.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The prime numbers between 0 and 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The composite numbers between 0 and 7 are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If T = 4:\n  - Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is true, and Statement 5 is false (since both cannot be true).\n  - This contradicts Statement 5, so T cannot be 4.\n\n- If T = 3:\n  - Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is true, Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is false, Statement 6 is true (since 3 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (since 4 is composite).\n  - This scenario is consistent.\n\n- If T = 5:\n  - Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false (since F = 2), Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is false, Statement 6 is true (since 5 is prime), and Statement 7 is true (since 2 is not composite).\n  - This scenario is consistent.\n\n- If T = 6:\n  - Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false (since F = 1), Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is false, Statement 6 is false (since 6 is not prime), and Statement 7 is true (since 1 is not composite).\n  - This scenario is inconsistent.\n\n- If T = 7:\n  - Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is false (since F = 0), Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false, Statement 5 is false, Statement 6 is false (since 7 is prime), and Statement 7 is false (since 0 is not composite).\n  - This scenario is inconsistent.\n\nThus, the consistent scenarios are when T = 3 and T = 5. Therefore, there are two possible solutions.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<2>>>."
