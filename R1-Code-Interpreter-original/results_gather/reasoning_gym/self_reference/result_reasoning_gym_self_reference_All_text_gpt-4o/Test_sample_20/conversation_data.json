    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's go through each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements (T) must be 3 or more.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means the number of false statements (F) must be 3 or fewer. Since there are 7 statements in total, T must be 4 or more.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This implies all statements are true, which contradicts the possibility of any false statements. If this is true, then F = 0.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies F = 2, which means T = 5.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either all statements are true (T = 7, F = 0) or exactly 2 statements are false (T = 5, F = 2), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The possible prime numbers for T (given the constraints from other statements) are 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The possible composite numbers for F (given the constraints from other statements) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1**: T = 7, F = 0\n  - Statement 3 is true, and Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is true because either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n  - Statement 6 is true because 7 is a prime number.\n  - Statement 7 is false because 0 is not a composite number.\n  - This scenario does not satisfy all conditions because Statement 7 is false.\n\n- **Scenario 2**: T = 5, F = 2\n  - Statement 3 is false, and Statement 4 is true.\n  - Statement 5 is true because either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n  - Statement 6 is true because 5 is a prime number.\n  - Statement 7 is true because 2 is not a composite number, but this contradicts the requirement for F to be a composite number.\n  - This scenario does not satisfy all conditions because Statement 7 is false.\n\n- **Scenario 3**: T = 4, F = 3\n  - Statement 3 is false, and Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is false because neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true.\n  - Statement 6 is false because 4 is not a prime number.\n  - Statement 7 is true because 3 is not a composite number, but this contradicts the requirement for F to be a composite number.\n  - This scenario does not satisfy all conditions because Statement 6 is false.\n\n- **Scenario 4**: T = 6, F = 1\n  - Statement 3 is false, and Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is false because neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true.\n  - Statement 6 is true because 6 is not a prime number.\n  - Statement 7 is false because 1 is not a composite number.\n  - This scenario does not satisfy all conditions because Statement 7 is false.\n\nAfter analyzing all possible scenarios, we find that none of them satisfy all the conditions simultaneously. Therefore, there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0>>>"
