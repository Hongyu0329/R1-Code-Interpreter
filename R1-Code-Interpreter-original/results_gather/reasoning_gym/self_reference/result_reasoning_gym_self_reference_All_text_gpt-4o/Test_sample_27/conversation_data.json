    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's go through each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements (T) must be 2 or more.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 0 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies that all statements must be true, which contradicts Statement 1. Therefore, Statement 2 must be false.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then T = 1. However, this contradicts Statement 1, which requires at least 2 true statements. Therefore, Statement 3 must be false.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then all statements are false, which is a contradiction. Therefore, Statement 4 must be false.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - Since both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, Statement 5 must also be false.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - Possible prime numbers for T (the number of true statements) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The number of false statements (F) is 7 - T. Possible composite numbers for F are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values for T and F:\n\n- If T = 2 (a prime number), then F = 5 (not a composite number). This does not satisfy Statement 7.\n- If T = 3 (a prime number), then F = 4 (a composite number). This satisfies both Statements 6 and 7.\n- If T = 5 (a prime number), then F = 2 (not a composite number). This does not satisfy Statement 7.\n- If T = 7 (a prime number), then F = 0 (not a composite number). This does not satisfy Statement 7.\n\nThe only scenario that satisfies all conditions is when T = 3 and F = 4.\n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is 1.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<1>>>."
