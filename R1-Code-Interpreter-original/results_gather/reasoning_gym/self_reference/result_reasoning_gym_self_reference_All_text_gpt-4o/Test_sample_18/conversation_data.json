    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's go through each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements (T) is 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means the number of false statements (F) is 0 or 1, which implies T is 6 or 7.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means T = 4.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means F = 3, which implies T = 4.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either T = 4 (Statement 3 is true) or F = 3 (Statement 4 is true), but not both simultaneously.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The prime numbers between 0 and 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. So, T could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The composite numbers between 0 and 7 are 4, 6, and 8. So, F could be 4, 6, or 8.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values of T and F:\n\n- If T = 4:\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is false (since F = 3).\n  - Statement 3 is true.\n  - Statement 4 is true.\n  - Statement 5 is false (since both Statements 3 and 4 are true).\n  - Statement 6 is false (4 is not a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (F = 3, which is not composite, so this is false).\n\n- If T = 5:\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is false (since F = 2).\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since neither Statement 3 nor 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is true (5 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is false (F = 2, which is not composite).\n\n- If T = 6:\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is true (since F = 1).\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since neither Statement 3 nor 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is false (6 is not a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (F = 1, which is not composite, so this is false).\n\n- If T = 7:\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is true (since F = 0).\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since neither Statement 3 nor 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is true (7 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is false (F = 0, which is not composite).\n\nFrom the above analysis, the only consistent solution is when T = 5, where Statements 1, 5, and 6 are true, and the rest are false. This satisfies all conditions.\n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
