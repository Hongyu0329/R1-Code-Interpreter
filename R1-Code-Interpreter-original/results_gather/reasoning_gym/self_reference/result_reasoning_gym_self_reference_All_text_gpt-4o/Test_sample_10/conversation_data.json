    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's go through each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 1 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This implies that not all statements can be false. There must be at least one true statement.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means that there can be 0, 1, 2, or 3 false statements, which implies there can be 7, 6, 5, or 4 true statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This directly states that there are 4 true statements.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies there are 4 true statements, as 7 - 3 = 4.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means that either there are exactly 4 true statements (Statement 3 is true) or exactly 3 false statements (Statement 4 is true), but not both. However, since both statements imply the same condition (4 true statements), this statement is inherently contradictory if both are considered true.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. Therefore, the number of true statements could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6. Therefore, the number of false statements could be 4 or 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If there are 4 true statements:\n  - Statement 3 is true, and Statement 4 is true, which contradicts Statement 5. Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\n- If there are 3 true statements:\n  - This would mean there are 4 false statements, which is a composite number, satisfying Statement 7.\n  - However, this contradicts Statement 2, which states at most 3 statements can be false. Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\n- If there are 5 true statements:\n  - This means there are 2 false statements, which is not a composite number, contradicting Statement 7. Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\n- If there are 7 true statements:\n  - This means there are 0 false statements, which is not a composite number, contradicting Statement 7. Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\n- If there are 6 true statements:\n  - This means there is 1 false statement, which is not a composite number, contradicting Statement 7. Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\n- If there are 2 true statements:\n  - This means there are 5 false statements, which is not a composite number, contradicting Statement 7. Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\nAfter analyzing all possible scenarios, we find that none of them satisfy all the conditions simultaneously. Therefore, there are no possible solutions.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
