    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This implies that the number of true statements (T) is at least 3.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 4 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This implies that the number of false statements (F) is at most 4. Since there are 7 statements in total, T = 7 - F, so T is at least 3.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - If this statement is true, then all statements are true, which contradicts the other statements that imply some are false. Therefore, Statement 3 must be false.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - If this statement is true, then F = 3 and T = 4.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - Since Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 must be true for Statement 5 to be true.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - If Statement 4 is true, then T = 4. However, 4 is not a prime number, so Statement 6 must be false.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - If Statement 4 is true, then F = 3. However, 3 is not a composite number, so Statement 7 must be false.\n\nNow, let's verify the consistency of these conclusions:\n- If Statement 4 is true, then T = 4 and F = 3.\n- Statement 1 is satisfied because T = 4, which is at least 3.\n- Statement 2 is satisfied because F = 3, which is at most 4.\n- Statement 3 is false, which is consistent with our earlier conclusion.\n- Statement 5 is true because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 6 is false because T = 4 is not a prime number.\n- Statement 7 is false because F = 3 is not a composite number.\n\nThus, the only consistent solution is when T = 4 and F = 3, with Statements 1, 2, 4, and 5 being true, and Statements 3, 6, and 7 being false.\n\nTherefore, there is only one possible solution.\n\nThe number of possible solutions is: <<<1>>>."
