    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's go through each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements (T) must be 2 or more.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 4 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means the number of false statements (F) must be 4 or fewer. Since there are 7 statements in total, T must be at least 3 (because T = 7 - F).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then all statements are true, which contradicts Statement 1 (since it implies at least 2 are true, not exactly 7). Therefore, Statement 3 must be false.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then F = 3 and T = 4.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - Since Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 must be true.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - From Statement 4, we have T = 4. However, 4 is not a prime number, so Statement 6 must be false.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - From Statement 4, we have F = 3. However, 3 is not a composite number, so Statement 7 must be false.\n\nNow, let's summarize the analysis:\n- From Statement 4 being true, we have T = 4 and F = 3.\n- Statement 1 is satisfied because T = 4 (at least 2 are true).\n- Statement 2 is satisfied because F = 3 (at most 4 are false).\n- Statement 3 is false, which is consistent with our findings.\n- Statement 5 is satisfied because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 6 is false because T = 4 is not a prime number.\n- Statement 7 is false because F = 3 is not a composite number.\n\nGiven these conditions, there is only one consistent solution where T = 4 and F = 3. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
