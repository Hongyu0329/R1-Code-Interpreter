    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine how many of them can be true simultaneously. Let's go through each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This implies that the number of true statements (T) is 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies that the number of false statements (F) is 0, 1, or 2. Since there are 7 statements in total, T can be 5, 6, or 7.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This implies T = 5.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 6 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies F = 6, which means T = 1.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either T = 5 or T = 1, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The prime numbers between 1 and 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. So, T can be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The composite numbers between 0 and 7 are 4, 6, and 8. So, F can be 4, 6, or 8.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values for T and F:\n\n- **T = 1**: \n  - F = 6, which satisfies Statement 4.\n  - Statement 4 being true means Statement 3 is false, which satisfies Statement 5.\n  - However, T = 1 is not a prime number, so Statement 6 is false.\n  - F = 6 is a composite number, so Statement 7 is true.\n  - This configuration satisfies Statements 4, 5, and 7.\n\n- **T = 5**:\n  - F = 2, which does not satisfy Statement 4.\n  - Statement 3 being true means Statement 4 is false, which satisfies Statement 5.\n  - T = 5 is a prime number, so Statement 6 is true.\n  - F = 2 is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false.\n  - This configuration satisfies Statements 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6.\n\n- **T = 6**:\n  - F = 1, which does not satisfy Statement 4.\n  - Statement 3 is false, and Statement 4 is false, which does not satisfy Statement 5.\n  - T = 6 is not a prime number, so Statement 6 is false.\n  - F = 1 is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false.\n  - This configuration does not satisfy enough statements.\n\n- **T = 7**:\n  - F = 0, which does not satisfy Statement 4.\n  - Statement 3 is false, and Statement 4 is false, which does not satisfy Statement 5.\n  - T = 7 is a prime number, so Statement 6 is true.\n  - F = 0 is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false.\n  - This configuration does not satisfy enough statements.\n\nFrom the analysis, the only configurations that satisfy the conditions are T = 1 and T = 5. Therefore, there are two possible solutions.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<2>>>."
