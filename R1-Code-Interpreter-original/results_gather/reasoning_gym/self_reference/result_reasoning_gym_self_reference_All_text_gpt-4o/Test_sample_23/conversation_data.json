    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's go through each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements (T) is at least 3.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means the number of false statements (F) is at most 1, which implies T ≥ 6.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 6 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means T = 6.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means F = 2, which implies T = 5.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either T = 6 or T = 5, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The possible prime numbers for T (given the constraints) are 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The possible composite numbers for F (given the constraints) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **If T = 6**:\n  - Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since only Statement 3 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is false (6 is not a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is false (F = 1, which is not composite).\n  - This scenario satisfies Statement 2 (F = 1) and Statement 1 (T ≥ 3).\n  - Total true statements: 6 (Statements 1, 2, 3, 5, and two others).\n\n- **If T = 5**:\n  - Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is true.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since only Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is true (5 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is false (F = 2, which is not composite).\n  - This scenario satisfies Statement 1 (T ≥ 3).\n  - Total true statements: 5 (Statements 1, 4, 5, 6, and one other).\n\n- **If T = 7**:\n  - All statements are true.\n  - This contradicts Statement 5, which requires one of Statements 3 or 4 to be false.\n\n- **If T = 3 or T = 4**:\n  - These do not satisfy Statement 2 (T ≥ 6) or Statement 5 (either T = 5 or T = 6).\n\nFrom the analysis, the only consistent scenario is when T = 6. Therefore, there is only one possible solution.\n\nThe number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
