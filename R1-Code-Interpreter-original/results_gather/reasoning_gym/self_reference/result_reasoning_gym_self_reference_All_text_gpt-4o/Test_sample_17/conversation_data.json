    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This implies that the number of true statements (T) is 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies that the number of false statements (F) is 0, 1, 2, or 3.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This implies that all statements are false, which contradicts the existence of true statements. Therefore, Statement 3 must be false.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies that the number of false statements (F) is 2, and thus the number of true statements (T) is 5.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - Since Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 must be true.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The possible prime numbers for T (given the constraints) are 5 and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The possible composite numbers for F (given the constraints) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the consistency of these statements:\n\n- From Statement 4, we know that F = 2 and T = 5.\n- Statement 6 is satisfied because 5 is a prime number.\n- Statement 7 is not satisfied because 2 is not a composite number.\n\nSince Statement 7 is false, we need to check if this is consistent with the other statements:\n\n- If T = 5, then F = 2, which satisfies Statement 4.\n- Statement 1 is satisfied because T = 5 is at least 4.\n- Statement 2 is satisfied because F = 2 is at most 3.\n- Statement 5 is satisfied because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false.\n\nThus, the only consistent solution is when T = 5 and F = 2. This satisfies all the conditions except Statement 7, which is false.\n\nTherefore, there is only one possible solution.\n\nThe number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
