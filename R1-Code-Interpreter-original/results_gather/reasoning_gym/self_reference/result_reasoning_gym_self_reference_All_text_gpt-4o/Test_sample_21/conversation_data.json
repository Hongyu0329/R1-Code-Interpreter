    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's go through each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1: 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - This implies that all 7 statements are true.\n\n2. **Statement 2: 'At most 7 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - This is trivially true because there are only 7 statements, so at most 7 can be false.\n\n3. **Statement 3: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - This means that 5 statements are true and 2 are false.\n\n4. **Statement 4: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - This means that 5 statements are true and 2 are false.\n\n5. **Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'**\n   - This means that either Statement 3 is true or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Since Statements 3 and 4 are identical in terms of their truth conditions (5 true, 2 false), this statement is inherently contradictory if both are considered.\n\n6. **Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'**\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (out of 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'**\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (out of 7) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1: All 7 statements are true.**\n  - This satisfies Statement 1.\n  - The number of true statements is 7, which is not a prime number, so Statement 6 is false.\n  - The number of false statements is 0, which is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false.\n  - This scenario does not satisfy all conditions.\n\n- **Scenario 2: 5 statements are true, 2 are false.**\n  - This satisfies both Statement 3 and Statement 4, but Statement 5 requires that only one of them is true, so this scenario is not possible.\n\n- **Scenario 3: 3 statements are true, 4 are false.**\n  - The number of true statements is 3, which is a prime number, satisfying Statement 6.\n  - The number of false statements is 4, which is a composite number, satisfying Statement 7.\n  - This scenario does not satisfy Statement 1, Statement 3, or Statement 4, but it does not contradict Statement 5 because neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true.\n\n- **Scenario 4: 2 statements are true, 5 are false.**\n  - The number of true statements is 2, which is a prime number, satisfying Statement 6.\n  - The number of false statements is 5, which is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false.\n  - This scenario does not satisfy Statement 1, Statement 3, or Statement 4, and it does not satisfy Statement 5.\n\n- **Scenario 5: 1 statement is true, 6 are false.**\n  - The number of true statements is 1, which is not a prime number, so Statement 6 is false.\n  - The number of false statements is 6, which is a composite number, satisfying Statement 7.\n  - This scenario does not satisfy Statement 1, Statement 3, or Statement 4, and it does not satisfy Statement 5.\n\n- **Scenario 6: 0 statements are true, 7 are false.**\n  - The number of true statements is 0, which is not a prime number, so Statement 6 is false.\n  - The number of false statements is 7, which is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false.\n  - This scenario does not satisfy Statement 1, Statement 3, or Statement 4, and it does not satisfy Statement 5.\n\nAfter analyzing all scenarios, only Scenario 3 (3 true, 4 false) satisfies the conditions of having a prime number of true statements and a composite number of false statements without contradicting the other statements.\n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
