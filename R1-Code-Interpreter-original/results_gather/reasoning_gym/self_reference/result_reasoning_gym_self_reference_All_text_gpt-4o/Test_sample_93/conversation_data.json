    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's go through each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1: 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - This implies that all 7 statements are true.\n\n2. **Statement 2: 'At most 6 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - This implies that at least 1 statement is true.\n\n3. **Statement 3: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - This implies that 5 statements are true and 2 are false.\n\n4. **Statement 4: 'Exactly 6 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - This implies that 1 statement is true and 6 are false.\n\n5. **Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'**\n   - This implies that either Statement 3 is true (5 true statements) or Statement 4 is true (1 true statement), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'**\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'**\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements are 4, 6, and 8.\n\nNow, let's analyze the consistency of these statements:\n\n- If Statement 1 is true, then all statements are true. This contradicts Statement 4, which would be false, making Statement 1 false. Therefore, Statement 1 cannot be true.\n\n- If Statement 2 is true, then at least 1 statement is true, which is consistent with all scenarios except when all statements are false.\n\n- If Statement 3 is true, then there are exactly 5 true statements. This is consistent with Statement 5, which allows for either Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be true, but not both.\n\n- If Statement 4 is true, then there is exactly 1 true statement. This is also consistent with Statement 5, which allows for either Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be true, but not both.\n\n- If Statement 5 is true, then either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. This is consistent with having either 5 true statements or 1 true statement.\n\n- If Statement 6 is true, the number of true statements must be a prime number (2, 3, 5, or 7).\n\n- If Statement 7 is true, the number of false statements must be a composite number (4, 6, or 8).\n\nLet's evaluate the possible scenarios:\n\n1. **5 true statements (Statements 3 and 5 are true):**\n   - True statements: 3, 5, and any 3 others.\n   - False statements: 1, 4, and any 2 others.\n   - Number of true statements is 5 (prime).\n   - Number of false statements is 2 (not composite).\n   - This scenario is not possible because the number of false statements is not composite.\n\n2. **1 true statement (Statements 4 and 5 are true):**\n   - True statement: 4.\n   - False statements: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7.\n   - Number of true statements is 1 (not prime).\n   - Number of false statements is 6 (composite).\n   - This scenario is not possible because the number of true statements is not prime.\n\n3. **2 true statements:**\n   - True statements: 6 and any 1 other.\n   - False statements: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and any 1 other.\n   - Number of true statements is 2 (prime).\n   - Number of false statements is 5 (not composite).\n   - This scenario is not possible because the number of false statements is not composite.\n\n4. **3 true statements:**\n   - True statements: 6 and any 2 others.\n   - False statements: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and any 1 other.\n   - Number of true statements is 3 (prime).\n   - Number of false statements is 4 (composite).\n   - This scenario is possible.\n\n5. **7 true statements:**\n   - All statements are true.\n   - Number of true statements is 7 (prime).\n   - Number of false statements is 0 (not composite).\n   - This scenario is not possible because the number of false statements is not composite.\n\nAfter evaluating all scenarios, the only possible solution is when there are 3 true statements and 4 false statements. Therefore, there is only one possible solution.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
