    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine how many of them can be true simultaneously. Let's evaluate each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then all 7 statements must be true. However, this creates a contradiction because Statement 3 claims that exactly 0 statements are true, which cannot be true if all statements are true. Therefore, Statement 1 cannot be true.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then at least 5 statements must be true. This means that Statements 3 and 4 cannot both be true, as they would require more than 2 false statements. We will check the consistency of this later.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then it creates a paradox because it would mean that Statement 3 itself is true, which contradicts its own claim. Therefore, Statement 3 cannot be true.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then exactly 3 statements are true. We will check the consistency of this later.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - Since Statement 3 cannot be true, Statement 5 implies that Statement 4 must be true.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - If Statement 4 is true, then there are 3 true statements, which is a prime number. Therefore, Statement 6 can be true.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - If Statement 4 is true, then there are 4 false statements, which is a composite number. Therefore, Statement 7 can be true.\n\nNow, let's verify the consistency of having exactly 3 true statements:\n\n- If Statement 4 is true, then Statements 5, 6, and 7 can also be true, making a total of 3 true statements.\n- This satisfies Statement 6, as 3 is a prime number.\n- This satisfies Statement 7, as 4 is a composite number.\n- Statement 2 cannot be true because it requires at least 5 true statements, which contradicts having exactly 3 true statements.\n\nThus, the only consistent scenario is having Statements 4, 6, and 7 as true, and the rest as false.\n\nTherefore, there is only one possible solution where exactly 3 statements are true.\n\nThe number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
