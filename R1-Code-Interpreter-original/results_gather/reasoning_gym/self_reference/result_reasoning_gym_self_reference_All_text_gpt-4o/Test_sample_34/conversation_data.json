    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This implies that the number of true statements (T) is 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies that the number of false statements (F) is 0, 1, 2, or 3.\n   - Since there are 7 statements in total, T = 7 - F, so T can be 7, 6, 5, or 4.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This implies T = 2.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies T = 0.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either T = 2 or T = 0, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n   - So T can be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6.\n   - Since F = 7 - T, F can be 4 or 6, which means T can be 3 or 1.\n\nNow, let's analyze the compatibility of these statements:\n\n- From Statement 1 and 2, T can be 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n- From Statement 3, T = 2.\n- From Statement 4, T = 0.\n- From Statement 5, T = 2 or T = 0, but not both.\n- From Statement 6, T can be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n- From Statement 7, T can be 3 or 1.\n\nCombining all these conditions:\n- T = 2 is possible from Statement 3 and 6.\n- T = 3 is possible from Statement 6 and 7.\n- T = 5 is possible from Statement 1 and 6.\n- T = 7 is possible from Statement 1 and 6.\n\nNow, let's check the consistency of these possible values of T with all statements:\n\n- **T = 2**: \n  - Satisfies Statement 3 and 6.\n  - Violates Statement 1 and 2.\n  - Satisfies Statement 5 (since Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false).\n  - Violates Statement 7 (since F = 5, which is not composite).\n\n- **T = 3**:\n  - Violates Statement 1.\n  - Satisfies Statement 2, 6, and 7.\n  - Violates Statement 5 (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n\n- **T = 5**:\n  - Satisfies Statement 1, 2, and 6.\n  - Violates Statement 3, 4, and 5.\n  - Violates Statement 7 (since F = 2, which is not composite).\n\n- **T = 7**:\n  - Satisfies Statement 1, 2, and 6.\n  - Violates Statement 3, 4, 5, and 7 (since F = 0, which is not composite).\n\nNone of the possible values of T satisfy all the statements simultaneously. Therefore, there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\nThe number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
