    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's go through each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements, \\( T \\), must be at least 2. So, \\( T \\geq 2 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies the number of false statements, \\( F \\), must be at most 3. So, \\( F \\leq 3 \\).\n   - Since there are 7 statements in total, \\( T + F = 7 \\). Therefore, \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means \\( T = 5 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means \\( F = 2 \\), which implies \\( T = 5 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either \\( T = 5 \\) (Statement 3 is true) or \\( F = 2 \\) (Statement 4 is true), but not both. However, since both conditions imply \\( T = 5 \\), this statement is inherently contradictory if both are true. Therefore, only one can be true.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. So, \\( T \\) could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6. So, \\( F \\) could be 4 or 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values of \\( T \\) and \\( F \\) that satisfy all these conditions:\n\n- From Statement 2, \\( F \\leq 3 \\), so \\( F \\) cannot be 4 or 6. Therefore, Statement 7 cannot be true.\n- From Statement 6, \\( T \\) could be 2, 3, 5, or 7. However, since \\( F \\leq 3 \\), \\( T \\) must be at least 4. Therefore, \\( T \\) could be 5 or 7.\n- If \\( T = 5 \\), then \\( F = 2 \\). This satisfies Statement 4, but not Statement 5, because both Statements 3 and 4 would be true.\n- If \\( T = 7 \\), then \\( F = 0 \\). This satisfies Statement 6, but not Statement 1, because it requires at least 2 true statements, which is already satisfied, but it contradicts the requirement of having at least 2 false statements from Statement 1.\n\nGiven these analyses, the only consistent solution is when \\( T = 5 \\) and \\( F = 2 \\), but this violates Statement 5. Therefore, there is no consistent solution that satisfies all the statements.\n\nThus, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
