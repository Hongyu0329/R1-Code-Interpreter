    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's go through each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements (T) is 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 6 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means the number of false statements (F) is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.\n   - Since there are 7 statements in total, T = 7 - F. Therefore, T can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means T = 4.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means F = 3, which implies T = 4.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either T = 4 (Statement 3 is true) or F = 3 (Statement 4 is true), but not both simultaneously.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The prime numbers between 1 and 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. So, T can be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The composite numbers between 0 and 7 are 4, 6. So, F can be 4 or 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values of T and F that satisfy all these conditions:\n\n- From Statement 1, T can be 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n- From Statement 2, T can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n- From Statement 3, T = 4.\n- From Statement 4, F = 3, which implies T = 4.\n- From Statement 5, either T = 4 or F = 3, but not both. Since both imply T = 4, this condition is satisfied if T = 4.\n- From Statement 6, T can be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n- From Statement 7, F can be 4 or 6, which implies T = 3 or T = 1.\n\nCombining all these conditions, we find:\n\n- T = 4 satisfies Statements 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n- T = 5 satisfies Statements 1, 2, and 6.\n- T = 7 satisfies Statements 1, 2, and 6.\n\nHowever, T = 4 is the only value that satisfies all conditions, including the exclusivity condition in Statement 5.\n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
