    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This implies that the number of true statements (T) is at least 2.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies that the number of false statements (F) is at most 5, which means T â‰¥ 2.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This implies T = 5.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies T = 0, which contradicts Statement 1. Therefore, Statement 4 cannot be true.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - Since Statement 4 is false, Statement 3 must be true. Therefore, T = 5.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - T = 5, which is a prime number. Therefore, Statement 6 is true.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - F = 7 - T = 7 - 5 = 2, which is not a composite number. Therefore, Statement 7 is false.\n\nNow, let's verify the consistency of these conclusions:\n- T = 5 satisfies Statement 1 (at least 2 true).\n- T = 5 satisfies Statement 2 (at most 5 false).\n- T = 5 satisfies Statement 3 (exactly 5 true).\n- Statement 4 is false, which is consistent with Statement 5.\n- T = 5 satisfies Statement 6 (prime number).\n- F = 2 does not satisfy Statement 7 (composite number), which is consistent with our conclusion that Statement 7 is false.\n\nSince all conditions are satisfied with T = 5, there is only one possible solution.\n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
