    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement and determine the number of possible solutions where all statements are consistent with each other.\n\n1. **Statement 1: 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - This implies that all 7 statements are true.\n\n2. **Statement 2: 'At most 7 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - This is trivially true because there are only 7 statements, so at most 7 can be false.\n\n3. **Statement 3: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - This implies that 2 statements are false.\n\n4. **Statement 4: 'Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - This implies that all 7 statements are true.\n\n5. **Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'**\n   - This means either Statement 3 is true (5 true statements) or Statement 4 is true (7 true statements), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'**\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (out of 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'**\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (out of 7) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the consistency of these statements:\n\n- If Statement 1 is true, then all 7 statements are true. This would make Statement 3 false (since it claims exactly 5 are true), and Statement 5 false (since it requires either Statement 3 or 4 to be true, but not both). Statement 6 would be true (7 is a prime number), and Statement 7 would be false (0 false statements is not a composite number). This is inconsistent because Statement 7 would be false.\n\n- If Statement 3 is true, then exactly 5 statements are true. This would make Statement 4 false (since it claims 0 are false), and Statement 5 true (since it requires either Statement 3 or 4 to be true, but not both). Statement 6 would be true (5 is a prime number), and Statement 7 would be true (2 false statements is not a composite number, but 5 true statements is consistent with Statement 6). This is consistent.\n\n- If Statement 4 is true, then all 7 statements are true. This would make Statement 3 false, and Statement 5 false (since it requires either Statement 3 or 4 to be true, but not both). Statement 6 would be true (7 is a prime number), and Statement 7 would be false (0 false statements is not a composite number). This is inconsistent because Statement 7 would be false.\n\n- If Statement 5 is true, then either Statement 3 or 4 is true, but not both. This is consistent with Statement 3 being true and Statement 4 being false.\n\n- If Statement 6 is true, then the number of true statements is a prime number. This is consistent with 5 true statements (as 5 is a prime number).\n\n- If Statement 7 is true, then the number of false statements is a composite number. This is consistent with 2 false statements (as 5 true statements is consistent with Statement 6).\n\nFrom this analysis, the only consistent scenario is when Statement 3 is true, which implies exactly 5 statements are true. This satisfies all conditions: Statement 5 is true, Statement 6 is true, and Statement 7 is true.\n\nTherefore, there is only one possible solution where all statements are consistent.\n\nThe number of possible solutions is: <<<1>>>."
