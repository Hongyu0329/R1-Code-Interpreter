    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's evaluate each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 5 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then there are 5, 6, or 7 true statements.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then there are 0 or 1 false statements, meaning there are 6 or 7 true statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then there are exactly 3 true statements.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then there are exactly 6 true statements.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. If Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 must be false, and vice versa.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (out of 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (out of 7) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1**: Assume 6 true statements.\n  - Statement 1: True (since 6 ≥ 5)\n  - Statement 2: True (since 1 ≤ 1)\n  - Statement 3: False (since 6 ≠ 3)\n  - Statement 4: True (since 1 = 1)\n  - Statement 5: True (since Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false)\n  - Statement 6: False (since 6 is not a prime number)\n  - Statement 7: True (since 1 false statement is not composite, but this contradicts the assumption of 6 true statements)\n\n- **Scenario 2**: Assume 5 true statements.\n  - Statement 1: True (since 5 ≥ 5)\n  - Statement 2: False (since 2 > 1)\n  - Statement 3: False (since 5 ≠ 3)\n  - Statement 4: False (since 2 ≠ 1)\n  - Statement 5: True (since both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false)\n  - Statement 6: True (since 5 is a prime number)\n  - Statement 7: False (since 2 false statements is not composite)\n\n- **Scenario 3**: Assume 7 true statements.\n  - Statement 1: True (since 7 ≥ 5)\n  - Statement 2: True (since 0 ≤ 1)\n  - Statement 3: False (since 7 ≠ 3)\n  - Statement 4: False (since 0 ≠ 1)\n  - Statement 5: True (since both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false)\n  - Statement 6: True (since 7 is a prime number)\n  - Statement 7: False (since 0 false statements is not composite)\n\n- **Scenario 4**: Assume 3 true statements.\n  - Statement 1: False (since 3 < 5)\n  - Statement 2: False (since 4 > 1)\n  - Statement 3: True (since 3 = 3)\n  - Statement 4: False (since 4 ≠ 1)\n  - Statement 5: True (since Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false)\n  - Statement 6: True (since 3 is a prime number)\n  - Statement 7: True (since 4 false statements is composite)\n\nFrom the analysis, only Scenario 4 satisfies all the conditions. Therefore, there is only one possible solution.\n\nThe number of possible solutions is: <<<1>>>."
