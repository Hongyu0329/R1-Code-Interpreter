    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\n1. **Statement 1: 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - This implies that the number of true statements (T) is at least 4.\n\n2. **Statement 2: 'At most 4 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - This implies that the number of false statements (F) is at most 4.\n   - Since there are 7 statements in total, T + F = 7.\n   - Therefore, T must be at least 3 (since F â‰¤ 4).\n\n3. **Statement 3: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - This implies T = 2.\n\n4. **Statement 4: 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - This implies F = 7, which is impossible because T + F = 7.\n\n5. **Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'**\n   - This means either Statement 3 is true (T = 2) or Statement 4 is true (F = 7), but not both.\n   - Since Statement 4 is impossible, Statement 3 must be true, implying T = 2.\n\n6. **Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'**\n   - Prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n   - Since Statement 3 is true, T = 2, which is a prime number.\n\n7. **Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'**\n   - Composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6.\n   - If T = 2, then F = 5, which is not a composite number.\n\nNow, let's analyze the consistency of these statements:\n\n- If T = 2 (from Statement 3 being true), then F = 5.\n- Statement 7 is false because 5 is not a composite number.\n- Statement 1 is false because T is not at least 4.\n- Statement 2 is true because F = 5, which is not more than 4.\n- Statement 6 is true because 2 is a prime number.\n\nGiven these conditions, the only consistent scenario is:\n- T = 2 (Statements 3, 5, and 6 are true)\n- F = 5 (Statements 1, 4, and 7 are false)\n\nThus, there is only one possible solution that satisfies all the conditions.\n\nThe number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
