    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's go through each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1: 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - This implies that all 7 statements are true. If this statement is true, then all statements must be true.\n\n2. **Statement 2: 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - This means that there can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 false statements. If this statement is true, then the number of false statements is between 0 and 5.\n\n3. **Statement 3: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - This means that there are exactly 4 true statements and 3 false statements.\n\n4. **Statement 4: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - This means that there are exactly 3 false statements and 4 true statements.\n\n5. **Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'**\n   - This means that either Statement 3 is true or Statement 4 is true, but not both simultaneously.\n\n6. **Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'**\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (out of 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'**\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (out of 7) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the compatibility of these statements:\n\n- If Statement 1 is true, then all statements are true. This contradicts Statements 3, 4, 5, and 7, which require some statements to be false. Therefore, Statement 1 cannot be true.\n\n- If Statement 3 is true, then there are exactly 4 true statements. This means Statements 4 and 5 cannot be true simultaneously. Statement 6 can be true because 4 is not a prime number, so Statement 3 being true contradicts Statement 6. Therefore, Statement 3 cannot be true.\n\n- If Statement 4 is true, then there are exactly 3 false statements. This means Statements 3 and 5 cannot be true simultaneously. Statement 6 can be true because 4 is a prime number, so Statement 4 being true does not contradict Statement 6. Statement 7 can be true because 3 is not a composite number, so Statement 4 being true contradicts Statement 7. Therefore, Statement 4 cannot be true.\n\n- If Statement 5 is true, then either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 can be true, Statement 5 cannot be true.\n\n- If Statement 6 is true, then the number of true statements is a prime number. The possible prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, and 7. However, 7 true statements contradicts Statement 1, and 3 true statements contradicts Statement 4. Therefore, the only possible numbers of true statements are 2 and 5.\n\n- If Statement 7 is true, then the number of false statements is a composite number. The possible composite numbers are 4 and 6. Therefore, the only possible numbers of false statements are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's find the compatible solutions:\n\n- If there are 2 true statements, then there are 5 false statements. This contradicts Statement 7, which requires a composite number of false statements.\n\n- If there are 5 true statements, then there are 2 false statements. This contradicts Statement 7, which requires a composite number of false statements.\n\nTherefore, there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\nThe number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
