    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement and determine the number of true statements among the seven. Let's go through each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements, \\( T \\), must be \\( T \\geq 3 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 7 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This is trivially true because there are only 7 statements, so \\( F \\leq 7 \\). This doesn't provide any new information.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means \\( T = 4 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means \\( F = 3 \\), which implies \\( T = 4 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either \\( T = 4 \\) (Statement 3 is true) or \\( F = 3 \\) (Statement 4 is true), but not both. However, since both conditions imply \\( T = 4 \\), this statement is problematic if both are true.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The possible prime numbers for \\( T \\) (given \\( T \\geq 3 \\)) are 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The possible composite numbers for \\( F \\) (given \\( F \\leq 7 \\)) are 4, 6, and 8. However, since there are only 7 statements, \\( F \\) can only be 4 or 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **If \\( T = 3 \\):**\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since both Statements 3 and 4 are false).\n  - Statement 6 is true (3 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is false (4 is a composite number, but \\( F = 4 \\) is not possible here).\n  - This scenario is inconsistent because Statement 7 cannot be true.\n\n- **If \\( T = 4 \\):**\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 3 is true.\n  - Statement 4 is true.\n  - Statement 5 is false (since both Statements 3 and 4 are true).\n  - Statement 6 is false (4 is not a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (3 is not a composite number, but \\( F = 3 \\) is not possible here).\n  - This scenario is inconsistent because Statement 5 cannot be false.\n\n- **If \\( T = 5 \\):**\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since both Statements 3 and 4 are false).\n  - Statement 6 is true (5 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (2 is not a composite number, but \\( F = 2 \\) is not possible here).\n  - This scenario is consistent.\n\n- **If \\( T = 6 \\):**\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since both Statements 3 and 4 are false).\n  - Statement 6 is false (6 is not a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is false (1 is not a composite number).\n  - This scenario is inconsistent because Statement 6 cannot be false.\n\n- **If \\( T = 7 \\):**\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since both Statements 3 and 4 are false).\n  - Statement 6 is true (7 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is false (0 is not a composite number).\n  - This scenario is inconsistent because Statement 7 cannot be false.\n\nAfter analyzing all possible scenarios, the only consistent scenario is when \\( T = 5 \\).\n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
