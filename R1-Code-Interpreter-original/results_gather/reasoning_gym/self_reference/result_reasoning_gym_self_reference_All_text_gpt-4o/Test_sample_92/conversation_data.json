    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This implies that the number of true statements (T) is 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies that the number of false statements (F) is 0 or 1, which means T is 6 or 7.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This implies T = 0. If this statement is true, it creates a contradiction because it would mean all statements are false, including itself.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies F = 3, which means T = 4.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This implies that either T = 0 (Statement 3 is true) or T = 4 (Statement 4 is true), but not both. Since T = 0 leads to a contradiction, T = 4 is the only possibility.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - Prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. This implies T could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - Composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6. This implies F could be 4 or 6, which means T could be 3 or 1.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values of T:\n\n- **T = 4**: \n  - Satisfies Statement 1 (at least 4 true).\n  - Does not satisfy Statement 2 (at most 1 false).\n  - Does not satisfy Statement 3 (exactly 0 true).\n  - Satisfies Statement 4 (exactly 3 false).\n  - Satisfies Statement 5 (either 3 or 4 true, not both).\n  - Does not satisfy Statement 6 (4 is not prime).\n  - Does not satisfy Statement 7 (3 false is not composite).\n\n- **T = 6**: \n  - Satisfies Statement 1 (at least 4 true).\n  - Satisfies Statement 2 (at most 1 false).\n  - Does not satisfy Statement 3 (exactly 0 true).\n  - Does not satisfy Statement 4 (exactly 3 false).\n  - Does not satisfy Statement 5 (either 3 or 4 true, not both).\n  - Does not satisfy Statement 6 (6 is not prime).\n  - Satisfies Statement 7 (1 false is not composite).\n\n- **T = 7**: \n  - Satisfies Statement 1 (at least 4 true).\n  - Satisfies Statement 2 (at most 1 false).\n  - Does not satisfy Statement 3 (exactly 0 true).\n  - Does not satisfy Statement 4 (exactly 3 false).\n  - Does not satisfy Statement 5 (either 3 or 4 true, not both).\n  - Satisfies Statement 6 (7 is prime).\n  - Does not satisfy Statement 7 (0 false is not composite).\n\nThe only value of T that satisfies all the conditions is **T = 4**. Therefore, there is only one possible solution.\n\nThe number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
