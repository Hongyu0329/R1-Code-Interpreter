    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine how many possible solutions exist where these statements can be true simultaneously.\n\n1. **Statement 1: 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - This means the number of true statements (T) is at least 4. So, T ≥ 4.\n\n2. **Statement 2: 'At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - This means the number of false statements (F) is at most 1. So, F ≤ 1.\n\n3. **Statement 3: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - This means T = 5.\n\n4. **Statement 4: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - This means F = 2.\n\n5. **Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'**\n   - This means either T = 5 or F = 2, but not both simultaneously.\n\n6. **Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'**\n   - This means T is a prime number. The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'**\n   - This means F is a composite number. The composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze these conditions:\n\n- From Statement 2, F ≤ 1. This implies T ≥ 6 because there are 7 statements in total.\n- From Statement 1, T ≥ 4.\n- From Statement 6, T must be a prime number. The only prime number that satisfies T ≥ 6 is 7.\n- If T = 7, then F = 0. This satisfies Statement 2 (F ≤ 1).\n- If T = 7, then Statement 3 (T = 5) is false, and Statement 4 (F = 2) is false. This satisfies Statement 5 because neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true.\n- If T = 7, Statement 6 is true because 7 is a prime number.\n- If T = 7, F = 0, which is not a composite number. Therefore, Statement 7 is false.\n\nNow, let's check if there are any other possible solutions:\n\n- If T = 6, then F = 1. This satisfies Statement 2 (F ≤ 1).\n- If T = 6, Statement 3 (T = 5) is false, and Statement 4 (F = 2) is false. This satisfies Statement 5 because neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true.\n- If T = 6, Statement 6 is false because 6 is not a prime number.\n- If T = 6, F = 1, which is not a composite number. Therefore, Statement 7 is false.\n\nThus, the only possible solution is when T = 7 and F = 0. This satisfies all the conditions except Statement 7, which is false. Since we are looking for the number of possible solutions, and we found only one configuration that satisfies the maximum number of conditions, the number of possible solutions is 1.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
