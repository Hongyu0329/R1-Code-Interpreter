    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\n1. **Statement 1: 'At least 5 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - This implies that the number of true statements (T) is 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2: 'At most 4 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - This implies that the number of false statements (F) is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n3. **Statement 3: 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - This implies T = 1.\n\n4. **Statement 4: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - This implies F = 5, which means T = 2.\n\n5. **Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'**\n   - This implies that either Statement 3 is true (T = 1) or Statement 4 is true (T = 2), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'**\n   - Possible prime numbers for T are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'**\n   - Possible composite numbers for F are 4, 6, and 8.\n\nNow, let's analyze the consistency of these statements:\n\n- If T = 1 (Statement 3 is true), then F = 6, which is not a composite number. So, T cannot be 1.\n- If T = 2 (Statement 4 is true), then F = 5, which is not a composite number. So, T cannot be 2.\n- If T = 3, then F = 4, which is a composite number. This satisfies Statement 7, but it contradicts Statement 1 (since T is not at least 5).\n- If T = 5, then F = 2, which is not a composite number. So, T cannot be 5.\n- If T = 6, then F = 1, which is not a composite number. So, T cannot be 6.\n- If T = 7, then F = 0, which is not a composite number. So, T cannot be 7.\n\nThe only consistent solution is T = 3, which satisfies Statement 6 (since 3 is a prime number) and Statement 7 (since F = 4 is a composite number). However, this contradicts Statement 1, which requires at least 5 true statements.\n\nTherefore, there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\nThe number of possible solutions is:\n<<<0>>>"
