    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's evaluate each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1: 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - If this statement is true, then all 7 statements must be true. However, if all statements are true, Statement 4 ('Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false') would also be true, which is a contradiction. Therefore, Statement 1 cannot be true.\n\n2. **Statement 2: 'At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - If this statement is true, then at most 1 statement is false, meaning 6 or 7 statements are true. However, as analyzed above, 7 statements cannot be true. Therefore, if Statement 2 is true, exactly 6 statements must be true.\n\n3. **Statement 3: 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - If this statement is true, then exactly one statement is true, which would be Statement 3 itself. However, this would make Statement 5 false, as it requires either Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be true, but not both. Therefore, Statement 3 cannot be true.\n\n4. **Statement 4: 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - If this statement is true, then all statements are false, which is a contradiction because Statement 4 itself would be true. Therefore, Statement 4 cannot be true.\n\n5. **Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'**\n   - Since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 can be true, Statement 5 must be false.\n\n6. **Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'**\n   - Possible prime numbers for the number of true statements are 2, 3, 5, and 7. However, 7 true statements are not possible, and 5 true statements would contradict Statement 2. Therefore, the number of true statements could be 2 or 3.\n\n7. **Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'**\n   - Possible composite numbers for the number of false statements are 4, 6, etc. If there are 2 true statements, there would be 5 false statements, which is not composite. If there are 3 true statements, there would be 4 false statements, which is composite.\n\nFrom the analysis above, the only consistent scenario is having 3 true statements and 4 false statements. This satisfies:\n- Statement 2 being false (since more than 1 statement is false),\n- Statement 6 being true (3 is a prime number),\n- Statement 7 being true (4 is a composite number).\n\nThus, the number of possible solutions is 1, as only one configuration of truth values satisfies all conditions.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<1>>>."
