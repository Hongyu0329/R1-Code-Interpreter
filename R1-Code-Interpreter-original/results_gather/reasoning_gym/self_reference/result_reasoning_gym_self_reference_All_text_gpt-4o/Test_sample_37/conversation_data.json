    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's go through each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 1 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This implies that not all statements can be false. There must be at least one true statement.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means that there can be 0, 1, 2, or 3 false statements, which implies there can be 7, 6, 5, or 4 true statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This directly states that there are 4 true statements.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This directly states that there are 3 false statements, which means there are 4 true statements.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means that either there are exactly 4 true statements (Statement 3 is true) or exactly 3 false statements (Statement 4 is true), but not both. However, since both statements imply the same condition (4 true statements), this statement is inherently contradictory if both are considered true.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (from 1 to 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (from 0 to 7) are 4, 6, and 8.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If there are 4 true statements:\n  - Statement 3 is true.\n  - Statement 4 is true.\n  - Statement 5 is false (since both Statements 3 and 4 cannot be true simultaneously).\n  - Statement 6 is false (4 is not a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (3 false statements, and 3 is not a composite number, so this scenario is invalid).\n\n- If there are 3 true statements:\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is true (3 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is false (4 false statements, and 4 is a composite number, so this scenario is valid).\n\n- If there are 5 true statements:\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is true (5 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (2 false statements, and 2 is not a composite number, so this scenario is invalid).\n\n- If there are 6 true statements:\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is false (6 is not a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (1 false statement, and 1 is not a composite number, so this scenario is invalid).\n\n- If there are 7 true statements:\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is true (7 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is false (0 false statements, and 0 is not a composite number, so this scenario is invalid).\n\nAfter analyzing all scenarios, the only valid scenario is when there are 3 true statements. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
