    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's go through each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means there must be at least 2 true statements among the 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies that there can be 0 or 1 false statement, meaning there are at least 6 true statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means there are exactly 4 true statements.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means there are exactly 4 true statements (since 7 - 3 = 4).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Since both statements claim there are exactly 4 true statements, this condition cannot be satisfied if both are true.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (between 0 and 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (between 0 and 7) are 4, 6, and 8.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If there are 6 true statements (and 1 false statement):\n  - Statement 2 is true.\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is false (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is true (6 is not a prime number, so this is false).\n  - Statement 7 is false (1 is not a composite number).\n\n- If there are 5 true statements (and 2 false statements):\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is false.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is false (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is true (5 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is false (2 is not a composite number).\n\n- If there are 4 true statements (and 3 false statements):\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is false.\n  - Statement 3 is true.\n  - Statement 4 is true.\n  - Statement 5 is false (since both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true).\n  - Statement 6 is false (4 is not a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (3 is not a composite number).\n\n- If there are 3 true statements (and 4 false statements):\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is false.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is true.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false).\n  - Statement 6 is true (3 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (4 is a composite number).\n\n- If there are 2 true statements (and 5 false statements):\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is false.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is false (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is true (2 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (5 is not a composite number).\n\nFrom the analysis, the only scenario that satisfies all conditions is when there are 3 true statements and 4 false statements. Therefore, there is only one possible solution.\n\nThe number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
