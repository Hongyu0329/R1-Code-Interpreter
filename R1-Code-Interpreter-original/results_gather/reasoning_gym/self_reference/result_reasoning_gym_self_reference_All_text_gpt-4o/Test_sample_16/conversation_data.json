    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement and determine the number of true and false statements that satisfy all conditions.\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This implies that there are either 6 or 7 true statements.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 7 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This is trivially true because there are only 7 statements, so at most all of them can be false.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This implies that there are 5 true statements.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies that there are 5 true statements (since 7 - 2 = 5).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means one of them is true, and the other is false. Since both Statements 3 and 4 imply 5 true statements, this condition is satisfied if there are exactly 5 true statements.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - Prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - Composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1**: 6 true statements\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 3 is false (since it claims exactly 5 true statements).\n  - Statement 4 is false (since it claims exactly 2 false statements, which would mean 5 true statements).\n  - Statement 5 is false (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is true (since 6 is not a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is false (since 1 false statement is not a composite number).\n\n  This scenario does not satisfy all conditions.\n\n- **Scenario 2**: 7 true statements\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is false.\n  - Statement 6 is false (since 7 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is false (since 0 false statements is not a composite number).\n\n  This scenario does not satisfy all conditions.\n\n- **Scenario 3**: 5 true statements\n  - Statement 1 is false (since it requires at least 6 true statements).\n  - Statement 3 is true.\n  - Statement 4 is true.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both).\n  - Statement 6 is true (since 5 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (since 2 false statements is a composite number).\n\n  This scenario satisfies all conditions.\n\n- **Scenario 4**: 2 true statements\n  - Statement 1 is false.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is false.\n  - Statement 6 is true (since 2 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (since 5 false statements is a composite number).\n\n  This scenario does not satisfy all conditions.\n\n- **Scenario 5**: 3 true statements\n  - Statement 1 is false.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is false.\n  - Statement 6 is true (since 3 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (since 4 false statements is a composite number).\n\n  This scenario does not satisfy all conditions.\n\n- **Scenario 6**: 4 true statements\n  - Statement 1 is false.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is false.\n  - Statement 6 is false (since 4 is not a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (since 3 false statements is not a composite number).\n\n  This scenario does not satisfy all conditions.\n\nThe only scenario that satisfies all conditions is Scenario 3, where there are 5 true statements.\n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
