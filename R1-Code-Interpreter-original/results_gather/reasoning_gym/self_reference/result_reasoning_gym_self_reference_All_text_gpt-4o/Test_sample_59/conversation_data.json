    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine how many of them can be true simultaneously. Let's evaluate each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then there are either 6 or 7 true statements.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then there are either 0 or 1 false statements, meaning there are 6 or 7 true statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 6 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then there are exactly 6 true statements.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then there are exactly 2 true statements.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This is a logical XOR condition. If Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 must be false, and vice versa.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (from 0 to 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (from 0 to 7) are 4, 6, and 8.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1**: 7 true statements\n  - Statement 1: True\n  - Statement 2: True\n  - Statement 3: False (contradicts itself)\n  - Statement 4: False\n  - Statement 5: False (neither Statement 3 nor 4 is true)\n  - Statement 6: True (7 is a prime number)\n  - Statement 7: False (0 is not a composite number)\n  - This scenario is not possible because Statement 7 would be false.\n\n- **Scenario 2**: 6 true statements\n  - Statement 1: True\n  - Statement 2: True\n  - Statement 3: True\n  - Statement 4: False\n  - Statement 5: True (Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is false)\n  - Statement 6: True (6 is not a prime number, so this is false)\n  - Statement 7: True (1 is not a composite number, so this is false)\n  - This scenario is not possible because Statement 6 would be false.\n\n- **Scenario 3**: 5 true statements\n  - Statement 1: False\n  - Statement 2: False\n  - Statement 3: False\n  - Statement 4: False\n  - Statement 5: False\n  - Statement 6: True (5 is a prime number)\n  - Statement 7: True (2 is not a composite number, so this is false)\n  - This scenario is not possible because Statement 7 would be false.\n\n- **Scenario 4**: 4 true statements\n  - Statement 1: False\n  - Statement 2: False\n  - Statement 3: False\n  - Statement 4: False\n  - Statement 5: False\n  - Statement 6: False (4 is not a prime number)\n  - Statement 7: True (3 is not a composite number, so this is false)\n  - This scenario is not possible because Statement 6 would be false.\n\n- **Scenario 5**: 3 true statements\n  - Statement 1: False\n  - Statement 2: False\n  - Statement 3: False\n  - Statement 4: False\n  - Statement 5: False\n  - Statement 6: True (3 is a prime number)\n  - Statement 7: True (4 is a composite number)\n  - This scenario is possible.\n\n- **Scenario 6**: 2 true statements\n  - Statement 1: False\n  - Statement 2: False\n  - Statement 3: False\n  - Statement 4: True\n  - Statement 5: True (Statement 4 is true, Statement 3 is false)\n  - Statement 6: False (2 is a prime number)\n  - Statement 7: True (5 is not a composite number, so this is false)\n  - This scenario is not possible because Statement 6 would be false.\n\n- **Scenario 7**: 1 true statement\n  - Statement 1: False\n  - Statement 2: False\n  - Statement 3: False\n  - Statement 4: False\n  - Statement 5: False\n  - Statement 6: False (1 is not a prime number)\n  - Statement 7: True (6 is a composite number)\n  - This scenario is not possible because Statement 6 would be false.\n\n- **Scenario 8**: 0 true statements\n  - Statement 1: False\n  - Statement 2: False\n  - Statement 3: False\n  - Statement 4: False\n  - Statement 5: False\n  - Statement 6: False (0 is not a prime number)\n  - Statement 7: False (7 is not a composite number)\n  - This scenario is not possible because Statement 7 would be false.\n\nAfter analyzing all scenarios, the only possible solution is Scenario 5, where there are 3 true statements.\n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
