    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine how many of them can be true simultaneously. Let's go through each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 5 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then there are at least 5 true statements.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 0 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then all statements are true, which contradicts the possibility of having any false statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then exactly 5 statements are true.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then exactly 3 statements are true.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This statement implies that either Statement 3 is true or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (out of 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (out of 7) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1**: Assume Statement 1 is true.\n  - At least 5 statements are true.\n  - If 5 statements are true, then 2 are false. This makes Statement 7 false because 2 is not a composite number.\n  - If 6 statements are true, then 1 is false. This makes Statement 7 false because 1 is not a composite number.\n  - If 7 statements are true, then 0 are false. This makes Statement 2 true, which contradicts the assumption that not all statements can be true.\n\n- **Scenario 2**: Assume Statement 3 is true.\n  - Exactly 5 statements are true.\n  - This makes Statement 4 false.\n  - Statement 5 is true because it states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n  - Statement 6 is true because 5 is a prime number.\n  - Statement 7 is false because 2 (the number of false statements) is not a composite number.\n\n- **Scenario 3**: Assume Statement 4 is true.\n  - Exactly 4 statements are false.\n  - This makes Statement 3 false.\n  - Statement 5 is true because it states that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n  - Statement 6 is false because 3 (the number of true statements) is a prime number, but we need 4 true statements for Statement 4 to be true.\n  - Statement 7 is true because 4 (the number of false statements) is a composite number.\n\nFrom the analysis, we find that:\n\n- In Scenario 2, Statements 3, 5, and 6 are true, while Statements 1, 2, 4, and 7 are false.\n- In Scenario 3, Statements 4, 5, and 7 are true, while Statements 1, 2, 3, and 6 are false.\n\nBoth scenarios are consistent with the conditions given, and each scenario provides a valid solution. Therefore, there are two possible solutions.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
