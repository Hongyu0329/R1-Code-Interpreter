    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\n1. **Statement 1: 'At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - If this statement is true, then there are either 6 or 7 true statements.\n\n2. **Statement 2: 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - If this statement is true, then there are 0, 1, or 2 false statements, which means there are 5, 6, or 7 true statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3: 'Exactly 6 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - If this statement is true, then there are exactly 6 true statements.\n\n4. **Statement 4: 'Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - If this statement is true, then all 7 statements are true.\n\n5. **Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'**\n   - This means that either Statement 3 is true (exactly 6 true statements) or Statement 4 is true (exactly 7 true statements), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'**\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'**\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1: 7 true statements**\n  - If all 7 statements are true, then Statement 4 is true, and Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 5 would be true because it allows for either Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be true, but not both.\n  - Statement 6 is true because 7 is a prime number.\n  - Statement 7 is false because 0 false statements is not a composite number.\n  - This scenario is not possible because Statement 7 would be false, contradicting the assumption that all statements are true.\n\n- **Scenario 2: 6 true statements**\n  - If there are 6 true statements, then 1 statement is false.\n  - Statement 3 is true, and Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is true because it allows for either Statement 3 or Statement 4 to be true, but not both.\n  - Statement 6 is true because 6 is not a prime number, so it must be false, which is consistent with having 6 true statements.\n  - Statement 7 is true because 1 false statement is not a composite number, so it must be false, which is consistent with having 6 true statements.\n  - This scenario is possible.\n\n- **Scenario 3: 5 true statements**\n  - If there are 5 true statements, then 2 statements are false.\n  - Statement 3 is false, and Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is false because neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true.\n  - Statement 6 is true because 5 is a prime number.\n  - Statement 7 is false because 2 false statements is not a composite number.\n  - This scenario is not possible because Statement 7 would be false, contradicting the assumption that all statements are true.\n\n- **Scenario 4: 4 true statements**\n  - If there are 4 true statements, then 3 statements are false.\n  - Statement 3 is false, and Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is false because neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true.\n  - Statement 6 is false because 4 is not a prime number.\n  - Statement 7 is true because 3 false statements is not a composite number, so it must be false, which is consistent with having 4 true statements.\n  - This scenario is not possible because Statement 6 would be false, contradicting the assumption that all statements are true.\n\n- **Scenario 5: 3 true statements**\n  - If there are 3 true statements, then 4 statements are false.\n  - Statement 3 is false, and Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is false because neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true.\n  - Statement 6 is true because 3 is a prime number.\n  - Statement 7 is true because 4 false statements is a composite number.\n  - This scenario is possible.\n\n- **Scenario 6: 2 true statements**\n  - If there are 2 true statements, then 5 statements are false.\n  - Statement 3 is false, and Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is false because neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true.\n  - Statement 6 is true because 2 is a prime number.\n  - Statement 7 is false because 5 false statements is not a composite number.\n  - This scenario is not possible because Statement 7 would be false, contradicting the assumption that all statements are true.\n\n- **Scenario 7: 1 true statement**\n  - If there is 1 true statement, then 6 statements are false.\n  - Statement 3 is false, and Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is false because neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true.\n  - Statement 6 is false because 1 is not a prime number.\n  - Statement 7 is true because 6 false statements is a composite number.\n  - This scenario is not possible because Statement 6 would be false, contradicting the assumption that all statements are true.\n\n- **Scenario 8: 0 true statements**\n  - If there are 0 true statements, then 7 statements are false.\n  - Statement 3 is false, and Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is false because neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true.\n  - Statement 6 is false because 0 is not a prime number.\n  - Statement 7 is false because 7 false statements is not a composite number.\n  - This scenario is not possible because Statement 6 and Statement 7 would be false, contradicting the assumption that all statements are true.\n\nAfter analyzing all scenarios, we find that there are two possible solutions: Scenario 2 (6 true statements) and Scenario 5 (3 true statements).\n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
