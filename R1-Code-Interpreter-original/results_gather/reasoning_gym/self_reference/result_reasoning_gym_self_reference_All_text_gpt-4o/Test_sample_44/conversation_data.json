    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's evaluate each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1: 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - If this statement is true, then all 7 statements must be true. However, this creates a contradiction because some statements (like Statement 3 and Statement 4) cannot be true simultaneously. Therefore, Statement 1 must be false.\n\n2. **Statement 2: 'At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - If this statement is true, then at most 1 statement is false. Since we already determined that Statement 1 is false, this means Statement 2 must also be false because more than 1 statement is false.\n\n3. **Statement 3: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - If this statement is true, then exactly 2 statements are true. We need to check if this is consistent with other statements.\n\n4. **Statement 4: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - If this statement is true, then exactly 4 statements are false. We need to check if this is consistent with other statements.\n\n5. **Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'**\n   - This statement implies that either Statement 3 is true or Statement 4 is true, but not both. We need to evaluate the scenarios where one is true and the other is false.\n\n6. **Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'**\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (out of 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7. We need to check which of these is consistent with other statements.\n\n7. **Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'**\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (out of 7) are 4 and 6. We need to check which of these is consistent with other statements.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1: Statement 3 is true (exactly 2 statements are true).**\n  - If Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 must be false (due to Statement 5).\n  - This means there are 5 false statements.\n  - Statement 6 would be false because 2 is a prime number.\n  - Statement 7 would be true because 5 is a composite number.\n  - The true statements would be Statement 3 and Statement 7.\n\n- **Scenario 2: Statement 4 is true (exactly 4 statements are false).**\n  - If Statement 4 is true, then Statement 3 must be false (due to Statement 5).\n  - This means there are 3 true statements.\n  - Statement 6 would be true because 3 is a prime number.\n  - Statement 7 would be false because 4 is a composite number.\n  - The true statements would be Statement 4, Statement 6, and one more statement.\n\nIn both scenarios, we find that the conditions can be satisfied, but only one scenario can be true at a time due to the exclusivity in Statement 5. Therefore, there are two possible solutions:\n\n- One where Statement 3 and Statement 7 are true.\n- One where Statement 4 and Statement 6 are true.\n\nThus, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
