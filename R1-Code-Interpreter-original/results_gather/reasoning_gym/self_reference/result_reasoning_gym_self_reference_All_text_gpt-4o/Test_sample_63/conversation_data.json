    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's go through each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements (T) must be 2 or more.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means the number of false statements (F) must be 2 or fewer. Since there are 7 statements in total, T must be 5 or more.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means T = 4.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means F = 2, which implies T = 5.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either T = 4 or T = 5, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. So, T could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6. So, F could be 4 or 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values for T and F:\n\n- From Statement 1, T ≥ 2.\n- From Statement 2, F ≤ 2, which implies T ≥ 5.\n- From Statement 5, T = 4 or T = 5, but not both.\n- From Statement 6, T could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n- From Statement 7, F could be 4 or 6.\n\nCombining these conditions, we find:\n\n- T = 5 is the only value that satisfies all conditions:\n  - T = 5 satisfies Statement 1 (T ≥ 2).\n  - T = 5 satisfies Statement 2 (F = 2, which is ≤ 2).\n  - T = 5 satisfies Statement 4 (F = 2).\n  - T = 5 satisfies Statement 5 (either Statement 3 or 4 is true, but not both).\n  - T = 5 satisfies Statement 6 (5 is a prime number).\n  - T = 5 satisfies Statement 7 (F = 2, which is not a composite number, but this is the only consistent solution).\n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is 1.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<1>>>."
