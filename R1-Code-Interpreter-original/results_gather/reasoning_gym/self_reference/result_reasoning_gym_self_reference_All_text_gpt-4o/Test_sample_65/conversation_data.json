    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\n1. **Statement 1: 'At least 5 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - This implies that the number of true statements (T) is 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2: 'At most 0 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - This implies that the number of false statements (F) is 0. Therefore, all statements must be true.\n\n3. **Statement 3: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - This implies that T = 5.\n\n4. **Statement 4: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - This implies that F = 5, which is impossible since there are only 7 statements.\n\n5. **Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'**\n   - This means either Statement 3 is true (T = 5) or Statement 4 is true (F = 5), but not both. Since F = 5 is impossible, Statement 3 must be true.\n\n6. **Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'**\n   - Prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. Since Statement 3 is true, T = 5, which is a prime number.\n\n7. **Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'**\n   - Composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6. If T = 5, then F = 2, which is not a composite number. Therefore, Statement 7 must be false.\n\nNow, let's verify the consistency of these statements:\n\n- If T = 5, then Statements 1, 3, and 6 are true.\n- Statement 2 is false because not all statements are true.\n- Statement 4 is false because F â‰  5.\n- Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 7 is false because F = 2 is not a composite number.\n\nThus, the configuration where T = 5 and F = 2 satisfies all the conditions. There is only one possible solution that satisfies all the given statements.\n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
