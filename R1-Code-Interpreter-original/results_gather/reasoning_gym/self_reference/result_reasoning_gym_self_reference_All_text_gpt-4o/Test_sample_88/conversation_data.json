    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's go through each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1: 'At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - If this statement is true, then there are either 6 or 7 true statements.\n\n2. **Statement 2: 'At most 4 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - If this statement is true, then there are 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 false statements, which means there are 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 true statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - If this statement is true, then there are exactly 5 true statements.\n\n4. **Statement 4: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - If this statement is true, then there are exactly 5 true statements (since 7 - 2 = 5).\n\n5. **Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'**\n   - This means that either Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false, or Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false.\n\n6. **Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'**\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (out of 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'**\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (out of 7) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1: 6 true statements, 1 false statement**\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is true.\n  - Statement 3 is false (since it claims exactly 5 true statements).\n  - Statement 4 is false (since it claims exactly 2 false statements).\n  - Statement 5 is false (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is true (6 is not a prime number, so this scenario is invalid).\n  - Statement 7 is false (1 is not a composite number).\n\n- **Scenario 2: 5 true statements, 2 false statements**\n  - Statement 1 is false (since it claims at least 6 true statements).\n  - Statement 2 is true.\n  - Statement 3 is true.\n  - Statement 4 is true.\n  - Statement 5 is false (since both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true).\n  - Statement 6 is true (5 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (2 is not a composite number, so this scenario is invalid).\n\n- **Scenario 3: 4 true statements, 3 false statements**\n  - Statement 1 is false.\n  - Statement 2 is true.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is false (4 is not a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (3 is not a composite number, so this scenario is invalid).\n\n- **Scenario 4: 3 true statements, 4 false statements**\n  - Statement 1 is false.\n  - Statement 2 is true.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is true (3 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (4 is a composite number).\n\nIn Scenario 4, all conditions are satisfied, and it is the only valid scenario. Therefore, there is only one possible solution.\n\nThe number of possible solutions is: <<<1>>>."
