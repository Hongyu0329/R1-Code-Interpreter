    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's go through each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements (T) is \\( T \\geq 3 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means the number of false statements (F) is \\( F \\leq 3 \\).\n   - Since there are 7 statements in total, \\( T = 7 - F \\). Therefore, \\( T \\geq 4 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This implies \\( T = 4 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies \\( F = 3 \\), which means \\( T = 4 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either \\( T = 4 \\) (Statement 3 is true) or \\( F = 3 \\) (Statement 4 is true), but not both simultaneously.\n   - Since both conditions imply \\( T = 4 \\), Statement 5 cannot be true if both are true. Therefore, one of them must be false.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - Possible prime numbers for \\( T \\) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - Possible composite numbers for \\( F \\) are 4, 6, etc.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **If \\( T = 4 \\)**:\n  - Statement 3 is true.\n  - Statement 4 is true.\n  - Statement 5 is false (since both Statements 3 and 4 cannot be true simultaneously).\n  - Statement 6 is false (4 is not a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (since \\( F = 3 \\), which is not composite, this scenario is invalid).\n\n- **If \\( T = 5 \\)**:\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is false (since \\( F = 2 \\)).\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since neither Statement 3 nor 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is true (5 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is false (since \\( F = 2 \\), which is not composite).\n\n- **If \\( T = 6 \\)**:\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is false (since \\( F = 1 \\)).\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since neither Statement 3 nor 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is false (6 is not a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (since \\( F = 1 \\), which is not composite, this scenario is invalid).\n\n- **If \\( T = 7 \\)**:\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is false (since \\( F = 0 \\)).\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since neither Statement 3 nor 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is false (7 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is false (since \\( F = 0 \\), which is not composite).\n\nFrom the analysis, the only valid scenario is when \\( T = 5 \\). Therefore, there is only one possible solution.\n\nThe number of possible solutions is: <<<1>>>."
