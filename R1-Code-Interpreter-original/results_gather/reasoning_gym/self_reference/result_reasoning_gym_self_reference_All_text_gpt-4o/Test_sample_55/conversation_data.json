    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement and determine the number of true and false statements that satisfy all conditions.\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This implies all 7 statements are true.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 statements can be false, which implies at least 2 statements are true.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means 3 statements are true and 4 are false.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This is a contradiction because if all statements are false, then Statement 4 itself cannot be true.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means one of them is true, but not both. If Statement 4 is true, it leads to a contradiction as noted above, so Statement 3 must be true.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - Possible prime numbers for the number of true statements are 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - Possible composite numbers for the number of false statements are 4, 6, or 8.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **If Statement 1 is true**: All 7 statements are true, which contradicts Statement 4 and Statement 3. Therefore, Statement 1 cannot be true.\n\n- **If Statement 2 is true**: At most 5 statements are false, meaning at least 2 are true.\n\n- **If Statement 3 is true**: Exactly 3 statements are true. This satisfies Statement 5 (since Statement 4 is false), and it also satisfies Statement 6 (3 is a prime number).\n\n- **If Statement 4 is true**: All statements are false, which is a contradiction.\n\n- **If Statement 5 is true**: Statement 3 is true, and Statement 4 is false.\n\n- **If Statement 6 is true**: The number of true statements is a prime number. If Statement 3 is true, then 3 true statements satisfy this.\n\n- **If Statement 7 is true**: The number of false statements is a composite number. If Statement 3 is true, then 4 false statements satisfy this.\n\nFrom the above analysis, the only consistent scenario is when Statement 3 is true, which means exactly 3 statements are true. This satisfies all the conditions:\n\n- Statement 1 is false.\n- Statement 2 is true (since 4 statements are false, which is at most 5).\n- Statement 3 is true.\n- Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 5 is true (since Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false).\n- Statement 6 is true (3 is a prime number).\n- Statement 7 is true (4 is a composite number).\n\nThus, there is only one possible solution where exactly 3 statements are true.\n\nThe number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
