    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement and determine the number of possible solutions where all statements are consistent with each other.\n\n1. **Statement 1: 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - This implies that all 7 statements are true.\n\n2. **Statement 2: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - This means that there can be 0, 1, 2, or 3 false statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - This means that 3 statements are false.\n\n4. **Statement 4: 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - This is a contradiction because if all statements are false, then this statement itself cannot be true.\n\n5. **Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'**\n   - This means that either Statement 3 is true (4 true statements) or Statement 4 is true (7 false statements), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'**\n   - Possible prime numbers for the number of true statements are 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'**\n   - Possible composite numbers for the number of false statements are 4, 6, or 8.\n\nNow, let's analyze the consistency of these statements:\n\n- If Statement 1 is true, then all 7 statements are true. This contradicts Statement 4, which cannot be true if all statements are true. Also, Statement 3 cannot be true if all statements are true. Therefore, Statement 1 cannot be true.\n\n- If Statement 2 is true, then there can be 0, 1, 2, or 3 false statements. This is consistent with Statement 3 being true (3 false statements).\n\n- If Statement 3 is true, then there are exactly 4 true statements. This is consistent with Statement 5, as Statement 4 would be false.\n\n- If Statement 4 is true, then all statements are false, which is a contradiction. Therefore, Statement 4 cannot be true.\n\n- If Statement 5 is true, then either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Since Statement 4 cannot be true, Statement 3 must be true.\n\n- If Statement 6 is true, then the number of true statements is a prime number. If Statement 3 is true, there are 4 true statements, which is not a prime number. Therefore, Statement 6 cannot be true.\n\n- If Statement 7 is true, then the number of false statements is a composite number. If Statement 3 is true, there are 3 false statements, which is not a composite number. Therefore, Statement 7 cannot be true.\n\nFrom this analysis, the only consistent scenario is when Statement 3 is true, which means there are exactly 4 true statements and 3 false statements. This satisfies Statement 2 and Statement 5, but not Statement 6 or Statement 7.\n\nTherefore, there is only one possible solution where the statements are consistent with each other.\n\nThe number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
