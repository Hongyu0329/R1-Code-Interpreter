    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine how many of them can be true simultaneously. Let's go through each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means there are 4, 5, 6, or 7 true statements.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means there are 0 or 1 false statements, which implies 6 or 7 true statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means there are exactly 4 true statements.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means there are exactly 4 true statements (since 7 - 3 = 4).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Since both statements imply 4 true statements, this condition is automatically satisfied if there are exactly 4 true statements.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (out of 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (out of 7) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1**: 4 true statements\n  - Statement 1: True (4 is at least 4)\n  - Statement 2: False (4 true statements mean 3 false, not at most 1 false)\n  - Statement 3: True (exactly 4 true)\n  - Statement 4: True (exactly 3 false)\n  - Statement 5: False (both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are true)\n  - Statement 6: True (4 is not a prime number, so this is false)\n  - Statement 7: True (3 false statements, 3 is not composite, so this is false)\n\n  In this scenario, Statements 1, 3, and 4 are true, which means 3 true statements. This contradicts the requirement of 4 true statements, so this scenario is not possible.\n\n- **Scenario 2**: 5 true statements\n  - Statement 1: True (5 is at least 4)\n  - Statement 2: False (5 true statements mean 2 false, not at most 1 false)\n  - Statement 3: False (not exactly 4 true)\n  - Statement 4: False (not exactly 3 false)\n  - Statement 5: True (neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true)\n  - Statement 6: True (5 is a prime number)\n  - Statement 7: False (2 false statements, 2 is not composite)\n\n  In this scenario, Statements 1, 5, and 6 are true, which means 3 true statements. This contradicts the requirement of 5 true statements, so this scenario is not possible.\n\n- **Scenario 3**: 6 true statements\n  - Statement 1: True (6 is at least 4)\n  - Statement 2: True (6 true statements mean 1 false, which is at most 1 false)\n  - Statement 3: False (not exactly 4 true)\n  - Statement 4: False (not exactly 3 false)\n  - Statement 5: True (neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true)\n  - Statement 6: False (6 is not a prime number)\n  - Statement 7: True (1 false statement, 1 is not composite, so this is false)\n\n  In this scenario, Statements 1, 2, and 5 are true, which means 3 true statements. This contradicts the requirement of 6 true statements, so this scenario is not possible.\n\n- **Scenario 4**: 7 true statements\n  - Statement 1: True (7 is at least 4)\n  - Statement 2: True (7 true statements mean 0 false, which is at most 1 false)\n  - Statement 3: False (not exactly 4 true)\n  - Statement 4: False (not exactly 3 false)\n  - Statement 5: True (neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true)\n  - Statement 6: True (7 is a prime number)\n  - Statement 7: False (0 false statements, 0 is not composite)\n\n  In this scenario, Statements 1, 2, 5, and 6 are true, which means 4 true statements. This contradicts the requirement of 7 true statements, so this scenario is not possible.\n\nAfter analyzing all possible scenarios, we find that none of them satisfy all the conditions simultaneously. Therefore, there are no possible solutions.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
