    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's go through each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1: 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - This implies that all 7 statements are true. If this statement is true, then all statements must be true.\n\n2. **Statement 2: 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - This means that 0, 1, or 2 statements can be false. If this statement is true, then the number of false statements is 0, 1, or 2.\n\n3. **Statement 3: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - This means that 5 statements are true and 2 are false.\n\n4. **Statement 4: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - This means that 5 statements are true and 2 are false.\n\n5. **Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'**\n   - This means that either Statement 3 is true or Statement 4 is true, but not both simultaneously.\n\n6. **Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'**\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (out of 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'**\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (out of 7) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **If Statement 1 is true:** All 7 statements are true. This contradicts Statement 5, which requires either Statement 3 or 4 to be true, but not both. Therefore, Statement 1 cannot be true.\n\n- **If Statement 2 is true:** 0, 1, or 2 statements are false. This means 5, 6, or 7 statements are true.\n\n- **If Statement 3 is true:** Exactly 5 statements are true. This implies 2 statements are false.\n\n- **If Statement 4 is true:** Exactly 2 statements are false. This implies 5 statements are true.\n\n- **If Statement 5 is true:** Either Statement 3 or 4 is true, but not both. This means exactly 5 statements are true, and 2 are false.\n\n- **If Statement 6 is true:** The number of true statements is a prime number. Possible values are 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n- **If Statement 7 is true:** The number of false statements is a composite number. Possible values are 4 or 6.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can deduce:\n\n- If 5 statements are true (and 2 are false), then:\n  - Statement 3 is true.\n  - Statement 4 is true.\n  - Statement 5 is false (since both 3 and 4 are true).\n  - Statement 6 is true (5 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is false (2 is not a composite number).\n\nThis scenario satisfies the conditions for Statements 2, 3, 4, and 6. However, it contradicts Statement 5, which requires either Statement 3 or 4 to be true, but not both.\n\n- If 6 statements are true (and 1 is false), then:\n  - Statement 1 is false.\n  - Statement 2 is true.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since neither 3 nor 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is true (6 is not a prime number, so this is false).\n  - Statement 7 is true (1 is not a composite number, so this is false).\n\nThis scenario does not satisfy the conditions for Statements 6 and 7.\n\n- If 7 statements are true (and 0 are false), then:\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is true.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is false (since neither 3 nor 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is true (7 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is false (0 is not a composite number).\n\nThis scenario does not satisfy the conditions for Statement 5.\n\nAfter analyzing all possible scenarios, we find that there is no consistent solution that satisfies all the given statements. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
