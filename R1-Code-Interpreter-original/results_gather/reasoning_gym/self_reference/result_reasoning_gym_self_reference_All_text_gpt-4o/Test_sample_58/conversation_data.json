    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's go through each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements (T) must be 2 or more.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 4 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means the number of false statements (F) must be 4 or fewer. Since there are 7 statements in total, T = 7 - F, so T must be 3 or more.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means T = 5.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means F = 2, so T = 5.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either T = 5 (Statement 3 is true) or F = 2 (Statement 4 is true), but not both simultaneously.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. So, T must be one of these values.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6. So, F must be one of these values.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values for T and F:\n\n- If T = 5, then F = 2. This satisfies Statement 3 and Statement 4, but Statement 5 requires that only one of them is true, so this is not possible.\n- If T = 3, then F = 4. This satisfies Statement 2, Statement 6 (since 3 is prime), and Statement 7 (since 4 is composite). However, it does not satisfy Statement 3 or Statement 4, so Statement 5 is not satisfied.\n- If T = 2, then F = 5. This satisfies Statement 1, but not Statement 2, Statement 6, or Statement 7.\n- If T = 7, then F = 0. This satisfies Statement 6, but not Statement 2 or Statement 7.\n\nThe only possible value that satisfies all conditions is T = 3 and F = 4. This satisfies:\n- Statement 1: At least 2 statements are true.\n- Statement 2: At most 4 statements are false.\n- Statement 6: The number of true statements is a prime number.\n- Statement 7: The number of false statements is a composite number.\n\nHowever, it does not satisfy Statement 5, as neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true. Therefore, there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions.\n\nThus, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
