    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's evaluate each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1: 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - If this statement is true, then all 7 statements must be true. However, if all statements are true, Statement 3 ('Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true.') would be false, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, Statement 1 cannot be true.\n\n2. **Statement 2: 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - If this statement is true, then there can be 0, 1, or 2 false statements. We will consider these cases later.\n\n3. **Statement 3: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - If this statement is true, then exactly 2 statements are true, and the rest (5 statements) are false. This would make Statement 4 ('Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are false.') false, which is consistent with Statement 5 ('Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.') being true.\n\n4. **Statement 4: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - If this statement is true, then exactly 4 statements are false, and the rest (3 statements) are true. This would make Statement 3 false, which is consistent with Statement 5 being true.\n\n5. **Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'**\n   - This statement is a logical XOR between Statement 3 and Statement 4. If Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 must be false, and vice versa.\n\n6. **Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'**\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (out of 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'**\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (out of 7) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1: Exactly 2 statements are true.**\n  - This satisfies Statement 3.\n  - Statement 4 is false, which satisfies Statement 5.\n  - The number of true statements (2) is a prime number, satisfying Statement 6.\n  - The number of false statements (5) is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false.\n  - This scenario is consistent with Statement 2 being true (at most 2 false statements).\n\n- **Scenario 2: Exactly 3 statements are true.**\n  - This satisfies Statement 4.\n  - Statement 3 is false, which satisfies Statement 5.\n  - The number of true statements (3) is a prime number, satisfying Statement 6.\n  - The number of false statements (4) is a composite number, satisfying Statement 7.\n  - This scenario is consistent with Statement 2 being true (at most 2 false statements).\n\n- **Scenario 3: Exactly 5 statements are true.**\n  - This does not satisfy Statement 3 or Statement 4, making Statement 5 false.\n  - The number of true statements (5) is a prime number, satisfying Statement 6.\n  - The number of false statements (2) is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false.\n  - This scenario is consistent with Statement 2 being true (at most 2 false statements).\n\n- **Scenario 4: Exactly 7 statements are true.**\n  - This would make Statement 1 true, but as analyzed, it leads to a contradiction.\n\nFrom the analysis, only Scenarios 1 and 2 satisfy all the conditions without contradictions. Therefore, there are 2 possible solutions.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<2>>>."
