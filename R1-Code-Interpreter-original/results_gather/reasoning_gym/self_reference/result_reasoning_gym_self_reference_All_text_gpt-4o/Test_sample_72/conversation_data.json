    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's go through each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements (T) is at least 3. So, \\( T \\geq 3 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means the number of false statements (F) is at most 5. So, \\( F \\leq 5 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then all statements are true, which contradicts the possibility of any statement being false. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then there is exactly 1 false statement, meaning \\( F = 1 \\).\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - Since Statement 3 cannot be true, Statement 4 must be true if Statement 5 is true. Therefore, \\( F = 1 \\).\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The possible values for T (number of true statements) are 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. Among these, the prime numbers are 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The possible values for F (number of false statements) are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Among these, the composite numbers are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the constraints:\n\n- From Statement 1, \\( T \\geq 3 \\).\n- From Statement 2, \\( F \\leq 5 \\).\n- From Statement 5, since Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 must be true, so \\( F = 1 \\).\n- From Statement 6, \\( T \\) must be a prime number, so \\( T = 3, 5, \\) or \\( 7 \\).\n- From Statement 7, \\( F \\) must be a composite number, but since \\( F = 1 \\) from Statement 5, this contradicts Statement 7.\n\nSince Statement 7 cannot be true if \\( F = 1 \\), we need to check if there is any consistent solution:\n\n- If \\( F = 1 \\), then \\( T = 6 \\), which is not a prime number, contradicting Statement 6.\n- If \\( F = 2 \\), then \\( T = 5 \\), which is a prime number, but this contradicts Statement 5 because it requires \\( F = 1 \\).\n\nGiven these contradictions, there is no consistent solution that satisfies all the statements simultaneously.\n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
