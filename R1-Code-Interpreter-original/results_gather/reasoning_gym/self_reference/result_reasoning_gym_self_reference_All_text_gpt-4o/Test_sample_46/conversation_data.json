    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's go through each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means that the number of true statements (T) must be at least 2.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies that the number of false statements (F) is at most 2, so F ≤ 2. Since there are 7 statements in total, T = 7 - F, which means T ≥ 5.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 6 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means T = 6.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means F = 3, which implies T = 4.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either T = 6 or T = 4, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. So, T must be one of these values.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6. So, F must be one of these values.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values for T and F:\n\n- From Statement 2, T ≥ 5.\n- From Statement 6, T must be a prime number: 5 or 7.\n- From Statement 7, F must be a composite number: 4 or 6.\n\nLet's check each possibility:\n\n- **If T = 5**: \n  - Then F = 7 - 5 = 2, which is not a composite number. So, this does not satisfy Statement 7.\n\n- **If T = 7**:\n  - Then F = 7 - 7 = 0, which is not a composite number. So, this does not satisfy Statement 7.\n\nSince neither T = 5 nor T = 7 satisfies all conditions, let's consider the implications of Statements 3, 4, and 5:\n\n- **If Statement 3 is true (T = 6)**:\n  - Then Statement 4 must be false (F ≠ 3), and F = 1.\n  - F = 1 is not a composite number, so this does not satisfy Statement 7.\n\n- **If Statement 4 is true (T = 4)**:\n  - Then Statement 3 must be false (T ≠ 6), and F = 3.\n  - F = 3 is not a composite number, so this does not satisfy Statement 7.\n\nSince none of the scenarios satisfy all the conditions, there are no possible solutions that meet all the given statements.\n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
