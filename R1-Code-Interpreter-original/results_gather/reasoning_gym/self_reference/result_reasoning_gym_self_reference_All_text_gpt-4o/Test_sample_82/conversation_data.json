    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's go through each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements (T) is 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means the number of false statements (F) is 0, 1, or 2. Since there are 7 statements in total, T can be 5, 6, or 7.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 6 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means T = 6.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 1 of these 7 statements is false.\"\n   - This means F = 1, so T = 6.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either T = 6 (Statement 3 is true) or F = 1 (Statement 4 is true), but not both. Since both statements imply T = 6, this condition is automatically satisfied if T = 6.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The prime numbers between 0 and 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. Since T = 6 is not a prime number, Statement 6 must be false.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The composite numbers between 0 and 7 are 4, 6, 8, etc. Since F = 1 (from T = 6), which is not composite, Statement 7 must be false.\n\nNow, let's analyze the consistency of these statements:\n\n- If T = 6, then Statements 3 and 4 are both true, which contradicts Statement 5. Therefore, T cannot be 6.\n- If T = 5, then F = 2, which satisfies Statement 2. However, Statement 3 would be false, Statement 4 would be false, and Statement 5 would be false. Statement 6 would be true (since 5 is prime), and Statement 7 would be false (since 2 is not composite). This configuration does not satisfy all conditions.\n- If T = 7, then F = 0, which satisfies Statement 2. However, Statement 3 would be false, Statement 4 would be false, and Statement 5 would be false. Statement 6 would be false (since 7 is prime), and Statement 7 would be false (since 0 is not composite). This configuration does not satisfy all conditions.\n\nGiven the analysis, there is no consistent configuration of true and false statements that satisfies all the given conditions. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is zero.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<0>>>."
