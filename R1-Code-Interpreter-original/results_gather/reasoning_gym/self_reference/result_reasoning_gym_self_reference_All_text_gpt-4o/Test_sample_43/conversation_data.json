    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's go through each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements (T) is 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means the number of false statements (F) is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This implies all statements are false, which contradicts Statement 1. Therefore, Statement 3 must be false.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies there are 4 true statements.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - Since Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 must be true.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - Prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. However, since Statement 4 is true, there are exactly 4 true statements, which is not a prime number. Therefore, Statement 6 is false.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - Since there are 3 false statements (as per Statement 4), and 3 is not a composite number, Statement 7 is false.\n\nNow, let's summarize the analysis:\n- Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 4 is true.\n- Statement 6 is false.\n- Statement 7 is false.\n\nGiven that Statement 4 is true, there are exactly 4 true statements. We have identified that Statements 1, 2, and 4 are true, and Statements 3, 6, and 7 are false. We need to determine the truth value of Statement 5.\n\n- **Statement 5**: Since Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true, Statement 5 is true.\n\nThus, the true statements are 1, 2, 4, and 5, and the false statements are 3, 6, and 7. This satisfies all the conditions given in the problem.\n\nTherefore, there is exactly one possible solution that satisfies all the conditions.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<1>>>"
