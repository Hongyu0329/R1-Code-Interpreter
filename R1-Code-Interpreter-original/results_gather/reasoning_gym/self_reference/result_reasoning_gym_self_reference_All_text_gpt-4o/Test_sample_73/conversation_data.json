    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's go through each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1: 'At least 5 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - This implies that the number of true statements (T) is 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2: 'At most 6 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - This implies that the number of false statements (F) is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.\n   - Since there are 7 statements in total, T can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n3. **Statement 3: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - This implies T = 5.\n\n4. **Statement 4: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - This implies F = 2, which means T = 5.\n\n5. **Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'**\n   - This means one of the statements (3 or 4) is true, and the other is false.\n   - If Statement 3 is true, then T = 5, and Statement 4 must be false.\n   - If Statement 4 is true, then T = 5, and Statement 3 must be false.\n   - Therefore, T = 5.\n\n6. **Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'**\n   - Prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n   - Since T = 5 from the analysis above, this statement is true.\n\n7. **Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'**\n   - Composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6.\n   - Since T = 5, F = 2, which is not a composite number.\n   - Therefore, Statement 7 is false.\n\nNow, let's summarize the findings:\n- T = 5 satisfies Statement 1, Statement 3, Statement 4, and Statement 6.\n- Statement 5 is satisfied because either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n- Statement 7 is false, which is consistent with our findings.\n\nSince T = 5 is the only consistent solution that satisfies all the conditions, there is only one possible solution.\n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
