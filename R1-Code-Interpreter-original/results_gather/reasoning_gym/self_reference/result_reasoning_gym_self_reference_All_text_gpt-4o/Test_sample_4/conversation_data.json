    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's go through each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 1 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means that not all statements can be false. There must be at least one true statement.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies that there can be 0, 1, or 2 false statements, meaning there can be 5, 6, or 7 true statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then all statements are false, which contradicts Statement 1. Therefore, Statement 3 must be false.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then all statements are true. However, this contradicts Statement 3, which we have already determined to be false. Therefore, Statement 4 must also be false.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - Since both Statement 3 and Statement 4 are false, Statement 5 must also be false.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The possible numbers of true statements, given Statement 2, are 5, 6, or 7. Among these, 5 and 7 are prime numbers.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The possible numbers of false statements, given Statement 2, are 0, 1, or 2. Among these, 0 and 1 are not composite numbers, but 2 is a composite number.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1**: 5 true statements and 2 false statements.\n  - This satisfies Statement 2 (at most 2 false), Statement 6 (5 is prime), and Statement 7 (2 is composite).\n  - Statements 3, 4, and 5 are false, which is consistent with our earlier analysis.\n\n- **Scenario 2**: 6 true statements and 1 false statement.\n  - This satisfies Statement 2 (at most 2 false) but does not satisfy Statement 6 (6 is not prime) or Statement 7 (1 is not composite).\n\n- **Scenario 3**: 7 true statements and 0 false statements.\n  - This satisfies Statement 2 (at most 2 false) but does not satisfy Statement 6 (7 is prime, but Statement 4 would be true, contradicting our earlier analysis) or Statement 7 (0 is not composite).\n\nFrom the analysis, only Scenario 1 is consistent with all the statements. Therefore, there is only one possible solution.\n\nThe number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
