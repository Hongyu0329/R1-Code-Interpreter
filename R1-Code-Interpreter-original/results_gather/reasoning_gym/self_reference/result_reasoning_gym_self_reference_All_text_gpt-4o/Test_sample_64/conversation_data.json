    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement and determine the number of possible solutions where all statements are consistent with each other.\n\n1. **Statement 1: 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - This implies that all 7 statements are true.\n\n2. **Statement 2: 'At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - This implies that either 0 or 1 statement is false, meaning 6 or 7 statements are true.\n\n3. **Statement 3: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - This implies that 3 statements are true and 4 are false.\n\n4. **Statement 4: 'Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - This implies that all 7 statements are true.\n\n5. **Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'**\n   - This implies that either Statement 3 is true (3 true statements) or Statement 4 is true (7 true statements), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'**\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements are 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'**\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements are 4, 6, or 8.\n\nNow, let's analyze the consistency of these statements:\n\n- If Statement 1 is true, then all 7 statements are true. This contradicts Statement 3, which says exactly 3 are true, and Statement 5, which says either Statement 3 or 4 is true, but not both. Therefore, Statement 1 cannot be true.\n\n- If Statement 2 is true, then at most 1 statement is false, meaning 6 or 7 statements are true. This contradicts Statement 3, which says exactly 3 are true. Therefore, Statement 2 cannot be true.\n\n- If Statement 3 is true, then exactly 3 statements are true. This contradicts Statement 4, which says all 7 are true, and Statement 5, which says either Statement 3 or 4 is true, but not both. Therefore, Statement 3 cannot be true.\n\n- If Statement 4 is true, then all 7 statements are true. This contradicts Statement 3, which says exactly 3 are true, and Statement 5, which says either Statement 3 or 4 is true, but not both. Therefore, Statement 4 cannot be true.\n\n- If Statement 5 is true, then either Statement 3 or 4 is true, but not both. Since neither Statement 3 nor 4 can be true, Statement 5 cannot be true.\n\n- If Statement 6 is true, then the number of true statements is a prime number. The possible prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, or 7. However, 7 cannot be true because it contradicts the other statements. Therefore, Statement 6 cannot be true.\n\n- If Statement 7 is true, then the number of false statements is a composite number. The possible composite numbers are 4, 6, or 8. However, 8 cannot be true because there are only 7 statements. Therefore, Statement 7 cannot be true.\n\nSince none of the statements can be true without contradiction, the only consistent solution is that all statements are false.\n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
