    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's go through each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1: 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - This implies that all 7 statements are true.\n\n2. **Statement 2: 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - This means that 0, 1, or 2 statements can be false.\n\n3. **Statement 3: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - This implies that 2 statements are false.\n\n4. **Statement 4: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - This also implies that 5 statements are true.\n\n5. **Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'**\n   - This means that either Statement 3 is true or Statement 4 is true, but not both simultaneously.\n\n6. **Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'**\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (out of 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'**\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (out of 7) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the consistency of these statements:\n\n- If Statement 1 is true, then all 7 statements are true. However, this contradicts Statement 2, which allows for up to 2 false statements. Therefore, Statement 1 cannot be true.\n\n- If Statement 3 is true, then exactly 5 statements are true, and 2 are false. This is consistent with Statement 4, but Statement 5 states that only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true, not both. Therefore, Statement 3 cannot be true.\n\n- If Statement 4 is true, then exactly 2 statements are false, and 5 are true. This is consistent with Statement 3, but again, Statement 5 states that only one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 can be true, not both. Therefore, Statement 4 cannot be true.\n\n- If Statement 6 is true, the number of true statements must be a prime number. The possible prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n- If Statement 7 is true, the number of false statements must be a composite number. The possible composite numbers are 4 and 6.\n\nLet's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1: 5 true statements and 2 false statements**\n  - This satisfies Statement 2 (at most 2 false), Statement 6 (5 is prime), and Statement 7 (2 false means 5 true, which is not composite, so this scenario is not possible).\n\n- **Scenario 2: 3 true statements and 4 false statements**\n  - This satisfies Statement 2 (at most 2 false, so this scenario is not possible).\n\n- **Scenario 3: 2 true statements and 5 false statements**\n  - This satisfies Statement 2 (at most 2 false, so this scenario is not possible).\n\n- **Scenario 4: 7 true statements and 0 false statements**\n  - This satisfies Statement 1 (at least 7 true), but contradicts Statement 2 (at most 2 false), so this scenario is not possible.\n\n- **Scenario 5: 4 true statements and 3 false statements**\n  - This satisfies Statement 2 (at most 2 false, so this scenario is not possible).\n\n- **Scenario 6: 6 true statements and 1 false statement**\n  - This satisfies Statement 2 (at most 2 false, so this scenario is not possible).\n\nAfter analyzing all possible scenarios, we find that none of them satisfy all the conditions simultaneously. Therefore, there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
