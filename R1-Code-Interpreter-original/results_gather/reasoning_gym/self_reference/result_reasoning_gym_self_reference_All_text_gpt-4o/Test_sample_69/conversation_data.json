    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\n1. **Statement 1: 'At least 5 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - This implies that the number of true statements (T) is at least 5. So, T ≥ 5.\n\n2. **Statement 2: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - This implies that the number of false statements (F) is at most 3. So, F ≤ 3.\n   - Since there are 7 statements in total, T + F = 7. Therefore, T ≤ 4.\n   - Combining T ≥ 5 and T ≤ 4 leads to a contradiction, meaning Statement 2 cannot be true.\n\n3. **Statement 3: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - This implies T = 5.\n\n4. **Statement 4: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - This implies F = 5.\n   - Since T + F = 7, T = 2.\n\n5. **Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'**\n   - This is an exclusive OR condition. If Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 must be false, and vice versa.\n\n6. **Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'**\n   - Possible values for T that are prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'**\n   - Possible values for F that are composite numbers are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1: T = 5**\n  - If T = 5, then F = 2.\n  - Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 6 is true because 5 is a prime number.\n  - Statement 7 is false because 2 is not a composite number.\n  - Total true statements = 5, which satisfies Statement 1.\n  - This scenario is consistent.\n\n- **Scenario 2: T = 2**\n  - If T = 2, then F = 5.\n  - Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is true.\n  - Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true.\n  - Statement 6 is true because 2 is a prime number.\n  - Statement 7 is true because 5 is a composite number.\n  - Total true statements = 2, which does not satisfy Statement 1.\n  - This scenario is inconsistent.\n\n- **Scenario 3: T = 3**\n  - If T = 3, then F = 4.\n  - Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is false because neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true.\n  - Statement 6 is true because 3 is a prime number.\n  - Statement 7 is true because 4 is a composite number.\n  - Total true statements = 3, which does not satisfy Statement 1.\n  - This scenario is inconsistent.\n\n- **Scenario 4: T = 7**\n  - If T = 7, then F = 0.\n  - Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is false because neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true.\n  - Statement 6 is true because 7 is a prime number.\n  - Statement 7 is false because 0 is not a composite number.\n  - Total true statements = 7, which satisfies Statement 1.\n  - This scenario is consistent.\n\nFrom the analysis, the consistent scenarios are Scenario 1 (T = 5) and Scenario 4 (T = 7).\n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
