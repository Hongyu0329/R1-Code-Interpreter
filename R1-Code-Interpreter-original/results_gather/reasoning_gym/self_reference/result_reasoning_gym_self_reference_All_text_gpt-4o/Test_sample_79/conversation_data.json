    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's evaluate each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1: 'At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - If this statement is true, then there are either 6 or 7 true statements.\n\n2. **Statement 2: 'At most 1 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - If this statement is true, then there are either 0 or 1 false statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - If this statement is true, then there are exactly 2 true statements.\n\n4. **Statement 4: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - If this statement is true, then there are exactly 3 false statements.\n\n5. **Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'**\n   - This means that either Statement 3 is true or Statement 4 is true, but not both simultaneously.\n\n6. **Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'**\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (out of 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'**\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (out of 7) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1: 6 true statements, 1 false statement**\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is true.\n  - Statement 3 is false (since there are not exactly 2 true statements).\n  - Statement 4 is false (since there are not exactly 3 false statements).\n  - Statement 5 is false (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is true (since 6 is not a prime number, this scenario is invalid).\n  - Statement 7 is false (since 1 is not a composite number).\n\n- **Scenario 2: 7 true statements, 0 false statements**\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is true.\n  - Statement 3 is false (since there are not exactly 2 true statements).\n  - Statement 4 is false (since there are not exactly 3 false statements).\n  - Statement 5 is false (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is false (since 7 is a prime number, this scenario is invalid).\n  - Statement 7 is false (since 0 is not a composite number).\n\n- **Scenario 3: 5 true statements, 2 false statements**\n  - Statement 1 is false (since there are not at least 6 true statements).\n  - Statement 2 is false (since there are more than 1 false statement).\n  - Statement 3 is false (since there are not exactly 2 true statements).\n  - Statement 4 is false (since there are not exactly 3 false statements).\n  - Statement 5 is false (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is true (since 5 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (since 2 is not a composite number, this scenario is invalid).\n\n- **Scenario 4: 4 true statements, 3 false statements**\n  - Statement 1 is false (since there are not at least 6 true statements).\n  - Statement 2 is false (since there are more than 1 false statement).\n  - Statement 3 is false (since there are not exactly 2 true statements).\n  - Statement 4 is true (since there are exactly 3 false statements).\n  - Statement 5 is true (since Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false).\n  - Statement 6 is false (since 4 is not a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (since 3 is not a composite number, this scenario is invalid).\n\n- **Scenario 5: 3 true statements, 4 false statements**\n  - Statement 1 is false (since there are not at least 6 true statements).\n  - Statement 2 is false (since there are more than 1 false statement).\n  - Statement 3 is true (since there are exactly 2 true statements, this scenario is invalid).\n  - Statement 4 is false (since there are not exactly 3 false statements).\n  - Statement 5 is true (since Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false).\n  - Statement 6 is true (since 3 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (since 4 is a composite number).\n\n- **Scenario 6: 2 true statements, 5 false statements**\n  - Statement 1 is false (since there are not at least 6 true statements).\n  - Statement 2 is false (since there are more than 1 false statement).\n  - Statement 3 is true (since there are exactly 2 true statements).\n  - Statement 4 is false (since there are not exactly 3 false statements).\n  - Statement 5 is true (since Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false).\n  - Statement 6 is true (since 2 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is false (since 5 is not a composite number).\n\n- **Scenario 7: 1 true statement, 6 false statements**\n  - Statement 1 is false (since there are not at least 6 true statements).\n  - Statement 2 is false (since there are more than 1 false statement).\n  - Statement 3 is false (since there are not exactly 2 true statements).\n  - Statement 4 is false (since there are not exactly 3 false statements).\n  - Statement 5 is false (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is false (since 1 is not a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (since 6 is a composite number).\n\nAfter analyzing all scenarios, the only valid scenario is Scenario 5, where there are 3 true statements and 4 false statements. This satisfies all the conditions given in the statements.\n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
