    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement and determine the number of true and false statements that satisfy all conditions.\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This implies that the number of true statements, \\( T \\), is \\( T \\geq 2 \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 4 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This implies that the number of false statements, \\( F \\), is \\( F \\leq 4 \\).\n   - Since there are 7 statements in total, \\( T = 7 - F \\), so \\( T \\geq 3 \\).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This implies \\( T = 5 \\).\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This implies \\( F = 7 \\), which is impossible because it contradicts Statement 1 and Statement 2.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - Since Statement 4 cannot be true, Statement 3 must be true.\n   - Therefore, \\( T = 5 \\).\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - Since \\( T = 5 \\) and 5 is a prime number, this statement is true.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - If \\( T = 5 \\), then \\( F = 7 - 5 = 2 \\).\n   - 2 is not a composite number, so this statement is false.\n\nNow, let's verify the consistency of these findings:\n- \\( T = 5 \\) satisfies Statement 1, Statement 2, Statement 3, and Statement 6.\n- Statement 4 is false, which is consistent with Statement 5.\n- Statement 7 is false, which is consistent with our findings.\n\nThus, the only consistent solution is when \\( T = 5 \\) and \\( F = 2 \\).\n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
