    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 2 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This implies that the number of true statements (T) is at least 2.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This implies that the number of false statements (F) is at most 5, which means T â‰¥ 2.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This implies T = 0, which contradicts Statement 1. Therefore, Statement 3 must be false.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This implies F = 3, which means T = 4.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - Since Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 must be true. Therefore, T = 4.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - T = 4 is not a prime number, so Statement 6 is false.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - F = 3 is not a composite number, so Statement 7 is false.\n\nNow, let's verify the consistency of these conclusions:\n- If T = 4, then F = 3, which satisfies Statement 4.\n- Statement 1 is satisfied because T = 4 is at least 2.\n- Statement 2 is satisfied because F = 3 is at most 5.\n- Statement 3 is false, which is consistent with our earlier conclusion.\n- Statement 5 is satisfied because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 6 is false because 4 is not a prime number.\n- Statement 7 is false because 3 is not a composite number.\n\nThus, the only consistent solution is when T = 4 and F = 3. There is only one possible solution that satisfies all the conditions.\n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
