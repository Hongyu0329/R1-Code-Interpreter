    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements (T) is 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 7 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This is trivially true because there are only 7 statements, so at most 7 can be false.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means T = 2.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means the number of false statements (F) is 2, so T = 5.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either T = 2 or T = 5, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The prime numbers between 1 and 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The composite numbers between 1 and 7 are 4, 6, and 8.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **If T = 2**: \n  - Statement 3 is true, Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false).\n  - Statement 6 is true (2 is a prime number).\n  - F = 5, which is not a composite number (5 is prime), so Statement 7 is false.\n  - Total true statements = 3 (Statements 3, 5, and 6), which satisfies Statement 1.\n\n- **If T = 3**:\n  - Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is false (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is true (3 is a prime number).\n  - F = 4, which is a composite number, so Statement 7 is true.\n  - Total true statements = 3 (Statements 1, 6, and 7), which satisfies Statement 1.\n\n- **If T = 5**:\n  - Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 is true.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false).\n  - Statement 6 is true (5 is a prime number).\n  - F = 2, which is not a composite number (2 is prime), so Statement 7 is false.\n  - Total true statements = 4 (Statements 1, 4, 5, and 6), which satisfies Statement 1.\n\n- **If T = 7**:\n  - All statements are true, which contradicts Statement 3 and Statement 4.\n  - Therefore, T cannot be 7.\n\nFrom the analysis, the possible values of T that satisfy all conditions are 2, 3, and 5. Therefore, there are three possible solutions.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<3>>>."
