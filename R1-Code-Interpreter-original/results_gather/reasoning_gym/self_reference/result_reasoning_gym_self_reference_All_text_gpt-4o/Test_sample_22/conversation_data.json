    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's evaluate each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then all 7 statements must be true. However, this creates a contradiction because some statements claim a certain number of statements are false. Therefore, Statement 1 cannot be true.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then there can be 0, 1, or 2 false statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then 3 statements must be false.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then 2 statements must be true.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Therefore, either 4 statements are true, or 5 statements are false, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (out of 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (out of 7) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1**: Assume 2 statements are true (and 5 are false).\n  - This satisfies Statement 4.\n  - Statement 5 is satisfied because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 6 is not satisfied because 2 is a prime number.\n  - Statement 7 is satisfied because 5 is a composite number.\n  - This scenario is not possible because Statement 6 is not satisfied.\n\n- **Scenario 2**: Assume 3 statements are true (and 4 are false).\n  - This does not satisfy Statement 3 or Statement 4.\n  - Statement 5 is not satisfied because neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true.\n  - Statement 6 is satisfied because 3 is a prime number.\n  - Statement 7 is satisfied because 4 is a composite number.\n  - This scenario is not possible because Statement 5 is not satisfied.\n\n- **Scenario 3**: Assume 4 statements are true (and 3 are false).\n  - This satisfies Statement 3.\n  - Statement 5 is satisfied because Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 6 is not satisfied because 4 is not a prime number.\n  - Statement 7 is not satisfied because 3 is not a composite number.\n  - This scenario is not possible because Statements 6 and 7 are not satisfied.\n\n- **Scenario 4**: Assume 5 statements are true (and 2 are false).\n  - This does not satisfy Statement 3 or Statement 4.\n  - Statement 5 is not satisfied because neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true.\n  - Statement 6 is satisfied because 5 is a prime number.\n  - Statement 7 is not satisfied because 2 is not a composite number.\n  - This scenario is not possible because Statement 5 is not satisfied.\n\n- **Scenario 5**: Assume 6 statements are true (and 1 is false).\n  - This does not satisfy Statement 3 or Statement 4.\n  - Statement 5 is not satisfied because neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true.\n  - Statement 6 is not satisfied because 6 is not a prime number.\n  - Statement 7 is not satisfied because 1 is not a composite number.\n  - This scenario is not possible because Statements 5, 6, and 7 are not satisfied.\n\n- **Scenario 6**: Assume 7 statements are true (and 0 are false).\n  - This satisfies Statement 1.\n  - Statement 2 is satisfied because 0 is at most 2.\n  - Statement 3 is not satisfied because not exactly 4 are true.\n  - Statement 4 is not satisfied because not exactly 5 are false.\n  - Statement 5 is not satisfied because neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true.\n  - Statement 6 is not satisfied because 7 is a prime number.\n  - Statement 7 is not satisfied because 0 is not a composite number.\n  - This scenario is not possible because Statements 5, 6, and 7 are not satisfied.\n\nAfter analyzing all possible scenarios, we find that none of them satisfy all the conditions simultaneously. Therefore, there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0>>>"
