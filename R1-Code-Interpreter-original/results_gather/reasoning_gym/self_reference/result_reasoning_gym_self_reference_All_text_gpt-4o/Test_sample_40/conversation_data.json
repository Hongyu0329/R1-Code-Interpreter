    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's go through each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then there are either 6 or 7 true statements.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then there are 0, 1, or 2 false statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then there are exactly 2 true statements.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then there are exactly 5 true statements.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This statement implies that one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (out of 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (out of 7) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1**: Assume Statement 1 is true.\n  - This means there are at least 6 true statements.\n  - If there are 6 true statements, then 1 statement is false.\n  - If there are 7 true statements, then 0 statements are false.\n  - Statement 2 is true in both cases (0 or 1 false statements).\n  - Statement 3 cannot be true (since there are not exactly 2 true statements).\n  - Statement 4 cannot be true (since there are not exactly 2 false statements).\n  - Statement 5 is false (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is true if there are 7 true statements (7 is prime).\n  - Statement 7 is false if there are 0 false statements (0 is not composite).\n  - Therefore, having 7 true statements is consistent with Statement 1 being true.\n\n- **Scenario 2**: Assume Statement 1 is false.\n  - This means there are fewer than 6 true statements.\n  - Statement 2 must be true, so there are at most 2 false statements.\n  - If there are 5 true statements, then 2 statements are false.\n  - Statement 3 is false (since there are not exactly 2 true statements).\n  - Statement 4 is true (since there are exactly 2 false statements).\n  - Statement 5 is true (since Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false).\n  - Statement 6 is true (since 5 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (since 2 is not composite, but 5 true statements mean 2 false statements, which is not composite).\n  - Therefore, having 5 true statements is consistent with Statement 1 being false.\n\nFrom the analysis, we have two consistent scenarios:\n- 7 true statements (Scenario 1)\n- 5 true statements (Scenario 2)\n\nBoth scenarios satisfy the conditions of the problem, so there are two possible solutions.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<2>>>"
