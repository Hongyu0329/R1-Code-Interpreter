    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement and determine the number of true and false statements that satisfy all conditions.\n\n1. **Statement 1: 'At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - This implies that there are either 6 or 7 true statements.\n\n2. **Statement 2: 'At most 4 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - This implies that there are at most 4 false statements, meaning there are at least 3 true statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - This implies that there are exactly 5 true statements.\n\n4. **Statement 4: 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - This implies that all statements are false, which is a contradiction because if this statement is true, then it cannot be false.\n\n5. **Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'**\n   - This implies that either Statement 3 is true or Statement 4 is true, but not both. Since Statement 4 being true is a contradiction, Statement 3 must be true.\n\n6. **Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'**\n   - This implies that the number of true statements must be a prime number (2, 3, 5, 7).\n\n7. **Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'**\n   - This implies that the number of false statements must be a composite number (4, 6).\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- If Statement 3 is true, then there are exactly 5 true statements.\n- If there are 5 true statements, then there are 2 false statements.\n- 2 is not a composite number, so this scenario does not satisfy Statement 7.\n\nSince Statement 3 must be true (as Statement 4 cannot be true), and having 5 true statements does not satisfy Statement 7, we need to reconsider the implications:\n\n- If Statement 1 is true, then there are at least 6 true statements.\n- If there are 6 true statements, then there is 1 false statement.\n- 1 is not a composite number, so this scenario does not satisfy Statement 7.\n\n- If there are 7 true statements, then there are 0 false statements.\n- 0 is not a composite number, so this scenario does not satisfy Statement 7.\n\nGiven the constraints, the only possible scenario that satisfies all conditions is:\n\n- 5 true statements (Statement 3 is true).\n- 2 false statements (which does not satisfy Statement 7, but is the only consistent scenario given the constraints).\n\nThus, the number of possible solutions is 0, as no configuration satisfies all statements simultaneously.\n\n<<<0>>>"
