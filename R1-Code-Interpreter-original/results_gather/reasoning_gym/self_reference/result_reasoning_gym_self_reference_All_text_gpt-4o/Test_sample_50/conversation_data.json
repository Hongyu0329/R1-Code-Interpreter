    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement and determine the number of true and false statements that satisfy all conditions.\n\n1. **Statement 1: 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - This implies that all 7 statements are true.\n\n2. **Statement 2: 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - This means that there can be 0, 1, or 2 false statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3: 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - This implies that all statements are true, which is consistent with Statement 1.\n\n4. **Statement 4: 'Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - This contradicts Statement 1 and Statement 3, as it implies only 2 statements are true.\n\n5. **Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'**\n   - This means one of Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. If Statement 3 is true, then all statements are true. If Statement 4 is true, then 5 statements are false.\n\n6. **Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'**\n   - Possible prime numbers for the number of true statements are 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'**\n   - Possible composite numbers for the number of false statements are 4, 6, etc.\n\nNow, let's analyze the consistency:\n\n- If all 7 statements are true (as per Statement 1 and Statement 3), then:\n  - Statement 4 is false, which is consistent with Statement 5.\n  - The number of true statements is 7, which is a prime number, satisfying Statement 6.\n  - The number of false statements is 0, which is not a composite number, contradicting Statement 7.\n\n- If 5 statements are false (as per Statement 4), then:\n  - Statement 3 is false, which is consistent with Statement 5.\n  - The number of true statements is 2, which is a prime number, satisfying Statement 6.\n  - The number of false statements is 5, which is not a composite number, contradicting Statement 7.\n\n- If 6 statements are true, then:\n  - Statement 1 is false, contradicting itself.\n  - Statement 2 is true, as only 1 statement is false.\n  - Statement 3 is false, as not all 7 are true.\n  - Statement 4 is false, as not 5 are false.\n  - Statement 5 is false, as neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true.\n  - The number of true statements is 6, which is not a prime number, contradicting Statement 6.\n  - The number of false statements is 1, which is not a composite number, contradicting Statement 7.\n\n- If 5 statements are true, then:\n  - Statement 1 is false, contradicting itself.\n  - Statement 2 is true, as 2 statements are false.\n  - Statement 3 is false, as not all 7 are true.\n  - Statement 4 is false, as not 5 are false.\n  - Statement 5 is false, as neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true.\n  - The number of true statements is 5, which is a prime number, satisfying Statement 6.\n  - The number of false statements is 2, which is not a composite number, contradicting Statement 7.\n\n- If 4 statements are true, then:\n  - Statement 1 is false, contradicting itself.\n  - Statement 2 is true, as 3 statements are false.\n  - Statement 3 is false, as not all 7 are true.\n  - Statement 4 is false, as not 5 are false.\n  - Statement 5 is false, as neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true.\n  - The number of true statements is 4, which is not a prime number, contradicting Statement 6.\n  - The number of false statements is 3, which is not a composite number, contradicting Statement 7.\n\n- If 3 statements are true, then:\n  - Statement 1 is false, contradicting itself.\n  - Statement 2 is true, as 4 statements are false.\n  - Statement 3 is false, as not all 7 are true.\n  - Statement 4 is false, as not 5 are false.\n  - Statement 5 is false, as neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true.\n  - The number of true statements is 3, which is a prime number, satisfying Statement 6.\n  - The number of false statements is 4, which is a composite number, satisfying Statement 7.\n\nThus, the only consistent solution is when 3 statements are true and 4 are false. This satisfies all conditions without contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
