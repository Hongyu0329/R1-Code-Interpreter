    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\n1. **Statement 1: 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - This implies that all 7 statements are true.\n\n2. **Statement 2: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - This means that the number of false statements can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.\n\n3. **Statement 3: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - This means that 4 statements are true and 3 are false.\n\n4. **Statement 4: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - This means that 3 statements are false and 4 are true.\n\n5. **Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'**\n   - This is an exclusive OR condition, meaning either Statement 3 is true or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'**\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (out of 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'**\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (out of 7) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **If all 7 statements are true (Statement 1):**\n  - This contradicts Statement 5, as both Statements 3 and 4 cannot be true simultaneously.\n  - Also, if all are true, the number of false statements is 0, which is not a composite number, contradicting Statement 7.\n  - Therefore, not all 7 statements can be true.\n\n- **If 6 statements are true:**\n  - This would mean 1 statement is false, which is not a composite number, contradicting Statement 7.\n  - Therefore, 6 statements cannot be true.\n\n- **If 5 statements are true:**\n  - This means 2 statements are false, which is not a composite number, contradicting Statement 7.\n  - Therefore, 5 statements cannot be true.\n\n- **If 4 statements are true:**\n  - This satisfies Statement 3.\n  - This means 3 statements are false, which is a composite number, satisfying Statement 7.\n  - Statement 4 is also true, but Statement 5 requires that only one of Statements 3 or 4 is true, not both.\n  - Therefore, 4 statements cannot be true.\n\n- **If 3 statements are true:**\n  - This satisfies Statement 4.\n  - This means 4 statements are false, which is a composite number, satisfying Statement 7.\n  - Statement 3 is false, which satisfies Statement 5 (only one of Statements 3 or 4 is true).\n  - The number of true statements (3) is a prime number, satisfying Statement 6.\n  - This scenario satisfies all conditions.\n\n- **If 2 statements are true:**\n  - This means 5 statements are false, which is not a composite number, contradicting Statement 7.\n  - Therefore, 2 statements cannot be true.\n\n- **If 1 statement is true:**\n  - This means 6 statements are false, which is a composite number, satisfying Statement 7.\n  - However, the number of true statements (1) is not a prime number, contradicting Statement 6.\n  - Therefore, 1 statement cannot be true.\n\n- **If 0 statements are true:**\n  - This means 7 statements are false, which is not a composite number, contradicting Statement 7.\n  - Therefore, 0 statements cannot be true.\n\nAfter analyzing all possible scenarios, the only consistent solution is when 3 statements are true.\n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
