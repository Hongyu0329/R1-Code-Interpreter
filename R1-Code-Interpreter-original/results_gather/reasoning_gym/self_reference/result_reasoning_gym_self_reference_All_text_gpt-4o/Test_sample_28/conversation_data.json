    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's go through each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1: 'At least 5 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - This implies that the number of true statements (T) is 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2: 'At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - This implies that the number of false statements (F) is 0, 1, or 2. Therefore, T can be 5, 6, or 7.\n\n3. **Statement 3: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - This implies T = 3.\n\n4. **Statement 4: 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - This implies F = 1, so T = 6.\n\n5. **Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'**\n   - This means either T = 3 (Statement 3 is true) or T = 6 (Statement 4 is true), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'**\n   - The prime numbers between 1 and 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. So, T can be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'**\n   - The composite numbers between 0 and 7 are 4 and 6. So, F can be 4 or 6, which means T can be 3 or 1.\n\nNow, let's analyze the compatibility of these statements:\n\n- From Statements 1 and 2, T can be 5, 6, or 7.\n- From Statement 3, T = 3.\n- From Statement 4, T = 6.\n- From Statement 5, T can be 3 or 6, but not both.\n- From Statement 6, T can be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n- From Statement 7, T can be 3 or 1.\n\nCombining all these conditions, we find:\n\n- T = 3 is possible because it satisfies Statements 3, 5, 6, and 7.\n- T = 6 is possible because it satisfies Statements 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n\nTherefore, there are two possible solutions: T = 3 and T = 6.\n\nThus, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
