    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This implies that the number of true statements (T) is 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies that the number of false statements (F) is 0, 1, 2, or 3.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This implies T = 3.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies F = 2.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This implies that either T = 3 or F = 2, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - Possible values for T that are prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - Possible values for F that are composite numbers are 4, 6, and 8. However, since we have only 7 statements, F can only be 4.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1**: T = 4, F = 3\n  - Satisfies Statement 1 (at least 4 true).\n  - Satisfies Statement 2 (at most 3 false).\n  - Does not satisfy Statement 3 (exactly 3 true).\n  - Does not satisfy Statement 4 (exactly 2 false).\n  - Satisfies Statement 5 (neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Does not satisfy Statement 6 (4 is not a prime number).\n  - Does not satisfy Statement 7 (3 is not a composite number).\n\n- **Scenario 2**: T = 5, F = 2\n  - Satisfies Statement 1 (at least 4 true).\n  - Satisfies Statement 2 (at most 3 false).\n  - Does not satisfy Statement 3 (exactly 3 true).\n  - Satisfies Statement 4 (exactly 2 false).\n  - Satisfies Statement 5 (Statement 4 is true, Statement 3 is not).\n  - Satisfies Statement 6 (5 is a prime number).\n  - Does not satisfy Statement 7 (2 is not a composite number).\n\n- **Scenario 3**: T = 6, F = 1\n  - Satisfies Statement 1 (at least 4 true).\n  - Satisfies Statement 2 (at most 3 false).\n  - Does not satisfy Statement 3 (exactly 3 true).\n  - Does not satisfy Statement 4 (exactly 2 false).\n  - Satisfies Statement 5 (neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Does not satisfy Statement 6 (6 is not a prime number).\n  - Does not satisfy Statement 7 (1 is not a composite number).\n\n- **Scenario 4**: T = 7, F = 0\n  - Satisfies Statement 1 (at least 4 true).\n  - Does not satisfy Statement 2 (at most 3 false).\n  - Does not satisfy Statement 3 (exactly 3 true).\n  - Does not satisfy Statement 4 (exactly 2 false).\n  - Satisfies Statement 5 (neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Satisfies Statement 6 (7 is a prime number).\n  - Does not satisfy Statement 7 (0 is not a composite number).\n\nFrom the analysis, only Scenario 2 satisfies all the conditions that can be satisfied simultaneously. Therefore, there is only one possible solution.\n\nThe number of possible solutions is:\n<<<1>>>"
