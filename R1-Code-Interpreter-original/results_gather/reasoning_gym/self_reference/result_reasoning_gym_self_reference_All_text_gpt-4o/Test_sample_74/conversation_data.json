    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\n1. **Statement 1: 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - This implies that the number of true statements (T) is 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - This implies that the number of false statements (F) is 0, 1, 2, or 3.\n   - Since there are 7 statements in total, T = 7 - F, so T can be 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n3. **Statement 3: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - This implies T = 4.\n\n4. **Statement 4: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - This implies F = 3, which means T = 4.\n\n5. **Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'**\n   - This means either T = 4 (Statement 3 is true) or F = 3 (Statement 4 is true), but not both simultaneously.\n   - Since both conditions imply T = 4, this statement is always true if T = 4.\n\n6. **Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'**\n   - The prime numbers between 1 and 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n   - Since T must be 4 (from Statements 3 and 4), this statement is false.\n\n7. **Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'**\n   - The composite numbers between 1 and 7 are 4, 6, and 8.\n   - Since F = 3 (from Statement 4), this statement is false.\n\nNow, let's analyze the consistency of these statements:\n\n- If T = 4, then:\n  - Statement 1 is true (since at least 4 are true).\n  - Statement 2 is true (since at most 3 are false).\n  - Statement 3 is true (since exactly 4 are true).\n  - Statement 4 is true (since exactly 3 are false).\n  - Statement 5 is false (since both Statements 3 and 4 are true, contradicting the \"but not both\" part).\n  - Statement 6 is false (since 4 is not a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is false (since 3 is not a composite number).\n\n- If T = 5, 6, or 7, then:\n  - Statement 3 is false (since exactly 4 are not true).\n  - Statement 4 is false (since exactly 3 are not false).\n  - Statement 5 is true (since neither Statement 3 nor 4 is true, satisfying the \"but not both\" condition).\n  - Statement 6 is true for T = 5 or 7 (since both are prime numbers).\n  - Statement 7 is false for T = 5 or 7 (since F = 2 or 0, neither of which is composite).\n\nGiven these analyses, the only consistent solution is when T = 5, which satisfies all the conditions:\n\n- Statement 1 is true.\n- Statement 2 is true.\n- Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 4 is false.\n- Statement 5 is true.\n- Statement 6 is true.\n- Statement 7 is false.\n\nThus, there is only one possible solution where T = 5.\n\nThe number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
