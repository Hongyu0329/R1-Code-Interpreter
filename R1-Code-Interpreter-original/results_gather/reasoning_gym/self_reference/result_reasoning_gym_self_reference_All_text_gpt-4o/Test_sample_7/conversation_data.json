    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's evaluate each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 6 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then there are either 6 or 7 true statements.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 0 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then all statements are true (0 false statements).\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then there are exactly 2 true statements.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then there are 6 true statements.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This statement implies that either Statement 3 is true or Statement 4 is true, but not both simultaneously.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (out of 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (out of 7) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the consistency of these statements:\n\n- If Statement 1 is true, then there are at least 6 true statements. This means either 6 or 7 statements are true.\n- If Statement 2 is true, then all statements are true (7 true statements).\n- If Statement 3 is true, then there are exactly 2 true statements, which contradicts Statement 1.\n- If Statement 4 is true, then there are exactly 6 true statements.\n- Statement 5 requires that either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both. If Statement 3 is true, then there are 2 true statements, which contradicts Statement 1. If Statement 4 is true, then there are 6 true statements.\n- Statement 6 requires the number of true statements to be a prime number. The possible prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n- Statement 7 requires the number of false statements to be a composite number. The possible composite numbers are 4 and 6.\n\nLet's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n- **Scenario 1**: 7 true statements\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is true.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is false (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is true (7 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is false (0 false statements is not a composite number).\n\n- **Scenario 2**: 6 true statements\n  - Statement 1 is true.\n  - Statement 2 is false.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is true.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false).\n  - Statement 6 is true (6 is not a prime number, so this scenario is invalid).\n\n- **Scenario 3**: 5 true statements\n  - Statement 1 is false.\n  - Statement 2 is false.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is false.\n  - Statement 6 is true (5 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (2 false statements is not a composite number, so this scenario is invalid).\n\n- **Scenario 4**: 4 true statements\n  - Statement 1 is false.\n  - Statement 2 is false.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is false.\n  - Statement 6 is false (4 is not a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (3 false statements is not a composite number, so this scenario is invalid).\n\n- **Scenario 5**: 3 true statements\n  - Statement 1 is false.\n  - Statement 2 is false.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is false.\n  - Statement 6 is true (3 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (4 false statements is a composite number).\n\n- **Scenario 6**: 2 true statements\n  - Statement 1 is false.\n  - Statement 2 is false.\n  - Statement 3 is true.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false).\n  - Statement 6 is true (2 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is false (5 false statements is not a composite number).\n\n- **Scenario 7**: 1 true statement\n  - Statement 1 is false.\n  - Statement 2 is false.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is false.\n  - Statement 6 is false (1 is not a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (6 false statements is a composite number).\n\nFrom the analysis, the valid scenarios are Scenario 1 and Scenario 5. Therefore, there are two possible solutions.\n\nThe number of possible solutions is: <<<2>>>."
