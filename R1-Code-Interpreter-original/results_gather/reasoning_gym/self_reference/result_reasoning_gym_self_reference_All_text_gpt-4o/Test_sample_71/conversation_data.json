    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\n1. **Statement 1: 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - This implies that the number of true statements (T) is 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2: 'At most 4 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - This implies that the number of false statements (F) is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n3. **Statement 3: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - This implies T = 4.\n\n4. **Statement 4: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - This implies F = 3, which means T = 4.\n\n5. **Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'**\n   - This implies that either T = 4 (Statement 3 is true) or F = 3 (Statement 4 is true), but not both. Since both imply T = 4, this statement is inherently contradictory if both are true simultaneously.\n\n6. **Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'**\n   - The prime numbers between 0 and 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. Therefore, T could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'**\n   - The composite numbers between 0 and 7 are 4, 6, and 8. Therefore, F could be 4, 6, or 8.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values for T and F:\n\n- From Statement 1, T = 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n- From Statement 2, F = 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n- From Statement 6, T = 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n- From Statement 7, F = 4, 6, or 8.\n\nSince T + F = 7, we can check the possible combinations:\n\n- **T = 4, F = 3:** \n  - Satisfies Statement 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n  - Statement 5 is false because both Statement 3 and 4 are true.\n  - Statement 6 is false because 4 is not a prime number.\n  - Statement 7 is false because 3 is not a composite number.\n  - This combination does not satisfy all conditions.\n\n- **T = 5, F = 2:**\n  - Satisfies Statement 1 and 2.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is true because neither Statement 3 nor 4 is true.\n  - Statement 6 is true because 5 is a prime number.\n  - Statement 7 is false because 2 is not a composite number.\n  - This combination does not satisfy all conditions.\n\n- **T = 6, F = 1:**\n  - Satisfies Statement 1 and 2.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is true because neither Statement 3 nor 4 is true.\n  - Statement 6 is false because 6 is not a prime number.\n  - Statement 7 is false because 1 is not a composite number.\n  - This combination does not satisfy all conditions.\n\n- **T = 7, F = 0:**\n  - Satisfies Statement 1 and 2.\n  - Statement 3 is false.\n  - Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is true because neither Statement 3 nor 4 is true.\n  - Statement 6 is false because 7 is a prime number.\n  - Statement 7 is false because 0 is not a composite number.\n  - This combination does not satisfy all conditions.\n\nAfter analyzing all possible combinations, we find that none of them satisfy all the conditions simultaneously. Therefore, there are no possible solutions that satisfy all the given statements.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0>>>"
