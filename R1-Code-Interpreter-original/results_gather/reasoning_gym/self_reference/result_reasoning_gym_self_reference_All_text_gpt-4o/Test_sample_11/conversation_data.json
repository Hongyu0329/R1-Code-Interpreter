    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement and determine the number of true and false statements that satisfy all conditions.\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This implies that the number of true statements (T) is at least 4.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This implies that the number of false statements (F) is at most 5.\n   - Since there are 7 statements in total, T + F = 7. Therefore, T â‰¤ 2.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This implies T = 7. If this statement is true, then all statements are true, which contradicts other statements. Therefore, Statement 3 must be false.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 1 of these 7 statements is false.'\n   - This implies F = 1. If this statement is true, then all other statements except one are true.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - Since Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 must be true.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - Possible prime numbers for T are 2, 3, 5, and 7. Since T = 6 (from Statement 4 being true), this statement is false.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - Possible composite numbers for F are 4, 6, 8, etc. Since F = 1 (from Statement 4 being true), this statement is false.\n\nNow, let's verify the consistency of these statements:\n- From Statement 4 being true, F = 1 and T = 6.\n- Statement 1 is true because T = 6, which is at least 4.\n- Statement 2 is true because F = 1, which is at most 5.\n- Statement 3 is false as determined earlier.\n- Statement 5 is true because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 6 is false because 6 is not a prime number.\n- Statement 7 is false because 1 is not a composite number.\n\nThus, the only consistent solution is when T = 6 and F = 1.\n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
