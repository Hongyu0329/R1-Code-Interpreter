    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine how many of them can be true simultaneously. Let's evaluate each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then all 7 statements must be true. However, if all statements are true, Statement 3 (\"Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are true\") would be false, creating a contradiction. Therefore, Statement 1 cannot be true.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then at most 2 statements can be false, meaning at least 5 statements are true.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then only one statement can be true, which would contradict Statement 1 and Statement 2 if they were true. Therefore, Statement 3 cannot be true.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 5 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - If this statement is true, then exactly 2 statements are true.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - Since Statement 3 cannot be true, Statement 4 must be true for Statement 5 to be true.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - If Statement 4 is true, then there are exactly 2 true statements, which is a prime number. Therefore, Statement 6 can be true.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - If Statement 4 is true, then there are exactly 5 false statements, which is a composite number. Therefore, Statement 7 can be true.\n\nNow, let's determine the possible solutions:\n\n- If Statement 4 is true, then there are exactly 2 true statements.\n- Statement 5 is true because Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false.\n- Statement 6 is true because 2 is a prime number.\n- Statement 7 is true because 5 is a composite number.\n\nThus, the true statements are Statement 4, Statement 5, Statement 6, and Statement 7. This configuration satisfies all conditions without contradictions.\n\nTherefore, there is only one possible solution where exactly 2 statements are true.\n\nThe number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
