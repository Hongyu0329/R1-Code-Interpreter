    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all conditions. Let's evaluate each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This implies that the number of true statements (T) is 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies that the number of false statements (F) is 0, 1, or 2. Since there are 7 statements in total, T can be 5, 6, or 7.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 1 of these 7 statements is true.\"\n   - This implies T = 1.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies T = 0.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This implies that either T = 1 (Statement 3 is true) or T = 0 (Statement 4 is true), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The possible prime numbers for T (given the total of 7 statements) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The possible composite numbers for F (given the total of 7 statements) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the compatibility of these statements:\n\n- If T = 0 (Statement 4 is true), then F = 7, which is not a composite number. So, T cannot be 0.\n- If T = 1 (Statement 3 is true), then F = 6, which is a composite number. This satisfies Statement 7. However, Statement 1 and Statement 2 would be false, contradicting the condition that at least 4 statements are true.\n- If T = 2, then F = 5, which is not a composite number. So, T cannot be 2.\n- If T = 3, then F = 4, which is a composite number. However, this contradicts Statement 1, which requires at least 4 true statements.\n- If T = 4, then F = 3, which is not a composite number. So, T cannot be 4.\n- If T = 5, then F = 2, which is not a composite number. So, T cannot be 5.\n- If T = 6, then F = 1, which is not a composite number. So, T cannot be 6.\n- If T = 7, then F = 0, which is not a composite number. So, T cannot be 7.\n\nAfter analyzing all possibilities, we find that there is no consistent solution that satisfies all the given statements. Therefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
