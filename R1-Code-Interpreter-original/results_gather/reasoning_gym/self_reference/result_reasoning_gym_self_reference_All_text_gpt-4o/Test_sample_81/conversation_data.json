    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\n1. **Statement 1: 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - This implies that all 7 statements are true.\n\n2. **Statement 2: 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - This means that there can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 false statements.\n\n3. **Statement 3: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - This implies that 4 statements are false.\n\n4. **Statement 4: 'Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - This implies that all 7 statements are true.\n\n5. **Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'**\n   - This is a logical XOR condition. If Statement 3 is true, then Statement 4 must be false, and vice versa.\n\n6. **Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'**\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (from 0 to 7) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'**\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (from 0 to 7) are 4, 6, and 8.\n\nNow, let's analyze the consistency of these statements:\n\n- If Statement 1 is true, then all 7 statements are true. This contradicts Statement 3, which says exactly 3 are true, and Statement 5, which requires either Statement 3 or 4 to be true, but not both. Therefore, Statement 1 cannot be true.\n\n- If Statement 4 is true, then all 7 statements are true. This again contradicts Statement 3 and Statement 5. Therefore, Statement 4 cannot be true.\n\n- If Statement 3 is true, then exactly 3 statements are true. This means 4 statements are false. This satisfies Statement 2 (at most 5 false) and Statement 5 (since Statement 4 is false). However, Statement 6 requires the number of true statements to be a prime number, and 3 is a prime number. Statement 7 requires the number of false statements to be a composite number, and 4 is a composite number. Therefore, this configuration is consistent.\n\n- If Statement 6 is true, the number of true statements must be a prime number. We have already found that having 3 true statements is consistent.\n\n- If Statement 7 is true, the number of false statements must be a composite number. We have already found that having 4 false statements is consistent.\n\nThus, the only consistent solution is having exactly 3 true statements and 4 false statements. This satisfies all the conditions given by the statements.\n\nTherefore, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
