    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement and determine the number of possible solutions where these statements can be true. Let's go through each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements (T) is 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 0 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means all statements are true, so T = 7.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means T = 7.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means T = 4.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either T = 7 or T = 4, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The prime numbers between 1 and 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. So T could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The composite numbers between 0 and 6 are 4 and 6. So the number of false statements (F) could be 4 or 6, which means T could be 3 or 1.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values of T:\n\n- **T = 7**: \n  - Statement 1 is true (since 7 ≥ 4).\n  - Statement 2 is true (since 0 false statements).\n  - Statement 3 is true (since all 7 are true).\n  - Statement 4 is false (since 0 false statements).\n  - Statement 5 is false (since both Statement 3 and Statement 4 cannot be true).\n  - Statement 6 is true (since 7 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is false (since 0 false statements, and 0 is not composite).\n\n  Here, Statements 1, 2, 3, and 6 are true, which satisfies Statement 1 (at least 4 true). However, Statement 5 is false, which contradicts the condition that either Statement 3 or 4 is true, but not both. Therefore, T = 7 is not a valid solution.\n\n- **T = 4**:\n  - Statement 1 is true (since 4 ≥ 4).\n  - Statement 2 is false (since 3 false statements).\n  - Statement 3 is false (since not all 7 are true).\n  - Statement 4 is true (since 3 false statements).\n  - Statement 5 is true (since Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false).\n  - Statement 6 is false (since 4 is not a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (since 3 false statements, and 3 is not composite).\n\n  Here, Statements 1, 4, 5, and 7 are true, which satisfies Statement 1 (at least 4 true). This is a valid solution.\n\n- **T = 5**:\n  - Statement 1 is true (since 5 ≥ 4).\n  - Statement 2 is false (since 2 false statements).\n  - Statement 3 is false (since not all 7 are true).\n  - Statement 4 is false (since 2 false statements).\n  - Statement 5 is false (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is true (since 5 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is false (since 2 false statements, and 2 is not composite).\n\n  Here, Statements 1 and 6 are true, which does not satisfy Statement 1 (at least 4 true). Therefore, T = 5 is not a valid solution.\n\n- **T = 6**:\n  - Statement 1 is true (since 6 ≥ 4).\n  - Statement 2 is false (since 1 false statement).\n  - Statement 3 is false (since not all 7 are true).\n  - Statement 4 is false (since 1 false statement).\n  - Statement 5 is false (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is false (since 6 is not a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is false (since 1 false statement, and 1 is not composite).\n\n  Here, only Statement 1 is true, which does not satisfy Statement 1 (at least 4 true). Therefore, T = 6 is not a valid solution.\n\n- **T = 3**:\n  - Statement 1 is false (since 3 < 4).\n  - Statement 2 is false (since 4 false statements).\n  - Statement 3 is false (since not all 7 are true).\n  - Statement 4 is false (since 4 false statements).\n  - Statement 5 is false (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is true (since 3 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (since 4 false statements, and 4 is composite).\n\n  Here, Statements 6 and 7 are true, which does not satisfy Statement 1 (at least 4 true). Therefore, T = 3 is not a valid solution.\n\n- **T = 2**:\n  - Statement 1 is false (since 2 < 4).\n  - Statement 2 is false (since 5 false statements).\n  - Statement 3 is false (since not all 7 are true).\n  - Statement 4 is false (since 5 false statements).\n  - Statement 5 is false (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is true (since 2 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is false (since 5 false statements, and 5 is not composite).\n\n  Here, only Statement 6 is true, which does not satisfy Statement 1 (at least 4 true). Therefore, T = 2 is not a valid solution.\n\n- **T = 1**:\n  - Statement 1 is false (since 1 < 4).\n  - Statement 2 is false (since 6 false statements).\n  - Statement 3 is false (since not all 7 are true).\n  - Statement 4 is false (since 6 false statements).\n  - Statement 5 is false (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is false (since 1 is not a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is false (since 6 false statements, and 6 is composite).\n\n  Here, no statements are true, which does not satisfy Statement 1 (at least 4 true). Therefore, T = 1 is not a valid solution.\n\nAfter analyzing all possible values of T, the only valid solution is when T = 4. Therefore, there is only one possible solution.\n\nThe number of possible solutions is: <<<1>>>."
