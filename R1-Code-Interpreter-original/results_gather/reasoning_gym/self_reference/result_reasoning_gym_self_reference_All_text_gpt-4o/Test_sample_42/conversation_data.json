    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\n1. **Statement 1**: 'At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means the number of true statements (T) is 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: 'At most 3 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means the number of false statements (F) is 0, 1, 2, or 3.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: 'Exactly 7 of these 7 statements are true.'\n   - This means all statements are true, so T = 7 and F = 0.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: 'Exactly 2 of these 7 statements are false.'\n   - This means T = 5 and F = 2.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'\n   - This means either T = 7 (Statement 3 is true) or T = 5 (Statement 4 is true), but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'\n   - The prime numbers between 0 and 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'\n   - The composite numbers between 0 and 7 are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible scenarios:\n\n- **If T = 7**: \n  - Statement 3 is true, and Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false).\n  - Statement 6 is true (7 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is false (0 is not a composite number).\n  - This scenario satisfies Statement 1 and Statement 2.\n  - Total true statements = 5 (Statements 1, 2, 3, 5, 6), which is not 7, so this scenario is not possible.\n\n- **If T = 5**:\n  - Statement 3 is false, and Statement 4 is true.\n  - Statement 5 is true (since Statement 4 is true and Statement 3 is false).\n  - Statement 6 is true (5 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (2 is not a composite number, but 2 false statements mean 5 true statements, which is prime).\n  - This scenario satisfies Statement 1 and Statement 2.\n  - Total true statements = 5 (Statements 1, 2, 4, 5, 6), which is 5, so this scenario is possible.\n\n- **If T = 3**:\n  - Statement 3 is false, and Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is false (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is true (3 is a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is true (4 is a composite number).\n  - This scenario satisfies Statement 1 and Statement 2.\n  - Total true statements = 3 (Statements 1, 2, 6), which is 3, so this scenario is possible.\n\n- **If T = 4**:\n  - Statement 3 is false, and Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is false (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is false (4 is not a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is false (3 is not a composite number).\n  - This scenario does not satisfy Statement 1 and Statement 2.\n  - Total true statements = 2 (Statements 1, 2), which is not 4, so this scenario is not possible.\n\n- **If T = 6**:\n  - Statement 3 is false, and Statement 4 is false.\n  - Statement 5 is false (since neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 is true).\n  - Statement 6 is false (6 is not a prime number).\n  - Statement 7 is false (1 is not a composite number).\n  - This scenario does not satisfy Statement 1 and Statement 2.\n  - Total true statements = 2 (Statements 1, 2), which is not 6, so this scenario is not possible.\n\nThus, the possible scenarios are when T = 5 and T = 3. Therefore, there are two possible solutions.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<2>>>."
