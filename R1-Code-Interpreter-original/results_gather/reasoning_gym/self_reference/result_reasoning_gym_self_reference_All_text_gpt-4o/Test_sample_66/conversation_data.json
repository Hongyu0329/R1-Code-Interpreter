    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's go through each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This implies that the number of true statements (T) is 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies that the number of false statements (F) is 0, 1, or 2. Since there are 7 statements in total, T can be 5, 6, or 7.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This implies T = 4.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies T = 7.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either T = 4 or T = 7, but not both.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The prime numbers between 1 and 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. So, T can be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The composite numbers between 0 and 7 are 4, 6, and 8. Since F = 7 - T, F can be 4, 6, or 8.\n\nNow, let's combine these conditions:\n\n- From Statements 1 and 2, T can be 5, 6, or 7.\n- From Statement 5, T can be 4 or 7, but not both.\n- From Statement 6, T can be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n- From Statement 7, F can be 4, 6, or 8, which means T can be 3, 1, or -1 (impossible).\n\nCombining all these conditions, we find:\n\n- T = 5: Satisfies Statements 1, 2, and 6, but not 5 or 7.\n- T = 6: Satisfies Statements 1, 2, but not 5, 6, or 7.\n- T = 7: Satisfies Statements 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6, but not 7.\n\nThe only value of T that satisfies all the conditions is T = 7. Therefore, there is only one possible solution.\n\n<<<1>>>"
