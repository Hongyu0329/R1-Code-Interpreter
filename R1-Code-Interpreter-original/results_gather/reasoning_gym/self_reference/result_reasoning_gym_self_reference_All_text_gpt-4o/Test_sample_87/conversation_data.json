    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\n1. **Statement 1: 'At least 7 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - This implies that all 7 statements are true. If this statement is true, then all statements must be true.\n\n2. **Statement 2: 'At most 4 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - This means that there can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 false statements. If this statement is true, then the number of true statements can be 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n3. **Statement 3: 'Exactly 0 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - If this statement is true, then it creates a contradiction because it would mean that at least one statement (Statement 3 itself) is true. Therefore, Statement 3 must be false.\n\n4. **Statement 4: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - If this statement is true, then there are exactly 3 false statements and 4 true statements.\n\n5. **Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'**\n   - Since Statement 3 is false, Statement 4 must be true for Statement 5 to be true.\n\n6. **Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'**\n   - The possible prime numbers for the number of true statements (given 7 statements in total) are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'**\n   - The possible composite numbers for the number of false statements (given 7 statements in total) are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the consistency of these statements:\n\n- From Statement 4, we know there are exactly 3 false statements, which means there are 4 true statements.\n- Statement 6 requires the number of true statements to be a prime number. 4 is not a prime number, so Statement 6 must be false.\n- Statement 7 requires the number of false statements to be a composite number. 3 is not a composite number, so Statement 7 must be false.\n\nGiven that Statement 4 is true, and Statements 6 and 7 are false, we have:\n\n- True statements: 1 (Statement 4), 2 (Statement 5)\n- False statements: 3 (Statement 1), 4 (Statement 2), 5 (Statement 3), 6 (Statement 6), 7 (Statement 7)\n\nThis configuration satisfies all the conditions:\n\n- Statement 1 is false because not all 7 statements are true.\n- Statement 2 is false because there are more than 4 false statements.\n- Statement 3 is false as analyzed.\n- Statement 4 is true as analyzed.\n- Statement 5 is true because Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true.\n- Statement 6 is false because 4 is not a prime number.\n- Statement 7 is false because 3 is not a composite number.\n\nThus, there is only one consistent solution where Statements 4 and 5 are true, and the rest are false.\n\nThe number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
