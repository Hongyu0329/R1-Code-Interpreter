    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions.\n\n1. **Statement 1: 'At least 4 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - This implies that the number of true statements (T) is at least 4.\n\n2. **Statement 2: 'At most 5 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - This implies that the number of false statements (F) is at most 5.\n   - Since there are 7 statements in total, T + F = 7.\n   - Therefore, T must be at least 2 (since F â‰¤ 5).\n\n3. **Statement 3: 'Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.'**\n   - This implies T = 4.\n\n4. **Statement 4: 'Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.'**\n   - This implies F = 3, which means T = 4.\n\n5. **Statement 5: 'Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.'**\n   - This means either T = 4 (Statement 3 is true) or F = 3 (Statement 4 is true), but not both simultaneously.\n\n6. **Statement 6: 'The number of true statements is a prime number.'**\n   - The prime numbers less than or equal to 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n   - Therefore, T could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7: 'The number of false statements is a composite number.'**\n   - The composite numbers less than or equal to 7 are 4 and 6.\n   - Therefore, F could be 4 or 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values for T and F:\n\n- If T = 4, then F = 3. This satisfies Statements 3 and 4, but violates Statement 5 (since both cannot be true simultaneously).\n- If T = 5, then F = 2. This satisfies Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 6 (since 5 is prime), but violates Statement 7 (since 2 is not composite).\n- If T = 6, then F = 1. This satisfies Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 7 (since 1 is not composite), but violates Statement 6 (since 6 is not prime).\n- If T = 7, then F = 0. This satisfies Statement 1, Statement 2, and Statement 6 (since 7 is prime), but violates Statement 7 (since 0 is not composite).\n\nGiven these analyses, the only possible value for T that satisfies all conditions is T = 5, with F = 2. However, this violates Statement 7. Therefore, there is no consistent solution that satisfies all the given statements.\n\nThus, the number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
