    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the truthfulness of each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's go through each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements (T) is 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 2 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means the number of false statements (F) is 0, 1, or 2.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means T = 1.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 1 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means F = 1.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either Statement 3 is true and Statement 4 is false, or Statement 3 is false and Statement 4 is true.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - Possible values for T that are prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - Possible values for F that are composite numbers are 4 and 6.\n\nNow, let's analyze the compatibility of these statements:\n\n- If Statement 3 is true (T = 1), then Statement 4 must be false (F ≠ 1). However, this contradicts Statement 1, which requires at least 3 true statements. Therefore, Statement 3 cannot be true.\n\n- If Statement 4 is true (F = 1), then Statement 3 must be false (T ≠ 1). This means T = 6, which is not a prime number, contradicting Statement 6. Therefore, Statement 4 cannot be true.\n\nSince neither Statement 3 nor Statement 4 can be true, Statement 5 is false.\n\nNow, let's consider the remaining statements:\n\n- Statement 1 requires T ≥ 3.\n- Statement 2 requires F ≤ 2.\n- Statement 6 requires T to be a prime number (2, 3, 5, or 7).\n- Statement 7 requires F to be a composite number (4 or 6).\n\nGiven these conditions, let's evaluate possible values for T and F:\n\n- If T = 3 (prime), then F = 4 (composite), which satisfies all conditions.\n- If T = 5 (prime), then F = 2, which is not composite, so this is not possible.\n- If T = 7 (prime), then F = 0, which is not composite, so this is not possible.\n\nTherefore, the only possible solution is T = 3 and F = 4.\n\nThus, there is only one possible solution that satisfies all the given statements.\n\nThe number of possible solutions is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
