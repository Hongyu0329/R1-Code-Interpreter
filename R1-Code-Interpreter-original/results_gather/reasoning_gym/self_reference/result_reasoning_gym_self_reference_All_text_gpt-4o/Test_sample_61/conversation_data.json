    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze each statement and determine the number of possible solutions that satisfy all the given conditions. Let's go through each statement step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1**: \"At least 3 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means the number of true statements (T) is 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n2. **Statement 2**: \"At most 0 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This implies that all statements are true, i.e., T = 7.\n\n3. **Statement 3**: \"Exactly 4 of these 7 statements are true.\"\n   - This means T = 4.\n\n4. **Statement 4**: \"Exactly 3 of these 7 statements are false.\"\n   - This means T = 4, since 7 - 3 = 4.\n\n5. **Statement 5**: \"Either Statement 3 or Statement 4 is true, but not both.\"\n   - This means either T = 4 (Statement 3 is true) or T = 4 (Statement 4 is true), but not both. However, since both statements imply T = 4, this condition is automatically satisfied if T = 4.\n\n6. **Statement 6**: \"The number of true statements is a prime number.\"\n   - The prime numbers between 1 and 7 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. So, T could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n\n7. **Statement 7**: \"The number of false statements is a composite number.\"\n   - The composite numbers between 0 and 6 are 4 and 6. So, the number of false statements (F) could be 4 or 6. Since F = 7 - T, this implies T = 3 or T = 1.\n\nNow, let's combine these conditions:\n\n- From Statement 1, T ≥ 3.\n- From Statement 2, T = 7.\n- From Statement 3, T = 4.\n- From Statement 4, T = 4.\n- From Statement 5, T = 4.\n- From Statement 6, T could be 2, 3, 5, or 7.\n- From Statement 7, T could be 3 or 1.\n\nCombining all these, the only value that satisfies all conditions is T = 4. This satisfies:\n- Statement 1 (since 4 ≥ 3),\n- Statement 3 (exactly 4 are true),\n- Statement 4 (exactly 3 are false),\n- Statement 5 (either Statement 3 or 4 is true, but not both),\n- Statement 6 (4 is not a prime, but this is not a contradiction since Statement 6 can be false),\n- Statement 7 (3 false statements is not composite, but this is not a contradiction since Statement 7 can be false).\n\nThus, the number of possible solutions is 1, as T = 4 is the only consistent solution.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<1>>>."
