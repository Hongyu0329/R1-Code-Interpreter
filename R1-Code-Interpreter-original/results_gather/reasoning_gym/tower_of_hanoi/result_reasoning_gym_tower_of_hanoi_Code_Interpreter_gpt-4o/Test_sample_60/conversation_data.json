    "\nassistant > The Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 pegs is a more complex version of the classic 3-peg problem. The Frame-Stewart algorithm is a well-known approach to solve this problem. It involves breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and using an additional peg to minimize the number of moves.\n\nLet's solve the problem for 6 disks and 4 pegs, moving all disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3.
