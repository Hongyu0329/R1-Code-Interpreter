    "\nassistant > The Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 pegs is a variation of the classic problem, which allows for more efficient solutions than the traditional 3-peg version. The Frame-Stewart algorithm is a well-known method for solving the 4-peg Tower of Hanoi problem. Let's apply this algorithm to solve the problem with 4 disks and 4 pegs, moving all disks from Peg 4 to Peg 1.\n\nI'll calculate the sequence of moves for you.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [(source, target)]\n    \n    # Frame-Stewart algorithm: find the optimal k\n    min_moves = float('inf')\n    best_k = 0\n    for k in range(1, n):\n        moves = 2 * len(hanoi_4_pegs(k, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target)) + len(hanoi_4_pegs(n-k, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2))\n        if moves < min_moves:\n            min_moves = moves\n            best_k = k\n    \n    # Move k disks to auxiliary1\n    moves = hanoi_4_pegs(best_k, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target)\n    # Move n-k disks to target\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(n-best_k, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2)\n    # Move k disks from auxiliary1 to target\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(best_k, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2)\n    \n    return moves\n\n# Solve the problem for 4 disks\nmoves = hanoi_4_pegs(4, 4, 1, 2, 3)\n\n# Format the moves\nformatted_moves = [f\"Move disk {i+1} from Peg {move[0]} to Peg {move[1]}\" for i, move in enumerate(moves)]\nformatted_moves\nassistant > Here is the sequence of moves to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 disks and 4 pegs, moving all disks from Peg 4 to Peg 1:\n\n```\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 6 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 7 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n```\n\nPlease note that the disk numbers in the output are sequential and do not correspond to the actual disk sizes.
