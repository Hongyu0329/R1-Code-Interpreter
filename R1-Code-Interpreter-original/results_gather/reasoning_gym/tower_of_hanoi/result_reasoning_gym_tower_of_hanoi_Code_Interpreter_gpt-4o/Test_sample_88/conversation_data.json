    "\nassistant > To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks, we can use a recursive approach. The solution involves moving the top \\( n-1 \\) disks from the source peg to an auxiliary peg, then moving the nth disk directly to the target peg, and finally moving the \\( n-1 \\) disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\nLet's compute the sequence of moves for 7 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 using Peg 3 as an auxiliary peg.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef tower_of_hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):\n    if n == 1:\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n        return\n    tower_of_hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)\n    moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n    tower_of_hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)\n\n# Initialize the list to store the sequence of moves\nmoves = []\n# Solve the Tower of Hanoi problem for 7 disks\ntower_of_hanoi(7, 1, 2, 3, moves)\n\n# Format the output\nformatted_moves = \"\\n\".join(moves)\nformatted_moves = f\"<<<{formatted_moves}>>>\"\nformatted_moves[:500]  #
