    "\nassistant > To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks, we can use a recursive approach. The solution involves moving the top \\( n-1 \\) disks from the source peg to an auxiliary peg, then moving the nth disk to the destination peg, and finally moving the \\( n-1 \\) disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.\n\nLet's compute the sequence of moves for 7 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3 using Peg 2 as an auxiliary peg.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef tower_of_hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):\n    if n == 1:\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n        return\n    tower_of_hanoi(n -
