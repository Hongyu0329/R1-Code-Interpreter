    "\nassistant > The Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks and 4 pegs can be solved using the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is a generalization of the classic Tower of Hanoi problem. The algorithm involves moving a subset of disks to an intermediate peg, moving the remaining disks to the destination peg, and then moving the subset from the intermediate peg to the destination peg.\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step:\n\n1. Move the top 2 disks to an intermediate peg (Peg 2).\n2. Move the largest disk directly to the destination peg (Peg 4).\n3. Move the 2 disks from the intermediate peg (Peg 2) to the destination peg (Peg 4).\n\nLet's write out the sequence of moves:\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef tower_of_hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, moves):\n    if n == 0:\n        return\n    if n == 1:\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n        return\n\n    # Move top n-2 disks from source to auxiliary1 using auxiliary2 and target\n    tower_of_hanoi_4_pegs(n-2, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target, moves)\n\n    # Move the (n-1)th disk from source to auxiliary2\n    moves.append(f\"Move disk {n-1} from Peg {source} to Peg {auxiliary2}\")\n\n    # Move the nth disk from source to target\n    moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n\n    # Move the (n-1)th disk from auxiliary2 to target\n    moves.append(f\"Move disk {n-1} from Peg {auxiliary2} to Peg {target}\")\n\n    # Move the n-2 disks from auxiliary1 to target using source and auxiliary2\n    tower_of_hanoi_4_pegs(n-2, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2, moves)\n\n# Initialize variables\nmoves = []\nn_disks = 3\ntower_of_hanoi_4_pegs(n_disks, 1, 4, 2, 3, moves)\nmoves\nassistant > The sequence of moves to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks and 4 pegs is as follows:\n\n```\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n```\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4  \n>>>"
