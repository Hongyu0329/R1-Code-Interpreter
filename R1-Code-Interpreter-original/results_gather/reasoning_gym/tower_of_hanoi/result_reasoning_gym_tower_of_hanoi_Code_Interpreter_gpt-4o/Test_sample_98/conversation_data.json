    "\nassistant > The Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 pegs is a more complex version of the classic 3-peg problem. The Frame-Stewart algorithm is a well-known approach to solve this problem optimally. The algorithm involves breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and using an additional peg to minimize the number of moves.\n\nLet's solve the problem for 7 disks and 4 pegs, moving all disks from Peg 3 to Peg 4. I'll calculate the sequence of moves using the Frame-Stewart algorithm.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, moves):\n    if n == 0:\n        return\n    if n == 1:\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n        return\n\n    # Find the optimal number of disks to move in the first step\n    k = n -
