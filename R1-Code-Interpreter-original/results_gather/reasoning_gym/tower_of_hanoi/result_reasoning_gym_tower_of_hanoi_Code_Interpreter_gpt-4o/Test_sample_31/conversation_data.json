    "\nassistant > The Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 pegs is a more complex version of the classic 3-peg problem. The Frame-Stewart algorithm is a well-known approach to solve this problem optimally. The algorithm involves breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and solving them recursively.\n\nLet's solve the problem for 6 disks and 4 pegs, moving all disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2.
