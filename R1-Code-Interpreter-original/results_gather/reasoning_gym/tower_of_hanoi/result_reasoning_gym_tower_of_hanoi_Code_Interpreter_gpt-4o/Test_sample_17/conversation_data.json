    "\nassistant > The Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 pegs is a variation of the classic problem, which allows for more efficient solutions than the traditional 3-peg version. The goal is to move all disks from the source peg to the destination peg using the additional pegs as auxiliary storage.\n\nFor 3 disks and 4 pegs, we can use the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is a recursive method to solve the problem efficiently. Let's determine the sequence of moves:\n\n1. Move the top 2 disks to an auxiliary peg.\n2. Move the largest disk directly to the destination peg.\n3. Move the 2 disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.\n\nLet's calculate the sequence of moves.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, moves):\n    if n == 0:\n        return\n    if n == 1:\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n        return\n\n    # Move top n-2 disks to auxiliary1\n    hanoi_4_pegs(n-2, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target, moves)\n    \n    # Move the (n-1)th disk to auxiliary2\n    moves.append(f\"Move disk {n-1} from Peg {source} to Peg {auxiliary2}\")\n    \n    # Move the nth disk to target\n    moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n    \n    # Move the (n-1)th disk from auxiliary2 to target\n    moves.append(f\"Move disk {n-1} from Peg {auxiliary2} to Peg {target}\")\n    \n    # Move the n-2 disks from auxiliary1 to target\n    hanoi_4_pegs(n-2, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2, moves)\n\n# Initialize the list to store the sequence of moves\nmoves = []\n\n# Solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks and 4 pegs\nhanoi_4_pegs(3, 4, 1, 2, 3, moves)\n\n# Format the moves as a single string\nsequence_of_moves = \"\\n\".join(moves)\nsequence_of_moves\nassistant > The sequence of moves to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks and 4 pegs, moving all disks from Peg 4 to Peg 1, is as follows:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n>>>"
