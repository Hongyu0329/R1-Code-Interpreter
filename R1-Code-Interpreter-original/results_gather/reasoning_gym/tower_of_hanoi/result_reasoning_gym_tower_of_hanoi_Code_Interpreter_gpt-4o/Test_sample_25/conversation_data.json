    "\nassistant > The Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks and 4 pegs can be solved using the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is a generalization of the classic Tower of Hanoi problem. The algorithm involves moving disks between pegs in a way that minimizes the total number of moves.\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step and provide the sequence of moves.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [(source, target)]\n    \n    # Move n-2 disks from source to auxiliary1 using auxiliary2 and target\n    moves = hanoi_4_pegs(n-2, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target)\n    \n    # Move the (n-1)th disk from source to auxiliary2\n    moves.append((source, auxiliary2))\n    \n    # Move the nth disk from source to target\n    moves.append((source, target))\n    \n    # Move the (n-1)th disk from auxiliary2 to target\n    moves.append((auxiliary2, target))\n    \n    # Move n-2 disks from auxiliary1 to target using source and auxiliary2\n    moves.extend(hanoi_4_pegs(n-2, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2))\n    \n    return moves\n\n# Solve the problem for 3 disks and 4 pegs\nmoves = hanoi_4_pegs(3, 1, 4, 2, 3)\n\n# Format the moves\nformatted_moves = [f\"Move disk {i+1} from Peg {move[0]} to Peg {move[1]}\" for i, move in enumerate(moves)]\nformatted_moves\nassistant > The sequence of moves to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks and 4 pegs is as follows:\n\n```\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n```\n\nHowever, it seems there was a mistake in the labeling of the disks in the output. Let's correct this and provide the correct sequence of moves.# Correct the disk numbering in the moves\ncorrected_moves = []\ndisk_positions = {1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1}  # Initial positions of the disks\n\nfor move in moves:\n    # Find the disk to move based on the current position\n    disk_to_move = next(disk for disk, position in disk_positions.items() if position == move[0])\n    # Update the position of the moved disk\n    disk_positions[disk_to_move] = move[1]\n    # Format the move\n    corrected_moves.append(f\"Move disk {disk_to_move} from Peg {move[0]} to Peg {move[1]}\")\n\ncorrected_moves\nassistant > The corrected sequence of moves to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks and 4 pegs is as follows:\n\n```\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n>>>"
