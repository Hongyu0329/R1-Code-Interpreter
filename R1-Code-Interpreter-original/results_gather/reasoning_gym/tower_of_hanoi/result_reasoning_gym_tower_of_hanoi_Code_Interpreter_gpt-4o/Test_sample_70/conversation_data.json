    "\nassistant > The Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 pegs is a variation of the classic problem, which allows for more efficient solutions than the traditional 3-peg version. The Frame-Stewart algorithm is a well-known approach to solve this problem optimally.\n\nLet's solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 disks and 4 pegs, moving all disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3.
