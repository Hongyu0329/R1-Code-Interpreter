    "\nassistant > To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks and 3 pegs, we need to move all disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2 following the rules provided. Let's determine the sequence of moves:\n\n1. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n2. Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n3. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n4. Move disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n5. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n6. Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n7. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n8. Move disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n9. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n10. Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n11. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n12. Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n13.
