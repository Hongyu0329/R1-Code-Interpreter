    "\nassistant > The Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 pegs is a more complex version of the classic 3-peg problem. The optimal solution for the 4-peg version is not straightforward and requires a specific strategy. One of the known strategies is the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which involves breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems.\n\nLet's solve the problem for 7 disks and 4 pegs using this approach. I'll compute the sequence of moves.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [(1, source, target)]\n    \n    # Find the optimal number of disks to move in the first step\n    k = n // 2\n    \n    # Move k disks to auxiliary1 using all pegs\n    moves = hanoi_4_pegs(k, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target)\n    \n    # Move the remaining n-k disks directly to the target using 3 pegs\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n - k, source, target, auxiliary2)\n    \n    # Move the k disks from auxiliary1 to target using all pegs\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(k, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2)\n    \n    return moves\n\ndef hanoi_3_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [(1, source, target)]\n    \n    moves = hanoi_3_pegs(n - 1, source, auxiliary, target)\n    moves.append((n, source, target))\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n - 1, auxiliary, target, source)\n    \n    return moves\n\n# Solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks and 4 pegs\nmoves = hanoi_4_pegs(7, 1, 3, 2, 4)\n\n# Format the moves as required\nformatted_moves = [f\"Move disk {disk} from Peg {src} to Peg {tgt}\" for disk, src, tgt in moves]\nformatted_moves\nassistant > Here is the sequence of moves to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks and 4 pegs, moving all disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3:\n\n```\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n>>>\n```"
