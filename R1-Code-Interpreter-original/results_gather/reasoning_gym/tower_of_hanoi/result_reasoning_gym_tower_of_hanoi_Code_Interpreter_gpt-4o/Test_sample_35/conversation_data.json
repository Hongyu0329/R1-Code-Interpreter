    "\nassistant > To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks and 3 pegs, where the disks need to be moved from Peg 2 to Peg 3, we can follow a recursive approach. Here is the sequence of moves:\n\n1. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n2. Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n3. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n4. Move disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n5. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n6. Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n7. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n\nThe sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \n>>>"
