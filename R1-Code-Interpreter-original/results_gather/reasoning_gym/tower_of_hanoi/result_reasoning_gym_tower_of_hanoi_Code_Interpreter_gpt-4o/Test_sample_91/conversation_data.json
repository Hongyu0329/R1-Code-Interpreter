    "\nassistant > The Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks and 4 pegs is a variation of the classic problem. The additional peg allows for potentially fewer moves compared to the standard 3-peg version. Let's solve this problem and provide the sequence of moves.\n\nTo solve the problem, we can use the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is a generalization for the Tower of Hanoi problem with more than three pegs. Here's the sequence of moves:\n\n1. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n2. Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n3. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n4. Move disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n5. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n6. Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n7. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n\nThe sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n>>>"
