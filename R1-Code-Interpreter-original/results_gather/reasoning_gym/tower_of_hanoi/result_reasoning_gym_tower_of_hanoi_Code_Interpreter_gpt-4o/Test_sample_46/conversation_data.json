    "\nassistant > To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 disks and 3 pegs, we can use a recursive approach. The goal is to move all disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3, following the rules provided. Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Move the top 3 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1, using Peg 3 as auxiliary.\n2. Move the 4th disk from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n3.
