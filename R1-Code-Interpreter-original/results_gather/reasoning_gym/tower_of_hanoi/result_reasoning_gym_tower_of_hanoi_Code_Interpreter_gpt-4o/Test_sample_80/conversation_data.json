    "\nassistant > The Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 pegs is a more complex version of the classic 3-peg problem. The Frame-Stewart algorithm is a well-known approach to solve this problem, but it can be quite complex to implement manually for a specific number of disks and pegs.\n\nFor 6 disks and 4 pegs, the solution involves breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems. Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Move the top 3 disks to an auxiliary peg.\n2. Move the remaining 3 disks directly to the destination peg.\n3. Move the 3 disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.\n\nLet's compute the sequence of moves for this problem.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, moves):\n    if n == 0:\n        return\n    if n == 1:\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n        return\n\n    # Move top n-2 disks to auxiliary1\n    hanoi_4_pegs(n-2, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target, moves)\n    \n    # Move the (n-1)th disk to auxiliary2\n    moves.append(f\"Move disk {n-1} from Peg {source} to Peg {auxiliary2}\")\n    \n    # Move the nth disk to target\n    moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n    \n    # Move the (n-1)th disk from auxiliary2 to target\n    moves.append(f\"Move disk {n-1} from Peg {auxiliary2} to Peg {target}\")\n    \n    # Move the n-2 disks from auxiliary1 to target\n    hanoi_4_pegs(n-2, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2, moves)\n\n# Initialize the list to store the moves\nmoves = []\n\n# Solve the problem for 6 disks, moving from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nhanoi_4_pegs(6, 4, 2, 1, 3, moves)\n\n# Format the moves for output\nformatted_moves = \"\\n\".join(moves)\nformatted_moves\nassistant > Here is the sequence of moves to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 6 disks and 4 pegs, moving all disks from Peg 4 to Peg 2:\n\n```\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 6 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n```\n\nThis sequence of moves will successfully transfer all disks from Peg 4 to Peg 2 following the rules of the Tower of Hanoi problem."
