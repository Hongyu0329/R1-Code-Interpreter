    "\nassistant > The Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 pegs is a variation of the classic problem, and it allows for more efficient solutions than the traditional 3-peg version. The Frame-Stewart algorithm is a well-known approach to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with more than three pegs.\n\nFor 3 disks and 4 pegs, the Frame-Stewart algorithm suggests the following steps:\n\n1. Move the top \\( n-k \\) disks to an auxiliary peg.\n2. Move the remaining \\( k \\) disks directly to the destination peg.\n3. Move the \\( n-k \\) disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.\n\nLet's apply this algorithm to solve the problem with 3 disks and 4 pegs, moving all disks from Peg 2 to Peg 4. We'll determine the optimal value of \\( k \\) and provide the sequence of moves.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [(1, source, target)]\n    \n    # Use Frame-Stewart algorithm to find the optimal k\n    k = n - 1\n    \n    # Move top n-k disks to auxiliary1\n    moves = hanoi_4_pegs(n - k, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target)\n    \n    # Move k disks directly to target\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(k, source, target, auxiliary2)\n    \n    # Move n-k disks from auxiliary1 to target\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(n - k, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2)\n    \n    return moves\n\ndef hanoi_3_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [(1, source, target)]\n    \n    moves = hanoi_3_pegs(n - 1, source, auxiliary, target)\n    moves.append((n, source, target))\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n - 1, auxiliary, target, source)\n    \n    return moves\n\n# Solve the problem with 3 disks, moving from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nmoves = hanoi_4_pegs(3, 2, 4, 1, 3)\nformatted_moves = [f\"Move disk {disk} from Peg {src} to Peg {tgt}\" for disk, src, tgt in moves]\nformatted_moves\nassistant > The sequence of moves to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks and 4 pegs, moving all disks from Peg 2 to Peg 4, is as follows:\n\n```\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\n>>>"
