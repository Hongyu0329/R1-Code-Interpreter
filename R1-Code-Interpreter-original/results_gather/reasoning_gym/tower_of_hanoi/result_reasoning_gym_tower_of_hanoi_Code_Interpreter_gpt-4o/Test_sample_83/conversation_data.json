    "\nassistant > To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 5 disks, we can use a recursive approach. The idea is to move the top \\( n-1 \\) disks from the source peg to an auxiliary peg, then move the nth disk to the destination peg, and finally move the \\( n-1 \\) disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.\n\nLet's implement this approach to generate the sequence of moves for 5 disks.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef tower_of_hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):\n    if n == 1:\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n        return\n    tower_of_hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)\n    moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n    tower_of_hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)\n\n# Initialize the list to store the sequence of moves\nmoves = []\n\n# Solve the Tower of Hanoi problem for 5 disks\ntower_of_hanoi(5, 1, 3, 2, moves)\n\n# Format the output\nformatted_moves = \"\\n\".join(moves)\nformatted_moves\nassistant > Here is the sequence of moves to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 5 disks:\n\n```\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n```\n\nThis sequence will successfully move all disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3 following the rules of the Tower of Hanoi."
