    "\nassistant > The Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 pegs is a more complex variation of the classic 3-peg problem. The Frame-Stewart algorithm is a well-known approach to solve this problem, but it is not straightforward to implement manually for a large number of disks. However, I can provide a solution using a recursive approach.\n\nLet's solve the problem for 7 disks and 4 pegs, moving all disks from Peg 3 to Peg 4. I'll compute the sequence of moves.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, moves):\n    if n == 0:\n        return\n    if n == 1:\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n        return\n\n    # Find the optimal number of disks to move in the first step\n    k = n - 1\n    while k > 0:\n        if (2 * (2**k - 1) + (2**(n-k) - 1)) <= (2**n - 1):\n            break\n        k -= 1\n\n    # Move k disks to auxiliary1 using all pegs\n    hanoi_4_pegs(k, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target, moves)\n    # Move the remaining n-k disks to target using 3 pegs\n    hanoi_3_pegs(n-k, source, target, auxiliary2, moves)\n    # Move k disks from auxiliary1 to target using all pegs\n    hanoi_4_pegs(k, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2, moves)\n\ndef hanoi_3_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):\n    if n == 0:\n        return\n    if n == 1:\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n        return\n    hanoi_3_pegs(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)\n    moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n    hanoi_3_pegs(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)\n\n# Initialize the list to store the moves\nmoves = []\n\n# Solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks and 4 pegs\nhanoi_4_pegs(7, 3, 4, 1, 2, moves)\n\n# Return the sequence of moves\nmoves[:10], len(moves)  # Display the first 10 moves and the total number of moves\nassistant > The sequence of moves to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks and 4 pegs, moving all disks from Peg 3 to Peg 4, is as follows:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n...\n>>>\n\nThe total number of moves required is 127.
