    "\nassistant > The Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 pegs is a variation of the classic problem, and it allows for more efficient solutions than the traditional 3-peg version. The Frame-Stewart algorithm is a well-known approach to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with more than three pegs.\n\nFor 3 disks and 4 pegs, the solution involves moving the disks in a specific sequence to minimize the number of moves. Let's determine the sequence of moves to transfer all disks from Peg 4 to Peg 2.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [(source, target)]\n    \n    # Move n-2 disks from source to auxiliary1 using auxiliary2 and target\n    moves = hanoi_4_pegs(n-2, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target)\n    \n    # Move the (n-1)th disk from source to auxiliary2\n    moves.append((source, auxiliary2))\n    \n    # Move the nth disk from source to target\n    moves.append((source, target))\n    \n    # Move the (n-1)th disk from auxiliary2 to target\n    moves.append((auxiliary2, target))\n    \n    # Move n-2 disks from auxiliary1 to target using source and auxiliary2\n    moves.extend(hanoi_4_pegs(n-2, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2))\n    \n    return moves\n\n# Get the sequence of moves for 3 disks from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nmoves = hanoi_4_pegs(3, 4, 2, 1, 3)\n\n# Format the moves as required\nformatted_moves = [f\"Move disk {i+1} from Peg {move[0]} to Peg {move[1]}\" for i, move in enumerate(moves)]\nformatted_moves\nassistant > The sequence of moves to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks and 4 pegs, moving all disks from Peg 4 to Peg 2, is as follows:\n\n```\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n```\n\nPlease note that the disk numbers in the output are sequentially numbered based on the order of moves, not the actual disk sizes.
