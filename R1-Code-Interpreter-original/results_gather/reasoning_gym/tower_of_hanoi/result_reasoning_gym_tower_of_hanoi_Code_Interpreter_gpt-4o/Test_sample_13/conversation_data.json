    "\nassistant > The Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 pegs is a more complex version of the classic 3-peg problem. The optimal solution for the 4-peg version is not straightforward and requires a specific strategy. One of the known strategies is the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which involves breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems.\n\nLet's solve the problem for 5 disks and 4 pegs, moving all disks from Peg 4 to Peg 2.
