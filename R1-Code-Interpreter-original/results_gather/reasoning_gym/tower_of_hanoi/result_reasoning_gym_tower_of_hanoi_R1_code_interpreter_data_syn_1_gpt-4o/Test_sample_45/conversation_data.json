    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 5 disks and 4 pegs, we need to use an algorithm that efficiently utilizes the extra peg to minimize the number of moves. The classic Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 pegs is well-known, but with 4 pegs, the Frame-Stewart algorithm is often used to find an optimal solution.\n\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm involves:\n1. Moving a subset of the largest disks to an auxiliary peg.\n2. Moving the remaining disks to the destination peg using the standard 3-peg solution.\n3. Moving the subset of disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.\n\nLet's implement this algorithm to find the sequence of moves for 5 disks and 4 pegs, moving from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\"]\n    \n    # Find the optimal number of disks to move to the auxiliary peg\n    k = n - 2\n    moves = []\n    \n    # Move k disks to auxiliary1\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(k, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target)\n    \n    # Move the remaining n-k disks to target using 3 pegs\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n-k, source, target, auxiliary2)\n    \n    # Move k disks from auxiliary1 to target\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(k, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2)\n    \n    return moves\n\ndef hanoi_3_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\"]\n    \n    moves = []\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)\n    moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)\n    \n    return moves\n\n# Solve the problem for 5 disks, moving from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nmoves = hanoi_4_pegs(5, 2, 1, 3, 4)\nfor move in moves:\n    print(move)\n```\n\nThis code will generate the sequence of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 5 disks and 4 pegs, moving from Peg 2 to Peg 1. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "It seems there was an error in the logic of the code, particularly in the way the Frame-Stewart algorithm was implemented. The Frame-Stewart algorithm is a bit more complex and requires careful handling of the number of disks moved to the auxiliary pegs. Let's correct the approach and ensure the solution is optimal.\n\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm involves:\n1. Moving a subset of the largest disks to an auxiliary peg.\n2. Solving the remaining disks using the standard 3-peg solution.\n3.

    "It seems the code is not correctly implementing the Frame-Stewart algorithm for the 4-peg Tower of Hanoi problem. The logic for determining the optimal number of disks to move to the auxiliary peg is not correctly applied.
