    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 disks and 4 pegs, we need to use an algorithm that efficiently moves the disks from the source peg to the target peg while adhering to the rules. The classic Tower of Hanoi problem is typically solved with 3 pegs, but with 4 pegs, we can use the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is a generalization for more than 3 pegs.\n\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm involves:\n1. Moving a subset of the top disks to an auxiliary peg.\n2. Moving the remaining disks directly to the target peg.\n3. Moving the subset from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\nFor 4 disks and 4 pegs, the optimal strategy involves moving the top 2 disks to an auxiliary peg, then moving the remaining 2 disks directly to the target peg, and finally moving the top 2 disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\nLet's implement this strategy in Python to generate the sequence of moves.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\"]\n    \n    moves = []\n    # Move top n-2 disks to auxiliary1\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(n-2, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target)\n    # Move the next two disks to target\n    moves.append(f\"Move disk {n-1} from Peg {source} to Peg {auxiliary2}\")\n    moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n    moves.append(f\"Move disk {n-1} from Peg {auxiliary2} to Peg {target}\")\n    # Move the n-2 disks from auxiliary1 to target\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(n-2, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2)\n    \n    return moves\n\n# Generate the sequence of moves for 4 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nmoves = hanoi_4_pegs(4, 2, 3, 1, 4)\nprint(\"\\n\".join(moves))\n```\n\nThis code will generate the sequence of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 disks and 4 pegs, moving the disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the sequence of moves to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 disks and 4 pegs, moving the disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3. There were no errors in the execution.\n\nThe sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\n>>>"
