    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 6 disks and 4 pegs, we need to use an efficient algorithm that minimizes the number of moves. The classic Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 pegs has a well-known solution, but with 4 pegs, the problem becomes more complex.\n\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm is a well-known approach for solving the Tower of Hanoi problem with more than 3 pegs. The algorithm involves recursively breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems, using an optimal number of moves to transfer disks between pegs.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Move the top k disks to an auxiliary peg.\n2. Move the remaining n-k disks directly to the destination peg using the remaining pegs.\n3. Move the k disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.\n\nThe challenge is to determine the optimal value of k that minimizes the total number of moves. For 6 disks and 4 pegs, we can use the Frame-Stewart algorithm to find the sequence of moves.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the sequence of moves.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [(1, source, target)]\n    \n    # Find the optimal k\n    min_moves = float('inf')\n    best_k = 0\n    for k in range(1, n):\n        moves = 2 * len(hanoi_4_pegs(k, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target)) + len(hanoi_4_pegs(n-k, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2))\n        if moves < min_moves:\n            min_moves = moves\n            best_k = k\n    \n    # Move the top k disks to auxiliary1\n    moves = hanoi_4_pegs(best_k, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target)\n    # Move the remaining n-k disks to target\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(n-best_k, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2)\n    # Move the k disks from auxiliary1 to target\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(best_k, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2)\n    \n    return moves\n\n# Generate the sequence of moves\nmoves = hanoi_4_pegs(6, 3, 4, 1, 2)\n\n# Format the output\nformatted_moves = [f\"Move disk {disk} from Peg {src} to Peg {dst}\" for disk, src, dst in moves]\nprint(\"\\n\".join(formatted_moves))\n```\n\nThis code will generate the sequence of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 6 disks and 4 pegs, moving all disks from Peg 3 to Peg 4.",
    "The output indicates that there is an issue with the implementation of the algorithm. Specifically, the code is not correctly tracking the disk numbers, resulting in repeated moves of \"disk 1\" instead of the correct sequence of moves for all disks.\n\nTo fix this, we need to ensure that the algorithm correctly tracks and moves each disk by its number. Let's revise the code to address this issue.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [(n, source, target)]\n    \n    # Find the optimal k\n    min_moves = float('inf')\n    best_k = 0\n    for k in range(1, n):\n        moves = 2 * len(hanoi_4_pegs(k, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target)) + len(hanoi_4_pegs(n-k, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2))\n        if moves < min_moves:\n            min_moves = moves\n            best_k = k\n    \n    # Move the top k disks to auxiliary1\n    moves = hanoi_4_pegs(best_k, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target)\n    # Move the remaining n-k disks to target\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(n-best_k, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2)\n    # Move the k disks from auxiliary1 to target\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(best_k, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2)\n    \n    return moves\n\n# Generate the sequence of moves\nmoves = hanoi_4_pegs(6, 3, 4, 1, 2)\n\n# Format the output\nformatted_moves = [f\"Move disk {disk} from Peg {src} to Peg {dst}\" for disk, src, dst in moves]\nprint(\"\\n\".join(formatted_moves))\n```\n\nThis revised code should correctly generate the sequence of moves for the Tower of Hanoi problem with 6 disks and 4 pegs, ensuring that each disk is moved appropriately.",
    "The issue persists because the algorithm is not correctly handling the disk numbers. The recursive function is not properly tracking which disk is being moved, leading to incorrect output.

    "The output indicates that the algorithm is not correctly implementing the Frame-Stewart approach for the Tower of Hanoi with 4 pegs.
