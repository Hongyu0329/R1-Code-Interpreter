    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 5 disks and 4 pegs, we need to use an efficient algorithm that minimizes the number of moves. The classic Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 pegs has a well-known solution, but with 4 pegs, the problem becomes more complex. \n\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm is a well-known approach for solving the Tower of Hanoi problem with more than 3 pegs. The algorithm involves recursively solving smaller subproblems and using an additional peg to reduce the number of moves.\n\nHere's the general approach:\n1. Move the top k disks to an auxiliary peg using all pegs.\n2. Move the remaining disks directly to the destination peg using the remaining pegs.\n3. Move the k disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.\n\nThe challenge is to determine the optimal value of k, which minimizes the total number of moves. For 5 disks and 4 pegs, we can use this approach to find the sequence of moves.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the sequence of moves:\n\n```python\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [(1, source, target)]\n    \n    # Find the optimal k\n    k = n - 2\n    moves = []\n    \n    # Move top k disks to auxiliary1\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(k, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target)\n    \n    # Move remaining disks to target using auxiliary2\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n - k, source, target, auxiliary2)\n    \n    # Move k disks from auxiliary1 to target\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(k, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2)\n    \n    return moves\n\ndef hanoi_3_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [(1, source, target)]\n    \n    moves = []\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n - 1, source, auxiliary, target)\n    moves.append((n, source, target))\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n - 1, auxiliary, target, source)\n    \n    return moves\n\n# Solve the problem for 5 disks and 4 pegs\nmoves = hanoi_4_pegs(5, 4, 1, 2, 3)\n\n# Format the output\nformatted_moves = [f\"Move disk {disk} from Peg {src} to Peg {dst}\" for disk, src, dst in moves]\nprint(\"\\n\".join(formatted_moves))\n```\n\nThis code will generate the sequence of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 5 disks and 4 pegs, moving all disks from Peg 4 to Peg 1. Let's execute the code to get the result.",

Let's revisit the problem and ensure the algorithm is correctly implemented for the 4-peg Tower of Hanoi problem.\n\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm is a recursive method that involves:\n1. Moving a subset of disks to an auxiliary peg.\n2. Moving the remaining disks directly to the target peg.\n3.
