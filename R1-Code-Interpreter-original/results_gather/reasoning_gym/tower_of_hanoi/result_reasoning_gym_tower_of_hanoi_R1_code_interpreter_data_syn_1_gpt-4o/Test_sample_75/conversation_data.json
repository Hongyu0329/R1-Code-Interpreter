    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 disks and 4 pegs, we need to use an algorithm that efficiently moves the disks from the source peg to the target peg while adhering to the rules. The classic Tower of Hanoi problem is typically solved with 3 pegs, but with 4 pegs, we can use the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is a generalization for more than 3 pegs.\n\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm involves:\n1. Moving a subset of the largest disks to an auxiliary peg.\n2. Moving the remaining disks to the target peg using the remaining pegs.\n3. Finally, moving the subset of the largest disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\nLet's implement this algorithm in Python to find the sequence of moves.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\"]\n    \n    moves = []\n    k = n - 2  # Optimal number of disks to move to auxiliary peg\n    # Move k disks to auxiliary1\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(k, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target)\n    # Move remaining disks to target using auxiliary2\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n - k, source, target, auxiliary2)\n    # Move k disks from auxiliary1 to target\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(k, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2)\n    \n    return moves\n\ndef hanoi_3_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\"]\n    \n    moves = []\n    # Move n-1 disks to auxiliary\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n - 1, source, auxiliary, target)\n    # Move nth disk to target\n    moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n - 1, auxiliary, target, source)\n    \n    return moves\n\n# Solve the problem with 4 disks and 4 pegs\nmoves = hanoi_4_pegs(4, 4, 2, 1, 3)\nprint(\"\\n\".join(moves))\n```\n\nThis code will generate the sequence of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 disks and 4 pegs, moving all disks from Peg 4 to Peg 2. Let's execute the code to get the sequence of moves.",
    "It seems there was an error in the implementation of the Frame-Stewart algorithm for the 4-peg Tower of Hanoi problem. The code did not correctly handle the movement of disks using the additional pegs. Let's correct the approach and ensure that the algorithm properly utilizes all four pegs.\n\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm for 4 pegs involves:\n1. Moving a subset of the largest disks to an auxiliary peg.\n2. Moving the remaining disks to the target peg using the remaining pegs.\n3. Finally, moving the subset of the largest disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\nLet's refine the code to correctly implement this logic.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\"]\n    \n    moves = []\n    k = n - 1  # Optimal number of disks to move to auxiliary peg\n    # Move k disks to auxiliary1\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(k, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target)\n    # Move remaining disk to target using auxiliary2\n    moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n    # Move k disks from auxiliary1 to target\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(k, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2)\n    \n    return moves\n\n# Solve the problem with 4 disks and 4 pegs\nmoves = hanoi_4_pegs(4, 4, 2, 1, 3)\nprint(\"\\n\".join(moves))\n```\n\nLet's execute this refined code to get the correct sequence of moves.",
    "The output seems to be correct for moving 4 disks from Peg 4 to Peg 2 using 4 pegs. The sequence of moves follows the rules of the Tower of Hanoi problem, ensuring that only one disk is moved at a time and a larger disk is never placed on top of a smaller disk.\n\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm is designed to minimize the number of moves by optimally using the additional pegs. The sequence provided in the output is a valid solution for the 4-peg Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 disks.\n\nHere is the sequence of moves:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n>>>"
