    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks and 4 pegs, we need to find an optimal sequence of moves that transfers all disks from Peg 4 to Peg 1. The problem is a variation of the classic Tower of Hanoi, which typically involves 3 pegs. The addition of a fourth peg allows for potentially fewer moves, but the strategy becomes more complex.\n\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm is a well-known method for solving the Tower of Hanoi problem with more than three pegs. The algorithm involves recursively breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems, using the extra pegs to minimize the number of moves.\n\nLet's implement a solution using this approach:\n\n1. Move the top k disks to an auxiliary peg.\n2. Move the remaining disks to the destination peg.\n3. Move the k disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.\n\nWe will use Python to compute the sequence of moves.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [(1, source, target)]\n    \n    # Use Frame-Stewart algorithm\n    k = n - 1\n    moves = []\n    \n    # Step 1: Move top k disks to auxiliary1\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(k, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target)\n    \n    # Step 2: Move the nth disk to target\n    moves.append((n, source, target))\n    \n    # Step 3: Move k disks from auxiliary1 to target\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(k, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2)\n    \n    return moves\n\n# Get the sequence of moves\nmoves = hanoi_4_pegs(3, 4, 1, 2, 3)\n\n# Format the output\nformatted_moves = [f\"Move disk {disk} from Peg {src} to Peg {dst}\" for disk, src, dst in moves]\nprint(\"\\n\".join(formatted_moves))\n```\n\nThis code will generate the sequence of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks and 4 pegs, moving all disks from Peg 4 to Peg 1. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
