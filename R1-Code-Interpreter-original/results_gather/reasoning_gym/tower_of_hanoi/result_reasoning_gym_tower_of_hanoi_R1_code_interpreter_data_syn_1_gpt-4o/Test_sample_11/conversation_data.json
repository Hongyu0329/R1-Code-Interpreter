    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks and 4 pegs, we need to find an optimal sequence of moves that transfers all disks from Peg 2 to Peg 4. The additional peg allows for potentially more efficient solutions than the classic 3-peg problem.\n\nThe strategy involves using the extra peg to temporarily hold disks, allowing us to move larger disks more freely. The optimal solution for 3 disks and 4 pegs is known to be more efficient than the classic 3-peg solution.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. Move the smallest disk to an auxiliary peg.\n2. Move the second smallest disk to another auxiliary peg.\n3. Move the smallest disk on top of the second smallest disk.\n4. Move the largest disk directly to the destination peg.\n5. Move the two smaller disks on top of the largest disk at the destination peg.\n\nTo find the exact sequence of moves, we can use a recursive approach or a known algorithm for the 4-peg Tower of Hanoi problem. Let's implement this in Python to generate the sequence of moves.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\"]\n    \n    moves = []\n    # Move n-2 disks from source to auxiliary1 using auxiliary2 and target\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(n-2, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target)\n    # Move the (n-1)th disk to auxiliary2\n    moves.append(f\"Move disk {n-1} from Peg {source} to Peg {auxiliary2}\")\n    # Move the nth disk to target\n    moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n    # Move the (n-1)th disk from auxiliary2 to target\n    moves.append(f\"Move disk {n-1} from Peg {auxiliary2} to Peg {target}\")\n    # Move n-2 disks from auxiliary1 to target using source and auxiliary2\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(n-2, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2)\n    \n    return moves\n\n# Generate the sequence of moves for 3 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nmoves = hanoi_4_pegs(3, 2, 4, 1, 3)\nprint(\"\\n\".join(moves))\n```\n\nThis code will generate the sequence of moves for transferring 3 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 4 using 4 pegs. Let's execute it to get the result.",
