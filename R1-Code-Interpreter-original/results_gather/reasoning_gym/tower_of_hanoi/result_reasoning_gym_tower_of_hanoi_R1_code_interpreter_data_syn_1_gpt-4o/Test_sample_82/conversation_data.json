    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 disks and 3 pegs, we need to follow the rules and move the disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1. The classic recursive solution involves moving the top n-1 disks to an auxiliary peg, moving the nth disk to the target peg, and then moving the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\nLet's break down the steps for 4 disks:\n\n1. Move the top 3 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3 using Peg 1 as auxiliary.\n2. Move the 4th disk from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n3. Move the 3 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1 using Peg 2 as auxiliary.\n\nWe can implement this using a recursive function in Python to generate the sequence of moves.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):\n    if n == 1:\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n    else:\n        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)\n\nmoves = []\nhanoi(4, 2, 1, 3, moves)\nprint(\"\\n\".join(moves))\n```\n\nThis code will generate the sequence of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem for 4 disks, moving them from Peg 2 to Peg 1. Let's execute the code to get the sequence of moves.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the sequence of moves to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 disks, moving them from Peg 2 to Peg 1. There are no errors in the output. The sequence of moves is correct and follows the rules of the Tower of Hanoi.\n\nHere is the final answer:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n>>>"
