    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks and 3 pegs, we need to move all disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3 while following the rules. The classic recursive solution involves moving the top n-1 disks to an auxiliary peg, moving the nth disk to the target peg, and then moving the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\nFor 3 disks, the steps are as follows:\n\n1. Move the top 2 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1 using Peg 3 as auxiliary.\n2. Move the largest disk (disk 3) from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n3. Move the 2 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3 using Peg 2 as auxiliary.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to generate the sequence of moves.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary):\n    if n == 1:\n        print(f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n    else:\n        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)\n        print(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)\n\n# Solve the Tower of Hanoi problem for 3 disks, moving from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nhanoi(3, 2, 3, 1)\n```\n\nThis code will output the sequence of moves needed to solve the problem. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the sequence of moves to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks, moving them from Peg 2 to Peg 3. The sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n>>>"
