    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks and 4 pegs, we need to find an optimal sequence of moves that transfers all disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 while adhering to the rules. The presence of an extra peg (4 pegs instead of the traditional 3) allows for potentially fewer moves than the classic 3-peg problem.\n\nThe strategy for solving the Tower of Hanoi with 4 pegs is more complex than with 3 pegs. One approach is to use the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which involves breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems. However, for 3 disks, we can manually determine the optimal sequence of moves.\n\nLet's outline the steps:\n\n1. Move the smallest disk to an auxiliary peg.\n2. Move the second smallest disk to the destination peg.\n3. Move the smallest disk to the destination peg.\n4. Move the largest disk to an auxiliary peg.\n5. Move the smallest disk back to the original peg.\n6. Move the second smallest disk to the auxiliary peg where the largest disk is.\n7. Move the smallest disk to the destination peg.\n8. Move the largest disk to the destination peg.\n9. Move the smallest disk to an auxiliary peg.\n10. Move the second smallest disk to the destination peg.\n11. Move the smallest disk to the destination peg.\n\nNow, let's generate the sequence of moves using Python code to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [(1, source, target)]\n    \n    moves = []\n    # Move n-2 disks from source to auxiliary1 using auxiliary2 and target\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(n-2, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target)\n    # Move the (n-1)th disk to auxiliary2\n    moves.append((n-1, source, auxiliary2))\n    # Move the nth disk to target\n    moves.append((n, source, target))\n    # Move the (n-1)th disk from auxiliary2 to target\n    moves.append((n-1, auxiliary2, target))\n    # Move n-2 disks from auxiliary1 to target using source and auxiliary2\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(n-2, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2)\n    \n    return moves\n\n# Generate the sequence of moves for 3 disks and 4 pegs\nmoves = hanoi_4_pegs(3, 1, 2, 3, 4)\n# Format the moves as required\nformatted_moves = [f\"Move disk {disk} from Peg {src} to Peg {dst}\" for disk, src, dst in moves]\nprint(\"\\n\".join(formatted_moves))\n```\n\nThis code will generate the sequence of moves for transferring 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 using 4 pegs. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code output provides the sequence of moves to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks and 4 pegs. The sequence is as follows:\n\n1. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n2. Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\n3. Move disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n4. Move disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n5. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n\nThis sequence efficiently moves all disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 using the additional pegs to minimize the number of moves.\n\n<<<Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2>>>"
