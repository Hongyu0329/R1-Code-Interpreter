    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 6 disks and 4 pegs, we need to use an algorithm that efficiently utilizes the extra peg to minimize the number of moves. The classic Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 pegs has a well-known recursive solution, but with 4 pegs, the problem becomes more complex.\n\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm is a well-known approach for solving the Tower of Hanoi problem with more than 3 pegs. The algorithm involves breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems, moving a subset of disks to an auxiliary peg, moving the remaining disks directly to the target peg, and then moving the subset of disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\nLet's implement this algorithm to find the sequence of moves for 6 disks and 4 pegs, moving from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\"]\n    \n    moves = []\n    k = n - 2  # Optimal k for 6 disks and 4 pegs is 4\n    # Move k disks to auxiliary1\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(k, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target)\n    # Move remaining n-k disks to target using auxiliary2\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n-k, source, target, auxiliary2)\n    # Move k disks from auxiliary1 to target\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(k, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2)\n    \n    return moves\n\ndef hanoi_3_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\"]\n    \n    moves = []\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)\n    moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)\n    \n    return moves\n\n# Solve the problem for 6 disks, moving from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nmoves = hanoi_4_pegs(6, 3, 2, 1, 4)\nprint(\"\\n\".join(moves))\n```\n\nThis code will generate the sequence of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 6 disks and 4 pegs, moving from Peg 3 to Peg 2. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
