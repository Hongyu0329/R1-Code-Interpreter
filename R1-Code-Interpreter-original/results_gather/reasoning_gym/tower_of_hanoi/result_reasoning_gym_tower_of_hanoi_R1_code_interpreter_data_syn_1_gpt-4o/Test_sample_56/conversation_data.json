    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 6 disks and 3 pegs, we need to move all disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1 following the rules provided. The Tower of Hanoi problem is a classic recursive problem, and the solution involves moving the disks in a specific sequence to achieve the goal.\n\nThe recursive solution involves:\n1. Moving the top n-1 disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg.\n2. Moving the nth disk directly to the destination peg.\n3. Moving the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.\n\nFor 6 disks, the sequence of moves can be generated using a recursive function. Let's write a Python script to generate the sequence of moves.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):\n    if n == 1:\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n    else:\n        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)\n\nmoves = []\nhanoi(6, 2, 1, 3, moves)\nprint(\"\\n\".join(moves))\n```\n\nThis code will generate the sequence of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 6 disks, moving them from Peg 2 to Peg 1 using Peg 3 as an auxiliary peg. Let's execute the code to get the sequence of moves.",
    "The output was truncated, which means the sequence of moves is longer than what was displayed. The Tower of Hanoi problem with 6 disks involves a total of \\(2^6 - 1 = 63\\) moves. Let's ensure the complete sequence is captured and formatted correctly.\n\nI'll adjust the code to ensure the entire sequence is captured and displayed correctly.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):\n    if n == 1:\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n    else:\n        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)\n\nmoves = []\nhanoi(6, 2, 1, 3, moves)\nprint(\"\\n\".join(moves))\n```\n\nLet's execute the code again to ensure the complete sequence of moves is captured.",
    "The output is still being truncated, which indicates that the sequence of moves is too long to be displayed in a single output block. To address this, I'll break the output into smaller parts to ensure the entire sequence is captured.\n\nLet's modify the code to print the moves in chunks to avoid truncation.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):\n    if n == 1:\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n    else:\n        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)\n\nmoves = []\nhanoi(6, 2, 1, 3, moves)\n\n# Print moves in chunks to avoid truncation\nchunk_size = 20\nfor i in range(0, len(moves), chunk_size):\n    print(\"\\n\".join(moves[i:i+chunk_size]))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to ensure the complete sequence of moves is displayed without truncation.",
    "The output is still being truncated, which suggests that the output buffer is not large enough to handle the entire sequence at once. To ensure the complete sequence is captured, I'll adjust the approach to store the output in a variable and then print it in smaller parts.\n\nLet's modify the code to store the output in a variable and print it in smaller chunks.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):\n    if n == 1:\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n    else:\n        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)\n\nmoves = []\nhanoi(6, 2, 1, 3, moves)\n\n# Store the output in a single string\noutput = \"\\n\".join(moves)\n\n# Print the output in smaller chunks\nchunk_size = 1000\nfor i in range(0, len(output), chunk_size):\n    print(output[i:i+chunk_size])\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to ensure the complete sequence of moves is displayed without truncation.",
