    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 6 disks and 3 pegs, we need to follow the recursive strategy. The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems:\n\n1. Move the top \\( n-1 \\) disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg.\n2. Move the nth disk directly from the source peg to the destination peg.\n3. Move the \\( n-1 \\) disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.\n\nFor this specific problem, we need to move all disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3. Let's define the pegs as follows:\n- Source Peg: Peg 2\n- Auxiliary Peg: Peg 1\n- Destination Peg: Peg 3\n\nWe will use a recursive function to generate the sequence of moves. Let's implement this in Python to get the sequence of moves.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination, moves):\n    if n == 1:\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {destination}\")\n    else:\n        hanoi(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary, moves)\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {destination}\")\n        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination, moves)\n\nmoves = []\nhanoi(6, 2, 1, 3, moves)\nprint(\"\\n\".join(moves))\n```\n\nThis code will generate the sequence of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 6 disks, moving them from Peg 2 to Peg 3. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "It seems that the output was truncated, and there was an error in displaying the complete sequence of moves. Let's ensure that the entire sequence is generated and displayed correctly. I will re-run the code to capture the full output.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination, moves):\n    if n == 1:\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {destination}\")\n    else:\n        hanoi(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary, moves)\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {destination}\")\n        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination, moves)\n\nmoves = []\nhanoi(6, 2, 1, 3, moves)\nprint(\"\\n\".join(moves))\n```\n\nLet's execute the code again to ensure we capture the complete sequence of moves.",
    "It seems that the output is still being truncated. This is likely due to the large number of moves required for 6 disks, which is \\(2^6 - 1 = 63\\) moves. To ensure we capture the entire sequence, let's break down the process into smaller parts or ensure the output is fully captured. \n\nI'll attempt to generate the complete sequence again and ensure it is displayed correctly.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination, moves):\n    if n == 1:\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {destination}\")\n    else:\n        hanoi(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary, moves)\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {destination}\")\n        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination, moves)\n\nmoves = []\nhanoi(6, 2, 1, 3, moves)\nprint(\"\\n\".join(moves))\n```\n\nLet's execute the code again to ensure we capture the complete sequence of moves.",
    "The output is still being truncated, which suggests that the environment may have limitations on the length of output it can display at once. To address this, I will split the output into smaller parts to ensure the entire sequence is captured. Let's try a different approach to ensure we can see the complete sequence of moves.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination, moves):\n    if n == 1:\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {destination}\")\n    else:\n        hanoi(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary, moves)\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {destination}\")\n        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination, moves)\n\nmoves = []\nhanoi(6, 2, 1, 3, moves)\n\n# Print the moves in chunks to avoid truncation\nchunk_size = 20\nfor i in range(0, len(moves), chunk_size):\n    print(\"\\n\".join(moves[i:i+chunk_size]))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to ensure we capture the complete sequence of moves in smaller chunks.",
    "The output is still being truncated, which indicates that the environment may have a strict limit on the output length. To ensure we capture the entire sequence, I will modify the approach to store the output in a variable and then present it as a final answer.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination, moves):\n    if n == 1:\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {destination}\")\n    else:\n        hanoi(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary, moves)\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {destination}\")\n        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination, moves)\n\nmoves = []\nhanoi(6, 2, 1, 3, moves)\n\n# Store the moves in a single string\nresult = \"\\n\".join(moves)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to ensure we capture the complete sequence of moves in a single output."
