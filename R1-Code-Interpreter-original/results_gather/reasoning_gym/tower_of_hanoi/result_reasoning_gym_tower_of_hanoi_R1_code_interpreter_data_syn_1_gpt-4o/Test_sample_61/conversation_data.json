    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 6 disks and 4 pegs, we need to use an efficient algorithm that minimizes the number of moves. The classic Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 pegs has a well-known solution, but with 4 pegs, the problem becomes more complex.\n\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm is a well-known approach for solving the Tower of Hanoi problem with more than 3 pegs. The algorithm involves recursively moving a subset of disks to an intermediate peg, moving the remaining disks directly to the target peg, and then moving the subset from the intermediate peg to the target peg.\n\nLet's implement the Frame-Stewart algorithm to find the sequence of moves for 6 disks and 4 pegs.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [(1, source, target)]\n    \n    moves = []\n    k = n // 2  # Optimal k can be found using more complex logic, but n//2 is a simple heuristic\n    # Move k disks to auxiliary1\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(k, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target)\n    # Move n-k disks to target\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n-k, source, target, auxiliary2)\n    # Move k disks from auxiliary1 to target\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(k, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2)\n    \n    return moves\n\ndef hanoi_3_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [(1, source, target)]\n    \n    moves = []\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)\n    moves.append((n, source, target))\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)\n    \n    return moves\n\ndef format_moves(moves):\n    return [f\"Move disk {disk} from Peg {src} to Peg {tgt}\" for disk, src, tgt in moves]\n\n# Solve the problem\nmoves = hanoi_4_pegs(6, 1, 4, 2, 3)\nformatted_moves = format_moves(moves)\nfor move in formatted_moves:\n    print(move)\n```\n\nThis code will generate the sequence of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 6 disks and 4 pegs. Let's execute the code to get the sequence of moves.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided a sequence of moves to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 6 disks and 4 pegs. However, the sequence seems to be incomplete or incorrect for moving all 6 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 4. Let's review the logic and ensure that the solution is correct.\n\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm is a recursive approach that involves:\n1. Moving a subset of disks to an auxiliary peg.\n2. Moving the remaining disks directly to the target peg.\n3. Moving the subset from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\nThe code uses a simple heuristic of `k = n // 2` to determine the number of disks to move in the first step. However, this heuristic might not always yield the optimal solution. Let's adjust the code to ensure it correctly solves the problem for 6 disks and 4 pegs.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [(1, source, target)]\n    \n    moves = []\n    k = 3  # For 6 disks, the optimal k is known to be 3\n    # Move k disks to auxiliary1\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(k, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target)\n    # Move n-k disks to target\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n-k, source, target, auxiliary2)\n    # Move k disks from auxiliary1 to target\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(k, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2)\n    \n    return moves\n\ndef hanoi_3_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [(1, source, target)]\n    \n    moves = []\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)\n    moves.append((n, source, target))\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)\n    \n    return moves\n\ndef format_moves(moves):\n    return [f\"Move disk {disk} from Peg {src} to Peg {tgt}\" for disk, src, tgt in moves]\n\n# Solve the problem\nmoves = hanoi_4_pegs(6, 1, 4, 2, 3)\nformatted_moves = format_moves(moves)\nfor move in formatted_moves:\n    print(move)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code again to verify the sequence of moves.",
