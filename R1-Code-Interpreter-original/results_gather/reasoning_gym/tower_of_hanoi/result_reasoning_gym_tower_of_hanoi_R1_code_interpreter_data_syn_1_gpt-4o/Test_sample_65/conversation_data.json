    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 disks and 4 pegs, we need to use an algorithm that efficiently moves the disks from the source peg to the destination peg while adhering to the rules. The classic Tower of Hanoi problem is typically solved with 3 pegs, but with 4 pegs, we can use the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is a generalization for more than 3 pegs.\n\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm involves:\n1. Moving a subset of the largest disks to an auxiliary peg.\n2. Moving the remaining disks to the destination peg.\n3. Moving the subset of the largest disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.\n\nLet's implement this algorithm in Python to generate the sequence of moves.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [(1, source, target)]\n    \n    moves = []\n    k = n - 2  # Optimal k for 4 pegs and n disks\n    # Move k disks to auxiliary1\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(k, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target)\n    # Move remaining n-k disks to target using auxiliary2\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n-k, source, target, auxiliary2)\n    # Move k disks from auxiliary1 to target\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(k, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2)\n    return moves\n\ndef hanoi_3_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [(1, source, target)]\n    \n    moves = []\n    # Move n-1 disks to auxiliary\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)\n    # Move nth disk to target\n    moves.append((n, source, target))\n    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)\n    return moves\n\n# Generate the sequence of moves for 4 disks and 4 pegs\nmoves = hanoi_4_pegs(4, 3, 1, 2, 4)\n\n# Format the output\nformatted_moves = [f\"Move disk {disk} from Peg {src} to Peg {tgt}\" for disk, src, tgt in moves]\nprint(\"\\n\".join(formatted_moves))\n```\n\nThis code will generate the sequence of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 disks and 4 pegs, moving all disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "It seems there was an error in the code logic for solving the Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 pegs. The Frame-Stewart algorithm requires careful selection of the number of disks to move to the auxiliary peg, and the code might not have implemented this correctly.\n\nLet's revisit the algorithm and ensure that the logic for moving disks between the pegs is correctly implemented.
