    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 5 disks and 3 pegs, we need to follow a recursive approach. The goal is to move all disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2, using Peg 1 as an auxiliary peg. The recursive solution involves moving the top n-1 disks to the auxiliary peg, moving the nth disk to the target peg, and then moving the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move the top 4 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1 using Peg 2 as auxiliary.\n2. Move the 5th disk from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n3. Move the 4 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 using Peg 3 as auxiliary.\n\nWe will implement this logic in Python to generate the sequence of moves.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):\n    if n == 1:\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n    else:\n        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)\n\nmoves = []\nhanoi(5, 3, 2, 1, moves)\nprint(\"\\n\".join(moves))\n```\n\nThis code will generate the sequence of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem for 5 disks, moving them from Peg 3 to Peg 2. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
