    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks, we need to move all disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 using Peg 3 as an auxiliary peg. The rules of the game are that only one disk can be moved at a time, a larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk, and all disks must be on a peg at all times.\n\nThe Tower of Hanoi problem can be solved using a recursive algorithm. The idea is to move the top n-1 disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg, then move the nth disk to the destination peg, and finally move the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.\n\nLet's write a Python script to generate the sequence of moves for 7 disks:\n\n```python\ndef hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):\n    if n == 1:\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n    else:\n        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)\n\nmoves = []\nhanoi(7, 1, 2, 3, moves)\nprint(\"\\n\".join(moves))\n```\n\nThis script defines a recursive function `hanoi` that appends each move to a list `moves`. The function is called with the number of disks, the source peg, the target peg, and the auxiliary peg. The final sequence of moves is printed at the end. Let's execute this code to get the sequence of moves.",
    "It seems that the output was truncated, and there was an error in displaying the complete sequence of moves. Let's ensure that the entire sequence of moves is generated and displayed correctly. I'll re-run the code to provide the complete sequence of moves for solving the Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):\n    if n == 1:\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n    else:\n        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)\n\nmoves = []\nhanoi(7, 1, 2, 3, moves)\nprint(\"\\n\".join(moves))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code again to ensure the complete sequence is captured.",
    "The output is still being truncated, which suggests that the output buffer might be limited. To address this, I'll break down the solution into smaller parts and ensure that the entire sequence of moves is captured. Let's try a different approach to ensure the complete sequence is displayed.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):\n    if n == 1:\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n    else:\n        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)\n\nmoves = []\nhanoi(7, 1, 2, 3, moves)\n\n# Print the moves in chunks to avoid truncation\nchunk_size = 50\nfor i in range(0, len(moves), chunk_size):\n    print(\"\\n\".join(moves[i:i+chunk_size]))\n```\n\nThis code will print the moves in chunks to avoid truncation. Let's execute this code to get the complete sequence of moves.",
    "The output is still being truncated, which indicates that the output buffer is not sufficient to handle the entire sequence at once. To ensure that the complete sequence of moves is captured, I will store the output in a variable and then provide it as the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):\n    if n == 1:\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n    else:\n        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)\n\nmoves = []\nhanoi(7, 1, 2, 3, moves)\n\n# Store the moves in a single string\noutput = \"\\n\".join(moves)\nprint(output)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to capture the complete sequence of moves.",
