    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 6 disks and 3 pegs, we need to follow the recursive strategy. The goal is to move all disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2 using Peg 1 as an auxiliary peg. The recursive solution involves moving the top \\( n-1 \\) disks to the auxiliary peg, moving the nth disk to the target peg, and then moving the \\( n-1 \\) disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move the top 5 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1 using Peg 2 as auxiliary.\n2. Move the 6th disk from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n3. Move the 5 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 using Peg 3 as auxiliary.\n\nWe will implement this recursive solution in Python to generate the sequence of moves.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):\n    if n == 1:\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n    else:\n        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)\n\nmoves = []\nhanoi(6, 3, 2, 1, moves)\nprint(\"\\n\".join(moves))\n```\n\nThis code will generate the sequence of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem for 6 disks, moving them from Peg 3 to Peg 2. Let's execute the code to get the sequence.",
    "It seems the output was truncated, and there was an error in displaying the complete sequence of moves. Let's ensure that the entire sequence is generated correctly by re-running the code and capturing the full output.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):\n    if n == 1:\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n    else:\n        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)\n\nmoves = []\nhanoi(6, 3, 2, 1, moves)\nprint(\"\\n\".join(moves))\n```\n\nLet's execute the code again to ensure we capture the complete sequence of moves.",
    "It seems the output is still being truncated. This might be due to the large number of moves required for 6 disks, which is \\(2^6 - 1 = 63\\) moves. Let's ensure that the output is captured completely by breaking it into smaller parts if necessary.\n\nI'll attempt to provide the complete sequence of moves in a more controlled manner.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):\n    if n == 1:\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n    else:\n        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)\n\nmoves = []\nhanoi(6, 3, 2, 1, moves)\nfor move in moves:\n    print(move)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to ensure we capture the complete sequence of moves.",
    "It seems the output is still being truncated, which might be due to the limitations of the current environment. However, I can provide the complete sequence of moves for the Tower of Hanoi problem with 6 disks manually, based on the recursive logic.\n\nThe sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n```\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 6 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n```\n\nThis sequence represents the complete solution to the problem. \n\n<<<Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 6 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2>>>"
