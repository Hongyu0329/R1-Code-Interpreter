    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 disks and 4 pegs, we need to use an algorithm that efficiently moves the disks from the source peg to the target peg while utilizing the additional pegs to minimize the number of moves. The classic Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 pegs has a well-known recursive solution, but with 4 pegs, the problem becomes more complex.\n\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm is a well-known approach for solving the Tower of Hanoi problem with more than 3 pegs. It involves breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and using the additional pegs to reduce the number of moves.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Move the top k disks to an auxiliary peg using all pegs.\n2. Move the remaining disks directly to the target peg.\n3. Move the k disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the sequence of moves.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\"]\n    \n    moves = []\n    k = n - 2  # Optimal k for 4 pegs and n disks\n    # Step 1: Move top k disks to auxiliary1\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(k, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target)\n    # Step 2: Move remaining disks to target\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n - k, source, target, auxiliary2)\n    # Step 3: Move k disks from auxiliary1 to target\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(k, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2)\n    \n    return moves\n\ndef hanoi_3_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\"]\n    \n    moves = []\n    # Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n - 1, source, auxiliary, target)\n    # Move nth disk from source to target\n    moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n - 1, auxiliary, target, source)\n    \n    return moves\n\n# Solve the problem for 4 disks, moving from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nmoves = hanoi_4_pegs(4, 3, 2, 1, 4)\nfor move in moves:\n    print(move)\n```\n\nThis code will generate the sequence of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 disks and 4 pegs, moving the disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2. Let's execute the code to get the sequence of moves.",
