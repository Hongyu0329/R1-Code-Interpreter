    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks and 3 pegs, we need to move all disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1 following the rules provided. The classic recursive solution involves moving the top n-1 disks to an auxiliary peg, moving the nth disk to the target peg, and then moving the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\nLet's break down the steps for 3 disks:\n\n1. Move the top 2 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2 using Peg 1 as auxiliary.\n2. Move the largest disk (disk 3) from Peg 3 to Peg 1.\n3. Move the 2 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1 using Peg 3 as auxiliary.\n\nI will write a Python script to generate the sequence of moves for this problem.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):\n    if n == 1:\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n    else:\n        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)\n\nmoves = []\nhanoi(3, 3, 1, 2, moves)\nfor move in moves:\n    print(move)\n```\n\nThis code will generate the sequence of moves needed to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem for 3 disks, moving them from Peg 3 to Peg 1. Let's execute the code to get the sequence of moves.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the correct sequence of moves to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks, moving them from Peg 3 to Peg 1. Here is the sequence of moves:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n>>>"
