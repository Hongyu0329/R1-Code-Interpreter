    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks, we need to move all disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1 using Peg 3 as an auxiliary peg. The Tower of Hanoi problem is a classic recursive problem, and the solution involves moving smaller subsets of disks recursively.\n\nThe recursive solution can be broken down as follows:\n1. Move the top n-1 disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg.\n2. Move the nth disk from the source peg to the destination peg.\n3. Move the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.\n\nFor 7 disks, the sequence of moves can be generated using a recursive function. Let's write a Python script to generate the sequence of moves:\n\n```python\ndef hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):\n    if n == 1:\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n    else:\n        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)\n\nmoves = []\nhanoi(7, 2, 1, 3, moves)\nprint(\"\\n\".join(moves))\n```\n\nThis code will generate the sequence of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks, moving them from Peg 2 to Peg 1 using Peg 3 as an auxiliary peg. Let's execute the code to get the sequence of moves.",
    "The code executed successfully and generated the sequence of moves for solving the Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks. However, the output was truncated due to the length of the sequence. The complete sequence of moves is necessary to fully solve the problem.\n\nTo ensure the entire sequence is captured, let's re-run the code and ensure the output is complete. Here is the complete sequence of moves:\n\n```python\ndef hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):\n    if n == 1:\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n    else:\n        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)\n\nmoves = []\nhanoi(7, 2, 1, 3, moves)\nprint(\"\\n\".join(moves))\n```\n\nLet's execute the code again to ensure we capture the full sequence of moves.",
    "It seems the output is being truncated again due to the length of the sequence. The Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks involves a total of \\(2^7 - 1 = 127\\) moves, which is a lengthy sequence.\n\nTo ensure the complete sequence is captured, I will provide the sequence in a more concise format.
