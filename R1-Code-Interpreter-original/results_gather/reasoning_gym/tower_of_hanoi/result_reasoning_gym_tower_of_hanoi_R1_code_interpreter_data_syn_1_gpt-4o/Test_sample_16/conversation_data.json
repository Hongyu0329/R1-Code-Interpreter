    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks and 4 pegs, we need to use an efficient algorithm that minimizes the number of moves. The classic Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 pegs has a well-known solution, but with 4 pegs, the problem becomes more complex. \n\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm is a well-known approach for solving the Tower of Hanoi problem with more than 3 pegs. The algorithm involves breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and using an optimal strategy to move the disks.\n\nHere's the general idea of the Frame-Stewart algorithm for 4 pegs:\n1. Move the top k disks to an auxiliary peg using all pegs.\n2. Move the remaining n-k disks directly to the target peg using the classic 3-peg solution.\n3. Move the k disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg using all pegs.\n\nThe challenge is to find the optimal value of k that minimizes the total number of moves. For 7 disks and 4 pegs, we can use this approach to find the sequence of moves.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the sequence of moves:\n\n```python\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [(1, source, target)]\n    \n    # Find the optimal k\n    min_moves = float('inf')\n    best_k = 0\n    for k in range(1, n):\n        moves = 2 * hanoi_4_pegs(k, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target) + hanoi_3_pegs(n-k, source, target, auxiliary1)\n        if len(moves) < min_moves:\n            min_moves = len(moves)\n            best_k = k\n    \n    # Move the top best_k disks to auxiliary1\n    moves = hanoi_4_pegs(best_k, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target)\n    # Move the remaining n-best_k disks to target\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n-best_k, source, target, auxiliary2)\n    # Move the best_k disks from auxiliary1 to target\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(best_k, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2)\n    \n    return moves\n\ndef hanoi_3_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [(1, source, target)]\n    \n    moves = hanoi_3_pegs(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)\n    moves.append((n, source, target))\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)\n    \n    return moves\n\ndef format_moves(moves):\n    return [f\"Move disk {disk} from Peg {src} to Peg {tgt}\" for disk, src, tgt in moves]\n\n# Solve the problem\nmoves = hanoi_4_pegs(7, 2, 3, 1, 4)\nformatted_moves = format_moves(moves)\nprint(\"\\n\".join(formatted_moves))\n```\n\nThis code will generate the sequence of moves for solving the Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks and 4 pegs, moving the disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
