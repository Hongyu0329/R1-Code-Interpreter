    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks and 3 pegs, we need to move all disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2 while following the rules. The classic approach involves using a recursive strategy to break down the problem into smaller subproblems.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Move the top 2 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1, using Peg 2 as an auxiliary peg.\n2. Move the largest disk (disk 3) from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n3. Move the 2 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2, using Peg 3 as an auxiliary peg.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to generate the sequence of moves:\n\n```python\ndef hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):\n    if n == 1:\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n    else:\n        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)\n\nmoves = []\nhanoi(3, 3, 2, 1, moves)\nfor move in moves:\n    print(move)\n```\n\nThis code will generate the sequence of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks, moving them from Peg 3 to Peg 2. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the sequence of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks, moving them from Peg 3 to Peg 2. Here is the sequence of moves:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n>>>"
