    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 5 disks and 3 pegs, we need to follow a recursive approach. The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, where we move the top n-1 disks to an auxiliary peg, move the nth disk to the target peg, and then move the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Move the top 4 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3 using Peg 2 as auxiliary.\n2. Move the 5th disk from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n3. Move the 4 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2 using Peg 1 as auxiliary.\n\nThis recursive approach can be implemented using a function that prints the sequence of moves. Let's write a Python script to generate the sequence of moves for 5 disks.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary):\n    if n == 1:\n        print(f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n    else:\n        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)\n        print(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)\n\n# Solve the Tower of Hanoi problem for 5 disks\nhanoi(5, 1, 2, 3)\n```\n\nThis code will output the sequence of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 5 disks. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the sequence of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 5 disks. The output is the correct sequence of moves to transfer all disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 using Peg 3 as an auxiliary peg.\n\nHere is the sequence of moves:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n>>>"
