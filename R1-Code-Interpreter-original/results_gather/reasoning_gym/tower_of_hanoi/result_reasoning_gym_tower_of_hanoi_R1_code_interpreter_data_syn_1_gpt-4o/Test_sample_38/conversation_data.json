    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks and 4 pegs, we need to find an optimal sequence of moves that transfers all disks from Peg 4 to Peg 2. The presence of an extra peg allows for potentially fewer moves than the classic 3-peg problem.\n\nThe strategy for solving the Tower of Hanoi with more than three pegs involves using the extra peg(s) to temporarily hold disks, which can reduce the total number of moves. The Frame-Stewart algorithm is a well-known method for solving the Tower of Hanoi problem with more than three pegs. It involves recursively solving smaller subproblems.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. Move the top two disks to an auxiliary peg (Peg 1 or Peg 3).\n2. Move the largest disk directly to the destination peg (Peg 2).\n3. Move the two disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg (Peg 2).\n\nLet's implement this strategy in Python to generate the sequence of moves.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [(1, source, target)]\n    \n    # Move n-2 disks from source to auxiliary1 using auxiliary2 and target\n    moves = hanoi_4_pegs(n-2, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target)\n    \n    # Move the (n-1)th disk to auxiliary2\n    moves.append((n-1, source, auxiliary2))\n    \n    # Move the nth disk to target\n    moves.append((n, source, target))\n    \n    # Move the (n-1)th disk from auxiliary2 to target\n    moves.append((n-1, auxiliary2, target))\n    \n    # Move n-2 disks from auxiliary1 to target using source and auxiliary2\n    moves.extend(hanoi_4_pegs(n-2, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2))\n    \n    return moves\n\n# Generate the sequence of moves for 3 disks from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nmoves = hanoi_4_pegs(3, 4, 2, 1, 3)\n\n# Format the moves as required\nformatted_moves = [f\"Move disk {disk} from Peg {src} to Peg {dst}\" for disk, src, dst in moves]\n\n# Print the formatted moves\nfor move in formatted_moves:\n    print(move)\n```\n\nThis code will generate the sequence of moves for transferring 3 disks from Peg 4 to Peg 2 using 4 pegs. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
