    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks and 4 pegs, we need to use an efficient algorithm that minimizes the number of moves. The classic Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 pegs has a well-known solution, but with 4 pegs, the problem becomes more complex. \n\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm is a well-known approach for solving the Tower of Hanoi problem with more than 3 pegs. The algorithm involves recursively moving a subset of disks to an intermediate peg, moving the remaining disks directly to the target peg, and then moving the subset from the intermediate peg to the target peg.\n\nLet's implement the Frame-Stewart algorithm to find the sequence of moves for 7 disks and 4 pegs, moving from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\"]\n    \n    moves = []\n    k = n - 1  # Optimal k for 7 disks and 4 pegs is 4\n    # Move k disks to auxiliary1\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(k, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target)\n    # Move remaining n-k disks to target\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n-k, source, target, auxiliary2)\n    # Move k disks from auxiliary1 to target\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(k, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2)\n    return moves\n\ndef hanoi_3_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\"]\n    \n    moves = []\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)\n    moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)\n    return moves\n\n# Solve the problem for 7 disks, moving from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nmoves = hanoi_4_pegs(7, 2, 3, 1, 4)\nprint(\"\\n\".join(moves))\n```\n\nThis code will generate the sequence of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks and 4 pegs, moving from Peg 2 to Peg 3. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "It seems there was an error in the code logic, particularly in the way the moves are being generated. The output is incorrect because it repeatedly moves \"disk 1\" without considering the actual disk numbers. This indicates a problem in the recursive logic or the way the moves are being constructed.\n\nLet's revisit the logic and correct the implementation. The Frame-Stewart algorithm should correctly handle the movement of disks by considering the optimal number of disks to move to an auxiliary peg before moving the rest directly to the target peg.\n\nI'll correct the code and ensure it generates the correct sequence of moves for 7 disks and 4 pegs.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\"]\n    \n    moves = []\n    k = 4  # Optimal k for 7 disks and 4 pegs is 4\n    # Move k disks to auxiliary1\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(k, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target)\n    # Move remaining n-k disks to target\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n-k, source, target, auxiliary2)\n    # Move k disks from auxiliary1 to target\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(k, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2)\n    return moves\n\ndef hanoi_3_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\"]\n    \n    moves = []\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)\n    moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)\n    return moves\n\n# Solve the problem for 7 disks, moving from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nmoves = hanoi_4_pegs(7, 2, 3, 1, 4)\nprint(\"\\n\".join(moves))\n```\n\nLet's execute the corrected code to get the proper sequence of moves.",
    "The error indicates that there is a recursion issue in the `hanoi_4_pegs` function, likely due to incorrect handling of the base case or the recursive calls. The recursion is not terminating properly, leading to a stack overflow.\n\nTo address this, let's ensure that the recursive logic is correctly implemented. The Frame-Stewart algorithm should be carefully applied to ensure that the disks are moved optimally between the pegs.

This is likely due to the incorrect handling of the recursive calls in the `hanoi_4_pegs` function.
