    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 5 disks and 3 pegs, we need to move all disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1 while following the rules. The Tower of Hanoi problem is a classic recursive problem, and the solution involves moving the disks between pegs in a specific sequence.\n\nThe recursive solution involves:\n1. Moving the top n-1 disks from the source peg to an auxiliary peg.\n2. Moving the nth disk directly to the destination peg.\n3. Moving the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.\n\nLet's write a Python script to generate the sequence of moves for this problem.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):\n    if n == 1:\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n    else:\n        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)\n\nmoves = []\nhanoi(5, 2, 1, 3, moves)\nfor move in moves:\n    print(move)\n```\n\nThis script will generate the sequence of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 5 disks, moving them from Peg 2 to Peg 1. Let's execute the code to get the sequence of moves.",
