    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 6 disks and 4 pegs, we need to use an efficient algorithm that minimizes the number of moves. The classic Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 pegs has a well-known recursive solution, but with 4 pegs, the problem becomes more complex.\n\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm is a well-known approach for solving the Tower of Hanoi problem with more than 3 pegs. The algorithm involves breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and using an optimal strategy to move the disks.\n\nHere's the reasoning process:\n\n1. **Identify the number of disks (n) and pegs (k):** We have 6 disks and 4 pegs.\n2. **Use the Frame-Stewart algorithm:** This involves choosing an intermediate peg and recursively solving smaller subproblems.\n3. **Recursive breakdown:** \n   - Move the top `m` disks to an intermediate peg using all pegs.\n   - Move the remaining `n-m` disks directly to the destination peg using the remaining pegs.\n   - Move the `m` disks from the intermediate peg to the destination peg.\n\nThe challenge is to determine the optimal `m` that minimizes the total number of moves. For 6 disks and 4 pegs, the Frame-Stewart algorithm provides a systematic way to find the sequence of moves.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to generate the sequence of moves:\n\n```python\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [(1, source, target)]\n    \n    moves = []\n    # Find the optimal number of disks to move in the first step\n    m = n // 2  # A heuristic choice for m\n    # Move m disks to auxiliary1 using all pegs\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(m, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target)\n    # Move the remaining n-m disks directly to target using auxiliary2\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n - m, source, target, auxiliary2)\n    # Move m disks from auxiliary1 to target using all pegs\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(m, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2)\n    \n    return moves\n\ndef hanoi_3_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [(1, source, target)]\n    \n    moves = []\n    # Move n-1 disks to auxiliary\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n - 1, source, auxiliary, target)\n    # Move the nth disk to target\n    moves.append((n, source, target))\n    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n - 1, auxiliary, target, source)\n    \n    return moves\n\n# Generate the sequence of moves for 6 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nmoves = hanoi_4_pegs(6, 2, 1, 3, 4)\n\n# Format the output\nformatted_moves = [f\"Move disk {disk} from Peg {src} to Peg {dst}\" for disk, src, dst in moves]\nprint(\"\\n\".join(formatted_moves))\n```\n\nThis code will generate the sequence of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 6 disks and 4 pegs, moving the disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "It seems there was an error in the code execution, likely due to the complexity of the Frame-Stewart algorithm implementation. Let's refine the approach to ensure the correct sequence of moves is generated for the Tower of Hanoi problem with 6 disks and 4 pegs.\n\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm involves choosing an optimal number of disks `m` to move to an intermediate peg, solving the subproblems recursively, and then moving the remaining disks. The choice of `m` is crucial and can be determined through experimentation or known optimal values for specific cases.\n\nLet's correct the implementation and ensure it generates the correct sequence of moves:\n\n```python\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [(1, source, target)]\n    \n    moves = []\n    # Optimal choice of m for 6 disks and 4 pegs is known to be 3\n    m = 3\n    # Move m disks to auxiliary1 using all pegs\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(m, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target)\n    # Move the remaining n-m disks directly to target using auxiliary2\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n - m, source, target, auxiliary2)\n    # Move m disks from auxiliary1 to target using all pegs\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(m, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2)\n    \n    return moves\n\ndef hanoi_3_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [(1, source, target)]\n    \n    moves = []\n    # Move n-1 disks to auxiliary\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n - 1, source, auxiliary, target)\n    # Move the nth disk to target\n    moves.append((n, source, target))\n    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n - 1, auxiliary, target, source)\n    \n    return moves\n\n# Generate the sequence of moves for 6 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nmoves = hanoi_4_pegs(6, 2, 1, 3, 4)\n\n# Format the output\nformatted_moves = [f\"Move disk {disk} from Peg {src} to Peg {dst}\" for disk, src, dst in moves]\nprint(\"\\n\".join(formatted_moves))\n```\n\nThis code should correctly implement the Frame-Stewart algorithm for 6 disks and 4 pegs, using the known optimal `m` value for this specific case.
