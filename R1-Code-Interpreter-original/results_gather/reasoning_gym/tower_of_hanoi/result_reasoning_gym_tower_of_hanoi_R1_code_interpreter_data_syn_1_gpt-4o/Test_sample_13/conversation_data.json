    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 5 disks and 4 pegs, we need to use an efficient algorithm that minimizes the number of moves. The classic Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 pegs has a well-known recursive solution, but with 4 pegs, the problem becomes more complex.\n\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm is a well-known approach for solving the Tower of Hanoi problem with more than 3 pegs. The algorithm involves breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and using an additional peg to reduce the number of moves.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Move the top k disks to an auxiliary peg.\n2. Move the remaining disks to the destination peg.\n3. Move the k disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.\n\nThe challenge is to determine the optimal value of k that minimizes the total number of moves. For 5 disks and 4 pegs, we can use a recursive approach to find the sequence of moves.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the sequence of moves.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\"]\n    \n    moves = []\n    k = n - 2  # Optimal k for 5 disks and 4 pegs is 3 (n-2)\n    \n    # Step 1: Move top k disks to auxiliary1\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(k, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target)\n    \n    # Step 2: Move remaining disks to target\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(n - k, source, target, auxiliary2, auxiliary1)\n    \n    # Step 3: Move k disks from auxiliary1 to target\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(k, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2)\n    \n    return moves\n\n# Solve the problem for 5 disks, moving from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nmoves = hanoi_4_pegs(5, 4, 2, 1, 3)\nprint(\"\\n\".join(moves))\n```\n\nThis code will generate the sequence of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 5 disks and 4 pegs, moving from Peg 4 to Peg 2. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The error indicates that there is an issue with the recursive calls in the `hanoi_4_pegs` function. Specifically, the recursion is not terminating correctly, likely due to an incorrect choice of `k` or the recursive structure.\n\nTo solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 pegs, we need to carefully choose the number of disks to move in each step. The Frame-Stewart algorithm suggests using a dynamic approach to determine the optimal number of disks to move to the auxiliary peg.\n\nLet's correct the approach by ensuring the recursive calls are properly structured and the base cases are correctly defined. We will also ensure that the choice of `k` is appropriate for minimizing the number of moves.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\"]\n    \n    moves = []\n    k = n - 2  # For 5 disks, a common choice is to move 3 disks first\n    \n    # Step 1: Move top k disks to auxiliary1\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(k, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target)\n    \n    # Step 2: Move remaining disks to target\n    moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n    \n    # Step 3: Move k disks from auxiliary1 to target\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(k, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2)\n    \n    return moves\n\n# Solve the problem for 5 disks, moving from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nmoves = hanoi_4_pegs(5, 4, 2, 1, 3)\nprint(\"\\n\".join(moves))\n```\n\nThis code should correctly generate the sequence of moves for the Tower of Hanoi problem with 5 disks and 4 pegs. Let's execute the code to verify the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided a sequence of moves. However, the sequence is incomplete and incorrect for moving all 5 disks from Peg 4 to Peg 2 using 4 pegs. The Frame-Stewart algorithm requires a more sophisticated approach to determine the optimal number of disks to move to the auxiliary peg.\n\nLet's refine the approach by using a more accurate method to determine the optimal number of disks to move in each step. We will use a recursive strategy to ensure that the sequence of moves is correct and complete.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\"]\n    \n    moves = []\n    # Determine the optimal number of disks to move to the auxiliary peg\n    k = n - 1  # Start with n-1 and adjust if necessary\n    \n    # Step 1: Move top k disks to auxiliary1\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(k, source, auxiliary1, target, auxiliary2)\n    \n    # Step 2: Move remaining disks to target\n    moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n    \n    # Step 3: Move k disks from auxiliary1 to target\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(k, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2)\n    \n    return moves\n\n# Solve the problem for 5 disks, moving from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nmoves = hanoi_4_pegs(5, 4, 2, 1, 3)\nprint(\"\\n\".join(moves))\n```\n\nThis code should provide a more accurate sequence of moves for the Tower of Hanoi problem with 5 disks and 4 pegs. Let's execute the code to verify the result.",
