    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 disks and 3 pegs, we need to follow the rules and move the disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3. The classic recursive solution involves moving the top n-1 disks to an auxiliary peg, moving the nth disk to the target peg, and then moving the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning for solving the problem:\n\n1. Move the top 3 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1 using Peg 3 as auxiliary.\n2. Move the 4th disk from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n3. Move the 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3 using Peg 2 as auxiliary.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to generate the sequence of moves:\n\n```python\ndef hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):\n    if n == 1:\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n    else:\n        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)\n\nmoves = []\nhanoi(4, 2, 3, 1, moves)\nprint(\"\\n\".join(moves))\n```\n\nThis code will generate the sequence of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 disks, moving them from Peg 2 to Peg 3. Let's execute the code to get the result.",

There were no errors in the execution.\n\nThe sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n>>>"
