    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks, we need to move all disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3 using Peg 1 as an auxiliary peg. The rules of the game must be followed, which means we can only move one disk at a time, and a larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.\n\nThe Tower of Hanoi problem can be solved using a recursive algorithm. The idea is to move the top n-1 disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg, then move the nth disk to the destination peg, and finally move the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to generate the sequence of moves.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):\n    if n == 1:\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n    else:\n        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)\n\nmoves = []\nhanoi(7, 2, 3, 1, moves)\nprint(\"\\n\".join(moves))\n```\n\nThis code will generate the sequence of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks, moving them from Peg 2 to Peg 3. Let's execute the code to get the sequence of moves.",
    "The code executed successfully and generated the sequence of moves for solving the Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks. However, the output was truncated due to the length of the sequence. Let's ensure the complete sequence is captured and formatted correctly.\n\nThe sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 6 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 7 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 6 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n>>>\n"
