    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks and 4 pegs, we need to use an efficient algorithm that minimizes the number of moves. The classic Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 pegs has a well-known solution, but with 4 pegs, the problem becomes more complex.\n\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm is a well-known approach for solving the Tower of Hanoi problem with more than 3 pegs. The algorithm involves recursively breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems, moving a subset of disks to an intermediate peg, and then moving the remaining disks directly to the target peg.\n\nLet's implement the Frame-Stewart algorithm to find the sequence of moves for 7 disks and 4 pegs, moving all disks from Peg 3 to Peg 4.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\"]\n    \n    # Find the optimal number of disks to move to the auxiliary peg\n    k = n // 2\n    \n    # Move k disks to auxiliary1\n    moves = hanoi_4_pegs(k, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target)\n    \n    # Move the remaining n-k disks directly to the target\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n - k, source, target, auxiliary2)\n    \n    # Move k disks from auxiliary1 to target\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(k, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2)\n    \n    return moves\n\ndef hanoi_3_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\"]\n    \n    moves = hanoi_3_pegs(n - 1, source, auxiliary, target)\n    moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n - 1, auxiliary, target, source)\n    \n    return moves\n\n# Solve the problem for 7 disks, moving from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nmoves = hanoi_4_pegs(7, 3, 4, 1, 2)\nprint(\"\\n\".join(moves))\n```\n\nThis code will generate the sequence of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks and 4 pegs, moving all disks from Peg 3 to Peg 4. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "It seems there was an error in the approach or the code logic, as the output does not cover the complete solution for moving 7 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 4 using 4 pegs. The Frame-Stewart algorithm is complex, and the implementation might not have been optimal or correct for this specific case.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the approach and ensure the correct implementation of the Frame-Stewart algorithm for 4 pegs.
