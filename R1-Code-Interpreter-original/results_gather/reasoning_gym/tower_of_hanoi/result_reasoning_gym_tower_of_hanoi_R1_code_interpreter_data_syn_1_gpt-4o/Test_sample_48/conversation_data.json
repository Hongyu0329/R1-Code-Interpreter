    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 5 disks and 4 pegs, we need to use an algorithm that efficiently utilizes the extra peg to minimize the number of moves. The classic Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 pegs has a well-known recursive solution, but with 4 pegs, the problem becomes more complex.\n\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm is a well-known approach for solving the Tower of Hanoi problem with more than three pegs. It involves breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and using the extra peg to reduce the total number of moves.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Move the top k disks to an auxiliary peg using all pegs.\n2. Move the remaining disks directly to the destination peg.\n3. Move the k disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.\n\nThe challenge is to determine the optimal value of k, which minimizes the total number of moves. For 5 disks and 4 pegs, we can use a known solution or compute it using the Frame-Stewart algorithm.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the sequence of moves.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [(1, source, target)]\n    \n    # Find the optimal k\n    k = n - 2\n    moves = []\n    \n    # Move top k disks to auxiliary1\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(k, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target)\n    \n    # Move remaining disks to target\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n - k, source, target, auxiliary2)\n    \n    # Move k disks from auxiliary1 to target\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(k, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2)\n    \n    return moves\n\ndef hanoi_3_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [(1, source, target)]\n    \n    moves = []\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n - 1, source, auxiliary, target)\n    moves.append((n, source, target))\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n - 1, auxiliary, target, source)\n    \n    return moves\n\n# Get the sequence of moves\nmoves = hanoi_4_pegs(5, 4, 2, 1, 3)\n\n# Format the moves\nformatted_moves = [f\"Move disk {disk} from Peg {src} to Peg {dst}\" for disk, src, dst in moves]\n\n# Print the formatted moves\nfor move in formatted_moves:\n    print(move)\n```\n\nThis code will generate the sequence of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 5 disks and 4 pegs, moving all disks from Peg 4 to Peg 2. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code output indicates that the sequence of moves was generated, but there seems to be an error in the logic or implementation of the Frame-Stewart algorithm for 4 pegs. The sequence of moves does not correctly solve the problem as intended. Let's revisit the logic and ensure that the algorithm is correctly implemented.\n\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm involves:\n1. Moving the top k disks to an auxiliary peg.\n2. Moving the remaining disks directly to the target peg.\n3. Moving the k disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\nThe choice of k is crucial and should be optimized for the minimum number of moves. For 5 disks and 4 pegs, a common choice is to move 3 disks to an auxiliary peg, then move the remaining 2 disks directly to the target peg, and finally move the 3 disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\nLet's correct the implementation and re-run the code:\n\n```python\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [(1, source, target)]\n    \n    # Optimal k for 5 disks and 4 pegs is 3\n    k = 3\n    moves = []\n    \n    # Move top k disks to auxiliary1\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(k, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target)\n    \n    # Move remaining disks to target\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n - k, source, target, auxiliary2)\n    \n    # Move k disks from auxiliary1 to target\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(k, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2)\n    \n    return moves\n\ndef hanoi_3_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [(1, source, target)]\n    \n    moves = []\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n - 1, source, auxiliary, target)\n    moves.append((n, source, target))\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n - 1, auxiliary, target, source)\n    \n    return moves\n\n# Get the sequence of moves\nmoves = hanoi_4_pegs(5, 4, 2, 1, 3)\n\n# Format the moves\nformatted_moves = [f\"Move disk {disk} from Peg {src} to Peg {dst}\" for disk, src, dst in moves]\n\n# Print the formatted moves\nfor move in formatted_moves:\n    print(move)\n```\n\nThis revised code should correctly implement the Frame-Stewart algorithm for 5 disks and 4 pegs. Let's execute the code to verify the solution.",
    "The error indicates a recursion issue, likely due to incorrect handling of the recursive calls in the `hanoi_4_pegs` function.
