    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks and 4 pegs, we need to find an optimal sequence of moves that transfers all disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 while adhering to the rules. The presence of an extra peg (4 pegs instead of the traditional 3) allows for potentially fewer moves than the classic 3-peg problem.\n\nThe strategy for solving the 4-peg Tower of Hanoi problem involves using the extra peg to temporarily hold disks, which can reduce the number of moves required. The Frame-Stewart algorithm is a well-known approach for solving the 4-peg problem, but for 3 disks, we can manually determine the optimal sequence.\n\nLet's outline the steps:\n\n1. Move the smallest disk to an auxiliary peg.\n2. Move the second smallest disk to the destination peg.\n3. Move the smallest disk on top of the second smallest disk.\n4. Move the largest disk directly to the destination peg.\n5. Move the smallest disk to an auxiliary peg.\n6. Move the second smallest disk on top of the largest disk.\n7. Move the smallest disk on top of the second smallest disk.\n\nNow, let's generate the sequence of moves using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [(1, source, target)]\n    if n == 2:\n        return [(1, source, auxiliary1), (2, source, target), (1, auxiliary1, target)]\n    \n    moves = []\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(n-2, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target)\n    moves.append((n-1, source, auxiliary2))\n    moves.append((n, source, target))\n    moves.append((n-1, auxiliary2, target))\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(n-2, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2)\n    return moves\n\n# Generate the sequence of moves for 3 disks and 4 pegs\nmoves = hanoi_4_pegs(3, 1, 2, 3, 4)\n\n# Format the output\nformatted_moves = [f\"Move disk {disk} from Peg {src} to Peg {dst}\" for disk, src, dst in moves]\nprint(\"\\n\".join(formatted_moves))\n```\n\nThe code will generate the sequence of moves for transferring 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 using 4 pegs. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the sequence of moves to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks and 4 pegs. The sequence is optimal and adheres to the rules of the problem.\n\nHere is the final answer:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n>>>"
