    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 disks and 4 pegs, we need to consider the rules and constraints. The classic Tower of Hanoi problem is typically solved with 3 pegs, but with 4 pegs, we can use the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is a generalization for more than 3 pegs.\n\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm involves:\n1. Moving a subset of the largest disks to an auxiliary peg.\n2. Moving the remaining disks to the destination peg.\n3. Moving the subset of the largest disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.\n\nFor 4 disks and 4 pegs, the optimal strategy involves:\n- Moving the top 2 disks to an auxiliary peg.\n- Moving the remaining 2 disks to the destination peg.\n- Moving the top 2 disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.\n\nLet's implement this strategy in Python to generate the sequence of moves.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\"]\n    \n    moves = []\n    k = n - 2  # Optimal number of disks to move to auxiliary peg\n    # Move top k disks to auxiliary1\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(k, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target)\n    # Move remaining n-k disks to target\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n-k, source, target, auxiliary2)\n    # Move k disks from auxiliary1 to target\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(k, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2)\n    \n    return moves\n\ndef hanoi_3_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\"]\n    \n    moves = []\n    # Move top n-1 disks to auxiliary\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)\n    # Move nth disk to target\n    moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)\n    \n    return moves\n\n# Generate the sequence of moves for 4 disks and 4 pegs\nmoves = hanoi_4_pegs(4, 4, 1, 2, 3)\nprint(\"\\n\".join(moves))\n```\n\nThis code will generate the sequence of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 disks and 4 pegs, moving all disks from Peg 4 to Peg 1.

    "It seems there was an error in the logic of the code for solving the Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 pegs. The Frame-Stewart algorithm requires careful selection of the number of disks to move to the auxiliary peg, and the code might not have implemented this correctly.\n\nLet's revisit the logic and correct the implementation. The key is to determine the optimal number of disks to move to the auxiliary peg, which is not necessarily `n-2`. We need to find the optimal `k` that minimizes the number of moves.\n\nHere's a revised approach:\n\n1. Move the top `k` disks to an auxiliary peg.\n2.
