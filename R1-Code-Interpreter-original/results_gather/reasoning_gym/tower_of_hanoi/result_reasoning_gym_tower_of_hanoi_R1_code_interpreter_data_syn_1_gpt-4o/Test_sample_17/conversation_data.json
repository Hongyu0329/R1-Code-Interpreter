    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks and 4 pegs, we need to find an optimal sequence of moves that transfers all disks from Peg 4 to Peg 1, following the rules provided. The classic Tower of Hanoi problem is typically solved with 3 pegs, but with 4 pegs, we can potentially reduce the number of moves required.\n\nThe strategy for solving the Tower of Hanoi with 4 pegs involves using the extra peg to temporarily hold disks, allowing for more efficient movement. The Frame-Stewart algorithm is a well-known method for solving the Tower of Hanoi problem with more than 3 pegs.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Move the top k disks to an auxiliary peg.\n2. Move the remaining disks to the destination peg.\n3. Move the k disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.\n\nFor 3 disks and 4 pegs, the optimal solution involves moving 1 disk to an auxiliary peg, then moving the remaining 2 disks directly to the destination peg, and finally moving the 1 disk from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to generate the sequence of moves.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [(1, source, target)]\n    \n    # Move top 1 disk to auxiliary1\n    moves = hanoi_4_pegs(1, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target)\n    # Move remaining 2 disks to target using auxiliary2\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n-1, source, target, auxiliary2)\n    # Move 1 disk from auxiliary1 to target\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(1, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2)\n    \n    return moves\n\ndef hanoi_3_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [(1, source, target)]\n    \n    moves = hanoi_3_pegs(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)\n    moves.append((n, source, target))\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)\n    \n    return moves\n\n# Generate the sequence of moves\nmoves = hanoi_4_pegs(3, 4, 1, 2, 3)\n\n# Format the output\nformatted_moves = [f\"Move disk {disk} from Peg {src} to Peg {dst}\" for disk, src, dst in moves]\nprint(\"\\n\".join(formatted_moves))\n```\n\nThis code will generate the sequence of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks and 4 pegs, moving all disks from Peg 4 to Peg 1.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the sequence of moves to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks and 4 pegs. The sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n1. Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n2. Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\n3. Move disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n4. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n5. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n\nThis sequence efficiently moves all disks from Peg 4 to Peg 1 using the additional pegs to minimize the number of moves.\n\n<<<Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1>>>"
