    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks and 4 pegs, we need to find an optimal sequence of moves that transfers all disks from Peg 1 to Peg 4. The challenge is to utilize the additional peg to potentially reduce the number of moves compared to the classic 3-peg problem.\n\nThe strategy for solving the 4-peg Tower of Hanoi problem is more complex than the 3-peg version. One efficient approach is the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which involves breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems. However, for 3 disks, we can manually determine the sequence of moves by leveraging the extra peg to temporarily hold disks.\n\nLet's outline the steps:\n\n1. Move the smallest disk to an auxiliary peg.\n2. Move the second smallest disk to another auxiliary peg.\n3. Move the smallest disk on top of the second smallest disk.\n4. Move the largest disk directly to the destination peg.\n5. Move the smallest disk to the destination peg.\n6. Move the second smallest disk on top of the largest disk.\n7. Finally, move the smallest disk on top of the second smallest disk.\n\nNow, let's generate the sequence of moves using Python code to ensure correctness:\n\n```python\ndef tower_of_hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [(1, source, target)]\n    \n    moves = []\n    # Move n-2 disks from source to auxiliary1 using auxiliary2 and target\n    moves += tower_of_hanoi_4_pegs(n-2, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target)\n    # Move the (n-1)th disk to auxiliary2\n    moves.append((n-1, source, auxiliary2))\n    # Move the nth disk to target\n    moves.append((n, source, target))\n    # Move the (n-1)th disk from auxiliary2 to target\n    moves.append((n-1, auxiliary2, target))\n    # Move n-2 disks from auxiliary1 to target using source and auxiliary2\n    moves += tower_of_hanoi_4_pegs(n-2, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2)\n    \n    return moves\n\n# Generate the sequence of moves for 3 disks and 4 pegs\nmoves = tower_of_hanoi_4_pegs(3, 1, 4, 2, 3)\nformatted_moves = [f\"Move disk {disk} from Peg {src} to Peg {dst}\" for disk, src, dst in moves]\nprint(\"\\n\".join(formatted_moves))\n```\n\nThis code will generate the sequence of moves for transferring 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 4 using 4 pegs. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code has successfully generated the sequence of moves for solving the Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks and 4 pegs. The sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n1. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n2. Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n3. Move disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\n4. Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n5. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n\nThis sequence efficiently utilizes the additional pegs to transfer all disks from Peg 1 to Peg 4.\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n>>>"
