    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 disks and 4 pegs, we need to use an algorithm that efficiently moves the disks from the source peg to the destination peg while adhering to the rules. The classic Tower of Hanoi problem is typically solved with 3 pegs, but with 4 pegs, we can use the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is a generalization for more than 3 pegs.\n\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm involves:\n1. Moving a subset of the largest disks to an auxiliary peg.\n2. Moving the remaining disks to the destination peg using the remaining pegs.\n3. Finally, moving the subset of the largest disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.\n\nLet's implement this algorithm in Python to generate the sequence of moves.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\"]\n    \n    moves = []\n    k = n - 2  # Optimal number of disks to move to auxiliary peg\n    # Move k disks to auxiliary1\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(k, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target)\n    # Move remaining n-k disks to target using auxiliary2\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n-k, source, target, auxiliary2)\n    # Move k disks from auxiliary1 to target\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(k, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2)\n    \n    return moves\n\ndef hanoi_3_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\"]\n    \n    moves = []\n    # Move n-1 disks to auxiliary\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n-1, source, auxiliary, target)\n    # Move nth disk to target\n    moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n    # Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to target\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n-1, auxiliary, target, source)\n    \n    return moves\n\n# Generate the sequence of moves for 4 disks and 4 pegs\nmoves = hanoi_4_pegs(4, 4, 1, 2, 3)\nprint(\"\\n\".join(moves))\n```\n\nThis code will generate the sequence of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 disks and 4 pegs, moving all disks from Peg 4 to Peg 1. Let's execute the code to get the sequence of moves.",
