    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 5 disks and 3 pegs, we need to follow a recursive approach. The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, where we move the top n-1 disks to an auxiliary peg, move the nth disk to the target peg, and then move the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\nThe recursive solution involves:\n1. Moving the top n-1 disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg.\n2. Moving the nth disk from the source peg to the target peg.\n3. Moving the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to generate the sequence of moves.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):\n    if n == 1:\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n    else:\n        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)\n\nmoves = []\nhanoi(5, 1, 3, 2, moves)\nprint(\"\\n\".join(moves))\n```\n\nThis code will generate the sequence of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem for 5 disks. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the sequence of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 5 disks. There were no errors in the execution. \n\nHere is the final answer with the sequence of moves:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n>>>"
