    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks and 4 pegs, we need to find an optimal sequence of moves that transfers all disks from Peg 2 to Peg 4. The additional peg allows for potentially fewer moves than the classic 3-peg problem.\n\nThe strategy for solving the Tower of Hanoi with 4 pegs is more complex than with 3 pegs. The Frame-Stewart algorithm is a well-known approach for solving the problem with more than 3 pegs. The algorithm involves breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems, moving a subset of disks to an auxiliary peg, moving the remaining disks directly to the target peg, and then moving the subset of disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\nLet's break down the problem and generate the sequence of moves:\n\n1. Move the top 2 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1 using Peg 3 and Peg 4 as auxiliary pegs.\n2. Move the largest disk (Disk 3) directly from Peg 2 to Peg 4.\n3. Move the 2 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 4 using Peg 2 and Peg 3 as auxiliary pegs.\n\nNow, let's implement this strategy in Python to generate the sequence of moves:\n\n```python\ndef move_disks(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, moves):\n    if n == 0:\n        return\n    if n == 1:\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n        return\n    # Move top n-1 disks from source to auxiliary1\n    move_disks(n-1, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target, moves)\n    # Move the nth disk from source to target\n    moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n    # Move the n-1 disks from auxiliary1 to target\n    move_disks(n-1, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2, moves)\n\n# Initialize the list to store the moves\nmoves = []\n# Solve the problem for 3 disks, moving from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nmove_disks(2, 2, 1, 3, 4, moves)  # Move top 2 disks to Peg 1\nmoves.append(\"Move disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\")  # Move largest disk to Peg 4\nmove_disks(2, 1, 4, 2, 3, moves)  # Move 2 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 4\n\n# Print the sequence of moves\nfor move in moves:\n    print(move)\n```\n\nThis code will generate the sequence of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks and 4 pegs, moving from Peg 2 to Peg 4. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the sequence of moves to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks and 4 pegs, moving from Peg 2 to Peg 4.
