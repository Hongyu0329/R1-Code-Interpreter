    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 6 disks and 3 pegs, we need to follow the recursive strategy. The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems:\n\n1. Move the top \\( n-1 \\) disks from the source peg to an auxiliary peg.\n2. Move the nth disk directly to the destination peg.\n3. Move the \\( n-1 \\) disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.\n\nFor 6 disks, the steps are as follows:\n\n- Move 5 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1 using Peg 2 as auxiliary.\n- Move the 6th disk from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n- Move 5 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 using Peg 3 as auxiliary.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to generate the sequence of moves.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):\n    if n == 1:\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n    else:\n        hanoi(n-1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n        hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)\n\nmoves = []\nhanoi(6, 3, 2, 1, moves)\nprint(\"\\n\".join(moves))\n```\n\nThis code will generate the sequence of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 6 disks, moving them from Peg 3 to Peg 2. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and generated the sequence of moves for solving the Tower of Hanoi problem with 6 disks, moving them from Peg 3 to Peg 2.
