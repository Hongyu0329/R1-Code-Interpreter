    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks and 4 pegs, we need to find an optimal sequence of moves that transfers all disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3, following the rules provided. The presence of an extra peg (4 pegs instead of the traditional 3) allows for potentially fewer moves than the classic 3-peg problem.\n\nThe strategy for solving the Tower of Hanoi with 4 pegs is more complex than with 3 pegs, but it generally involves using the extra peg to temporarily hold disks, allowing for more efficient movement of the larger disks.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:\n\n1. Move the smallest disk to the target peg.\n2. Use the extra peg to temporarily hold disks while moving larger disks directly to the target peg.\n3. Continue this process, using the extra peg to facilitate the movement of larger disks.\n\nLet's implement this strategy in Python to determine the sequence of moves.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, moves):\n    if n == 0:\n        return\n    if n == 1:\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n        return\n    hanoi_4_pegs(n - 2, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target, moves)\n    moves.append(f\"Move disk {n-1} from Peg {source} to Peg {auxiliary2}\")\n    moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n    moves.append(f\"Move disk {n-1} from Peg {auxiliary2} to Peg {target}\")\n    hanoi_4_pegs(n - 2, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2, moves)\n\nmoves = []\nhanoi_4_pegs(3, 1, 3, 2, 4, moves)\nprint(\"\\n\".join(moves))\n```\n\nThis code will generate the sequence of moves for transferring 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3 using 4 pegs. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided the sequence of moves to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks and 4 pegs. The sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n>>>"
