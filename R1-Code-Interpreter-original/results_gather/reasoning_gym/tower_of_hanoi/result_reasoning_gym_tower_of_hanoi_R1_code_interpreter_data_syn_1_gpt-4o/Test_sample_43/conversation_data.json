    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 6 disks and 4 pegs, we need to use an efficient algorithm that minimizes the number of moves. The classic Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 pegs has a well-known solution, but with 4 pegs, the problem becomes more complex.\n\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm is a well-known approach for solving the Tower of Hanoi problem with more than 3 pegs. The algorithm involves recursively breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems, using an intermediate peg to temporarily hold disks.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Move the top k disks to an intermediate peg.\n2. Move the remaining n-k disks directly to the destination peg.\n3. Move the k disks from the intermediate peg to the destination peg.\n\nThe challenge is to determine the optimal value of k that minimizes the total number of moves. For 6 disks and 4 pegs, we can use this approach to find the sequence of moves.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to generate the sequence of moves.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, moves):\n    if n == 0:\n        return\n    if n == 1:\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n        return\n\n    # Find the optimal k\n    k = n // 2\n\n    # Move k disks to auxiliary1\n    hanoi_4_pegs(k, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target, moves)\n\n    # Move n-k disks to target\n    hanoi_4_pegs(n - k, source, target, auxiliary2, auxiliary1, moves)\n\n    # Move k disks from auxiliary1 to target\n    hanoi_4_pegs(k, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2, moves)\n\nmoves = []\nhanoi_4_pegs(6, 4, 1, 2, 3, moves)\nprint(\"\\n\".join(moves))\n```\n\nThis code will generate the sequence of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 6 disks and 4 pegs, moving all disks from Peg 4 to Peg 1. Let's execute the code to get the sequence of moves.",
    "The code output indicates that there is an issue with the logic, as it repeatedly moves \"disk 1\" instead of correctly handling multiple disks. The Frame-Stewart algorithm requires careful handling of the recursive steps and the correct identification of disks being moved.\n\nLet's correct the implementation by ensuring that we handle each disk correctly and use the optimal strategy for moving disks between pegs. We need to ensure that the recursive calls are correctly managing the disks and that the moves are properly recorded.\n\nHere's the corrected implementation:\n\n```python\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, moves):\n    if n == 0:\n        return\n    if n == 1:\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n        return\n\n    # Find the optimal k\n    k = n // 2\n\n    # Move k disks to auxiliary1\n    hanoi_4_pegs(k, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target, moves)\n\n    # Move n-k disks to target\n    hanoi_4_pegs(n - k, source, target, auxiliary2, auxiliary1, moves)\n\n    # Move k disks from auxiliary1 to target\n    hanoi_4_pegs(k, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2, moves)\n\nmoves = []\nhanoi_4_pegs(6, 4, 1, 2, 3, moves)\nprint(\"\\n\".join(moves))\n```\n\nLet's execute this corrected code to generate the correct sequence of moves.",
    "The issue persists because the code is not correctly handling the disk numbers. The recursive function is not updating the disk number being moved, which is why it repeatedly outputs \"Move disk 1\". \n\nTo fix this, we need to ensure that the correct disk numbers are being moved in each step.
