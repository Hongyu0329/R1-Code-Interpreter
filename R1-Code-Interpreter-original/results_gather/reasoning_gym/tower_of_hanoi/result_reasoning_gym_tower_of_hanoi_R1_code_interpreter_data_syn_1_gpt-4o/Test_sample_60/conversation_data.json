    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 6 disks and 4 pegs, we need to use an efficient algorithm that minimizes the number of moves. The classic Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 pegs has a well-known recursive solution, but with 4 pegs, the problem becomes more complex.\n\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm is a well-known approach for solving the Tower of Hanoi problem with more than 3 pegs. The algorithm involves breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and using an additional peg to reduce the number of moves.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Move the top k disks to an auxiliary peg using all pegs.\n2. Move the remaining disks to the destination peg using the classic 3-peg solution.\n3. Move the k disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg using all pegs.\n\nThe challenge is to determine the optimal value of k that minimizes the total number of moves. For 6 disks and 4 pegs, we can use a known result or compute it to find the optimal k.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python to generate the sequence of moves.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [(1, source, target)]\n    \n    # Optimal k for 6 disks and 4 pegs is known to be 3\n    k = 3\n    \n    # Step 1: Move top k disks to auxiliary1 using all pegs\n    moves = hanoi_4_pegs(k, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target)\n    \n    # Step 2: Move remaining n-k disks to target using 3 pegs\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n - k, source, target, auxiliary2)\n    \n    # Step 3: Move k disks from auxiliary1 to target using all pegs\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(k, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2)\n    \n    return moves\n\ndef hanoi_3_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [(1, source, target)]\n    \n    moves = hanoi_3_pegs(n - 1, source, auxiliary, target)\n    moves.append((n, source, target))\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n - 1, auxiliary, target, source)\n    \n    return moves\n\n# Generate the sequence of moves\nmoves = hanoi_4_pegs(6, 1, 3, 2, 4)\n\n# Format the moves as required\nformatted_moves = [f\"Move disk {disk} from Peg {src} to Peg {dst}\" for disk, src, dst in moves]\n\n# Print the formatted moves\nfor move in formatted_moves:\n    print(move)\n```\n\nThis code will generate the sequence of moves for solving the Tower of Hanoi problem with 6 disks and 4 pegs, moving all disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The error indicates that there is a recursion issue in the `hanoi_4_pegs` function. This is likely due to the recursive call structure not properly reducing the problem size, leading to infinite recursion.\n\nTo address this, let's ensure that the recursive calls are correctly structured and that the base cases are properly defined. The Frame-Stewart algorithm should be implemented with careful attention to the recursive breakdown of the problem.\n\nLet's correct the implementation and ensure that the recursive calls are properly reducing the problem size:\n\n```python\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [(1, source, target)]\n    \n    # Optimal k for 6 disks and 4 pegs is known to be 3\n    k = 3\n    \n    # Step 1: Move top k disks to auxiliary1 using all pegs\n    moves = hanoi_4_pegs(k, source, auxiliary1, target, auxiliary2)\n    \n    # Step 2: Move remaining n-k disks to target using 3 pegs\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n - k, source, target, auxiliary2)\n    \n    # Step 3: Move k disks from auxiliary1 to target using all pegs\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(k, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2)\n    \n    return moves\n\ndef hanoi_3_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [(1, source, target)]\n    \n    moves = hanoi_3_pegs(n - 1, source, auxiliary, target)\n    moves.append((n, source, target))\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n - 1, auxiliary, target, source)\n    \n    return moves\n\n# Generate the sequence of moves\nmoves = hanoi_4_pegs(6, 1, 3, 2, 4)\n\n# Format the moves as required\nformatted_moves = [f\"Move disk {disk} from Peg {src} to Peg {dst}\" for disk, src, dst in moves]\n\n# Print the formatted moves\nfor move in formatted_moves:\n    print(move)\n```\n\nThis code should correctly implement the Frame-Stewart algorithm for 6 disks and 4 pegs.
