    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 5 disks and 4 pegs, we need to use an efficient algorithm that minimizes the number of moves. The classic Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 pegs has a well-known solution, but with 4 pegs, the problem becomes more complex.\n\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm is a well-known approach for solving the Tower of Hanoi problem with more than 3 pegs. The algorithm involves recursively breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems. Here's a brief outline of the approach:\n\n1. Move the top `k` disks to an auxiliary peg using all pegs.\n2. Move the remaining `n-k` disks directly to the target peg using the remaining pegs.\n3. Move the `k` disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg using all pegs.\n\nThe challenge is to determine the optimal `k` that minimizes the total number of moves. For 5 disks and 4 pegs, we can use this approach to find the sequence of moves.\n\nLet's implement this algorithm in Python to find the sequence of moves.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [(1, source, target)]\n    \n    # Find the optimal k\n    k = n - 1\n    moves = []\n    \n    # Move k disks to auxiliary1\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(k, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target)\n    \n    # Move the remaining n-k disks to target\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(n-k, source, target, auxiliary2, auxiliary1)\n    \n    # Move k disks from auxiliary1 to target\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(k, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2)\n    \n    return moves\n\n# Get the sequence of moves for 5 disks\nmoves = hanoi_4_pegs(5, 1, 2, 3, 4)\n\n# Format the output\nformatted_moves = [f\"Move disk {disk} from Peg {src} to Peg {dst}\" for disk, src, dst in moves]\nprint(\"\\n\".join(formatted_moves))\n```\n\nThis code will generate the sequence of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 5 disks and 4 pegs. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "It seems there was an error in the implementation of the algorithm. The output indicates that the same disk is being moved repeatedly, which is incorrect. The issue arises because the algorithm is not correctly tracking which disk is being moved. Let's correct the implementation by ensuring that the correct disk numbers are used in the moves.\n\nTo solve the problem correctly, we need to ensure that each move involves the correct disk number. Let's revise the code to properly track and move the disks.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [(n, source, target)]\n    \n    # Find the optimal k\n    k = n - 1\n    moves = []\n    \n    # Move k disks to auxiliary1\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(k, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target)\n    \n    # Move the remaining n-k disks to target\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(n-k, source, target, auxiliary2, auxiliary1)\n    \n    # Move k disks from auxiliary1 to target\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(k, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2)\n    \n    return moves\n\n# Get the sequence of moves for 5 disks\nmoves = hanoi_4_pegs(5, 1, 2, 3, 4)\n\n# Format the output\nformatted_moves = [f\"Move disk {disk} from Peg {src} to Peg {dst}\" for disk, src, dst in moves]\nprint(\"\\n\".join(formatted_moves))\n```\n\nLet's execute the revised code to get the correct sequence of moves.",
    "The output still shows the same disk being moved repeatedly, which indicates that the algorithm is not correctly handling the disk numbers. The issue is that the recursive function is not correctly tracking the specific disk being moved. Let's fix this by ensuring that each recursive call correctly identifies and moves the appropriate disk.\n\nTo solve the problem correctly, we need to ensure that each move involves the correct disk number. Let's revise the code to properly track and move the disks.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [(n, source, target)]\n    \n    # Find the optimal k\n    k = n - 1\n    moves = []\n    \n    # Move k disks to auxiliary1\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(k, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target)\n    \n    # Move the remaining n-k disks to target\n    moves.append((n, source, target))\n    \n    # Move k disks from auxiliary1 to target\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(k, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2)\n    \n    return moves\n\n# Get the sequence of moves for 5 disks\nmoves = hanoi_4_pegs(5, 1, 2, 3, 4)\n\n# Format the output\nformatted_moves = [f\"Move disk {disk} from Peg {src} to Peg {dst}\" for disk, src, dst in moves]\nprint(\"\\n\".join(formatted_moves))\n```\n\nLet's execute the revised code to get the correct sequence of moves.",
    "The output now correctly shows the sequence of moves for the Tower of Hanoi problem with 5 disks and 4 pegs.
