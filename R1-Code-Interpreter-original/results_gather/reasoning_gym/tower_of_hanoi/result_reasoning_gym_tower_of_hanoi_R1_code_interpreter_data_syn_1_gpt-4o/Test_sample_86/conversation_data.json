    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 disks and 4 pegs, we need to use an algorithm that efficiently utilizes the extra peg to minimize the number of moves. The classic Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 pegs is well-known, but with 4 pegs, we can use the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is a recursive method that optimizes the number of moves by using the extra peg.\n\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm involves:\n1. Moving a subset of the top disks to an auxiliary peg.\n2. Moving the remaining disks directly to the target peg.\n3. Moving the subset from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\nLet's implement this algorithm in Python to find the sequence of moves.\n\n```python\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [(1, source, target)]\n    \n    # Find the optimal number of disks to move to the auxiliary peg\n    k = n - 2\n    moves = []\n    \n    # Move k disks to auxiliary1\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(k, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target)\n    \n    # Move the remaining n-k disks to target using auxiliary2\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n - k, source, target, auxiliary2)\n    \n    # Move k disks from auxiliary1 to target\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(k, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2)\n    \n    return moves\n\ndef hanoi_3_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [(1, source, target)]\n    \n    moves = []\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n - 1, source, auxiliary, target)\n    moves.append((n, source, target))\n    moves += hanoi_3_pegs(n - 1, auxiliary, target, source)\n    \n    return moves\n\n# Get the sequence of moves for 4 disks and 4 pegs\nmoves = hanoi_4_pegs(4, 1, 3, 2, 4)\n\n# Format the moves\nformatted_moves = [f\"Move disk {disk} from Peg {src} to Peg {dst}\" for disk, src, dst in moves]\n\n# Print the formatted moves\nfor move in formatted_moves:\n    print(move)\n```\n\nThis code will generate the sequence of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 disks and 4 pegs. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
