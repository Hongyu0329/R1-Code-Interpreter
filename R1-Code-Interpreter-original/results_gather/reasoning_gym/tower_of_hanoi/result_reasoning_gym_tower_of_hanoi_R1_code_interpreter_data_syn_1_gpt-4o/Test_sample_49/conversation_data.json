    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks and 4 pegs, we need to use an algorithm that efficiently utilizes the extra peg to minimize the number of moves. The classic Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 pegs has a well-known solution, but with 4 pegs, the problem becomes more complex.\n\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm is a well-known approach for solving the Tower of Hanoi problem with more than 3 pegs. The algorithm involves recursively breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems, using the extra peg to reduce the number of moves.\n\nHere's the general idea of the Frame-Stewart algorithm:\n1. Move the top k disks to an auxiliary peg using all pegs.\n2. Move the remaining n-k disks directly to the destination peg using the remaining pegs.\n3. Move the k disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg using all pegs.\n\nThe challenge is to determine the optimal value of k that minimizes the total number of moves. For 7 disks and 4 pegs, we can use this approach to find the sequence of moves.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the sequence of moves:\n\n```python\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2):\n    if n == 0:\n        return []\n    if n == 1:\n        return [(1, source, target)]\n    \n    # Find the optimal k\n    min_moves = float('inf')\n    best_k = 0\n    for k in range(1, n):\n        moves = 2 * hanoi_4_pegs(k, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target) + hanoi_4_pegs(n-k, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2)\n        if len(moves) < min_moves:\n            min_moves = len(moves)\n            best_k = k\n    \n    # Perform the moves\n    moves = []\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(best_k, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target)\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(n-best_k, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2)\n    moves += hanoi_4_pegs(best_k, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2)\n    \n    return moves\n\ndef format_moves(moves):\n    return [f\"Move disk {disk} from Peg {src} to Peg {dst}\" for disk, src, dst in moves]\n\n# Solve the problem\nmoves = hanoi_4_pegs(7, 3, 4, 1, 2)\nformatted_moves = format_moves(moves)\nprint(\"\\n\".join(formatted_moves))\n```\n\nThis code will generate the sequence of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks and 4 pegs, moving the disks from Peg 3 to Peg 4. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "It seems there is an issue with the code logic, particularly in how the moves are being generated and recorded. The problem arises from the incorrect handling of disk numbers and the recursive logic for determining the optimal number of disks to move (k). Let's correct the code to ensure it properly tracks and outputs the correct sequence of moves for each disk.\n\nHere's the revised approach:\n\n1. Correctly implement the Frame-Stewart algorithm to handle the recursive breakdown of the problem.\n2.

    "The issue with the code is that it incorrectly handles the disk numbers, resulting in repeated moves for \"disk 1\" instead of correctly tracking and moving each disk.

    "The output still doesn't reflect the correct sequence of moves for the Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks and 4 pegs.
