    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 6 disks and 4 pegs, we need to use an efficient algorithm that minimizes the number of moves. The classic Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 pegs has a well-known solution, but with 4 pegs, the problem becomes more complex.\n\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm is a well-known approach for solving the Tower of Hanoi problem with more than 3 pegs. The algorithm involves recursively breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems. Here's a brief outline of the approach:\n\n1. Move the top `k` disks to an auxiliary peg using all pegs.\n2. Move the remaining `n-k` disks directly to the destination peg using the remaining pegs.\n3. Move the `k` disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg using all pegs.\n\nThe challenge is to determine the optimal `k` that minimizes the total number of moves. For 6 disks and 4 pegs, we can use this approach to find the sequence of moves.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the sequence of moves:\n\n```python\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, moves):\n    if n == 0:\n        return\n    if n == 1:\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n        return\n\n    # Find the optimal k\n    k = n // 2\n\n    # Step 1: Move the top k disks to auxiliary1\n    hanoi_4_pegs(k, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target, moves)\n\n    # Step 2: Move the remaining n-k disks to target\n    hanoi_3_pegs(n - k, source, target, auxiliary2, moves)\n\n    # Step 3: Move the k disks from auxiliary1 to target\n    hanoi_4_pegs(k, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2, moves)\n\ndef hanoi_3_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):\n    if n == 0:\n        return\n    if n == 1:\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n        return\n\n    hanoi_3_pegs(n - 1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)\n    moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n    hanoi_3_pegs(n - 1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)\n\n# Initialize the list to store moves\nmoves = []\n\n# Solve the problem for 6 disks and 4 pegs\nhanoi_4_pegs(6, 1, 4, 2, 3, moves)\n\n# Print the sequence of moves\nfor move in moves:\n    print(move)\n```\n\nThis code will generate the sequence of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 6 disks and 4 pegs. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code output indicates that the sequence of moves was generated, but there seems to be an error in the logic or implementation, as the output does not cover all 6 disks being moved from Peg 1 to Peg 4. The Frame-Stewart algorithm is complex, and the choice of `k` is crucial for minimizing the number of moves. Let's revisit the logic and ensure that the implementation correctly handles the recursive breakdown of the problem.\n\nThe key steps are:\n1. Move the top `k` disks to an auxiliary peg.\n2. Move the remaining `n-k` disks directly to the target peg.\n3. Move the `k` disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\nLet's correct the implementation and ensure it covers all disks:\n\n```python\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, moves):\n    if n == 0:\n        return\n    if n == 1:\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n        return\n\n    # Find the optimal k\n    k = n // 2\n\n    # Step 1: Move the top k disks to auxiliary1\n    hanoi_4_pegs(k, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target, moves)\n\n    # Step 2: Move the remaining n-k disks to target\n    hanoi_3_pegs(n - k, source, target, auxiliary2, moves)\n\n    # Step 3: Move the k disks from auxiliary1 to target\n    hanoi_4_pegs(k, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2, moves)\n\ndef hanoi_3_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):\n    if n == 0:\n        return\n    if n == 1:\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n        return\n\n    hanoi_3_pegs(n - 1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)\n    moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n    hanoi_3_pegs(n - 1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)\n\n# Initialize the list to store moves\nmoves = []\n\n# Solve the problem for 6 disks and 4 pegs\nhanoi_4_pegs(6, 1, 4, 2, 3, moves)\n\n# Print the sequence of moves\nfor move in moves:\n    print(move)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code again to verify the sequence of moves.",
    "The output indicates that the sequence of moves is not complete for moving all 6 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 4. The Frame-Stewart algorithm requires careful handling of the recursive steps and the choice of `k` to ensure all disks are moved correctly.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the approach and ensure that the recursive steps are correctly implemented. The choice of `k` should be such that it optimally divides the problem into manageable subproblems. For 6 disks, a common choice is `k = 3`, which means we first move 3 disks to an auxiliary peg, then move the remaining 3 disks directly to the target peg, and finally move the 3 disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\nLet's correct the implementation and ensure it covers all disks:\n\n```python\ndef hanoi_4_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, moves):\n    if n == 0:\n        return\n    if n == 1:\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n        return\n\n    # Choose k such that it optimally divides the problem\n    k = 3\n\n    # Step 1: Move the top k disks to auxiliary1\n    hanoi_4_pegs(k, source, auxiliary1, auxiliary2, target, moves)\n\n    # Step 2: Move the remaining n-k disks to target\n    hanoi_3_pegs(n - k, source, target, auxiliary2, moves)\n\n    # Step 3: Move the k disks from auxiliary1 to target\n    hanoi_4_pegs(k, auxiliary1, target, source, auxiliary2, moves)\n\ndef hanoi_3_pegs(n, source, target, auxiliary, moves):\n    if n == 0:\n        return\n    if n == 1:\n        moves.append(f\"Move disk 1 from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n        return\n\n    hanoi_3_pegs(n - 1, source, auxiliary, target, moves)\n    moves.append(f\"Move disk {n} from Peg {source} to Peg {target}\")\n    hanoi_3_pegs(n - 1, auxiliary, target, source, moves)\n\n# Initialize the list to store moves\nmoves = []\n\n# Solve the problem for 6 disks and 4 pegs\nhanoi_4_pegs(6, 1, 4, 2, 3, moves)\n\n# Print the sequence of moves\nfor move in moves:\n    print(move)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code again to verify the sequence of moves.",
    "The error indicates a recursion depth issue, which suggests that the recursive calls are not terminating correctly. This is likely due to the choice of `k` and the recursive structure not being properly aligned with the problem's requirements.\n\nTo solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 6 disks and 4 pegs, we need to ensure that the recursive calls are correctly structured and that the base cases are properly defined. Let's adjust the implementation to ensure it handles the recursive breakdown correctly.\n\nHere's a revised approach:\n\n1.
