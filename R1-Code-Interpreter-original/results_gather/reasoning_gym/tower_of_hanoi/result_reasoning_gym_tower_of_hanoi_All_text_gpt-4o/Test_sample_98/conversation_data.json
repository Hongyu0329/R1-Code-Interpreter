    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks and 4 pegs, we can use the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is a generalization of the classic three-peg solution. The algorithm involves breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems, moving a subset of disks to an auxiliary peg, and then moving the remaining disks directly to the target peg.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have 7 disks on Peg 3, and we need to move them to Peg 4 using Pegs 1 and 2 as auxiliary pegs.\n\n2. **Divide the Problem**: Choose a number `k` such that we first move the top `k` disks to an auxiliary peg, then move the remaining `7-k` disks directly to the target peg, and finally move the `k` disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\n3. **Optimal Substructure**: The choice of `k` is crucial for minimizing the number of moves. For 7 disks and 4 pegs, a common choice is `k=3`.\n\n4. **Recursive Steps**:\n   - Move the top 3 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1 using Pegs 2 and 4.\n   - Move the remaining 4 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 4 using Pegs 2 and 1.\n   - Move the 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 4 using Pegs 2 and 3.\n\n5. **Base Case**: For moving a single disk, simply move it directly to the target peg.\n\nNow, let's outline the sequence of moves:\n\n- **Move 3 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1**:\n  1. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n  2. Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n  3. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n  4. Move disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n  5. Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\n  6. Move disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n  7. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n\n- **Move 4 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 4**:\n  8. Move disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n  9. Move disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n  10. Move disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n  11. Move disk 6 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n  12. Move disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\n  13. Move disk 5 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n  14. Move disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n  15. Move disk 7 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n  16. Move disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n  17. Move disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n  18. Move disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\n  19. Move disk 6 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n  20. Move disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n  21. Move disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n  22. Move disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n\n- **Move 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 4**:\n  23. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n  24. Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\n  25. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n  26. Move disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\n  27. Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n  28. Move disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\n  29. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n\nThe sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 6 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 7 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 6 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n>>>"
