    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 5 disks and 3 pegs, we need to move all disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1 following the rules provided. The solution involves a recursive approach where we break down the problem into smaller sub-problems. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We have 5 disks on Peg 2, and we need to move them to Peg 1 using Peg 3 as an auxiliary peg. The disks are numbered from 1 (smallest) to 5 (largest).\n\n2. **Recursive Strategy**: \n   - Move the top 4 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3 using Peg 1 as auxiliary.\n   - Move the 5th disk (largest) from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n   - Move the 4 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1 using Peg 2 as auxiliary.\n\n3. **Base Case**: If there is only one disk, simply move it to the target peg.\n\n4. **Recursive Steps**:\n   - For `n` disks, move `n-1` disks to the auxiliary peg, move the `nth` disk to the target peg, and then move the `n-1` disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\n5. **Execution**:\n   - Move 4 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n   - Move disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n   - Move 4 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1.\n\nLet's list the sequence of moves:\n\n1. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n2. Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n3. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n4. Move disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n5. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n6. Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n7. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n8. Move disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n9. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n10. Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n11. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n12. Move disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n13. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n14. Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n15. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n16. Move disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n17. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n18. Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n19. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n20. Move disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n21. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n22. Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n23. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n24. Move disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n25. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n26. Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n27. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n28. Move disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n29. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n30. Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n31. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n\nThe sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n>>>"
