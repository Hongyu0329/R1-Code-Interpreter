    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks and 3 pegs, we need to follow a recursive strategy. The goal is to move all disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 using Peg 3 as an auxiliary peg. The process involves moving smaller subsets of disks recursively until the entire stack is transferred.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Base Case:**\n   - If there is only one disk, simply move it from the source peg to the destination peg.\n\n2. **Recursive Strategy:**\n   - To move `n` disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2:\n     1. Move the top `n-1` disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3 using Peg 2 as auxiliary.\n     2. Move the nth (largest) disk from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n     3. Move the `n-1` disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2 using Peg 1 as auxiliary.\n\n3. **Apply the Strategy for 7 Disks:**\n   - We will apply the recursive strategy to move 7 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n\n### Sequence of Moves:\n\n1. Move 6 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3 using Peg 2 as auxiliary.\n2. Move disk 7 from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n3. Move 6 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2 using Peg 1 as auxiliary.\n\n#### Detailed Moves:\n\n- **Move 6 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3:**\n  - Move 5 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 using Peg 3 as auxiliary.\n  - Move disk 6 from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n  - Move 5 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3 using Peg 1 as auxiliary.\n\n- **Move 5 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2:**\n  - Move 4 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3 using Peg 2 as auxiliary.\n  - Move disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n  - Move 4 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2 using Peg 1 as auxiliary.\n\n- **Move 4 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3:**\n  - Move 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 using Peg 3 as auxiliary.\n  - Move disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n  - Move 3 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3 using Peg 1 as auxiliary.\n\n- **Move 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2:**\n  - Move 2 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3 using Peg 2 as auxiliary.\n  - Move disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n  - Move 2 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2 using Peg 1 as auxiliary.\n\n- **Move 2 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3:**\n  - Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n  - Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n  - Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n\n- **Move 2 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2:**\n  - Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1.\n  - Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n  - Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n\n- **Move 3 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3:**\n  - Move 2 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1 using Peg 3 as auxiliary.\n  - Move disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n  - Move 2 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3 using Peg 2 as auxiliary.\n\n- **Move 4 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2:**\n  - Move 3 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1 using Peg 2 as auxiliary.\n  - Move disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n  - Move 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 using Peg 3 as auxiliary.\n\n- **Move 5 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3:**\n  - Move 4 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1 using Peg 3 as auxiliary.\n  - Move disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n  - Move 4 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3 using Peg 2 as auxiliary.\n\n- **Move 6 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2:**\n  - Move 5 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1 using Peg 2 as auxiliary.\n  - Move disk 6 from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n  - Move 5 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 using Peg 3 as auxiliary.\n\n### Final Sequence of Moves:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 6 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 7 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg"
