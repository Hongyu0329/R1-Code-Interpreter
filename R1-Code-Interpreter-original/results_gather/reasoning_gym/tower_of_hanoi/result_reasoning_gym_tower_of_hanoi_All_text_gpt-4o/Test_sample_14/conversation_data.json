    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks and 4 pegs, we need to carefully consider the rules and the additional peg available. The classic Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 pegs is well-known, but with 4 pegs, we can potentially reduce the number of moves required.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: \n   - Peg 1: Disks 1, 2, 3 (from top to bottom)\n   - Peg 2: Empty\n   - Peg 3: Empty\n   - Peg 4: Empty\n\n2. **Objective**: Move all disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3 using Pegs 2 and 4 as auxiliary pegs.\n\n3. **Strategy**: \n   - Use the additional peg to temporarily hold disks, allowing for more flexibility in moving larger disks.\n   - Move smaller disks to auxiliary pegs to free up larger disks for movement.\n\n4. **Execution**:\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4.\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4.\n   - Move disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1.\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3.\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n\nBy following these steps, we can efficiently move all disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3 using the additional peg to minimize the number of moves.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \n>>>"
