    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks and 3 pegs, we need to follow a recursive strategy. The goal is to move all disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1, using Peg 2 as an auxiliary peg. The process involves moving smaller subsets of disks recursively until the entire stack is transferred.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Base Case:**\n   - If there is only one disk, simply move it from the source peg to the destination peg.\n\n2. **Recursive Strategy:**\n   - To move `n` disks from a source peg to a destination peg using an auxiliary peg, follow these steps:\n     1. Move the top `n-1` disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg.\n     2. Move the `nth` disk (the largest disk) directly from the source peg to the destination peg.\n     3. Move the `n-1` disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.\n\n3. **Apply the Strategy for 7 Disks:**\n   - Move 6 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2 using Peg 1 as auxiliary.\n   - Move the 7th disk from Peg 3 to Peg 1.\n   - Move 6 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1 using Peg 3 as auxiliary.\n\n### Sequence of Moves:\n\nFollowing the recursive strategy, the sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n```\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 6 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 7 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 6 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n```\n\nThe above sequence of moves will successfully transfer all 7 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1 following the rules of the Tower of Hanoi.\n\nFinal answer:\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg"
