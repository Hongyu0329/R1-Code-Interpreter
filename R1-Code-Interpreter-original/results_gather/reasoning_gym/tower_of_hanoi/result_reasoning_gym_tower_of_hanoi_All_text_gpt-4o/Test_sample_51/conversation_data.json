    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 6 disks and 4 pegs, we can use the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is a generalization of the classic three-peg solution. The algorithm involves breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems, moving a subset of disks to an intermediate peg, then moving the remaining disks directly to the destination peg, and finally moving the subset of disks from the intermediate peg to the destination peg.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis and solution:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have 6 disks on Peg 1, and we need to move them to Peg 4 using Pegs 2 and 3 as intermediates.\n\n2. **Divide the Problem**: Choose a number of disks to move to an intermediate peg. A common strategy is to move the top 3 disks to an intermediate peg, then move the remaining 3 disks directly to the destination peg, and finally move the 3 disks from the intermediate peg to the destination peg.\n\n3. **Move 3 Disks to an Intermediate Peg**:\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n\n4. **Move Remaining 3 Disks to Destination Peg**:\n   - Move disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\n   - Move disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 6 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\n   - Move disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n   - Move disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n   - Move disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\n\n5. **Move 3 Disks from Intermediate Peg to Destination Peg**:\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n   - Move disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n\nBy following these steps, we can successfully move all 6 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 4 using 4 pegs.\n\nThe sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 6 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \n>>>"
