    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks and 3 pegs, where the disks need to be moved from Peg 2 to Peg 3, we will follow the rules and move the disks step by step. The disks are initially stacked on Peg 2, with Disk 1 being the smallest and on top, Disk 2 in the middle, and Disk 3 being the largest and at the bottom.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Move Disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3**: This is the smallest disk and can be moved directly to the destination peg.\n\n2. **Move Disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1**: To free up Disk 3, move Disk 2 to the auxiliary peg (Peg 1).\n\n3. **Move Disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1**: Move the smallest disk on top of Disk 2 on Peg 1.\n\n4. **Move Disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3**: Now that Peg 2 is clear, move the largest disk directly to the destination peg.\n\n5. **Move Disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2**: Move the smallest disk back to the original peg to free up Disk 2.\n\n6. **Move Disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3**: Move Disk 2 to the destination peg on top of Disk 3.\n\n7. **Move Disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3**: Finally, move the smallest disk to the destination peg on top of Disk 2.\n\n### Sequence of Moves:\n\nFollowing the above steps, the sequence of moves is:\n\n1. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n2. Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n3. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n4. Move disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n5. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n6. Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n7. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n>>>"
