    "The Tower of Hanoi problem with 5 disks and 4 pegs is a variation of the classic problem, which typically involves 3 pegs. The additional peg allows for a more efficient solution than the standard recursive approach used for 3 pegs. The Frame-Stewart algorithm is a well-known method for solving the Tower of Hanoi problem with more than 3 pegs. Here's a step-by-step analysis and solution:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We have 5 disks of different sizes, and we need to move them from Peg 1 to Peg 2 using Pegs 3 and 4 as auxiliary pegs. The rules are:\n   - Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n   - A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.\n   - All disks must be on a peg at all times.\n\n2. **Frame-Stewart Algorithm**: This algorithm involves breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems. The idea is to move a subset of disks to an auxiliary peg, then move the remaining disks directly to the target peg, and finally move the subset from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\n3. **Determine the Optimal Subset**: For 5 disks and 4 pegs, the optimal subset to move first is typically the largest subset that can be moved efficiently. In this case, we can move 3 disks to an auxiliary peg, then move the remaining 2 disks directly to the target peg, and finally move the 3 disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\n4. **Execute the Moves**:\n   - Move the top 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3 using Pegs 2 and 4 as auxiliary pegs.\n   - Move the remaining 2 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 using Peg 4 as an auxiliary peg.\n   - Move the 3 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2 using Pegs 1 and 4 as auxiliary pegs.\n\n5. **Sequence of Moves**:\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n   - Move disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n   - Move disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\n   - Move disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n   - Move disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n   - Move disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n   - Move disk 5 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n\nThe sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 5 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n>>>"
