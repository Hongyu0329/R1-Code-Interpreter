    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 6 disks and 3 pegs, we need to follow a recursive strategy. The goal is to move all disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1, adhering to the rules provided. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Understand the Base Case**: \n   - If there is only one disk, simply move it from the source peg to the destination peg.\n\n2. **Recursive Strategy**:\n   - To move `n` disks from a source peg to a destination peg using an auxiliary peg, follow these steps:\n     1. Move the top `n-1` disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg.\n     2. Move the `nth` disk directly from the source peg to the destination peg.\n     3. Move the `n-1` disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.\n\n3. **Apply the Strategy for 6 Disks**:\n   - We will move 5 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2, then move the 6th disk from Peg 3 to Peg 1, and finally move the 5 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n\n4. **Break Down the Moves**:\n   - Move 5 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2 using Peg 1 as auxiliary.\n   - Move disk 6 from Peg 3 to Peg 1.\n   - Move 5 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1 using Peg 3 as auxiliary.\n\n5. **Recursive Steps for 5 Disks**:\n   - Move 4 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1 using Peg 2 as auxiliary.\n   - Move disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n   - Move 4 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 using Peg 3 as auxiliary.\n\n6. **Continue Breaking Down**:\n   - Continue breaking down each step recursively until reaching the base case of moving a single disk.\n\nFollowing this recursive strategy, the sequence of moves for 6 disks is as follows:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 6 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \n>>>\n"
