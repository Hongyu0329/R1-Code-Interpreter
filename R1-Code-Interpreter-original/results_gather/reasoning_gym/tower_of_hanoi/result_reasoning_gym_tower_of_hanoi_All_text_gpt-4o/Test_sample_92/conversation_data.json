    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 5 disks and 3 pegs, we need to follow a systematic approach. The goal is to move all disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3, adhering to the rules provided. The solution involves recursive steps, where we break down the problem into smaller sub-problems.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Base Case:**\n   - For 1 disk, simply move it from the source peg to the destination peg.\n\n2. **Recursive Approach:**\n   - To move `n` disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3 using Peg 2 as an auxiliary peg:\n     1. Move `n-1` disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 using Peg 3 as an auxiliary peg.\n     2. Move the nth (largest) disk from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n     3. Move the `n-1` disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3 using Peg 1 as an auxiliary peg.\n\n3. **Apply the Recursive Approach for 5 Disks:**\n   - Move 4 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 using Peg 3.\n   - Move the 5th disk from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n   - Move 4 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3 using Peg 1.\n\n### Sequence of Moves:\n\nFollowing the recursive approach, the sequence of moves for 5 disks is as follows:\n\n1. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n2. Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n3. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n4. Move disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n5. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n6. Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n7. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n8. Move disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n9. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n10. Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n11. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n12. Move disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n13. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n14. Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n15. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n16. Move disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n17. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n18. Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n19. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n20. Move disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n21. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n22. Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n23. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n24. Move disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n25. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n26. Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n27. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n28. Move disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n29. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n30. Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n31. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n\nThe sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n>>>"
