    "The Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 pegs is a more complex version of the classic 3-peg problem. The goal is to move all disks from the source peg to the target peg using the additional peg(s) to facilitate the process. The Frame-Stewart algorithm is a well-known approach to solve this problem optimally.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We have 7 disks and 4 pegs.\n   - The disks are initially stacked on Peg 1, and we need to move them to Peg 3.\n   - We can use Pegs 2 and 4 as auxiliary pegs.\n   - We must follow the rules: move one disk at a time, never place a larger disk on a smaller one, and all disks must be on a peg.\n\n2. **Frame-Stewart Algorithm:**\n   - This algorithm involves breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems.\n   - For 7 disks and 4 pegs, the optimal strategy involves moving a subset of disks to an auxiliary peg, moving the remaining disks directly to the target peg, and then moving the subset from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\n3. **Determine the Subset Size:**\n   - For 7 disks, a common strategy is to move the top 4 disks to an auxiliary peg, then move the remaining 3 disks directly to the target peg, and finally move the 4 disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\n4. **Execute the Moves:**\n   - Move the top 4 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 using Pegs 3 and 4 as auxiliary pegs.\n   - Move the remaining 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3 using Peg 4 as an auxiliary peg.\n   - Move the 4 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3 using Pegs 1 and 4 as auxiliary pegs.\n\n### Sequence of Moves:\n\nFollowing the above strategy, the sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n```\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 6 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 7 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 6 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\n"
