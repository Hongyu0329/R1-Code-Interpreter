    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 6 disks and 4 pegs, we can use the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is a generalization of the classic three-peg solution. The algorithm involves breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems, moving a subset of disks to an auxiliary peg, moving the remaining disks directly to the target peg, and then moving the subset of disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Choose a subset of disks to move to an auxiliary peg.**  \n   For 6 disks, a common strategy is to move the top 3 disks to an auxiliary peg, leaving the bottom 3 disks to be moved directly to the target peg.\n\n2. **Move the top 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 (auxiliary peg).**  \n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n   - Move disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n\n3. **Move the bottom 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 4 (target peg).**  \n   - Move disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\n   - Move disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n   - Move disk 6 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\n\n4. **Move the top 3 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 4.**  \n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n\nBy following these steps, all disks are successfully moved from Peg 1 to Peg 4, adhering to the rules of the Tower of Hanoi problem.\n\nThe sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 6 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n>>>"
