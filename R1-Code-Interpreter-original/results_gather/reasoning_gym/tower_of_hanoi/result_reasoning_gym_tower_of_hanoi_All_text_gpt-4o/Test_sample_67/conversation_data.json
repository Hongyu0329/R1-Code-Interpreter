    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 6 disks and 4 pegs, we can use the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is a generalization of the classic three-peg solution. The algorithm involves breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems, moving a subset of disks to an auxiliary peg, moving the remaining disks directly to the target peg, and then moving the subset of disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have 6 disks on Peg 2, and we need to move them to Peg 3 using Pegs 1 and 4 as auxiliary pegs.\n\n2. **Divide the Problem**: \n   - Move the top 3 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n   - Move the remaining 3 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n   - Move the 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n\n3. **Solve the Subproblems**:\n   - For moving 3 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1, use Pegs 3 and 4 as auxiliary pegs.\n   - For moving 3 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3, use Pegs 1 and 4 as auxiliary pegs.\n   - For moving 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3, use Pegs 2 and 4 as auxiliary pegs.\n\n4. **Execute the Moves**:\n   - Move 3 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1:\n     - Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n     - Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n     - Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n     - Move disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n     - Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n     - Move disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n     - Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n\n   - Move 3 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3:\n     - Move disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n     - Move disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n     - Move disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n     - Move disk 6 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n     - Move disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n     - Move disk 5 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\n     - Move disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n\n   - Move 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3:\n     - Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\n     - Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n     - Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\n     - Move disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\n     - Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n     - Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n     - Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\n\n5. **Final Sequence of Moves**:\n   - Combine all the moves in the order they were executed.\n\nThe final sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 6 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 5 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\n>>>"
