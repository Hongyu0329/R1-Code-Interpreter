    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 6 disks and 4 pegs, we can use the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is a generalization of the classic three-peg problem. The algorithm involves breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems, using an intermediate peg to facilitate the transfer of disks.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have 6 disks on Peg 2, and we need to move them to Peg 1 using Pegs 3 and 4 as auxiliary pegs.\n\n2. **Divide the Problem**: \n   - Move the top 3 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3 using Pegs 1 and 4 as auxiliary pegs.\n   - Move the remaining 3 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1 using Pegs 3 and 4 as auxiliary pegs.\n   - Finally, move the 3 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1 using Pegs 2 and 4 as auxiliary pegs.\n\n3. **Recursive Steps**:\n   - For moving 3 disks from one peg to another using 4 pegs, we can use the same strategy:\n     - Move the top 2 disks to an auxiliary peg.\n     - Move the remaining disk directly to the destination peg.\n     - Move the 2 disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.\n\n4. **Execution**:\n   - Follow the recursive steps to move the disks as described.\n\nNow, let's list the sequence of moves:\n\n1. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n2. Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n3. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\n4. Move disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n5. Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n6. Move disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\n7. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n8. Move disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n9. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n10. Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n11. Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n12. Move disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n13. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n14. Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n15. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n16.
