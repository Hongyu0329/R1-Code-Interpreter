    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 disks and 4 pegs, we need to carefully plan the sequence of moves to transfer all disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1 while adhering to the rules. The presence of an extra peg allows for a more efficient solution than the classic 3-peg problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - Disks are initially on Peg 3, and we need to move them to Peg 1.\n   - Pegs available: Peg 2 and Peg 4 as auxiliary pegs.\n\n2. **Strategy:**\n   - Use the extra peg to simplify the process by temporarily holding disks.\n   - Move smaller groups of disks to auxiliary pegs to free up larger disks.\n\n3. **Move Sequence:**\n   - Move the smallest group of disks to an auxiliary peg.\n   - Move the next larger disk directly to the destination peg.\n   - Move the smaller group of disks on top of the larger disk.\n   - Repeat the process for remaining disks.\n\n### Sequence of Moves:\n\n1. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n2. Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n3. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n4. Move disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n5. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n6. Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n7. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n8. Move disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n9. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n10. Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n11. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n12. Move disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\n13. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n14. Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n15. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\n16. Move disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n17. Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\n18. Move disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n19. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n20. Move disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\n21. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n22. Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n23. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n24. Move disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n25. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n26. Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n27. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 1\n\nThe sequence of moves is designed to efficiently utilize the extra peg, minimizing the total number of moves required.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 1\n>>>"
