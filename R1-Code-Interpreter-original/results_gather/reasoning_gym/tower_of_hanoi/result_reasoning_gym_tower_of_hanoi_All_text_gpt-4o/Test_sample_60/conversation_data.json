    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 6 disks and 4 pegs, we can use the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is a generalization of the classic three-peg problem. The algorithm involves breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and using an additional peg to minimize the number of moves.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - We have 6 disks on Peg 1, and we need to move them to Peg 3 using Pegs 2 and 4 as auxiliary pegs.\n\n2. **Divide the Problem:**\n   - Choose a number `k` such that `1 <= k < 6`. A common choice is to move the top `k` disks to an auxiliary peg, then move the remaining `6-k` disks directly to the destination peg, and finally move the `k` disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.\n\n3. **Optimal Subdivision:**\n   - For 6 disks and 4 pegs, a good choice is `k = 3`. This means:\n     - Move the top 3 disks to an auxiliary peg (Peg 2).\n     - Move the remaining 3 disks directly to the destination peg (Peg 3).\n     - Move the 3 disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.\n\n4. **Execution of Moves:**\n   - **Move 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 using Pegs 3 and 4:**\n     - Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n     - Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\n     - Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n     - Move disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n     - Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n     - Move disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n     - Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n\n   - **Move 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3 using Peg 4:**\n     - Move disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n     - Move disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\n     - Move disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n     - Move disk 6 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n     - Move disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n     - Move disk 5 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\n     - Move disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n\n   - **Move 3 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3 using Pegs 1 and 4:**\n     - Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n     - Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n     - Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\n     - Move disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n     - Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n     - Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n     - Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n     - Move disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\n     - Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\n     - Move disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n     - Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n     - Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n     - Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n\n5. **Final Sequence of Moves:**\n   - The sequence of moves is derived from the above steps.\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 6 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 5 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n>>>"
