    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 6 disks and 4 pegs, we can use the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is a generalization of the classic three-peg solution. The algorithm involves breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems, moving a subset of disks to an auxiliary peg, moving the remaining disks directly to the target peg, and then moving the subset of disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the solution:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have 6 disks on Peg 3, and we need to move them to Peg 4 using Pegs 1 and 2 as auxiliary pegs.\n\n2. **Divide the Problem**: Choose a number `k` such that we move the top `k` disks to an auxiliary peg, then move the remaining `n-k` disks directly to the target peg, and finally move the `k` disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\n3. **Optimal Subdivision**: For 6 disks and 4 pegs, a common choice is to move the top 3 disks to an auxiliary peg, then move the remaining 3 disks directly to the target peg, and finally move the 3 disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\n4. **Move Top 3 Disks**: Move the top 3 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1 using Pegs 2 and 4 as auxiliary pegs.\n\n5. **Move Remaining 3 Disks**: Move the remaining 3 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 4 directly.\n\n6. **Move 3 Disks from Auxiliary Peg**: Move the 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 4 using Pegs 2 and 3 as auxiliary pegs.\n\nNow, let's list the sequence of moves:\n\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n- Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n- Move disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\n- Move disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n- Move disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to
