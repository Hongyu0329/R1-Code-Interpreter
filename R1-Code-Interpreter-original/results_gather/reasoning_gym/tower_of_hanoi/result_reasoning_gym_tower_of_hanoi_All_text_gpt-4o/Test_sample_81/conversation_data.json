    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks and 4 pegs, we need to carefully consider the rules and the additional peg available. The goal is to move all disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2, using Pegs 3 and 4 as auxiliary pegs. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: \n   - Peg 1: Disks 1, 2, 3 (from top to bottom)\n   - Peg 2: Empty\n   - Peg 3: Empty\n   - Peg 4: Empty\n\n2. **Objective**: Move all disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n\n3. **Strategy**: \n   - Use the additional peg to temporarily hold disks, allowing more flexibility in moving disks.\n   - Move smaller groups of disks to auxiliary pegs to free up larger disks.\n\n4. **Steps**:\n   - Move Disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n   - Move Disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n   - Move Disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3 (now both Disk 1 and Disk 2 are on Peg 3).\n   - Move Disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n   - Move Disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1.\n   - Move Disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n   - Move Disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2 (all disks are now on Peg 2).\n\n5. **Sequence of Moves**:\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n\nThe sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \n>>>"
