    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks and 3 pegs, we need to move all disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 while following the rules. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We have 3 disks of different sizes, initially stacked on Peg 1.\n   - The goal is to move all disks to Peg 2.\n   - We can use Peg 3 as an auxiliary peg.\n   - We must follow the rules: move one disk at a time, never place a larger disk on a smaller one, and all disks must remain on a peg.\n\n2. **Plan the Moves:**\n   - The strategy involves moving smaller subsets of disks to the auxiliary peg, then moving the largest disk, and finally moving the smaller disks on top of the largest disk on the destination peg.\n\n3. **Execute the Moves:**\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n   - Move disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n   - Move disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1.\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n\n4. **Verify the Solution:**\n   - Ensure all disks are moved to Peg 2 in the correct order, with the largest disk at the bottom and the smallest at the top.\n\nThe sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n>>>"
