    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 disks and 4 pegs, we need to carefully consider the rules and the additional peg available. The classic Tower of Hanoi problem is typically solved with 3 pegs, but having an extra peg allows for a more efficient solution.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of how to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We have 4 disks of different sizes on Peg 2, and we need to move them to Peg 3 using Pegs 1 and 4 as auxiliary pegs. The disks are initially stacked in decreasing size from bottom to top.\n\n2. **Rules to Follow**:\n   - Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n   - A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.\n   - All disks must be on a peg at all times.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Use the extra peg to temporarily hold disks, allowing for more flexibility in moving the disks.\n   - Move smaller groups of disks to auxiliary pegs to free up larger disks for movement.\n   - Gradually build the stack on the destination peg (Peg 3) in the correct order.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Solution**:\n   - Move the top 2 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n   - Move the next disk (Disk 3) from Peg 2 to Peg 4.\n   - Move the 2 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 4 on top of Disk 3.\n   - Move the largest disk (Disk 4) from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n   - Move the 3 disks from Peg 4 to Peg 3.\n\n5. **Sequence of Moves**:\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\n   - Move disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n   - Move disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\n\nBy following these steps, all disks are successfully moved from Peg 2 to Peg 3, adhering to the rules of the Tower of Hanoi problem.\n\nThe final sequence of moves is:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\n>>>"
