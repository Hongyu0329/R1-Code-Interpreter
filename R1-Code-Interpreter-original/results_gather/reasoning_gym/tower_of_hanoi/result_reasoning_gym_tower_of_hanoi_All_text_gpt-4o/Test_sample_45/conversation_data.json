    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 5 disks and 4 pegs, we can use the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is a generalization of the classic Tower of Hanoi problem for more than three pegs. The algorithm involves breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and using an additional peg to facilitate the transfer of disks.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - We have 5 disks on Peg 2, and we need to move them to Peg 1 using Pegs 3 and 4 as auxiliary pegs.\n\n2. **Strategy:**\n   - The Frame-Stewart algorithm suggests moving a subset of the largest disks to an auxiliary peg, then moving the remaining smaller disks directly to the destination peg, and finally moving the subset of larger disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.\n\n3. **Breakdown:**\n   - Move the top 3 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3 using Pegs 1 and 4.\n   - Move the remaining 2 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1 using Peg 4.\n   - Move the 3 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1 using Pegs 2 and 4.\n\n4. **Execution:**\n   - **Move 3 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3:**\n     - Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n     - Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n     - Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\n     - Move disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n     - Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n     - Move disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\n     - Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n\n   - **Move 2 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1:**\n     - Move disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n     - Move disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n     - Move disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\n     - Move disk 5 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n     - Move disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n\n   - **Move 3 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1:**\n     - Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n     - Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n     - Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n     - Move disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n     - Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n     - Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\n     - Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n     - Move disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n     - Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n     - Move disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n     - Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 1\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 5 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 1\n>>>"
