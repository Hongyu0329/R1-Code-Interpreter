    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 disks and 4 pegs, we need to carefully consider the rules and the additional peg available. The classic Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 pegs has a well-known recursive solution, but with 4 pegs, we can use the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is a generalization for more than 3 pegs.\n\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm involves the following steps:\n1. Move the top k disks to an auxiliary peg using all pegs.\n2. Move the remaining n-k disks directly to the destination peg using the remaining pegs.\n3. Move the k disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.\n\nFor 4 disks and 4 pegs, the optimal strategy is to move 2 disks to an auxiliary peg, then move the remaining 2 disks directly to the destination peg, and finally move the 2 disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Move the top 2 disks (Disk 1 and Disk 2) from Peg 4 to Peg 1 using Pegs 2 and 3 as auxiliary pegs.\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n\n2. Move the remaining 2 disks (Disk 3 and Disk 4) from Peg 4 to Peg 2 using Pegs 3 and 1 as auxiliary pegs.\n   - Move disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n   - Move disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n\n3. Move the 2 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2 using Pegs 4 and 1 as auxiliary pegs.\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n\nNow, let's list the sequence of moves:\n\n1. Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n2. Move disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\n3. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n4. Move disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n5. Move disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n6. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n7. Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n8. Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n\nThe sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n>>>"
