    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 6 disks and 3 pegs, we need to follow a systematic approach. The goal is to move all disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1, adhering to the rules provided. The solution involves recursive steps, where we break down the problem into smaller sub-problems.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Base Case:**\n   - For 1 disk, simply move it from the source peg to the destination peg.\n\n2. **Recursive Approach:**\n   - To move `n` disks from a source peg to a destination peg using an auxiliary peg, follow these steps:\n     1. Move the top `n-1` disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg.\n     2. Move the `nth` disk directly from the source peg to the destination peg.\n     3. Move the `n-1` disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.\n\n3. **Apply the Recursive Approach for 6 Disks:**\n   - Move 5 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2 using Peg 1 as auxiliary.\n   - Move the 6th disk from Peg 3 to Peg 1.\n   - Move 5 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1 using Peg 3 as auxiliary.\n\n### Sequence of Moves:\n\nFollowing the recursive approach, the sequence of moves for 6 disks is as follows:\n\n1. Move 5 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2 using Peg 1 as auxiliary:\n   - Move 4 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1 using Peg 2 as auxiliary.\n     - Move 3 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2 using Peg 1 as auxiliary.\n       - Move 2 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1 using Peg 2 as auxiliary.\n         - Move 1 disk from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n         - Move 1 disk from Peg 3 to Peg 1.\n         - Move 1 disk from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n       - Move 1 disk from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n       - Move 2 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 using Peg 3 as auxiliary.\n         - Move 1 disk from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n         - Move 1 disk from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n         - Move 1 disk from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n     - Move 1 disk from Peg 3 to Peg 1.\n     - Move 3 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1 using Peg 3 as auxiliary.\n       - Move 2 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3 using Peg 1 as auxiliary.\n         - Move 1 disk from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n         - Move 1 disk from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n         - Move 1 disk from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n       - Move 1 disk from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n       - Move 2 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1 using Peg 2 as auxiliary.\n         - Move 1 disk from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n         - Move 1 disk from Peg 3 to Peg 1.\n         - Move 1 disk from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n   - Move 1 disk from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n   - Move 4 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 using Peg 3 as auxiliary.\n     - Move 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3 using Peg 2 as auxiliary.\n       - Move 2 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 using Peg 3 as auxiliary.\n         - Move 1 disk from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n         - Move 1 disk from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n         - Move 1 disk from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n       - Move 1 disk from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n       - Move 2 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3 using Peg 1 as auxiliary.\n         - Move 1 disk from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n         - Move 1 disk from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n         - Move 1 disk from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n     - Move 1 disk from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n     - Move 3 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2 using Peg 1 as auxiliary.\n       - Move 2 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1 using Peg 2 as auxiliary.\n         - Move 1 disk from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n         - Move 1 disk from Peg 3 to Peg 1.\n         - Move 1 disk from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n       - Move 1 disk from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n       - Move 2 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 using Peg 3 as auxiliary.\n         - Move 1 disk from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n         - Move 1 disk from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n         - Move 1 disk from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n\n2.
