    "The Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks and 4 pegs is a more complex version of the classic problem, which typically involves 3 pegs. The addition of a fourth peg allows for more efficient solutions, but it also requires a different strategy than the standard 3-peg problem.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is a recursive method designed for the Tower of Hanoi with more than three pegs. The algorithm involves breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems, moving a subset of disks to an auxiliary peg, and then moving the remaining disks directly to the target peg.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the solution:\n\n1. **Identify the number of disks (n = 7) and pegs (4 pegs: Peg 1, Peg 2, Peg 3, Peg 4).**\n2. **Determine the optimal number of disks to move in the first step (k).** For 7 disks and 4 pegs, a common choice is to move 4 disks in the first step.\n3. **Move the top k disks (4 disks) to an auxiliary peg (Peg 1) using all 4 pegs.**\n4. **Move the remaining n-k disks (3 disks) directly to the target peg (Peg 4) using the remaining pegs (Peg 2, Peg 3, Peg 4).**\n5. **Move the k disks from the auxiliary peg (Peg 1) to the target peg (Peg 4) using all 4 pegs.**\n\nFollowing these steps, we can derive the sequence of moves:\n\n1. Move 4 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1 using Peg 2 and Peg 4 as auxiliary pegs.\n2. Move 3 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 4 using Peg 2 as an auxiliary peg.\n3. Move 4 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 4 using Peg 2 and Peg 3 as auxiliary pegs.\n\nThe detailed sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n```\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 6 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 7 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 6 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk "
