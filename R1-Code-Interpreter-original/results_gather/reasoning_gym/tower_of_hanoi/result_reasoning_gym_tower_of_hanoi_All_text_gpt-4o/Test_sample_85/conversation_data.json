    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 disks and 3 pegs, we need to follow a systematic approach. The goal is to move all disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3, adhering to the rules provided. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We have 4 disks of different sizes, and we need to move them from Peg 1 to Peg 3 using Peg 2 as an auxiliary peg. The rules are:\n   - Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n   - A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.\n   - All disks must be on a peg at all times.\n\n2. **Recursive Strategy**: The Tower of Hanoi problem is typically solved using a recursive strategy. The idea is to break down the problem into smaller sub-problems:\n   - Move the top n-1 disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg.\n   - Move the nth (largest) disk directly to the destination peg.\n   - Move the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.\n\n3. **Apply the Strategy for 4 Disks**:\n   - Move the top 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n   - Move the 4th disk from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n   - Move the 3 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n\n4. **Detailed Steps**:\n   - Move 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 using Peg 3 as auxiliary.\n     - Move 2 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3 using Peg 2 as auxiliary.\n       - Move 1 disk from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n       - Move 1 disk from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n       - Move 1 disk from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n     - Move 1 disk from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n     - Move 2 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2 using Peg 1 as auxiliary.\n       - Move 1 disk from Peg 3 to Peg 1.\n       - Move 1 disk from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n       - Move 1 disk from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n   - Move 1 disk from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n   - Move 3 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3 using Peg 1 as auxiliary.\n     - Move 2 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1 using Peg 3 as auxiliary.\n       - Move 1 disk from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n       - Move 1 disk from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n       - Move 1 disk from Peg 3 to Peg 1.\n     - Move 1 disk from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n     - Move 2 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3 using Peg 2 as auxiliary.\n       - Move 1 disk from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n       - Move 1 disk from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n       - Move 1 disk from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n\n5. **Sequence of Moves**:\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n   - Move disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n   - Move disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n\nThe final sequence of moves is:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n>>>"
