    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 6 disks and 3 pegs, we need to follow a systematic approach. The goal is to move all disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2, adhering to the rules provided. The solution involves recursive steps, where we break down the problem into smaller sub-problems.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Base Case:**\n   - For 1 disk, simply move it from the source peg to the destination peg.\n\n2. **Recursive Approach:**\n   - To move `n` disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 using Peg 3 as auxiliary:\n     1. Move `n-1` disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3 using Peg 2 as auxiliary.\n     2. Move the nth (largest) disk from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n     3. Move the `n-1` disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2 using Peg 1 as auxiliary.\n\n3. **Apply the Recursive Approach for 6 Disks:**\n   - Move 5 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n   - Move the 6th disk from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n   - Move 5 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n\n### Sequence of Moves:\n\nFollowing the recursive approach, the sequence of moves for 6 disks is as follows:\n\n1. Move 5 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3:\n   - Move 4 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n   - Move the 5th disk from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n   - Move 4 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n\n2. Move the 6th disk from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n\n3. Move 5 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2:\n   - Move 4 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1.\n   - Move the 5th disk from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n   - Move 4 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n\n### Detailed Sequence of Moves:\n\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n- Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n- Move disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n- Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n- Move disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n- Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n- Move disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n- Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n- Move disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n- Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n- Move disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n- Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n- Move disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n- Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n- Move disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n- Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n- Move disk 6 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n- Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n- Move disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n- Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n- Move disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n- Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n- Move disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n- Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n- Move disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n- Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n- Move disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n- Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n- Move disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n- Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n- Move disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n- Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n\nThe complete sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 6 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2"
