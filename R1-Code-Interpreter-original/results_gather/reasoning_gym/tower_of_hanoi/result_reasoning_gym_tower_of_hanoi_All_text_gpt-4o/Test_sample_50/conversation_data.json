    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 disks and 4 pegs, we need to carefully consider the rules and the additional peg available. The classic Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 pegs is well-known, but with 4 pegs, we can use the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is a generalization for more than 3 pegs.\n\nThe Frame-Stewart algorithm involves the following steps:\n1. Move the top k disks to an auxiliary peg using all pegs.\n2. Move the remaining n-k disks directly to the destination peg using the remaining pegs.\n3. Move the k disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg using all pegs.\n\nFor 4 disks and 4 pegs, the optimal solution involves moving 2 disks at a time. Let's break it down:\n\n1. Move the top 2 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2 using Pegs 1, 2, and 4.\n2. Move the remaining 2 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1 using Pegs 1, 3, and 4.\n3. Move the 2 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1 using Pegs 1, 2, and 4.\n\nLet's detail each step:\n\n**Step 1: Move the top 2 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2**\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n- Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\n- Move disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\n- Move disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n\n**Step 2: Move the remaining 2 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1**\n- Move disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n- Move disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n\n**Step 3: Move the 2 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1**\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n- Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n\nNow, let's compile the sequence of moves:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \n>>>"
