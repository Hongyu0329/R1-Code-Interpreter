    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 disks and 4 pegs, we need to carefully plan the sequence of moves to transfer all disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3 while adhering to the rules. The presence of an extra peg allows for a more efficient solution than the classic 3-peg problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - Disks are numbered 1 to 4, with 1 being the smallest and 4 the largest.\n   - All disks start on Peg 1.\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move all disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3 using Pegs 2 and 4 as auxiliary pegs.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Use the extra peg to simplify the process by temporarily storing disks.\n   - Move smaller groups of disks to auxiliary pegs to free up larger disks.\n\n4. **Execution:**\n   - Move the top 2 disks (1 and 2) to Peg 2.\n   - Move disk 3 to Peg 4.\n   - Move disks 1 and 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n   - Move disk 4 to Peg 3.\n   - Move disks 1 and 2 to Peg 4.\n   - Move disk 3 to Peg 3.\n   - Finally, move disks 1 and 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3.\n\n### Sequence of Moves:\n\n1. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n2. Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\n3. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n4. Move disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n5. Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n6. Move disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n7. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n8. Move disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n9. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n10. Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n11. Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\n12. Move disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n13. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n14. Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n15. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe sequence of moves to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 disks and 4 pegs is:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n>>>"
