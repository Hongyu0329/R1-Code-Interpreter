    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 disks and 3 pegs, we need to move all disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2 following the rules provided. The solution involves a recursive approach, where we break down the problem into smaller sub-problems.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We have 4 disks on Peg 3.\n   - We need to move all disks to Peg 2.\n   - We can use Peg 1 as an auxiliary peg.\n   - We must follow the rules: move one disk at a time, never place a larger disk on a smaller one, and all disks must be on a peg.\n\n2. **Recursive Strategy:**\n   - Move the top 3 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1 using Peg 2 as auxiliary.\n   - Move the largest disk (Disk 4) from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n   - Move the 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 using Peg 3 as auxiliary.\n\n3. **Break Down the Moves:**\n   - **Move 3 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1:**\n     - Move 2 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2 using Peg 1 as auxiliary.\n     - Move Disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1.\n     - Move 2 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1 using Peg 3 as auxiliary.\n   - **Move Disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2.**\n   - **Move 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2:**\n     - Move 2 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3 using Peg 2 as auxiliary.\n     - Move Disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n     - Move 2 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2 using Peg 1 as auxiliary.\n\n4. **Detailed Moves:**\n   - Move Disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n   - Move Disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n   - Move Disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n   - Move Disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n   - Move Disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n   - Move Disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n   - Move Disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n   - Move Disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n   - Move Disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n   - Move Disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n   - Move Disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n   - Move Disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n   - Move Disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n   - Move Disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n   - Move Disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe sequence of moves to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2 is:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n>>>"
