    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks and 3 pegs, where the disks need to be moved from Peg 2 to Peg 3, we need to follow the rules of the game carefully. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Initial Setup:**\n   - We have 3 disks on Peg 2, labeled from smallest (1) to largest (3).\n   - Our goal is to move all disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n\n2. **Identify the Pegs:**\n   - Peg 1 will be used as an auxiliary peg to help move the disks.\n\n3. **Plan the Moves:**\n   - The strategy involves moving smaller subsets of disks to the auxiliary peg, then moving the largest disk directly to the destination peg, and finally moving the smaller disks on top of the largest disk.\n\n4. **Execute the Moves:**\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1.\n   - Move disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that all disks are moved from Peg 2 to Peg 3 while adhering to the rules of the Tower of Hanoi.\n\nThe sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \n>>>"
