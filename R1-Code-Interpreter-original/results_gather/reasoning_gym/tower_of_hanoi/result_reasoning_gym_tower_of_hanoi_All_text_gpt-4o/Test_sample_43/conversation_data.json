    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 6 disks and 4 pegs, we can use the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is a generalization of the classic three-peg problem. The algorithm involves breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and using an additional peg to facilitate the transfer of disks.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the solution:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have 6 disks on Peg 4, and we need to move them to Peg 1 using Pegs 2 and 3 as auxiliary pegs.\n\n2. **Divide the Problem**: The Frame-Stewart algorithm suggests dividing the disks into two groups. For 6 disks, a common strategy is to move the top 3 disks to an auxiliary peg, then move the remaining 3 disks directly to the destination peg, and finally move the 3 disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.\n\n3. **Move Top 3 Disks**: \n   - Move the top 3 disks from Peg 4 to Peg 2 using Pegs 1 and 3 as auxiliary pegs.\n\n4. **Move Remaining 3 Disks**:\n   - Move the remaining 3 disks from Peg 4 to Peg 1 using Pegs 3 and 2 as auxiliary pegs.\n\n5. **Move Top 3 Disks to Destination**:\n   - Move the 3 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1 using Pegs 4 and 3 as auxiliary pegs.\n\nFollowing these steps, we can derive the sequence of moves:\n\n1. Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n2. Move disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\n3. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n4. Move disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n5. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n6. Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n7. Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n8. Move disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n9. Move disk 5 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\n10. Move disk 6 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n11. Move disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n12. Move disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n13. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n14. Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n15. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n16. Move disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n17. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n18. Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n19. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n\nThe sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 6 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n>>>"
