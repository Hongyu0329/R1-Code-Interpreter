    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks and 4 pegs, we can use the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is a generalization of the classic three-peg solution. The algorithm involves breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems, moving a subset of disks to an auxiliary peg, then moving the remaining disks directly to the target peg, and finally moving the subset from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have 7 disks on Peg 1, and we need to move them to Peg 4 using Pegs 2 and 3 as auxiliary pegs.\n\n2. **Divide the Problem**: Choose a number `k` such that we first move the top `k` disks to an auxiliary peg, then move the remaining `n-k` disks directly to the target peg, and finally move the `k` disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\n3. **Optimal Substructure**: For 7 disks, a common choice is to move the top 4 disks to an auxiliary peg, then move the remaining 3 disks directly to the target peg, and finally move the 4 disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\n4. **Recursive Solution**:\n   - Move the top 4 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 using Pegs 3 and 4.\n   - Move the remaining 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 4 using Pegs 3 and 2.\n   - Move the 4 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 4 using Pegs 1 and 3.\n\n5. **Execution**:\n   - **Move 4 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2**:\n     - Move 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3 using Pegs 2 and 4.\n     - Move disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n     - Move 3 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2 using Pegs 1 and 4.\n   - **Move 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 4**:\n     - Move 2 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3 using Pegs 2 and 4.\n     - Move disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 4.\n     - Move 2 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 4 using Pegs 1 and 2.\n   - **Move 4 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 4**:\n     - Move 3 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1 using Pegs 3 and 4.\n     - Move disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 4.\n     - Move 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 4 using Pegs 2 and 3.\n\nFollowing these steps, the sequence of moves is:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 6 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 5 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 7 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 6 from Peg 2 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to"
