    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks and 4 pegs, we need to carefully consider the rules and the additional peg available. The goal is to move all disks from Peg 2 to Peg 4, using Pegs 1 and 3 as auxiliary pegs. The additional peg allows for potentially fewer moves than the classic 3-peg version.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: \n   - Disks are on Peg 2 in the order: Disk 3 (bottom), Disk 2 (middle), Disk 1 (top).\n\n2. **Objective**: \n   - Move all disks to Peg 4.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Use the additional peg to temporarily hold disks, allowing for more flexibility in moving larger disks.\n\n4. **Move Sequence**:\n   - Move Disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n   - Move Disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n   - Move Disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3 (now Disk 1 is on top of Disk 2 on Peg 3).\n   - Move Disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 4.\n   - Move Disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n   - Move Disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4 (now Disk 2 is on top of Disk 3 on Peg 4).\n   - Move Disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4 (now all disks are on Peg 4 in the correct order).\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4  \n>>>"
