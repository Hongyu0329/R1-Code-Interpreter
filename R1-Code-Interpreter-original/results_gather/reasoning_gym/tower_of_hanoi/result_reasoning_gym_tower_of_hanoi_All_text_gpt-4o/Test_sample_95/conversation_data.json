    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks and 3 pegs, we need to move all disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3 while following the rules provided. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the disks**: We have three disks, which we can label as Disk 1 (smallest), Disk 2 (medium), and Disk 3 (largest).\n\n2. **Understand the goal**: Move all disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n\n3. **Apply the rules**:\n   - Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n   - A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.\n   - All disks must be on a peg at all times.\n\n4. **Plan the sequence of moves**:\n   - Move Disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n   - Move Disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n   - Move Disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2 (placing it on top of Disk 2).\n   - Move Disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n   - Move Disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n   - Move Disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3 (placing it on top of Disk 3).\n   - Move Disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3 (placing it on top of Disk 2).\n\n5. **Sequence of moves**:\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n   - Move disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that all disks are moved from Peg 1 to Peg 3 while adhering to the rules.\n\nFinal answer:\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n>>>"
