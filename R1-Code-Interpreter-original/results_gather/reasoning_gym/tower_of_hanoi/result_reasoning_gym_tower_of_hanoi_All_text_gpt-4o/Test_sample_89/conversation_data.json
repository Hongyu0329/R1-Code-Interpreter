    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks and 3 pegs, where the goal is to move all disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2, we need to follow the rules and carefully plan each move. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Initial Setup:**\n   - Disks are initially on Peg 3.\n   - Peg 1 is the auxiliary peg.\n   - Peg 2 is the destination peg.\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move all disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n\n3. **Rules Recap:**\n   - Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n   - A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.\n   - All disks must be on a peg at all times.\n\n4. **Strategy:**\n   - Use Peg 1 as an auxiliary peg to facilitate the movement of disks.\n   - Move the smaller disks first to free up the larger disks.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1.\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n   - Move disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n\nBy following these steps, all disks are successfully moved from Peg 3 to Peg 2, adhering to the rules of the Tower of Hanoi.\n\nThe sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \n>>>"
