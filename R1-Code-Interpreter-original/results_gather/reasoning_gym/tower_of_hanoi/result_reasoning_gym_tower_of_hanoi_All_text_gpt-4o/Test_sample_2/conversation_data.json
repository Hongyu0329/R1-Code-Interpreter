    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks and 4 pegs, we can use the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is a generalization of the classic three-peg problem. The algorithm involves breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems, moving a subset of disks to an auxiliary peg, then moving the remaining disks directly to the target peg, and finally moving the subset of disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis and solution:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have 7 disks on Peg 1, and we need to move them to Peg 4 using Pegs 2 and 3 as auxiliary pegs.\n\n2. **Divide the Problem**: Choose a number `k` such that we first move the top `k` disks to an auxiliary peg, then move the remaining `7-k` disks directly to the target peg, and finally move the `k` disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\n3. **Optimal Subdivision**: For 7 disks and 4 pegs, a common choice is to move the top 4 disks to an auxiliary peg, then move the remaining 3 disks directly to the target peg, and finally move the 4 disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\n4. **Move the Top 4 Disks**: Use Pegs 1, 3, and 4 to move the top 4 disks to Peg 2.\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n   - Move disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n   - Move disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n\n5. **Move the Remaining 3 Disks**: Move the remaining 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 4 using Pegs 3 and 2.\n   - Move disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\n   - Move disk 6 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 5 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 7 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\n   - Move disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n   - Move disk 6 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n   - Move disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\n\n6. **Move the 4 Disks from Peg 2 to Peg 4**: Use Pegs 1, 3, and 4 to move the 4 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 4.\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n   - Move disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n   - Move disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n\nThe sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 6 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 7 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 6 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n>>>"
