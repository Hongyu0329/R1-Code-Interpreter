    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 5 disks and 3 pegs, we need to move all disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2 following the rules provided. The solution involves a recursive approach where we break down the problem into smaller sub-problems. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We have 5 disks on Peg 3, and we need to move them to Peg 2 using Peg 1 as an auxiliary peg. The disks are numbered from 1 (smallest) to 5 (largest).\n\n2. **Recursive Strategy**: \n   - Move the top 4 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1 using Peg 2 as auxiliary.\n   - Move the 5th disk (largest) from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n   - Move the 4 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 using Peg 3 as auxiliary.\n\n3. **Base Case**: If there is only one disk, move it directly to the target peg.\n\n4. **Recursive Steps**:\n   - For `n` disks, move `n-1` disks to the auxiliary peg.\n   - Move the `nth` disk to the target peg.\n   - Move the `n-1` disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\n5. **Execution**: Follow the recursive steps to generate the sequence of moves.\n\nNow, let's list the sequence of moves for 5 disks:\n\n1. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n2. Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n3. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n4. Move disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n5. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n6. Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n7. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n8. Move disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n9. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n10. Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n11. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n12. Move disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n13. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n14. Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n15. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n16. Move disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n17. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n18. Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n19. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n20. Move disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n21. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n22. Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n23. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n24. Move disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n25. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n26. Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n27. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n28. Move disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n29. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n30. Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n31. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n\nThe sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n>>>"
