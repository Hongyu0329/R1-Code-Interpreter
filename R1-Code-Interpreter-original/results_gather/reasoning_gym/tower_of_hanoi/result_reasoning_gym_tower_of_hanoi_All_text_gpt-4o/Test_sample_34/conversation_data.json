    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks and 4 pegs, we need to carefully consider the rules and the additional peg available. The goal is to move all disks from Peg 4 to Peg 1, using Pegs 2 and 3 as auxiliary pegs. The additional peg allows for more flexibility and potentially fewer moves than the classic 3-peg problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: \n   - Disks are on Peg 4 in the order: Disk 3 (largest), Disk 2, Disk 1 (smallest).\n\n2. **Objective**: \n   - Move all disks to Peg 1.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Use the additional peg to temporarily hold disks, allowing for more efficient movement.\n   - Move smaller groups of disks to auxiliary pegs to free up larger disks.\n\n4. **Execution**:\n   - Move Disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1.\n   - Move Disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2.\n   - Move Disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2 (on top of Disk 2).\n   - Move Disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 1.\n   - Move Disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4.\n   - Move Disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1 (on top of Disk 3).\n   - Move Disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1 (on top of Disk 2).\n\n### Sequence of Moves:\n\nFollowing the above strategy, the sequence of moves is:\n\n1. Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n2. Move disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n3. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n4. Move disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n5. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n6. Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n7. Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \n>>>"
