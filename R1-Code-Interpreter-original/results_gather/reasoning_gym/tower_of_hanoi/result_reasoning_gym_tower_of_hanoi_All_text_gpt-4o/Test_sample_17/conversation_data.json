    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks and 4 pegs, we need to carefully plan the sequence of moves while adhering to the rules. The additional peg allows for potentially fewer moves compared to the classic 3-peg problem. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: \n   - Disks are on Peg 4 in the order: Disk 3 (largest) at the bottom, Disk 2 in the middle, and Disk 1 (smallest) on top.\n\n2. **Objective**: \n   - Move all disks from Peg 4 to Peg 1.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Use the extra pegs to temporarily hold disks, allowing for more flexibility in moving larger disks.\n\n4. **Steps**:\n   - Move Disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1.\n   - Move Disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2.\n   - Move Disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2 (placing it on top of Disk 2).\n   - Move Disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 1.\n   - Move Disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4.\n   - Move Disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1 (placing it on top of Disk 3).\n   - Move Disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1 (placing it on top of Disk 2).\n\nBy following these steps, all disks are moved from Peg 4 to Peg 1 in the correct order.\n\nThe sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \n>>>"
