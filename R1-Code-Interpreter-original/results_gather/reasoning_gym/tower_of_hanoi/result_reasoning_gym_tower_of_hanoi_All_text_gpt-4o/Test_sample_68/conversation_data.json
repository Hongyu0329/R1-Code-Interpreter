    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 disks and 4 pegs, we need to carefully consider the rules and the additional peg available. The classic Tower of Hanoi problem is typically solved with 3 pegs, but with 4 pegs, we can use the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is more efficient for this scenario.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We have 4 disks labeled from 1 (smallest) to 4 (largest).\n   - We need to move all disks from Peg 4 to Peg 1.\n   - We have 4 pegs available: Peg 1, Peg 2, Peg 3, and Peg 4.\n   - We can only move one disk at a time.\n   - A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.\n\n2. **Frame-Stewart Algorithm:**\n   - This algorithm is used for solving the Tower of Hanoi problem with more than 3 pegs.\n   - The idea is to divide the problem into smaller subproblems, using the extra peg(s) to reduce the number of moves.\n\n3. **Divide the Problem:**\n   - Move the top 2 disks to an auxiliary peg (Peg 2) using Peg 1 and Peg 3 as intermediate pegs.\n   - Move the remaining 2 disks directly to the destination peg (Peg 1).\n   - Move the 2 disks from the auxiliary peg (Peg 2) to the destination peg (Peg 1).\n\n4. **Execute the Moves:**\n   - Follow the sequence of moves to achieve the goal.\n\n### Sequence of Moves:\n\n1. Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n2. Move disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\n3. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n4. Move disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n5. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n6. Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n7. Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n8. Move disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n9. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n10. Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n11. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n12. Move disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n13. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n14. Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n15. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n\nBy following these steps, we successfully move all disks from Peg 4 to Peg 1 using the additional peg to optimize the process.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n>>>"
