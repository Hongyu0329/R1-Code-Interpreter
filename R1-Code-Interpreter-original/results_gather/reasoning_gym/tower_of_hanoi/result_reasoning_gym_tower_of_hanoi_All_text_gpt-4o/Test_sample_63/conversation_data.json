    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks and 3 pegs, we need to move all disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1 while following the rules. The solution involves a recursive approach where we break down the problem into smaller subproblems. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We have 7 disks on Peg 2, and we need to move them to Peg 1 using Peg 3 as an auxiliary peg. The rules are:\n   - Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n   - A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.\n   - All disks must be on a peg at all times.\n\n2. **Recursive Strategy**: The strategy for solving the Tower of Hanoi problem is to recursively move the top n-1 disks to the auxiliary peg, move the nth disk to the target peg, and then move the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\n3. **Base Case**: If there is only one disk, simply move it from the source peg to the target peg.\n\n4. **Recursive Case**: For n disks:\n   - Move the top n-1 disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg.\n   - Move the nth disk from the source peg to the target peg.\n   - Move the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\n5. **Apply the Strategy**: We will apply this recursive strategy to move 7 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1 using Peg 3 as the auxiliary peg.\n\nLet's outline the sequence of moves:\n\n- Move 6 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3 using Peg 1 as auxiliary.\n- Move disk 7 from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n- Move 6 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1 using Peg 2 as auxiliary.\n\nNow, let's list the sequence of moves:\n\n```\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 6 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 7 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 6 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg "
