    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks and 4 pegs, we can utilize the additional peg to potentially reduce the number of moves compared to the classic 3-peg problem. The goal is to move all disks from Peg 4 to Peg 2 while following the rules.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: \n   - Peg 4: Disks 1, 2, 3 (from top to bottom)\n   - Peg 2: Empty\n   - Peg 1 and Peg 3: Empty\n\n2. **Objective**: Move all disks from Peg 4 to Peg 2.\n\n3. **Strategy**: Use Peg 1 and Peg 3 as auxiliary pegs to facilitate the movement of disks.\n\n4. **Steps**:\n   - Move Disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1.\n   - Move Disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3.\n   - Move Disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3 (now Disk 1 is on top of Disk 2 on Peg 3).\n   - Move Disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 2.\n   - Move Disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4.\n   - Move Disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2 (now Disk 2 is on Peg 2).\n   - Move Disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2 (now all disks are on Peg 2 in the correct order).\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that all disks are moved from Peg 4 to Peg 2 while adhering to the rules.\n\nThe sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2  \n>>>"
