    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 disks and 4 pegs, we need to carefully plan the sequence of moves to transfer all disks from Peg 3 to Peg 4 while adhering to the rules. The presence of an extra peg allows for a more efficient solution than the classic 3-peg problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - Disks are initially on Peg 3 in the order: Disk 4 (bottom), Disk 3, Disk 2, Disk 1 (top).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Move all disks from Peg 3 to Peg 4.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Use the extra peg (Peg 1 or Peg 2) to temporarily hold disks, allowing for more flexibility in moving larger disks.\n\n4. **Execution:**\n   - Move smaller groups of disks to intermediate pegs to free up larger disks.\n   - Use the extra peg to facilitate the movement of larger disks directly to the destination peg.\n\n### Sequence of Moves:\n\n1. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n2. Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n3. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n4. Move disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n5. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n6. Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n7. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n8. Move disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n9. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n10. Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\n11. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n12. Move disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n13. Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n14. Move disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n15. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n16. Move disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\n17. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n18. Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n19. Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n20. Move disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n21. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n22. Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\n23. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n24. Move disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n\nBy following these steps, all disks are successfully moved from Peg 3 to Peg 4.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n>>>"
