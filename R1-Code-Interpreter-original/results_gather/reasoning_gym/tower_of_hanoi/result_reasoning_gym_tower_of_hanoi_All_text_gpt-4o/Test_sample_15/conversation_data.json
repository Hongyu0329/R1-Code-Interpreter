    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 5 disks and 3 pegs, we need to move all disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3 following the rules provided. The solution involves a recursive approach where we break down the problem into smaller sub-problems. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We have 5 disks on Peg 2, and we need to move them to Peg 3 using Peg 1 as an auxiliary peg.\n\n2. **Recursive Strategy**: \n   - Move the top 4 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1 using Peg 3 as auxiliary.\n   - Move the 5th disk (largest) directly from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n   - Move the 4 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3 using Peg 2 as auxiliary.\n\n3. **Base Case**: If there is only one disk, move it directly to the target peg.\n\n4. **Recursive Steps**:\n   - For `n` disks, move `n-1` disks to the auxiliary peg, move the `nth` disk to the target peg, and then move the `n-1` disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\n5. **Execution**:\n   - Move 4 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n   - Move disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n   - Move 4 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n\nLet's break down the moves:\n\n**Move 4 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1**:\n- Move 3 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n- Move disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n- Move 3 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1.\n\n**Move 3 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3**:\n- Move 2 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n- Move disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n- Move 2 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n\n**Move 2 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1**:\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n- Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1.\n\n**Move 2 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1**:\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n- Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1.\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n\n**Move 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3**:\n- Move 2 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n- Move disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n- Move 2 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n\n**Move 2 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2**:\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n- Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n\n**Move 2 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3**:\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n- Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n\nNow, let's compile the sequence of moves:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \n>>>"
