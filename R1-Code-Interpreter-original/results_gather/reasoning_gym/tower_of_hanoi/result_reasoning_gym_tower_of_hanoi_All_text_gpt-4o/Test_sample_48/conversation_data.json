    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 5 disks and 4 pegs, we can use the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is a generalization of the classic three-peg problem. The algorithm involves breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems, moving a subset of disks to an auxiliary peg, and then moving the remaining disks directly to the target peg.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have 5 disks on Peg 4, and we need to move them to Peg 2 using Pegs 1 and 3 as auxiliary pegs.\n\n2. **Divide the Problem**: Choose a number `k` such that we move the top `k` disks to an auxiliary peg, then move the remaining `n-k` disks directly to the target peg, and finally move the `k` disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\n3. **Optimal Subdivision**: For 5 disks and 4 pegs, a common strategy is to move the top 3 disks to an auxiliary peg, then move the remaining 2 disks directly to the target peg, and finally move the 3 disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\n4. **Execution**:\n   - Move the top 3 disks from Peg 4 to Peg 1 using Pegs 2 and 3.\n   - Move the remaining 2 disks from Peg 4 to Peg 2 using Peg 3.\n   - Move the 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 using Pegs 3 and 4.\n\n5. **Detailed Moves**:\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n   - Move disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n   - Move disk 5 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n   - Move disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that all disks are moved from Peg 4 to Peg 2 while adhering to the rules of the Tower of Hanoi.\n\nThe sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 5 from Peg 4 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \n>>>"
