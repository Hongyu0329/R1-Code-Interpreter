    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks and 4 pegs, we can use the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is a generalization of the classic three-peg solution. The Frame-Stewart algorithm involves breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems, moving a subset of disks to an auxiliary peg, and then moving the remaining disks directly to the target peg.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have 7 disks on Peg 2, and we need to move them to Peg 3 using Pegs 1 and 4 as auxiliary pegs.\n\n2. **Divide the Problem**: Choose a number `k` such that `1 <= k < 7`. A common choice is to move `k = 4` disks to an auxiliary peg, then move the remaining `7 - k = 3` disks directly to the target peg, and finally move the `k` disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\n3. **Move 4 Disks to an Auxiliary Peg**: Move the top 4 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1 using Pegs 3 and 4 as auxiliary pegs.\n\n4. **Move Remaining 3 Disks to Target Peg**: Move the remaining 3 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3 using Pegs 4 and 1 as auxiliary pegs.\n\n5. **Move 4 Disks from Auxiliary Peg to Target Peg**: Move the 4 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3 using Pegs 2 and 4 as auxiliary pegs.\n\nNow, let's detail the sequence of moves:\n\n- **Move 4 Disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1**:\n  1. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n  2. Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n  3. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n  4. Move disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n  5. Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n  6. Move disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\n  7. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n  8. Move disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n  9. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n  10. Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n  11. Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n  12. Move disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n  13. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n  14. Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n  15. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n\n- **Move 3 Disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3**:\n  16. Move disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n  17. Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n  18. Move disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\n  19. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n  20. Move disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n  21. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n  22. Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n  23. Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n  24. Move disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\n  25. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n  26. Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n  27. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n  28. Move disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n  29. Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n  30. Move disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\n  31. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n\n- **Move 4 Disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3**:\n  32. Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n  33. Move disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\n  34. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n  35. Move disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n  36. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n  37. Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n  38. Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n  39. Move disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n  40. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n  41. Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n  42. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n  43. Move disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n  44. Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n  45. Move disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\n  46.
