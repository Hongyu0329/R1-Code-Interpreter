    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 disks and 3 pegs, we need to move all disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3 following the rules provided. The strategy involves using Peg 1 as an auxiliary peg. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Move the top 3 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1**, using Peg 3 as an auxiliary peg.\n2. **Move the largest disk (Disk 4) from Peg 2 to Peg 3**.\n3. **Move the 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3**, using Peg 2 as an auxiliary peg.\n\nLet's break down these steps further:\n\n### Step 1: Move 3 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n- Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n- Move disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n- Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n\n### Step 2: Move disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n- Move disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n\n### Step 3: Move 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n- Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n- Move disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n- Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n\nNow, let's compile the sequence of moves:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \n>>>"
