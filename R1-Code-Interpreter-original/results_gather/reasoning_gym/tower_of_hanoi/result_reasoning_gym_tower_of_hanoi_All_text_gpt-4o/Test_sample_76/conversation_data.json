    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 disks and 3 pegs, we need to move all disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2 following the rules provided. The strategy involves using Peg 1 as an auxiliary peg. The solution can be broken down into smaller subproblems, where we move smaller groups of disks to achieve the final goal.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Move 3 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1** (using Peg 2 as auxiliary):\n   - Move 2 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2 (using Peg 1 as auxiliary):\n     - Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n     - Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n     - Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n   - Move disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n   - Move 2 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1 (using Peg 3 as auxiliary):\n     - Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n     - Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n     - Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n\n2. **Move disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2**.\n\n3. **Move 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2** (using Peg 3 as auxiliary):\n   - Move 2 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3 (using Peg 2 as auxiliary):\n     - Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n     - Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n     - Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n   - Move 2 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2 (using Peg 1 as auxiliary):\n     - Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n     - Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n     - Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n\n### Sequence of Moves:\n\nFollowing the above steps, the sequence of moves is:\n\n1. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n2. Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n3. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n4. Move disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n5. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n6. Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n7. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n8. Move disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n9. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n10. Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n11. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n12. Move disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n13. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n14. Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n15. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n>>>"
