    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 5 disks and 4 pegs, we need to carefully plan the sequence of moves to transfer all disks from Peg 4 to Peg 2 while adhering to the rules. The presence of an extra peg allows for more efficient solutions compared to the classic 3-peg problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We have 5 disks, labeled from 1 (smallest) to 5 (largest).\n   - We need to move all disks from Peg 4 to Peg 2.\n   - We have 4 pegs available: Peg 1, Peg 2, Peg 3, and Peg 4.\n\n2. **Rules Recap:**\n   - Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n   - A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.\n   - All disks must be on a peg at all times.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Use the extra peg to temporarily hold disks and facilitate the movement.\n   - Break down the problem into smaller sub-problems, moving smaller groups of disks to intermediate pegs before reaching the final destination.\n\n4. **Plan the Moves:**\n   - Move the top 3 disks (1, 2, 3) from Peg 4 to Peg 1 using Pegs 2 and 3 as intermediates.\n   - Move the remaining 2 disks (4, 5) from Peg 4 to Peg 2 using Peg 3 as an intermediate.\n   - Finally, move the 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n\n5. **Execute the Moves:**\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n   - Move disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n   - Move disk 5 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n   - Move disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n   - Move disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that all disks are moved from Peg 4 to Peg 2 in compliance with the rules.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 5 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n>>>\n```"
