    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks and 3 pegs, we need to follow a recursive strategy. The goal is to move all disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 using Peg 3 as an auxiliary peg. The process involves moving smaller subsets of disks recursively until the entire stack is transferred.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the recursive solution:\n\n1. **Move the top 6 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3**, using Peg 2 as an auxiliary peg.\n2. **Move the 7th disk (largest) from Peg 1 to Peg 2**.\n3. **Move the 6 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2**, using Peg 1 as an auxiliary peg.\n\nLet's break down these steps into the sequence of moves:\n\n### Step 1: Move 6 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n- Move 5 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2, using Peg 3 as auxiliary.\n- Move disk 6 from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n- Move 5 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3, using Peg 1 as auxiliary.\n\n### Step 2: Move disk 7 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n\n### Step 3: Move 6 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n- Move 5 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1, using Peg 2 as auxiliary.\n- Move disk 6 from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n- Move 5 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2, using Peg 3 as auxiliary.\n\nNow, let's list the sequence of moves:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2
