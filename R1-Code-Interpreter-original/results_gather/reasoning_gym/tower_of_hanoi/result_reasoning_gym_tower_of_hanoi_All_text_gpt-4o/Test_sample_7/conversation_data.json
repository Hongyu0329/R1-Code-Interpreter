    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 disks and 4 pegs, we need to carefully consider the rules and the additional peg available. The classic Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 pegs has a well-known recursive solution, but with 4 pegs, we can use the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is more efficient.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We have 4 disks of different sizes, initially stacked on Peg 4. The goal is to move all disks to Peg 1, using Pegs 2 and 3 as auxiliary pegs, while following the rules.\n\n2. **Frame-Stewart Algorithm**: This algorithm suggests breaking the problem into smaller subproblems. For 4 disks and 4 pegs, the optimal strategy involves moving a subset of disks to an auxiliary peg, moving the remaining disks directly to the destination peg, and then moving the subset from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.\n\n3. **Determine the Subset**: For 4 disks, a common strategy is to move the top 2 disks to an auxiliary peg, then move the remaining 2 disks directly to the destination peg, and finally move the 2 disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.\n\n4. **Execute the Moves**:\n   - Move the top 2 disks from Peg 4 to Peg 2.\n   - Move the remaining 2 disks from Peg 4 to Peg 1.\n   - Move the 2 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n\n5. **Detail the Moves**:\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2.\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3.\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n   - Move disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 1.\n   - Move disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 1.\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4.\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1.\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1.\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that all disks are moved from Peg 4 to Peg 1, adhering to the rules.\n\nThe sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \n>>>"
