    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 disks and 4 pegs, we need to carefully plan the sequence of moves to transfer all disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1, while adhering to the rules. The presence of an extra peg allows for a more efficient solution than the classic 3-peg problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - Disks are initially on Peg 3, and we need to move them to Peg 1.\n   - Pegs available: Peg 2 and Peg 4 as auxiliary pegs.\n\n2. **Strategy:**\n   - Use the extra peg to temporarily hold disks, allowing for more flexibility.\n   - Move smaller groups of disks to auxiliary pegs to free up larger disks.\n\n3. **Move Sequence:**\n   - Move the smallest disk (Disk 1) to Peg 1.\n   - Move the second smallest disk (Disk 2) to Peg 2.\n   - Move Disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2 (on top of Disk 2).\n   - Move the third smallest disk (Disk 3) to Peg 1.\n   - Move Disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n   - Move Disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1 (on top of Disk 3).\n   - Move Disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1 (on top of Disk 2).\n   - Move the largest disk (Disk 4) to Peg 4.\n   - Move Disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n   - Move Disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4 (on top of Disk 4).\n   - Move Disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4 (on top of Disk 2).\n   - Move Disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n   - Move Disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1.\n   - Move Disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2 (on top of Disk 3).\n   - Move Disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2 (on top of Disk 2).\n   - Move Disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 1.\n   - Move Disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n   - Move Disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1 (on top of Disk 4).\n   - Move Disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1 (on top of Disk 2).\n   - Move Disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 4.\n   - Move Disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n   - Move Disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4 (on top of Disk 3).\n   - Move Disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4 (on top of Disk 2).\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 4  \n>>>"
