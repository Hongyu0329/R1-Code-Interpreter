    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 disks and 4 pegs, we need to carefully plan the sequence of moves to transfer all disks from Peg 4 to Peg 1 while adhering to the rules. The presence of an extra peg allows for a more efficient solution than the classic 3-peg problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: \n   - Disks are initially on Peg 4, ordered from largest (Disk 4) at the bottom to smallest (Disk 1) at the top.\n\n2. **Objective**: \n   - Move all disks to Peg 1.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Use the extra peg to temporarily hold disks, allowing for more flexibility in moving larger disks.\n   - Break down the problem into smaller sub-problems, moving smaller groups of disks to intermediate pegs before finally moving them to the destination peg.\n\n4. **Execution**:\n   - Move the top 2 disks (Disk 1 and Disk 2) to Peg 2.\n   - Move Disk 3 to Peg 3.\n   - Move Disk 1 and Disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n   - Move Disk 4 to Peg 1.\n   - Move Disk 1 and Disk 2 to Peg 3.\n   - Move Disk 3 to Peg 1.\n   - Finally, move Disk 1 and Disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1.\n\n### Sequence of Moves:\n\n1. Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n2. Move disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\n3. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n4. Move disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n5. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n6. Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n7. Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n8. Move disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n9. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n10. Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n11. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n12. Move disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n13. Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n14. Move disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n15. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n\nBy following these steps, all disks are successfully moved from Peg 4 to Peg 1.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n>>>"
