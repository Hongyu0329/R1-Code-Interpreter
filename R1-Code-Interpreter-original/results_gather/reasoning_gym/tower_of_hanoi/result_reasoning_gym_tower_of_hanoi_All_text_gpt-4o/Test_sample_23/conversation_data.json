    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 3 disks and 3 pegs, we need to move all disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 while following the rules provided. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the disks**: We have 3 disks, which we will label as Disk 1 (smallest), Disk 2 (medium), and Disk 3 (largest).\n\n2. **Initial setup**: All disks are initially on Peg 1, and we need to move them to Peg 2.\n\n3. **Objective**: Move all disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 using Peg 3 as an auxiliary peg.\n\n4. **Rules to follow**:\n   - Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n   - A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.\n   - All disks must be on a peg at all times.\n\n5. **Step-by-step solution**:\n   - Move Disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n   - Move Disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n   - Move Disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n   - Move Disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n   - Move Disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n   - Move Disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n   - Move Disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n   - Move Disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n   - Move Disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n   - Move Disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1.\n   - Move Disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n   - Move Disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n   - Move Disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n\nBy following these steps, all disks will be moved from Peg 1 to Peg 2 in the correct order.\n\nThe sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n>>>"
