    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 5 disks and 3 pegs, we need to follow a recursive approach. The goal is to move all disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 using Peg 3 as an auxiliary peg. The rules are that only one disk can be moved at a time, a larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk, and all disks must be on a peg at all times.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Move the top 4 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3**, using Peg 2 as an auxiliary peg.\n2. **Move the 5th disk (largest) from Peg 1 to Peg 2**.\n3. **Move the 4 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2**, using Peg 1 as an auxiliary peg.\n\nLet's break down these steps further:\n\n### Step 1: Move 4 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n- Move 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2, using Peg 3 as auxiliary.\n- Move disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n- Move 3 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3, using Peg 1 as auxiliary.\n\n#### Sub-step 1.1: Move 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n- Move 2 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3, using Peg 2 as auxiliary.\n- Move disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n- Move 2 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2, using Peg 1 as auxiliary.\n\n##### Sub-step 1.1.1: Move 2 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n- Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n\n##### Sub-step 1.1.3: Move 2 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1.\n- Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n\n#### Sub-step 1.3: Move 3 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n- Move 2 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1, using Peg 3 as auxiliary.\n- Move disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n- Move 2 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3, using Peg 2 as auxiliary.\n\n##### Sub-step 1.3.1: Move 2 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n- Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1.\n\n##### Sub-step 1.3.3: Move 2 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n- Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n\n### Step 2: Move disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n\n### Step 3: Move 4 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n- Move 3 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1, using Peg 2 as auxiliary.\n- Move disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n- Move 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2, using Peg 3 as auxiliary.\n\n#### Sub-step 3.1: Move 3 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n- Move 2 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2, using Peg 1 as auxiliary.\n- Move disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1.\n- Move 2 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1, using Peg 3 as auxiliary.\n\n##### Sub-step 3.1.1: Move 2 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1.\n- Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n\n##### Sub-step 3.1.3: Move 2 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n- Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1.\n\n#### Sub-step 3.3: Move 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n- Move 2 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3, using Peg 2 as auxiliary.\n- Move disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n- Move 2 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2, using Peg 1 as auxiliary.\n\n##### Sub-step 3.3.1: Move 2 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n- Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n\n##### Sub-step 3.3.3: Move 2 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1.\n- Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2.\n- Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2.\n\nNow, let's compile the sequence of moves:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n>>>\n"
