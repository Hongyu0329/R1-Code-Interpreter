    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 5 disks and 4 pegs, we can use the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is a generalization of the classic Tower of Hanoi problem for more than three pegs. The algorithm involves breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and using an additional peg to facilitate the transfer of disks.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - We have 5 disks on Peg 4, and we need to move them to Peg 1 using Pegs 2 and 3 as auxiliary pegs.\n\n2. **Divide the Problem:**\n   - Choose a number `k` such that we move the top `k` disks to an auxiliary peg, then move the remaining disks directly to the destination peg, and finally move the `k` disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.\n\n3. **Optimal Subdivision:**\n   - For 5 disks and 4 pegs, a common strategy is to move the top 3 disks to an auxiliary peg, then move the remaining 2 disks directly to the destination peg, and finally move the 3 disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.\n\n4. **Execution:**\n   - Move the top 3 disks from Peg 4 to Peg 2 using Pegs 1 and 3 as auxiliary pegs.\n   - Move the remaining 2 disks from Peg 4 to Peg 1 using Peg 3 as an auxiliary peg.\n   - Move the 3 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1 using Pegs 3 and 4 as auxiliary pegs.\n\n### Sequence of Moves:\n\n1. **Move 3 Disks from Peg 4 to Peg 2:**\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n\n2. **Move 2 Disks from Peg 4 to Peg 1:**\n   - Move disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n   - Move disk 5 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n\n3. **Move 3 Disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1:**\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\n   - Move disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\n   - Move disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\n   - Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n\nBy following these steps, we can successfully move all 5 disks from Peg 4 to Peg 1 using 4 pegs.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 5 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \n>>>"
