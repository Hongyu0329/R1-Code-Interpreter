    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 disks and 3 pegs, we need to move all disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3 following the rules provided. The process involves breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems and solving them step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We have 4 disks on Peg 2, and we need to move them to Peg 3.\n   - We can use Peg 1 as an auxiliary peg.\n   - We must follow the rules: move one disk at a time, never place a larger disk on a smaller one, and keep all disks on pegs.\n\n2. **Recursive Strategy:**\n   - The Tower of Hanoi problem is typically solved using a recursive approach.\n   - The strategy involves moving the top n-1 disks to an auxiliary peg, moving the nth disk to the target peg, and then moving the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\n3. **Break Down the Moves:**\n   - Move the top 3 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1 using Peg 3 as auxiliary.\n   - Move the 4th disk (largest) from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n   - Move the 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3 using Peg 2 as auxiliary.\n\n4. **Execute the Moves:**\n   - Follow the recursive breakdown to list each move.\n\n### Sequence of Moves:\n\n1. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n2. Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n3. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n4. Move disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n5. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n6. Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n7. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n8. Move disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n9. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n10. Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n11. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n12. Move disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n13. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n14. Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n15. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n16. Move disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n17. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n18. Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n19. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n20. Move disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n21. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n22. Move disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\n23. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n24. Move disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n25. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n26. Move disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n27. Move disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\n28. Move disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n29. Move disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\n30. Move disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n31. Move disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n\nThe final sequence of moves is as follows:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n>>>"
