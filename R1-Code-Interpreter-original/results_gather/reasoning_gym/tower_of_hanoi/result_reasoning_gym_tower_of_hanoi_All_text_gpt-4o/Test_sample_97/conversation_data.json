    "The Tower of Hanoi problem with 4 pegs is a more complex version of the classic 3-peg problem. The goal is to move all disks from the source peg to the target peg using the additional peg(s) to facilitate the process. The Frame-Stewart algorithm is a well-known approach to solve this problem optimally.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We have 7 disks and 4 pegs.\n   - The objective is to move all disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n   - We can use Peg 2 and Peg 4 as auxiliary pegs.\n\n2. **Frame-Stewart Algorithm:**\n   - This algorithm suggests breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems.\n   - For 7 disks, choose an integer `k` (1 â‰¤ k < 7) to divide the disks into two groups: the top `k` disks and the remaining `7-k` disks.\n   - Move the top `k` disks to an auxiliary peg using all 4 pegs.\n   - Move the remaining `7-k` disks directly to the target peg using 3 pegs.\n   - Finally, move the `k` disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg using all 4 pegs.\n\n3. **Choosing `k`:**\n   - For 7 disks, a common choice is `k = 4`. This choice balances the number of moves required for each subproblem.\n\n4. **Execute the Moves:**\n   - Move the top 4 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 using all 4 pegs.\n   - Move the remaining 3 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3 using Pegs 1, 3, and 4.\n   - Move the 4 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3 using all 4 pegs.\n\n5. **Sequence of Moves:**\n   - Follow the Frame-Stewart algorithm to generate the sequence of moves.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe sequence of moves to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks and 4 pegs is as follows:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 6 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 7 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 6 from Peg 3 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3  \nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4  \nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 1  \nMove disk 1"
