    "The Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks and 4 pegs is a more complex version of the classic problem, which typically involves 3 pegs. The addition of a fourth peg allows for more efficient solutions, but it also requires careful planning to minimize the number of moves.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the Frame-Stewart algorithm, which is a known method for solving the Tower of Hanoi with more than three pegs. The algorithm involves breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems, moving a subset of disks to an auxiliary peg, and then moving the remaining disks directly to the target peg.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the solution:\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: We have 7 disks on Peg 2, and we need to move them to Peg 3 using Pegs 1 and 4 as auxiliary pegs.\n\n2. **Divide the Problem**: Choose a number `k` such that `1 <= k < 7`. A common choice is `k = 4`, which means we will first move the top 4 disks to an auxiliary peg, then move the remaining 3 disks directly to the target peg, and finally move the 4 disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg.\n\n3. **Move the Top 4 Disks**: Move the top 4 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1 using Pegs 3 and 4 as auxiliary pegs.\n\n4. **Move the Remaining 3 Disks**: Move the remaining 3 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3 using Peg 4 as an auxiliary peg.\n\n5. **Move the 4 Disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3**: Finally, move the 4 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3 using Pegs 2 and 4 as auxiliary pegs.\n\nFollowing these steps, we can derive the sequence of moves:\n\n```\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 6 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 7 from Peg 2 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 6 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 4 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 4\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 4\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 4 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 4"
