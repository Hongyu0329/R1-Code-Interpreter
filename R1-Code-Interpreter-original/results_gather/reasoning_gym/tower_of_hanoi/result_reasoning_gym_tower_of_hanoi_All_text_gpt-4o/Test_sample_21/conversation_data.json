    "To solve the Tower of Hanoi problem with 7 disks and 3 pegs, we need to follow a recursive approach. The goal is to move all disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3, using Peg 1 as an auxiliary peg. The rules are:\n\n1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n2. A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.\n3. All disks must be on a peg at all times.\n\nThe recursive solution involves three main steps:\n\n1. Move the top n-1 disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg.\n2. Move the nth (largest) disk directly to the destination peg.\n3. Move the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.\n\nFor 7 disks, the steps are as follows:\n\n1. Move 6 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1 using Peg 3 as auxiliary.\n2. Move disk 7 from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n3. Move 6 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3 using Peg 2 as auxiliary.\n\nLet's break down these steps further:\n\n### Step 1: Move 6 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 1\n- Move 5 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3 using Peg 1 as auxiliary.\n- Move disk 6 from Peg 2 to Peg 1.\n- Move 5 disks from Peg 3 to Peg 1 using Peg 2 as auxiliary.\n\n### Step 2: Move disk 7 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\n- Move disk 7 from Peg 2 to Peg 3.\n\n### Step 3: Move 6 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 3\n- Move 5 disks from Peg 1 to Peg 2 using Peg 3 as auxiliary.\n- Move disk 6 from Peg 1 to Peg 3.\n- Move 5 disks from Peg 2 to Peg 3 using Peg 1 as auxiliary.\n\nNow, let's detail the moves for 5 disks, which is a subproblem of the above steps:\n\n#### Move 5 disks from Peg A to Peg B using Peg C as auxiliary\n1. Move 4 disks from Peg A to Peg C using Peg B as auxiliary.\n2. Move disk 5 from Peg A to Peg B.\n3. Move 4 disks from Peg C to Peg B using Peg A as auxiliary.\n\n#### Move 4 disks from Peg A to Peg B using Peg C as auxiliary\n1. Move 3 disks from Peg A to Peg C using Peg B as auxiliary.\n2. Move disk 4 from Peg A to Peg B.\n3. Move 3 disks from Peg C to Peg B using Peg A as auxiliary.\n\n#### Move 3 disks from Peg A to Peg B using Peg C as auxiliary\n1. Move 2 disks from Peg A to Peg C using Peg B as auxiliary.\n2. Move disk 3 from Peg A to Peg B.\n3. Move 2 disks from Peg C to Peg B using Peg A as auxiliary.\n\n#### Move 2 disks from Peg A to Peg B using Peg C as auxiliary\n1. Move disk 1 from Peg A to Peg C.\n2. Move disk 2 from Peg A to Peg B.\n3. Move disk 1 from Peg C to Peg B.\n\nNow, let's compile the complete sequence of moves for 7 disks:\n\n<<<\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 5 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 6 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 5 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 4 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 7 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 4 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 5 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 3 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 4 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 2 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 3 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 2 from Peg 3 to Peg 2\nMove disk 1 from Peg 1 to Peg 2\nMove disk 6 from Peg 1 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 2 from Peg 2 to Peg 1\nMove disk 1 from Peg 3 to Peg 1\nMove disk 3 from Peg 2 to Peg 3\nMove disk 1 from Peg"
