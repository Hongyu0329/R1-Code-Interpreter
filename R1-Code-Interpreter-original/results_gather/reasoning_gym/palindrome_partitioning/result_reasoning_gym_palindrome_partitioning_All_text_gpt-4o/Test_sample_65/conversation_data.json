    "To solve the problem of partitioning the string \"ujjusral\" into palindromes, we need to follow a systematic approach. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to partition the string such that each substring in the partition is a palindrome. A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same backward as forward.\n\n2. **Identify Palindromes**: We need to identify all possible palindromic substrings within the given string \"ujjusral\".\n\n3. **Recursive Backtracking Approach**: We can use a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible partitions of the string and check if each partition consists of palindromic substrings.\n\n4. **Base Case**: If the entire string is processed, add the current partition to the result list.\n\n5. **Recursive Case**: For each starting index, try to extend the substring to see if it forms a palindrome. If it does, recursively partition the remaining substring.\n\n6. **Check for Palindrome**: A helper function can be used to check if a given substring is a palindrome by comparing characters from the start and end moving towards the center.\n\n7. **Explore All Partitions**: Start from the first character and try to partition the string by checking each possible substring. If a substring is a palindrome, recursively partition the rest of the string.\n\n8. **Collect Results**: Collect all valid partitions where each substring is a palindrome.\n\nNow, let's apply this approach to the string \"ujjusral\":\n\n- Start with the first character 'u'. The substring 'u' is a palindrome.\n- Move to the next character 'j'. The substring 'j' is a palindrome.\n- Continue this process for each character: 'j', 'u', 's', 'r', 'a', 'l'. Each of these single characters is a palindrome.\n\n- Check for longer palindromes:\n  - \"ujju\" is a palindrome (reads the same backward).\n  - \"jj\" is a palindrome.\n  - \"uju\" is a palindrome.\n\n- Explore all possible partitions:\n  - [\"u\", \"j\", \"j\", \"u\", \"s\", \"r\", \"a\", \"l\"]\n  - [\"u\", \"jj\", \"u\", \"s\", \"r\", \"a\", \"l\"]\n  - [\"ujju\", \"s\", \"r\", \"a\", \"l\"]\n\nThese are the partitions where each substring is a palindrome.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<<<[[\"u\", \"j\", \"j\", \"u\", \"s\", \"r\", \"a\", \"l\"], [\"u\", \"jj\", \"u\", \"s\", \"r\", \"a\", \"l\"], [\"ujju\", \"s\", \"r\", \"a\", \"l\"]]>>>"
