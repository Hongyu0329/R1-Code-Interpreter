    "To solve the problem of partitioning the string \"agegvckakcgnnrw\" into palindromes, we need to follow a systematic approach. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to partition the string such that each substring is a palindrome. A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same backward as forward.\n\n2. **Identify Palindromes**: We need to identify all possible palindromic substrings within the given string. This involves checking each possible substring to see if it is a palindrome.\n\n3. **Recursive Backtracking**: Use a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible partitions of the string. For each position in the string, we can choose to partition it if the substring from the start to that position is a palindrome.\n\n4. **Base Case**: The base case for the recursion is when we reach the end of the string. At this point, we have a valid partition, and we can add it to our list of results.\n\n5. **Recursive Case**: For each character in the string, check if the substring from the current position to the end is a palindrome. If it is, recursively partition the remaining substring.\n\n6. **Combine Results**: Collect all valid partitions and return them as a list of lists, where each list represents a valid palindrome partition.\n\n7. **Output Format**: The final output should be enclosed within triple angle brackets, as specified.\n\nNow, let's apply this approach to the given string \"agegvckakcgnnrw\":\n\n- Start with the first character 'a'. It is a palindrome. Partition the rest of the string.\n- Continue this process for each character, checking for palindromes and partitioning accordingly.\n- For example, 'g' is a palindrome, 'e' is a palindrome, 'v' is a palindrome, and so on.\n- Check for longer palindromes as well, such as 'nn' in the string.\n\nAfter exploring all possible partitions, we find that the string \"agegvckakcgnnrw\" does not have any palindromic partitions longer than single characters, except for 'nn'. Therefore, the only valid partition is each character as a separate palindrome, except for 'nn'.\n\nThe final partition is:\n- [\"a\", \"g\", \"e\", \"g\", \"v\", \"c\", \"k\", \"a\", \"k\", \"c\", \"g\", \"nn\", \"r\", \"w\"]\n\nThus, the output is:\n\n<<<[[\"a\", \"g\", \"e\", \"g\", \"v\", \"c\", \"k\", \"a\", \"k\", \"c\", \"g\", \"nn\", \"r\", \"w\"]>>>"
