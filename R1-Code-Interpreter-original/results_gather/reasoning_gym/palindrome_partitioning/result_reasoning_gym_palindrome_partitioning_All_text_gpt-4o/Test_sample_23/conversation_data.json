    "To solve the problem of partitioning the string \"ddvxvj\" into palindromes, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to partition the string such that each substring in the partition is a palindrome. A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same backward as forward.\n\n2. **Identify Palindromes**: We need to identify all possible palindromic substrings within the given string \"ddvxvj\".\n\n3. **Recursive Backtracking Approach**: We can use a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible partitions of the string and check if each partition is a palindrome.\n\n4. **Base Case**: If we reach the end of the string, we add the current partition to the result list.\n\n5. **Recursive Case**: For each starting index, we try to extend the substring and check if it forms a palindrome. If it does, we recursively partition the remaining substring.\n\n6. **Check for Palindrome**: A helper function can be used to check if a given substring is a palindrome by comparing characters from the start and end moving towards the center.\n\n7. **Iterate Over Substrings**: Start from the beginning of the string and iterate over all possible end indices to form substrings. For each substring, check if it is a palindrome.\n\n8. **Store Valid Partitions**: If a valid palindrome partition is found, store it in the result list.\n\n9. **Output the Result**: Once all possible partitions are explored, output the result list.\n\nNow, let's apply this approach to the string \"ddvxvj\":\n\n- Start with the first character 'd'. It is a palindrome by itself.\n- Check the substring \"dd\". It is a palindrome.\n- Continue with the next character 'v'. It is a palindrome by itself.\n- Check the substring \"vx\". It is not a palindrome.\n- Check the substring \"x\". It is a palindrome by itself.\n- Check the substring \"vj\". It is not a palindrome.\n- Check the substring \"j\". It is a palindrome by itself.\n\nFollowing this process, we find that the only palindromic partitions of \"ddvxvj\" are:\n\n1. [\"d\", \"d\", \"v\", \"x\", \"v\", \"j\"]\n2. [\"dd\", \"v\", \"x\", \"v\", \"j\"]\n\nThese are the partitions where each substring is a palindrome.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<<<[[\"d\", \"d\", \"v\", \"x\", \"v\", \"j\"], [\"dd\", \"v\", \"x\", \"v\", \"j\"]>>>"
