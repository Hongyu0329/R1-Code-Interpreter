    "To solve the problem of partitioning the string \"ddmmdq\" into palindromes, we need to follow a systematic approach. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to partition the string such that each substring is a palindrome. A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same backward as forward.\n\n2. **Identify Palindromes**: We need to identify all possible palindromic substrings within the given string \"ddmmdq\".\n\n3. **Recursive Backtracking Approach**: We can use a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible partitions and check if each partition is a palindrome.\n\n4. **Base Case**: If we reach the end of the string, we add the current partition to the result list.\n\n5. **Recursive Case**: For each starting index, we try to extend the substring and check if it forms a palindrome. If it does, we recursively partition the remaining substring.\n\n6. **Check for Palindrome**: A helper function can be used to check if a given substring is a palindrome by comparing characters from the start and end moving towards the center.\n\n7. **Iterate Over Substrings**: Start from the first character and iterate over possible end indices to form substrings. For each substring, check if it is a palindrome.\n\n8. **Store Valid Partitions**: If a substring is a palindrome, store it and recursively partition the rest of the string.\n\n9. **Combine Results**: Collect all valid partitions and return them as the final result.\n\nNow, let's apply this approach to the string \"ddmmdq\":\n\n- Start with the first character 'd':\n  - 'd' is a palindrome. Partition the rest: \"dmmdq\".\n- Continue with the next character 'd':\n  - 'd' is a palindrome. Partition the rest: \"mmdq\".\n- Next, consider 'm':\n  - 'm' is a palindrome. Partition the rest: \"mdq\".\n- Next, consider 'm':\n  - 'm' is a palindrome. Partition the rest: \"dq\".\n- Next, consider 'd':\n  - 'd' is a palindrome. Partition the rest: \"q\".\n- Finally, 'q' is a palindrome.\n\nThis gives us one possible partition: [\"d\", \"d\", \"m\", \"m\", \"d\", \"q\"].\n\n- Consider 'dd':\n  - 'dd' is a palindrome. Partition the rest: \"mmdq\".\n- Consider 'mm':\n  - 'mm' is a palindrome. Partition the rest: \"dq\".\n- Consider 'd':\n  - 'd' is a palindrome. Partition the rest: \"q\".\n- Finally, 'q' is a palindrome.\n\nThis gives us another partition: [\"dd\", \"m\", \"m\", \"d\", \"q\"].\n\n- Consider 'dmmd':\n  - 'dmmd' is a palindrome. Partition the rest: \"q\".\n- Finally, 'q' is a palindrome.\n\nThis gives us another partition: [\"d\", \"d\", \"mm\", \"d\", \"q\"].\n\n- Consider 'ddmm':\n  - 'ddmm' is not a palindrome, so we skip it.\n\n- Consider 'ddmmd':\n  - 'ddmmd' is a palindrome. Partition the rest: \"q\".\n- Finally, 'q' is a palindrome.\n\nThis gives us another partition: [\"ddmmd\", \"q\"].\n\nAfter considering all possible partitions, we collect the valid ones.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<[[\"d\", \"d\", \"m\", \"m\", \"d\", \"q\"], [\"dd\", \"m\", \"m\", \"d\", \"q\"], [\"d\", \"d\", \"mm\", \"d\", \"q\"], [\"ddmmd\", \"q\"]]>>>"
