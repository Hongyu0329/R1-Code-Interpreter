    "To solve the problem of partitioning the string \"ommojoj\" into palindromes, we need to follow a systematic approach. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to partition the string such that each substring in the partition is a palindrome. A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same backward as forward.\n\n2. **Identify Palindromes**: We need to identify all possible palindromic substrings within the string \"ommojoj\". This includes single characters (since any single character is a palindrome) and longer palindromic sequences.\n\n3. **Recursive Backtracking Approach**: We can use a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible partitions of the string. At each step, we check if the current substring is a palindrome. If it is, we recursively partition the remaining substring.\n\n4. **Base Case**: The base case for our recursion is when we reach the end of the string. At this point, we have a valid partition, and we can add it to our list of results.\n\n5. **Explore All Partitions**: We need to explore all possible partitions by considering each possible starting point for a palindrome and recursively partitioning the rest of the string.\n\n6. **Implementation Details**:\n   - Start with an empty list to store the current partition.\n   - Iterate over the string, expanding the current substring.\n   - Check if the current substring is a palindrome.\n   - If it is, add it to the current partition and recursively partition the remaining string.\n   - Backtrack by removing the last added substring and continue exploring other partitions.\n\n7. **Check for Palindrome**: A helper function can be used to check if a given substring is a palindrome by comparing characters from the start and end moving towards the center.\n\n8. **Collect Results**: Collect all valid partitions in a list of lists format.\n\nNow, let's apply this approach to the string \"ommojoj\":\n\n- Start with the first character 'o', which is a palindrome. Partition the rest \"mmojoj\".\n- 'm' is a palindrome. Partition the rest \"mojoj\".\n- 'm' is a palindrome. Partition the rest \"oj\".\n- 'o' is a palindrome. Partition the rest \"j\".\n- 'j' is a palindrome. This gives us one partition: [\"o\", \"m\", \"m\", \"o\", \"j\", \"o\", \"j\"].\n\n- Backtrack and try \"moj\" as a palindrome, but it is not.\n- Try \"ojo\" as a palindrome. Partition the rest \"j\".\n- 'j' is a palindrome. This gives another partition: [\"o\", \"m\", \"m\", \"ojo\", \"j\"].\n\n- Backtrack and try \"mm\" as a palindrome. Partition the rest \"ojoj\".\n- 'o' is a palindrome. Partition the rest \"joj\".\n- 'j' is a palindrome. Partition the rest \"oj\".\n- 'o' is a palindrome. Partition the rest \"j\".\n- 'j' is a palindrome. This gives another partition: [\"o\", \"mm\", \"o\", \"j\", \"o\", \"j\"].\n\n- Backtrack and try \"ojo\" as a palindrome. Partition the rest \"j\".\n- 'j' is a palindrome. This gives another partition: [\"o\", \"mm\", \"ojo\", \"j\"].\n\n- Backtrack and try \"ommo\" as a palindrome, but it is not.\n- Try \"ommoj\" as a palindrome, but it is not.\n- Try \"ommojo\" as a palindrome, but it is not.\n- Try \"ommojoj\" as a palindrome, but it is not.\n\nAfter exploring all possibilities, we collect all valid partitions.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<[[\"o\", \"m\", \"m\", \"o\", \"j\", \"o\", \"j\"], [\"o\", \"m\", \"m\", \"ojo\", \"j\"], [\"o\", \"mm\", \"o\", \"j\", \"o\", \"j\"], [\"o\", \"mm\", \"ojo\", \"j\"]]>>>"
