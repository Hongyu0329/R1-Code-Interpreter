    "To solve the problem of partitioning the string \"oohzhpjmjifi\" into palindromes, we need to follow a systematic approach. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to partition the string such that each substring is a palindrome. A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same backward as forward.\n\n2. **Identify Subproblems**: The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems where we check each possible substring to see if it is a palindrome and then recursively partition the remaining string.\n\n3. **Recursive Backtracking Approach**:\n   - Start from the beginning of the string and try to partition it at every possible position.\n   - For each partition, check if the substring is a palindrome.\n   - If it is a palindrome, recursively partition the remaining substring.\n   - Collect all partitions that result in palindromes.\n\n4. **Base Case**: If the entire string is processed, add the current partition to the result list.\n\n5. **Palindrome Check**: A helper function to check if a given substring is a palindrome by comparing characters from the start and end moving towards the center.\n\n6. **Iterate and Partition**:\n   - Start with an empty list to store the current partition.\n   - Iterate over the string, and for each character, check if the substring from the start to the current character is a palindrome.\n   - If it is, add it to the current partition and recursively process the remaining string.\n\n7. **Collect Results**: Once the end of the string is reached with valid partitions, add the current partition to the result list.\n\n8. **Output Format**: The final result should be a list of lists, where each list contains a valid palindrome partition of the string.\n\nNow, let's apply this approach to the string \"oohzhpjmjifi\":\n\n- Start with the first character 'o', check if it's a palindrome (it is), and recursively partition the rest.\n- Continue this process for each character, checking for palindromes and partitioning the remaining string.\n- Collect all valid partitions.\n\nAfter applying the above steps, the possible palindrome partitions of the string \"oohzhpjmjifi\" are:\n\n<<<[[\"o\", \"o\", \"h\", \"z\", \"h\", \"p\", \"j\", \"m\", \"j\", \"i\", \"f\", \"i\"], [\"o\", \"o\", \"h\", \"z\", \"h\", \"p\", \"j\", \"m\", \"j\", \"ifi\"], [\"o\", \"o\", \"hzh\", \"p\", \"j\", \"m\", \"j\", \"i\", \"f\", \"i\"], [\"o\", \"o\", \"hzh\", \"p\", \"j\", \"m\", \"j\", \"ifi\"]]>>>"
