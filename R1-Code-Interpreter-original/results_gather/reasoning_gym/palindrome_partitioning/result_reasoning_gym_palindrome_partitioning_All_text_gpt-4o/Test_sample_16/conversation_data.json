    "To solve the problem of partitioning the string \"dwdhygyhezzep\" into palindromes, we need to follow a systematic approach. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to partition the string such that each substring is a palindrome. A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same backward as forward.\n\n2. **Identify Palindromes**: We need to identify all possible palindromic substrings within the given string. This involves checking each possible substring to see if it is a palindrome.\n\n3. **Recursive Backtracking**: Use a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible partitions. For each position in the string, we can choose to partition it if the substring up to that point is a palindrome.\n\n4. **Base Case**: If we reach the end of the string, we have found a valid partitioning, and we can add it to our list of results.\n\n5. **Recursive Case**: For each starting position, iterate over possible ending positions. If the substring from the start to the end is a palindrome, recursively partition the remaining substring.\n\n6. **Efficiency Considerations**: To avoid redundant checks, we can use a helper function to check if a substring is a palindrome. Additionally, memoization can be used to store results of previously computed substrings to improve efficiency.\n\n7. **Construct the Result**: As we find valid partitions, we construct the result as a list of lists, where each list contains palindromic substrings.\n\n8. **Output Format**: The final output should be enclosed within triple angle brackets, as specified.\n\nNow, let's apply this approach to the string \"dwdhygyhezzep\":\n\n- Start with the first character 'd'. It is a palindrome by itself.\n- Check the next character 'w'. It is also a palindrome.\n- Continue this process for each character, checking for longer palindromes as well.\n- For example, 'dwd' is a palindrome, 'h' is a palindrome, 'y' is a palindrome, 'g' is a palindrome, 'y' is a palindrome, 'h' is a palindrome, 'e' is a palindrome, 'z' is a palindrome, 'zz' is a palindrome, 'e' is a palindrome, 'p' is a palindrome.\n- Combine these palindromes to form all possible partitions.\n\nAfter performing the above steps, we find the following palindrome partitions for the string \"dwdhygyhezzep\":\n\n<<<[[\"d\", \"w\", \"d\", \"h\", \"y\", \"g\", \"y\", \"h\", \"e\", \"z\", \"z\", \"e\", \"p\"], [\"d\", \"w\", \"d\", \"h\", \"y\", \"g\", \"y\", \"h\", \"e\", \"zz\", \"e\", \"p\"], [\"dwd\", \"h\", \"y\", \"g\", \"y\", \"h\", \"e\", \"z\", \"z\", \"e\", \"p\"], [\"dwd\", \"h\", \"y\", \"g\", \"y\", \"h\", \"e\", \"zz\", \"e\", \"p\"] ]>>>"
