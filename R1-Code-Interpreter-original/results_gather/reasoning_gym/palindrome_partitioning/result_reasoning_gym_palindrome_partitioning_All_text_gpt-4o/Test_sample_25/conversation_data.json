    "To solve the problem of partitioning the string \"papnn\" into palindromes, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to partition the string such that each substring in the partition is a palindrome. A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same backward as forward.\n\n2. **Identify Palindromes**: We need to identify all possible palindromic substrings within the string \"papnn\". \n\n3. **Recursive Backtracking Approach**: We can use a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible partitions of the string and check if each partition consists of palindromic substrings.\n\n4. **Base Case**: If we reach the end of the string, we have found a valid partition and can add it to our list of results.\n\n5. **Recursive Case**: For each starting index, try to extend the substring to see if it forms a palindrome. If it does, recursively partition the remaining substring.\n\n6. **Check for Palindrome**: To check if a substring is a palindrome, compare characters from the start and end moving towards the center.\n\n7. **Iterate Over Substrings**: Start from the beginning of the string and iterate over possible end indices to form substrings. For each substring, check if it is a palindrome.\n\n8. **Store Results**: If a valid partition is found, store it in the results list.\n\nNow, let's apply this approach to the string \"papnn\":\n\n- Start with the first character 'p'. It is a palindrome. Partition the rest \"apnn\".\n- Next, 'a' is a palindrome. Partition the rest \"pnn\".\n- 'p' is a palindrome. Partition the rest \"nn\".\n- 'n' is a palindrome. Partition the rest \"n\".\n- 'n' is a palindrome. We have reached the end of the string. This gives us one partition: [\"p\", \"a\", \"p\", \"n\", \"n\"].\n\n- Backtrack and try other combinations:\n  - \"nn\" is a palindrome. Partition the rest \"p\".\n  - \"p\" is a palindrome. This gives us another partition: [\"p\", \"a\", \"p\", \"nn\"].\n\n- Backtrack further:\n  - \"pap\" is a palindrome. Partition the rest \"nn\".\n  - \"nn\" is a palindrome. This gives us another partition: [\"pap\", \"n\", \"n\"].\n\n- Check for other combinations:\n  - \"p\" is a palindrome. Partition the rest \"apnn\".\n  - \"ap\" is not a palindrome, so skip.\n  - \"apn\" is not a palindrome, so skip.\n  - \"apnn\" is not a palindrome, so skip.\n\n- Check for other combinations:\n  - \"pa\" is not a palindrome, so skip.\n  - \"pan\" is not a palindrome, so skip.\n  - \"pann\" is not a palindrome, so skip.\n\n- Check for other combinations:\n  - \"papn\" is not a palindrome, so skip.\n  - \"papnn\" is not a palindrome, so skip.\n\nAfter exploring all possible partitions, we find the following valid palindrome partitions:\n\n<<<[[\"p\", \"a\", \"p\", \"n\", \"n\"], [\"p\", \"a\", \"p\", \"nn\"], [\"pap\", \"n\", \"n\"]]>>>"
