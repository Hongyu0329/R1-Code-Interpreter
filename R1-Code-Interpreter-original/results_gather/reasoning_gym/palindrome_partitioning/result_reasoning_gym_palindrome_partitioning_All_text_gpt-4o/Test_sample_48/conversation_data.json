    "To solve the problem of partitioning the string \"ossojnnja\" into palindromes, we need to follow a systematic approach. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to partition the string such that each substring in the partition is a palindrome. A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same backward as forward.\n\n2. **Identify Palindromes**: We need to identify all possible palindromic substrings within the given string. This involves checking each possible substring to see if it is a palindrome.\n\n3. **Recursive Backtracking Approach**: \n   - Use a recursive function to explore all possible partitions of the string.\n   - At each step, check if the current substring is a palindrome.\n   - If it is, recursively partition the remaining substring.\n   - Collect all partitions that result in palindromic substrings.\n\n4. **Base Case**: If the entire string is processed, add the current partition to the result list.\n\n5. **Check for Palindrome**: A helper function can be used to check if a given substring is a palindrome by comparing characters from the start and end moving towards the center.\n\n6. **Iterate Over Substrings**: For each starting index, iterate over possible ending indices to form substrings and check for palindromes.\n\n7. **Collect Results**: Store each valid partition (where all substrings are palindromes) in a list of lists.\n\n8. **Output Format**: The final output should be a list of lists, where each list represents a valid palindrome partition of the string.\n\nNow, let's apply this approach to the string \"ossojnnja\":\n\n- Start with the first character 'o', which is a palindrome.\n- Continue with 's', 'ss', 'o', 'j', 'n', 'nn', 'j', 'a', each of which can be a palindrome on its own.\n- Check combinations like 'osso', which is a palindrome.\n- Explore all possible partitions recursively.\n\nAfter exploring all possibilities, the valid palindrome partitions of \"ossojnnja\" are:\n\n- [\"o\", \"s\", \"s\", \"o\", \"j\", \"n\", \"n\", \"j\", \"a\"]\n- [\"o\", \"s\", \"s\", \"o\", \"j\", \"nn\", \"j\", \"a\"]\n- [\"o\", \"ss\", \"o\", \"j\", \"n\", \"n\", \"j\", \"a\"]\n- [\"o\", \"ss\", \"o\", \"j\", \"nn\", \"j\", \"a\"]\n- [\"osso\", \"j\", \"n\", \"n\", \"j\", \"a\"]\n- [\"osso\", \"j\", \"nn\", \"j\", \"a\"]\n\nThese partitions ensure that every substring is a palindrome.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<<<[[\"o\", \"s\", \"s\", \"o\", \"j\", \"n\", \"n\", \"j\", \"a\"], [\"o\", \"s\", \"s\", \"o\", \"j\", \"nn\", \"j\", \"a\"], [\"o\", \"ss\", \"o\", \"j\", \"n\", \"n\", \"j\", \"a\"], [\"o\", \"ss\", \"o\", \"j\", \"nn\", \"j\", \"a\"], [\"osso\", \"j\", \"n\", \"n\", \"j\", \"a\"], [\"osso\", \"j\", \"nn\", \"j\", \"a\"]>>>"
