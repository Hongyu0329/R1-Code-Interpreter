    "To solve the problem of partitioning the string \"yzkkzn\" into palindromes, we need to follow a systematic approach. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to partition the string such that each substring in the partition is a palindrome. A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same backward as forward.\n\n2. **Identify Palindromes**: We need to identify all possible palindromic substrings within the given string \"yzkkzn\".\n\n3. **Recursive Backtracking Approach**: We can use a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible partitions of the string and check if each partition consists of palindromic substrings.\n\n4. **Base Case**: If we reach the end of the string, we add the current partition to the result list.\n\n5. **Recursive Case**: For each starting index, we try to extend the substring to see if it forms a palindrome. If it does, we recursively partition the remaining substring.\n\n6. **Check for Palindrome**: For a substring to be a palindrome, the first and last characters must be the same, and the substring between them must also be a palindrome.\n\n7. **Iterate Over Substrings**: Start from the beginning of the string and iterate over all possible end indices to form substrings. Check each substring for the palindrome property.\n\n8. **Store Valid Partitions**: If a valid partition is found (all substrings are palindromes), store it in the result list.\n\n9. **Output Format**: The result should be a list of lists, where each list represents a valid palindrome partition of the string.\n\nNow, let's apply this approach to the string \"yzkkzn\":\n\n- Start with the first character 'y'. It is a palindrome by itself. Check the rest of the string \"zkkzn\".\n- 'z' is a palindrome. Check \"kkzn\".\n- 'k' is a palindrome. Check \"kzn\".\n- 'k' is a palindrome. Check \"zn\".\n- 'z' is a palindrome. Check \"n\".\n- 'n' is a palindrome. This gives us one partition: [\"y\", \"z\", \"k\", \"k\", \"z\", \"n\"].\n\n- Check for longer palindromes:\n  - \"kk\" is a palindrome. Check \"zn\".\n  - \"z\" is a palindrome. Check \"n\".\n  - \"n\" is a palindrome. This gives us another partition: [\"y\", \"z\", \"kk\", \"z\", \"n\"].\n\n- No other combinations of substrings form palindromes.\n\nThus, the possible palindrome partitions of the string \"yzkkzn\" are:\n\n<<<[[\"y\", \"z\", \"k\", \"k\", \"z\", \"n\"], [\"y\", \"z\", \"kk\", \"z\", \"n\"]>>>"
