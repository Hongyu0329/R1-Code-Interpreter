    "To solve the problem of partitioning the string \"fffprrphwwh\" into palindromes, we need to follow a systematic approach. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to partition the string such that each substring is a palindrome. A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same backward as forward.\n\n2. **Identify Palindromes**: We need to identify all possible palindromic substrings within the given string. This involves checking each possible substring to see if it is a palindrome.\n\n3. **Recursive Backtracking**: We can use a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible partitions. For each position in the string, we can choose to partition the string if the current substring is a palindrome, and then recursively partition the remaining string.\n\n4. **Base Case**: The base case for the recursion is when we reach the end of the string. At this point, we have a valid partition, and we can add it to our list of results.\n\n5. **Explore All Partitions**: We need to explore all possible partitions by trying to partition the string at every possible position where the substring is a palindrome.\n\n6. **Collect Results**: As we find valid partitions, we collect them into a list of lists, where each list represents a valid palindrome partitioning of the string.\n\n7. **Output Format**: The final output should be a list of lists enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply this approach to the string \"fffprrphwwh\":\n\n- Start with the first character 'f'. It is a palindrome by itself. Continue to check the next characters.\n- \"ff\" is a palindrome. Continue to check further.\n- \"fff\" is a palindrome. Continue to check further.\n- \"p\" is a palindrome. Continue to check further.\n- \"rr\" is a palindrome. Continue to check further.\n- \"rpr\" is a palindrome. Continue to check further.\n- \"h\" is a palindrome. Continue to check further.\n- \"ww\" is a palindrome. Continue to check further.\n- \"h\" is a palindrome. Continue to check further.\n\nBy exploring all possible partitions, we can find the following palindrome partitions:\n\n1. [\"f\", \"f\", \"f\", \"p\", \"r\", \"r\", \"p\", \"h\", \"w\", \"w\", \"h\"]\n2. [\"f\", \"f\", \"f\", \"p\", \"r\", \"r\", \"p\", \"h\", \"ww\", \"h\"]\n3. [\"f\", \"f\", \"f\", \"p\", \"rr\", \"p\", \"h\", \"w\", \"w\", \"h\"]\n4. [\"f\", \"f\", \"f\", \"p\", \"rr\", \"p\", \"h\", \"ww\", \"h\"]\n5. [\"fff\", \"p\", \"r\", \"r\", \"p\", \"h\", \"w\", \"w\", \"h\"]\n6. [\"fff\", \"p\", \"r\", \"r\", \"p\", \"h\", \"ww\", \"h\"]\n7. [\"fff\", \"p\", \"rr\", \"p\", \"h\", \"w\", \"w\", \"h\"]\n8. [\"fff\", \"p\", \"rr\", \"p\", \"h\", \"ww\", \"h\"]\n\nThese are the possible partitions where each substring is a palindrome.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<<<[[\"f\", \"f\", \"f\", \"p\", \"r\", \"r\", \"p\", \"h\", \"w\", \"w\", \"h\"], [\"f\", \"f\", \"f\", \"p\", \"r\", \"r\", \"p\", \"h\", \"ww\", \"h\"], [\"f\", \"f\", \"f\", \"p\", \"rr\", \"p\", \"h\", \"w\", \"w\", \"h\"], [\"f\", \"f\", \"f\", \"p\", \"rr\", \"p\", \"h\", \"ww\", \"h\"], [\"fff\", \"p\", \"r\", \"r\", \"p\", \"h\", \"w\", \"w\", \"h\"], [\"fff\", \"p\", \"r\", \"r\", \"p\", \"h\", \"ww\", \"h\"], [\"fff\", \"p\", \"rr\", \"p\", \"h\", \"w\", \"w\", \"h\"], [\"fff\", \"p\", \"rr\", \"p\", \"h\", \"ww\", \"h\"]>>>"
