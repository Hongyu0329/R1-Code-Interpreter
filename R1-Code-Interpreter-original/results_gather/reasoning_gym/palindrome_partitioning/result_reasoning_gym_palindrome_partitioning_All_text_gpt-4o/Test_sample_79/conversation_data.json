    "To solve the problem of partitioning the string \"mmmqeeqw\" into palindromes, we need to follow a systematic approach. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to partition the string such that each substring is a palindrome. A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same backward as forward.\n\n2. **Identify Palindromes**: We need to identify all possible palindromic substrings within the given string. This includes single characters (which are trivially palindromes) and longer substrings.\n\n3. **Recursive Backtracking Approach**: We can use a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible partitions of the string. For each position in the string, we can choose to partition it if the substring up to that point is a palindrome.\n\n4. **Base Case**: The base case for our recursion will be when we reach the end of the string. At this point, we have a valid partitioning of the string into palindromes.\n\n5. **Recursive Case**: For each character in the string, we check if the substring from the current position to the next is a palindrome. If it is, we recursively partition the remaining substring.\n\n6. **Check for Palindrome**: To check if a substring is a palindrome, we compare characters from the start and end of the substring moving towards the center.\n\n7. **Collect Results**: As we find valid partitions, we collect them into a list of lists, where each list represents a valid partitioning of the string into palindromes.\n\n8. **Output Format**: The final output should be a list of lists enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nNow, let's apply this approach to the string \"mmmqeeqw\":\n\n- Start with the first character 'm'. The substrings \"m\", \"mm\", \"mmm\" are palindromes.\n- For \"mmm\", the remaining string is \"qeeqw\". We need to partition \"qeeqw\" into palindromes.\n- \"qeeqw\" can be partitioned as [\"q\", \"e\", \"e\", \"q\", \"w\"], [\"q\", \"ee\", \"q\", \"w\"], or [\"qeeq\", \"w\"].\n- Combine these with the initial partitions of \"mmm\" to get complete partitions of the original string.\n\nFollowing this process, we find all possible palindrome partitions of \"mmmqeeqw\":\n\n- [\"m\", \"m\", \"m\", \"q\", \"e\", \"e\", \"q\", \"w\"]\n- [\"m\", \"m\", \"m\", \"q\", \"ee\", \"q\", \"w\"]\n- [\"m\", \"m\", \"m\", \"qeeq\", \"w\"]\n- [\"mm\", \"m\", \"q\", \"e\", \"e\", \"q\", \"w\"]\n- [\"mm\", \"m\", \"q\", \"ee\", \"q\", \"w\"]\n- [\"mm\", \"m\", \"qeeq\", \"w\"]\n- [\"mmm\", \"q\", \"e\", \"e\", \"q\", \"w\"]\n- [\"mmm\", \"q\", \"ee\", \"q\", \"w\"]\n- [\"mmm\", \"qeeq\", \"w\"]\n\nThe final answer, formatted as required, is:\n\n<<<[[\"m\", \"m\", \"m\", \"q\", \"e\", \"e\", \"q\", \"w\"], [\"m\", \"m\", \"m\", \"q\", \"ee\", \"q\", \"w\"], [\"m\", \"m\", \"m\", \"qeeq\", \"w\"], [\"mm\", \"m\", \"q\", \"e\", \"e\", \"q\", \"w\"], [\"mm\", \"m\", \"q\", \"ee\", \"q\", \"w\"], [\"mm\", \"m\", \"qeeq\", \"w\"], [\"mmm\", \"q\", \"e\", \"e\", \"q\", \"w\"], [\"mmm\", \"q\", \"ee\", \"q\", \"w\"], [\"mmm\", \"qeeq\", \"w\"]>>>"
