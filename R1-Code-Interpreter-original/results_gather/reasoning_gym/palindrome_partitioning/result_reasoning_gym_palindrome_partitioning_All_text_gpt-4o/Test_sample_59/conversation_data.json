    "To solve the problem of partitioning the string \"erfreo\" into palindromes, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to partition the string such that each substring is a palindrome. A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same backward as forward.\n\n2. **Identify Palindromes**: We need to identify all possible palindromic substrings within the given string \"erfreo\".\n\n3. **Recursive Backtracking Approach**: We can use a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible partitions of the string and check if each partition is a palindrome.\n\n4. **Base Case**: If we reach the end of the string, we add the current partition to the result list.\n\n5. **Recursive Case**: For each starting index, we try to extend the substring and check if it forms a palindrome. If it does, we recursively partition the remaining substring.\n\n6. **Check for Palindrome**: A helper function can be used to check if a given substring is a palindrome by comparing characters from the start and end moving towards the center.\n\n7. **Iterate Over Substrings**: For each character in the string, consider it as a potential start of a palindrome and try to extend it to form a valid palindrome.\n\n8. **Collect Results**: Collect all valid partitions where each substring is a palindrome.\n\nNow, let's apply this approach to the string \"erfreo\":\n\n- Start with the first character 'e'. It is a palindrome by itself.\n- Move to the next character 'r'. It is also a palindrome.\n- Continue with 'f', 'r', 'e', and 'o', each being a palindrome individually.\n\nSince there are no longer palindromic substrings in \"erfreo\" (like \"aa\" in \"aab\"), each character will be a separate palindrome.\n\nThus, the only partition where each substring is a palindrome is:\n\n- [\"e\", \"r\", \"f\", \"r\", \"e\", \"o\"]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[[\"e\", \"r\", \"f\", \"r\", \"e\", \"o\"]>>>"
