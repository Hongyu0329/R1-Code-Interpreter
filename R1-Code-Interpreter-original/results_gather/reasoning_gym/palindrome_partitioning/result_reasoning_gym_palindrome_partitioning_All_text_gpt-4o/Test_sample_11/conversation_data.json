    "To solve the problem of partitioning the string \"sesjj\" into palindromes, we need to follow a systematic approach. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to partition the string such that each substring in the partition is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward.\n\n2. **Identify Palindromes**: \n   - Single characters are always palindromes. Therefore, each character in \"sesjj\" can be considered a palindrome.\n   - Check for longer palindromes:\n     - \"ses\" is a palindrome because it reads the same forward and backward.\n     - \"jj\" is a palindrome because it reads the same forward and backward.\n\n3. **Recursive Backtracking Approach**:\n   - Start from the beginning of the string and try to partition it into palindromes.\n   - For each position, check all possible substrings starting from that position.\n   - If a substring is a palindrome, recursively partition the remaining substring.\n   - Collect all partitions that result in palindromes.\n\n4. **Generate Partitions**:\n   - Start with the first character 's':\n     - Partition as ['s', 'e', 's', 'j', 'j'].\n     - Check for longer palindromes starting from 's':\n       - 'ses' is a palindrome, so partition as ['ses', 'j', 'j'].\n   - Start with the second character 'e':\n     - No longer palindromes starting from 'e'.\n   - Start with the third character 's':\n     - No longer palindromes starting from 's'.\n   - Start with the fourth character 'j':\n     - 'jj' is a palindrome, so partition as ['s', 'e', 's', 'jj'].\n\n5. **Compile Results**:\n   - Collect all valid partitions that consist entirely of palindromes.\n\n6. **Output the Result**:\n   - The partitions that satisfy the palindrome condition are:\n     - ['s', 'e', 's', 'j', 'j']\n     - ['ses', 'j', 'j']\n     - ['s', 'e', 's', 'jj']\n\nThe final answer, formatted as specified, is:\n\n<<<[['s', 'e', 's', 'j', 'j'], ['ses', 'j', 'j'], ['s', 'e', 's', 'jj']]>>>"
