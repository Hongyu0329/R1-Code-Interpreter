    "\nassistant > To partition the string \"erfreo\" into palindromes, we need to find all possible ways to split the string such that each substring is a palindrome. Let's go through the process to find all such partitions. \n\nWe'll use a backtracking approach to explore all possible partitions and check if each substring is a palindrome.
