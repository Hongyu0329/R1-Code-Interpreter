    "\nassistant > Let's perform the operations step by step on the given matrix:\n\n### Initial Matrix\n```\n5 7 0 8 3 9 3 4 7 3\n5 7 1 4 3 2 1 7 8 5\n3 7 5 3 6 6 3 1 6 7\n4 3 1 9 5 4 6 6 3 6\n1 6 6 0 7 3 8 1 5 0\n```\n\n### Operations\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: No change to the matrix.\n\n2. **Crop the matrix to rows 1-3 and columns 10-10 (1-indexed)**: This results in a 3x1 matrix:\n   ```\n   3\n   5\n   7\n   ```\n\n3. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: For a 3x1 matrix, this operation doesn't change the matrix.\n\n4. **Vertically mirror the matrix**: This operation flips the matrix upside down:\n   ```\n   7\n   5\n   3\n   ```\n\n5. **Crop the matrix to rows 1-1 and columns 3-3 (1-indexed)**: This results in a 1x1 matrix:\n   ```\n   3\n   ```\n\n6. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: For a 1x1 matrix, this operation doesn't change the matrix.\n\n7. **Map each occurrence of 2 to 8**: There are no 2s in the matrix, so no change occurs.\n\nThe final matrix is:\n```\n3\n```\n\nEnclosed within triple angle brackets, the output is:\n```\n<<<3>>>\n```"
