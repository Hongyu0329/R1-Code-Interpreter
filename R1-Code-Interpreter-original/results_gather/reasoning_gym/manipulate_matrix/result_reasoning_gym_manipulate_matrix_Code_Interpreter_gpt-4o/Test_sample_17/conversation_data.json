    "\nassistant > Let's perform the series of operations on the given matrix step by step:\n\n1. **Identity Transformation**: This operation does not change the matrix.\n\n2. **Rotate the Matrix 360 Degrees**: Rotating a matrix 360 degrees results in the same matrix.\n\n3. **Mirror the Matrix Along the Diagonal**: This operation involves transposing the matrix, i.e., swapping rows with columns.\n\n4. **Mirror the Matrix Along the Diagonal Again**: Performing the transpose operation again will revert the matrix back to its original form.\n\nLet's apply these operations to the given matrix:\n\n```\n6 1 5 8 8 0 0\n4 2 7 0 8 8 3\n9 4 9 5 6 0 3\n```\n\nWe'll perform the operations and output the final matrix.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [6, 1, 5, 8, 8, 0, 0],\n    [4, 2, 7, 0, 8, 8, 3],\n    [9, 4, 9, 5, 6, 0, 3]\n])\n\n# Identity transformation (no change)\nidentity_matrix = matrix.copy()\n\n# Rotate 360 degrees (no change)\nrotated_matrix = identity_matrix.copy()\n\n# Mirror along the diagonal (transpose)\nmirrored_once = rotated_matrix.T\n\n# Mirror along the diagonal again (transpose again)\nfinal_matrix = mirrored_once.T\n\nfinal_matrix_list = final_matrix.tolist()\nfinal_matrix_list\nassistant > After performing all the operations, the final matrix is:\n\n```\n6 1 5 8 8 0 0\n4 2 7 0 8 8 3\n9 4 9 5 6 0 3\n```\n\nEnclosed within triple angle brackets, the matrix is:\n\n<<<6 1 5 8 8 0 0\n4 2 7 0 8 8 3\n9 4 9 5 6 0 3>>>"
