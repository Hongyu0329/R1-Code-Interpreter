    "\nassistant > Let's perform the series of operations on the given matrix step by step.\n\nThe initial matrix is:\n```\n1 6 4 1 0 6\n8 8 5 5 0 2\n```\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This operation does not change the matrix, so it remains the same.\n\n2. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: This operation involves transposing the matrix. The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   1 8\n   6 8\n   4 5\n   1 5\n   0 0\n   6 2\n   ```\n\n3. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal again**: Transposing the matrix again will revert it to its original form:\n   ```\n   1 6 4 1 0 6\n   8 8 5 5 0 2\n   ```\n\n4. **Vertically mirror the matrix**: This operation involves flipping the matrix upside down. The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   8 8 5 5 0 2\n   1 6 4 1 0 6\n   ```\n\nNow, let's format the final matrix as requested.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [1, 6, 4, 1, 0, 6],\n    [8, 8, 5, 5, 0, 2]\n]\n\n# Vertically mirror the matrix\nfinal_matrix = matrix[::-1]\n\n# Format the final matrix\nformatted_matrix = \"<<<\" + \"\\n\".join(\" \".join(map(str, row)) for row in final_matrix) + \">>>\"\nformatted_matrix\nassistant > The final matrix after performing all the operations is:\n\n```\n<<<8 8 5 5 0 2\n1 6 4 1 0 6>>>\n```"
