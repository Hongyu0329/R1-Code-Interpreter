    "\nassistant > Let's perform the series of operations on the given matrix step by step.\n\nThe initial matrix is:\n```\n2 7 5 1 7 9\n7 9 0 8 6 9\n```\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: No change to the matrix.\n   ```\n   2 7 5 1 7 9\n   7 9 0 8 6 9\n   ```\n\n2. **Set all elements divisible by 9 to zero**:\n   ```\n   2 7 5 1 7 0\n   7 0 0 8 6 0\n   ```\n\n3. **Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed)**: Remove the second row.\n   ```\n   2 7 5 1 7 0\n   ```\n\n4. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: Since the matrix is now a single row, this operation doesn't change it.\n   ```\n   2 7 5 1 7 0\n   ```\n\n5. **Rotate the matrix 90 degrees**: Convert the row into a column.\n   ```\n   2\n   7\n   5\n   1\n   7\n   0\n   ```\n\n6. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: Convert the column back into a row.\n   ```\n   2 7 5 1 7 0\n   ```\n\n7. **Rotate the matrix 360 degrees**: This operation doesn't change the matrix.\n   ```\n   2 7 5 1 7 0\n   ```\n\nThe final matrix is:\n```\n2 7 5 1 7 0\n```\n\nEnclosed within triple angle brackets, the final matrix is:\n<<<2 7 5 1 7 0>>>"
