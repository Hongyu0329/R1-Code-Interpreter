    "\nassistant > Let's perform the series of operations on the given matrix step by step.\n\nThe initial matrix is:\n```\n2 5 1 2 6 5\n3 4 5 1 9 2\n7 9 0 3 2 9\n```\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: No change to the matrix.\n   ```\n   2 5 1 2 6 5\n   3 4 5 1 9 2\n   7 9 0 3 2 9\n   ```\n\n2. **Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed)**: Remove the second row.\n   ```\n   2 5 1 2 6 5\n   7 9 0 3 2 9\n   ```\n\n3. **Map each occurrence of 1 to 9**:\n   ```\n   2 5 9 2 6 5\n   7 9 0 3 2 9\n   ```\n\n4. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: Swap elements across the counterdiagonal.\n   ```\n   9 2\n   5 6\n   2 3\n   5 9\n   9 0\n   2 7\n   ```\n\n5. **Rotate the matrix 270 degrees**: Rotate the matrix 270 degrees clockwise.\n   ```\n   2 9 5 2 5 9\n   7 0 9 3 6 2\n   ```\n\n6. **Crop the matrix to rows 1-1 and columns 1-2 (1-indexed)**: Select the first row and first two columns.\n   ```\n   2 9\n   ```\n\n7. **Map each occurrence of 1 to 2**: There are no 1s to map to 2s, so no change.\n   ```\n   2 9\n   ```\n\n8. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: Swap elements across the diagonal.\n   ```\n   2 9\n   ```\n\n9. **Crop the matrix to rows 2-2 and columns 1-1 (1-indexed)**: Select the second row and first column.\n   ```\n   9\n   ```\n\nThe final matrix after performing all the operations is:\n```\n9\n```\n\nEnclosed within triple angle brackets, the output is:\n```\n<<<9>>>\n```"
