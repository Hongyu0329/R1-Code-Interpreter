    "\nassistant > Let's perform the series of operations on the given matrix step by step.\n\nThe initial matrix is:\n```\n2 1 9\n5 5 8\n```\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: No change to the matrix.\n   ```\n   2 1 9\n   5 5 8\n   ```\n\n2. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: The counterdiagonal of a matrix is the diagonal from the top-right to the bottom-left. Mirroring along this diagonal involves swapping elements symmetrically across this line.\n   ```\n   8 5\n   9 5 1\n   2\n   ```\n\n3. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: Perform the same operation again.\n   ```\n   2 1 9\n   5 5 8\n   ```\n\n4. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: Perform the same operation again.\n   ```\n   8 5\n   9 5 1\n   2\n   ```\n\n5. **Map each occurrence of 8 to 9**: Replace all 8s with 9s.\n   ```\n   9 5\n   9 5 1\n   2\n   ```\n\n6. **Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed)**: Remove the second row.\n   ```\n   9 5\n   2\n   ```\n\n7. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: Perform the operation again.\n   ```\n   2 9\n   5\n   ```\n\n8. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: The diagonal is from the top-left to the bottom-right. Mirroring along this diagonal involves swapping elements symmetrically across this line.\n   ```\n   2 9\n   5\n   ```\n\nThe final matrix is:\n```\n2 9\n5\n```\n\nEnclosed within triple angle brackets, the final matrix is:\n```\n<<<2 9\n5>>>\n```"
