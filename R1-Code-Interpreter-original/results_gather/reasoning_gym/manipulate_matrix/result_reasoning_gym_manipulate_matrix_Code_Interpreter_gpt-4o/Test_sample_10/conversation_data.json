    "\nassistant > Let's perform the specified operations on the given matrix step by step.\n\nThe initial matrix is:\n```\n4 3\n3 2\n1 8\n```\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This operation means no change to the matrix. So, the matrix remains:\n   ```\n   4 3\n   3 2\n   1 8\n   ```\n\n2. **Map each occurrence of 0 to 9**: Since there are no 0s in the matrix, this operation does not change the matrix. It remains:\n   ```\n   4 3\n   3 2\n   1 8\n   ```\n\n3. **Rotate the matrix 180 degrees**: This operation involves rotating the matrix by 180 degrees. Let's perform this operation.\n\nAfter performing the 180-degree rotation, the matrix will be transformed. Let's calculate the final matrix.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [4, 3],\n    [3, 2],\n    [1, 8]\n])\n\n# Rotate the matrix 180 degrees\nrotated_matrix = np.rot90(matrix, 2)\nrotated_matrix\nassistant > After rotating the matrix 180 degrees, the final matrix is:\n```\n8 1\n2 3\n3 4\n```\n\nEnclosed within triple angle brackets, the final matrix is:\n\n```\n<<<8 1\n2 3\n3 4>>>\n```"
