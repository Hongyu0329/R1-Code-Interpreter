    "\nassistant > Let's perform the series of operations on the given matrix step by step.\n\nThe initial matrix is:\n```\n2 4 1 2 4\n1 5 7 8 6\n6 8 6 5 6\n```\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: No change to the matrix.\n   ```\n   2 4 1 2 4\n   1 5 7 8 6\n   6 8 6 5 6\n   ```\n\n2. **Crop the matrix to rows 1-3 and columns 3-3 (1-indexed)**: This results in a single column matrix.\n   ```\n   1\n   7\n   6\n   ```\n\n3. **Map each occurrence of 0 to 7**: There are no 0s in the matrix, so no change.\n   ```\n   1\n   7\n   6\n   ```\n\n4. **Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed)**: Remove the second row.\n   ```\n   1\n   6\n   ```\n\n5. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: Since this is a single column matrix, it remains unchanged.\n   ```\n   1\n   6\n   ```\n\n6. **Rotate the matrix 360 degrees**: The matrix remains unchanged.\n   ```\n   1\n   6\n   ```\n\n7. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: Since this is a single column matrix, it remains unchanged.\n   ```\n   1\n   6\n   ```\n\n8. **Crop the matrix to rows 1-1 and columns 2-2 (1-indexed)**: This operation is not possible because the matrix has only one column. The result is an empty matrix.\n   ```\n   (empty)\n   ```\n\n9. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: The matrix is empty, so it remains unchanged.\n   ```\n   (empty)\n   ```\n\n10. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: The matrix is empty, so it remains unchanged.\n    ```\n    (empty)\n    ```\n\nThe final matrix is empty. Therefore, the output is:\n```\n<<<>>>\n```"
