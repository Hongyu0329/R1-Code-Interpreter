    "\nassistant > Let's perform the specified operations on the given matrix step by step.\n\nThe initial matrix is:\n```\n3 6 5 0 2\n0 2 1 2 1\n```\n\n### Step 1: Identity Transformation\nThis step involves no change to the matrix. So, the matrix remains:\n```\n3 6 5 0 2\n0 2 1 2 1\n```\n\n### Step 2: Set all elements divisible by 6 to zero\nIn this step, we will set any element that is divisible by 6 to zero. In the given matrix, the element `6` is divisible by 6.\n\nThe matrix after this operation is:\n```\n3 0 5 0 2\n0 2 1 2 1\n```\n\n### Step 3: Mirror the matrix along the diagonal\nSince the given matrix is not square, we will mirror it along the diagonal of a 5x5 matrix, treating missing elements as zero. The mirrored matrix will be a 5x2 matrix.\n\nLet's perform this operation and output the final matrix.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [3, 6, 5, 0, 2],\n    [0, 2, 1, 2, 1]\n])\n\n# Step 2: Set all elements divisible by 6 to zero\nmatrix[matrix % 6 == 0] = 0\n\n# Step 3: Mirror the matrix along the diagonal\n# Since the original matrix is 2x5, the mirrored matrix will be 5x2\nmirrored_matrix = np.zeros((5, 2), dtype=int)\nfor i in range(matrix.shape[0]):\n    for j in range(matrix.shape[1]):\n        mirrored_matrix[j, i] = matrix[i, j]\n\nmirrored_matrix\nassistant > The final matrix after performing all the specified operations is:\n\n```\n3 0\n0 2\n5 1\n0 2\n2 1\n```\n\nEnclosed within triple angle brackets, the matrix is represented as:\n\n<<<3 0\n0 2\n5 1\n0 2\n2 1>>>"
