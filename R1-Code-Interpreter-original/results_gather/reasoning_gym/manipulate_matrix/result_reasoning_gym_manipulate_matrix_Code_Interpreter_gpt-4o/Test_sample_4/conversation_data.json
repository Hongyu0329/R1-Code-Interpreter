    "\nassistant > Let's perform the series of operations on the given matrix step by step.\n\nThe initial matrix is:\n```\n0 4\n1 0\n8 2\n3 4\n6 5\n8 4\n8 1\n```\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: No change to the matrix.\n   ```\n   0 4\n   1 0\n   8 2\n   3 4\n   6 5\n   8 4\n   8 1\n   ```\n\n2. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: This operation swaps the elements across the counterdiagonal (from top-right to bottom-left). For a 2-column matrix, this operation swaps the columns.\n   ```\n   4 0\n   0 1\n   2 8\n   4 3\n   5 6\n   4 8\n   1 8\n   ```\n\n3. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: Repeating the same operation as above, which will revert the matrix to its previous state.\n   ```\n   0 4\n   1 0\n   8 2\n   3 4\n   6 5\n   8 4\n   8 1\n   ```\n\n4. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: This operation swaps the rows and columns. For a 2-column matrix, it will swap the elements within each row.\n   ```\n   0 1\n   4 0\n   8 3\n   2 4\n   6 8\n   5 4\n   8 1\n   ```\n\n5. **Crop the matrix to rows 2-2 and columns 4-5 (1-indexed)**: This operation is not possible because the matrix has only 2 columns. The result is an empty matrix.\n\n6. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: This operation is not applicable to an empty matrix. The result remains an empty matrix.\n\n7. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: This operation is not applicable to an empty matrix. The result remains an empty matrix.\n\n8. **Crop the matrix to rows 2-2 and columns 1-1 (1-indexed)**: This operation is not applicable to an empty matrix. The result remains an empty matrix.\n\n9. **Crop the matrix to rows 1-1 and columns 1-1 (1-indexed)**: This operation is not applicable to an empty matrix. The result remains an empty matrix.\n\n10. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: This operation is not applicable to an empty matrix. The result remains an empty matrix.\n\n11. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: This operation is not applicable to an empty matrix. The result remains an empty matrix.\n\nThe final matrix after performing all the operations is an empty matrix. Therefore, the output is:\n```\n<<<>>>\n```"
