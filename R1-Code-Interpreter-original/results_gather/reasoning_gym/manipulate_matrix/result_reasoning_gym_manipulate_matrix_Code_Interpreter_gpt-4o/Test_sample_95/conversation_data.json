    "\nassistant > Let's perform the series of operations on the given matrix step by step.\n\nThe initial matrix is:\n```\n0 0 4\n3 6 3\n```\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: No change to the matrix.\n   ```\n   0 0 4\n   3 6 3\n   ```\n\n2. **Set all elements divisible by 5 to zero**: There are no elements divisible by 5, so the matrix remains unchanged.\n   ```\n   0 0 4\n   3 6 3\n   ```\n\n3. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: This operation swaps the rows and columns (transpose of the matrix).\n   ```\n   0 3\n   0 6\n   4 3\n   ```\n\n4. **Rotate the matrix 270 degrees**: This is equivalent to rotating the matrix 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n   ```\n   3 6 3\n   0 0 4\n   ```\n\n5. **Remove every 2-nd column (1-indexed)**: Remove the 2nd column.\n   ```\n   3 3\n   0 4\n   ```\n\n6. **Remove every 2-nd column (1-indexed)**: Remove the 2nd column again.\n   ```\n   3\n   0\n   ```\n\nThe final matrix after performing all the operations is:\n```\n3\n0\n```\n\nEnclosed within triple angle brackets, the final matrix is:\n```\n<<<3\n0>>>\n```"
