    "\nassistant > Let's perform the series of operations on the given matrix step by step:\n\n1. **Identity Transformation**: This operation does not change the matrix, so the matrix remains the same.\n\n2. **Rotate the Matrix 360 Degrees**: Rotating a matrix 360 degrees also results in no change to the matrix.\n\n3. **Mirror the Matrix Along the Diagonal**: This operation involves transposing the matrix, which means swapping rows with columns.\n\nLet's apply these operations to the given matrix:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n7 & 7 & 2 & 5 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n9 & 3 & 6 & 6 & 3 & 6 \\\\\n1 & 8 & 5 & 4 & 6 & 7 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nWe'll transpose the matrix to get the final result.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [7, 7, 2, 5, 1, 2],\n    [9, 3, 6, 6, 3, 6],\n    [1, 8, 5, 4, 6, 7]\n])\n\n# Transpose the matrix (mirror along the diagonal)\ntransposed_matrix = matrix.T\n\n# Convert the transposed matrix to the desired format\nformatted_matrix = '<<<' + '\\n'.join(' '.join(map(str, row)) for row in transposed_matrix) + '>>>'\nformatted_matrix\nassistant > The final matrix after performing all the operations is:\n\n```\n<<<7 9 1\n7 3 8\n2 6 5\n5 6 4\n1 3 6\n2 6 7>>>\n```"
