    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's break down the steps:\n\n### Step 1: Identity Transformation\n- The identity transformation means no change to the matrix. Therefore, the matrix remains the same after this step.\n\nThe matrix is:\n```\n8 7 9\n2 7 4\n9 1 7\n6 8 8\n3 7 1\n0 4 6\n```\n\n### Step 2: Mirror the Matrix Along the Counterdiagonal\n- The counterdiagonal of a matrix is the diagonal that runs from the bottom-left to the top-right.\n- To mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal, we need to swap elements symmetrically across this diagonal.\n\nFor a 6x3 matrix, the counterdiagonal mirroring involves swapping elements such that the element at position (i, j) is swapped with the element at position (n-j-1, m-i-1), where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns.\n\nLet's perform the mirroring:\n\n1. The element at (0, 0) swaps with the element at (2, 5).\n2. The element at (0, 1) swaps with the element at (1, 5).\n3. The element at (0, 2) swaps with the element at (0, 5).\n4. The element at (1, 0) swaps with the element at (2, 4).\n5. The element at (1, 1) swaps with the element at (1, 4).\n6. The element at (1, 2) swaps with the element at (0, 4).\n7. The element at (2, 0) swaps with the element at (2, 3).\n8. The element at (2, 1) swaps with the element at (1, 3).\n9. The element at (2, 2) swaps with the element at (0, 3).\n\nAfter performing these swaps, the matrix becomes:\n```\n6 1 9\n4 7 2\n0 8 8\n7 7 9\n3 4 2\n6 1 8\n```\n\n### Final Matrix\nThe final matrix after performing all the operations is:\n\n```\n6 1 9\n4 7 2\n0 8 8\n7 7 9\n3 4 2\n6 1 8\n```\n\nEnclosing the final matrix within triple angle brackets, the output is:\n\n<<<6 1 9\n4 7 2\n0 8 8\n7 7 9\n3 4 2\n6 1 8>>>"
