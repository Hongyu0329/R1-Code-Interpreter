    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of matrix transformations step by step. Let's analyze each operation carefully:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   9 6 2 9 8\n   2 5 4 2 6\n   0 9 6 2 0\n   ```\n\n2. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: The counterdiagonal runs from the bottom-left to the top-right. After mirroring, the matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   0 2 9\n   9 5 6\n   6 4 2\n   2 2 0\n   8 6 9\n   ```\n\n3. **Remove every 4-th row (1-indexed)**: The 4th row is `2 2 0`. Removing it, the matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   0 2 9\n   9 5 6\n   6 4 2\n   8 6 9\n   ```\n\n4. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: After this operation, the matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   9 6 0 8\n   5 4 2 6\n   2 9 6 9\n   ```\n\n5. **Vertically mirror the matrix**: This operation flips the matrix upside down. The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   2 9 6 9\n   5 4 2 6\n   9 6 0 8\n   ```\n\n6. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: This operation swaps rows with columns. The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   2 5 9\n   9 4 6\n   6 2 0\n   9 6 8\n   ```\n\n7. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: After this operation, the matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   9 6 2\n   6 4 5\n   0 2 9\n   8 9 6\n   ```\n\n8. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: This operation flips the matrix left to right. The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   2 6 9\n   5 4 6\n   9 2 0\n   6 9 8\n   ```\n\n9. **Remove every 4-th column (1-indexed)**: The 4th column is not present in a 3-column matrix, so no column is removed. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   2 6 9\n   5 4 6\n   9 2 0\n   6 9 8\n   ```\n\nThe final matrix after all operations is:\n```\n2 6 9\n5 4 6\n9 2 0\n6 9 8\n```\n\nEnclosing the final matrix within triple angle brackets, the answer is:\n\n<<<2 6 9\n5 4 6\n9 2 0\n6 9 8>>>"
