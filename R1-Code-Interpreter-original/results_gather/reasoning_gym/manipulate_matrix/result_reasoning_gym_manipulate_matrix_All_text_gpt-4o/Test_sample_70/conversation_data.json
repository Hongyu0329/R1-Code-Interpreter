    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's break down each step:\n\n1. **Identity Transformation**: This step means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains as it is:\n   ```\n   2 8 9 2 6 4 9\n   6 9 9 0 8 8 9\n   8 2 6 7 3 8 2\n   1 0 2 9 9 7 8\n   ```\n\n2. **Crop the Matrix**: We need to crop the matrix to rows 2-3 and columns 5-6 (1-indexed). This means we take:\n   - Rows 2 and 3 (1-indexed), which correspond to the second and third rows in 0-indexed format.\n   - Columns 5 and 6 (1-indexed), which correspond to the fourth and fifth columns in 0-indexed format.\n\n   The cropped matrix is:\n   ```\n   8 8\n   3 8\n   ```\n\n3. **Set Elements Divisible by 2 to Zero**: We replace all elements divisible by 2 with zero:\n   - In the first row, both 8 and 8 are divisible by 2, so they become 0.\n   - In the second row, 8 is divisible by 2, so it becomes 0. The number 3 is not divisible by 2, so it remains unchanged.\n\n   The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   0 0\n   3 0\n   ```\n\n4. **Vertically Mirror the Matrix**: Vertically mirroring the matrix means flipping it upside down:\n   - The first row becomes the second row, and the second row becomes the first row.\n\n   The matrix after vertical mirroring is:\n   ```\n   3 0\n   0 0\n   ```\n\n5. **Rotate the Matrix 270 Degrees**: Rotating a matrix 270 degrees clockwise is equivalent to rotating it 90 degrees counterclockwise. This involves:\n   - Transposing the matrix (swapping rows with columns).\n   - Reversing the order of the rows.\n\n   The transposed matrix is:\n   ```\n   3 0\n   0 0\n   ```\n\n   After reversing the order of the rows, the final matrix is:\n   ```\n   0 3\n   0 0\n   ```\n\nThe final matrix, after performing all the operations, is:\n\n<<<0 3\n0 0>>>"
