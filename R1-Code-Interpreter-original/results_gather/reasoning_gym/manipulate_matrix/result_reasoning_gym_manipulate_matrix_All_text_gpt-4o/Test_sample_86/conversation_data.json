    "To solve the problem, we need to apply a series of transformations to the given matrix step by step. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: No change to the matrix.\n   ```\n   1 5 4 0 4 5\n   0 9 7 8 9 5\n   9 8 2 9 8 0\n   3 9 2 6 4 1\n   ```\n\n2. **Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed)**: Remove rows 2 and 4.\n   ```\n   1 5 4 0 4 5\n   9 8 2 9 8 0\n   ```\n\n3. **Map each occurrence of 5 to 9**: Replace all 5s with 9s.\n   ```\n   1 9 4 0 4 9\n   9 8 2 9 8 0\n   ```\n\n4. **Crop the matrix to rows 2-2 and columns 1-4 (1-indexed)**: Select row 2 and columns 1 to 4.\n   ```\n   9 8 2 9\n   ```\n\n5. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: Reverse the order of columns.\n   ```\n   9 2 8 9\n   ```\n\n6. **Set all elements divisible by 1 to zero**: Since all numbers are divisible by 1, set all elements to zero.\n   ```\n   0 0 0 0\n   ```\n\n7. **Remove every 3-th column (1-indexed)**: Remove the 3rd column.\n   ```\n   0 0 0\n   ```\n\n8. **Rotate the matrix 90 degrees**: Rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise.\n   ```\n   0\n   0\n   0\n   ```\n\n9. **Rotate the matrix 180 degrees**: Rotate the matrix 180 degrees.\n   ```\n   0\n   0\n   0\n   ```\n\n10. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: Since the matrix is a single column, it remains unchanged.\n    ```\n    0\n    0\n    0\n    ```\n\n11. **Crop the matrix to rows 1-1 and columns 1-2 (1-indexed)**: Select row 1 and columns 1 to 2. However, since there is only one column, the result is:\n    ```\n    0\n    ```\n\nThe final matrix after performing all the operations is:\n```\n0\n```\n\nEnclosed within triple angle brackets, the final output is:\n<<<0>>>"
