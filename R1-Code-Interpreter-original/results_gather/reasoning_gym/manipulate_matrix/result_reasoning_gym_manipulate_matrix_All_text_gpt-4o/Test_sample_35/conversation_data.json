    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity Transformation**: This operation means no change to the matrix. So, the matrix remains the same:\n   ```\n   6 7 6\n   4 9 6\n   7 9 4\n   ```\n\n2. **Set all elements divisible by 3 to zero**: We need to identify elements divisible by 3 and set them to zero. The elements divisible by 3 are 6, 9, and 6. After setting these to zero, the matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   0 7 0\n   4 0 0\n   7 0 4\n   ```\n\n3. **Vertically mirror the matrix**: This operation involves flipping the matrix along its vertical axis. The first column becomes the last, and the last column becomes the first. The matrix after this operation is:\n   ```\n   0 7 0\n   0 0 4\n   4 0 7\n   ```\n\n4. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: This operation involves flipping the matrix along its horizontal axis. The first row becomes the last, and the last row becomes the first. The matrix after this operation is:\n   ```\n   4 0 7\n   0 0 4\n   0 7 0\n   ```\n\n5. **Horizontally mirror the matrix again**: Repeating the horizontal mirroring operation will flip the matrix back to its previous state. The matrix after this operation is:\n   ```\n   0 7 0\n   0 0 4\n   4 0 7\n   ```\n\nAfter performing all the operations, the final matrix is:\n```\n0 7 0\n0 0 4\n4 0 7\n```\n\nEnclosing the final matrix within triple angle brackets, the output is:\n\n<<<0 7 0\n0 0 4\n4 0 7>>>"
