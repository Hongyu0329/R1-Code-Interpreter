    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's go through each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity Transformation**: This step implies no change to the matrix. The matrix remains the same as initially provided.\n\n   ```\n   1 1 5 7 5 0 9 2\n   9 5 5 4 5 9 4 7\n   9 6 3 9 1 8 7 2\n   6 8 3 0 6 5 8 9\n   8 0 2 7 1 4 1 2\n   7 1 1 6 4 2 5 7\n   6 7 4 4 2 6 4 2\n   5 1 3 8 9 3 4 0\n   ```\n\n2. **Remove Every 5-th Row (1-indexed)**: We need to remove the 5th row from the matrix. The 5th row is `8 0 2 7 1 4 1 2`.\n\n   After removing the 5th row, the matrix becomes:\n\n   ```\n   1 1 5 7 5 0 9 2\n   9 5 5 4 5 9 4 7\n   9 6 3 9 1 8 7 2\n   6 8 3 0 6 5 8 9\n   7 1 1 6 4 2 5 7\n   6 7 4 4 2 6 4 2\n   5 1 3 8 9 3 4 0\n   ```\n\n3. **Remove Every 3-th Column (1-indexed)**: We need to remove the 3rd, 6th, and 9th columns (if they exist). The 3rd column is `5 5 3 3 1 4 3`, and the 6th column is `0 9 8 5 2 6 3`.\n\n   After removing these columns, the matrix becomes:\n\n   ```\n   1 1 7 5 9 2\n   9 5 4 5 4 7\n   9 6 9 1 7 2\n   6 8 0 6 8 9\n   7 1 6 4 5 7\n   6 7 4 2 4 2\n   5 1 8 9 4 0\n   ```\n\n4. **Crop the Matrix to Rows 7-7 and Columns 1-6 (1-indexed)**: We need to extract only the 7th row and the first 6 columns from the current matrix.\n\n   The 7th row is `5 1 8 9 4 0`.\n\n   Therefore, the final matrix after all operations is:\n\n   ```\n   5 1 8 9 4 0\n   ```\n\nThe final matrix, formatted as requested, is:\n\n<<<5 1 8 9 4 0>>>"
