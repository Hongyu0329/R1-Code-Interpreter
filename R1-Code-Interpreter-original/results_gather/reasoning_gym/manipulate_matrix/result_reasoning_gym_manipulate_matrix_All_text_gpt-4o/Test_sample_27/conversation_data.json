    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's go through each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity Transformation**: This step means we do nothing to the matrix. The matrix remains the same:\n   ```\n   7 0 2\n   4 0 9\n   0 7 6\n   7 8 4\n   2 9 5\n   ```\n\n2. **Remove Every 2-nd Column (1-indexed)**: We remove the second column from the matrix. The columns are indexed as follows: 1 (first column), 2 (second column), 3 (third column). After removing the second column, the matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   7 2\n   4 9\n   0 6\n   7 4\n   2 5\n   ```\n\n3. **Horizontally Mirror the Matrix**: This operation involves reversing the order of columns in each row. After mirroring, the matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   2 7\n   9 4\n   6 0\n   4 7\n   5 2\n   ```\n\n4. **Set All Elements Divisible by 6 to Zero**: We need to check each element in the matrix and set it to zero if it is divisible by 6. In this matrix, the number 6 is divisible by 6. After setting it to zero, the matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   2 7\n   9 4\n   0 0\n   4 7\n   5 2\n   ```\n\nFinally, we format the matrix as specified, enclosed within triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<2 7\n9 4\n0 0\n4 7\n5 2>>>"
