    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's break down each step:\n\n1. **Identity Transformation**: This step means we do not change the matrix. We simply take the matrix as it is:\n\n   ```\n   0 2 0 6 4 5 0 5 2 6\n   4 6 0 8 7 9 6 0 3 3\n   1 6 5 3 2 6 3 5 8 4\n   6 2 1 7 8 9 1 6 9 8\n   7 1 9 7 1 2 8 6 3 2\n   7 8 0 7 6 5 9 7 1 2\n   ```\n\n2. **Map each occurrence of 0 to 9**: We replace every 0 in the matrix with 9. The matrix becomes:\n\n   ```\n   9 2 9 6 4 5 9 5 2 6\n   4 6 9 8 7 9 6 9 3 3\n   1 6 5 3 2 6 3 5 8 4\n   6 2 1 7 8 9 1 6 9 8\n   7 1 9 7 1 2 8 6 3 2\n   7 8 9 7 6 5 9 7 1 2\n   ```\n\n3. **Vertically mirror the matrix**: This operation involves flipping the matrix along its vertical axis. Each row is reversed. The matrix after this operation is:\n\n   ```\n   6 2 5 9 5 4 6 9 2 9\n   3 3 9 6 9 7 8 9 6 4\n   4 8 5 3 6 2 3 5 6 1\n   8 9 6 1 9 8 7 1 2 6\n   2 3 6 8 2 1 7 9 1 7\n   2 1 7 9 5 6 7 9 8 7\n   ```\n\nFinally, we format the matrix as specified, enclosed within triple angle brackets:\n\n```\n<<<6 2 5 9 5 4 6 9 2 9\n3 3 9 6 9 7 8 9 6 4\n4 8 5 3 6 2 3 5 6 1\n8 9 6 1 9 8 7 1 2 6\n2 3 6 8 2 1 7 9 1 7\n2 1 7 9 5 6 7 9 8 7>>>\n```"
