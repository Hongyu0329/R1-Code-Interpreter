    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of transformations on the given matrix. Let's go through each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains the same:\n   ```\n   6 7 4 8 1\n   8 6 8 5 0\n   1 8 1 2 7\n   0 8 6 9 3\n   4 4 5 5 8\n   1 6 8 7 4\n   2 3 4 6 7\n   3 2 7 3 1\n   ```\n\n2. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: This means transposing the matrix. The rows become columns:\n   ```\n   6 8 1 0 4 1 2 3\n   7 6 8 8 4 6 3 2\n   4 8 1 6 5 8 4 7\n   8 5 2 9 5 7 6 3\n   1 0 7 3 8 4 7 1\n   ```\n\n3. **Vertically mirror the matrix**: This means reversing the order of the rows:\n   ```\n   1 0 7 3 8 4 7 1\n   8 5 2 9 5 7 6 3\n   4 8 1 6 5 8 4 7\n   7 6 8 8 4 6 3 2\n   6 8 1 0 4 1 2 3\n   ```\n\n4. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: Transpose the matrix again:\n   ```\n   1 8 4 7 6\n   0 5 8 6 8\n   7 2 1 8 1\n   3 9 6 8 0\n   8 5 5 4 4\n   4 7 8 6 1\n   7 6 4 3 2\n   1 3 7 2 3\n   ```\n\n5. **Vertically mirror the matrix**: Reverse the order of the rows again:\n   ```\n   1 3 7 2 3\n   7 6 4 3 2\n   4 7 8 6 1\n   8 5 5 4 4\n   3 9 6 8 0\n   7 2 1 8 1\n   0 5 8 6 8\n   1 8 4 7 6\n   ```\n\n6. **Crop the matrix to rows 5-6 and columns 1-5 (1-indexed)**: Extract the submatrix from rows 5-6 and columns 1-5:\n   ```\n   3 9 6 8 0\n   7 2 1 8 1\n   ```\n\n7. **Vertically mirror the matrix**: Reverse the order of the rows:\n   ```\n   7 2 1 8 1\n   3 9 6 8 0\n   ```\n\n8. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: Reverse the order of the columns in each row:\n   ```\n   1 8 1 2 7\n   0 8 6 9 3\n   ```\n\n9. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: Swap elements across the counterdiagonal (bottom-left to top-right):\n   ```\n   0 8\n   1 8\n   6 1\n   9 2\n   3 7\n   ```\n\nThe final matrix after all transformations is:\n```\n0 8\n1 8\n6 1\n9 2\n3 7\n```\n\nEnclosed within triple angle brackets, the final output is:\n<<<0 8\n1 8\n6 1\n9 2\n3 7>>>"
