    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's go through each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   4 7 8 8 2\n   9 8 5 8 7\n   7 4 1 4 6\n   4 8 7 0 9\n   ```\n\n2. **Remove every 3rd row (1-indexed)**: We remove the 3rd row.\n   ```\n   4 7 8 8 2\n   9 8 5 8 7\n   4 8 7 0 9\n   ```\n\n3. **Remove every 3rd column (1-indexed)**: We remove the 3rd column.\n   ```\n   4 7 8 2\n   9 8 8 7\n   4 8 0 9\n   ```\n\n4. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: Reverse each row.\n   ```\n   2 8 7 4\n   7 8 8 9\n   9 0 8 4\n   ```\n\n5. **Rotate the matrix 270 degrees**: This is equivalent to rotating 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n   ```\n   4 9 7\n   8 0 8\n   7 8 8\n   2 4 9\n   ```\n\n6. **Remove every 2nd column (1-indexed)**: Remove the 2nd column.\n   ```\n   4 7\n   8 8\n   7 8\n   2 9\n   ```\n\n7. **Crop the matrix to rows 1-3 and columns 1-2 (1-indexed)**: Take the first 3 rows and first 2 columns.\n   ```\n   4 7\n   8 8\n   7 8\n   ```\n\n8. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: Swap rows and columns.\n   ```\n   4 8 7\n   7 8 8\n   ```\n\nThe final matrix after all operations is:\n```\n4 8 7\n7 8 8\n```\n\nEnclosing the final matrix within triple angle brackets, the output is:\n<<<4 8 7\n7 8 8>>>"
