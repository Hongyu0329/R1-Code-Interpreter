    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of transformations on the given matrix. Let's go through each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains the same:\n   ```\n   7 6 2 5 3 8\n   7 0 6 9 3 7\n   7 4 5 3 3 9\n   2 7 8 5 6 9\n   6 4 0 1 1 3\n   4 6 1 9 0 1\n   3 4 8 7 0 4\n   6 8 2 4 8 6\n   2 8 9 1 3 9\n   ```\n\n2. **Vertically mirror the matrix**: This means reversing the order of the rows.\n   ```\n   2 8 9 1 3 9\n   6 8 2 4 8 6\n   3 4 8 7 0 4\n   4 6 1 9 0 1\n   6 4 0 1 1 3\n   2 7 8 5 6 9\n   7 4 5 3 3 9\n   7 0 6 9 3 7\n   7 6 2 5 3 8\n   ```\n\n3. **Set all elements divisible by 3 to zero**: Replace elements divisible by 3 with zero.\n   ```\n   2 8 0 1 0 0\n   0 8 2 4 8 0\n   0 4 8 7 0 4\n   4 0 1 0 0 1\n   0 4 0 1 1 0\n   2 7 8 5 0 0\n   7 4 5 0 0 0\n   7 0 0 0 0 7\n   7 0 2 5 0 8\n   ```\n\n4. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: Swap elements across the counterdiagonal (from top-right to bottom-left).\n   ```\n   0 0 0 0 0 2\n   0 0 0 0 8 8\n   0 0 0 8 4 2\n   0 0 1 1 4 1\n   0 0 1 0 0 0\n   0 0 7 5 8 0\n   0 4 5 8 7 0\n   7 0 0 0 0 7\n   8 7 2 5 0 7\n   ```\n\n5. **Vertically mirror the matrix**: Reverse the order of the rows again.\n   ```\n   8 7 2 5 0 7\n   7 0 0 0 0 7\n   0 4 5 8 7 0\n   0 0 7 5 8 0\n   0 0 1 0 0 0\n   0 0 1 1 4 1\n   0 0 0 8 4 2\n   0 0 0 0 8 8\n   0 0 0 0 0 2\n   ```\n\n6. **Set all elements divisible by 2 to zero**: Replace elements divisible by 2 with zero.\n   ```\n   0 7 0 5 0 7\n   7 0 0 0 0 7\n   0 0 5 0 7 0\n   0 0 7 5 0 0\n   0 0 1 0 0 0\n   0 0 1 1 0 1\n   0 0 0 0 0 0\n   0 0 0 0 0 0\n   0 0 0 0 0 0\n   ```\n\nThe final matrix after performing all the operations is:\n```\n0 7 0 5 0 7\n7 0 0 0 0 7\n0 0 5 0 7 0\n0 0 7 5 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 0 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nThe final answer, formatted as requested, is:\n<<<0 7 0 5 0 7\n7 0 0 0 0 7\n0 0 5 0 7 0\n0 0 7 5 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 0 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
