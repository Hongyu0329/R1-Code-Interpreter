    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of transformations on the given matrix. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity Transformation**: This operation means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains the same:\n   ```\n   3 0 3 7 6\n   5 4 4 7 9\n   6 4 9 1 0\n   7 3 7 1 7\n   8 6 5 0 1\n   ```\n\n2. **Mirror the Matrix Along the Diagonal**: This operation involves transposing the matrix, which means swapping rows with columns. The element at position (i, j) becomes the element at position (j, i). The transposed matrix is:\n   ```\n   3 5 6 7 8\n   0 4 4 3 6\n   3 4 9 7 5\n   7 7 1 1 0\n   6 9 0 7 1\n   ```\n\n3. **Horizontally Mirror the Matrix**: This operation involves flipping the matrix horizontally, which means reversing the order of columns in each row. The horizontally mirrored matrix is:\n   ```\n   8 7 6 5 3\n   6 3 4 4 0\n   5 7 9 4 3\n   0 1 1 7 7\n   1 7 0 9 6\n   ```\n\n4. **Vertically Mirror the Matrix**: This operation involves flipping the matrix vertically, which means reversing the order of rows. The vertically mirrored matrix is:\n   ```\n   1 7 0 9 6\n   0 1 1 7 7\n   5 7 9 4 3\n   6 3 4 4 0\n   8 7 6 5 3\n   ```\n\nAfter performing all the operations, the final matrix is:\n\n```\n1 7 0 9 6\n0 1 1 7 7\n5 7 9 4 3\n6 3 4 4 0\n8 7 6 5 3\n```\n\nEnclosing the final matrix within triple angle brackets, the output is:\n\n<<<1 7 0 9 6\n0 1 1 7 7\n5 7 9 4 3\n6 3 4 4 0\n8 7 6 5 3>>>"
