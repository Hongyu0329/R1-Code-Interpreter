    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of transformations on the given matrix. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity Transformation**: This means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains as it is:\n   ```\n   8 8\n   7 0\n   4 1\n   3 7\n   5 6\n   7 4\n   3 7\n   4 7\n   2 2\n   ```\n\n2. **Mirror the Matrix Along the Diagonal**: This operation involves swapping the rows and columns, effectively transposing the matrix. The original matrix has 9 rows and 2 columns, so the transposed matrix will have 2 rows and 9 columns:\n   ```\n   8 7 4 3 5 7 3 4 2\n   8 0 1 7 6 4 7 7 2\n   ```\n\n3. **Mirror the Matrix Along the Diagonal Again**: Performing the diagonal mirror again will transpose the matrix back to its original form:\n   ```\n   8 8\n   7 0\n   4 1\n   3 7\n   5 6\n   7 4\n   3 7\n   4 7\n   2 2\n   ```\n\n4. **Vertically Mirror the Matrix**: This operation involves flipping the matrix upside down. The last row becomes the first, the second last becomes the second, and so on:\n   ```\n   2 2\n   4 7\n   3 7\n   7 4\n   5 6\n   3 7\n   4 1\n   7 0\n   8 8\n   ```\n\n5. **Mirror the Matrix Along the Diagonal**: Transpose the matrix again, swapping rows and columns:\n   ```\n   2 4 3 7 5 3 4 7 8\n   2 7 7 4 6 7 1 0 8\n   ```\n\n6. **Remove Every 2-nd Row (1-indexed)**: This means removing rows 2, 4, 6, etc., from the matrix. After removing these rows, the matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   2 4 3 7 5 3 4 7 8\n   2 7 7 4 6 7 1 0 8\n   ```\n\nThe final matrix after performing all the operations is:\n```\n2 4 3 7 5 3 4 7 8\n2 7 7 4 6 7 1 0 8\n```\n\nEnclosing the final matrix within triple angle brackets, the output is:\n<<<2 4 3 7 5 3 4 7 8\n2 7 7 4 6 7 1 0 8>>>"
