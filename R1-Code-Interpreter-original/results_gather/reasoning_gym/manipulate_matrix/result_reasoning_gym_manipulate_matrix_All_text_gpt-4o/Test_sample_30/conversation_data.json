    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   The given matrix is:\n   ```\n   3 7 4\n   5 2 8\n   2 2 0\n   4 2 1\n   ```\n\n2. **Identity Transformation:**\n   - The identity transformation means no change to the matrix. Therefore, after this step, the matrix remains the same:\n   ```\n   3 7 4\n   5 2 8\n   2 2 0\n   4 2 1\n   ```\n\n3. **Mirror the Matrix along the Counterdiagonal:**\n   - The counterdiagonal of a matrix is the diagonal that runs from the bottom-left to the top-right. For a 4x3 matrix, the counterdiagonal elements are (4,1), (2,2), and (3,3) if it were a square matrix. However, since this is a non-square matrix, we need to consider the elements that would be swapped if the matrix were square.\n   - To mirror along the counterdiagonal, we swap elements symmetrically across this diagonal. For a 4x3 matrix, the transformation involves:\n     - Swap (1,3) with (3,1)\n     - Swap (2,3) with (3,2)\n     - Swap (1,2) with (2,1)\n     - Swap (1,1) with (4,3)\n     - Swap (2,1) with (3,2)\n     - Swap (3,1) with (4,2)\n   - Applying these swaps to the matrix:\n     - Swap (1,3) with (3,1): Swap 4 with 2\n     - Swap (2,3) with (3,2): Swap 8 with 2\n     - Swap (1,2) with (2,1): Swap 7 with 5\n     - Swap (1,1) with (4,3): Swap 3 with 1\n     - Swap (2,1) with (3,2): Swap 5 with 2\n     - Swap (3,1) with (4,2): Swap 2 with 2 (no change)\n   - After performing these swaps, the matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   1 5 2\n   2 2 8\n   4 8 0\n   3 2 7\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Matrix:**\n   - The final matrix after all operations is:\n   ```\n   1 5 2\n   2 2 8\n   4 8 0\n   3 2 7\n   ```\n\n5. **Output the Final Matrix:**\n   - The final matrix should be formatted as specified, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<1 5 2\n2 2 8\n4 8 0\n3 2 7>>>"
