    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of matrix transformations step by step. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   2 3 6 2\n   8 6 1 8\n   9 5 5 7\n   0 2 5 6\n   1 2 6 6\n   ```\n\n2. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: The counterdiagonal runs from the bottom-left to the top-right. After mirroring, the matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   1 0 9 2\n   2 2 5 3\n   6 5 5 6\n   6 7 8 2\n   6 8 7 2\n   ```\n\n3. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: This means flipping the matrix over its horizontal axis. The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   6 8 7 2\n   6 7 8 2\n   6 5 5 6\n   2 2 5 3\n   1 0 9 2\n   ```\n\n4. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: Again, mirror along the counterdiagonal:\n   ```\n   2 3 6 2\n   9 5 5 6\n   8 2 7 6\n   7 8 6 6\n   2 8 6 6\n   ```\n\n5. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: Flip the matrix over its horizontal axis:\n   ```\n   2 8 6 6\n   7 8 6 6\n   8 2 7 6\n   9 5 5 6\n   2 3 6 2\n   ```\n\n6. **Crop the matrix to rows 2-5 and columns 4-4 (1-indexed)**: This means we take rows 2 to 5 and only column 4:\n   ```\n   6\n   6\n   6\n   6\n   ```\n\n7. **Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed)**: Remove rows 2 and 4:\n   ```\n   6\n   6\n   ```\n\n8. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: Since the matrix is a single column, mirroring along the diagonal doesn't change it:\n   ```\n   6\n   6\n   ```\n\nThe final matrix after all operations is:\n```\n6\n6\n```\n\nEnclosing the final matrix within triple angle brackets, the output is:\n<<<6\n6>>>"
