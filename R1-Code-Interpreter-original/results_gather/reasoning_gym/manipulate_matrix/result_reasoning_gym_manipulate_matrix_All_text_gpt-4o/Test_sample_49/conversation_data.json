    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's go through each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains the same.\n\n2. **Crop the matrix to rows 8-10 and columns 7-9 (1-indexed)**:\n   - The original matrix is 10x9.\n   - Cropping to rows 8-10 and columns 7-9 gives us:\n     ```\n     9 5 0\n     6 0 6\n     5 4 9\n     ```\n\n3. **Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed)**:\n   - Remove the 2nd row from the cropped matrix:\n     ```\n     9 5 0\n     5 4 9\n     ```\n\n4. **Vertically mirror the matrix**:\n   - Reverse the order of the rows:\n     ```\n     5 4 9\n     9 5 0\n     ```\n\n5. **Remove every 3-th column (1-indexed)**:\n   - Remove the 3rd column:\n     ```\n     5 4\n     9 5\n     ```\n\n6. **Remove every 2-nd column (1-indexed)**:\n   - Remove the 2nd column:\n     ```\n     5\n     9\n     ```\n\n7. **Set all elements divisible by 9 to zero**:\n   - The number 9 is divisible by 9, so set it to zero:\n     ```\n     5\n     0\n     ```\n\n8. **Crop the matrix to rows 1-1 and columns 1-1 (1-indexed)**:\n   - This results in a single element matrix:\n     ```\n     5\n     ```\n\n9. **Crop the matrix to rows 1-1 and columns 1-1 (1-indexed)**:\n   - The matrix remains the same:\n     ```\n     5\n     ```\n\n10. **Map each occurrence of 2 to 7**:\n    - There are no 2s in the matrix, so no change:\n      ```\n      5\n      ```\n\n11. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**:\n    - A single element matrix remains the same when mirrored:\n      ```\n      5\n      ```\n\nThe final matrix after all operations is a single element matrix containing the number 5.\n\nThe final output is:\n```\n<<<5>>>\n```"
