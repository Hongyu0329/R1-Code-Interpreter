    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's go through each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity Transformation**: This step means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains as it is:\n\n   ```\n   5 0 9 0 8 0 0 4\n   5 0 1 7 7 1 5 3\n   4 2 4 6 8 3 2 1\n   3 9 8 2 1 2 1 1\n   8 8 4 9 1 0 7 1\n   ```\n\n2. **Horizontally Mirror the Matrix**: This operation involves reversing each row of the matrix:\n\n   ```\n   4 0 0 8 0 9 0 5\n   3 5 1 7 7 1 0 5\n   1 2 3 8 6 4 2 4\n   1 1 2 1 2 8 9 3\n   1 7 0 1 9 4 8 8\n   ```\n\n3. **Remove Every 3rd Column (1-indexed)**: We remove the 3rd, 6th, and 9th columns (if they existed). After removing these columns, the matrix becomes:\n\n   ```\n   4 0 8 0 5\n   3 5 7 7 5\n   1 2 8 6 4\n   1 1 1 2 3\n   1 7 1 9 8\n   ```\n\n4. **Map Each Occurrence of 3 to 5**: We replace every occurrence of the number 3 with 5:\n\n   ```\n   4 0 8 0 5\n   5 5 7 7 5\n   1 2 8 6 4\n   1 1 1 2 5\n   1 7 1 9 8\n   ```\n\n5. **Rotate the Matrix 180 Degrees**: This involves flipping the matrix upside down and then reversing each row:\n\n   - First, flip the matrix upside down:\n\n     ```\n     1 7 1 9 8\n     1 1 1 2 5\n     1 2 8 6 4\n     5 5 7 7 5\n     4 0 8 0 5\n     ```\n\n   - Then, reverse each row:\n\n     ```\n     8 9 1 7 1\n     5 2 1 1 1\n     4 6 8 2 1\n     5 7 7 5 5\n     5 0 8 0 4\n     ```\n\nThe final matrix after performing all the operations is:\n\n```\n8 9 1 7 1\n5 2 1 1 1\n4 6 8 2 1\n5 7 7 5 5\n5 0 8 0 4\n```\n\nEnclosing the final matrix within triple angle brackets, the output is:\n\n<<<8 9 1 7 1\n5 2 1 1 1\n4 6 8 2 1\n5 7 7 5 5\n5 0 8 0 4>>>"
