    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's break down each step:\n\n### Step 1: Identity Transformation\n- The identity transformation means no change to the matrix. So, the matrix remains the same:\n  ```\n  0 5 7 8 1 7 9 4 6 6\n  7 2 0 1 6 1 8 4 5 6\n  9 9 5 9 0 8 9 3 8 6\n  ```\n\n### Step 2: Rotate the Matrix 270 Degrees\n- Rotating a matrix 270 degrees clockwise is equivalent to rotating it 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n- To rotate 90 degrees counterclockwise, we take the last column and make it the first row, the second last column becomes the second row, and so on.\n- The transformation is as follows:\n  ```\n  Original Matrix:\n  0 5 7 8 1 7 9 4 6 6\n  7 2 0 1 6 1 8 4 5 6\n  9 9 5 9 0 8 9 3 8 6\n\n  After 270-degree rotation:\n  6 6 6\n  6 5 8\n  4 4 3\n  9 8 9\n  7 1 0\n  1 6 9\n  8 1 5\n  7 0 9\n  5 2 9\n  0 7 9\n  ```\n\n### Step 3: Rotate the Matrix 180 Degrees\n- Rotating a matrix 180 degrees means flipping it upside down and reversing each row.\n- Applying this to the matrix obtained from the previous step:\n  ```\n  Matrix after 270-degree rotation:\n  6 6 6\n  6 5 8\n  4 4 3\n  9 8 9\n  7 1 0\n  1 6 9\n  8 1 5\n  7 0 9\n  5 2 9\n  0 7 9\n\n  After 180-degree rotation:\n  9 7 0\n  9 2 5\n  9 0 7\n  5 1 8\n  9 6 1\n  0 1 7\n  9 8 9\n  3 4 4\n  8 5 6\n  6 6 6\n  ```\n\n### Final Matrix\n- The final matrix after performing all the operations is:\n  ```\n  9 7 0\n  9 2 5\n  9 0 7\n  5 1 8\n  9 6 1\n  0 1 7\n  9 8 9\n  3 4 4\n  8 5 6\n  6 6 6\n  ```\n\nEnclosing the final matrix within triple angle brackets, the output is:\n\n<<<9 7 0\n9 2 5\n9 0 7\n5 1 8\n9 6 1\n0 1 7\n9 8 9\n3 4 4\n8 5 6\n6 6 6>>>"
