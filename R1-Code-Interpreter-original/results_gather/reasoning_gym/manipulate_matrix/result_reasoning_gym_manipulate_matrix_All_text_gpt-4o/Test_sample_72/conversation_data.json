    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's break down each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   The given matrix is:\n   ```\n   3 6 5 0 2\n   0 2 1 2 1\n   ```\n\n2. **Identity Transformation:**\n   The identity transformation means no change to the matrix. So, the matrix remains:\n   ```\n   3 6 5 0 2\n   0 2 1 2 1\n   ```\n\n3. **Set All Elements Divisible by 6 to Zero:**\n   We need to check each element in the matrix to see if it is divisible by 6. If it is, we set it to zero.\n   - In the first row, the element `6` is divisible by 6, so it becomes `0`.\n   - In the second row, there are no elements divisible by 6.\n   \n   After this operation, the matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   3 0 5 0 2\n   0 2 1 2 1\n   ```\n\n4. **Mirror the Matrix Along the Diagonal:**\n   The diagonal of a matrix is the line of elements from the top left to the bottom right. Mirroring along the diagonal means swapping elements across this line. However, the given matrix is not square (it has 2 rows and 5 columns), so we interpret this operation as transposing the matrix, which involves swapping rows with columns.\n\n   The transposed matrix is:\n   ```\n   3 0\n   0 2\n   5 1\n   0 2\n   2 1\n   ```\n\n5. **Final Matrix:**\n   After performing all the operations, the final matrix is:\n   ```\n   3 0\n   0 2\n   5 1\n   0 2\n   2 1\n   ```\n\nNow, we format the final matrix as specified, enclosed within triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<3 0\n0 2\n5 1\n0 2\n2 1>>>"
