    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Input Matrix:**\n   The given matrix is:\n   ```\n   8 7\n   5 6\n   0 2\n   2 6\n   2 5\n   7 0\n   ```\n\n2. **Operation 1: Identity Transformation**\n   - The identity transformation means no change is made to the matrix. So, after this operation, the matrix remains the same:\n     ```\n     8 7\n     5 6\n     0 2\n     2 6\n     2 5\n     7 0\n     ```\n\n3. **Operation 2: Map Each Occurrence of 7 to 0**\n   - We need to replace every occurrence of the number 7 in the matrix with the number 0. Let's apply this transformation:\n     - In the first row, the number 7 is replaced with 0: `8 0`\n     - In the second row, there is no 7, so it remains: `5 6`\n     - In the third row, there is no 7, so it remains: `0 2`\n     - In the fourth row, there is no 7, so it remains: `2 6`\n     - In the fifth row, there is no 7, so it remains: `2 5`\n     - In the sixth row, the number 7 is replaced with 0: `0 0`\n\n   After applying this operation, the matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   8 0\n   5 6\n   0 2\n   2 6\n   2 5\n   0 0\n   ```\n\n4. **Format the Output:**\n   - The final matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets and formatted to match the input matrix format. Therefore, the final output is:\n   \n   <<<8 0\n   5 6\n   0 2\n   2 6\n   2 5\n   0 0>>>"
