    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix and analyze each step carefully. Let's break down each operation:\n\n1. **Identity Transformation**: This operation means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains the same:\n   ```\n   6 1 5 8 8 0 0\n   4 2 7 0 8 8 3\n   9 4 9 5 6 0 3\n   ```\n\n2. **Rotate the Matrix 360 Degrees**: Rotating a matrix 360 degrees results in the matrix remaining unchanged. Therefore, the matrix is still:\n   ```\n   6 1 5 8 8 0 0\n   4 2 7 0 8 8 3\n   9 4 9 5 6 0 3\n   ```\n\n3. **Mirror the Matrix Along the Diagonal**: Mirroring a matrix along the diagonal (also known as transposing the matrix) involves swapping the rows and columns. The original matrix is 3x7, so after transposing, it becomes 7x3:\n   ```\n   6 4 9\n   1 2 4\n   5 7 9\n   8 0 5\n   8 8 6\n   0 8 0\n   0 3 3\n   ```\n\n4. **Mirror the Matrix Along the Diagonal Again**: Performing another diagonal mirror (transpose) on the 7x3 matrix will convert it back to a 3x7 matrix, effectively reversing the previous transpose:\n   ```\n   6 1 5 8 8 0 0\n   4 2 7 0 8 8 3\n   9 4 9 5 6 0 3\n   ```\n\nAfter performing all the operations, the final matrix is the same as the original matrix. Therefore, the final matrix is:\n\n<<<6 1 5 8 8 0 0\n4 2 7 0 8 8 3\n9 4 9 5 6 0 3>>>"
