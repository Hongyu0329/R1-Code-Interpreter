    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of transformations on the given matrix. Let's go through each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains the same:\n   ```\n   8 1 6 4 0 6 1\n   5 9 9 1 2 3 8\n   7 7 3 3 8 0 2\n   7 9 3 6 1 0 7\n   4 6 1 2 1 2 1\n   9 5 1 8 9 6 3\n   2 9 7 5 0 2 7\n   ```\n\n2. **Rotate the matrix 360 degrees**: A 360-degree rotation results in the matrix remaining unchanged:\n   ```\n   8 1 6 4 0 6 1\n   5 9 9 1 2 3 8\n   7 7 3 3 8 0 2\n   7 9 3 6 1 0 7\n   4 6 1 2 1 2 1\n   9 5 1 8 9 6 3\n   2 9 7 5 0 2 7\n   ```\n\n3. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: This operation flips the matrix along its vertical axis:\n   ```\n   1 6 0 4 6 1 8\n   8 3 2 1 9 9 5\n   2 0 8 3 3 7 7\n   7 0 1 6 3 9 7\n   1 2 1 2 1 6 4\n   3 6 9 8 1 5 9\n   7 2 0 5 7 9 2\n   ```\n\n4. **Crop the matrix to rows 1-4 and columns 5-7 (1-indexed)**: This means we take the submatrix from the first four rows and the last three columns:\n   ```\n   6 1 8\n   9 9 5\n   3 7 7\n   3 9 7\n   ```\n\n5. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: Flip the submatrix along its vertical axis:\n   ```\n   8 1 6\n   5 9 9\n   7 7 3\n   7 9 3\n   ```\n\n6. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: The counterdiagonal runs from the bottom-left to the top-right. We swap elements symmetrically across this diagonal:\n   - The element at (1,3) swaps with (3,1)\n   - The element at (1,2) swaps with (2,1)\n   - The element at (2,3) swaps with (3,2)\n\n   Applying these swaps, the matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   3 7 7\n   9 9 5\n   6 1 8\n   ```\n\nThe final matrix after all transformations is:\n```\n3 7 7\n9 9 5\n6 1 8\n```\n\nEnclosing the final matrix in triple angle brackets, the answer is:\n\n<<<3 7 7\n9 9 5\n6 1 8>>>"
