    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity Transformation**: This operation means no change to the matrix. So, the matrix remains the same:\n   ```\n   5 8 9 5\n   4 9 2 5\n   3 6 2 0\n   ```\n\n2. **Mirror the Matrix Along the Counterdiagonal**: The counterdiagonal of a matrix runs from the top-right to the bottom-left. To mirror along this diagonal, we swap elements symmetrically across this line. The transformation is as follows:\n   - The element at (1,4) swaps with (4,1), (1,3) with (3,1), and so on.\n   - The resulting matrix is:\n     ```\n     0 2 9 5\n     2 9 8 4\n     5 5 6 3\n     ```\n\n3. **Rotate the Matrix 90 Degrees**: Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transposing the matrix and then reversing each row. The steps are:\n   - Transpose the matrix:\n     ```\n     0 2 5\n     2 9 5\n     9 8 6\n     5 4 3\n     ```\n   - Reverse each row to get the 90-degree rotation:\n     ```\n     5 9 2 0\n     4 9 2 2\n     3 6 8 9\n     ```\n\n4. **Crop the Matrix to Rows 1-3 and Columns 3-3 (1-indexed)**: This means we only take the third column from the first three rows:\n   - The cropped matrix is:\n     ```\n     2\n     2\n     8\n     ```\n\n5. **Remove Every 3rd Row (1-indexed)**: We remove the third row from the matrix obtained in the previous step:\n   - The final matrix is:\n     ```\n     2\n     2\n     ```\n\nNow, we format the final matrix as specified, enclosed within triple angle brackets:\n\nThe final answer is: <<<2\n2>>>"
