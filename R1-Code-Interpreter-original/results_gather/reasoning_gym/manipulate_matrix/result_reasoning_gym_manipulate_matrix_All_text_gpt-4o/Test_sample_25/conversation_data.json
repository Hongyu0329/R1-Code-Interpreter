    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   9 9 0 3 8 5 7\n   4 6 6 0 2 8 9\n   ```\n\n2. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: This operation involves swapping elements across the main diagonal. The main diagonal elements are those where the row index equals the column index. After mirroring, the matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   9 4\n   9 6\n   0 6\n   3 0\n   8 2\n   5 8\n   7 9\n   ```\n\n3. **Remove every 2-nd column (1-indexed)**: In a 1-indexed system, the 2nd column is removed. The matrix now becomes:\n   ```\n   9\n   9\n   0\n   3\n   8\n   5\n   7\n   ```\n\n4. **Map each occurrence of 9 to 2**: Replace all 9s with 2s. The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   2\n   2\n   0\n   3\n   8\n   5\n   7\n   ```\n\n5. **Map each occurrence of 2 to 6**: Replace all 2s with 6s. The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   6\n   6\n   0\n   3\n   8\n   5\n   7\n   ```\n\n6. **Map each occurrence of 2 to 6**: Since there are no 2s left, this step does not change the matrix.\n\n7. **Map each occurrence of 2 to 6**: Again, since there are no 2s left, this step does not change the matrix.\n\nThe final matrix after all operations is:\n```\n6\n6\n0\n3\n8\n5\n7\n```\n\nEnclosing the final matrix within triple angle brackets, the output is:\n\n<<<6\n6\n0\n3\n8\n5\n7>>>"
