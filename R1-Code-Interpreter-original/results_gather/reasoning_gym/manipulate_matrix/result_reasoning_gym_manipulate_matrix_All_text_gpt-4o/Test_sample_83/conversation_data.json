    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's go through each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   1 8 1 5 8\n   4 4 5 7 0\n   8 8 2 2 0\n   4 2 7 9 3\n   2 2 2 8 3\n   2 6 0 3 8\n   ```\n\n2. **Set all elements divisible by 5 to zero**: We replace elements divisible by 5 with zero:\n   ```\n   1 8 1 0 8\n   4 4 0 7 0\n   8 8 2 2 0\n   4 2 7 9 3\n   2 2 2 8 3\n   2 6 0 3 8\n   ```\n\n3. **Map each occurrence of 3 to 4**: Replace all 3s with 4s:\n   ```\n   1 8 1 0 8\n   4 4 0 7 0\n   8 8 2 2 0\n   4 2 7 9 4\n   2 2 2 8 4\n   2 6 0 4 8\n   ```\n\n4. **Remove every 5-th row (1-indexed)**: Remove the 5th row:\n   ```\n   1 8 1 0 8\n   4 4 0 7 0\n   8 8 2 2 0\n   4 2 7 9 4\n   2 6 0 4 8\n   ```\n\n5. **Remove every 3-th row (1-indexed)**: Remove the 3rd row:\n   ```\n   1 8 1 0 8\n   4 4 0 7 0\n   4 2 7 9 4\n   2 6 0 4 8\n   ```\n\n6. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: The counterdiagonal runs from the bottom-left to the top-right. After mirroring, the matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   8 0 1 8\n   0 7 4 4\n   4 9 7 2\n   8 4 0 6\n   ```\n\n7. **Set all elements divisible by 3 to zero**: Replace elements divisible by 3 with zero:\n   ```\n   8 0 1 8\n   0 7 4 4\n   4 0 7 2\n   8 4 0 0\n   ```\n\nThe final matrix after all operations is:\n```\n8 0 1 8\n0 7 4 4\n4 0 7 2\n8 4 0 0\n```\n\nEnclosing the final matrix within triple angle brackets, the output is:\n<<<8 0 1 8\n0 7 4 4\n4 0 7 2\n8 4 0 0>>>"
