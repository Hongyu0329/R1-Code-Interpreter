    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's go through each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains the same.\n\n2. **Crop the matrix to rows 6-9 and columns 3-4 (1-indexed)**:\n   - Rows 6-9 (1-indexed) correspond to rows 5-8 (0-indexed).\n   - Columns 3-4 (1-indexed) correspond to columns 2-3 (0-indexed).\n   - The cropped matrix is:\n     ```\n     1 0\n     9 6\n     1 0\n     4 9\n     ```\n\n3. **Remove every 2-nd column (1-indexed)**:\n   - Remove the 2nd column (1-indexed), which is the 1st column (0-indexed).\n   - The resulting matrix is:\n     ```\n     1\n     9\n     1\n     4\n     ```\n\n4. **Vertically mirror the matrix**:\n   - Reverse the order of the rows.\n   - The resulting matrix is:\n     ```\n     4\n     1\n     9\n     1\n     ```\n\n5. **Remove every 4-th row (1-indexed)**:\n   - Remove the 4th row (1-indexed), which is the 3rd row (0-indexed).\n   - The resulting matrix is:\n     ```\n     4\n     1\n     1\n     ```\n\n6. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**:\n   - Since the matrix is a single column, mirroring along the diagonal does not change it.\n   - The matrix remains:\n     ```\n     4\n     1\n     1\n     ```\n\n7. **Remove every 2-nd column (1-indexed)**:\n   - There is only one column, so this operation does not apply.\n   - The matrix remains:\n     ```\n     4\n     1\n     1\n     ```\n\n8. **Map each occurrence of 3 to 5**:\n   - There are no 3s in the matrix, so no changes are made.\n   - The matrix remains:\n     ```\n     4\n     1\n     1\n     ```\n\n9. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**:\n   - Again, since the matrix is a single column, mirroring along the diagonal does not change it.\n   - The final matrix is:\n     ```\n     4\n     1\n     1\n     ```\n\nThe final matrix after performing all the operations is:\n\n<<<4\n1\n1>>>"
