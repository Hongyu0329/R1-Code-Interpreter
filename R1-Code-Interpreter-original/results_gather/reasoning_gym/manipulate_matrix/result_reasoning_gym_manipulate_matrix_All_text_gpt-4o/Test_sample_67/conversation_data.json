    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's break down each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains the same.\n\n2. **Set all elements divisible by 3 to zero**: We replace every element in the matrix that is divisible by 3 with zero. The resulting matrix is:\n   ```\n   0  0  2  0  0  2  1  4\n   0  8  8  1  0  7  0  0\n   0  0  0  5  0  0  2  0\n   2  0  5  1  0  1  7  5\n   0  0  4  0  0  0  0  5\n   0  1  7  0  0  0  7  0\n   5  2  0  2  7  0  2  0\n   2  0  1  0  2  7  0  1\n   ```\n\n3. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: This operation transposes the matrix. The resulting matrix is:\n   ```\n   0  0  0  2  0  0  5  2\n   0  8  0  0  0  1  2  0\n   2  8  0  5  4  7  0  1\n   0  1  5  1  0  0  2  0\n   0  0  0  0  0  0  7  2\n   2  7  0  1  0  0  0  7\n   1  0  2  7  0  7  2  0\n   4  0  0  5  5  0  0  1\n   ```\n\n4. **Rotate the matrix 270 degrees**: This is equivalent to rotating the matrix 90 degrees counterclockwise. The resulting matrix is:\n   ```\n   2  0  1  2  0  0  0  0\n   0  2  0  7  0  0  8  0\n   1  0  0  0  0  5  0  0\n   7  2  0  0  0  1  0  2\n   0  0  0  0  0  0  4  5\n   7  0  0  0  0  0  7  0\n   2  0  0  2  0  0  0  5\n   0  0  0  0  0  0  2  1\n   ```\n\n5. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: This operation flips the matrix horizontally. The resulting matrix is:\n   ```\n   0  0  0  0  2  0  1  2\n   0  8  0  0  7  0  2  0\n   0  0  5  0  0  0  0  1\n   2  0  1  0  0  0  2  7\n   5  4  0  0  0  0  0  0\n   0  7  0  0  0  0  0  7\n   5  0  0  0  2  0  0  2\n   1  2  0  0  0  0  0  0\n   ```\n\n6. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: This operation reflects the matrix along the counterdiagonal (from top-right to bottom-left). The resulting matrix is:\n   ```\n   2  0  0  0  0  0  0  1\n   0  2  0  0  0  0  7  0\n   1  0  0  0  0  5  0  0\n   2  7  0  0  0  1  0  2\n   0  0  0  0  0  0  4  5\n   0  0  0  0  0  0  7  0\n   0  0  0  0  2  0  0  5\n   0  0  0  0  0  0  2  1\n   ```\n\n7. **Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed)**: We remove the 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 8th rows. The resulting matrix is:\n   ```\n   2  0  0  0  0  0  0  1\n   1  0  0  0  0  5  0  0\n   0  0  0  0  0  0  4  5\n   0  0  0  0  2  0  0  5\n   ```\n\n8. **Set all elements divisible by 8 to zero**: We replace every element in the matrix that is divisible by 8 with zero. The resulting matrix is:\n   ```\n   2  0  0  0  0  0  0  1\n   1  0  0  0  0  5  0  0\n   0  0  0  0  0  0  4  5\n   0  0  0  0  2  0  0  5\n   ```\n\nThe final matrix, formatted as specified, is:\n\n<<<2 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\n1 0 0 0 0 5 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 4 5\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 5>>>"
