    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains the same.\n\n2. **Rotate the matrix 180 degrees**: This involves flipping the matrix upside down and then reversing each row. The resulting matrix is:\n   ```\n   4 1 6 2 0 4\n   5 4 5 0 2 0\n   7 7 6 3 3 9\n   5 9 5 5 2 1\n   2 8 2 1 4 0\n   9 7 3 4 7 8\n   1 3 6 5 8 7\n   8 7 3 8 3 4\n   ```\n\n3. **Map each occurrence of 8 to 6**: Replace all 8s with 6s. The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   4 1 6 2 0 4\n   5 4 5 0 2 0\n   7 7 6 3 3 9\n   5 9 5 5 2 1\n   2 6 2 1 4 0\n   9 7 3 4 7 6\n   1 3 6 5 6 7\n   6 7 3 6 3 4\n   ```\n\n4. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: The counterdiagonal runs from the bottom-left to the top-right. After mirroring, the matrix is:\n   ```\n   4 0 3 1 2 5 9 4\n   1 5 3 9 6 7 4 1\n   6 5 6 5 2 3 5 6\n   2 0 5 3 1 6 0 2\n   0 2 2 3 4 6 5 0\n   4 0 9 7 7 3 5 4\n   7 2 7 6 5 6 3 6\n   8 1 9 5 7 9 0 4\n   ```\n\n5. **Map each occurrence of 6 to 5**: Replace all 6s with 5s. The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   4 0 3 1 2 5 9 4\n   1 5 3 9 5 7 4 1\n   5 5 5 5 2 3 5 5\n   2 0 5 3 1 5 0 2\n   0 2 2 3 4 5 5 0\n   4 0 9 7 7 3 5 4\n   7 2 7 5 5 5 3 5\n   8 1 9 5 7 9 0 4\n   ```\n\n6. **Vertically mirror the matrix**: Flip the matrix upside down. The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   8 1 9 5 7 9 0 4\n   7 2 7 5 5 5 3 5\n   4 0 9 7 7 3 5 4\n   0 2 2 3 4 5 5 0\n   2 0 5 3 1 5 0 2\n   5 5 5 5 2 3 5 5\n   1 5 3 9 5 7 4 1\n   4 0 3 1 2 5 9 4\n   ```\n\n7. **Vertically mirror the matrix**: Flip the matrix upside down again, returning it to the previous state:\n   ```\n   4 0 3 1 2 5 9 4\n   1 5 3 9 5 7 4 1\n   5 5 5 5 2 3 5 5\n   2 0 5 3 1 5 0 2\n   0 2 2 3 4 5 5 0\n   4 0 9 7 7 3 5 4\n   7 2 7 5 5 5 3 5\n   8 1 9 5 7 9 0 4\n   ```\n\n8. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: Swap rows and columns. The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   4 1 5 2 0 4 7 8\n   0 5 5 0 2 0 2 1\n   3 3 5 5 2 9 7 9\n   1 9 5 3 3 7 5 5\n   2 5 2 1 4 7 5 7\n   5 7 3 5 5 3 5 9\n   9 4 5 0 5 5 3 0\n   4 1 5 2 0 4 5 4\n   ```\n\n9. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: Swap rows and columns again, returning it to the previous state:\n   ```\n   4 0 3 1 2 5 9 4\n   1 5 3 9 5 7 4 1\n   5 5 5 5 2 3 5 5\n   2 0 5 3 1 5 0 2\n   0 2 2 3 4 5 5 0\n   4 0 9 7 7 3 5 4\n   7 2 7 5 5 5 3 5\n   8 1 9 5 7 9 0 4\n   ```\n\n10. **Set all elements divisible by 1 to zero**: Since every integer is divisible by 1, all elements become zero. The final matrix is:\n   ```\n   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   ```\n\nThe final matrix is:\n<<<0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>>>"
