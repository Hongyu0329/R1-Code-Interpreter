    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's go through each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains the same.\n\n2. **Remove every 3rd column (1-indexed)**: We remove the 3rd, 6th, and 9th columns from the matrix. The resulting matrix is:\n   ```\n   0 3 3 2 4 7 8\n   2 0 9 7 2 9 1\n   4 5 8 8 6 0 5\n   3 2 2 8 4 7 9\n   3 7 8 1 9 3 9\n   0 1 9 4 3 3 7\n   1 7 9 7 8 9 1\n   0 2 6 2 1 6 9\n   0 6 8 3 7 3 2\n   ```\n\n3. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: Reverse each row of the matrix. The resulting matrix is:\n   ```\n   8 7 4 2 3 3 0\n   1 9 2 7 9 0 2\n   5 0 6 8 8 5 4\n   9 7 4 8 2 2 3\n   9 3 9 1 8 7 3\n   7 3 3 4 9 1 0\n   1 9 8 7 9 7 1\n   9 6 1 2 6 2 0\n   2 3 7 3 8 6 0\n   ```\n\n4. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: Transpose the matrix (swap rows with columns). The resulting matrix is:\n   ```\n   8 1 5 9 9 7 1 9 2\n   7 9 0 7 3 3 9 6 3\n   4 2 6 4 9 3 8 1 7\n   2 7 8 8 1 4 7 2 3\n   3 9 8 2 8 9 9 6 8\n   3 0 5 2 7 1 7 2 6\n   0 2 4 3 3 0 1 0 0\n   ```\n\n5. **Crop the matrix to rows 1-2 and columns 3-3 (1-indexed)**: This means we only take the element at the intersection of rows 1-2 and column 3. The resulting matrix is:\n   ```\n   5\n   0\n   ```\n\n6. **Remove every 2nd row (1-indexed)**: Remove the 2nd row from the matrix. The resulting matrix is:\n   ```\n   5\n   ```\n\nThe final matrix after performing all the operations is:\n```\n<<<5>>>\n```"
