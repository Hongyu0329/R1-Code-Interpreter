    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's go through each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains as it is:\n   ```\n   7 3 6 6 9 2 3\n   6 8 3 2 7 6 6\n   4 6 3 5 7 0 5\n   3 9 7 6 1 6 8\n   1 4 1 5 7 3 5\n   ```\n\n2. **Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed)**: We remove the 2nd and 4th rows (1-indexed), which are the rows with indices 1 and 3 (0-indexed). The resulting matrix is:\n   ```\n   7 3 6 6 9 2 3\n   4 6 3 5 7 0 5\n   1 4 1 5 7 3 5\n   ```\n\n3. **Crop the matrix to rows 2-3 and columns 6-7 (1-indexed)**: This means we take the submatrix from rows 1-2 (0-indexed) and columns 5-6 (0-indexed). The resulting submatrix is:\n   ```\n   0 5\n   3 5\n   ```\n\n4. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: The counterdiagonal of a 2x2 matrix is the diagonal from the top-right to the bottom-left. Mirroring along this diagonal swaps the elements across it. The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   5 3\n   5 0\n   ```\n\n5. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal again**: Repeating the same operation on the current matrix will swap the elements back to their original positions. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   0 5\n   3 5\n   ```\n\nThe final matrix after all operations is:\n```\n0 5\n3 5\n```\n\nEnclosing the final matrix within triple angle brackets, the output is:\n<<<0 5\n3 5>>>"
