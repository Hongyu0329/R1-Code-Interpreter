    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains the same.\n\n2. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: This operation involves reversing each row of the matrix. After this step, the matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   7 4 4 3 6 0 4 3 6\n   0 8 5 3 4 5 1 3 7\n   7 8 5 3 6 9 9 6 0\n   9 4 1 3 1 2 6 1 0\n   2 7 7 3 0 0 1 8 1\n   9 0 2 6 8 7 6 9 9\n   8 2 6 5 9 7 3 6 7\n   ```\n\n3. **Map each occurrence of 9 to 0**: Replace all 9s with 0s. The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   7 4 4 3 6 0 4 3 6\n   0 8 5 3 4 5 1 3 7\n   7 8 5 3 6 0 0 6 0\n   0 4 1 3 1 2 6 1 0\n   2 7 7 3 0 0 1 8 1\n   0 0 2 6 8 7 6 0 0\n   8 2 6 5 0 7 3 6 7\n   ```\n\n4. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: Reverse each row again. The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   6 3 4 0 6 3 4 4 7\n   7 3 1 5 4 3 5 8 0\n   0 6 0 0 6 3 5 8 7\n   0 1 6 2 1 3 1 4 0\n   1 8 1 0 0 3 7 7 2\n   0 0 6 7 8 6 2 0 0\n   7 6 3 7 0 5 6 2 8\n   ```\n\n5. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: Reverse each row again. The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   7 4 4 3 6 0 4 3 6\n   0 8 5 3 4 5 1 3 7\n   7 8 5 3 6 0 0 6 0\n   0 4 1 3 1 2 6 1 0\n   2 7 7 3 0 0 1 8 1\n   0 0 2 6 8 7 6 0 0\n   8 2 6 5 0 7 3 6 7\n   ```\n\n6. **Set all elements divisible by 3 to zero**: Replace elements divisible by 3 with 0. The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   7 4 4 0 0 0 4 0 0\n   0 8 5 0 4 5 1 0 7\n   7 8 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n   0 4 1 0 1 2 0 1 0\n   2 7 7 0 0 0 1 8 1\n   0 0 2 0 8 7 0 0 0\n   8 2 0 5 0 7 0 2 8\n   ```\n\n7. **Rotate the matrix 360 degrees**: A 360-degree rotation results in the same matrix. No change.\n\n8. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: Transpose the matrix. The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   7 0 7 0 2 0 8\n   4 8 8 4 7 0 2\n   4 5 5 1 7 2 0\n   0 0 0 0 0 0 5\n   0 4 0 1 0 8 0\n   0 5 0 2 0 7 0\n   4 1 0 1 1 0 8\n   0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n   0 7 0 0 1 0 8\n   ```\n\n9. **Crop the matrix to rows 3-3 and columns 5-5 (1-indexed)**: This means we take the element at the intersection of the 3rd row and 5th column. The element is `0`.\n\n10. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: Since we have a single element, this operation does not change the matrix.\n\n11. **Crop the matrix to rows 1-1 and columns 1-1 (1-indexed)**: This operation retains the single element `0`.\n\nThe final matrix after all operations is a single element matrix:\n\n```\n0\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
