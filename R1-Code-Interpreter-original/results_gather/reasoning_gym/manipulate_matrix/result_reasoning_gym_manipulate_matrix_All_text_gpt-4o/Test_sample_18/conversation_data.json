    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's go through each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains the same:\n   ```\n   5 3 7 5 1 8\n   5 3 8 1 2 5\n   1 5 5 3 3 1\n   5 9 9 6 1 1\n   9 5 6 0 3 5\n   4 6 1 3 7 4\n   9 7 2 4 9 3\n   8 9 1 6 9 1\n   8 7 6 8 8 2\n   ```\n\n2. **Map each occurrence of 8 to 4**: Replace all 8s with 4s:\n   ```\n   5 3 7 5 1 4\n   5 3 4 1 2 5\n   1 5 5 3 3 1\n   5 9 9 6 1 1\n   9 5 6 0 3 5\n   4 6 1 3 7 4\n   9 7 2 4 9 3\n   4 9 1 6 9 1\n   4 7 6 4 4 2\n   ```\n\n3. **Rotate the matrix 270 degrees**: This is equivalent to rotating the matrix 90 degrees counterclockwise. The resulting matrix is:\n   ```\n   4 9 5 1 5 5 5 3 7\n   7 9 6 5 3 3 9 5 3\n   6 1 9 5 5 8 9 7 4\n   4 6 0 3 1 1 6 1 5\n   4 9 3 3 2 1 9 2 1\n   2 3 5 1 5 4 3 5 8\n   ```\n\n4. **Crop the matrix to rows 2-2 and columns 6-6 (1-indexed)**: This means we only take the element at the second row and sixth column:\n   ```\n   8\n   ```\n\n5. **Set all elements divisible by 8 to zero**: Since 8 is divisible by 8, we set it to zero:\n   ```\n   0\n   ```\n\n6. **Vertically mirror the matrix**: Since the matrix is a single element, mirroring it vertically does not change it:\n   ```\n   0\n   ```\n\n7. **Crop the matrix to rows 1-1 and columns 1-1 (1-indexed)**: This means we only take the first element, which is:\n   ```\n   0\n   ```\n\n8. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: Again, since the matrix is a single element, this operation does not change it:\n   ```\n   0\n   ```\n\n9. **Set all elements divisible by 1 to zero**: Since 0 is divisible by 1, we set it to zero:\n   ```\n   0\n   ```\n\nThe final matrix after performing all the operations is:\n```\n0\n```\n\nEnclosing the result within triple angle brackets, the final output is:\n<<<0>>>"
