    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's break down each step:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   2 6 7 7\n   7 7 4 3\n   3 9 5 7\n   ```\n\n2. **Remove every 2-nd column (1-indexed)**: We remove the 2nd and 4th columns:\n   - Remove the 2nd column: \n     ```\n     2 7 7\n     7 4 3\n     3 5 7\n     ```\n   - Remove the 4th column (which is now the 3rd column after the previous removal):\n     ```\n     2 7\n     7 4\n     3 5\n     ```\n\n3. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: This operation transposes the matrix (swap rows with columns):\n   ```\n   2 7 3\n   7 4 5\n   ```\n\n4. **Rotate the matrix 90 degrees**: A 90-degree rotation of the matrix (clockwise) results in:\n   ```\n   3 5\n   7 4\n   2 7\n   ```\n\n5. **Remove every 3-th row (1-indexed)**: We remove the 3rd row:\n   ```\n   3 5\n   7 4\n   ```\n\nThe final matrix after all operations is:\n```\n3 5\n7 4\n```\n\nEnclosing the final matrix within triple angle brackets, the output is:\n\n<<<3 5\n7 4>>>"
