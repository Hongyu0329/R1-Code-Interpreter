    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's break down each step carefully:\n\n### Step 1: Identity Transformation\n- The identity transformation means no change to the matrix. So, the matrix remains the same:\n  ```\n  5 3 9\n  0 2 8\n  8 8 4\n  9 1 8\n  5 5 1\n  ```\n\n### Step 2: Remove Every 5-th Row (1-indexed)\n- We need to remove the 5-th row from the matrix. The 5-th row is \"5 5 1\".\n- After removing the 5-th row, the matrix becomes:\n  ```\n  5 3 9\n  0 2 8\n  8 8 4\n  9 1 8\n  ```\n\n### Step 3: Mirror the Matrix Along the Diagonal\n- Mirroring the matrix along the diagonal means converting rows to columns and vice versa (transposing the matrix).\n- The current matrix is:\n  ```\n  5 3 9\n  0 2 8\n  8 8 4\n  9 1 8\n  ```\n- Transposing this matrix involves swapping rows with columns:\n  - The first column becomes the first row: 5 0 8 9\n  - The second column becomes the second row: 3 2 8 1\n  - The third column becomes the third row: 9 8 4 8\n- The transposed matrix is:\n  ```\n  5 0 8 9\n  3 2 8 1\n  9 8 4 8\n  ```\n\n### Final Output\n- The final matrix after all operations is:\n  ```\n  5 0 8 9\n  3 2 8 1\n  9 8 4 8\n  ```\n- We need to format the output as specified, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<5 0 8 9\n3 2 8 1\n9 8 4 8>>>"
