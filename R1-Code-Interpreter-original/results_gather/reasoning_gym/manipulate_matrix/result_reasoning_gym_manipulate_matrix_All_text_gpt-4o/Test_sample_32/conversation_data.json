    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identity Transformation**: This operation means that the matrix remains unchanged. So, the matrix after this step is the same as the original matrix:\n\n   ```\n   9 6 8\n   0 3 4\n   3 2 1\n   6 7 3\n   0 1 6\n   0 1 2\n   1 9 0\n   9 4 3\n   8 3 1\n   ```\n\n2. **Crop the Matrix**: The instruction is to crop the matrix to rows 7-7 and columns 2-2, using 1-indexing. This means we need to extract the element located at the 7th row and 2nd column of the matrix.\n\n   - The 7th row of the matrix is: `1 9 0`\n   - The 2nd column of this row is `9`.\n\n   Therefore, after cropping, the resulting matrix is a single element matrix containing the value `9`.\n\n3. **Format the Output**: The final step is to format the output matrix as specified, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final matrix after performing all the operations is:\n\n<<<9>>>"
