    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's go through each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains as it is:\n   ```\n   5 7 0 8 3 9 3 4 7 3\n   5 7 1 4 3 2 1 7 8 5\n   3 7 5 3 6 6 3 1 6 7\n   4 3 1 9 5 4 6 6 3 6\n   1 6 6 0 7 3 8 1 5 0\n   ```\n\n2. **Crop the matrix to rows 1-3 and columns 10-10 (1-indexed)**: This means we take the elements from rows 1 to 3 and column 10. The resulting matrix is:\n   ```\n   3\n   5\n   7\n   ```\n\n3. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: The counterdiagonal of a matrix runs from the bottom-left to the top-right. For a single column matrix, this operation doesn't change the matrix. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   3\n   5\n   7\n   ```\n\n4. **Vertically mirror the matrix**: This operation flips the matrix upside down. The resulting matrix is:\n   ```\n   7\n   5\n   3\n   ```\n\n5. **Crop the matrix to rows 1-1 and columns 3-3 (1-indexed)**: Since our current matrix is a single column, this operation results in an empty matrix because there is no third column. The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   (empty)\n   ```\n\n6. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: Mirroring an empty matrix results in an empty matrix. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   (empty)\n   ```\n\n7. **Map each occurrence of 2 to 8**: Since the matrix is empty, there are no elements to map. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   (empty)\n   ```\n\nAfter performing all the operations, the final matrix is empty. Therefore, the output is:\n\n<<<>>>"
