    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's go through each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains the same.\n\n2. **Vertically mirror the matrix**: This operation flips the matrix along its vertical axis. The first column becomes the last, the second column becomes the second last, and so on.\n\n   Original matrix:\n   ```\n   4 4 7 1 6 1 1 3 4\n   1 4 9 0 3 2 5 3 4\n   9 0 0 9 2 3 9 8 6\n   6 5 7 3 1 0 0 5 9\n   5 1 0 9 2 9 0 6 7\n   0 5 0 5 0 5 6 1 4\n   8 8 1 3 8 3 9 6 7\n   2 0 5 3 6 5 8 2 4\n   7 1 6 2 5 2 2 4 0\n   ```\n\n   Vertically mirrored:\n   ```\n   4 3 1 1 6 1 7 4 4\n   4 3 5 2 3 0 9 4 1\n   6 8 9 3 2 9 0 0 9\n   9 5 0 0 1 3 7 5 6\n   7 6 0 9 2 9 0 1 5\n   4 1 6 5 0 5 0 5 0\n   7 6 9 3 8 3 1 8 8\n   4 2 8 5 6 3 5 0 2\n   0 4 2 2 5 2 6 1 7\n   ```\n\n3. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: This operation flips the matrix along its horizontal axis. The first row becomes the last, the second row becomes the second last, and so on.\n\n   Horizontally mirrored:\n   ```\n   0 4 2 2 5 2 6 1 7\n   4 2 8 5 6 3 5 0 2\n   7 6 9 3 8 3 1 8 8\n   4 1 6 5 0 5 0 5 0\n   7 6 0 9 2 9 0 1 5\n   9 5 0 0 1 3 7 5 6\n   6 8 9 3 2 9 0 0 9\n   4 3 5 2 3 0 9 4 1\n   4 3 1 1 6 1 7 4 4\n   ```\n\n4. **Set all elements divisible by 7 to zero**: We replace all elements that are divisible by 7 with zero.\n\n   After setting elements divisible by 7 to zero:\n   ```\n   0 4 2 2 5 2 6 1 0\n   4 2 8 5 6 3 5 0 2\n   0 6 9 3 8 3 1 8 8\n   4 1 6 5 0 5 0 5 0\n   0 6 0 9 2 9 0 1 5\n   9 5 0 0 1 3 0 5 6\n   6 8 9 3 2 9 0 0 9\n   4 3 5 2 3 0 9 4 1\n   4 3 1 1 6 1 0 4 4\n   ```\n\n5. **Remove every 6-th row (1-indexed)**: We remove the 6th row from the matrix.\n\n   After removing the 6th row:\n   ```\n   0 4 2 2 5 2 6 1 0\n   4 2 8 5 6 3 5 0 2\n   0 6 9 3 8 3 1 8 8\n   4 1 6 5 0 5 0 5 0\n   0 6 0 9 2 9 0 1 5\n   6 8 9 3 2 9 0 0 9\n   4 3 5 2 3 0 9 4 1\n   4 3 1 1 6 1 0 4 4\n   ```\n\n6. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: We flip the matrix along its horizontal axis again.\n\n   Horizontally mirrored:\n   ```\n   4 3 1 1 6 1 0 4 4\n   4 3 5 2 3 0 9 4 1\n   6 8 9 3 2 9 0 0 9\n   0 6 0 9 2 9 0 1 5\n   4 1 6 5 0 5 0 5 0\n   0 6 9 3 8 3 1 8 8\n   4 2 8 5 6 3 5 0 2\n   0 4 2 2 5 2 6 1 0\n   ```\n\n7. **Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed)**: We remove every second row from the matrix.\n\n   After removing every 2nd row:\n   ```\n   4 3 1 1 6 1 0 4 4\n   6 8 9 3 2 9 0 0 9\n   4 1 6 5 0 5 0 5 0\n   4 2 8 5 6 3 5 0 2\n   ```\n\n8. **Vertically mirror the matrix**: We flip the matrix along its vertical axis again.\n\n   Vertically mirrored:\n   ```\n   4 4 0 1 6 1 1 3 4\n   9 0 0 9 2 3 9 8 6\n   0 5 0 5 0 5 6 1 4\n   2 0 5 3 6 5 8 2 4\n   ```\n\n9. **Crop the matrix to rows 1-4 and columns 8-8 (1-indexed)**: We extract the elements from rows 1 to 4 and column 8.\n\n   Cropped matrix:\n   ```\n   3\n   8\n   1\n   2\n   ```\n\nThe final matrix after performing all the operations is:\n\n<<<3\n8\n1\n2>>>"
