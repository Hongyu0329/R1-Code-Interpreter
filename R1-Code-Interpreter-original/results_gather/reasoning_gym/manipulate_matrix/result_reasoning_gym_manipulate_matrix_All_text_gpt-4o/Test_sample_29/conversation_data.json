    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of transformations on the given matrix. Let's go through each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains as is:\n   ```\n   8 3 5 4\n   5 0 7 5\n   5 1 6 7\n   5 2 5 0\n   8 1 2 5\n   0 6 2 2\n   6 4 4 5\n   7 5 9 5\n   2 9 4 6\n   ```\n\n2. **Vertically mirror the matrix**: This means reversing the order of the rows:\n   ```\n   2 9 4 6\n   7 5 9 5\n   6 4 4 5\n   0 6 2 2\n   8 1 2 5\n   5 2 5 0\n   5 1 6 7\n   5 0 7 5\n   8 3 5 4\n   ```\n\n3. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: This means reversing the order of the columns in each row:\n   ```\n   6 4 9 2\n   5 9 5 7\n   5 4 4 6\n   2 2 6 0\n   5 2 1 8\n   0 5 2 5\n   7 6 1 5\n   5 7 0 5\n   4 5 3 8\n   ```\n\n4. **Map each occurrence of 7 to 0**: Replace all 7s with 0s:\n   ```\n   6 4 9 2\n   5 9 5 0\n   5 4 4 6\n   2 2 6 0\n   5 2 1 8\n   0 5 2 5\n   0 6 1 5\n   5 0 0 5\n   4 5 3 8\n   ```\n\n5. **Map each occurrence of 1 to 4**: Replace all 1s with 4s:\n   ```\n   6 4 9 2\n   5 9 5 0\n   5 4 4 6\n   2 2 6 0\n   5 2 4 8\n   0 5 2 5\n   0 6 4 5\n   5 0 0 5\n   4 5 3 8\n   ```\n\n6. **Remove every 3rd column (1-indexed)**: Remove the 3rd column from each row:\n   ```\n   6 4 2\n   5 9 0\n   5 4 6\n   2 2 0\n   5 2 8\n   0 5 5\n   0 6 5\n   5 0 5\n   4 5 8\n   ```\n\n7. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: Reverse the order of the columns in each row:\n   ```\n   2 4 6\n   0 9 5\n   6 4 5\n   0 2 2\n   8 2 5\n   5 5 0\n   5 6 0\n   5 0 5\n   8 5 4\n   ```\n\n8. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: The counterdiagonal runs from the bottom-left to the top-right. This operation involves swapping elements symmetrically across this diagonal:\n   ```\n   8 5 4\n   5 0 5\n   5 6 0\n   5 5 0\n   8 2 5\n   0 2 2\n   6 4 5\n   0 9 5\n   2 4 6\n   ```\n\nThe final matrix after all transformations is:\n```\n8 5 4\n5 0 5\n5 6 0\n5 5 0\n8 2 5\n0 2 2\n6 4 5\n0 9 5\n2 4 6\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<8 5 4\n5 0 5\n5 6 0\n5 5 0\n8 2 5\n0 2 2\n6 4 5\n0 9 5\n2 4 6>>>"
