    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identity Transformation**: This operation means no change to the matrix. So, the matrix remains the same as initially provided.\n\n2. **Crop the Matrix**: We need to crop the matrix to include only rows 7 to 10 and columns 4 to 6. The matrix is 1-indexed, meaning the first row and column are indexed as 1.\n\n   Let's identify the specific rows and columns:\n   - Rows 7 to 10 correspond to the following rows in the matrix:\n     - Row 7: 2 3 6 9 4 0 5\n     - Row 8: 1 4 9 4 9 7 1\n     - Row 9: 1 3 2 5 7 8 5\n     - Row 10: 6 1 0 5 6 6 5\n\n   - Columns 4 to 6 correspond to the following columns in each row:\n     - Column 4: 9, 4, 5, 5\n     - Column 5: 4, 9, 7, 6\n     - Column 6: 0, 7, 8, 6\n\n   Extracting these columns from the specified rows, we get the following cropped matrix:\n\n   ```\n   9 4 0\n   4 9 7\n   5 7 8\n   5 6 6\n   ```\n\n3. **Format the Output**: The final matrix should be formatted as specified, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final matrix after performing all the operations is:\n\n<<<9 4 0\n4 9 7\n5 7 8\n5 6 6>>>"
