    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's break down each step:\n\n1. **Identity Transformation**: This step implies no change to the matrix. The matrix remains as it is:\n\n   ```\n   7 2 6 5 6 8 1 8 1\n   1 7 4 0 3 5 3 4 3\n   2 2 3 5 5 6 3 6 7\n   8 4 6 2 1 2 0 9 6\n   ```\n\n2. **Crop the Matrix**: We need to crop the matrix to rows 2-2 and columns 3-9 (1-indexed). This means we only take the second row and columns from the third to the ninth:\n\n   - The second row is: `1 7 4 0 3 5 3 4 3`\n   - Cropping columns 3 to 9 gives us: `4 0 3 5 3 4 3`\n\n   The cropped matrix is:\n   ```\n   4 0 3 5 3 4 3\n   ```\n\n3. **Rotate the Matrix 180 Degrees**: Rotating a single row 180 degrees is equivalent to reversing the order of the elements:\n\n   - Original row: `4 0 3 5 3 4 3`\n   - Reversed row: `3 4 3 5 3 0 4`\n\n   The matrix after rotation is:\n   ```\n   3 4 3 5 3 0 4\n   ```\n\n4. **Remove Every 7-th Column (1-indexed)**: In this step, we remove the 7-th column from the matrix. Since our matrix is a single row, we remove the 7-th element:\n\n   - Original row: `3 4 3 5 3 0 4`\n   - Removing the 7-th element (which is `4`): `3 4 3 5 3 0`\n\n   The final matrix is:\n   ```\n   3 4 3 5 3 0\n   ```\n\nNow, we format the final matrix as specified, enclosed within triple angle brackets:\n\n```\n<<<3 4 3 5 3 0>>>\n```"
