    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix step by step. Let's analyze each operation carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   \\[\n   \\begin{bmatrix}\n   2 & 1 & 9 \\\\\n   5 & 5 & 8 \\\\\n   \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Identity Transformation:**\n   - This operation means no change to the matrix.\n   - Resulting matrix:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     2 & 1 & 9 \\\\\n     5 & 5 & 8 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal:**\n   - The counterdiagonal of a matrix is the diagonal from the top-right to the bottom-left.\n   - For a 2x3 matrix, mirroring along the counterdiagonal swaps elements across this diagonal.\n   - Resulting matrix:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     8 & 5 & 2 \\\\\n     9 & 5 & 1 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal again:**\n   - Repeating the same operation as above.\n   - Resulting matrix:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     1 & 5 & 9 \\\\\n     2 & 5 & 8 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal again:**\n   - Repeating the same operation once more.\n   - Resulting matrix:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     8 & 5 & 2 \\\\\n     9 & 5 & 1 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Map each occurrence of 8 to 9:**\n   - Change all 8s in the matrix to 9s.\n   - Resulting matrix:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     9 & 5 & 2 \\\\\n     9 & 5 & 1 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n\n7. **Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed):**\n   - Remove the second row of the matrix.\n   - Resulting matrix:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     9 & 5 & 2 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n\n8. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal:**\n   - For a single row, this operation does not change the matrix.\n   - Resulting matrix:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     9 & 5 & 2 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n\n9. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal:**\n   - For a single row, this operation does not change the matrix.\n   - Resulting matrix:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     9 & 5 & 2 \\\\\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n\nThe final matrix after performing all the operations is:\n\n<<<9 5 2>>>"
