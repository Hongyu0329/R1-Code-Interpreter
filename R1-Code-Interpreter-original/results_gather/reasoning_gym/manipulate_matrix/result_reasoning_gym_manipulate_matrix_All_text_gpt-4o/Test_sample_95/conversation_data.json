    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix step by step. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   \\[\n   \\begin{bmatrix}\n   0 & 0 & 4 \\\\\n   3 & 6 & 3\n   \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Identity Transformation:**\n   - This operation means no change to the matrix.\n   - Resulting matrix:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     0 & 0 & 4 \\\\\n     3 & 6 & 3\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Set all elements divisible by 5 to zero:**\n   - Check each element: none of the elements (0, 0, 4, 3, 6, 3) are divisible by 5.\n   - Resulting matrix remains unchanged:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     0 & 0 & 4 \\\\\n     3 & 6 & 3\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal:**\n   - The diagonal is from the top-left to the bottom-right.\n   - Swap elements across the diagonal:\n     - (0,1) with (1,0): 0 with 3\n     - (0,2) with (2,0): 4 with 3\n   - Resulting matrix:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     0 & 3 \\\\\n     0 & 6 \\\\\n     4 & 3\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Rotate the matrix 270 degrees:**\n   - Rotating 270 degrees clockwise is equivalent to rotating 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n   - The first column becomes the last row, the second column becomes the second row, and so on.\n   - Resulting matrix:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     3 & 6 \\\\\n     0 & 0 \\\\\n     4 & 3\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Remove every 2-nd column (1-indexed):**\n   - Remove the second column.\n   - Resulting matrix:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     3 \\\\\n     0 \\\\\n     4\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n\n7. **Remove every 2-nd column (1-indexed):**\n   - There is only one column left, so removing the second column does not change the matrix.\n   - Resulting matrix:\n     \\[\n     \\begin{bmatrix}\n     3 \\\\\n     0 \\\\\n     4\n     \\end{bmatrix}\n     \\]\n\nThe final matrix after performing all the operations is:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n3 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n4\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nOutput the final matrix in the specified format:\n\n<<<3\n0\n4>>>"
