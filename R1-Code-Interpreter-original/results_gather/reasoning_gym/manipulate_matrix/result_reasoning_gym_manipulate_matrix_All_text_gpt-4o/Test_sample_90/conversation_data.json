    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of transformations on the given matrix. Let's go through each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains the same:\n   ```\n   9 4 1 5 3\n   7 9 2 1 4\n   7 3 8 6 6\n   2 5 4 7 1\n   6 1 8 7 9\n   1 8 9 7 4\n   5 9 0 8 5\n   6 6 2 5 6\n   1 7 1 9 0\n   0 3 7 6 4\n   ```\n\n2. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: The counterdiagonal runs from the bottom-left to the top-right. After mirroring, the matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   4 7 1 6 0\n   3 9 7 6 1\n   0 2 9 8 5\n   5 7 8 1 6\n   9 7 6 4 6\n   1 4 7 8 2\n   6 6 8 3 7\n   5 1 6 9 7\n   3 4 5 2 9\n   9 1 4 5 3\n   ```\n\n3. **Vertically mirror the matrix**: This means flipping the matrix upside down. The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   9 1 4 5 3\n   3 4 5 2 9\n   5 1 6 9 7\n   6 6 8 3 7\n   1 4 7 8 2\n   9 7 6 4 6\n   5 7 8 1 6\n   0 2 9 8 5\n   3 9 7 6 1\n   4 7 1 6 0\n   ```\n\n4. **Set all elements divisible by 6 to zero**: We replace all elements divisible by 6 with zero:\n   ```\n   9 1 4 5 3\n   3 4 5 2 9\n   5 1 0 9 7\n   0 0 8 3 7\n   1 4 7 8 2\n   9 7 0 4 0\n   5 7 8 1 0\n   0 2 9 8 5\n   3 9 7 0 1\n   4 7 1 0 0\n   ```\n\n5. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: After this operation, the matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   0 1 5 3 9\n   0 0 7 4 3\n   5 8 9 2 0\n   0 1 8 7 5\n   0 4 0 8 1\n   7 4 9 8 0\n   7 3 0 0 5\n   9 5 0 1 5\n   1 9 4 7 4\n   3 5 9 1 0\n   ```\n\n6. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: Repeating the counterdiagonal mirroring, the matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   0 1 5 3 9\n   0 0 7 4 3\n   5 8 9 2 0\n   0 1 8 7 5\n   0 4 0 8 1\n   7 4 9 8 0\n   7 3 0 0 5\n   9 5 0 1 5\n   1 9 4 7 4\n   3 5 9 1 0\n   ```\n\n7. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: The diagonal runs from the top-left to the bottom-right. After mirroring, the matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   0 0 5 0 0 7 7 9 1 3\n   1 0 8 1 4 4 3 5 9 5\n   5 7 9 8 0 9 0 0 4 9\n   3 4 2 7 8 8 0 1 7 1\n   9 3 0 5 1 0 5 5 4 0\n   ```\n\nThe final matrix after all operations is:\n```\n0 0 5 0 0 7 7 9 1 3\n1 0 8 1 4 4 3 5 9 5\n5 7 9 8 0 9 0 0 4 9\n3 4 2 7 8 8 0 1 7 1\n9 3 0 5 1 0 5 5 4 0\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n<<<0 0 5 0 0 7 7 9 1 3\n1 0 8 1 4 4 3 5 9 5\n5 7 9 8 0 9 0 0 4 9\n3 4 2 7 8 8 0 1 7 1\n9 3 0 5 1 0 5 5 4 0>>>"
