    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   The matrix provided is:\n   ```\n   6 3 7 4 4 8\n   1 7 2 7 8 2\n   1 5 2 6 7 8\n   ```\n\n2. **Identity Transformation:**\n   The first operation is an identity transformation, which means no changes are made to the matrix. Therefore, the matrix remains the same:\n   ```\n   6 3 7 4 4 8\n   1 7 2 7 8 2\n   1 5 2 6 7 8\n   ```\n\n3. **Map Each Occurrence of 6 to 2:**\n   The next operation is to replace every occurrence of the number 6 with the number 2. We will go through each element of the matrix and make this substitution:\n   - First row: 6 is replaced by 2, resulting in `2 3 7 4 4 8`.\n   - Second row: No 6 is present, so it remains `1 7 2 7 8 2`.\n   - Third row: 6 is replaced by 2, resulting in `1 5 2 2 7 8`.\n\n   After performing this operation, the matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   2 3 7 4 4 8\n   1 7 2 7 8 2\n   1 5 2 2 7 8\n   ```\n\n4. **Output the Final Matrix:**\n   The final step is to output the transformed matrix in the specified format, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final matrix after all operations is:\n```\n<<<2 3 7 4 4 8\n1 7 2 7 8 2\n1 5 2 2 7 8>>>\n```"
