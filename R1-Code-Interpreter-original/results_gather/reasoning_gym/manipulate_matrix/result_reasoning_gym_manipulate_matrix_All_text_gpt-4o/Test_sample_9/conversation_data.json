    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of transformations on the given matrix. Let's go through each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains the same:\n   ```\n   3 2 6 9 4 8 4\n   6 9 0 3 0 7 2\n   2 5 2 4 9 9 0\n   1 9 0 6 4 3 1\n   5 7 2 8 0 1 1\n   2 2 0 4 5 3 9\n   0 9 9 2 6 0 4\n   6 2 1 1 6 0 7\n   ```\n\n2. **Vertically mirror the matrix**: Reverse the order of the rows.\n   ```\n   6 2 1 1 6 0 7\n   0 9 9 2 6 0 4\n   2 2 0 4 5 3 9\n   5 7 2 8 0 1 1\n   1 9 0 6 4 3 1\n   2 5 2 4 9 9 0\n   6 9 0 3 0 7 2\n   3 2 6 9 4 8 4\n   ```\n\n3. **Rotate the matrix 90 degrees**: Rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise.\n   ```\n   3 6 2 1 5 2 0 6\n   2 9 5 9 7 2 9 2\n   6 0 2 0 2 0 9 1\n   9 3 4 6 8 4 2 1\n   4 0 9 4 0 5 6 6\n   8 7 9 3 1 3 0 0\n   4 2 0 1 1 9 4 7\n   ```\n\n4. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: Swap elements across the counterdiagonal (from top-right to bottom-left).\n   ```\n   7 4 0 6 6 1 2 3\n   0 4 9 5 0 2 9 6\n   0 3 3 8 6 4 0 2\n   1 2 4 2 9 0 5 1\n   1 9 0 4 2 0 2 5\n   9 0 4 1 3 9 0 2\n   2 9 0 0 7 9 6 0\n   6 2 1 1 5 2 9 4\n   ```\n\n5. **Crop the matrix to rows 7-8 and columns 5-5 (1-indexed)**: This means we only take the elements in the 7th and 8th rows and the 5th column.\n   ```\n   7\n   5\n   ```\n\n6. **Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed)**: Remove the second row from the cropped matrix.\n   ```\n   7\n   ```\n\n7. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: Since the matrix is now a single element, this operation has no effect.\n   ```\n   7\n   ```\n\n8. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: Again, with a single element, this operation has no effect.\n   ```\n   7\n   ```\n\nThe final matrix after all operations is:\n```\n7\n```\n\nEnclosing the result within triple angle brackets, the final output is:\n<<<7>>>"
