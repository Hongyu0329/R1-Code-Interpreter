    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity Transformation**: This operation means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains the same:\n   ```\n   6 4 6\n   3 1 4\n   3 2 3\n   5 3 1\n   ```\n\n2. **Rotate the Matrix 360 Degrees**: Rotating a matrix 360 degrees results in the same matrix. So, the matrix remains unchanged:\n   ```\n   6 4 6\n   3 1 4\n   3 2 3\n   5 3 1\n   ```\n\n3. **Horizontally Mirror the Matrix**: This operation involves flipping the matrix horizontally, i.e., reversing each row:\n   ```\n   6 4 6  ->  6 4 6\n   3 1 4  ->  4 1 3\n   3 2 3  ->  3 2 3\n   5 3 1  ->  1 3 5\n   ```\n\n4. **Mirror the Matrix Along the Diagonal**: This operation involves transposing the matrix, i.e., swapping rows with columns:\n   ```\n   6 4 6  ->  6 4 3 1\n   4 1 3  ->  4 1 2 3\n   3 2 3  ->  6 3 3 5\n   1 3 5\n   ```\n\n5. **Remove Every 3rd Column (1-indexed)**: This operation involves removing the 3rd column from the transposed matrix:\n   ```\n   6 4 3 1  ->  6 4 1\n   4 1 2 3  ->  4 1 3\n   6 3 3 5  ->  6 3 5\n   ```\n\nAfter performing all the operations, the final matrix is:\n```\n6 4 1\n4 1 3\n6 3 5\n```\n\nEnclosing the final matrix within triple angle brackets, the output is:\n<<<6 4 1\n4 1 3\n6 3 5>>>"
