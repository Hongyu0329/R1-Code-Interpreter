    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's go through each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains the same.\n\n2. **Crop the matrix to rows 5-5 and columns 8-9 (1-indexed)**: \n   - The 5th row is: `2 8 7 0 6 6 3 5 1 7`\n   - Columns 8-9 in this row are: `5 1`\n   - The resulting matrix is: \n     ```\n     5 1\n     ```\n\n3. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: \n   - Mirroring `5 1` horizontally results in: `1 5`\n\n4. **Crop the matrix to rows 1-1 and columns 1-2 (1-indexed)**: \n   - The matrix is already 1 row and 2 columns, so it remains: `1 5`\n\n5. **Remove every 2-nd column (1-indexed)**: \n   - Removing the 2nd column from `1 5` results in: `1`\n\n6. **Map each occurrence of 4 to 8**: \n   - There is no 4 in the matrix `1`, so it remains unchanged: `1`\n\n7. **Rotate the matrix 360 degrees**: \n   - A 360-degree rotation results in the same matrix: `1`\n\n8. **Map each occurrence of 9 to 6**: \n   - There is no 9 in the matrix `1`, so it remains unchanged: `1`\n\n9. **Map each occurrence of 4 to 3**: \n   - There is no 4 in the matrix `1`, so it remains unchanged: `1`\n\n10. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: \n    - The counterdiagonal of a 1x1 matrix is the same as the main diagonal, so the matrix remains: `1`\n\nAfter performing all the operations, the final matrix is:\n\n```\n1\n```\n\nTherefore, the final output is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
