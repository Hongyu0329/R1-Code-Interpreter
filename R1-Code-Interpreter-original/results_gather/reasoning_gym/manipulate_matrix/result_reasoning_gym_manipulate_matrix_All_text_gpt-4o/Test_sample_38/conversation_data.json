    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity Transformation**: This operation means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains the same:\n   ```\n   7 7 2 5 1 2\n   9 3 6 6 3 6\n   1 8 5 4 6 7\n   ```\n\n2. **Rotate the Matrix 360 Degrees**: Rotating a matrix 360 degrees results in the matrix remaining unchanged. Therefore, the matrix after this operation is still:\n   ```\n   7 7 2 5 1 2\n   9 3 6 6 3 6\n   1 8 5 4 6 7\n   ```\n\n3. **Mirror the Matrix Along the Diagonal**: This operation involves reflecting the matrix over its main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right). The main diagonal elements remain in their positions, and the elements are swapped symmetrically across the diagonal. The original matrix is 3x6, so the mirrored matrix will be 6x3. Let's perform this operation:\n\n   - The element at position (1,1) remains the same.\n   - The element at position (1,2) swaps with the element at position (2,1).\n   - The element at position (1,3) swaps with the element at position (3,1).\n   - The element at position (1,4) swaps with the element at position (4,1).\n   - The element at position (1,5) swaps with the element at position (5,1).\n   - The element at position (1,6) swaps with the element at position (6,1).\n   - The element at position (2,3) swaps with the element at position (3,2).\n   - The element at position (2,4) swaps with the element at position (4,2).\n   - The element at position (2,5) swaps with the element at position (5,2).\n   - The element at position (2,6) swaps with the element at position (6,2).\n   - The element at position (3,4) swaps with the element at position (4,3).\n   - The element at position (3,5) swaps with the element at position (5,3).\n   - The element at position (3,6) swaps with the element at position (6,3).\n\n   Applying these swaps, the mirrored matrix is:\n   ```\n   7 9 1\n   7 3 8\n   2 6 5\n   5 6 4\n   1 3 6\n   2 6 7\n   ```\n\nThe final matrix after performing all the operations is:\n\n<<<7 9 1\n7 3 8\n2 6 5\n5 6 4\n1 3 6\n2 6 7>>>"
