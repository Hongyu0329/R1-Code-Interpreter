    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's go through each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   7 7 8 0 1\n   3 8 7 4 9\n   8 1 3 7 8\n   4 6 2 4 8\n   8 5 1 8 2\n   0 5 9 3 2\n   ```\n\n2. **Crop the matrix to rows 4-6 and columns 4-4 (1-indexed)**: This means we take rows 4 to 6 and only column 4. The resulting matrix is:\n   ```\n   4\n   8\n   3\n   ```\n\n3. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: For a single column matrix, this operation does not change the matrix. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   4\n   8\n   3\n   ```\n\n4. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: This operation also does not change a single column matrix. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   4\n   8\n   3\n   ```\n\n5. **Rotate the matrix 90 degrees**: Rotating a single column matrix 90 degrees clockwise results in a single row matrix:\n   ```\n   3 8 4\n   ```\n\n6. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: For a single row matrix, this operation does not change the matrix. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   3 8 4\n   ```\n\n7. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: Again, this operation does not change a single row matrix. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   3 8 4\n   ```\n\n8. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: This operation does not change a single row matrix. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   3 8 4\n   ```\n\n9. **Remove every 3rd column (1-indexed)**: The third column is removed, resulting in:\n   ```\n   3 8\n   ```\n\n10. **Set all elements divisible by 8 to zero**: The number 8 is divisible by 8, so it is set to zero:\n    ```\n    3 0\n    ```\n\n11. **Map each occurrence of 1 to 0**: There are no 1s in the matrix, so no changes are made. The matrix remains:\n    ```\n    3 0\n    ```\n\nThe final matrix after all operations is:\n```\n3 0\n```\n\nEnclosing the final matrix within triple angle brackets, the output is:\n<<<3 0>>>"
