    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity Transformation**: This operation means no change to the matrix. So, the matrix remains the same:\n   ```\n   7 8\n   4 8\n   6 3\n   1 5\n   9 1\n   5 4\n   9 3\n   0 9\n   3 0\n   9 8\n   ```\n\n2. **Mirror the Matrix Along the Diagonal**: This operation involves swapping the rows and columns. The given matrix is a 10x2 matrix, so mirroring along the diagonal will result in a 2x10 matrix:\n   ```\n   7 4 6 1 9 5 9 0 3 9\n   8 8 3 5 1 4 3 9 0 8\n   ```\n\n3. **Rotate the Matrix 180 Degrees**: Rotating a matrix 180 degrees involves flipping it upside down and reversing the order of elements in each row. Applying this to the 2x10 matrix:\n   - First, reverse the order of the rows:\n     ```\n     8 8 3 5 1 4 3 9 0 8\n     7 4 6 1 9 5 9 0 3 9\n     ```\n   - Then, reverse the order of elements in each row:\n     ```\n     8 0 9 3 4 1 5 3 8 8\n     9 3 0 9 5 9 1 6 4 7\n     ```\n\n4. **Mirror the Matrix Along the Diagonal Again**: This operation will swap the rows and columns again, converting the 2x10 matrix back to a 10x2 matrix:\n   ```\n   8 9\n   0 3\n   9 0\n   3 9\n   4 5\n   1 9\n   5 1\n   3 6\n   8 4\n   8 7\n   ```\n\nAfter performing all the operations, the final matrix is:\n\n```\n8 9\n0 3\n9 0\n3 9\n4 5\n1 9\n5 1\n3 6\n8 4\n8 7\n```\n\nEnclosing the final matrix within triple angle brackets, the output is:\n\n<<<8 9\n0 3\n9 0\n3 9\n4 5\n1 9\n5 1\n3 6\n8 4\n8 7>>>"
