    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   The given matrix is:\n   ```\n   5 1 4\n   2 3 5\n   1 7 7\n   8 4 7\n   2 5 4\n   8 9 0\n   8 0 2\n   3 7 2\n   9 6 3\n   4 4 6\n   ```\n\n2. **Identity Transformation:**\n   - The identity transformation means no change to the matrix. So, the matrix remains the same after this step.\n\n3. **Map each occurrence of 3 to 2:**\n   - We need to replace every occurrence of the number 3 in the matrix with the number 2.\n\n   Let's go through the matrix and apply this transformation:\n   - Row 1: `5 1 4` (no 3s, remains the same)\n   - Row 2: `2 3 5` becomes `2 2 5` (3 is replaced by 2)\n   - Row 3: `1 7 7` (no 3s, remains the same)\n   - Row 4: `8 4 7` (no 3s, remains the same)\n   - Row 5: `2 5 4` (no 3s, remains the same)\n   - Row 6: `8 9 0` (no 3s, remains the same)\n   - Row 7: `8 0 2` (no 3s, remains the same)\n   - Row 8: `3 7 2` becomes `2 7 2` (3 is replaced by 2)\n   - Row 9: `9 6 3` becomes `9 6 2` (3 is replaced by 2)\n   - Row 10: `4 4 6` (no 3s, remains the same)\n\n4. **Final Matrix:**\n   After performing the operations, the final matrix is:\n   ```\n   5 1 4\n   2 2 5\n   1 7 7\n   8 4 7\n   2 5 4\n   8 9 0\n   8 0 2\n   2 7 2\n   9 6 2\n   4 4 6\n   ```\n\n5. **Output the Final Matrix:**\n   - The final matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<5 1 4\n2 2 5\n1 7 7\n8 4 7\n2 5 4\n8 9 0\n8 0 2\n2 7 2\n9 6 2\n4 4 6>>>"
