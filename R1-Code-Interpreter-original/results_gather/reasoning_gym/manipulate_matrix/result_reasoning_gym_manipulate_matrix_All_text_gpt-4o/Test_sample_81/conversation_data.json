    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix step by step. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   0 7 8 5 3 6\n   0 1 4 2 9 4\n   ```\n\n2. **Remove every 4-th column (1-indexed)**: The 4th column is removed. The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   0 7 8 3 6\n   0 1 4 9 4\n   ```\n\n3. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: The counterdiagonal is from the bottom-left to the top-right. After mirroring, the matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   6 4\n   3 9\n   8 4\n   7 1\n   0 0\n   ```\n\n4. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: The diagonal is from the top-left to the bottom-right. After mirroring, the matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   6 3 8 7 0\n   4 9 4 1 0\n   ```\n\n5. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: After mirroring along the counterdiagonal again, the matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   0 1\n   7 4\n   8 9\n   3 4\n   6 0\n   ```\n\n6. **Remove every 2-nd column (1-indexed)**: The 2nd column is removed. The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   0\n   7\n   8\n   3\n   6\n   ```\n\n7. **Map each occurrence of 2 to 3**: There are no 2s in the matrix, so no change occurs. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   0\n   7\n   8\n   3\n   6\n   ```\n\n8. **Set all elements divisible by 8 to zero**: The element 8 is divisible by 8, so it is set to zero. The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   0\n   7\n   0\n   3\n   6\n   ```\n\n9. **Set all elements divisible by 3 to zero**: The elements 3 and 6 are divisible by 3, so they are set to zero. The final matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   0\n   7\n   0\n   0\n   0\n   ```\n\nThe final matrix, formatted as specified, is:\n<<<0\n7\n0\n0\n0>>>"
