    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's go through each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   6 0 3 3 6 9\n   0 4 5 2 0 4\n   1 5 0 1 6 5\n   6 1 6 8 9 4\n   4 1 7 6 4 9\n   ```\n\n2. **Map each occurrence of 0 to 3**: Replace all 0s with 3s.\n   ```\n   6 3 3 3 6 9\n   3 4 5 2 3 4\n   1 5 3 1 6 5\n   6 1 6 8 9 4\n   4 1 7 6 4 9\n   ```\n\n3. **Remove every 6-th column (1-indexed)**: Remove the 6th column.\n   ```\n   6 3 3 3 6\n   3 4 5 2 3\n   1 5 3 1 6\n   6 1 6 8 9\n   4 1 7 6 4\n   ```\n\n4. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: The counterdiagonal runs from the bottom-left to the top-right. After mirroring, the matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   4 6 1 3 6\n   1 1 5 4 3\n   7 6 3 5 3\n   6 8 1 2 3\n   4 9 6 9 6\n   ```\n\n5. **Crop the matrix to rows 4-5 and columns 3-4 (1-indexed)**: Extract the submatrix from rows 4-5 and columns 3-4.\n   ```\n   1 2\n   6 9\n   ```\n\n6. **Set all elements divisible by 8 to zero**: Check each element in the submatrix and set it to zero if divisible by 8.\n   - 1 is not divisible by 8.\n   - 2 is not divisible by 8.\n   - 6 is not divisible by 8.\n   - 9 is not divisible by 8.\n   The matrix remains unchanged:\n   ```\n   1 2\n   6 9\n   ```\n\n7. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: Reverse the order of columns in each row.\n   ```\n   2 1\n   9 6\n   ```\n\nThe final matrix after performing all the operations is:\n```\n2 1\n9 6\n```\n\nEnclosing the matrix within triple angle brackets, the final output is:\n<<<2 1\n9 6>>>"
