    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity Transformation**: This operation means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains the same as the input.\n\n   Initial matrix:\n   ```\n   5 0 1 8 4 6 1 8 1 6\n   7 0 9 3 3 5 0 2 6 4\n   ```\n\n2. **Mirror the Matrix Along the Counterdiagonal**: The counterdiagonal of a matrix is the diagonal that runs from the bottom-left to the top-right. For a 2x10 matrix, this operation involves swapping elements symmetrically across this diagonal. However, since the matrix is not square, the concept of a counterdiagonal is not directly applicable. Instead, we interpret this as swapping elements in a way that reflects across a line that would be the counterdiagonal if the matrix were square. This operation effectively transposes the matrix and then reverses the order of elements in each row.\n\n   Transpose the matrix:\n   ```\n   5 7\n   0 0\n   1 9\n   8 3\n   4 3\n   6 5\n   1 0\n   8 2\n   1 6\n   6 4\n   ```\n\n   Reverse the order of elements in each row:\n   ```\n   7 5\n   0 0\n   9 1\n   3 8\n   3 4\n   5 6\n   0 1\n   2 8\n   6 1\n   4 6\n   ```\n\n3. **Rotate the Matrix 360 Degrees**: A 360-degree rotation brings the matrix back to its original orientation. Therefore, the matrix remains unchanged after this operation.\n\n   Final matrix:\n   ```\n   7 5\n   0 0\n   9 1\n   3 8\n   3 4\n   5 6\n   0 1\n   2 8\n   6 1\n   4 6\n   ```\n\nThe final matrix after performing all the operations is:\n\n<<<7 5\n0 0\n9 1\n3 8\n3 4\n5 6\n0 1\n2 8\n6 1\n4 6>>>"
