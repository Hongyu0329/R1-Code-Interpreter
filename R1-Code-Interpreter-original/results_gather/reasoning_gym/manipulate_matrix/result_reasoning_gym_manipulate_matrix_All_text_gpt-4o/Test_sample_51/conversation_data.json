    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's go through each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity Transformation**: This step means no change is made to the matrix. The matrix remains the same as initially provided.\n\n2. **Map each occurrence of 4 to 0**: We need to replace every '4' in the matrix with '0'. Let's apply this transformation to the matrix:\n\n   ```\n   1 2 6 0 0 3 3 2 0\n   1 0 6 2 5 0 8 3 7\n   3 7 2 0 0 0 7 5 6\n   9 2 8 5 7 7 9 5 7\n   3 2 6 8 8 2 9 2 0\n   5 7 3 7 9 0 1 7 9\n   8 6 2 3 0 0 1 5 1\n   2 1 9 6 9 9 1 2 0\n   7 0 5 6 7 2 9 5 9\n   ```\n\n3. **Map each occurrence of 7 to 6**: Now, replace every '7' in the matrix with '6'. The matrix becomes:\n\n   ```\n   1 2 6 0 0 3 3 2 0\n   1 0 6 2 5 0 8 3 6\n   3 6 2 0 0 0 6 5 6\n   9 2 8 5 6 6 9 5 6\n   3 2 6 8 8 2 9 2 0\n   5 6 3 6 9 0 1 6 9\n   8 6 2 3 0 0 1 5 1\n   2 1 9 6 9 9 1 2 0\n   6 0 5 6 6 2 9 5 9\n   ```\n\n4. **Crop the matrix to rows 2-2 and columns 8-8 (1-indexed)**: This means we only take the element at the intersection of row 2 and column 8. In 1-indexed terms, this is the element in the second row and eighth column. The element is '3'.\n\n5. **Map each occurrence of 7 to 2**: Since the cropped matrix is just a single element '3', and there are no '7's to map to '2', this step does not change the matrix.\n\nThe final matrix after all operations is just the single element '3'.\n\nTherefore, the final output is:\n\n<<<3>>>"
