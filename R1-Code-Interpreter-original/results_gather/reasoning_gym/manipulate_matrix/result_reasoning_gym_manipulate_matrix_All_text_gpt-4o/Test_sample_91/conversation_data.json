    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of matrix operations on the given matrix. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   The given matrix is:\n   ```\n   1 6 4 1 0 6\n   8 8 5 5 0 2\n   ```\n\n2. **Identity Transformation:**\n   - This operation means no change to the matrix. So, the matrix remains:\n   ```\n   1 6 4 1 0 6\n   8 8 5 5 0 2\n   ```\n\n3. **Mirror the Matrix Along the Diagonal:**\n   - Mirroring along the diagonal (transpose) means converting rows to columns. The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   1 8\n   6 8\n   4 5\n   1 5\n   0 0\n   6 2\n   ```\n\n4. **Mirror the Matrix Along the Diagonal Again:**\n   - Performing another diagonal mirror (transpose) will revert the matrix back to its previous form:\n   ```\n   1 6 4 1 0 6\n   8 8 5 5 0 2\n   ```\n\n5. **Vertically Mirror the Matrix:**\n   - Vertically mirroring the matrix means flipping it upside down. The last row becomes the first row, and so on. The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   8 8 5 5 0 2\n   1 6 4 1 0 6\n   ```\n\nAfter performing all the operations, the final matrix is:\n```\n8 8 5 5 0 2\n1 6 4 1 0 6\n```\n\nEnclosing the final matrix within triple angle brackets, the output is:\n\n<<<8 8 5 5 0 2\n1 6 4 1 0 6>>>"
