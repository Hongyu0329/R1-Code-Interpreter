    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix step by step. Let's analyze each operation carefully:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   2 4 1 2 4\n   1 5 7 8 6\n   6 8 6 5 6\n   ```\n\n2. **Crop the matrix to rows 1-3 and columns 3-3 (1-indexed)**: This means we take the submatrix that includes all rows from 1 to 3 and only column 3. The resulting matrix is:\n   ```\n   1\n   7\n   6\n   ```\n\n3. **Map each occurrence of 0 to 7**: There are no zeros in the current matrix, so no changes are made. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   1\n   7\n   6\n   ```\n\n4. **Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed)**: This means we remove the second row. The resulting matrix is:\n   ```\n   1\n   6\n   ```\n\n5. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: Since the matrix is a single column, mirroring along the diagonal does not change it. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   1\n   6\n   ```\n\n6. **Rotate the matrix 360 degrees**: Rotating a matrix 360 degrees results in no change. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   1\n   6\n   ```\n\n7. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: For a single column, horizontally mirroring does not change the matrix. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   1\n   6\n   ```\n\n8. **Crop the matrix to rows 1-1 and columns 2-2 (1-indexed)**: The current matrix does not have a second column, so this operation results in an empty matrix:\n   ```\n   (empty)\n   ```\n\n9. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: An empty matrix remains empty after mirroring. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   (empty)\n   ```\n\n10. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: An empty matrix remains empty after mirroring. The matrix remains:\n    ```\n    (empty)\n    ```\n\nAfter performing all the operations, the final matrix is empty. Therefore, the output is:\n\n<<<>>>"
