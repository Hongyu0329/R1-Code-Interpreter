    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix step by step. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains the same.\n\n2. **Remove every 3rd row (1-indexed)**: \n   - The original matrix is:\n     ```\n     1 9 9 3 6 7 4 5 7 8\n     5 2 8 1 0 8 7 1 5 0\n     1 9 2 3 3 0 8 6 7 8\n     6 8 2 8 0 9 2 9 9 5\n     2 1 0 7 6 9 4 1 3 6\n     6 6 6 1 4 6 2 0 0 6\n     6 2 3 1 5 5 4 9 9 3\n     7 6 7 7 8 8 7 6 4 0\n     0 8 1 7 3 9 4 9 3 5\n     ```\n   - Remove rows 3, 6, and 9 (1-indexed):\n     ```\n     1 9 9 3 6 7 4 5 7 8\n     5 2 8 1 0 8 7 1 5 0\n     6 8 2 8 0 9 2 9 9 5\n     2 1 0 7 6 9 4 1 3 6\n     6 2 3 1 5 5 4 9 9 3\n     7 6 7 7 8 8 7 6 4 0\n     ```\n\n3. **Crop the matrix to rows 1-5 and columns 5-9 (1-indexed)**:\n   - The matrix becomes:\n     ```\n     6 7 4 5 7\n     0 8 7 1 5\n     0 9 2 9 9\n     6 9 4 1 3\n     5 5 4 9 9\n     ```\n\n4. **Crop the matrix to rows 3-3 and columns 3-3 (1-indexed)**:\n   - This results in a single element matrix:\n     ```\n     2\n     ```\n\n5. **Map each occurrence of 6 to 8**:\n   - Since the matrix is a single element `2`, this step does not change anything.\n\n6. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**:\n   - A single element matrix remains the same when mirrored along the diagonal:\n     ```\n     2\n     ```\n\n7. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**:\n   - Again, a single element matrix remains the same:\n     ```\n     2\n     ```\n\n8. **Crop the matrix to rows 1-1 and columns 1-1 (1-indexed)**:\n   - The matrix is already a single element, so it remains:\n     ```\n     2\n     ```\n\n9. **Vertically mirror the matrix**:\n   - A single element matrix remains the same when vertically mirrored:\n     ```\n     2\n     ```\n\nAfter performing all the operations, the final matrix is:\n\n<<<2>>>"
