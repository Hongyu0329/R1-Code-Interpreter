    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   The matrix provided is:\n   ```\n   2 4 3 7 0\n   0 1 5 8 5\n   0 8 7 5 9\n   ```\n\n2. **Identity Transformation:**\n   The first operation is an identity transformation, which means no changes are made to the matrix. Therefore, the matrix remains:\n   ```\n   2 4 3 7 0\n   0 1 5 8 5\n   0 8 7 5 9\n   ```\n\n3. **Map Each Occurrence of 2 to 8:**\n   The next operation is to replace every occurrence of the number 2 with the number 8. We will go through each element of the matrix and perform this replacement:\n   - First row: 2 is replaced with 8, resulting in `8 4 3 7 0`.\n   - Second row: No 2s are present, so it remains `0 1 5 8 5`.\n   - Third row: No 2s are present, so it remains `0 8 7 5 9`.\n\n   After performing the replacement, the matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   8 4 3 7 0\n   0 1 5 8 5\n   0 8 7 5 9\n   ```\n\n4. **Format the Final Matrix:**\n   Finally, we need to format the matrix to match the required output format, which is enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final matrix after performing all the operations is:\n```\n<<<8 4 3 7 0\n0 1 5 8 5\n0 8 7 5 9>>>\n```"
