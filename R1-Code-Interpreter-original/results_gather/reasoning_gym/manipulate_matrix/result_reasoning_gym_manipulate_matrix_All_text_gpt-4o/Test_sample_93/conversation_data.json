    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's go through each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: No change to the matrix.\n   ```\n   9 4 9 2 5\n   2 9 4 9 0\n   1 2 7 8 6\n   1 4 4 2 7\n   2 7 2 0 4\n   ```\n\n2. **Set all elements divisible by 7 to zero**:\n   ```\n   9 4 9 2 5\n   2 9 4 9 0\n   1 2 0 8 6\n   1 4 4 2 0\n   2 0 2 0 4\n   ```\n\n3. **Rotate the matrix 180 degrees**:\n   ```\n   4 0 2 0 2\n   0 2 4 4 1\n   6 8 0 2 1\n   0 9 4 9 2\n   5 2 9 4 9\n   ```\n\n4. **Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed)**:\n   ```\n   4 0 2 0 2\n   6 8 0 2 1\n   5 2 9 4 9\n   ```\n\n5. **Rotate the matrix 90 degrees**:\n   ```\n   5 6 4\n   2 8 0\n   9 0 2\n   4 2 0\n   9 1 2\n   ```\n\n6. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**:\n   ```\n   5 2 9 4 9\n   6 8 0 2 1\n   4 0 2 0 2\n   ```\n\n7. **Set all elements divisible by 1 to zero**: This operation sets all elements to zero because every integer is divisible by 1.\n   ```\n   0 0 0 0 0\n   0 0 0 0 0\n   0 0 0 0 0\n   ```\n\n8. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: The matrix remains unchanged as all elements are zero.\n   ```\n   0 0 0 0 0\n   0 0 0 0 0\n   0 0 0 0 0\n   ```\n\n9. **Set all elements divisible by 6 to zero**: The matrix remains unchanged as all elements are already zero.\n   ```\n   0 0 0 0 0\n   0 0 0 0 0\n   0 0 0 0 0\n   ```\n\n10. **Map each occurrence of 6 to 3**: The matrix remains unchanged as there are no 6s.\n    ```\n    0 0 0 0 0\n    0 0 0 0 0\n    0 0 0 0 0\n    ```\n\n11. **Remove every 5-th row (1-indexed)**: There are only three rows, so no row is removed.\n    ```\n    0 0 0 0 0\n    0 0 0 0 0\n    0 0 0 0 0\n    ```\n\nThe final matrix after performing all the operations is:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nTherefore, the final output is:\n<<<0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0>>>"
