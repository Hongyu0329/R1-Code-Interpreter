    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   4 4 6\n   0 2 6\n   3 7 6\n   8 0 3\n   2 5 6\n   ```\n\n2. **Remove every 3rd column (1-indexed)**: We remove the 3rd column from the matrix:\n   ```\n   4 4\n   0 2\n   3 7\n   8 0\n   2 5\n   ```\n\n3. **Crop the matrix to rows 2-3 and columns 2-2 (1-indexed)**: This means we take the submatrix from row 2 to row 3 and column 2 to column 2:\n   ```\n   2\n   7\n   ```\n\n4. **Rotate the matrix 90 degrees**: Rotating a single column matrix 90 degrees clockwise results in a single row matrix:\n   ```\n   7 2\n   ```\n\n5. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: This means reversing the order of elements in the row:\n   ```\n   2 7\n   ```\n\n6. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: For a 1x2 matrix, this operation doesn't change the matrix because there is no counterdiagonal to mirror across. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   2 7\n   ```\n\n7. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: Again, reverse the order of elements in the row:\n   ```\n   7 2\n   ```\n\nAfter performing all the operations, the final matrix is:\n```\n7 2\n```\n\nEnclosing the final matrix within triple angle brackets, the output is:\n<<<7 2>>>"
