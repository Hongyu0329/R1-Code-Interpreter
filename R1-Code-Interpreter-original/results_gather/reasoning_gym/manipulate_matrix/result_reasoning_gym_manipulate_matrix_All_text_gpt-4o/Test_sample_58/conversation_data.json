    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   The given matrix is:\n   ```\n   7 9 9\n   4 5 7\n   9 4 4\n   7 4 5\n   1 8 2\n   ```\n\n2. **Identity Transformation:**\n   The first operation is an identity transformation, which means no change is made to the matrix. Therefore, the matrix remains the same:\n   ```\n   7 9 9\n   4 5 7\n   9 4 4\n   7 4 5\n   1 8 2\n   ```\n\n3. **Remove Every 3rd Column (1-indexed):**\n   The next operation is to remove every 3rd column. In a 1-indexed system, the 3rd column refers to the last column of the matrix. We need to remove this column from the matrix.\n\n   - Original matrix:\n     ```\n     7 9 9\n     4 5 7\n     9 4 4\n     7 4 5\n     1 8 2\n     ```\n\n   - After removing the 3rd column:\n     ```\n     7 9\n     4 5\n     9 4\n     7 4\n     1 8\n     ```\n\n4. **Final Matrix:**\n   The final matrix, after performing all the operations, is:\n   ```\n   7 9\n   4 5\n   9 4\n   7 4\n   1 8\n   ```\n\n5. **Output Format:**\n   The final matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets, with each row on a new line and values separated by spaces.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<7 9\n4 5\n9 4\n7 4\n1 8>>>"
