    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's go through each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains the same:\n   ```\n   7 0 8 7 5 1 5 1\n   4 4 7 5 9 7 4 6\n   0 6 8 9 7 3 2 3\n   2 4 7 9 2 7 0 4\n   9 0 1 0 4 5 3 0\n   1 6 1 4 5 8 1 7\n   4 4 9 3 3 6 0 0\n   4 5 7 4 0 8 2 8\n   8 7 0 4 8 5 2 5\n   ```\n\n2. **Remove every 9-th row (1-indexed)**: The 9th row is `8 7 0 4 8 5 2 5`. Removing this row, the matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   7 0 8 7 5 1 5 1\n   4 4 7 5 9 7 4 6\n   0 6 8 9 7 3 2 3\n   2 4 7 9 2 7 0 4\n   9 0 1 0 4 5 3 0\n   1 6 1 4 5 8 1 7\n   4 4 9 3 3 6 0 0\n   4 5 7 4 0 8 2 8\n   ```\n\n3. **Crop the matrix to rows 2-5 and columns 5-7 (1-indexed)**: This means we take rows 2 to 5 and columns 5 to 7:\n   ```\n   9 7 4\n   7 3 2\n   2 7 0\n   4 5 3\n   ```\n\n4. **Remove every 3-th column (1-indexed)**: The 3rd column in this cropped matrix is `4, 2, 0, 3`. Removing this column, the matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   9 7\n   7 3\n   2 7\n   4 5\n   ```\n\n5. **Remove every 3-th row (1-indexed)**: The 3rd row in this matrix is `2 7`. Removing this row, the matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   9 7\n   7 3\n   4 5\n   ```\n\n6. **Rotate the matrix 360 degrees**: A 360-degree rotation results in the matrix remaining unchanged:\n   ```\n   9 7\n   7 3\n   4 5\n   ```\n\nThe final matrix after performing all the operations is:\n```\n9 7\n7 3\n4 5\n```\n\nEnclosing the final matrix within triple angle brackets, the output is:\n<<<9 7\n7 3\n4 5>>>"
