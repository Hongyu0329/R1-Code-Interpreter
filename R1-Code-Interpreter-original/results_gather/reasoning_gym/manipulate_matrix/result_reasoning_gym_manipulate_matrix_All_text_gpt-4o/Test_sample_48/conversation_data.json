    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's go through each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity Transformation**: This step means we do nothing to the matrix. The matrix remains the same:\n   ```\n   8 6 5 5 8 6 5 0\n   8 6 3 9 0 6 3 2\n   8 9 0 2 7 9 2 2\n   3 5 5 9 2 3 4 4\n   1 5 1 0 0 2 8 4\n   4 5 9 9 0 5 7 1\n   ```\n\n2. **Set all elements divisible by 9 to zero**: We replace all elements that are divisible by 9 with zero:\n   ```\n   8 6 5 5 8 6 5 0\n   8 6 3 0 0 6 3 2\n   8 0 0 2 7 0 2 2\n   3 5 5 0 2 3 4 4\n   1 5 1 0 0 2 8 4\n   4 5 0 0 0 5 7 1\n   ```\n\n3. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: This operation involves transposing the matrix, i.e., swapping rows with columns:\n   ```\n   8 8 8 3 1 4\n   6 6 0 5 5 5\n   5 3 0 5 1 0\n   5 0 2 0 0 0\n   8 0 7 2 0 0\n   6 6 0 3 2 5\n   5 3 2 4 8 7\n   0 2 2 4 4 1\n   ```\n\n4. **Crop the matrix to rows 8-8 and columns 3-5 (1-indexed)**: This means we only take the 8th row and columns 3 to 5. In 0-indexed terms, this corresponds to row 7 and columns 2 to 4:\n   ```\n   2 2 4\n   ```\n\n5. **Remove every 3rd column (1-indexed)**: In this step, we remove the 3rd column from the cropped matrix:\n   ```\n   2 2\n   ```\n\nThe final matrix after performing all the operations is:\n```\n2 2\n```\n\nEnclosing the final matrix within triple angle brackets, the output is:\n<<<2 2>>>"
