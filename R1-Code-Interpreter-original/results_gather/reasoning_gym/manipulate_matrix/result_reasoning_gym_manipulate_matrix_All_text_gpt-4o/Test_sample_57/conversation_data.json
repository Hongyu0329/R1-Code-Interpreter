    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix step by step. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   2 5 1 2 6 5\n   3 4 5 1 9 2\n   7 9 0 3 2 9\n   ```\n\n2. **Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed)**: This means removing the second row of the matrix. The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   2 5 1 2 6 5\n   7 9 0 3 2 9\n   ```\n\n3. **Map each occurrence of 1 to 9**: Replace all 1s with 9s. The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   2 5 9 2 6 5\n   7 9 0 3 2 9\n   ```\n\n4. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: The counterdiagonal runs from the bottom-left to the top-right. After mirroring, the matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   9 2\n   5 6\n   2 3\n   9 0\n   5 7\n   2 9\n   ```\n\n5. **Rotate the matrix 270 degrees**: Rotating 270 degrees clockwise is equivalent to rotating 90 degrees counterclockwise. The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   2 5 9 2 5 9\n   9 7 0 3 6 2\n   ```\n\n6. **Crop the matrix to rows 1-1 and columns 1-2 (1-indexed)**: This means taking only the first row and the first two columns. The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   2 5\n   ```\n\n7. **Map each occurrence of 1 to 2**: There are no 1s in the matrix, so it remains unchanged:\n   ```\n   2 5\n   ```\n\n8. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: The diagonal runs from the top-left to the bottom-right. After mirroring, the matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   2\n   5\n   ```\n\n9. **Crop the matrix to rows 2-2 and columns 1-1 (1-indexed)**: This means taking only the second row and the first column. The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   5\n   ```\n\nThe final matrix after performing all the operations is:\n```\n5\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<5>>>"
