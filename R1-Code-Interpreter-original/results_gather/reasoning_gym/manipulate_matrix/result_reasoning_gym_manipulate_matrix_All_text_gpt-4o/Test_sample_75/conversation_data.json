    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains as it is:\n   ```\n   7 4 2 6 8 1 4 4\n   9 0 4 5 3 2 9 3\n   2 8 2 3 5 1 1 2\n   1 7 3 2 7 4 1 3\n   4 6 6 3 1 9 4 6\n   ```\n\n2. **Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed)**: This means we remove the 2nd and 4th rows:\n   ```\n   7 4 2 6 8 1 4 4\n   2 8 2 3 5 1 1 2\n   4 6 6 3 1 9 4 6\n   ```\n\n3. **Remove every 3-th row (1-indexed)**: Now, we remove the 3rd row from the remaining matrix:\n   ```\n   7 4 2 6 8 1 4 4\n   2 8 2 3 5 1 1 2\n   ```\n\n4. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: This operation reverses the order of columns in each row:\n   ```\n   4 4 1 8 6 2 4 7\n   2 1 1 5 3 2 8 2\n   ```\n\n5. **Vertically mirror the matrix**: This operation reverses the order of rows:\n   ```\n   2 1 1 5 3 2 8 2\n   4 4 1 8 6 2 4 7\n   ```\n\n6. **Rotate the matrix 360 degrees**: A 360-degree rotation brings the matrix back to its original orientation:\n   ```\n   2 1 1 5 3 2 8 2\n   4 4 1 8 6 2 4 7\n   ```\n\nThe final matrix after performing all the operations is:\n```\n2 1 1 5 3 2 8 2\n4 4 1 8 6 2 4 7\n```\n\nEnclosing the final matrix within triple angle brackets, the output is:\n<<<2 1 1 5 3 2 8 2\n4 4 1 8 6 2 4 7>>>"
