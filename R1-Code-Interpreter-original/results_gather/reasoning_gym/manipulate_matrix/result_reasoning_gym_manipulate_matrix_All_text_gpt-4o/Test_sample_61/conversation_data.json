    "To solve the problem, we need to perform the specified operations on the given matrix step by step. Let's break down the operations:\n\n1. **Identity Transformation**: This operation means no change to the matrix. So, the matrix remains the same after this step.\n\n2. **Mirror the Matrix along the Counterdiagonal**: The counterdiagonal of a matrix is the diagonal that runs from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner. Mirroring along the counterdiagonal involves swapping elements symmetrically across this diagonal.\n\nLet's perform the mirroring operation:\n\nGiven matrix:\n```\n1 1 5 2 2 6 1\n2 9 0 9 8 1 9\n5 6 1 1 3 3 7\n2 9 4 9 4 5 3\n7 1 1 0 2 9 1\n1 1 4 0 3 9 3\n9 6 2 5 7 1 7\n6 2 8 2 8 1 4\n5 9 1 8 0 4 8\n```\n\nTo mirror along the counterdiagonal, we swap elements (i, j) with (n-j-1, n-i-1), where n is the number of rows (or columns, since it's a square matrix). The matrix is 9x7, so we need to consider the dimensions carefully. However, since the matrix is not square, we need to adjust our approach to handle the non-square nature.\n\nThe counterdiagonal mirroring for a non-square matrix involves reflecting elements across the line that runs from the bottom-left to the top-right, which is a bit more complex. For simplicity, let's consider the transformation for each element:\n\n- The element at position (0, 0) will swap with the element at position (6, 8).\n- The element at position (0, 1) will swap with the element at position (5, 8).\n- Continue this pattern for all elements.\n\nAfter performing the mirroring operation, the final matrix is:\n\n```\n8 4 1 9 5 2 6\n4 1 8 0 8 2 9\n7 1 7 3 1 9 1\n3 5 4 4 9 4 2\n7 3 3 1 1 6 5\n9 1 8 9 0 9 2\n1 6 2 2 5 1 1\n9 1 8 9 0 9 2\n5 9 1 8 0 4 8\n```\n\nNow, let's format the final matrix as required:\n\n<<<8 4 1 9 5 2 6\n4 1 8 0 8 2 9\n7 1 7 3 1 9 1\n3 5 4 4 9 4 2\n7 3 3 1 1 6 5\n9 1 8 9 0 9 2\n1 6 2 2 5 1 1\n9 1 8 9 0 9 2\n5 9 1 8 0 4 8>>>"
