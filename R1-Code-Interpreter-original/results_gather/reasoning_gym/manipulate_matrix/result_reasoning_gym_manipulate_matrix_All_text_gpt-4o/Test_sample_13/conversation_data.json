    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's go through each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains as it is:\n   ```\n   7 4 1 4 5 0 1 7\n   0 1 4 1 4 0 9 1\n   2 4 2 3 6 1 9 6\n   2 0 0 2 5 4 5 5\n   1 6 1 0 5 5 6 8\n   8 9 4 9 0 7 5 3\n   ```\n\n2. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: Reverse each row of the matrix.\n   ```\n   7 1 0 5 4 1 4 7\n   1 9 0 4 1 4 1 0\n   6 9 1 6 3 2 4 2\n   5 5 4 5 2 0 0 2\n   8 6 5 5 0 1 6 1\n   3 5 7 0 9 4 9 8\n   ```\n\n3. **Crop the matrix to rows 2-5 and columns 7-8 (1-indexed)**: This means we take rows 1 to 4 (0-indexed) and columns 6 to 7 (0-indexed).\n   ```\n   4 7\n   1 0\n   4 2\n   0 2\n   ```\n\n4. **Vertically mirror the matrix**: Reverse the order of the rows.\n   ```\n   0 2\n   4 2\n   1 0\n   4 7\n   ```\n\n5. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: Transpose the matrix (swap rows with columns).\n   ```\n   0 4 1 4\n   2 2 0 7\n   ```\n\n6. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: Transpose the matrix again.\n   ```\n   0 2\n   4 2\n   1 0\n   4 7\n   ```\n\n7. **Map each occurrence of 8 to 1**: There are no 8s in the current matrix, so no changes are made.\n\nThe final matrix after all operations is:\n```\n0 2\n4 2\n1 0\n4 7\n```\n\nEnclosing the final matrix within triple angle brackets, the output is:\n<<<0 2\n4 2\n1 0\n4 7>>>"
