    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's go through each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This step means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains the same.\n\n2. **Set all elements divisible by 1 to zero**: Since every integer is divisible by 1, this operation will set every element in the matrix to zero. The matrix will now be entirely filled with zeros.\n\n3. **Remove every 2-nd column (1-indexed)**: The matrix is currently filled with zeros. Removing every 2-nd column (1-indexed) means we remove columns 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. This will leave us with columns 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. The matrix will still be filled with zeros, but now it will have 5 columns instead of 10.\n\n4. **Set all elements divisible by 8 to zero**: Since the matrix is already filled with zeros, this operation will not change anything. All elements remain zero.\n\n5. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: This operation involves reversing the order of columns. However, since all elements are zero, the matrix will look the same after mirroring.\n\nAfter performing all these operations, the final matrix will be:\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nEnclosing the final matrix within triple angle brackets, the output is:\n\n<<<0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0>>>"
