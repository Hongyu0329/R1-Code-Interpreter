    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's go through each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   5 2 0 8 0\n   5 7 2 3 1\n   2 9 2 7 6\n   5 6 2 4 2\n   1 7 5 0 2\n   3 7 3 3 2\n   0 3 8 7 8\n   0 7 6 8 6\n   ```\n\n2. **Map each occurrence of 7 to 2**: Replace all 7s with 2s:\n   ```\n   5 2 0 8 0\n   5 2 2 3 1\n   2 9 2 2 6\n   5 6 2 4 2\n   1 2 5 0 2\n   3 2 3 3 2\n   0 3 8 2 8\n   0 2 6 8 6\n   ```\n\n3. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: Transpose the matrix (swap rows with columns):\n   ```\n   5 5 2 5 1 3 0 0\n   2 2 9 6 2 2 3 2\n   0 2 2 2 5 3 8 6\n   8 3 2 4 0 3 2 8\n   0 1 6 2 2 2 8 6\n   ```\n\n4. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: Reverse each row:\n   ```\n   0 0 3 1 5 5 2 5\n   2 3 2 2 6 9 2 2\n   6 8 3 5 2 2 2 0\n   8 2 3 0 4 2 3 8\n   6 8 2 2 2 6 1 0\n   ```\n\n5. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: Swap elements across the counterdiagonal (bottom-left to top-right):\n   ```\n   6 8 2 2 2 6 1 0\n   8 2 3 0 4 2 3 8\n   6 8 3 5 2 2 2 0\n   2 3 2 2 6 9 2 2\n   0 0 3 1 5 5 2 5\n   ```\n\n6. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: Transpose the matrix again:\n   ```\n   6 8 6 2 0\n   8 2 8 3 0\n   2 3 3 2 3\n   2 0 5 2 1\n   2 4 2 6 5\n   6 2 2 9 5\n   1 3 2 2 2\n   0 8 0 8 5\n   ```\n\n7. **Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed)**: Remove rows 2, 4, 6, 8:\n   ```\n   6 8 6 2 0\n   2 3 3 2 3\n   2 4 2 6 5\n   1 3 2 2 2\n   ```\n\n8. **Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed)**: Remove rows 2, 4:\n   ```\n   6 8 6 2 0\n   2 4 2 6 5\n   ```\n\n9. **Map each occurrence of 1 to 6**: Replace all 1s with 6s (no 1s in the remaining matrix):\n   ```\n   6 8 6 2 0\n   2 4 2 6 5\n   ```\n\nThe final matrix after all operations is:\n```\n6 8 6 2 0\n2 4 2 6 5\n```\n\nEnclosed within triple angle brackets, the final output is:\n<<<6 8 6 2 0\n2 4 2 6 5>>>"
