    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   5 6\n   0 7\n   4 8\n   1 7\n   3 6\n   0 5\n   0 0\n   ```\n\n2. **Crop the matrix to rows 3-3 and columns 2-2 (1-indexed)**: This means we only take the element at the intersection of row 3 and column 2. The element is `8`. The matrix now is:\n   ```\n   8\n   ```\n\n3. **Map each occurrence of 6 to 2**: There is no `6` in the current matrix, so no change is made. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   8\n   ```\n\n4. **Map each occurrence of 3 to 4**: There is no `3` in the current matrix, so no change is made. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   8\n   ```\n\n5. **Set all elements divisible by 3 to zero**: `8` is not divisible by 3, so no change is made. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   8\n   ```\n\n6. **Vertically mirror the matrix**: Since the matrix is a single element, vertical mirroring does not change it. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   8\n   ```\n\n7. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: Similarly, horizontal mirroring does not change a single element matrix. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   8\n   ```\n\n8. **Crop the matrix to rows 1-1 and columns 1-1 (1-indexed)**: This operation keeps the matrix unchanged as it is already a single element. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   8\n   ```\n\nAfter performing all the operations, the final matrix is:\n```\n8\n```\n\nThe final output, formatted as specified, is:\n```\n<<<8>>>\n```"
