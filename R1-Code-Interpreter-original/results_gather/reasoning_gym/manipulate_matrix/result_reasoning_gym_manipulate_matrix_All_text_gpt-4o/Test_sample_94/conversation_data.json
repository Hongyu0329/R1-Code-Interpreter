    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   3 2 7 7 3 2 2 7 1\n   4 8 2 5 3 7 6 0 6\n   ```\n\n2. **Crop the matrix to rows 2-2 and columns 9-9 (1-indexed)**: This operation extracts a submatrix from the original matrix. Since we are cropping to a single row and column, the result is:\n   ```\n   6\n   ```\n\n3. **Crop the matrix to rows 1-1 and columns 1-1 (1-indexed)**: This operation extracts the element at the first row and first column of the original matrix. The result is:\n   ```\n   3\n   ```\n\n4. **Set all elements divisible by 7 to zero**: Since the current matrix is just a single element `3`, and `3` is not divisible by `7`, the matrix remains:\n   ```\n   3\n   ```\n\n5. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: For a single element matrix, mirroring along the diagonal has no effect. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   3\n   ```\n\n6. **Rotate the matrix 360 degrees**: Rotating a single element matrix by any degree results in no change. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   3\n   ```\n\n7. **Vertically mirror the matrix**: For a single element matrix, vertical mirroring has no effect. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   3\n   ```\n\n8. **Map each occurrence of 2 to 3**: Since the matrix contains only the element `3`, and there are no `2`s to map to `3`, the matrix remains:\n   ```\n   3\n   ```\n\nAfter performing all the operations, the final matrix is:\n```\n3\n```\n\nEnclosing the final matrix within triple angle brackets, the output is:\n\n<<<3>>>"
