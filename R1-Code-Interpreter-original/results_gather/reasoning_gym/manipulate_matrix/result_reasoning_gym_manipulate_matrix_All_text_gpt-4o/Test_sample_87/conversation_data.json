    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix step by step. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   8 8 6 1\n   1 6 3 2\n   4 4 3 7\n   9 0 6 4\n   6 0 5 3\n   2 7 0 8\n   ```\n\n2. **Crop the matrix to rows 4-4 and columns 1-2 (1-indexed)**: This means we take only the 4th row and the first two columns:\n   ```\n   9 0\n   ```\n\n3. **Vertically mirror the matrix**: Since the matrix is a single row, vertically mirroring it does not change it:\n   ```\n   9 0\n   ```\n\n4. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: For a 2x2 matrix, mirroring along the counterdiagonal swaps the elements:\n   ```\n   0 9\n   ```\n\n5. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: Repeating the same operation will revert it back to the original:\n   ```\n   9 0\n   ```\n\n6. **Remove every 2-nd column (1-indexed)**: This means removing the second column:\n   ```\n   9\n   ```\n\n7. **Crop the matrix to rows 1-1 and columns 1-1 (1-indexed)**: This means taking the first row and first column, which is the single element:\n   ```\n   9\n   ```\n\n8. **Set all elements divisible by 6 to zero**: The number 9 is not divisible by 6, so it remains unchanged:\n   ```\n   9\n   ```\n\n9. **Crop the matrix to rows 1-1 and columns 1-1 (1-indexed)**: The matrix is already a single element, so it remains:\n   ```\n   9\n   ```\n\n10. **Map each occurrence of 3 to 9**: There is no 3 in the matrix, so no change is needed:\n    ```\n    9\n    ```\n\nThe final matrix after all operations is a single element matrix containing the number 9. Therefore, the final output is:\n\n<<<9>>>"
