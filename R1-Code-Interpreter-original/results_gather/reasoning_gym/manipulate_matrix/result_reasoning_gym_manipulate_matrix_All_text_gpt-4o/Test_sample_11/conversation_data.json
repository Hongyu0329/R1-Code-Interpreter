    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   2 7 5 1 7 9\n   7 9 0 8 6 9\n   ```\n\n2. **Set all elements divisible by 9 to zero**: We replace elements that are divisible by 9 with zero. In this matrix, the elements 9 and 9 are divisible by 9.\n   ```\n   2 7 5 1 7 0\n   7 0 0 8 6 0\n   ```\n\n3. **Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed)**: We remove the second row (1-indexed), which is the row `7 0 0 8 6 0`.\n   ```\n   2 7 5 1 7 0\n   ```\n\n4. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: Since the matrix is now a single row, mirroring along the diagonal doesn't change it. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   2 7 5 1 7 0\n   ```\n\n5. **Rotate the matrix 90 degrees**: Rotating a single row 90 degrees results in a column:\n   ```\n   2\n   7\n   5\n   1\n   7\n   0\n   ```\n\n6. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: Now, we mirror this column along the diagonal, which turns it back into a row:\n   ```\n   2 7 5 1 7 0\n   ```\n\n7. **Rotate the matrix 360 degrees**: Rotating a matrix 360 degrees results in no change. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   2 7 5 1 7 0\n   ```\n\nThe final matrix, after performing all the operations, is:\n```\n2 7 5 1 7 0\n```\n\nEnclosing the final matrix within triple angle brackets, the output is:\n<<<2 7 5 1 7 0>>>"
