    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's go through each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity Transformation**: This means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   7 0\n   8 5\n   3 7\n   7 8\n   5 9\n   2 8\n   ```\n\n2. **Map each occurrence of 6 to 5**: There are no 6s in the matrix, so no changes are made.\n\n3. **Set all elements divisible by 3 to zero**: We need to identify elements divisible by 3 and set them to zero. The elements divisible by 3 are 3 and 9.\n   ```\n   7 0\n   8 5\n   0 7\n   7 8\n   5 0\n   2 8\n   ```\n\n4. **Set all elements divisible by 8 to zero**: We need to identify elements divisible by 8 and set them to zero. The elements divisible by 8 are 8 and 8.\n   ```\n   7 0\n   0 5\n   0 7\n   7 0\n   5 0\n   2 0\n   ```\n\n5. **Rotate the matrix 90 degrees**: Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves turning rows into columns. The first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n   ```\n   2 5 7 0 7 0\n   0 0 0 7 0 5\n   ```\n\n6. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: This involves flipping the matrix horizontally, which means reversing the order of columns.\n   ```\n   0 7 0 0 5 2\n   5 0 7 0 0 0\n   ```\n\nThe final matrix after performing all the operations is:\n```\n0 7 0 0 5 2\n5 0 7 0 0 0\n```\n\nEnclosing the final matrix within triple angle brackets, we get:\n\n<<<0 7 0 0 5 2\n5 0 7 0 0 0>>>"
