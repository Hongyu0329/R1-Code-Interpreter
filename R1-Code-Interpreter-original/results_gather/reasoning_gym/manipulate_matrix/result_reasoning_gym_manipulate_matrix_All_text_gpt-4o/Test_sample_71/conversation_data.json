    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identity Transformation**: This operation means no change to the matrix. So, the matrix remains the same after this step.\n\n2. **Mirror the Matrix along the Counterdiagonal**: The counterdiagonal of a matrix is the diagonal that runs from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner. Mirroring along the counterdiagonal involves swapping elements symmetrically across this diagonal.\n\n   Let's denote the given matrix as follows for clarity:\n   ```\n   A = [\n       [1, 9, 1, 6, 7],\n       [5, 1, 7, 1, 2],\n       [3, 9, 0, 0, 3],\n       [1, 2, 9, 8, 4],\n       [2, 6, 9, 6, 3],\n       [9, 9, 3, 1, 5],\n       [3, 9, 3, 9, 8],\n       [7, 4, 4, 3, 8],\n       [7, 8, 3, 8, 4]\n   ]\n   ```\n\n   To mirror along the counterdiagonal, we swap elements such that element at position (i, j) is swapped with the element at position (n-j-1, n-i-1), where n is the number of rows in the matrix.\n\n   Applying this transformation to the matrix, we get the following steps:\n\n   - Swap (0,0) with (8,4)\n   - Swap (0,1) with (7,4)\n   - Swap (0,2) with (6,4)\n   - Swap (0,3) with (5,4)\n   - Swap (0,4) with (4,4)\n   - Swap (1,0) with (8,3)\n   - Swap (1,1) with (7,3)\n   - Swap (1,2) with (6,3)\n   - Swap (1,3) with (5,3)\n   - Swap (1,4) with (4,3)\n   - Swap (2,0) with (8,2)\n   - Swap (2,1) with (7,2)\n   - Swap (2,2) with (6,2)\n   - Swap (2,3) with (5,2)\n   - Swap (2,4) with (4,2)\n   - Swap (3,0) with (8,1)\n   - Swap (3,1) with (7,1)\n   - Swap (3,2) with (6,1)\n   - Swap (3,3) with (5,1)\n   - Swap (3,4) with (4,1)\n   - Swap (4,0) with (8,0)\n   - Swap (4,1) with (7,0)\n   - Swap (4,2) with (6,0)\n   - Swap (4,3) with (5,0)\n   - Swap (4,4) with (4,0)\n\n   After performing all these swaps, the final matrix is:\n\n   ```\n   [\n       [4, 8, 8, 5, 3],\n       [8, 3, 9, 9, 2],\n       [3, 4, 3, 3, 0],\n       [4, 9, 3, 1, 1],\n       [7, 7, 3, 9, 1],\n       [8, 4, 3, 9, 6],\n       [9, 9, 0, 7, 1],\n       [4, 2, 9, 1, 9],\n       [7, 3, 6, 1, 1]\n   ]\n   ```\n\nFinally, we format the output as specified:\n\n<<<4 8 8 5 3\n8 3 9 9 2\n3 4 3 3 0\n4 9 3 1 1\n7 7 3 9 1\n8 4 3 9 6\n9 9 0 7 1\n4 2 9 1 9\n7 3 6 1 1>>>"
