    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity Transformation**: This operation means no change to the matrix. So, the matrix remains the same:\n   ```\n   8 1 4 5 8\n   5 1 5 0 4\n   6 1 7 8 9\n   1 3 4 2 8\n   ```\n\n2. **Mirror the Matrix Along the Diagonal**: This operation involves transposing the matrix, which means swapping rows with columns. The diagonal elements remain the same, and the elements are mirrored across the diagonal. The transposed matrix is:\n   ```\n   8 5 6 1\n   1 1 1 3\n   4 5 7 4\n   5 0 8 2\n   8 4 9 8\n   ```\n\n3. **Set All Elements Divisible by 7 to Zero**: We need to identify elements in the matrix that are divisible by 7 and set them to zero. In the transposed matrix, the element '7' is the only number divisible by 7. So, we set it to zero:\n   ```\n   8 5 6 1\n   1 1 1 3\n   4 5 0 4\n   5 0 8 2\n   8 4 9 8\n   ```\n\nAfter performing all the operations, the final matrix is:\n```\n8 5 6 1\n1 1 1 3\n4 5 0 4\n5 0 8 2\n8 4 9 8\n```\n\nEnclosing the final matrix within triple angle brackets, the output is:\n\n<<<8 5 6 1\n1 1 1 3\n4 5 0 4\n5 0 8 2\n8 4 9 8>>>"
