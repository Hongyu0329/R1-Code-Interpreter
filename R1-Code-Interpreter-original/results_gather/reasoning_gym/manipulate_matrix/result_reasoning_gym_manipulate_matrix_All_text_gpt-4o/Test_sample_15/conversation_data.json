    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   6 8 7\n   9 5 4\n   8 6 6\n   9 0 6\n   0 1 0\n   4 7 8\n   0 5 9\n   ```\n\n2. **Vertically mirror the matrix**: This operation flips the matrix upside down. The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   0 5 9\n   4 7 8\n   0 1 0\n   9 0 6\n   8 6 6\n   9 5 4\n   6 8 7\n   ```\n\n3. **Map each occurrence of 5 to 7**: Replace all 5s with 7s. The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   0 7 9\n   4 7 8\n   0 1 0\n   9 0 6\n   8 6 6\n   9 7 4\n   6 8 7\n   ```\n\n4. **Remove every 2-nd column (1-indexed)**: Remove the second column. The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   0 9\n   4 8\n   0 0\n   9 6\n   8 6\n   9 4\n   6 7\n   ```\n\n5. **Map each occurrence of 5 to 9**: There are no 5s in the matrix, so no change occurs.\n\n6. **Map each occurrence of 3 to 9**: There are no 3s in the matrix, so no change occurs.\n\n7. **Crop the matrix to rows 6-6 and columns 1-2 (1-indexed)**: This means we only take the 6th row and both columns. The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   9 4\n   ```\n\n8. **Rotate the matrix 360 degrees**: A 360-degree rotation results in no change. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   9 4\n   ```\n\nFinally, we format the output as specified, enclosed within triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<9 4>>>"
