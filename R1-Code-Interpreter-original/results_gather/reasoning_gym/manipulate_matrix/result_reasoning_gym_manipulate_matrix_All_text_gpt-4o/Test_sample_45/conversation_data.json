    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix step by step. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains the same:\n   ```\n   3 3 3 1 4 7 8\n   9 3 2 8 8 0 4\n   0 7 2 3 8 6 2\n   5 5 1 1 8 4 8\n   7 3 3 3 1 1 3\n   8 7 9 8 1 1 3\n   ```\n\n2. **Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed)**: We remove rows 2, 4, and 6.\n   ```\n   3 3 3 1 4 7 8\n   0 7 2 3 8 6 2\n   7 3 3 3 1 1 3\n   ```\n\n3. **Map each occurrence of 1 to 8**: Replace all 1s with 8s.\n   ```\n   3 3 3 8 4 7 8\n   0 7 2 3 8 6 2\n   7 3 3 3 8 8 3\n   ```\n\n4. **Remove every 4-th column (1-indexed)**: We remove column 4.\n   ```\n   3 3 3 4 7 8\n   0 7 2 8 6 2\n   7 3 3 8 8 3\n   ```\n\n5. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: The counterdiagonal runs from the bottom-left to the top-right. We need to reflect the matrix along this line. The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   3 6 8\n   2 8 7\n   8 4 3\n   3 7 3\n   3 0 7\n   ```\n\n6. **Crop the matrix to rows 5-5 and columns 2-2 (1-indexed)**: This means we only take the element at row 5, column 2.\n   ```\n   0\n   ```\n\n7. **Crop the matrix to rows 1-1 and columns 1-1 (1-indexed)**: This means we only take the element at row 1, column 1, which is the same as the previous step.\n   ```\n   0\n   ```\n\nThe final matrix after all operations is a single element matrix:\n```\n0\n```\n\nEnclosing the final matrix within triple angle brackets, the output is:\n\n<<<0>>>"
