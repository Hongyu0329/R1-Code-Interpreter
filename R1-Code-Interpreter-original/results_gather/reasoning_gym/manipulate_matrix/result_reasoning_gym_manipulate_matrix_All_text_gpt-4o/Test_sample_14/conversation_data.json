    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of matrix operations step by step on the given matrix:\n\nInitial matrix:\n```\n0 9 9 3 8 2 9 8\n0 0 1 5 0 0 2 8\n4 8 5 1 6 7 5 2\n```\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: No change to the matrix.\n   ```\n   0 9 9 3 8 2 9 8\n   0 0 1 5 0 0 2 8\n   4 8 5 1 6 7 5 2\n   ```\n\n2. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: Swap elements symmetrically along the counterdiagonal (from top-right to bottom-left).\n   ```\n   2 5 7 6 1 5 0 4\n   8 2 0 0 5 1 0 0\n   8 9 2 8 3 9 9 0\n   ```\n\n3. **Rotate the matrix 90 degrees**: Rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise.\n   ```\n   4 0 0\n   5 0 9\n   7 1 2\n   6 0 8\n   1 5 3\n   5 1 9\n   0 0 9\n   2 8 0\n   ```\n\n4. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: Swap elements symmetrically along the counterdiagonal.\n   ```\n   0 9 9 0 9 1 5 4\n   8 0 0 1 5 0 0 0\n   2 8 0 9 3 5 1 0\n   ```\n\n5. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: Swap elements symmetrically along the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right).\n   ```\n   0 8 2\n   9 0 8\n   9 0 0\n   0 1 9\n   9 5 3\n   1 0 5\n   5 0 1\n   4 0 0\n   ```\n\n6. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: Swap elements symmetrically along the counterdiagonal.\n   ```\n   0 0 4\n   1 0 5\n   5 0 1\n   3 5 9\n   9 1 0\n   9 0 0\n   8 0 9\n   2 8 0\n   ```\n\n7. **Crop the matrix to rows 3-3 and columns 3-3 (1-indexed)**: Extract the element at row 3, column 3.\n   ```\n   4\n   ```\n\n8. **Set all elements divisible by 8 to zero**: Check if the element is divisible by 8.\n   - 4 is not divisible by 8, so no change.\n\n9. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: Since the matrix is a single element, mirroring has no effect.\n   ```\n   4\n   ```\n\nThe final matrix after performing all the operations is:\n```\n4\n```\n\nEnclosed within triple angle brackets, the final output is:\n<<<4>>>"
