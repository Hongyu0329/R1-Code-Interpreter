    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's break down each step:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   5 9 2 3 3 7 2 1 5\n   0 3 1 7 4 2 6 7 5\n   9 1 6 1 4 7 0 5 7\n   1 0 7 1 1 3 2 6 4\n   ```\n\n2. **Vertically mirror the matrix**: This operation flips the matrix upside down. The new matrix is:\n   ```\n   1 0 7 1 1 3 2 6 4\n   9 1 6 1 4 7 0 5 7\n   0 3 1 7 4 2 6 7 5\n   5 9 2 3 3 7 2 1 5\n   ```\n\n3. **Set all elements divisible by 8 to zero**: We replace elements divisible by 8 with zero. In this matrix, the number 0 is already zero, and the number 8 does not appear. Therefore, the matrix remains unchanged:\n   ```\n   1 0 7 1 1 3 2 6 4\n   9 1 6 1 4 7 0 5 7\n   0 3 1 7 4 2 6 7 5\n   5 9 2 3 3 7 2 1 5\n   ```\n\n4. **Vertically mirror the matrix**: Flip the matrix upside down again. The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   5 9 2 3 3 7 2 1 5\n   0 3 1 7 4 2 6 7 5\n   9 1 6 1 4 7 0 5 7\n   1 0 7 1 1 3 2 6 4\n   ```\n\n5. **Rotate the matrix 270 degrees**: Rotating 270 degrees clockwise is equivalent to rotating 90 degrees counterclockwise. The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   5 7 5 4\n   1 5 7 6\n   2 0 6 2\n   7 1 1 3\n   3 4 4 1\n   3 7 1 1\n   2 0 6 7\n   9 1 1 0\n   5 9 0 1\n   ```\n\n6. **Remove every 2-nd column (1-indexed)**: Remove columns 2, 4, 6, etc. The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   5 5 4\n   1 7 6\n   2 6 2\n   7 1 3\n   3 4 1\n   3 1 1\n   2 6 7\n   9 1 0\n   5 0 1\n   ```\n\n7. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: This operation transposes the matrix, swapping rows with columns. The final matrix is:\n   ```\n   5 1 2 7 3 3 2 9 5\n   5 7 6 1 4 1 6 1 0\n   4 6 2 3 1 1 7 0 1\n   ```\n\nThe final matrix, formatted as requested, is:\n<<<5 1 2 7 3 3 2 9 5\n5 7 6 1 4 1 6 1 0\n4 6 2 3 1 1 7 0 1>>>"
