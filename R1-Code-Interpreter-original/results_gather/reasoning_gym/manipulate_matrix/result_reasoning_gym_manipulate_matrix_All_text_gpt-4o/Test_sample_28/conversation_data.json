    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix step by step. Let's analyze each operation carefully:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: No change to the matrix.\n\n2. **Vertically mirror the matrix**: Reverse the order of the rows.\n   ```\n   2 0 9 3 4 3\n   9 0 9 9 1 4\n   4 9 2 8 9 8\n   0 3 0 6 2 2\n   5 0 1 2 2 6\n   9 2 4 3 7 7\n   ```\n\n3. **Remove every 3rd column (1-indexed)**: Remove columns 3 and 6.\n   ```\n   2 0 3 4\n   9 0 9 1\n   4 9 8 9\n   0 3 6 2\n   5 0 2 2\n   9 2 3 7\n   ```\n\n4. **Crop the matrix to rows 3-4 and columns 2-4 (1-indexed)**: Select rows 3 and 4, and columns 2 to 4.\n   ```\n   9 8 9\n   3 6 2\n   ```\n\n5. **Set all elements divisible by 2 to zero**: Replace elements divisible by 2 with zero.\n   ```\n   9 0 9\n   3 0 0\n   ```\n\n6. **Map each occurrence of 7 to 5**: There are no 7s in the current matrix, so no change.\n\n7. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: Transpose the matrix.\n   ```\n   9 3\n   0 0\n   9 0\n   ```\n\n8. **Remove every 2nd row (1-indexed)**: Remove row 2.\n   ```\n   9 3\n   9 0\n   ```\n\n9. **Rotate the matrix 90 degrees**: Rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise.\n   ```\n   9 9\n   0 3\n   ```\n\n10. **Rotate the matrix 360 degrees**: A 360-degree rotation results in no change.\n    ```\n    9 9\n    0 3\n    ```\n\nThe final matrix after performing all the operations is:\n```\n9 9\n0 3\n```\n\nEnclosing the final matrix within triple angle brackets, the output is:\n<<<9 9\n0 3>>>"
