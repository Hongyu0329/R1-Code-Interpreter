    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's go through each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   0 4 8\n   9 5 4\n   2 5 2\n   2 1 6\n   5 2 6\n   9 6 7\n   7 3 2\n   ```\n\n2. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: This operation transposes the matrix. The transposed matrix is:\n   ```\n   0 9 2 2 5 9 7\n   4 5 5 1 2 6 3\n   8 4 2 6 6 7 2\n   ```\n\n3. **Remove every 6-th column (1-indexed)**: The 6th column is removed:\n   ```\n   0 9 2 2 5 7\n   4 5 5 1 2 3\n   8 4 2 6 6 2\n   ```\n\n4. **Remove every 2-nd column (1-indexed)**: Remove columns 2, 4, and 6:\n   ```\n   0 2 5\n   4 5 2\n   8 2 6\n   ```\n\n5. **Remove every 2-nd column (1-indexed)**: Remove column 2:\n   ```\n   0 5\n   4 2\n   8 6\n   ```\n\n6. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: Transpose the matrix again:\n   ```\n   0 4 8\n   5 2 6\n   ```\n\n7. **Crop the matrix to rows 1-2 and columns 3-3 (1-indexed)**: This results in:\n   ```\n   8\n   6\n   ```\n\n8. **Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed)**: Remove row 2:\n   ```\n   8\n   ```\n\n9. **Map each occurrence of 8 to 1**: Replace 8 with 1:\n   ```\n   1\n   ```\n\n10. **Map each occurrence of 5 to 4**: No 5 is present, so no change:\n    ```\n    1\n    ```\n\n11. **Crop the matrix to rows 1-1 and columns 1-1 (1-indexed)**: The matrix remains:\n    ```\n    1\n    ```\n\nThe final matrix after all operations is:\n```\n1\n```\n\nEnclosing the final matrix within triple angle brackets, the output is:\n\n<<<1>>>"
