    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of matrix transformations step by step. Let's analyze each operation carefully:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: No change to the matrix.\n   ```\n   5 3 3\n   7 5 9\n   3 6 8\n   8 3 9\n   9 9 7\n   ```\n\n2. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: Swap elements symmetrically across the counterdiagonal (from top-right to bottom-left).\n   ```\n   7 9 7\n   9 5 3\n   8 6 3\n   9 5 3\n   5 3 8\n   ```\n\n3. **Rotate the matrix 90 degrees**: Rotate the matrix clockwise by 90 degrees.\n   ```\n   5 9 8 9 7\n   3 5 6 5 9\n   8 3 3 3 7\n   ```\n\n4. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: Swap elements symmetrically across the counterdiagonal.\n   ```\n   7 9 7\n   9 5 3\n   8 6 3\n   9 5 3\n   5 3 8\n   ```\n\n5. **Set all elements divisible by 8 to zero**: Replace elements divisible by 8 with zero.\n   ```\n   7 9 7\n   9 5 3\n   0 6 3\n   9 5 3\n   5 3 0\n   ```\n\n6. **Crop the matrix to rows 2-2 and columns 2-3 (1-indexed)**: Extract the submatrix from row 2 to row 2 and column 2 to column 3.\n   ```\n   5 3\n   ```\n\n7. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: For a 1x2 matrix, this operation has no effect.\n   ```\n   5 3\n   ```\n\n8. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: Swap elements symmetrically across the main diagonal. For a 1x2 matrix, this operation has no effect.\n   ```\n   5 3\n   ```\n\n9. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: Reverse the order of columns.\n   ```\n   3 5\n   ```\n\n10. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: Swap elements symmetrically across the main diagonal. For a 1x2 matrix, this operation has no effect.\n    ```\n    3 5\n    ```\n\n11. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: Reverse the order of columns.\n    ```\n    5 3\n    ```\n\nThe final matrix after performing all the operations is:\n```\n5 3\n```\n\nTherefore, the final output is:\n<<<5 3>>>"
