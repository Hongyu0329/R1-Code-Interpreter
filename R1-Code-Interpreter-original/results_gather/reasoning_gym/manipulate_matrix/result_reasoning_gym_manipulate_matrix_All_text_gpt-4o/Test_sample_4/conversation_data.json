    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of matrix operations step by step on the given matrix. Let's analyze each operation carefully:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   0 4\n   1 0\n   8 2\n   3 4\n   6 5\n   8 4\n   8 1\n   ```\n\n2. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: The counterdiagonal of a matrix is the diagonal from the top-right to the bottom-left. For a 2-column matrix, this operation swaps the elements in each row. The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   4 0\n   0 1\n   2 8\n   4 3\n   5 6\n   4 8\n   1 8\n   ```\n\n3. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: Repeating the same operation as step 2, the matrix returns to its original form:\n   ```\n   0 4\n   1 0\n   8 2\n   3 4\n   6 5\n   8 4\n   8 1\n   ```\n\n4. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: For a 2-column matrix, this operation swaps the rows and columns, effectively transposing the matrix. The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   0 1 8 3 6 8 8\n   4 0 2 4 5 4 1\n   ```\n\n5. **Crop the matrix to rows 2-2 and columns 4-5 (1-indexed)**: This operation attempts to select a submatrix. However, the specified range is invalid because the matrix only has 2 rows after transposition. Thus, this operation results in an empty matrix.\n\n6. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: Mirroring an empty matrix still results in an empty matrix.\n\n7. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: Mirroring an empty matrix along the counterdiagonal still results in an empty matrix.\n\n8. **Crop the matrix to rows 2-2 and columns 1-1 (1-indexed)**: Again, this operation on an empty matrix results in an empty matrix.\n\n9. **Crop the matrix to rows 1-1 and columns 1-1 (1-indexed)**: This operation on an empty matrix results in an empty matrix.\n\n10. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: Mirroring an empty matrix still results in an empty matrix.\n\n11. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: Mirroring an empty matrix along the counterdiagonal still results in an empty matrix.\n\nAfter performing all the operations, the final matrix is empty. Therefore, the output is:\n\n<<<>>>"
