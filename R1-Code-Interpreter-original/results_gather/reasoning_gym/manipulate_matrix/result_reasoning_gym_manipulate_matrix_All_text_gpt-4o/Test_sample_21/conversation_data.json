    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's break down each step:\n\n1. **Identity Transformation**: This step means we do nothing to the matrix. The matrix remains the same as the input.\n\n   Initial matrix:\n   ```\n   8 7 8 5 7 0 0 2 5\n   2 4 0 2 0 5 3 7 3\n   3 2 2 5 8 5 8 6 0\n   5 4 2 1 8 6 6 7 3\n   2 0 7 7 3 5 9 3 2\n   ```\n\n2. **Rotate the Matrix 90 Degrees**: To rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we need to transform the rows into columns. The first row becomes the last column, the second row becomes the second last column, and so on.\n\n   After rotating 90 degrees clockwise, the matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   2 5 3 2 8\n   0 4 2 7 7\n   7 2 2 0 8\n   7 1 5 2 5\n   3 8 8 0 7\n   5 6 5 5 0\n   9 6 8 3 0\n   3 7 6 7 2\n   2 3 0 3 5\n   ```\n\n3. **Remove Every 2-nd Row (1-indexed)**: In this step, we remove every second row from the matrix, considering the rows are 1-indexed. This means we remove the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, etc., rows.\n\n   After removing every 2-nd row, the matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   2 5 3 2 8\n   7 2 2 0 8\n   3 8 8 0 7\n   9 6 8 3 0\n   2 3 0 3 5\n   ```\n\nFinally, we format the matrix as specified, enclosed within triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<\n2 5 3 2 8\n7 2 2 0 8\n3 8 8 0 7\n9 6 8 3 0\n2 3 0 3 5\n>>>"
