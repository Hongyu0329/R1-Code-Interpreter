    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   The given matrix is:\n   ```\n   4 3\n   3 2\n   1 8\n   ```\n\n2. **Identity Transformation:**\n   - The identity transformation means no change to the matrix. So, the matrix remains:\n     ```\n     4 3\n     3 2\n     1 8\n     ```\n\n3. **Map each occurrence of 0 to 9:**\n   - In this step, we need to replace every 0 in the matrix with 9. However, the given matrix does not contain any 0s. Therefore, the matrix remains unchanged:\n     ```\n     4 3\n     3 2\n     1 8\n     ```\n\n4. **Rotate the matrix 180 degrees:**\n   - Rotating a matrix 180 degrees involves flipping it upside down and reversing each row. Let's perform this operation:\n     - First, flip the matrix upside down:\n       ```\n       1 8\n       3 2\n       4 3\n       ```\n     - Then, reverse each row:\n       ```\n       8 1\n       2 3\n       3 4\n       ```\n\n5. **Final Matrix:**\n   - After performing all the operations, the final matrix is:\n     ```\n     8 1\n     2 3\n     3 4\n     ```\n\nNow, we will format the final matrix as specified, enclosed within triple angle brackets:\n\n```\n<<<8 1\n2 3\n3 4>>>\n```"
