    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's go through each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   8 4 2 2 4 2 0 6 7\n   9 1 3 4 8 2 1 7 1\n   5 5 7 1 7 2 0 3 5\n   4 0 8 5 8 7 6 6 4\n   ```\n\n2. **Remove every 6-th column (1-indexed)**: The 6th column is removed. The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   8 4 2 2 4 0 6 7\n   9 1 3 4 8 1 7 1\n   5 5 7 1 7 0 3 5\n   4 0 8 5 8 6 6 4\n   ```\n\n3. **Rotate the matrix 270 degrees**: Rotating 270 degrees is equivalent to rotating 90 degrees counterclockwise. The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   7 1 5 4\n   6 7 0 8\n   0 1 7 8\n   4 4 1 5\n   2 8 3 7\n   2 4 5 1\n   2 3 7 8\n   4 1 5 0\n   ```\n\n4. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: This means reversing each row. The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   4 1 5 0\n   2 3 7 8\n   2 4 5 1\n   2 8 3 7\n   4 4 1 5\n   0 1 7 8\n   6 7 0 8\n   7 1 5 4\n   ```\n\n5. **Set all elements divisible by 4 to zero**: Replace elements divisible by 4 with zero. The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   0 1 5 0\n   2 3 7 8\n   2 0 5 1\n   2 8 3 7\n   0 0 1 5\n   0 1 7 8\n   6 7 0 8\n   7 1 5 0\n   ```\n\n6. **Vertically mirror the matrix**: This means reversing the order of the rows. The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   7 1 5 0\n   6 7 0 8\n   0 1 7 8\n   0 0 1 5\n   2 8 3 7\n   2 0 5 1\n   2 3 7 8\n   0 1 5 0\n   ```\n\n7. **Vertically mirror the matrix**: Reversing the order of the rows again returns the matrix to its previous state:\n   ```\n   0 1 5 0\n   2 3 7 8\n   2 0 5 1\n   2 8 3 7\n   0 0 1 5\n   0 1 7 8\n   6 7 0 8\n   7 1 5 0\n   ```\n\n8. **Rotate the matrix 90 degrees**: Rotating 90 degrees clockwise. The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   0 2 2 2 0 0 6 7\n   1 3 0 8 0 1 7 1\n   5 7 5 3 1 7 0 5\n   0 8 1 7 5 8 8 0\n   ```\n\nThe final matrix after all operations is:\n```\n0 2 2 2 0 0 6 7\n1 3 0 8 0 1 7 1\n5 7 5 3 1 7 0 5\n0 8 1 7 5 8 8 0\n```\n\nEnclosed within triple angle brackets, the final matrix is:\n<<<0 2 2 2 0 0 6 7\n1 3 0 8 0 1 7 1\n5 7 5 3 1 7 0 5\n0 8 1 7 5 8 8 0>>>"
