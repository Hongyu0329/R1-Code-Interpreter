    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's go through each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: No change to the matrix.\n\n2. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: The counterdiagonal runs from the bottom-left to the top-right. After mirroring, the matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   1 1 2 9 3\n   4 4 6 5 8\n   7 5 8 1 5\n   4 0 1 9 4\n   8 5 2 7 0\n   ```\n\n3. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal again**: This operation reverses the previous mirroring, so the matrix returns to its original form:\n   ```\n   8 5 2 7 0 2 5 8\n   4 9 8 4 1 1 0 4\n   5 1 7 2 6 8 5 7\n   5 7 5 8 5 6 4 4\n   3 9 0 2 9 2 1 1\n   ```\n\n4. **Map each occurrence of 5 to 6**: Replace all 5s with 6s:\n   ```\n   8 6 2 7 0 2 6 8\n   4 9 8 4 1 1 0 4\n   6 1 7 2 6 8 6 7\n   6 7 6 8 6 6 4 4\n   3 9 0 2 9 2 1 1\n   ```\n\n5. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: The diagonal runs from the top-left to the bottom-right. After mirroring, the matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   8 4 6 6 3\n   6 9 1 7 9\n   2 8 7 6 0\n   7 4 2 8 2\n   0 1 6 6 1\n   2 1 8 6 1\n   6 0 6 4 1\n   8 4 7 4 1\n   ```\n\n6. **Remove every 5-th row (1-indexed)**: Remove the 5th row:\n   ```\n   8 4 6 6 3\n   6 9 1 7 9\n   2 8 7 6 0\n   7 4 2 8 2\n   2 1 8 6 1\n   6 0 6 4 1\n   8 4 7 4 1\n   ```\n\n7. **Crop the matrix to rows 4-4 and columns 4-5 (1-indexed)**: Extract the element at row 4, columns 4-5:\n   ```\n   8 2\n   ```\n\n8. **Map each occurrence of 5 to 7**: There are no 5s in the current matrix, so no change.\n\n9. **Crop the matrix to rows 1-1 and columns 1-2 (1-indexed)**: The matrix remains the same as it is already 1 row and 2 columns:\n   ```\n   8 2\n   ```\n\n10. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: Reverse the order of elements in the row:\n    ```\n    2 8\n    ```\n\n11. **Rotate the matrix 90 degrees**: Rotate the matrix clockwise:\n    ```\n    2\n    8\n    ```\n\nThe final matrix after performing all the operations is:\n```\n2\n8\n```\n\nEnclosed within triple angle brackets, the final output is:\n<<<2\n8>>>"
