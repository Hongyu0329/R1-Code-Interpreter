    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   The given matrix is:\n   ```\n   6 3 1 5 0 0 2\n   6 5 1 4 5 5 4\n   2 8 0 9 7 8 7\n   7 5 3 5 8 8 5\n   0 2 0 1 7 8 3\n   5 1 2 9 1 8 4\n   9 4 4 3 6 6 9\n   ```\n\n2. **Identity Transformation:**\n   - The identity transformation means no change is made to the matrix. Therefore, the matrix remains the same:\n   ```\n   6 3 1 5 0 0 2\n   6 5 1 4 5 5 4\n   2 8 0 9 7 8 7\n   7 5 3 5 8 8 5\n   0 2 0 1 7 8 3\n   5 1 2 9 1 8 4\n   9 4 4 3 6 6 9\n   ```\n\n3. **Vertically Mirror the Matrix:**\n   - Vertically mirroring the matrix means reversing the order of the rows. The first row becomes the last, the second row becomes the second last, and so on. Let's perform this operation:\n   ```\n   9 4 4 3 6 6 9\n   5 1 2 9 1 8 4\n   0 2 0 1 7 8 3\n   7 5 3 5 8 8 5\n   2 8 0 9 7 8 7\n   6 5 1 4 5 5 4\n   6 3 1 5 0 0 2\n   ```\n\n4. **Final Matrix:**\n   - After performing all the operations, the final matrix is:\n   ```\n   9 4 4 3 6 6 9\n   5 1 2 9 1 8 4\n   0 2 0 1 7 8 3\n   7 5 3 5 8 8 5\n   2 8 0 9 7 8 7\n   6 5 1 4 5 5 4\n   6 3 1 5 0 0 2\n   ```\n\n5. **Output the Final Matrix:**\n   - The final matrix should be enclosed within triple angle brackets as specified:\n   ```\n   <<<9 4 4 3 6 6 9\n   5 1 2 9 1 8 4\n   0 2 0 1 7 8 3\n   7 5 3 5 8 8 5\n   2 8 0 9 7 8 7\n   6 5 1 4 5 5 4\n   6 3 1 5 0 0 2>>>\n   ```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n<<<9 4 4 3 6 6 9\n5 1 2 9 1 8 4\n0 2 0 1 7 8 3\n7 5 3 5 8 8 5\n2 8 0 9 7 8 7\n6 5 1 4 5 5 4\n6 3 1 5 0 0 2>>>"
