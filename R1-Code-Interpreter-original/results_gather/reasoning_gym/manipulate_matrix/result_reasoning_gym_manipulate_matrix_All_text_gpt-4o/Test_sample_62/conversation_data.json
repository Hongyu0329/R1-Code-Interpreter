    "To solve the problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's go through each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identity Transformation**: This means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains the same:\n   ```\n   1 4 4 6\n   0 7 5 4\n   6 9 4 8\n   0 6 0 6\n   5 7 5 3\n   0 6 7 2\n   4 2 1 4\n   7 4 1 5\n   6 5 0 8\n   0 4 3 0\n   ```\n\n2. **Mirror the Matrix Along the Diagonal**: This operation transposes the matrix. The rows become columns:\n   ```\n   1 0 6 0 5 0 4 7 6 0\n   4 7 9 6 7 6 2 4 5 4\n   4 5 4 0 5 7 1 1 0 3\n   6 4 8 6 3 2 4 5 8 0\n   ```\n\n3. **Vertically Mirror the Matrix**: This operation flips the matrix upside down:\n   ```\n   6 4 8 6 3 2 4 5 8 0\n   4 5 4 0 5 7 1 1 0 3\n   4 7 9 6 7 6 2 4 5 4\n   1 0 6 0 5 0 4 7 6 0\n   ```\n\n4. **Rotate the Matrix 180 Degrees**: This operation rotates the matrix by 180 degrees:\n   ```\n   0 6 7 4 0 5 0 6 0 1\n   4 5 4 2 6 7 6 9 7 4\n   3 0 1 1 7 5 0 4 5 4\n   0 8 5 4 2 3 6 8 4 6\n   ```\n\n5. **Set All Elements Divisible by 8 to Zero**: Replace elements divisible by 8 with zero:\n   ```\n   0 6 7 4 0 5 0 6 0 1\n   4 5 4 2 6 7 6 9 7 4\n   3 0 1 1 7 5 0 4 5 4\n   0 0 5 4 2 3 6 0 4 6\n   ```\n\n6. **Map Each Occurrence of 3 to 7**: Replace all 3s with 7s:\n   ```\n   0 6 7 4 0 5 0 6 0 1\n   4 5 4 2 6 7 6 9 7 4\n   7 0 1 1 7 5 0 4 5 4\n   0 0 5 4 2 7 6 0 4 6\n   ```\n\n7. **Rotate the Matrix 180 Degrees**: Rotate the matrix by 180 degrees again:\n   ```\n   6 4 0 6 7 2 4 5 0 0\n   4 5 4 0 5 7 1 1 0 7\n   4 7 9 6 7 6 2 4 5 4\n   1 0 6 0 5 0 4 7 6 0\n   ```\n\n8. **Map Each Occurrence of 8 to 1**: There are no 8s in the matrix, so no change is needed.\n\n9. **Set All Elements Divisible by 5 to Zero**: Replace elements divisible by 5 with zero:\n   ```\n   6 4 0 6 7 2 4 0 0 0\n   4 0 4 0 0 7 1 1 0 7\n   4 7 9 6 7 6 2 4 0 4\n   1 0 6 0 0 0 4 7 6 0\n   ```\n\nThe final matrix after all operations is:\n```\n6 4 0 6 7 2 4 0 0 0\n4 0 4 0 0 7 1 1 0 7\n4 7 9 6 7 6 2 4 0 4\n1 0 6 0 0 0 4 7 6 0\n```\n\nEnclosed within triple angle brackets, the final matrix is:\n<<<6 4 0 6 7 2 4 0 0 0\n4 0 4 0 0 7 1 1 0 7\n4 7 9 6 7 6 2 4 0 4\n1 0 6 0 0 0 4 7 6 0>>>"
