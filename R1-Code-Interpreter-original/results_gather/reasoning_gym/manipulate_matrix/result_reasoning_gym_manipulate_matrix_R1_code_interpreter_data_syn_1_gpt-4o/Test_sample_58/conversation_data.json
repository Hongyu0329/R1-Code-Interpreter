    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identity Transformation**: This means we do not change the matrix. We simply take the matrix as it is.\n\n2. **Remove every 3rd column (1-indexed)**: This means we need to remove the 3rd column from the matrix. In a 1-indexed system, the 3rd column is the column at index 2 in a 0-indexed system.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these operations on the given matrix.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [7, 9, 9],\n    [4, 5, 7],\n    [9, 4, 4],\n    [7, 4, 5],\n    [1, 8, 2]\n])\n\n# Remove every 3rd column (1-indexed), which is index 2 in 0-indexed\nfinal_matrix = np.delete(matrix, 2, axis=1)\n\n# Print the final matrix\nprint(final_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will output the matrix after removing the 3rd column. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matrix is as expected after removing the 3rd column. Now, let's format the final matrix output according to the specified format.\n\nThe final matrix after performing the operations is:\n\n```\n7 9\n4 5\n9 4\n7 4\n1 8\n```\n\nNow, let's enclose this matrix within triple angle brackets as required:\n\n<<<7 9\n4 5\n9 4\n7 4\n1 8>>>"
