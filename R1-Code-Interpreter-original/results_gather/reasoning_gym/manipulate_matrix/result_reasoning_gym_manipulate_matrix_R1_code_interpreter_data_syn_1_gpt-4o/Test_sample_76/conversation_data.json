    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of transformations on the given matrix. Let's break down each step:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix.\n\n2. **Rotate the matrix 360 degrees**: Rotating a matrix 360 degrees results in the same matrix, so no change is needed.\n\n3. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: This involves reversing the order of columns in each row.\n\n4. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: This involves transposing the matrix, which means converting rows to columns and vice versa.\n\n5. **Remove every 3rd column (1-indexed)**: This means removing the 3rd column from the transposed matrix.\n\nLet's implement these steps in Python to get the final matrix.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [6, 4, 6],\n    [3, 1, 4],\n    [3, 2, 3],\n    [5, 3, 1]\n])\n\n# Step 1: Identity transformation (no change)\n# Step 2: Rotate 360 degrees (no change)\n\n# Step 3: Horizontally mirror the matrix\nmatrix = np.fliplr(matrix)\n\n# Step 4: Mirror the matrix along the diagonal (transpose)\nmatrix = matrix.T\n\n# Step 5: Remove every 3rd column (1-indexed)\nmatrix = np.delete(matrix, 2, axis=1)\n\n# Print the final matrix\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to see the final matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the final matrix after performing all the operations is:\n\n```\n6 4 1\n4 1 3\n6 3 5\n```\n\nThis matrix is the result of applying the specified transformations to the original matrix. \n\n<<<6 4 1\n4 1 3\n6 3 5>>>"
