    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identity Transformation**: This means we do not change the matrix in this step. We simply take the matrix as it is.\n\n2. **Map each occurrence of 6 to 2**: We need to iterate through the matrix and replace every occurrence of the number 6 with the number 2.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these operations and output the final matrix.\n\n```python\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [6, 3, 7, 4, 4, 8],\n    [1, 7, 2, 7, 8, 2],\n    [1, 5, 2, 6, 7, 8]\n]\n\n# Perform the mapping of 6 to 2\nfor i in range(len(matrix)):\n    for j in range(len(matrix[i])):\n        if matrix[i][j] == 6:\n            matrix[i][j] = 2\n\n# Print the final matrix\nfor row in matrix:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nThis code will replace all occurrences of 6 with 2 in the matrix and then print the final matrix. Let's execute this code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors. The output matrix is the result of performing the specified operations on the initial matrix. Now, let's format the final matrix output as requested:\n\n<<<\n2 3 7 4 4 8\n1 7 2 7 8 2\n1 5 2 2 7 8\n>>>"
