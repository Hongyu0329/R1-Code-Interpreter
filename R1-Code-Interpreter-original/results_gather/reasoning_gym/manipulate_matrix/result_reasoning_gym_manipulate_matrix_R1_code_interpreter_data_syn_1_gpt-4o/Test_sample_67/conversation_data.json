    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of matrix transformations step by step. Let's break down each operation and implement them using Python:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix.\n2. **Set all elements divisible by 3 to zero**: We'll iterate through the matrix and set elements divisible by 3 to zero.\n3. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: This involves transposing the matrix.\n4. **Rotate the matrix 270 degrees**: This is equivalent to rotating the matrix 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n5. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: This involves reversing each row.\n6. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: This involves reversing the order of both rows and columns.\n7. **Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed)**: We'll remove rows with odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...).\n8. **Set all elements divisible by 8 to zero**: We'll iterate through the matrix again and set elements divisible by 8 to zero.\n\nLet's implement these steps in Python:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [3, 9, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1, 4],\n    [6, 8, 8, 1, 9, 7, 3, 6],\n    [9, 9, 3, 5, 6, 3, 2, 7],\n    [2, 9, 5, 1, 8, 1, 7, 5],\n    [6, 0, 4, 8, 0, 6, 3, 5],\n    [8, 1, 7, 8, 3, 9, 7, 0],\n    [5, 2, 3, 2, 7, 9, 2, 8],\n    [2, 0, 1, 0, 2, 7, 6, 1]\n])\n\n# Step 2: Set all elements divisible by 3 to zero\nmatrix[matrix % 3 == 0] = 0\n\n# Step 3: Mirror the matrix along the diagonal (transpose)\nmatrix = matrix.T\n\n# Step 4: Rotate the matrix 270 degrees (90 degrees counterclockwise)\nmatrix = np.rot90(matrix, k=1)\n\n# Step 5: Horizontally mirror the matrix\nmatrix = np.fliplr(matrix)\n\n# Step 6: Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal\nmatrix = np.flipud(np.fliplr(matrix))\n\n# Step 7: Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed)\nmatrix = np.delete(matrix, np.arange(1, matrix.shape[0], 2), axis=0)\n\n# Step 8: Set all elements divisible by 8 to zero\nmatrix[matrix % 8 == 0] = 0\n\n# Print the final matrix\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the final matrix.",
