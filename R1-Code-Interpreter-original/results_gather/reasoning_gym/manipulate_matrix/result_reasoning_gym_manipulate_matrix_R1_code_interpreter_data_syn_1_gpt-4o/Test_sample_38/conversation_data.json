    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identity Transformation**: This means no change to the matrix. The matrix remains the same.\n\n2. **Rotate the Matrix 360 Degrees**: Rotating a matrix 360 degrees results in the same matrix, as a full rotation brings it back to its original orientation.\n\n3. **Mirror the Matrix Along the Diagonal**: This operation involves transposing the matrix. Transposing a matrix means converting its rows into columns and vice versa.\n\nGiven the matrix:\n```\n7 7 2 5 1 2\n9 3 6 6 3 6\n1 8 5 4 6 7\n```\n\nAfter the identity transformation and 360-degree rotation, the matrix remains:\n```\n7 7 2 5 1 2\n9 3 6 6 3 6\n1 8 5 4 6 7\n```\n\nNow, let's transpose the matrix. The transposed matrix will have its rows and columns swapped.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform the transposition:\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [7, 7, 2, 5, 1, 2],\n    [9, 3, 6, 6, 3, 6],\n    [1, 8, 5, 4, 6, 7]\n]\n\n# Transpose the matrix\ntransposed_matrix = [[matrix[j][i] for j in range(len(matrix))] for i in range(len(matrix[0]))]\n\n# Print the transposed matrix\nfor row in transposed_matrix:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nThis code will transpose the matrix, and the output will be the final matrix after all operations. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the transposed matrix. Now, let's format the final matrix output as required:\n\nThe transposed matrix is:\n```\n7 9 1\n7 3 8\n2 6 5\n5 6 4\n1 3 6\n2 6 7\n```\n\nThis is the result of mirroring the original matrix along its diagonal. Now, let's present the final answer in the specified format:\n\n<<<\n7 9 1\n7 3 8\n2 6 5\n5 6 4\n1 3 6\n2 6 7\n>>>"
