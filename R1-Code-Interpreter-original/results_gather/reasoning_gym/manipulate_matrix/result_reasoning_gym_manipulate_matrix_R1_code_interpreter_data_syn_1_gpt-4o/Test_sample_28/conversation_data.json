    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of matrix transformations step by step. Let's break down each operation and apply it to the given matrix.\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: No change to the matrix.\n\n2. **Vertically mirror the matrix**: Swap the first row with the last, the second with the second last, and so on.\n\n3. **Remove every 3rd column (1-indexed)**: Remove columns 3 and 6.\n\n4. **Crop the matrix to rows 3-4 and columns 2-4 (1-indexed)**: Extract a submatrix from the specified rows and columns.\n\n5. **Set all elements divisible by 2 to zero**: Replace elements divisible by 2 with zero.\n\n6. **Map each occurrence of 7 to 5**: Replace 7s with 5s.\n\n7. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: Transpose the matrix.\n\n8. **Remove every 2nd row (1-indexed)**: Remove rows 2 and 4.\n\n9. **Rotate the matrix 90 degrees**: Rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise.\n\n10. **Rotate the matrix 360 degrees**: This operation results in no change.\n\nLet's implement these steps in Python to get the final matrix.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [9, 2, 4, 3, 7, 7],\n    [5, 0, 1, 2, 2, 6],\n    [0, 3, 0, 6, 2, 2],\n    [4, 9, 2, 8, 9, 8],\n    [9, 0, 9, 9, 1, 4],\n    [2, 0, 9, 3, 4, 3]\n])\n\n# Step 2: Vertically mirror the matrix\nmatrix = matrix[::-1]\n\n# Step 3: Remove every 3rd column (1-indexed)\nmatrix = np.delete(matrix, [2, 5], axis=1)\n\n# Step 4: Crop the matrix to rows 3-4 and columns 2-4 (1-indexed)\nmatrix = matrix[2:4, 1:4]\n\n# Step 5: Set all elements divisible by 2 to zero\nmatrix[matrix % 2 == 0] = 0\n\n# Step 6: Map each occurrence of 7 to 5\nmatrix[matrix == 7] = 5\n\n# Step 7: Mirror the matrix along the diagonal (transpose)\nmatrix = matrix.T\n\n# Step 8: Remove every 2nd row (1-indexed)\nmatrix = np.delete(matrix, [1], axis=0)\n\n# Step 9: Rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\nmatrix = np.rot90(matrix, -1)\n\n# Step 10: Rotate the matrix 360 degrees (no change)\n# No operation needed\n\n# Print the final matrix\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the final matrix.",
