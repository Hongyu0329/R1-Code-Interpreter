    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of transformations on the given matrix. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means we start with the matrix as it is.\n2. **Map each occurrence of 6 to 5**: We need to replace any 6s with 5s. However, there are no 6s in the matrix, so this step doesn't change anything.\n3. **Set all elements divisible by 3 to zero**: We will iterate through the matrix and set any element divisible by 3 to zero.\n4. **Set all elements divisible by 8 to zero**: Similarly, we will set any element divisible by 8 to zero.\n5. **Rotate the matrix 90 degrees**: This involves transposing the matrix and then reversing the order of columns.\n6. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: This involves reversing the order of elements in each row.\n\nLet's implement these steps in Python to get the final matrix.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [7, 0],\n    [8, 5],\n    [3, 7],\n    [7, 8],\n    [5, 9],\n    [2, 8]\n])\n\n# Step 1: Identity transformation (no change)\n# Step 2: Map each occurrence of 6 to 5 (no 6s in the matrix)\n\n# Step 3: Set all elements divisible by 3 to zero\nmatrix[matrix % 3 == 0] = 0\n\n# Step 4: Set all elements divisible by 8 to zero\nmatrix[matrix % 8 == 0] = 0\n\n# Step 5: Rotate the matrix 90 degrees\nmatrix = np.rot90(matrix, -1)\n\n# Step 6: Horizontally mirror the matrix\nmatrix = np.fliplr(matrix)\n\n# Print the final matrix\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the final matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the final matrix after performing all the operations is:\n\n```\n[[7 0 0 7 5 2]\n [0 5 7 0 0 0]]\n```\n\nNow, let's format this matrix according to the required output format:\n\n<<<7 0 0 7 5 2\n0 5 7 0 0 0>>>"
