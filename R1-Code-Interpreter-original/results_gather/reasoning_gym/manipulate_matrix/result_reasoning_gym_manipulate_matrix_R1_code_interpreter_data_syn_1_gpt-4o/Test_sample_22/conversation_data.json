    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. The operations are:\n\n1. Identity transformation: This means we do nothing to the matrix, so it remains unchanged.\n2. Vertically mirror the matrix: This operation involves flipping the matrix along its vertical axis. In other words, we reverse the order of the columns in each row.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n- Start with the original matrix.\n- For each row, reverse the order of the elements to achieve the vertical mirroring.\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to perform these operations and output the final matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [8, 4, 7, 7, 6, 3, 7, 5, 9],\n    [6, 3, 3, 0, 7, 8, 7, 9, 1],\n    [8, 5, 8, 4, 6, 4, 8, 2, 1],\n    [4, 4, 7, 9, 0, 6, 0, 5, 4]\n]\n\n# Vertically mirror the matrix\nmirrored_matrix = [row[::-1] for row in matrix]\n\n# Print the final matrix\nfor row in mirrored_matrix:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nThis code will reverse each row of the matrix, effectively mirroring it vertically. Let's execute this code to get the final matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the vertically mirrored version of the original matrix. Now, let's format the final output as specified, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final matrix after performing the operations is:\n\n<<<\n9 5 7 3 6 7 7 4 8\n1 9 7 8 7 0 3 3 6\n1 2 8 4 6 4 8 5 8\n4 5 0 6 0 9 7 4 4\n>>>"
