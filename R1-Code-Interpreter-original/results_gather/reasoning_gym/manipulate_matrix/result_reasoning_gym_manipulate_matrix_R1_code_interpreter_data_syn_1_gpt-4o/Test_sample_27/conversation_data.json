    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identity Transformation**: This means we do nothing to the matrix initially.\n\n2. **Remove every 2-nd column (1-indexed)**: This means we remove the second column from the matrix.\n\n3. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: This involves reversing the order of columns in each row.\n\n4. **Set all elements divisible by 6 to zero**: We need to check each element in the matrix and set it to zero if it is divisible by 6.\n\nLet's implement these steps in Python to get the final matrix.\n\n```python\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [7, 0, 2],\n    [4, 0, 9],\n    [0, 7, 6],\n    [7, 8, 4],\n    [2, 9, 5]\n]\n\n# Step 2: Remove every 2-nd column (1-indexed)\nmatrix = [[row[0], row[2]] for row in matrix]\n\n# Step 3: Horizontally mirror the matrix\nmatrix = [row[::-1] for row in matrix]\n\n# Step 4: Set all elements divisible by 6 to zero\nmatrix = [[0 if element % 6 == 0 else element for element in row] for row in matrix]\n\n# Print the final matrix\nfor row in matrix:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nThis code will execute the operations in sequence and print the final matrix. Let's see the output.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matches the expected result after performing the specified operations on the matrix. Let's summarize the steps and the final matrix:\n\n1. **Identity Transformation**: The matrix remains unchanged initially.\n\n2. **Remove every 2-nd column (1-indexed)**: The second column is removed, resulting in:\n   ```\n   7 2\n   4 9\n   0 6\n   7 4\n   2 5\n   ```\n\n3. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: Each row is reversed:\n   ```\n   2 7\n   9 4\n   6 0\n   4 7\n   5 2\n   ```\n\n4. **Set all elements divisible by 6 to zero**: Elements divisible by 6 are set to zero:\n   ```\n   2 7\n   9 4\n   0 0\n   4 7\n   5 2\n   ```\n\nThe final matrix after all operations is:\n```\n2 7\n9 4\n0 0\n4 7\n5 2\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2 7\n9 4\n0 0\n4 7\n5 2>>>"
