    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of transformations on the given matrix. Let's break down the steps and implement them one by one:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix.\n2. **Set all elements divisible by 5 to zero**: We will iterate through the matrix and set any element divisible by 5 to zero.\n3. **Map each occurrence of 3 to 4**: We will replace all occurrences of the number 3 with 4.\n4. **Remove every 5-th row (1-indexed)**: We will remove the 5th row from the matrix.\n5. **Remove every 3-th row (1-indexed)**: After removing the 5th row, we will remove the 3rd row.\n6. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: This involves swapping elements across the counterdiagonal.\n7. **Set all elements divisible by 3 to zero**: Finally, we will set any element divisible by 3 to zero.\n\nLet's implement these steps in Python:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [1, 8, 1, 5, 8],\n    [4, 4, 5, 7, 0],\n    [8, 8, 2, 2, 0],\n    [4, 2, 7, 9, 3],\n    [2, 2, 2, 8, 3],\n    [2, 6, 0, 3, 8]\n])\n\n# Step 2: Set all elements divisible by 5 to zero\nmatrix[matrix % 5 == 0] = 0\n\n# Step 3: Map each occurrence of 3 to 4\nmatrix[matrix == 3] = 4\n\n# Step 4: Remove every 5-th row (1-indexed)\nmatrix = np.delete(matrix, 4, axis=0)\n\n# Step 5: Remove every 3-th row (1-indexed)\nmatrix = np.delete(matrix, 2, axis=0)\n\n# Step 6: Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal\nn = matrix.shape[0]\nm = matrix.shape[1]\nmirrored_matrix = np.zeros((m, n), dtype=int)\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(m):\n        mirrored_matrix[j, i] = matrix[n - i - 1, m - j - 1]\n\n# Step 7: Set all elements divisible by 3 to zero\nmirrored_matrix[mirrored_matrix % 3 == 0] = 0\n\n# Print the final matrix\nprint(mirrored_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will execute the transformations step by step and output the final matrix. Let's see the result.",
