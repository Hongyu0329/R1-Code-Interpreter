    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identity Transformation**: This step involves no change to the matrix, so we can proceed to the next step with the matrix as it is.\n\n2. **Mirror the Matrix Along the Diagonal**: This operation involves transposing the matrix. In a transpose operation, the element at position (i, j) in the original matrix moves to position (j, i) in the transposed matrix.\n\n3. **Set All Elements Divisible by 7 to Zero**: After transposing the matrix, we need to iterate through the matrix and set any element that is divisible by 7 to zero.\n\nLet's implement these steps in Python to get the final matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [8, 1, 4, 5, 8],\n    [5, 1, 5, 0, 4],\n    [6, 1, 7, 8, 9],\n    [1, 3, 4, 2, 8]\n]\n\n# Step 2: Transpose the matrix\ntransposed_matrix = [[matrix[j][i] for j in range(len(matrix))] for i in range(len(matrix[0]))]\n\n# Step 3: Set elements divisible by 7 to zero\nfor i in range(len(transposed_matrix)):\n    for j in range(len(transposed_matrix[0])):\n        if transposed_matrix[i][j] % 7 == 0:\n            transposed_matrix[i][j] = 0\n\n# Print the final matrix\nfor row in transposed_matrix:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nThis code will transpose the matrix and then set any element divisible by 7 to zero. Let's execute this code to get the final matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the final matrix after performing the specified operations. Let's format the output matrix according to the required format and provide the final answer.\n\nThe final matrix is:\n```\n8 5 6 1\n1 1 1 3\n4 5 0 4\n5 0 8 2\n8 4 9 8\n```\n\nNow, let's enclose this matrix within triple angle brackets as requested:\n\n<<<8 5 6 1\n1 1 1 3\n4 5 0 4\n5 0 8 2\n8 4 9 8>>>"
