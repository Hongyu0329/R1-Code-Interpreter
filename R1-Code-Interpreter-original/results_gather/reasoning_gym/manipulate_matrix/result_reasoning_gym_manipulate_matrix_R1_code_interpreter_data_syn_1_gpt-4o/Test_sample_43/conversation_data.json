    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of matrix operations step by step. Let's break down each operation and apply it to the given matrix.\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix.\n\n2. **Remove every 9-th row (1-indexed)**: Since the matrix has 9 rows, we will remove the 9th row.\n\n3. **Crop the matrix to rows 2-5 and columns 5-7 (1-indexed)**: This means we will take a submatrix from the original matrix that includes rows 2 to 5 and columns 5 to 7.\n\n4. **Remove every 3-th column (1-indexed)**: After cropping, we will remove the 3rd column of the resulting submatrix.\n\n5. **Remove every 3-th row (1-indexed)**: After removing the column, we will remove the 3rd row of the resulting matrix.\n\n6. **Rotate the matrix 360 degrees**: Rotating a matrix 360 degrees results in the same matrix, so no change is needed.\n\nLet's implement these steps in Python to get the final matrix.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [7, 0, 8, 7, 5, 1, 5, 1],\n    [4, 4, 7, 5, 9, 7, 4, 6],\n    [0, 6, 8, 9, 7, 3, 2, 3],\n    [2, 4, 7, 9, 2, 7, 0, 4],\n    [9, 0, 1, 0, 4, 5, 3, 0],\n    [1, 6, 1, 4, 5, 8, 1, 7],\n    [4, 4, 9, 3, 3, 6, 0, 0],\n    [4, 5, 7, 4, 0, 8, 2, 8],\n    [8, 7, 0, 4, 8, 5, 2, 5]\n])\n\n# Step 2: Remove every 9-th row (1-indexed)\nmatrix = np.delete(matrix, 8, axis=0)\n\n# Step 3: Crop the matrix to rows 2-5 and columns 5-7 (1-indexed)\nmatrix = matrix[1:5, 4:7]\n\n# Step 4: Remove every 3-th column (1-indexed)\nmatrix = np.delete(matrix, 2, axis=1)\n\n# Step 5: Remove every 3-th row (1-indexed)\nmatrix = np.delete(matrix, 2, axis=0)\n\n# Step 6: Rotate the matrix 360 degrees (no change)\n# Final matrix\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the final matrix.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the final matrix after performing all the specified operations. The matrix is:\n\n```\n[[9 7]\n [7 3]\n [4 5]]\n```\n\nNow, let's format this matrix according to the required output format:\n\n<<<9 7\n7 3\n4 5>>>"
