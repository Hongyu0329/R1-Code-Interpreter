    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of transformations on the given matrix. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identity Transformation**: This means no change to the matrix. We start with the original matrix.\n\n2. **Mirror the Matrix Along the Diagonal**: This operation involves transposing the matrix, which means converting rows to columns and vice versa.\n\n3. **Horizontally Mirror the Matrix**: This operation involves reversing the order of rows in the matrix.\n\n4. **Vertically Mirror the Matrix**: This operation involves reversing the order of elements in each row.\n\nLet's implement these transformations step by step using Python code.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [3, 0, 3, 7, 6],\n    [5, 4, 4, 7, 9],\n    [6, 4, 9, 1, 0],\n    [7, 3, 7, 1, 7],\n    [8, 6, 5, 0, 1]\n])\n\n# Identity transformation (no change)\nidentity_matrix = matrix.copy()\n\n# Mirror the matrix along the diagonal (transpose)\ntransposed_matrix = identity_matrix.T\n\n# Horizontally mirror the matrix (reverse the order of rows)\nhorizontally_mirrored_matrix = transposed_matrix[::-1]\n\n# Vertically mirror the matrix (reverse the order of elements in each row)\nfinal_matrix = np.array([row[::-1] for row in horizontally_mirrored_matrix])\n\n# Print the final matrix\nfor row in final_matrix:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nThis code will execute the transformations in the specified order and print the final matrix. Let's see the output.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matrix is the result of performing the specified transformations on the original matrix. Let's verify the steps and ensure the transformations were applied correctly:\n\n1. **Identity Transformation**: The matrix remains unchanged.\n2. **Mirror the Matrix Along the Diagonal**: This is equivalent to transposing the matrix.\n3. **Horizontally Mirror the Matrix**: Reverse the order of rows.\n4. **Vertically Mirror the Matrix**: Reverse the order of elements in each row.\n\nThe final matrix after all transformations is:\n\n```\n1 7 0 9 6\n0 1 1 7 7\n5 7 9 4 3\n6 3 4 4 0\n8 7 6 5 3\n```\n\nThis matrix is the result of applying the transformations in sequence. Now, let's format the final answer as requested:\n\n<<<\n1 7 0 9 6\n0 1 1 7 7\n5 7 9 4 3\n6 3 4 4 0\n8 7 6 5 3\n>>>"
