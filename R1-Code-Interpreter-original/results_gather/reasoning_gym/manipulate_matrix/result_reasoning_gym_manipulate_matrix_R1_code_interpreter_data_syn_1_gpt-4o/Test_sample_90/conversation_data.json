    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of matrix transformations. Let's break down each step:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix.\n2. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: This involves swapping elements such that the element at position (i, j) is swapped with the element at position (n-j-1, n-i-1), where n is the size of the matrix.\n3. **Vertically mirror the matrix**: This involves swapping elements such that the element at position (i, j) is swapped with the element at position (n-i-1, j).\n4. **Set all elements divisible by 6 to zero**: Iterate through the matrix and set any element divisible by 6 to zero.\n5. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: Repeat the counterdiagonal mirroring.\n6. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: Repeat the counterdiagonal mirroring again.\n7. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: This involves swapping elements such that the element at position (i, j) is swapped with the element at position (j, i).\n\nLet's implement these steps in Python to get the final matrix.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [9, 4, 1, 5, 3],\n    [7, 9, 2, 1, 4],\n    [7, 3, 8, 6, 6],\n    [2, 5, 4, 7, 1],\n    [6, 1, 8, 7, 9],\n    [1, 8, 9, 7, 4],\n    [5, 9, 0, 8, 5],\n    [6, 6, 2, 5, 6],\n    [1, 7, 1, 9, 0],\n    [0, 3, 7, 6, 4]\n])\n\n# Step 1: Identity transformation (no change)\n# Step 2: Mirror along the counterdiagonal\nmatrix = np.fliplr(np.flipud(matrix.T))\n\n# Step 3: Vertically mirror the matrix\nmatrix = np.flipud(matrix)\n\n# Step 4: Set all elements divisible by 6 to zero\nmatrix[matrix % 6 == 0] = 0\n\n# Step 5: Mirror along the counterdiagonal\nmatrix = np.fliplr(np.flipud(matrix.T))\n\n# Step 6: Mirror along the counterdiagonal\nmatrix = np.fliplr(np.flipud(matrix.T))\n\n# Step 7: Mirror along the diagonal\nmatrix = matrix.T\n\n# Print the final matrix\nfor row in matrix:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the final matrix.",
