    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. The operations are:\n\n1. Identity transformation: This means we do not change the matrix in this step.\n2. Map each occurrence of 7 to 0: This means we need to replace every instance of the number 7 in the matrix with the number 0.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n- Start with the given matrix.\n- Apply the identity transformation, which means the matrix remains unchanged.\n- Replace every occurrence of the number 7 with 0.\n\nThe given matrix is:\n\n```\n8 7\n5 6\n0 2\n2 6\n2 5\n7 0\n```\n\nNow, let's write a Python script to perform these operations and output the final matrix.\n\n```python\n# Define the initial matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [8, 7],\n    [5, 6],\n    [0, 2],\n    [2, 6],\n    [2, 5],\n    [7, 0]\n]\n\n# Perform the operation of mapping 7 to 0\nfor i in range(len(matrix)):\n    for j in range(len(matrix[i])):\n        if matrix[i][j] == 7:\n            matrix[i][j] = 0\n\n# Print the final matrix\nfor row in matrix:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nThis code will replace all occurrences of 7 with 0 and print the final matrix. Let's execute this code to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors. The output matrix after performing the operations is:\n\n```\n8 0\n5 6\n0 2\n2 6\n2 5\n0 0\n```\n\nThis matrix reflects the transformation where each occurrence of the number 7 has been replaced with 0. Now, let's format the final answer as requested:\n\n<<<8 0\n5 6\n0 2\n2 6\n2 5\n0 0>>>"
