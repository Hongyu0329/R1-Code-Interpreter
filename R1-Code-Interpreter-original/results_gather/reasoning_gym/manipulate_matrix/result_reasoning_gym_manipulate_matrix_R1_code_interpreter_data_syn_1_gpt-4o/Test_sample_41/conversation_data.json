    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identity Transformation**: This means we do not change the matrix. The matrix remains the same after this operation.\n\n2. **Mirror the Matrix along the Counterdiagonal**: The counterdiagonal of a matrix is the diagonal that runs from the bottom-left to the top-right. Mirroring along this diagonal involves swapping elements symmetrically across this diagonal.\n\nLet's define the matrix and perform these operations using Python code.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [8, 7, 9],\n    [2, 7, 4],\n    [9, 1, 7],\n    [6, 8, 8],\n    [3, 7, 1],\n    [0, 4, 6]\n])\n\n# Identity transformation (no change)\nidentity_matrix = matrix.copy()\n\n# Mirror along the counterdiagonal\n# For a matrix of size m x n, the counterdiagonal mirroring involves swapping (i, j) with (n-j-1, m-i-1)\n# However, since the matrix is not square, we need to handle it carefully\n# We will create a new matrix with the same dimensions and fill it accordingly\n\nrows, cols = matrix.shape\nmirrored_matrix = np.zeros((cols, rows), dtype=int)\n\nfor i in range(rows):\n    for j in range(cols):\n        mirrored_matrix[j, rows - i - 1] = matrix[i, j]\n\n# Print the final mirrored matrix\nfor row in mirrored_matrix:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nThis code will perform the required operations and print the final matrix after mirroring along the counterdiagonal. Let's execute this code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the matrix after performing the operations. Let's format the final matrix output as required:\n\nThe final matrix after mirroring along the counterdiagonal is:\n```\n0 3 6 9 2 8\n4 7 8 1 7 7\n6 1 8 7 4 9\n```\n\nNow, let's present the final answer in the specified format:\n\n<<<0 3 6 9 2 8\n4 7 8 1 7 7\n6 1 8 7 4 9>>>"
