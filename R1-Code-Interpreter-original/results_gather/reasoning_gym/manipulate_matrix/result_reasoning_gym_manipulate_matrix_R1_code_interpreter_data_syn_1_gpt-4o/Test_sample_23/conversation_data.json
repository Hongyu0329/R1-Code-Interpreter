    "To solve this problem, we need to apply a series of transformations to the given matrix. Let's break down each step and apply the transformations in sequence.\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix.\n\n2. **Crop the matrix to rows 1-3 and columns 3-3 (1-indexed)**: This means we take the submatrix that includes all rows but only the third column.\n\n3. **Map each occurrence of 0 to 7**: Since there are no zeros in the matrix, this step will not change anything.\n\n4. **Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed)**: This means we remove the second row of the current matrix.\n\n5. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: This operation is not applicable to a single column matrix, so it remains unchanged.\n\n6. **Rotate the matrix 360 degrees**: A 360-degree rotation results in no change.\n\n7. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: This operation is not applicable to a single column matrix, so it remains unchanged.\n\n8. **Crop the matrix to rows 1-1 and columns 2-2 (1-indexed)**: This operation is not applicable as the matrix is a single column, and there is no second column.\n\n9. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: Again, this operation is not applicable to a single column matrix.\n\n10. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: This operation is not applicable to a single column matrix.\n\nLet's implement these steps in Python to see the final result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [2, 4, 1, 2, 4],\n    [1, 5, 7, 8, 6],\n    [6, 8, 6, 5, 6]\n])\n\n# Step 2: Crop the matrix to rows 1-3 and columns 3-3 (1-indexed)\nmatrix = matrix[:, 2:3]\n\n# Step 4: Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed)\nmatrix = np.delete(matrix, 1, axis=0)\n\n# Final output\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to see the result.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the matrix after performing the specified operations. The final matrix is:\n\n```\n[[1]\n [6]]\n```\n\nThis matrix is the result of applying all the transformations in sequence. Now, let's format the output as requested:\n\n<<<1\n6>>>"
