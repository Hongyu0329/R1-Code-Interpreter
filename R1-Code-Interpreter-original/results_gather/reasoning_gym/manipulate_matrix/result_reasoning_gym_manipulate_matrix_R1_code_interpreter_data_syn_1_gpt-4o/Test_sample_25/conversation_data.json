    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of transformations on the given matrix. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix.\n2. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: This involves transposing the matrix.\n3. **Remove every 2-nd column (1-indexed)**: This means removing the 2nd, 4th, and 6th columns.\n4. **Map each occurrence of 9 to 2**: Replace all 9s with 2s.\n5. **Map each occurrence of 2 to 6**: Replace all 2s with 6s.\n6. **Map each occurrence of 2 to 6**: This step seems redundant since all 2s have already been replaced with 6s.\n7. **Map each occurrence of 2 to 6**: Again, this step is redundant.\n\nLet's implement these steps in Python to get the final matrix.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [9, 9, 0, 3, 8, 5, 7],\n    [4, 6, 6, 0, 2, 8, 9]\n])\n\n# Step 1: Identity transformation (no change)\n# Step 2: Mirror the matrix along the diagonal (transpose)\nmatrix = matrix.T\n\n# Step 3: Remove every 2-nd column (1-indexed)\nmatrix = np.delete(matrix, [1, 3, 5], axis=1)\n\n# Step 4: Map each occurrence of 9 to 2\nmatrix[matrix == 9] = 2\n\n# Step 5: Map each occurrence of 2 to 6\nmatrix[matrix == 2] = 6\n\n# Step 6 and 7: Redundant steps, already done\n\n# Print the final matrix\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to see the final matrix.",
    "The error indicates that the indices specified for deletion are out of bounds for the current shape of the matrix. This happened because after transposing the matrix, the number of columns became 2, and we attempted to delete columns that don't exist.\n\nLet's correct this by ensuring we delete the correct columns after transposing. The transposed matrix will have 7 rows and 2 columns, so we need to adjust our approach to remove every 2nd column from the original matrix before transposing.\n\nHere's the corrected approach:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: No change.\n2. **Remove every 2-nd column (1-indexed)**: Remove the 2nd, 4th, and 6th columns from the original matrix.\n3. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: Transpose the matrix.\n4. **Map each occurrence of 9 to 2**: Replace all 9s with 2s.\n5. **Map each occurrence of 2 to 6**: Replace all 2s with 6s.\n\nLet's implement these steps in Python:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [9, 9, 0, 3, 8, 5, 7],\n    [4, 6, 6, 0, 2, 8, 9]\n])\n\n# Step 1: Identity transformation (no change)\n# Step 2: Remove every 2-nd column (1-indexed)\nmatrix = np.delete(matrix, [1, 3, 5], axis=1)\n\n# Step 3: Mirror the matrix along the diagonal (transpose)\nmatrix = matrix.T\n\n# Step 4: Map each occurrence of 9 to 2\nmatrix[matrix == 9] = 2\n\n# Step 5: Map each occurrence of 2 to 6\nmatrix[matrix == 2] = 6\n\n# Print the final matrix\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to see the final matrix.",
    "The output matrix is not in the expected format. Let's review the steps and ensure the operations are applied correctly:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: No change.\n2. **Remove every 2-nd column (1-indexed)**: Remove the 2nd, 4th, and 6th columns from the original matrix.\n3. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: Transpose the matrix.\n4. **Map each occurrence of 9 to 2**: Replace all 9s with 2s.\n5. **Map each occurrence of 2 to 6**: Replace all 2s with 6s.\n\nThe operations seem correct, but the final output format needs to be adjusted to match the expected format. Let's ensure the output is formatted correctly and enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [9, 9, 0, 3, 8, 5, 7],\n    [4, 6, 6, 0, 2, 8, 9]\n])\n\n# Step 1: Identity transformation (no change)\n# Step 2: Remove every 2-nd column (1-indexed)\nmatrix = np.delete(matrix, [1, 3, 5], axis=1)\n\n# Step 3: Mirror the matrix along the diagonal (transpose)\nmatrix = matrix.T\n\n# Step 4: Map each occurrence of 9 to 2\nmatrix[matrix == 9] = 2\n\n# Step 5: Map each occurrence of 2 to 6\nmatrix[matrix == 2] = 6\n\n# Format the output\noutput = '\\n'.join(' '.join(map(str, row)) for row in matrix)\nprint(f\"<<<{output}>>>\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to see the final matrix in the correct format.",
