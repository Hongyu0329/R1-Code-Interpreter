    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's break down each step and implement it using Python code.\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix.\n2. **Crop the matrix to rows 5-5 and columns 8-9 (1-indexed)**: This will result in a 1x2 matrix.\n3. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: This will reverse the order of columns in the matrix.\n4. **Crop the matrix to rows 1-1 and columns 1-2 (1-indexed)**: This will result in a 1x2 matrix.\n5. **Remove every 2-nd column (1-indexed)**: This will remove the second column.\n6. **Map each occurrence of 4 to 8**: This will replace all 4s with 8s.\n7. **Rotate the matrix 360 degrees**: This means no change to the matrix.\n8. **Map each occurrence of 9 to 6**: This will replace all 9s with 6s.\n9. **Map each occurrence of 4 to 3**: This will replace all 4s with 3s.\n10. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: This will swap elements across the counterdiagonal.\n\nLet's implement these steps in Python:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [8, 2, 3, 3, 8, 4, 6, 8, 7, 8],\n    [8, 5, 9, 5, 6, 4, 6, 0, 1, 0],\n    [8, 4, 0, 7, 2, 5, 9, 4, 5, 7],\n    [3, 0, 7, 2, 7, 0, 0, 1, 9, 1],\n    [2, 8, 7, 0, 6, 6, 3, 5, 1, 7]\n])\n\n# Step 2: Crop the matrix to rows 5-5 and columns 8-9 (1-indexed)\nmatrix = matrix[4:5, 7:9]\n\n# Step 3: Horizontally mirror the matrix\nmatrix = np.fliplr(matrix)\n\n# Step 4: Crop the matrix to rows 1-1 and columns 1-2 (1-indexed)\nmatrix = matrix[0:1, 0:2]\n\n# Step 5: Remove every 2-nd column (1-indexed)\nmatrix = matrix[:, ::2]\n\n# Step 6: Map each occurrence of 4 to 8\nmatrix[matrix == 4] = 8\n\n# Step 7: Rotate the matrix 360 degrees (no change)\n# No operation needed\n\n# Step 8: Map each occurrence of 9 to 6\nmatrix[matrix == 9] = 6\n\n# Step 9: Map each occurrence of 4 to 3\nmatrix[matrix == 4] = 3\n\n# Step 10: Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal\nmatrix = np.fliplr(np.flipud(matrix.T))\n\n# Print the final matrix\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the final matrix.",
    "The final matrix after performing all the operations is a 1x1 matrix with the value 1. \n\nLet's format the output as requested:\n\n<<<1>>>"
