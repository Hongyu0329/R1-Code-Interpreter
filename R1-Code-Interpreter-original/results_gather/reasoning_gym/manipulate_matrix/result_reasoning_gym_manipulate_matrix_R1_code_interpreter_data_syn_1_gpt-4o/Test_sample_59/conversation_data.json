    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of matrix operations in the specified order. Let's break down each step:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix.\n\n2. **Remove every 2-nd column (1-indexed)**: This involves removing the 2nd and 4th columns from the matrix.\n\n3. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: This operation is equivalent to transposing the matrix.\n\n4. **Rotate the matrix 90 degrees**: This involves rotating the matrix clockwise by 90 degrees.\n\n5. **Remove every 3-th row (1-indexed)**: This involves removing the 3rd row from the matrix.\n\nLet's implement these steps using Python code to transform the matrix accordingly.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [2, 6, 7, 7],\n    [7, 7, 4, 3],\n    [3, 9, 5, 7]\n])\n\n# Step 1: Identity transformation (no change)\n# matrix remains the same\n\n# Step 2: Remove every 2-nd column (1-indexed)\nmatrix = np.delete(matrix, [1, 3], axis=1)\n\n# Step 3: Mirror the matrix along the diagonal (transpose)\nmatrix = matrix.T\n\n# Step 4: Rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\nmatrix = np.rot90(matrix, -1)\n\n# Step 5: Remove every 3-th row (1-indexed)\nmatrix = np.delete(matrix, 2, axis=0)\n\n# Print the final matrix\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the final matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the final matrix after performing all the specified operations is:\n\n```\n[[7 2]\n [4 7]]\n```\n\nNow, let's format the output as requested:\n\n<<<7 2\n4 7>>>"
