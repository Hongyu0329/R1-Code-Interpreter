    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of matrix transformations and operations. Let's break down the steps and implement them using Python.\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix.\n2. **Vertically mirror the matrix**: This involves reversing the order of the rows.\n3. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: This involves reversing the order of the columns in each row.\n4. **Set all elements divisible by 7 to zero**: Iterate through the matrix and set elements divisible by 7 to zero.\n5. **Remove every 6-th row (1-indexed)**: Remove rows at indices 5, 11, 17, etc.\n6. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: Again, reverse the order of the columns in each row.\n7. **Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed)**: Remove rows at indices 1, 3, 5, etc.\n8. **Vertically mirror the matrix**: Reverse the order of the rows again.\n9. **Crop the matrix to rows 1-4 and columns 8-8 (1-indexed)**: Extract a submatrix from the specified range.\n\nLet's implement these steps in Python:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [4, 4, 7, 1, 6, 1, 1, 3, 4],\n    [1, 4, 9, 0, 3, 2, 5, 3, 4],\n    [9, 0, 0, 9, 2, 3, 9, 8, 6],\n    [6, 5, 7, 3, 1, 0, 0, 5, 9],\n    [5, 1, 0, 9, 2, 9, 0, 6, 7],\n    [0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 6, 1, 4],\n    [8, 8, 1, 3, 8, 3, 9, 6, 7],\n    [2, 0, 5, 3, 6, 5, 8, 2, 4],\n    [7, 1, 6, 2, 5, 2, 2, 4, 0]\n])\n\n# Step 2: Vertically mirror the matrix\nmatrix = np.flipud(matrix)\n\n# Step 3: Horizontally mirror the matrix\nmatrix = np.fliplr(matrix)\n\n# Step 4: Set all elements divisible by 7 to zero\nmatrix[matrix % 7 == 0] = 0\n\n# Step 5: Remove every 6-th row (1-indexed)\nmatrix = np.delete(matrix, np.arange(5, matrix.shape[0], 6), axis=0)\n\n# Step 6: Horizontally mirror the matrix\nmatrix = np.fliplr(matrix)\n\n# Step 7: Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed)\nmatrix = np.delete(matrix, np.arange(1, matrix.shape[0], 2), axis=0)\n\n# Step 8: Vertically mirror the matrix\nmatrix = np.flipud(matrix)\n\n# Step 9: Crop the matrix to rows 1-4 and columns 8-8 (1-indexed)\nfinal_matrix = matrix[:4, 7:8]\n\n# Output the final matrix\nprint(final_matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will execute the series of operations on the matrix and output the final result. Let's see the output.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the final matrix after performing all the specified operations is:\n\n```\n[[3]\n [6]\n [6]\n [4]]\n```\n\nNow, let's format the output as requested:\n\n<<<3\n6\n6\n4>>>"
