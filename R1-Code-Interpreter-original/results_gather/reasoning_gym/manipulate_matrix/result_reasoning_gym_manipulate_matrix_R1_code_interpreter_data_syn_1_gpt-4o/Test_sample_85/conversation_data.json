    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of matrix transformations on the given matrix. Let's break down each step:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix.\n2. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: The counterdiagonal of a matrix is the diagonal from the top-right to the bottom-left. Mirroring along this diagonal involves swapping elements symmetrically across this line.\n3. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: This involves flipping the matrix over its horizontal center line.\n4. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: Repeat the counterdiagonal mirroring.\n5. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: Repeat the horizontal mirroring.\n6. **Crop the matrix to rows 2-5 and columns 4-4 (1-indexed)**: This means we only keep the elements from the 2nd to the 5th row and the 4th column.\n7. **Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed)**: This means removing the 2nd and 4th rows from the cropped matrix.\n8. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: This involves swapping elements symmetrically across the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right).\n\nLet's implement these steps in Python to get the final matrix.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [2, 3, 6, 2],\n    [8, 6, 1, 8],\n    [9, 5, 5, 7],\n    [0, 2, 5, 6],\n    [1, 2, 6, 6]\n])\n\n# Step 1: Identity transformation (no change)\n# Step 2: Mirror along the counterdiagonal\nmatrix = np.fliplr(matrix).T\n\n# Step 3: Horizontally mirror the matrix\nmatrix = np.flipud(matrix)\n\n# Step 4: Mirror along the counterdiagonal again\nmatrix = np.fliplr(matrix).T\n\n# Step 5: Horizontally mirror the matrix again\nmatrix = np.flipud(matrix)\n\n# Step 6: Crop to rows 2-5 and columns 4-4 (1-indexed)\nmatrix = matrix[1:5, 3:4]\n\n# Step 7: Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed)\nmatrix = np.delete(matrix, [1, 3], axis=0)\n\n# Step 8: Mirror along the diagonal\nmatrix = matrix.T\n\n# Print the final matrix\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the final matrix.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the final matrix after performing all the specified operations. The final matrix is:\n\n```\n[[8 6]]\n```\n\nNow, let's format this result according to the required output format:\n\n<<<8 6>>>"
