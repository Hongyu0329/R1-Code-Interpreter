    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of matrix transformations step by step. Let's break down each operation and implement it using Python:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix.\n2. **Remove every 6-th column**: We will remove the 6th column from the matrix.\n3. **Rotate the matrix 270 degrees**: This is equivalent to rotating the matrix 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n4. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: This means reversing each row.\n5. **Set all elements divisible by 4 to zero**: We will iterate through the matrix and set elements divisible by 4 to zero.\n6. **Vertically mirror the matrix**: This means reversing the order of the rows.\n7. **Vertically mirror the matrix**: This operation will cancel out the previous vertical mirror, so the matrix remains unchanged.\n8. **Rotate the matrix 90 degrees**: This is a standard 90-degree clockwise rotation.\n\nLet's implement these steps in Python:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [8, 4, 2, 2, 4, 2, 0, 6, 7],\n    [9, 1, 3, 4, 8, 2, 1, 7, 1],\n    [5, 5, 7, 1, 7, 2, 0, 3, 5],\n    [4, 0, 8, 5, 8, 7, 6, 6, 4]\n])\n\n# Step 2: Remove every 6-th column (1-indexed)\nmatrix = np.delete(matrix, 5, axis=1)\n\n# Step 3: Rotate the matrix 270 degrees (90 degrees counterclockwise)\nmatrix = np.rot90(matrix, k=1)\n\n# Step 4: Horizontally mirror the matrix\nmatrix = np.fliplr(matrix)\n\n# Step 5: Set all elements divisible by 4 to zero\nmatrix[matrix % 4 == 0] = 0\n\n# Step 6: Vertically mirror the matrix\nmatrix = np.flipud(matrix)\n\n# Step 7: Vertically mirror the matrix (cancels out the previous step)\nmatrix = np.flipud(matrix)\n\n# Step 8: Rotate the matrix 90 degrees (clockwise)\nmatrix = np.rot90(matrix, k=-1)\n\n# Print the final matrix\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the final matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the final matrix after performing all the operations is:\n\n```\n[[0 0 0 5 0 6 6 0]\n [5 5 7 1 7 0 3 5]\n [9 1 3 0 0 1 7 1]\n [0 0 2 2 0 0 6 7]]\n```\n\nNow, let's format this matrix according to the required output format:\n\n<<<0 0 0 5 0 6 6 0\n5 5 7 1 7 0 3 5\n9 1 3 0 0 1 7 1\n0 0 2 2 0 0 6 7>>>"
