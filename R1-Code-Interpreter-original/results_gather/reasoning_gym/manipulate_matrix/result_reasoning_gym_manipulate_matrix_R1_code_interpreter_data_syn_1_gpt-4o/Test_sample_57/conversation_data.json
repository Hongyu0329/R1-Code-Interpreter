    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of matrix transformations step by step. Let's break down each operation and apply it to the given matrix:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix.\n   \\[\n   \\begin{bmatrix}\n   2 & 5 & 1 & 2 & 6 & 5 \\\\\n   3 & 4 & 5 & 1 & 9 & 2 \\\\\n   7 & 9 & 0 & 3 & 2 & 9 \\\\\n   \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed)**: Remove the second row.\n   \\[\n   \\begin{bmatrix}\n   2 & 5 & 1 & 2 & 6 & 5 \\\\\n   7 & 9 & 0 & 3 & 2 & 9 \\\\\n   \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Map each occurrence of 1 to 9**: Replace 1 with 9.\n   \\[\n   \\begin{bmatrix}\n   2 & 5 & 9 & 2 & 6 & 5 \\\\\n   7 & 9 & 0 & 3 & 2 & 9 \\\\\n   \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: Swap elements across the counterdiagonal.\n   \\[\n   \\begin{bmatrix}\n   9 & 2 \\\\\n   5 & 6 \\\\\n   2 & 3 \\\\\n   9 & 0 \\\\\n   5 & 2 \\\\\n   2 & 7 \\\\\n   \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Rotate the matrix 270 degrees**: Rotate the matrix 270 degrees clockwise.\n   \\[\n   \\begin{bmatrix}\n   2 & 5 & 9 & 2 & 5 & 9 \\\\\n   7 & 2 & 0 & 3 & 6 & 2 \\\\\n   \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Crop the matrix to rows 1-1 and columns 1-2 (1-indexed)**: Select the first row and first two columns.\n   \\[\n   \\begin{bmatrix}\n   2 & 5 \\\\\n   \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n7. **Map each occurrence of 1 to 2**: There are no 1s to map to 2.\n\n8. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: Swap elements across the diagonal.\n   \\[\n   \\begin{bmatrix}\n   2 \\\\\n   5 \\\\\n   \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n\n9. **Crop the matrix to rows 2-2 and columns 1-1 (1-indexed)**: Select the second row and first column.\n   \\[\n   \\begin{bmatrix}\n   5 \\\\\n   \\end{bmatrix}\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python to ensure the operations are correctly applied.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [2, 5, 1, 2, 6, 5],\n    [3, 4, 5, 1, 9, 2],\n    [7, 9, 0, 3, 2, 9]\n])\n\n# Step 2: Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed)\nmatrix = np.delete(matrix, 1, axis=0)\n\n# Step 3: Map each occurrence of 1 to 9\nmatrix[matrix == 1] = 9\n\n# Step 4: Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal\nmatrix = np.fliplr(matrix).T\n\n# Step 5: Rotate the matrix 270 degrees\nmatrix = np.rot90(matrix, k=3)\n\n# Step 6: Crop the matrix to rows 1-1 and columns 1-2 (1-indexed)\nmatrix = matrix[0:1, 0:2]\n\n# Step 7: Map each occurrence of 1 to 2 (no 1s present)\n\n# Step 8: Mirror the matrix along the diagonal\nmatrix = matrix.T\n\n# Step 9: Crop the matrix to rows 2-2 and columns 1-1 (1-indexed)\nmatrix = matrix[1:2, 0:1]\n\n# Output the final matrix\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the final matrix.",
