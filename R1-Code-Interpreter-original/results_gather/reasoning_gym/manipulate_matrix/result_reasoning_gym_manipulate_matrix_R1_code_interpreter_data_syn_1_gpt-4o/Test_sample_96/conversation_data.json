    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of matrix transformations and operations in the specified order. Let's break down each step and implement the necessary transformations using Python.\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: No change to the matrix.\n2. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: Swap elements across the counterdiagonal.\n3. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: This will revert the matrix to its original form.\n4. **Map each occurrence of 5 to 6**: Replace all 5s with 6s.\n5. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: Swap elements across the main diagonal.\n6. **Remove every 5-th row (1-indexed)**: Remove the 5th row.\n7. **Crop the matrix to rows 4-4 and columns 4-5 (1-indexed)**: Extract a submatrix.\n8. **Map each occurrence of 5 to 7**: Replace all 5s with 7s.\n9. **Crop the matrix to rows 1-1 and columns 1-2 (1-indexed)**: Extract a submatrix.\n10. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: Reverse each row.\n11. **Rotate the matrix 90 degrees**: Rotate the matrix clockwise.\n\nLet's implement these steps in Python:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [8, 5, 2, 7, 0, 2, 5, 8],\n    [4, 9, 8, 4, 1, 1, 0, 4],\n    [5, 1, 7, 2, 6, 8, 5, 7],\n    [5, 7, 5, 8, 5, 6, 4, 4],\n    [3, 9, 0, 2, 9, 2, 1, 1]\n])\n\n# Step 1: Identity transformation (no change)\n\n# Step 2: Mirror along the counterdiagonal\nmatrix = np.fliplr(np.flipud(matrix.T))\n\n# Step 3: Mirror along the counterdiagonal again (revert to original)\nmatrix = np.fliplr(np.flipud(matrix.T))\n\n# Step 4: Map each occurrence of 5 to 6\nmatrix[matrix == 5] = 6\n\n# Step 5: Mirror along the diagonal\nmatrix = matrix.T\n\n# Step 6: Remove every 5-th row (1-indexed)\nmatrix = np.delete(matrix, 4, axis=0)\n\n# Step 7: Crop to rows 4-4 and columns 4-5 (1-indexed)\nmatrix = matrix[3:4, 3:5]\n\n# Step 8: Map each occurrence of 5 to 7\nmatrix[matrix == 5] = 7\n\n# Step 9: Crop to rows 1-1 and columns 1-2 (1-indexed)\nmatrix = matrix[0:1, 0:2]\n\n# Step 10: Horizontally mirror the matrix\nmatrix = np.fliplr(matrix)\n\n# Step 11: Rotate the matrix 90 degrees\nmatrix = np.rot90(matrix, -1)\n\n# Print the final matrix\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will execute the series of operations and output the final matrix. Let's see the result.",
