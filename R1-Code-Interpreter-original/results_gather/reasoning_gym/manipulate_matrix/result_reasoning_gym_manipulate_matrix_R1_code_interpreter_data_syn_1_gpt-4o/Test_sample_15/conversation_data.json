    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's break down each step and implement them in Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix.\n2. **Vertically mirror the matrix**: This involves reversing the order of the rows.\n3. **Map each occurrence of 5 to 7**: Replace all 5s with 7s.\n4. **Remove every 2-nd column (1-indexed)**: This means removing the second column from the matrix.\n5. **Map each occurrence of 5 to 9**: Since we already replaced 5s with 7s, this step will not affect the matrix.\n6. **Map each occurrence of 3 to 9**: There are no 3s in the matrix, so this step will not affect the matrix.\n7. **Crop the matrix to rows 6-6 and columns 1-2 (1-indexed)**: This means we only take the 6th row and the first two columns.\n8. **Rotate the matrix 360 degrees**: A 360-degree rotation results in the same matrix.\n\nLet's implement these steps in Python:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [6, 8, 7],\n    [9, 5, 4],\n    [8, 6, 6],\n    [9, 0, 6],\n    [0, 1, 0],\n    [4, 7, 8],\n    [0, 5, 9]\n])\n\n# Step 2: Vertically mirror the matrix\nmatrix = np.flipud(matrix)\n\n# Step 3: Map each occurrence of 5 to 7\nmatrix[matrix == 5] = 7\n\n# Step 4: Remove every 2-nd column (1-indexed)\nmatrix = np.delete(matrix, 1, axis=1)\n\n# Step 5: Map each occurrence of 5 to 9 (no effect as there are no 5s)\n# Step 6: Map each occurrence of 3 to 9 (no effect as there are no 3s)\n\n# Step 7: Crop the matrix to rows 6-6 and columns 1-2 (1-indexed)\nmatrix = matrix[5:6, 0:2]\n\n# Step 8: Rotate the matrix 360 degrees (no change)\n# Final matrix\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the final matrix.",
    "The code execution has provided the final matrix after performing all the specified operations. The final matrix is:\n\n```\n[[9 4]]\n```\n\nThis matrix is the result of cropping the original matrix to the 6th row and the first two columns after performing all the transformations. \n\nNow, let's format the final answer as requested:\n\n<<<9 4>>>"
