    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's break down each step:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix.\n2. **Set all elements divisible by 5 to zero**: We will iterate through the matrix and set any element divisible by 5 to zero.\n3. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: This involves transposing the matrix.\n4. **Rotate the matrix 270 degrees**: This is equivalent to rotating the matrix 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n5. **Remove every 2-nd column (1-indexed)**: This means removing the second column.\n6. **Remove every 2-nd column (1-indexed)**: This means removing the second column again after the previous removal.\n\nLet's implement these steps in Python:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = np.array([[0, 0, 4],\n                   [3, 6, 3]])\n\n# Step 2: Set all elements divisible by 5 to zero\nmatrix[matrix % 5 == 0] = 0\n\n# Step 3: Mirror the matrix along the diagonal (transpose)\nmatrix = matrix.T\n\n# Step 4: Rotate the matrix 270 degrees (90 degrees counterclockwise)\nmatrix = np.rot90(matrix, k=1)\n\n# Step 5: Remove every 2-nd column (1-indexed)\nmatrix = np.delete(matrix, 1, axis=1)\n\n# Step 6: Remove every 2-nd column (1-indexed) again\nmatrix = np.delete(matrix, 1, axis=1)\n\n# Print the final matrix\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to see the final matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the final matrix after performing all the specified operations is:\n\n```\n[[3]\n [0]]\n```\n\nNow, let's format the output as requested:\n\n<<<3\n0>>>"
