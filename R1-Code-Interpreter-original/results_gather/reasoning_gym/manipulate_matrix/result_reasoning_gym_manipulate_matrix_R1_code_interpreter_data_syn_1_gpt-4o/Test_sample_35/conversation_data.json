    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identity Transformation**: This means we do nothing to the matrix initially.\n\n2. **Set all elements divisible by 3 to zero**: We will iterate through each element of the matrix and set it to zero if it is divisible by 3.\n\n3. **Vertically Mirror the Matrix**: This operation involves flipping the matrix along its vertical axis. For a 3x3 matrix, this means swapping the first column with the last column.\n\n4. **Horizontally Mirror the Matrix**: This operation involves flipping the matrix along its horizontal axis. For a 3x3 matrix, this means swapping the first row with the last row.\n\n5. **Horizontally Mirror the Matrix Again**: This is the same operation as the previous step, so we will swap the first row with the last row again.\n\nLet's implement these steps in Python to get the final matrix.\n\n```python\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [6, 7, 6],\n    [4, 9, 6],\n    [7, 9, 4]\n]\n\n# Step 2: Set all elements divisible by 3 to zero\nfor i in range(len(matrix)):\n    for j in range(len(matrix[i])):\n        if matrix[i][j] % 3 == 0:\n            matrix[i][j] = 0\n\n# Step 3: Vertically mirror the matrix\nfor i in range(len(matrix)):\n    matrix[i][0], matrix[i][2] = matrix[i][2], matrix[i][0]\n\n# Step 4: Horizontally mirror the matrix\nmatrix[0], matrix[2] = matrix[2], matrix[0]\n\n# Step 5: Horizontally mirror the matrix again\nmatrix[0], matrix[2] = matrix[2], matrix[0]\n\n# Print the final matrix\nfor row in matrix:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nThis code will execute the series of operations on the matrix and print the final result. Let's see the output.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matrix is:\n\n```\n0 7 0\n0 0 4\n4 0 7\n```\n\nNow, let's format the final matrix output as requested:\n\n<<<0 7 0\n0 0 4\n4 0 7>>>"
