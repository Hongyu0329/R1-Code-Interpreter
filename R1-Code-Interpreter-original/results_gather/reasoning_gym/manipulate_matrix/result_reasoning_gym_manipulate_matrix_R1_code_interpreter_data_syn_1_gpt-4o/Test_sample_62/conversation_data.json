    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of matrix transformations and modifications. Let's break down the steps and implement them using Python:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix.\n2. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: This involves transposing the matrix.\n3. **Vertically mirror the matrix**: This involves reversing the order of the rows.\n4. **Rotate the matrix 180 degrees**: This involves reversing the order of both rows and columns.\n5. **Set all elements divisible by 8 to zero**: This involves iterating through the matrix and setting elements divisible by 8 to zero.\n6. **Map each occurrence of 3 to 7**: This involves replacing all 3s with 7s.\n7. **Rotate the matrix 180 degrees**: Again, reverse the order of both rows and columns.\n8. **Map each occurrence of 8 to 1**: Replace all 8s with 1s.\n9. **Set all elements divisible by 5 to zero**: Set elements divisible by 5 to zero.\n\nLet's implement these steps in Python:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [1, 4, 4, 6],\n    [0, 7, 5, 4],\n    [6, 9, 4, 8],\n    [0, 6, 0, 6],\n    [5, 7, 5, 3],\n    [0, 6, 7, 2],\n    [4, 2, 1, 4],\n    [7, 4, 1, 5],\n    [6, 5, 0, 8],\n    [0, 4, 3, 0]\n])\n\n# Step 1: Identity transformation (no change)\n# Step 2: Mirror the matrix along the diagonal (transpose)\nmatrix = matrix.T\n\n# Step 3: Vertically mirror the matrix (reverse rows)\nmatrix = matrix[::-1]\n\n# Step 4: Rotate the matrix 180 degrees (reverse both rows and columns)\nmatrix = matrix[::-1, ::-1]\n\n# Step 5: Set all elements divisible by 8 to zero\nmatrix[matrix % 8 == 0] = 0\n\n# Step 6: Map each occurrence of 3 to 7\nmatrix[matrix == 3] = 7\n\n# Step 7: Rotate the matrix 180 degrees (reverse both rows and columns)\nmatrix = matrix[::-1, ::-1]\n\n# Step 8: Map each occurrence of 8 to 1\nmatrix[matrix == 8] = 1\n\n# Step 9: Set all elements divisible by 5 to zero\nmatrix[matrix % 5 == 0] = 0\n\n# Print the final matrix\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the final matrix.",
