    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's break down each step:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix.\n2. **Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed)**: This means we remove the 2nd and 4th rows.\n3. **Remove every 3-th row (1-indexed)**: After removing the 2nd and 4th rows, we need to remove the 3rd row of the remaining matrix.\n4. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: This means reversing each row.\n5. **Vertically mirror the matrix**: This means reversing the order of the rows.\n6. **Rotate the matrix 360 degrees**: This means the matrix remains unchanged.\n\nLet's implement these steps in Python to get the final matrix.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [7, 4, 2, 6, 8, 1, 4, 4],\n    [9, 0, 4, 5, 3, 2, 9, 3],\n    [2, 8, 2, 3, 5, 1, 1, 2],\n    [1, 7, 3, 2, 7, 4, 1, 3],\n    [4, 6, 6, 3, 1, 9, 4, 6]\n])\n\n# Step 2: Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed)\nmatrix = np.delete(matrix, [1, 3], axis=0)\n\n# Step 3: Remove every 3-th row (1-indexed)\nmatrix = np.delete(matrix, [2], axis=0)\n\n# Step 4: Horizontally mirror the matrix\nmatrix = np.fliplr(matrix)\n\n# Step 5: Vertically mirror the matrix\nmatrix = np.flipud(matrix)\n\n# Step 6: Rotate the matrix 360 degrees (no change)\n# No operation needed as 360-degree rotation results in the same matrix\n\n# Print the final matrix\nfor row in matrix:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to get the final matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the final matrix after performing all the operations is:\n\n```\n2 1 1 5 3 2 8 2\n4 4 1 8 6 2 4 7\n```\n\nNow, let's format the final answer as requested:\n\n<<<2 1 1 5 3 2 8 2\n4 4 1 8 6 2 4 7>>>"
