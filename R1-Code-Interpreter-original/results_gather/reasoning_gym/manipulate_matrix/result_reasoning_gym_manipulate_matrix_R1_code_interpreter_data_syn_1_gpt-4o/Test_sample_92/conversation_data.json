    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identity Transformation**: This means we do not change the matrix at all. We simply take the matrix as it is.\n\n2. **Map each occurrence of 0 to 9**: We will iterate through the matrix and replace every 0 with a 9.\n\n3. **Vertically Mirror the Matrix**: This involves flipping the matrix along its vertical axis. For example, the first column becomes the last column, the second column becomes the second last column, and so on.\n\nLet's implement these steps using Python code to transform the matrix accordingly.\n\n```python\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [0, 2, 0, 6, 4, 5, 0, 5, 2, 6],\n    [4, 6, 0, 8, 7, 9, 6, 0, 3, 3],\n    [1, 6, 5, 3, 2, 6, 3, 5, 8, 4],\n    [6, 2, 1, 7, 8, 9, 1, 6, 9, 8],\n    [7, 1, 9, 7, 1, 2, 8, 6, 3, 2],\n    [7, 8, 0, 7, 6, 5, 9, 7, 1, 2]\n]\n\n# Step 2: Map each occurrence of 0 to 9\nfor i in range(len(matrix)):\n    for j in range(len(matrix[i])):\n        if matrix[i][j] == 0:\n            matrix[i][j] = 9\n\n# Step 3: Vertically mirror the matrix\nfor i in range(len(matrix)):\n    matrix[i] = matrix[i][::-1]\n\n# Print the final matrix\nfor row in matrix:\n    print(\" \".join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nThis code will transform the matrix according to the specified operations. Let's execute it to get the final result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the final transformed matrix. Let's format the output to match the required format, ensuring it is enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final matrix after performing all the operations is:\n\n<<<\n6 2 5 9 5 4 6 9 2 9\n3 3 9 6 9 7 8 9 6 4\n4 8 5 3 6 2 3 5 6 1\n8 9 6 1 9 8 7 1 2 6\n2 3 6 8 2 1 7 9 1 7\n2 1 7 9 5 6 7 9 8 7\n>>>"
