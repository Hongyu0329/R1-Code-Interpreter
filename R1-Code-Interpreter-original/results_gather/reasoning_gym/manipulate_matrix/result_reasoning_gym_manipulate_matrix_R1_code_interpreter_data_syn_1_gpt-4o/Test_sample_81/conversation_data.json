    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of matrix transformations and modifications. Let's break down each step and implement them using Python:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix.\n2. **Remove every 4-th column (1-indexed)**: We will remove the 4th column from the matrix.\n3. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: This involves swapping elements across the counterdiagonal.\n4. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: This involves swapping elements across the main diagonal.\n5. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: Repeat the counterdiagonal mirroring.\n6. **Remove every 2-nd column (1-indexed)**: We will remove the 2nd column from the matrix.\n7. **Map each occurrence of 2 to 3**: Replace all 2s with 3s.\n8. **Set all elements divisible by 8 to zero**: Replace elements divisible by 8 with 0.\n9. **Set all elements divisible by 3 to zero**: Replace elements divisible by 3 with 0.\n\nLet's implement these steps in Python:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [0, 7, 8, 5, 3, 6],\n    [0, 1, 4, 2, 9, 4]\n])\n\n# Step 2: Remove every 4-th column (1-indexed)\nmatrix = np.delete(matrix, 3, axis=1)\n\n# Step 3: Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal\nmatrix = np.fliplr(np.flipud(matrix.T))\n\n# Step 4: Mirror the matrix along the diagonal\nmatrix = matrix.T\n\n# Step 5: Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal\nmatrix = np.fliplr(np.flipud(matrix.T))\n\n# Step 6: Remove every 2-nd column (1-indexed)\nmatrix = np.delete(matrix, 1, axis=1)\n\n# Step 7: Map each occurrence of 2 to 3\nmatrix[matrix == 2] = 3\n\n# Step 8: Set all elements divisible by 8 to zero\nmatrix[matrix % 8 == 0] = 0\n\n# Step 9: Set all elements divisible by 3 to zero\nmatrix[matrix % 3 == 0] = 0\n\n# Print the final matrix\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the final matrix.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the final matrix after performing all the specified operations. Let's format the output to match the required format:\n\nThe final matrix is:\n```\n0\n7\n0\n0\n0\n```\n\nNow, let's format it as requested:\n\n<<<0\n7\n0\n0\n0>>>"
