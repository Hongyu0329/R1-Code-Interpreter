    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of transformations on the given matrix. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identity Transformation**: This step involves no change to the matrix.\n\n2. **Horizontally Mirror the Matrix**: This means reversing each row of the matrix.\n\n3. **Remove Every 3rd Column (1-indexed)**: We need to remove columns indexed as 3, 6, 9, etc. (1-indexed), which correspond to columns 2, 5, 8, etc. (0-indexed).\n\n4. **Map Each Occurrence of 3 to 5**: Replace every occurrence of the number 3 in the matrix with 5.\n\n5. **Rotate the Matrix 180 Degrees**: This involves flipping the matrix upside down and then reversing each row.\n\nLet's implement these steps in Python to get the final matrix.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [5, 0, 9, 0, 8, 0, 0, 4],\n    [5, 0, 1, 7, 7, 1, 5, 3],\n    [4, 2, 4, 6, 8, 3, 2, 1],\n    [3, 9, 8, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1],\n    [8, 8, 4, 9, 1, 0, 7, 1]\n])\n\n# Step 2: Horizontally mirror the matrix\nmatrix = np.fliplr(matrix)\n\n# Step 3: Remove every 3rd column (1-indexed)\nmatrix = np.delete(matrix, np.arange(2, matrix.shape[1], 3), axis=1)\n\n# Step 4: Map each occurrence of 3 to 5\nmatrix[matrix == 3] = 5\n\n# Step 5: Rotate the matrix 180 degrees\nmatrix = np.rot90(matrix, 2)\n\n# Print the final matrix\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will execute the transformations and provide the final matrix. Let's see the output.",
    "The code executed successfully, and we have the final matrix after performing all the specified operations. The matrix is formatted as follows:\n\n```\n8 8 9 1 7 1\n5 9 2 1 1 1\n4 2 6 8 2 1\n5 0 7 7 5 5\n5 0 0 8 0 4\n```\n\nNow, let's format this matrix according to the required output format.\n\n<<<\n8 8 9 1 7 1\n5 9 2 1 1 1\n4 2 6 8 2 1\n5 0 7 7 5 5\n5 0 0 8 0 4\n>>>"
