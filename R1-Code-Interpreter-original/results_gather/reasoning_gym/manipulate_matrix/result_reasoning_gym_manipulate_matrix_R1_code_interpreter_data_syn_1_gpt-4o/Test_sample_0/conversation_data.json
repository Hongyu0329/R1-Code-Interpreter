    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identity Transformation**: This means we do not change the matrix at all. The matrix remains the same after this step.\n\n2. **Map each occurrence of 2 to 8**: We need to iterate through the matrix and replace every occurrence of the number 2 with the number 8.\n\nLet's write a Python script to perform these operations on the matrix.\n\n```python\n# Define the initial matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [2, 4, 3, 7, 0],\n    [0, 1, 5, 8, 5],\n    [0, 8, 7, 5, 9]\n]\n\n# Perform the mapping of 2 to 8\nfor i in range(len(matrix)):\n    for j in range(len(matrix[i])):\n        if matrix[i][j] == 2:\n            matrix[i][j] = 8\n\n# Print the final matrix\nfor row in matrix:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nThis script will output the final matrix after performing the specified operations. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the output matches the expected result after performing the specified operations on the matrix. The matrix was transformed by replacing each occurrence of the number 2 with the number 8.\n\nNow, let's format the final matrix output as requested:\n\n<<<8 4 3 7 0\n0 1 5 8 5\n0 8 7 5 9>>>"
