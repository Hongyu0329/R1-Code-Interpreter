    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of matrix operations in the specified order. Let's break down each step and implement it using Python code.\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This step does nothing to the matrix.\n2. **Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed)**: This means we remove the 2nd and 4th rows.\n3. **Map each occurrence of 5 to 9**: Replace all 5s with 9s.\n4. **Crop the matrix to rows 2-2 and columns 1-4 (1-indexed)**: This means we take only the second row and the first four columns.\n5. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: Reverse the order of columns in each row.\n6. **Set all elements divisible by 1 to zero**: This effectively sets all elements to zero.\n7. **Remove every 3-th column (1-indexed)**: This means removing the 3rd column.\n8. **Rotate the matrix 90 degrees**: Transpose and then reverse each row.\n9. **Rotate the matrix 180 degrees**: Reverse both rows and columns.\n10. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: Transpose the matrix.\n11. **Crop the matrix to rows 1-1 and columns 1-2 (1-indexed)**: This means taking the first row and the first two columns.\n\nLet's implement these steps in Python:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [1, 5, 4, 0, 4, 5],\n    [0, 9, 7, 8, 9, 5],\n    [9, 8, 2, 9, 8, 0],\n    [3, 9, 2, 6, 4, 1]\n])\n\n# Step 2: Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed)\nmatrix = np.delete(matrix, [1, 3], axis=0)\n\n# Step 3: Map each occurrence of 5 to 9\nmatrix[matrix == 5] = 9\n\n# Step 4: Crop the matrix to rows 2-2 and columns 1-4 (1-indexed)\nmatrix = matrix[1:2, 0:4]\n\n# Step 5: Horizontally mirror the matrix\nmatrix = np.fliplr(matrix)\n\n# Step 6: Set all elements divisible by 1 to zero\nmatrix = np.zeros_like(matrix)\n\n# Step 7: Remove every 3-th column (1-indexed)\nmatrix = np.delete(matrix, [2], axis=1)\n\n# Step 8: Rotate the matrix 90 degrees\nmatrix = np.rot90(matrix, k=1)\n\n# Step 9: Rotate the matrix 180 degrees\nmatrix = np.rot90(matrix, k=2)\n\n# Step 10: Mirror the matrix along the diagonal\nmatrix = matrix.T\n\n# Step 11: Crop the matrix to rows 1-1 and columns 1-2 (1-indexed)\nmatrix = matrix[0:1, 0:2]\n\n# Print the final matrix\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the final matrix.",
