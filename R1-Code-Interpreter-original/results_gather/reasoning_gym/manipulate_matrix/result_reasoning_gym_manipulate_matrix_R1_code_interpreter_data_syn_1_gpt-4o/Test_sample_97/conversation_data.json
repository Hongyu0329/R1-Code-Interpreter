    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of matrix transformations step by step. Let's break down each operation and implement it using Python:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix.\n2. **Remove every 5-th row (1-indexed)**: This involves removing the 5th and 10th rows.\n3. **Rotate the matrix 180 degrees**: This can be achieved by reversing the order of rows and then reversing each row.\n4. **Vertically mirror the matrix**: This involves reversing the order of columns in each row.\n5. **Remove every 3-th column (1-indexed)**: This involves removing the 3rd and 6th columns.\n6. **Map each occurrence of 1 to 6**: Replace all occurrences of the number 1 with 6.\n7. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: This involves reversing the order of columns in each row.\n8. **Horizontally mirror the matrix again**: This will revert the previous horizontal mirror, effectively making no change.\n\nLet's implement these steps in Python:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [0, 6, 3, 5, 3, 1],\n    [8, 2, 2, 4, 9, 3],\n    [2, 7, 9, 7, 2, 1],\n    [4, 1, 4, 1, 6, 0],\n    [3, 9, 2, 1, 3, 7],\n    [0, 4, 9, 4, 5, 2],\n    [5, 7, 8, 9, 1, 8],\n    [2, 3, 2, 8, 7, 2],\n    [9, 5, 4, 9, 5, 9],\n    [7, 5, 5, 2, 8, 2]\n])\n\n# Step 2: Remove every 5-th row\nmatrix = np.delete(matrix, [4, 9], axis=0)\n\n# Step 3: Rotate the matrix 180 degrees\nmatrix = np.rot90(matrix, 2)\n\n# Step 4: Vertically mirror the matrix\nmatrix = np.fliplr(matrix)\n\n# Step 5: Remove every 3-th column\nmatrix = np.delete(matrix, [2, 5], axis=1)\n\n# Step 6: Map each occurrence of 1 to 6\nmatrix[matrix == 1] = 6\n\n# Step 7: Horizontally mirror the matrix\nmatrix = np.fliplr(matrix)\n\n# Step 8: Horizontally mirror the matrix again (no change)\nmatrix = np.fliplr(matrix)\n\n# Print the final matrix\nfor row in matrix:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nThis code will execute the series of operations on the matrix and print the final result. Let's see the output.",
