# Step 7: Crop the matrix to rows 1-2 and columns 3-3 (1-indexed)
# This results in an empty matrix as there is only 1 column

# Step 8: Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed) - no effect as the matrix is empty
# Step 9: Map each occurrence of 8 to 1 - no effect as the matrix is empty
# Step 10: Map each occurrence of 5 to 4 - no effect as the matrix is empty
# Step 11: Crop the matrix to rows 1-1 and columns 1-1 (1-indexed) - no effect as the matrix is empty
