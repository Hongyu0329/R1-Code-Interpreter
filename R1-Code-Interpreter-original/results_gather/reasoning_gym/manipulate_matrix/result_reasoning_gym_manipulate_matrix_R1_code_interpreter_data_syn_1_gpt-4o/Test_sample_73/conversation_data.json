    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of matrix operations step by step. Let's break down each operation and apply it to the given matrix.\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix.\n\n2. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: This operation involves transposing the matrix, which means converting rows to columns and vice versa.\n\n3. **Remove every 6-th column (1-indexed)**: Since the matrix has only 3 columns, this operation does not affect the matrix.\n\n4. **Remove every 2-nd column (1-indexed)**: This operation will remove the second column from the matrix.\n\n5. **Remove every 2-nd column (1-indexed)**: After the previous step, the matrix will have only one column left, so this operation will not affect the matrix.\n\n6. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: This operation will transpose the matrix again, but since it has only one column, it will remain unchanged.\n\n7. **Crop the matrix to rows 1-2 and columns 3-3 (1-indexed)**: This operation will select a specific part of the matrix, but since we have only one column, it will result in an empty matrix.\n\n8. **Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed)**: This operation will not affect the matrix as it is already empty.\n\n9. **Map each occurrence of 8 to 1**: This operation will not affect the matrix as it is already empty.\n\n10. **Map each occurrence of 5 to 4**: This operation will not affect the matrix as it is already empty.\n\n11. **Crop the matrix to rows 1-1 and columns 1-1 (1-indexed)**: This operation will not affect the matrix as it is already empty.\n\nLet's implement these operations in Python to verify the final result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [0, 4, 8],\n    [9, 5, 4],\n    [2, 5, 2],\n    [2, 1, 6],\n    [5, 2, 6],\n    [9, 6, 7],\n    [7, 3, 2]\n])\n\n# Step 1: Identity transformation (no change)\n# Step 2: Mirror the matrix along the diagonal (transpose)\nmatrix = matrix.T\n\n# Step 3: Remove every 6-th column (1-indexed) - no effect as there are only 3 columns\n# Step 4: Remove every 2-nd column (1-indexed)\nmatrix = np.delete(matrix, 1, axis=1)\n\n# Step 5: Remove every 2-nd column (1-indexed) - no effect as there is only 1 column\n# Step 6: Mirror the matrix along the diagonal (transpose)\nmatrix = matrix.T\n\n# Step 7: Crop the matrix to rows 1-2 and columns 3-3 (1-indexed)\n# This results in an empty matrix as there is only 1 column\nmatrix = matrix[0:2, 2:3]\n\n# Step 8: Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed) - no effect as the matrix is empty\n# Step 9: Map each occurrence of 8 to 1 - no effect as the matrix is empty\n# Step 10: Map each occurrence of 5 to 4 - no effect as the matrix is empty\n# Step 11: Crop the matrix to rows 1-1 and columns 1-1 (1-indexed) - no effect as the matrix is empty\n\n# Final matrix\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to see the final result.",
