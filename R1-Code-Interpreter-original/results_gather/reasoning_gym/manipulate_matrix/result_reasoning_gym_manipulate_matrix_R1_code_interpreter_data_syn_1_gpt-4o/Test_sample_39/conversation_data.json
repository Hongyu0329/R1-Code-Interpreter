    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of matrix transformations in the specified order. Let's break down each step and implement the transformations using Python.\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix.\n2. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: This involves transposing the matrix.\n3. **Rotate the matrix 270 degrees**: This is equivalent to rotating the matrix 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n4. **Crop the matrix to rows 7-7 and columns 1-4 (1-indexed)**: This means selecting the last row and the first four columns.\n5. **Vertically mirror the matrix**: This involves flipping the matrix upside down.\n6. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: Transpose the matrix again.\n7. **Remove every 4-th row (1-indexed)**: This means removing the 4th row if it exists.\n8. **Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed)**: This means removing every second row from the remaining matrix.\n9. **Vertically mirror the matrix**: Flip the matrix upside down again.\n10. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: Flip the matrix left to right.\n\nLet's implement these steps in Python:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [9, 0, 4, 2, 3, 4, 1, 3, 8, 0],\n    [9, 3, 8, 0, 8, 5, 7, 2, 5, 2],\n    [0, 5, 9, 0, 6, 9, 3, 2, 5, 6],\n    [7, 1, 0, 3, 9, 2, 2, 3, 8, 5],\n    [4, 9, 0, 4, 5, 3, 6, 0, 1, 1],\n    [3, 1, 4, 2, 6, 7, 7, 9, 9, 5],\n    [4, 1, 3, 4, 9, 3, 2, 9, 7, 7]\n])\n\n# Step 1: Identity transformation (no change)\n# Step 2: Mirror the matrix along the diagonal (transpose)\nmatrix = matrix.T\n\n# Step 3: Rotate the matrix 270 degrees (90 degrees counterclockwise)\nmatrix = np.rot90(matrix, k=3)\n\n# Step 4: Crop the matrix to rows 7-7 and columns 1-4 (1-indexed)\nmatrix = matrix[6:7, 0:4]\n\n# Step 5: Vertically mirror the matrix\nmatrix = np.flipud(matrix)\n\n# Step 6: Mirror the matrix along the diagonal (transpose)\nmatrix = matrix.T\n\n# Step 7: Remove every 4-th row (1-indexed)\nmatrix = np.delete(matrix, np.arange(3, matrix.shape[0], 4), axis=0)\n\n# Step 8: Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed)\nmatrix = np.delete(matrix, np.arange(1, matrix.shape[0], 2), axis=0)\n\n# Step 9: Vertically mirror the matrix\nmatrix = np.flipud(matrix)\n\n# Step 10: Horizontally mirror the matrix\nmatrix = np.fliplr(matrix)\n\n# Convert the final matrix to the required format\nresult = '\\n'.join(' '.join(map(str, row)) for row in matrix)\nprint(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will execute the series of transformations and output the final matrix in the specified format.",
