    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's break down each step:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix.\n2. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: The counterdiagonal of a matrix is the diagonal from the top-right to the bottom-left. Mirroring along this diagonal involves swapping elements symmetrically across this line.\n3. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: Repeating the previous step.\n4. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: Repeating the previous step again.\n5. **Map each occurrence of 8 to 9**: Replace all 8s in the matrix with 9s.\n6. **Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed)**: Remove the second row of the matrix.\n7. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: Perform the mirroring operation again.\n8. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: The diagonal is from the top-left to the bottom-right. Mirroring along this diagonal involves swapping elements symmetrically across this line.\n\nLet's implement these steps in Python to get the final matrix.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = np.array([[2, 1, 9],\n                   [5, 5, 8]])\n\n# Step 1: Identity transformation (no change)\n# Step 2, 3, 4: Mirror along the counterdiagonal three times\n# Mirroring along the counterdiagonal is equivalent to reversing the order of rows and columns\nmatrix = np.fliplr(np.flipud(matrix))\n\n# Step 5: Map each occurrence of 8 to 9\nmatrix[matrix == 8] = 9\n\n# Step 6: Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed)\nmatrix = np.delete(matrix, 1, axis=0)\n\n# Step 7: Mirror along the counterdiagonal\nmatrix = np.fliplr(np.flipud(matrix))\n\n# Step 8: Mirror along the diagonal\nmatrix = matrix.T\n\n# Print the final matrix\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the final matrix.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the final matrix after performing all the specified operations. The matrix is:\n\n```\n[[5]\n [5]\n [9]]\n```\n\nNow, let's format this matrix according to the required output format. The matrix should be presented in a single line with space-separated values, enclosed within triple angle brackets.\n\n<<<5 5 9>>>"
