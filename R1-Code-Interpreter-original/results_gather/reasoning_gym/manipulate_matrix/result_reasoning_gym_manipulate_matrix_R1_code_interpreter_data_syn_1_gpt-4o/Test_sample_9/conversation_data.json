    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of matrix transformations in the specified order. Let's break down each step and implement the transformations using Python.\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This step does nothing to the matrix.\n\n2. **Vertically mirror the matrix**: This involves flipping the matrix upside down.\n\n3. **Rotate the matrix 90 degrees**: This involves rotating the matrix 90 degrees clockwise.\n\n4. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: This involves flipping the matrix along the line from the top-right to the bottom-left corner.\n\n5. **Crop the matrix to rows 7-8 and columns 5-5 (1-indexed)**: This means we only keep the elements in the 7th and 8th rows and the 5th column.\n\n6. **Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed)**: This means we remove the second row from the remaining matrix.\n\n7. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: This involves flipping the matrix along the line from the top-left to the bottom-right corner.\n\n8. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: This involves flipping the matrix left to right.\n\nLet's implement these transformations in Python:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [3, 2, 6, 9, 4, 8, 4],\n    [6, 9, 0, 3, 0, 7, 2],\n    [2, 5, 2, 4, 9, 9, 0],\n    [1, 9, 0, 6, 4, 3, 1],\n    [5, 7, 2, 8, 0, 1, 1],\n    [2, 2, 0, 4, 5, 3, 9],\n    [0, 9, 9, 2, 6, 0, 4],\n    [6, 2, 1, 1, 6, 0, 7]\n])\n\n# Step 2: Vertically mirror the matrix\nmatrix = np.flipud(matrix)\n\n# Step 3: Rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\nmatrix = np.rot90(matrix, -1)\n\n# Step 4: Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal\nmatrix = np.fliplr(np.flipud(matrix.T))\n\n# Step 5: Crop the matrix to rows 7-8 and columns 5-5 (1-indexed)\nmatrix = matrix[6:8, 4:5]\n\n# Step 6: Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed)\nmatrix = matrix[::2]\n\n# Step 7: Mirror the matrix along the diagonal\nmatrix = matrix.T\n\n# Step 8: Horizontally mirror the matrix\nmatrix = np.fliplr(matrix)\n\n# Print the final matrix\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the final matrix.",
