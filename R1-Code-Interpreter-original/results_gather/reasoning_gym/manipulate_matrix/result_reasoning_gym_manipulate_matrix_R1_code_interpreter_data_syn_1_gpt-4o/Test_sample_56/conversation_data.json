    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of transformations on the given matrix. Let's break down each step and implement them using Python:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix.\n2. **Map each occurrence of 7 to 2**: Replace all 7s in the matrix with 2s.\n3. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: Transpose the matrix.\n4. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: Reverse each row of the matrix.\n5. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: This involves reversing both the rows and columns of the matrix.\n6. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: Transpose the matrix again.\n7. **Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed)**: Remove rows 2, 4, 6, etc.\n8. **Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed)**: Again, remove rows 2, 4, 6, etc., from the remaining matrix.\n9. **Map each occurrence of 1 to 6**: Replace all 1s in the matrix with 6s.\n\nLet's implement these steps in Python:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [5, 2, 0, 8, 0],\n    [5, 7, 2, 3, 1],\n    [2, 9, 2, 7, 6],\n    [5, 6, 2, 4, 2],\n    [1, 7, 5, 0, 2],\n    [3, 7, 3, 3, 2],\n    [0, 3, 8, 7, 8],\n    [0, 7, 6, 8, 6]\n])\n\n# Step 2: Map each occurrence of 7 to 2\nmatrix[matrix == 7] = 2\n\n# Step 3: Mirror the matrix along the diagonal (transpose)\nmatrix = matrix.T\n\n# Step 4: Horizontally mirror the matrix (reverse each row)\nmatrix = np.fliplr(matrix)\n\n# Step 5: Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal (reverse both rows and columns)\nmatrix = np.flipud(np.fliplr(matrix))\n\n# Step 6: Mirror the matrix along the diagonal (transpose again)\nmatrix = matrix.T\n\n# Step 7: Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed)\nmatrix = np.delete(matrix, np.arange(1, matrix.shape[0], 2), axis=0)\n\n# Step 8: Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed) again\nmatrix = np.delete(matrix, np.arange(1, matrix.shape[0], 2), axis=0)\n\n# Step 9: Map each occurrence of 1 to 6\nmatrix[matrix == 1] = 6\n\n# Print the final matrix\nfor row in matrix:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nThis code will execute the series of transformations and print the final matrix. Let's see the output.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the final matrix after performing all the specified operations is:\n\n```\n0 8 0 2 5\n2 0 5 2 6\n```\n\nThis matrix is the result of applying the transformations in the given order to the initial matrix. \n\n<<<0 8 0 2 5\n2 0 5 2 6>>>"
