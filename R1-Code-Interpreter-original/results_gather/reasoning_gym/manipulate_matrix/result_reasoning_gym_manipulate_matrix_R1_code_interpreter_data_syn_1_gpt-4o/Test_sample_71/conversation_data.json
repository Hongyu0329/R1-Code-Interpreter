    "To solve this problem, we need to perform two operations on the given matrix:\n\n1. **Identity Transformation**: This means we do nothing to the matrix, so it remains unchanged.\n\n2. **Mirror the Matrix along the Counterdiagonal**: The counterdiagonal of a matrix is the diagonal that runs from the top-right to the bottom-left. Mirroring along this diagonal involves swapping elements symmetrically across this diagonal.\n\nLet's break down the steps for mirroring along the counterdiagonal:\n\n- For a matrix element at position (i, j), its mirrored position along the counterdiagonal is (n-j-1, n-i-1), where n is the size of the matrix (assuming a square matrix).\n\nGiven the matrix is 9x5, we need to handle the non-square nature carefully. The counterdiagonal mirroring for a non-square matrix involves swapping elements such that the matrix is effectively rotated around the counterdiagonal.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the final matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [1, 9, 1, 6, 7],\n    [5, 1, 7, 1, 2],\n    [3, 9, 0, 0, 3],\n    [1, 2, 9, 8, 4],\n    [2, 6, 9, 6, 3],\n    [9, 9, 3, 1, 5],\n    [3, 9, 3, 9, 8],\n    [7, 4, 4, 3, 8],\n    [7, 8, 3, 8, 4]\n]\n\n# Dimensions of the matrix\nrows = len(matrix)\ncols = len(matrix[0])\n\n# Create a new matrix for the mirrored result\nmirrored_matrix = [[0] * rows for _ in range(cols)]\n\n# Perform the mirroring along the counterdiagonal\nfor i in range(rows):\n    for j in range(cols):\n        mirrored_matrix[cols - j - 1][rows - i - 1] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Print the final mirrored matrix\nfor row in mirrored_matrix:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nThis code will output the matrix after mirroring along the counterdiagonal. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the matrix after mirroring along the counterdiagonal. The matrix is now transformed, and we need to format it according to the specified output format.\n\nThe final matrix after performing the operations is:\n\n```\n4 8 8 5 3 4 3 2 7\n8 3 9 1 6 8 0 1 6\n3 4 3 3 9 9 0 7 1\n8 4 9 9 6 2 9 1 9\n7 7 3 9 2 1 3 5 1\n```\n\nNow, let's format this output as requested:\n\n<<<\n4 8 8 5 3 4 3 2 7\n8 3 9 1 6 8 0 1 6\n3 4 3 3 9 9 0 7 1\n8 4 9 9 6 2 9 1 9\n7 7 3 9 2 1 3 5 1\n>>>"
