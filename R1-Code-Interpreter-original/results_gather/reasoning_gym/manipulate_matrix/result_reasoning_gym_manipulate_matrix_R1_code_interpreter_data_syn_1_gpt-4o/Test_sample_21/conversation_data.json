    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identity Transformation**: This means we do nothing to the matrix. The matrix remains the same.\n\n2. **Rotate the Matrix 90 Degrees**: To rotate a matrix 90 degrees clockwise, we can take the transpose of the matrix and then reverse each row.\n\n3. **Remove Every 2-nd Row (1-indexed)**: After rotating the matrix, we will remove every second row, considering the rows are 1-indexed.\n\nLet's implement these steps in Python to get the final matrix.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [8, 7, 8, 5, 7, 0, 0, 2, 5],\n    [2, 4, 0, 2, 0, 5, 3, 7, 3],\n    [3, 2, 2, 5, 8, 5, 8, 6, 0],\n    [5, 4, 2, 1, 8, 6, 6, 7, 3],\n    [2, 0, 7, 7, 3, 5, 9, 3, 2]\n]\n\n# Step 1: Identity transformation (no change)\n# matrix remains the same\n\n# Step 2: Rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise\nrotated_matrix = np.array(matrix).T[:, ::-1]\n\n# Step 3: Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed)\nfinal_matrix = np.delete(rotated_matrix, np.arange(1, rotated_matrix.shape[0], 2), axis=0)\n\n# Convert the final matrix to a list of lists and print it\nfinal_matrix_list = final_matrix.tolist()\nfor row in final_matrix_list:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nThis code will execute the operations and print the final matrix. Let's see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the final matrix after performing the specified operations. Now, let's format the output as requested:\n\nThe final matrix after performing the identity transformation, rotating 90 degrees, and removing every 2-nd row is:\n\n```\n2 5 3 2 8\n7 2 2 0 8\n3 8 8 0 7\n9 6 8 3 0\n2 3 0 3 5\n```\n\nNow, let's enclose this matrix within triple angle brackets as required:\n\n<<<\n2 5 3 2 8\n7 2 2 0 8\n3 8 8 0 7\n9 6 8 3 0\n2 3 0 3 5\n>>>"
