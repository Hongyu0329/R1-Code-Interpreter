    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of matrix transformations and operations. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means the matrix remains unchanged.\n\n2. **Vertically mirror the matrix**: This involves flipping the matrix upside down.\n\n3. **Set all elements divisible by 3 to zero**: We need to iterate through the matrix and set any element divisible by 3 to zero.\n\n4. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: The counterdiagonal runs from the bottom-left to the top-right. This operation involves swapping elements across this diagonal.\n\n5. **Vertically mirror the matrix**: Again, flip the matrix upside down.\n\n6. **Set all elements divisible by 2 to zero**: Iterate through the matrix and set any element divisible by 2 to zero.\n\nLet's implement these steps in Python to get the final matrix.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [7, 6, 2, 5, 3, 8],\n    [7, 0, 6, 9, 3, 7],\n    [7, 4, 5, 3, 3, 9],\n    [2, 7, 8, 5, 6, 9],\n    [6, 4, 0, 1, 1, 3],\n    [4, 6, 1, 9, 0, 1],\n    [3, 4, 8, 7, 0, 4],\n    [6, 8, 2, 4, 8, 6],\n    [2, 8, 9, 1, 3, 9]\n])\n\n# Step 1: Identity transformation (no change)\n# Step 2: Vertically mirror the matrix\nmatrix = np.flipud(matrix)\n\n# Step 3: Set all elements divisible by 3 to zero\nmatrix[matrix % 3 == 0] = 0\n\n# Step 4: Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal\nmatrix = np.fliplr(matrix).T\n\n# Step 5: Vertically mirror the matrix\nmatrix = np.flipud(matrix)\n\n# Step 6: Set all elements divisible by 2 to zero\nmatrix[matrix % 2 == 0] = 0\n\n# Print the final matrix\nfor row in matrix:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the final matrix.",
