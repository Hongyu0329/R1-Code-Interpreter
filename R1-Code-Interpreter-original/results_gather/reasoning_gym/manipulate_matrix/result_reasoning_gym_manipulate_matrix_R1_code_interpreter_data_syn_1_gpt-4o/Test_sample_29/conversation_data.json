    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of matrix transformations and mappings. Let's break down the steps and implement them using Python:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix.\n2. **Vertically mirror the matrix**: This involves flipping the matrix upside down.\n3. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: This involves flipping the matrix left to right.\n4. **Map each occurrence of 7 to 0**: Replace all 7s with 0s.\n5. **Map each occurrence of 1 to 4**: Replace all 1s with 4s.\n6. **Remove every 3rd column (1-indexed)**: Remove columns 3, 6, etc.\n7. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: Flip the matrix left to right again.\n8. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: This involves flipping the matrix along the line from the bottom-left to the top-right.\n\nLet's implement these steps in Python:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [8, 3, 5, 4],\n    [5, 0, 7, 5],\n    [5, 1, 6, 7],\n    [5, 2, 5, 0],\n    [8, 1, 2, 5],\n    [0, 6, 2, 2],\n    [6, 4, 4, 5],\n    [7, 5, 9, 5],\n    [2, 9, 4, 6]\n])\n\n# Step 1: Identity transformation (no change)\n# Step 2: Vertically mirror the matrix\nmatrix = np.flipud(matrix)\n\n# Step 3: Horizontally mirror the matrix\nmatrix = np.fliplr(matrix)\n\n# Step 4: Map each occurrence of 7 to 0\nmatrix[matrix == 7] = 0\n\n# Step 5: Map each occurrence of 1 to 4\nmatrix[matrix == 1] = 4\n\n# Step 6: Remove every 3rd column (1-indexed)\nmatrix = np.delete(matrix, np.s_[2::3], axis=1)\n\n# Step 7: Horizontally mirror the matrix\nmatrix = np.fliplr(matrix)\n\n# Step 8: Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal\nmatrix = np.flipud(matrix.T)\n\n# Print the final matrix\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nThis code will execute the series of transformations and mappings on the matrix, and the final matrix will be printed. Let's see the output.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the final matrix was printed. Let's format the output to match the required format and provide the final answer.\n\nThe final matrix after performing all the operations is:\n\n```\n6 5 5 2 5 0 0 5 4\n4 9 4 2 2 5 6 0 5\n2 0 6 0 8 5 5 5 8\n```\n\nNow, let's enclose this matrix within triple angle brackets as requested:\n\n<<<\n6 5 5 2 5 0 0 5 4\n4 9 4 2 2 5 6 0 5\n2 0 6 0 8 5 5 5 8\n>>>"
