    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identity Transformation**: This operation means no change to the matrix. So, the matrix remains the same after this step.\n\n2. **Mirror the Matrix Along the Counterdiagonal**: The counterdiagonal of a matrix is the diagonal that runs from the top-right to the bottom-left. Mirroring along this diagonal involves swapping elements symmetrically across this diagonal.\n\nLet's define the matrix and perform these operations:\n\nGiven matrix:\n```\n3 7 4\n5 2 8\n2 2 0\n4 2 1\n```\n\n### Step-by-step Process:\n\n- **Identity Transformation**: The matrix remains unchanged.\n\n- **Mirror Along the Counterdiagonal**: We need to swap elements across the counterdiagonal. For a 4x3 matrix, the counterdiagonal mirroring involves swapping elements such that the element at position (i, j) is swapped with the element at position (n-j-1, m-i-1), where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the final matrix.\n\n```python\n# Define the original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [3, 7, 4],\n    [5, 2, 8],\n    [2, 2, 0],\n    [4, 2, 1]\n]\n\n# Get the dimensions of the matrix\nn = len(matrix)    # Number of rows\nm = len(matrix[0]) # Number of columns\n\n# Create a new matrix to store the result of the counterdiagonal mirroring\nmirrored_matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]\n\n# Perform the counterdiagonal mirroring\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(m):\n        mirrored_matrix[m-j-1][n-i-1] = matrix[i][j]\n\n# Print the final mirrored matrix\nfor row in mirrored_matrix:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nThis code will output the final matrix after performing the specified operations. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matrix is the result of mirroring the original matrix along the counterdiagonal. Now, let's format the output matrix according to the specified format and provide the final answer.\n\nThe final matrix after performing the operations is:\n\n```\n1 0 8 4\n2 2 2 7\n4 2 5 3\n```\n\nNow, let's present the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<1 0 8 4\n2 2 2 7\n4 2 5 3>>>"
