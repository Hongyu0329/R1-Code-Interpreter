    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identity Transformation**: This operation means no change to the matrix. We will keep the matrix as it is.\n\n2. **Crop the Matrix**: We need to crop the matrix to rows 7-10 and columns 4-6. The matrix is 1-indexed, so we need to adjust for 0-indexing in Python. This means we will take rows 6 to 9 and columns 3 to 5.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to get the final matrix.\n\n```python\n# Original matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [2, 8, 8, 4, 8, 3, 6],\n    [2, 2, 1, 7, 3, 3, 8],\n    [8, 8, 2, 7, 3, 0, 1],\n    [6, 1, 2, 7, 2, 2, 0],\n    [8, 4, 5, 5, 1, 3, 4],\n    [4, 0, 9, 4, 2, 5, 6],\n    [2, 3, 6, 9, 4, 0, 5],\n    [1, 4, 9, 4, 9, 7, 1],\n    [1, 3, 2, 5, 7, 8, 5],\n    [6, 1, 0, 5, 6, 6, 5]\n]\n\n# Cropping the matrix to rows 7-10 and columns 4-6 (1-indexed)\n# Which corresponds to rows 6-9 and columns 3-5 (0-indexed)\ncropped_matrix = [row[3:6] for row in matrix[6:10]]\n\n# Print the final matrix\nfor row in cropped_matrix:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nThis code will output the final cropped matrix. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the cropped matrix. Now, let's format the final answer according to the specified format.\n\nThe final matrix after performing the operations is:\n\n```\n9 4 0\n4 9 7\n5 7 8\n5 6 6\n```\n\nLet's enclose it within triple angle brackets as required:\n\n<<<9 4 0\n4 9 7\n5 7 8\n5 6 6>>>"
