    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of transformations on the given matrix. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means we start with the matrix as it is, without any changes.\n\n2. **Set all elements divisible by 1 to zero**: Since every integer is divisible by 1, this operation will set all elements of the matrix to zero.\n\n3. **Remove every 2-nd column (1-indexed)**: After setting all elements to zero, removing every 2-nd column will result in a matrix with half the number of columns, all filled with zeros.\n\n4. **Set all elements divisible by 8 to zero**: Since all elements are already zero, this operation will have no effect.\n\n5. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: This operation will reverse the order of columns in each row, but since all elements are zero, the matrix will remain unchanged.\n\nLet's implement these steps in Python to get the final matrix.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [8, 1, 2, 6, 3, 4, 0, 3, 1, 9],\n    [0, 1, 2, 8, 4, 6, 9, 6, 5, 5],\n    [1, 5, 4, 9, 2, 1, 8, 1, 9, 1],\n    [4, 5, 1, 4, 0, 5, 6, 1, 7, 7],\n    [3, 3, 2, 4, 3, 0, 0, 6, 0, 5],\n    [5, 7, 7, 9, 8, 2, 3, 7, 7, 5],\n    [9, 0, 4, 2, 0, 3, 0, 9, 9, 8],\n    [8, 4, 5, 9, 3, 6, 1, 5, 5, 1]\n])\n\n# Step 2: Set all elements divisible by 1 to zero\nmatrix[:] = 0\n\n# Step 3: Remove every 2-nd column (1-indexed)\nmatrix = np.delete(matrix, np.arange(1, matrix.shape[1], 2), axis=1)\n\n# Step 4: Set all elements divisible by 8 to zero (no effect since all are zero)\n\n# Step 5: Horizontally mirror the matrix\nmatrix = np.fliplr(matrix)\n\n# Print the final matrix\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the final matrix.",
    "The code executed correctly, and the final matrix is as expected after performing all the specified operations. The matrix is filled with zeros because setting all elements divisible by 1 to zero results in a matrix of zeros, and subsequent operations do not change this.\n\nThe final matrix, formatted as requested, is:\n\n<<<\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\n>>>"
