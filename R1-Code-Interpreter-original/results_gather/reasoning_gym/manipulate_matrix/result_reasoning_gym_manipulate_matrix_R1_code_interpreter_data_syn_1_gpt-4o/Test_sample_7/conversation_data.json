    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of transformations on the given matrix. Let's break down each step and implement them using Python:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This step involves no change to the matrix.\n\n2. **Map each occurrence of 0 to 3**: Replace all zeros in the matrix with threes.\n\n3. **Remove every 6-th column (1-indexed)**: This means removing the last column of the matrix.\n\n4. **Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal**: The counterdiagonal of a matrix runs from the top-right to the bottom-left. Mirroring along this diagonal involves swapping elements symmetrically across this diagonal.\n\n5. **Crop the matrix to rows 4-5 and columns 3-4 (1-indexed)**: This involves selecting a submatrix from the specified rows and columns.\n\n6. **Set all elements divisible by 8 to zero**: Replace elements that are divisible by 8 with zero.\n\n7. **Horizontally mirror the matrix**: Reverse the order of columns in each row.\n\nLet's implement these steps in Python:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [6, 0, 3, 3, 6, 9],\n    [0, 4, 5, 2, 0, 4],\n    [1, 5, 0, 1, 6, 5],\n    [6, 1, 6, 8, 9, 4],\n    [4, 1, 7, 6, 4, 9]\n])\n\n# Step 2: Map each occurrence of 0 to 3\nmatrix[matrix == 0] = 3\n\n# Step 3: Remove every 6-th column (1-indexed)\nmatrix = np.delete(matrix, 5, axis=1)\n\n# Step 4: Mirror the matrix along the counterdiagonal\nmatrix = np.fliplr(np.flipud(matrix.T))\n\n# Step 5: Crop the matrix to rows 4-5 and columns 3-4 (1-indexed)\ncropped_matrix = matrix[3:5, 2:4]\n\n# Step 6: Set all elements divisible by 8 to zero\ncropped_matrix[cropped_matrix % 8 == 0] = 0\n\n# Step 7: Horizontally mirror the matrix\nfinal_matrix = np.fliplr(cropped_matrix)\n\n# Print the final matrix\nprint(final_matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the final matrix.",
