    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of transformations on the given matrix. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identity Transformation**: This means we do nothing to the matrix, so it remains the same.\n\n2. **Rotate the Matrix 270 Degrees**: Rotating a matrix 270 degrees clockwise is equivalent to rotating it 90 degrees counterclockwise. This can be achieved by transposing the matrix and then reversing the order of the rows.\n\n3. **Rotate the Matrix 180 Degrees**: This can be done by reversing the order of both the rows and the columns of the matrix.\n\nLet's implement these transformations using Python code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [0, 5, 7, 8, 1, 7, 9, 4, 6, 6],\n    [7, 2, 0, 1, 6, 1, 8, 4, 5, 6],\n    [9, 9, 5, 9, 0, 8, 9, 3, 8, 6]\n])\n\n# Identity transformation (no change)\nidentity_matrix = matrix.copy()\n\n# Rotate 270 degrees (90 degrees counterclockwise)\nrotated_270 = np.rot90(identity_matrix, k=1)\n\n# Rotate 180 degrees\nrotated_180 = np.rot90(rotated_270, k=2)\n\n# Convert the final matrix to the required format\nfinal_matrix = rotated_180.tolist()\nformatted_output = '\\n'.join(' '.join(map(str, row)) for row in final_matrix)\n\nprint(formatted_output)\n```\n\nThis code will perform the required transformations and output the final matrix. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output is the final matrix after performing the specified transformations. Now, let's format the output to match the required format and provide the final answer.\n\nThe output matrix is:\n```\n9 7 0\n9 2 5\n5 0 7\n9 1 8\n0 6 1\n8 1 7\n9 8 9\n3 4 4\n8 5 6\n6 6 6\n```\n\nNow, let's enclose this matrix within triple angle brackets as requested:\n\n<<<\n9 7 0\n9 2 5\n5 0 7\n9 1 8\n0 6 1\n8 1 7\n9 8 9\n3 4 4\n8 5 6\n6 6 6\n>>>"
