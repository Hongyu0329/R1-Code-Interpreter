    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of transformations on the given matrix. Let's break down the operations step by step:\n\n1. **Identity transformation**: This means no change to the matrix.\n2. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: This operation transposes the matrix.\n3. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: Transposing the matrix again will return it to its original form.\n4. **Vertically mirror the matrix**: This operation flips the matrix upside down.\n5. **Mirror the matrix along the diagonal**: Transpose the matrix again.\n6. **Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed)**: This means removing rows 2, 4, 6, etc.\n\nLet's implement these steps in Python to get the final matrix.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [8, 8],\n    [7, 0],\n    [4, 1],\n    [3, 7],\n    [5, 6],\n    [7, 4],\n    [3, 7],\n    [4, 7],\n    [2, 2]\n])\n\n# Step 1: Identity transformation (no change)\n# Step 2: Mirror along the diagonal (transpose)\nmatrix = matrix.T\n\n# Step 3: Mirror along the diagonal again (transpose back)\nmatrix = matrix.T\n\n# Step 4: Vertically mirror the matrix (flip upside down)\nmatrix = np.flipud(matrix)\n\n# Step 5: Mirror along the diagonal (transpose)\nmatrix = matrix.T\n\n# Step 6: Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed)\nmatrix = np.delete(matrix, np.arange(1, matrix.shape[0], 2), axis=0)\n\n# Print the final matrix\nfor row in matrix:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nThis code will execute the transformations and print the final matrix. Let's see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, but the output format is not as expected. The final matrix should be printed in a specific format, with each row on a new line. Let's adjust the code to ensure the output matches the required format.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [8, 8],\n    [7, 0],\n    [4, 1],\n    [3, 7],\n    [5, 6],\n    [7, 4],\n    [3, 7],\n    [4, 7],\n    [2, 2]\n])\n\n# Step 1: Identity transformation (no change)\n# Step 2: Mirror along the diagonal (transpose)\nmatrix = matrix.T\n\n# Step 3: Mirror along the diagonal again (transpose back)\nmatrix = matrix.T\n\n# Step 4: Vertically mirror the matrix (flip upside down)\nmatrix = np.flipud(matrix)\n\n# Step 5: Mirror along the diagonal (transpose)\nmatrix = matrix.T\n\n# Step 6: Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed)\nmatrix = np.delete(matrix, np.arange(1, matrix.shape[0], 2), axis=0)\n\n# Prepare the final output in the required format\noutput = '\\n'.join(' '.join(map(str, row)) for row in matrix)\nprint(f\"<<<{output}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will format the output correctly, ensuring each row of the matrix is printed on a new line and enclosed within triple angle brackets. Let's see the result.",
    "The output is still not formatted correctly. It seems the matrix is being flattened into a single line instead of maintaining its 2D structure. Let's carefully review the operations and ensure the final output is formatted correctly.\n\nThe issue arises because the matrix is being transposed and manipulated in a way that doesn't preserve the intended row structure. Let's correct this by ensuring the operations are applied correctly and the output is formatted as a matrix.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = np.array([\n    [8, 8],\n    [7, 0],\n    [4, 1],\n    [3, 7],\n    [5, 6],\n    [7, 4],\n    [3, 7],\n    [4, 7],\n    [2, 2]\n])\n\n# Step 1: Identity transformation (no change)\n# Step 2: Mirror along the diagonal (transpose)\nmatrix = matrix.T\n\n# Step 3: Mirror along the diagonal again (transpose back)\nmatrix = matrix.T\n\n# Step 4: Vertically mirror the matrix (flip upside down)\nmatrix = np.flipud(matrix)\n\n# Step 5: Mirror along the diagonal (transpose)\nmatrix = matrix.T\n\n# Step 6: Remove every 2-nd row (1-indexed)\nmatrix = np.delete(matrix, np.arange(1, matrix.shape[0], 2), axis=0)\n\n# Prepare the final output in the required format\noutput = '\\n'.join(' '.join(map(str, row)) for row in matrix)\nprint(f\"<<<{output}>>>\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to ensure the matrix is printed correctly with each row on a new line.",
