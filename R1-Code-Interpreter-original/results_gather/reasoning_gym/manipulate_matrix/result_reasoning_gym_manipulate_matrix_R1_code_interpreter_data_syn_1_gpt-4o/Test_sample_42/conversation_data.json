    "To solve this problem, we need to perform a series of operations on the given matrix. The operations are:\n\n1. Identity transformation: This means we do not change the matrix in this step.\n2. Map each occurrence of the number 3 to the number 2.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n- First, we will represent the matrix in a format that allows us to manipulate it easily.\n- Then, we will iterate through each element of the matrix and replace any occurrence of the number 3 with the number 2.\n- Finally, we will output the transformed matrix in the specified format.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the initial matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [5, 1, 4],\n    [2, 3, 5],\n    [1, 7, 7],\n    [8, 4, 7],\n    [2, 5, 4],\n    [8, 9, 0],\n    [8, 0, 2],\n    [3, 7, 2],\n    [9, 6, 3],\n    [4, 4, 6]\n]\n\n# Perform the transformation: map 3 to 2\nfor i in range(len(matrix)):\n    for j in range(len(matrix[i])):\n        if matrix[i][j] == 3:\n            matrix[i][j] = 2\n\n# Print the final matrix\nfor row in matrix:\n    print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n```\n\nThis code will transform the matrix according to the specified operations and print the final result. Let's execute it to see the output.",
    "The code executed successfully without any errors, and the output matches the expected transformation of the matrix. The number 3 has been correctly mapped to 2 in the matrix.\n\nNow, let's format the final matrix output as specified, enclosed within triple angle brackets:\n\n<<<\n5 1 4\n2 2 5\n1 7 7\n8 4 7\n2 5 4\n8 9 0\n8 0 2\n2 7 2\n9 6 2\n4 4 6\n>>>"
