    "\nassistant > To find the antiderivative of the expression \\(-\\frac{35}{3}*x^{9} - \\frac{49}{6}\\), we will integrate each term separately with respect to \\(x\\).\n\n1. **Integrate the first term:**\n\n   The first term is \\(-\\frac{35}{3}*x^{9}\\). The antiderivative of \\(x^{n}\\) is \\(\\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}\\). Therefore, the antiderivative of \\(-\\frac{35}{3}*x^{9}\\) is:\n\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{35}{3}*\\frac{x^{10}}{10} = -\\frac{35}{30}*x^{10} = -\\frac{7}{6}*x^{10}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Integrate the second term:**\n\n   The second term is a constant \\(-\\frac{49}{6}\\). The antiderivative of a constant \\(c\\) is \\(c*x\\). Therefore, the antiderivative of \\(-\\frac{49}{6}\\) is:\n\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{49}{6}*x\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results and add the constant of integration \\(C\\):**\n\n   The antiderivative of the entire expression is:\n\n   \\[\n   -\\frac{7}{6}*x^{10} - \\frac{49}{6}*x + C\n   \\]\n\nLet's write the final answer in the required format.\nassistant > The antiderivative of the given expression is:\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{7}{6}*x^{10} - \\frac{49}{6}*x + C\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-7/6*x**10 - 49/6*x + C>>>"
