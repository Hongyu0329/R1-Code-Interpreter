For example, write 7*X**2 instead of 7*X^2.\n2. Always include the * symbol for all multiplication operations in your reasoning steps. For example, write `-3*X**3*sin(X) - 9*X**2*cos(X) + 18*X*sin(X) + 18*cos(X) + C` instead of `-3x3sin(x) - 9x2cos(x) + 18xsin(x) + 18cos(x) + C`.\n\nEnclose final answer within triple angle brackets, i.e. <<<the result of calculation>>>",

    "\nassistant > To find the antiderivative of the function \\(-5*X^{9}\\), we will use the power rule for integration. The power rule states that:\n\n\\[\n\\int X^{n} \\, dx = \\frac{X^{n+1}}{n+1} + C\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(n \\neq -1\\) and \\(C\\) is the constant of integration.\n\nFor the given function \\(-5*X^{9}\\), we can apply the power rule as follows:\n\n1. Identify the exponent \\(n\\) in the term \\(X^{9}\\), which is \\(9\\).\n2. Increase the exponent by 1: \\(9 + 1 = 10\\).\n3. Divide the term by the new exponent: \\(\\frac{-5}{10}*X^{10}\\).\n4. Simplify the coefficient: \\(-\\frac{5}{10} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nThus, the antiderivative is:\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{1}{2}*X^{10} + C\n\\]\n\nLet's write the final answer in the required format. \n\n\\[\n<<<-\\frac{1}{2}*X^{10} + C>>>\n\\]"
