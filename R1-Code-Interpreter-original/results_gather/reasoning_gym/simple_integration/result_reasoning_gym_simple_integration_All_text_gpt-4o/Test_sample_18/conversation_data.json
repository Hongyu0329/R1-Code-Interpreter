    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ (-20*X**9 + 48*X**5/5 + 18*X/5) dx, we will integrate each term separately. Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Integrate the first term: -20*X**9**\n\n   - The integral of X**n is (X**(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n   - For -20*X**9, n = 9.\n   - Integrate: ∫ -20*X**9 dx = -20 * (X**(9+1))/(9+1) = -20 * (X**10)/10 = -2*X**10.\n\n2. **Integrate the second term: 48*X**5/5**\n\n   - This term can be rewritten as (48/5)*X**5.\n   - For (48/5)*X**5, n = 5.\n   - Integrate: ∫ (48/5)*X**5 dx = (48/5) * (X**(5+1))/(5+1) = (48/5) * (X**6)/6 = (48/30)*X**6 = (8/5)*X**6.\n\n3. **Integrate the third term: 18*X/5**\n\n   - This term can be rewritten as (18/5)*X.\n   - For (18/5)*X, n = 1.\n   - Integrate: ∫ (18/5)*X dx = (18/5) * (X**(1+1))/(1+1) = (18/5) * (X**2)/2 = (18/10)*X**2 = (9/5)*X**2.\n\n4. **Combine the integrated terms and add the constant of integration C:**\n\n   - The integral of the entire expression is the sum of the integrals of the individual terms.\n   - Therefore, the indefinite integral is: -2*X**10 + (8/5)*X**6 + (9/5)*X**2 + C.\n\nThus, the final answer to the indefinite integral is:\n\n<<<-2*X**10 + (8/5)*X**6 + (9/5)*X**2 + C>>>"
