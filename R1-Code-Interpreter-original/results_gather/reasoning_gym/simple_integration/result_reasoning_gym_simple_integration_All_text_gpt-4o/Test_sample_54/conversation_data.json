    "To calculate the antiderivative of the function \\(-18*X**8 - 6*X\\), we will apply the power rule for integration. The power rule states that the antiderivative of \\(X^n\\) is \\(\\frac{X^{n+1}}{n+1}\\), provided \\(n \\neq -1\\).\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the terms**: The expression to integrate is \\(-18*X**8 - 6*X\\). This consists of two terms: \\(-18*X**8\\) and \\(-6*X\\).\n\n2. **Apply the power rule to each term**:\n   - For the first term \\(-18*X**8\\):\n     - The exponent of \\(X\\) is 8.\n     - According to the power rule, the antiderivative is \\(\\frac{-18*X^{8+1}}{8+1} = \\frac{-18*X**9}{9}\\).\n     - Simplify the coefficient: \\(-18/9 = -2\\).\n     - So, the antiderivative of \\(-18*X**8\\) is \\(-2*X**9\\).\n\n   - For the second term \\(-6*X\\):\n     - The exponent of \\(X\\) is 1.\n     - According to the power rule, the antiderivative is \\(\\frac{-6*X^{1+1}}{1+1} = \\frac{-6*X**2}{2}\\).\n     - Simplify the coefficient: \\(-6/2 = -3\\).\n     - So, the antiderivative of \\(-6*X\\) is \\(-3*X**2\\).\n\n3. **Combine the antiderivatives**: Add the antiderivatives of each term together and include the constant of integration \\(C\\):\n   - The combined antiderivative is \\(-2*X**9 - 3*X**2 + C\\).\n\n4. **Final answer**: The antiderivative of the given function is:\n\n\\[\n\\int (-18*X**8 - 6*X) \\, dX = -2*X**9 - 3*X**2 + C\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-2*X**9 - 3*X**2 + C>>>"
