    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ (18*X**8 - 15*X**2) dx, we will apply the power rule for integration. The power rule states that for any term of the form a*X**n, the integral is (a/(n+1))*X**(n+1) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nLet's break down the integral step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the terms**: The integrand is 18*X**8 - 15*X**2. This expression consists of two separate terms: 18*X**8 and -15*X**2.\n\n2. **Apply the power rule to each term**:\n   - For the first term, 18*X**8:\n     - The coefficient a is 18, and the exponent n is 8.\n     - According to the power rule, the integral of 18*X**8 is (18/(8+1))*X**(8+1) = (18/9)*X**9 = 2*X**9.\n\n   - For the second term, -15*X**2:\n     - The coefficient a is -15, and the exponent n is 2.\n     - According to the power rule, the integral of -15*X**2 is (-15/(2+1))*X**(2+1) = (-15/3)*X**3 = -5*X**3.\n\n3. **Combine the results**: Add the integrals of the individual terms together and include the constant of integration C:\n   - The integral of 18*X**8 is 2*X**9.\n   - The integral of -15*X**2 is -5*X**3.\n   - Therefore, the combined integral is 2*X**9 - 5*X**3 + C.\n\n4. **Final answer**: The indefinite integral of the given expression is:\n\n<<<2*X**9 - 5*X**3 + C>>>"
