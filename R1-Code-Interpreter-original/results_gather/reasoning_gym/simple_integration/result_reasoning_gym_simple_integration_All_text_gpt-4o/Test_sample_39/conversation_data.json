    "To calculate the antiderivative of the function \\(-54*x**5 + 5*x**4 + 18*x**2 + 9\\), we will integrate each term separately. The antiderivative of a polynomial term \\(a*x^n\\) is \\(\\frac{a}{n+1}*x^{n+1}\\). Let's apply this rule to each term:\n\n1. **Integrate \\(-54*x**5\\):**\n   - The exponent of \\(x\\) is 5, so \\(n = 5\\).\n   - The antiderivative is \\(\\frac{-54}{5+1}*x^{5+1} = \\frac{-54}{6}*x**6 = -9*x**6\\).\n\n2. **Integrate \\(5*x**4\\):**\n   - The exponent of \\(x\\) is 4, so \\(n = 4\\).\n   - The antiderivative is \\(\\frac{5}{4+1}*x^{4+1} = \\frac{5}{5}*x**5 = 1*x**5 = x**5\\).\n\n3. **Integrate \\(18*x**2\\):**\n   - The exponent of \\(x\\) is 2, so \\(n = 2\\).\n   - The antiderivative is \\(\\frac{18}{2+1}*x^{2+1} = \\frac{18}{3}*x**3 = 6*x**3\\).\n\n4. **Integrate \\(9\\):**\n   - This is a constant term, which can be considered as \\(9*x**0\\).\n   - The antiderivative is \\(\\frac{9}{0+1}*x^{0+1} = 9*x\\).\n\n5. **Combine all the antiderivatives and add the constant of integration \\(C\\):**\n   - The combined antiderivative is \\(-9*x**6 + x**5 + 6*x**3 + 9*x + C\\).\n\nThus, the antiderivative of the given function is:\n\n<<<-9*x**6 + x**5 + 6*x**3 + 9*x + C>>>"
