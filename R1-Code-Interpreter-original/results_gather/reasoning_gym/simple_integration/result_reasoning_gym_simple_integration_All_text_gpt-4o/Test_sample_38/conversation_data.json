    "To calculate the antiderivative of the function \\( \\int (2*X**5 - 40*X**3) \\, dx \\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the terms**: The function inside the integral is composed of two terms: \\( 2*X**5 \\) and \\( -40*X**3 \\).\n\n2. **Apply the power rule for integration**: The power rule for integration states that the antiderivative of \\( X**n \\) is \\( \\frac{X**(n+1)}{n+1} \\), provided \\( n \\neq -1 \\).\n\n3. **Integrate each term separately**:\n   - For the first term \\( 2*X**5 \\):\n     - Increase the exponent by 1: \\( 5 + 1 = 6 \\).\n     - Divide by the new exponent: \\( \\frac{2*X**6}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}*X**6 \\).\n\n   - For the second term \\( -40*X**3 \\):\n     - Increase the exponent by 1: \\( 3 + 1 = 4 \\).\n     - Divide by the new exponent: \\( \\frac{-40*X**4}{4} = -10*X**4 \\).\n\n4. **Combine the results**: Add the antiderivatives of each term together to get the overall antiderivative:\n   - \\( \\frac{1}{3}*X**6 - 10*X**4 \\).\n\n5. **Add the constant of integration**: Since we are finding an indefinite integral, we must add a constant of integration, \\( C \\).\n\nThus, the antiderivative of the given function is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3}*X**6 - 10*X**4 + C\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\\(\\frac{1}{3}*X**6 - 10*X**4 + C\\)>>>"
