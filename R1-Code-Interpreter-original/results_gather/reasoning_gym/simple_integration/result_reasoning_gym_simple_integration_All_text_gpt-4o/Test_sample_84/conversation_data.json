    "To calculate the antiderivative of the polynomial function ∫ (x**8 - 24*x**7 - 35*x**6 - 16*x) dx, we will integrate each term of the polynomial separately. The antiderivative of a polynomial term a*x**n is (a/(n+1))*x**(n+1), plus a constant of integration C. Let's apply this rule to each term in the polynomial:\n\n1. **Integrate x**8:**\n   - The term is x**8.\n   - The antiderivative is (1/(8+1))*x**(8+1) = (1/9)*x**9.\n\n2. **Integrate -24*x**7:**\n   - The term is -24*x**7.\n   - The antiderivative is (-24/(7+1))*x**(7+1) = (-24/8)*x**8 = -3*x**8.\n\n3. **Integrate -35*x**6:**\n   - The term is -35*x**6.\n   - The antiderivative is (-35/(6+1))*x**(6+1) = (-35/7)*x**7 = -5*x**7.\n\n4. **Integrate -16*x:**\n   - The term is -16*x.\n   - The antiderivative is (-16/(1+1))*x**(1+1) = (-16/2)*x**2 = -8*x**2.\n\n5. **Combine all the antiderivatives:**\n   - Combine the results from steps 1 to 4 and add the constant of integration C.\n   - The combined antiderivative is (1/9)*x**9 - 3*x**8 - 5*x**7 - 8*x**2 + C.\n\nTherefore, the antiderivative of the given polynomial is:\n\n<<<(1/9)*x**9 - 3*x**8 - 5*x**7 - 8*x**2 + C>>>"
