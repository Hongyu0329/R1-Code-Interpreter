    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ (63*X**8 - 231*X**6/5) dx, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Separate the Integral**: Break down the integral into two separate integrals for easier computation.\n   - ∫ (63*X**8) dx - ∫ (231*X**6/5) dx\n\n2. **Apply the Power Rule for Integration**: The power rule for integration states that ∫ X**n dx = (X**(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where n ≠ -1.\n\n3. **Integrate Each Term**:\n   - For the first term, ∫ (63*X**8) dx:\n     - Apply the power rule: (63*X**(8+1))/(8+1) = (63*X**9)/9\n     - Simplify: 63/9 = 7, so the integral becomes 7*X**9\n\n   - For the second term, ∫ (231*X**6/5) dx:\n     - First, factor out the constant: (231/5) * ∫ X**6 dx\n     - Apply the power rule: (231/5) * (X**(6+1))/(6+1) = (231/5) * (X**7)/7\n     - Simplify: (231/5) * (1/7) = 231/(5*7) = 231/35\n     - Further simplify: 231/35 = 33/5, so the integral becomes (33/5)*X**7\n\n4. **Combine the Results**: Combine the results of the two integrals and add the constant of integration C.\n   - The combined integral is: 7*X**9 - (33/5)*X**7 + C\n\n5. **Final Answer**: Enclose the final answer within triple angle brackets.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<7*X**9 - (33/5)*X**7 + C>>>"
