    "To calculate the antiderivative of the function \\(-8*x**7 - 7*x**6 + 10*x**5/3\\), we will integrate each term separately with respect to \\(x\\). The antiderivative of a polynomial term \\(a*x**n\\) is given by \\(\\frac{a}{n+1}*x**(n+1)\\).\n\nLet's break down the integration process step by step:\n\n1. **Integrate the first term \\(-8*x**7\\):**\n   - The exponent of \\(x\\) is 7, so we increase it by 1 to get 8.\n   - Divide the coefficient \\(-8\\) by the new exponent 8.\n   - The antiderivative of \\(-8*x**7\\) is \\(-\\frac{8}{8}*x**8 = -x**8\\).\n\n2. **Integrate the second term \\(-7*x**6\\):**\n   - The exponent of \\(x\\) is 6, so we increase it by 1 to get 7.\n   - Divide the coefficient \\(-7\\) by the new exponent 7.\n   - The antiderivative of \\(-7*x**6\\) is \\(-\\frac{7}{7}*x**7 = -x**7\\).\n\n3. **Integrate the third term \\(\\frac{10}{3}*x**5\\):**\n   - The exponent of \\(x\\) is 5, so we increase it by 1 to get 6.\n   - Divide the coefficient \\(\\frac{10}{3}\\) by the new exponent 6.\n   - The antiderivative of \\(\\frac{10}{3}*x**5\\) is \\(\\frac{10}{3*6}*x**6 = \\frac{10}{18}*x**6 = \\frac{5}{9}*x**6\\).\n\n4. **Combine the results and add the constant of integration \\(C\\):**\n   - The antiderivative of the entire expression is:\n     \\[\n     -x**8 - x**7 + \\frac{5}{9}*x**6 + C\n     \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-x**8 - x**7 + \\frac{5}{9}*x**6 + C>>>"
