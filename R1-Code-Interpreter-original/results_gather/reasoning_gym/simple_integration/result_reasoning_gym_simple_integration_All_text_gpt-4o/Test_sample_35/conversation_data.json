    "To calculate the antiderivative of the expression ∫ (2/3 - 35*x**4/9) dx, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Break down the integral**: The integral can be split into two separate integrals:\n   ∫ (2/3) dx - ∫ (35*x**4/9) dx.\n\n2. **Calculate the antiderivative of each part**:\n   - For the first part, ∫ (2/3) dx:\n     - The antiderivative of a constant a is a*x. Therefore, the antiderivative of 2/3 is (2/3)*x.\n\n   - For the second part, ∫ (35*x**4/9) dx:\n     - The antiderivative of x**n is (x**(n+1))/(n+1). Here, n = 4.\n     - Therefore, the antiderivative of x**4 is (x**5)/5.\n     - Multiply by the constant coefficient 35/9: (35/9) * (x**5)/5 = (35*x**5)/(9*5) = (35*x**5)/45.\n\n3. **Combine the results**:\n   - Combine the antiderivatives of the two parts: (2/3)*x - (35*x**5)/45.\n\n4. **Simplify the expression**:\n   - Simplify (35*x**5)/45: \n     - 35/45 can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 5, resulting in 7/9.\n     - Therefore, (35*x**5)/45 simplifies to (7*x**5)/9.\n\n5. **Add the constant of integration**:\n   - Since we are finding an indefinite integral, we need to add a constant of integration, C.\n\n6. **Final expression**:\n   - The final antiderivative is (2/3)*x - (7*x**5)/9 + C.\n\nThus, the antiderivative of the given expression is:\n\n<<<(2/3)*x - (7*x**5)/9 + C>>>"
