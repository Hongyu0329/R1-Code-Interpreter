    "To calculate the antiderivative of the function \\( \\int (16*X**7 - \\frac{5*X**4}{3} + 10*X) \\, dX \\), we will apply the power rule for integration to each term separately. The power rule states that the antiderivative of \\( X^n \\) is \\( \\frac{X^{n+1}}{n+1} \\), provided \\( n \\neq -1 \\).\n\nLet's break down the integration process step by step:\n\n1. **Integrate the first term: \\( 16*X**7 \\)**\n   - Apply the power rule: Increase the exponent by 1 and divide by the new exponent.\n   - The antiderivative of \\( 16*X**7 \\) is \\( \\frac{16*X**8}{8} \\).\n   - Simplify: \\( \\frac{16}{8} = 2 \\), so the antiderivative is \\( 2*X**8 \\).\n\n2. **Integrate the second term: \\( -\\frac{5*X**4}{3} \\)**\n   - Apply the power rule: Increase the exponent by 1 and divide by the new exponent.\n   - The antiderivative of \\( -\\frac{5*X**4}{3} \\) is \\( -\\frac{5*X**5}{3*5} \\).\n   - Simplify: The antiderivative is \\( -\\frac{5*X**5}{15} \\).\n   - Further simplify: \\( -\\frac{5}{15} = -\\frac{1}{3} \\), so the antiderivative is \\( -\\frac{1}{3}*X**5 \\).\n\n3. **Integrate the third term: \\( 10*X \\)**\n   - Apply the power rule: Increase the exponent by 1 and divide by the new exponent.\n   - The antiderivative of \\( 10*X \\) is \\( \\frac{10*X**2}{2} \\).\n   - Simplify: \\( \\frac{10}{2} = 5 \\), so the antiderivative is \\( 5*X**2 \\).\n\n4. **Combine all the antiderivatives and add the constant of integration \\( C \\):**\n   - The combined antiderivative is \\( 2*X**8 - \\frac{1}{3}*X**5 + 5*X**2 + C \\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2*X**8 - \\frac{1}{3}*X**5 + 5*X**2 + C>>>"
