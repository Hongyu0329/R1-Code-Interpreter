    "To find the indefinite integral of the function \\( \\int (100*X**9 + 90*X**8) \\, dx \\), we will apply the power rule for integration. The power rule states that the integral of \\( X^n \\) is \\( \\frac{X^{n+1}}{n+1} \\), provided \\( n \\neq -1 \\).\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the terms to integrate:**\n   - The expression inside the integral is \\( 100*X**9 + 90*X**8 \\).\n\n2. **Apply the power rule to each term:**\n   - For the first term \\( 100*X**9 \\):\n     - The power of \\( X \\) is 9.\n     - Increase the power by 1: \\( 9 + 1 = 10 \\).\n     - Divide by the new power: \\( \\frac{100*X**10}{10} \\).\n     - Simplify: \\( 10*X**10 \\).\n\n   - For the second term \\( 90*X**8 \\):\n     - The power of \\( X \\) is 8.\n     - Increase the power by 1: \\( 8 + 1 = 9 \\).\n     - Divide by the new power: \\( \\frac{90*X**9}{9} \\).\n     - Simplify: \\( 10*X**9 \\).\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   - The integral of the entire expression is the sum of the integrals of the individual terms.\n   - Therefore, the integral is \\( 10*X**10 + 10*X**9 \\).\n\n4. **Add the constant of integration:**\n   - Since this is an indefinite integral, we must add a constant of integration, denoted as \\( C \\).\n\n5. **Write the final answer:**\n   - The indefinite integral of the given function is \\( 10*X**10 + 10*X**9 + C \\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<10*X**10 + 10*X**9 + C>>>"
