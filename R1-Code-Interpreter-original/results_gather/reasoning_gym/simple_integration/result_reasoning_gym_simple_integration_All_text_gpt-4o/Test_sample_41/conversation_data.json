    "To calculate the antiderivative of the given expression, we need to integrate each term separately. The expression is:\n\n∫ (81*x**8/8 - 42*x**5 + 25*x**4/3) dx\n\nLet's break it down term by term:\n\n1. **Integrate 81*x**8/8:**\n\n   - The antiderivative of x**n is (x**(n+1))/(n+1).\n   - For 81*x**8/8, the coefficient is 81/8 and the power of x is 8.\n   - The antiderivative is (81/8) * (x**(8+1))/(8+1) = (81/8) * (x**9)/9.\n   - Simplifying, we get (81/72) * x**9 = (9/8) * x**9.\n\n2. **Integrate -42*x**5:**\n\n   - The antiderivative of x**n is (x**(n+1))/(n+1).\n   - For -42*x**5, the coefficient is -42 and the power of x is 5.\n   - The antiderivative is -42 * (x**(5+1))/(5+1) = -42 * (x**6)/6.\n   - Simplifying, we get -7 * x**6.\n\n3. **Integrate 25*x**4/3:**\n\n   - The antiderivative of x**n is (x**(n+1))/(n+1).\n   - For 25*x**4/3, the coefficient is 25/3 and the power of x is 4.\n   - The antiderivative is (25/3) * (x**(4+1))/(4+1) = (25/3) * (x**5)/5.\n   - Simplifying, we get (5/3) * x**5.\n\nNow, combine the antiderivatives of each term:\n\n∫ (81*x**8/8 - 42*x**5 + 25*x**4/3) dx = (9/8) * x**9 - 7 * x**6 + (5/3) * x**5 + C\n\nwhere C is the constant of integration.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(9/8) * x**9 - 7 * x**6 + (5/3) * x**5 + C>>>"
