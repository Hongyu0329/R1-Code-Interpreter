    "To calculate the antiderivative of the function \\(-20*X**3 + 21*X**2 + \\frac{2*X}{7} + 7\\), we will integrate each term separately. The antiderivative of a polynomial term \\(a*X^n\\) is \\(\\frac{a}{n+1}*X^{n+1}\\). For constant terms, the antiderivative is the constant multiplied by \\(X\\).\n\nLet's break down the integration process step by step:\n\n1. **Integrate \\(-20*X**3\\):**\n   - The antiderivative of \\(-20*X**3\\) is \\(\\frac{-20}{3+1}*X^{3+1} = \\frac{-20}{4}*X**4 = -5*X**4\\).\n\n2. **Integrate \\(21*X**2\\):**\n   - The antiderivative of \\(21*X**2\\) is \\(\\frac{21}{2+1}*X^{2+1} = \\frac{21}{3}*X**3 = 7*X**3\\).\n\n3. **Integrate \\(\\frac{2*X}{7}\\):**\n   - First, rewrite \\(\\frac{2*X}{7}\\) as \\(\\frac{2}{7}*X\\).\n   - The antiderivative of \\(\\frac{2}{7}*X\\) is \\(\\frac{2/7}{1+1}*X^{1+1} = \\frac{2/7}{2}*X**2 = \\frac{1}{7}*X**2\\).\n\n4. **Integrate \\(7\\):**\n   - The antiderivative of the constant \\(7\\) is \\(7*X\\).\n\n5. **Combine all the antiderivatives:**\n   - Combine the results from each term: \\(-5*X**4 + 7*X**3 + \\frac{1}{7}*X**2 + 7*X\\).\n\n6. **Add the constant of integration \\(C\\):**\n   - The final antiderivative is \\(-5*X**4 + 7*X**3 + \\frac{1}{7}*X**2 + 7*X + C\\).\n\nThus, the antiderivative of the given function is:\n\n<<<-5*X**4 + 7*X**3 + \\frac{1}{7}*X**2 + 7*X + C>>>"
