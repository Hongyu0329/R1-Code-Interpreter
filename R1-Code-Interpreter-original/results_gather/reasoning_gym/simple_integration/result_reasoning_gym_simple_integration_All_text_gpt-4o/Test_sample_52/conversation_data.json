    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ (24*x**7 - 28*x**6/5 + 33*x**5) dx, we will integrate each term separately. The general rule for integrating a term of the form a*x**n is to use the power rule for integration, which states:\n\n∫ a*x**n dx = (a/(n+1))*x**(n+1) + C\n\nwhere C is the constant of integration.\n\nLet's apply this rule to each term in the integral:\n\n1. **Integrate the first term: 24*x**7**\n\n   - Identify a = 24 and n = 7.\n   - Apply the power rule: ∫ 24*x**7 dx = (24/(7+1))*x**(7+1) = (24/8)*x**8 = 3*x**8.\n\n2. **Integrate the second term: -28*x**6/5**\n\n   - Identify a = -28/5 and n = 6.\n   - Apply the power rule: ∫ (-28/5)*x**6 dx = ((-28/5)/(6+1))*x**(6+1) = (-28/5)/7*x**7 = (-28/35)*x**7 = (-4/5)*x**7.\n\n3. **Integrate the third term: 33*x**5**\n\n   - Identify a = 33 and n = 5.\n   - Apply the power rule: ∫ 33*x**5 dx = (33/(5+1))*x**(5+1) = (33/6)*x**6 = (11/2)*x**6.\n\nNow, combine the results of the integrations and include the constant of integration C:\n\n∫ (24*x**7 - 28*x**6/5 + 33*x**5) dx = 3*x**8 - (4/5)*x**7 + (11/2)*x**6 + C\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<3*x**8 - (4/5)*x**7 + (11/2)*x**6 + C>>>"
