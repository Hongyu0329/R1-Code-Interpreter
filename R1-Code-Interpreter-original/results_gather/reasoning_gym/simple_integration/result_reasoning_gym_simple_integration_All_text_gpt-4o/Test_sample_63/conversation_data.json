    "To calculate the antiderivative of the function \\( f(X) = 2*X**9 - 30*X**4 + 3 \\), we will integrate each term separately. The antiderivative of a polynomial term \\( a*X**n \\) is given by \\( \\frac{a}{n+1}*X**(n+1) \\). Let's apply this rule to each term in the function.\n\n1. **Integrate the first term: \\( 2*X**9 \\)**\n   - The exponent of \\( X \\) is 9, so we increase it by 1 to get 10.\n   - Divide the coefficient 2 by the new exponent 10.\n   - The antiderivative of \\( 2*X**9 \\) is \\( \\frac{2}{10}*X**10 = \\frac{1}{5}*X**10 \\).\n\n2. **Integrate the second term: \\( -30*X**4 \\)**\n   - The exponent of \\( X \\) is 4, so we increase it by 1 to get 5.\n   - Divide the coefficient -30 by the new exponent 5.\n   - The antiderivative of \\( -30*X**4 \\) is \\( \\frac{-30}{5}*X**5 = -6*X**5 \\).\n\n3. **Integrate the third term: \\( 3 \\)**\n   - The term 3 is a constant, which can be considered as \\( 3*X**0 \\).\n   - Increase the exponent of \\( X \\) from 0 to 1.\n   - Divide the coefficient 3 by the new exponent 1.\n   - The antiderivative of \\( 3 \\) is \\( 3*X \\).\n\n4. **Combine the results and add the constant of integration \\( C \\)**\n   - The antiderivative of the entire function is the sum of the antiderivatives of each term.\n   - Therefore, the antiderivative of \\( 2*X**9 - 30*X**4 + 3 \\) is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{5}*X**10 - 6*X**5 + 3*X + C\n     \\]\n\nThe final answer, including the constant of integration, is:\n\n<<<\\(\\frac{1}{5}*X**10 - 6*X**5 + 3*X + C\\)>>>"
