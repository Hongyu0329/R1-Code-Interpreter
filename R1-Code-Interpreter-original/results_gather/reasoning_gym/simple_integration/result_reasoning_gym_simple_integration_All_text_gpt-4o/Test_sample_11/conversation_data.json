    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ (48*X**5 - 10/9) dx, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the terms in the integrand**: The integrand is composed of two terms: 48*X**5 and -10/9.\n\n2. **Apply the power rule for integration**: The power rule for integration states that ∫ X**n dx = (X**(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where n ≠ -1. We will apply this rule to the term 48*X**5.\n\n3. **Integrate the first term (48*X**5)**:\n   - The exponent of X is 5, so n = 5.\n   - According to the power rule, the integral of 48*X**5 is (48*X**(5+1))/(5+1) = (48*X**6)/6.\n   - Simplify the expression: (48/6)*X**6 = 8*X**6.\n\n4. **Integrate the second term (-10/9)**:\n   - The integral of a constant a is a*X. Therefore, the integral of -10/9 is (-10/9)*X.\n\n5. **Combine the results**: Add the integrals of the two terms together and include the constant of integration C.\n\nThe indefinite integral is:\n∫ (48*X**5 - 10/9) dx = 8*X**6 - (10/9)*X + C\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n<<<8*X**6 - (10/9)*X + C>>>"
