    "To find the indefinite integral of the function \\( \\int (7*x**7 - 2*x) \\, dx \\), we will apply the power rule for integration. The power rule states that the integral of \\( x^n \\) is \\( \\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C \\), where \\( C \\) is the constant of integration.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the terms to integrate**: The expression inside the integral is \\( 7*x**7 - 2*x \\). This expression consists of two separate terms: \\( 7*x**7 \\) and \\( -2*x \\).\n\n2. **Integrate each term separately**:\n   - For the first term \\( 7*x**7 \\):\n     - Apply the power rule: The integral of \\( x**7 \\) is \\( \\frac{x**8}{8} \\).\n     - Multiply by the constant coefficient 7: \\( 7 * \\frac{x**8}{8} = \\frac{7*x**8}{8} \\).\n\n   - For the second term \\( -2*x \\):\n     - Apply the power rule: The integral of \\( x \\) is \\( \\frac{x**2}{2} \\).\n     - Multiply by the constant coefficient -2: \\( -2 * \\frac{x**2}{2} = -x**2 \\).\n\n3. **Combine the results**: Add the integrals of the individual terms together:\n   - The integral of \\( 7*x**7 \\) is \\( \\frac{7*x**8}{8} \\).\n   - The integral of \\( -2*x \\) is \\( -x**2 \\).\n\n4. **Include the constant of integration**: Since this is an indefinite integral, we must add a constant of integration, \\( C \\).\n\n5. **Write the final result**: Combine all parts to express the final answer.\n\nThe indefinite integral of the given function is:\n\\[ \\int (7*x**7 - 2*x) \\, dx = \\frac{7*x**8}{8} - x**2 + C \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n<<<\\(\\frac{7*x**8}{8} - x**2 + C\\)>>>"
