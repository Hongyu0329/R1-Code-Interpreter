    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ (24*x**8 - 30*x**5 - 6) dx, we will integrate each term separately. The integral of a polynomial term a*x**n is (a/(n+1))*x**(n+1) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Integrate the first term: 24*x**8**\n   - The integral of 24*x**8 is (24/(8+1))*x**(8+1).\n   - Simplifying, we get (24/9)*x**9 = (8/3)*x**9.\n\n2. **Integrate the second term: -30*x**5**\n   - The integral of -30*x**5 is (-30/(5+1))*x**(5+1).\n   - Simplifying, we get (-30/6)*x**6 = -5*x**6.\n\n3. **Integrate the third term: -6**\n   - The integral of -6 is -6*x, since the integral of a constant a is a*x.\n\n4. **Combine the results and add the constant of integration C**\n   - The combined integral is (8/3)*x**9 - 5*x**6 - 6*x + C.\n\nTherefore, the indefinite integral of the given expression is:\n\n<<<(8/3)*x**9 - 5*x**6 - 6*x + C>>>"
