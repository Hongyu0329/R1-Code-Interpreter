    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ (9*x**8 - 32*x**7/5 - 35*x**6) dx, we will integrate each term separately. The integral of a polynomial term a*x**n is (a/(n+1))*x**(n+1) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nStep 1: Integrate the first term 9*x**8.\n- The power of x is 8, so n = 8.\n- The integral of 9*x**8 is (9/(8+1))*x**(8+1) = (9/9)*x**9 = x**9.\n\nStep 2: Integrate the second term -32*x**7/5.\n- The power of x is 7, so n = 7.\n- The coefficient is -32/5.\n- The integral of -32*x**7/5 is (-32/5)/(7+1)*x**(7+1) = (-32/5)/8*x**8 = (-32/40)*x**8 = (-4/5)*x**8.\n\nStep 3: Integrate the third term -35*x**6.\n- The power of x is 6, so n = 6.\n- The integral of -35*x**6 is (-35/(6+1))*x**(6+1) = (-35/7)*x**7 = -5*x**7.\n\nStep 4: Combine the results and add the constant of integration C.\n- The integral of the entire expression is x**9 - (4/5)*x**8 - 5*x**7 + C.\n\nTherefore, the indefinite integral of the given expression is:\n\n<<<x**9 - (4/5)*x**8 - 5*x**7 + C>>>"
