    "To calculate the antiderivative of the given expression, we need to integrate each term separately. The expression is:\n\n∫ (-64*X**7/3 + 15*X**2) dx\n\nLet's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Integrate the first term: -64*X**7/3**\n\n   - The general rule for integrating a term of the form a*X**n is: ∫ a*X**n dx = (a/(n+1))*X**(n+1) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n   - Here, a = -64 and n = 7/3.\n   - Applying the rule: ∫ -64*X**7/3 dx = (-64/(7/3 + 1))*X**(7/3 + 1) + C\n   - Simplify the exponent: 7/3 + 1 = 7/3 + 3/3 = 10/3\n   - So, the integral becomes: (-64/(10/3))*X**(10/3) + C\n   - Simplify the coefficient: -64/(10/3) = -64 * (3/10) = -192/10 = -19.2\n   - Therefore, the antiderivative of the first term is: -19.2*X**(10/3)\n\n2. **Integrate the second term: 15*X**2**\n\n   - Again, use the rule: ∫ a*X**n dx = (a/(n+1))*X**(n+1) + C\n   - Here, a = 15 and n = 2.\n   - Applying the rule: ∫ 15*X**2 dx = (15/(2+1))*X**(2+1) + C\n   - Simplify the exponent: 2 + 1 = 3\n   - So, the integral becomes: (15/3)*X**3 + C\n   - Simplify the coefficient: 15/3 = 5\n   - Therefore, the antiderivative of the second term is: 5*X**3\n\n3. **Combine the results**\n\n   - The antiderivative of the entire expression is the sum of the antiderivatives of the individual terms.\n   - Therefore, the antiderivative of the given expression is: -19.2*X**(10/3) + 5*X**3 + C\n\nThe final answer, including the constant of integration C, is:\n\n<<<-19.2*X**(10/3) + 5*X**3 + C>>>"
