    "To calculate the antiderivative of the given function, we need to integrate each term separately. The function is:\n\n\\[ \\int \\left( 54*X^{8/5} - 6*X^7 + \\frac{2*X^5}{3} + 18*X^2 - 6 \\right) \\, dx \\]\n\nLet's integrate each term one by one:\n\n1. **Integrate \\(54*X^{8/5}\\):**\n\n   - The antiderivative of \\(X^n\\) is \\(\\frac{X^{n+1}}{n+1}\\).\n   - Here, \\(n = \\frac{8}{5}\\).\n   - The antiderivative is \\(\\frac{54*X^{8/5 + 1}}{8/5 + 1} = \\frac{54*X^{13/5}}{13/5}\\).\n   - Simplify: \\(\\frac{54}{13/5} = 54 * \\frac{5}{13} = \\frac{270}{13}\\).\n   - So, the antiderivative is \\(\\frac{270*X^{13/5}}{13}\\).\n\n2. **Integrate \\(-6*X^7\\):**\n\n   - The antiderivative of \\(X^n\\) is \\(\\frac{X^{n+1}}{n+1}\\).\n   - Here, \\(n = 7\\).\n   - The antiderivative is \\(\\frac{-6*X^{7+1}}{7+1} = \\frac{-6*X^8}{8}\\).\n   - Simplify: \\(\\frac{-6}{8} = -\\frac{3}{4}\\).\n   - So, the antiderivative is \\(-\\frac{3*X^8}{4}\\).\n\n3. **Integrate \\(\\frac{2*X^5}{3}\\):**\n\n   - The antiderivative of \\(X^n\\) is \\(\\frac{X^{n+1}}{n+1}\\).\n   - Here, \\(n = 5\\).\n   - The antiderivative is \\(\\frac{2*X^{5+1}}{3*(5+1)} = \\frac{2*X^6}{18}\\).\n   - Simplify: \\(\\frac{2}{18} = \\frac{1}{9}\\).\n   - So, the antiderivative is \\(\\frac{X^6}{9}\\).\n\n4. **Integrate \\(18*X^2\\):**\n\n   - The antiderivative of \\(X^n\\) is \\(\\frac{X^{n+1}}{n+1}\\).\n   - Here, \\(n = 2\\).\n   - The antiderivative is \\(\\frac{18*X^{2+1}}{2+1} = \\frac{18*X^3}{3}\\).\n   - Simplify: \\(\\frac{18}{3} = 6\\).\n   - So, the antiderivative is \\(6*X^3\\).\n\n5. **Integrate \\(-6\\):**\n\n   - The antiderivative of a constant \\(c\\) is \\(c*X\\).\n   - So, the antiderivative is \\(-6*X\\).\n\nNow, combine all the antiderivatives and add the constant of integration \\(C\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{270*X^{13/5}}{13} - \\frac{3*X^8}{4} + \\frac{X^6}{9} + 6*X^3 - 6*X + C\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\\(\\frac{270*X^{13/5}}{13} - \\frac{3*X^8}{4} + \\frac{X^6}{9} + 6*X^3 - 6*X + C\\)>>>"
