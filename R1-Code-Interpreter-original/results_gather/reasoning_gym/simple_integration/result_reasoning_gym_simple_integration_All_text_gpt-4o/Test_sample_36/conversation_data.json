    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ (-9*x**8 - 56*x**7 + 6*x**5 + 16*x**3 + 6) dx, we will integrate each term of the polynomial separately. The general rule for integrating a term of the form a*x**n is:\n\n∫ a*x**n dx = (a/(n+1))*x**(n+1) + C\n\nwhere C is the constant of integration.\n\nLet's apply this rule to each term in the polynomial:\n\n1. Integrate the first term: -9*x**8\n   - The exponent n is 8, so n+1 = 9.\n   - The integral is (-9/9)*x**9 = -x**9.\n\n2. Integrate the second term: -56*x**7\n   - The exponent n is 7, so n+1 = 8.\n   - The integral is (-56/8)*x**8 = -7*x**8.\n\n3. Integrate the third term: 6*x**5\n   - The exponent n is 5, so n+1 = 6.\n   - The integral is (6/6)*x**6 = x**6.\n\n4. Integrate the fourth term: 16*x**3\n   - The exponent n is 3, so n+1 = 4.\n   - The integral is (16/4)*x**4 = 4*x**4.\n\n5. Integrate the constant term: 6\n   - The integral of a constant a is a*x.\n   - The integral is 6*x.\n\nNow, combine all the integrated terms and add the constant of integration C:\n\n∫ (-9*x**8 - 56*x**7 + 6*x**5 + 16*x**3 + 6) dx = -x**9 - 7*x**8 + x**6 + 4*x**4 + 6*x + C\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-x**9 - 7*x**8 + x**6 + 4*x**4 + 6*x + C>>>"
