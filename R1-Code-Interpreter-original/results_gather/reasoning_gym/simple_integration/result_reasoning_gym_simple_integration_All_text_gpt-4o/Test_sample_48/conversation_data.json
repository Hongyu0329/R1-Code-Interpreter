    "To find the indefinite integral of the given function, we need to integrate each term separately. The function is:\n\n∫ (-54*X**8/7 + 24*X**7 + 63*X**6/2 + 28*X**3) dx\n\nLet's integrate each term one by one:\n\n1. **Integrate -54*X**8/7:**\n\n   The integral of X**n is (X**(n+1))/(n+1). Therefore, for -54*X**8/7:\n\n   - The exponent of X is 8/7, so n = 8/7.\n   - The integral becomes: (-54/(8/7 + 1)) * X**(8/7 + 1)\n   - Simplify the exponent: 8/7 + 1 = 15/7\n   - The integral is: (-54/(15/7)) * X**(15/7)\n   - Simplify the coefficient: -54 * (7/15) = -378/15 = -126/5\n   - So, the integral is: (-126/5) * X**(15/7)\n\n2. **Integrate 24*X**7:**\n\n   - The exponent of X is 7, so n = 7.\n   - The integral becomes: (24/(7 + 1)) * X**(7 + 1)\n   - Simplify: 24/8 = 3\n   - The integral is: 3 * X**8\n\n3. **Integrate 63*X**6/2:**\n\n   - The coefficient is 63/2, and the exponent of X is 6, so n = 6.\n   - The integral becomes: ((63/2)/(6 + 1)) * X**(6 + 1)\n   - Simplify: (63/2)/7 = 63/14 = 9/2\n   - The integral is: (9/2) * X**7\n\n4. **Integrate 28*X**3:**\n\n   - The exponent of X is 3, so n = 3.\n   - The integral becomes: (28/(3 + 1)) * X**(3 + 1)\n   - Simplify: 28/4 = 7\n   - The integral is: 7 * X**4\n\nNow, combine all the integrated terms and add the constant of integration C:\n\n∫ (-54*X**8/7 + 24*X**7 + 63*X**6/2 + 28*X**3) dx = (-126/5) * X**(15/7) + 3 * X**8 + (9/2) * X**7 + 7 * X**4 + C\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<(-126/5) * X**(15/7) + 3 * X**8 + (9/2) * X**7 + 7 * X**4 + C>>>"
