    "To calculate the antiderivative of the function \\(-63*X**8 + 35*X**4\\), we will apply the power rule for integration. The power rule states that the antiderivative of \\(X^n\\) is \\(\\frac{X^{n+1}}{n+1}\\), provided \\(n \\neq -1\\).\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the terms to integrate:**\n   - The function to integrate is \\(-63*X**8 + 35*X**4\\).\n   - This function consists of two terms: \\(-63*X**8\\) and \\(35*X**4\\).\n\n2. **Apply the power rule to each term:**\n   - For the first term \\(-63*X**8\\):\n     - The exponent is 8. According to the power rule, the antiderivative is \\(\\frac{-63*X^{8+1}}{8+1} = \\frac{-63*X**9}{9}\\).\n     - Simplifying, we get \\(-7*X**9\\).\n\n   - For the second term \\(35*X**4\\):\n     - The exponent is 4. According to the power rule, the antiderivative is \\(\\frac{35*X^{4+1}}{4+1} = \\frac{35*X**5}{5}\\).\n     - Simplifying, we get \\(7*X**5\\).\n\n3. **Combine the antiderivatives:**\n   - The antiderivative of the entire function is the sum of the antiderivatives of the individual terms.\n   - Therefore, the antiderivative of \\(-63*X**8 + 35*X**4\\) is \\(-7*X**9 + 7*X**5\\).\n\n4. **Add the constant of integration:**\n   - When finding an indefinite integral, we must add a constant of integration, denoted as \\(C\\).\n\nThus, the antiderivative of the given function is:\n\n\\[\n-7*X**9 + 7*X**5 + C\n\\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<-7*X**9 + 7*X**5 + C>>>"
