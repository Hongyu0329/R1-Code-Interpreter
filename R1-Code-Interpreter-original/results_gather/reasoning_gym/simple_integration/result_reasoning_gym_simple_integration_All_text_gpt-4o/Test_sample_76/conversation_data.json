    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ 154*x**3/15 dx, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Simplify the integrand**: \n   - The integrand is 154*x**3/15. \n   - We can simplify the constant coefficient by dividing 154 by 15. \n   - 154 divided by 15 is 10.2666... (a repeating decimal), but for the purpose of integration, we can keep it as a fraction: 154/15.\n\n2. **Rewrite the integral**:\n   - The integral becomes ∫ (154/15)*x**3 dx.\n\n3. **Apply the power rule for integration**:\n   - The power rule for integration states that ∫ x**n dx = (x**(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n   - Here, n = 3, so we apply the power rule: ∫ x**3 dx = (x**(3+1))/(3+1) = x**4/4.\n\n4. **Integrate the function**:\n   - We integrate (154/15)*x**3 using the power rule: \n   - (154/15) * ∫ x**3 dx = (154/15) * (x**4/4).\n\n5. **Simplify the result**:\n   - Multiply the constant (154/15) by the result of the integration (x**4/4):\n   - (154/15) * (x**4/4) = (154*x**4)/(15*4) = (154*x**4)/60.\n\n6. **Include the constant of integration**:\n   - Since this is an indefinite integral, we add the constant of integration, C.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<(154*x**4)/60 + C>>>"
