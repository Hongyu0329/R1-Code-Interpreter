    "To calculate the antiderivative of the expression ∫ (25*x**4/3 - 21*x**2/2) dx, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Break down the integral**: The integral can be split into two separate integrals:\n   ∫ (25*x**4/3) dx - ∫ (21*x**2/2) dx\n\n2. **Apply the power rule for integration**: The power rule for integration states that ∫ x**n dx = (x**(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where n ≠ -1.\n\n3. **Integrate the first term (25*x**4/3)**:\n   - Identify the power of x: Here, n = 4/3.\n   - Apply the power rule: ∫ (25*x**4/3) dx = 25 * (x**(4/3 + 1))/(4/3 + 1)\n   - Simplify the exponent: 4/3 + 1 = 7/3\n   - Simplify the expression: 25 * (x**(7/3))/(7/3) = 25 * (3/7) * x**(7/3) = (75/7) * x**(7/3)\n\n4. **Integrate the second term (21*x**2/2)**:\n   - Identify the power of x: Here, n = 2.\n   - Apply the power rule: ∫ (21*x**2/2) dx = (21/2) * (x**(2+1))/(2+1)\n   - Simplify the exponent: 2 + 1 = 3\n   - Simplify the expression: (21/2) * (x**3)/3 = (21/6) * x**3 = (7/2) * x**3\n\n5. **Combine the results**: Combine the antiderivatives of the two terms:\n   (75/7) * x**(7/3) - (7/2) * x**3 + C\n\n6. **Include the constant of integration**: Since this is an indefinite integral, include the constant of integration, C.\n\nThe final antiderivative of the given expression is:\n<<<(75/7) * x**(7/3) - (7/2) * x**3 + C>>>"
