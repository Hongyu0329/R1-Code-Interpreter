    "To evaluate the indefinite integral of the polynomial expression ∫ (10*X**9 + 81*X**8 + 16*X**3 + 12*X**2) dx, we will integrate each term separately. The general rule for integrating a term of the form a*X**n is to use the power rule for integration, which states:\n\n∫ a*X**n dx = (a/(n+1))*X**(n+1) + C\n\nwhere C is the constant of integration.\n\nLet's apply this rule to each term in the polynomial:\n\n1. **Integrate 10*X**9:**\n   - The exponent n is 9, so n+1 = 10.\n   - The coefficient a is 10.\n   - Applying the power rule: ∫ 10*X**9 dx = (10/10)*X**10 = X**10.\n\n2. **Integrate 81*X**8:**\n   - The exponent n is 8, so n+1 = 9.\n   - The coefficient a is 81.\n   - Applying the power rule: ∫ 81*X**8 dx = (81/9)*X**9 = 9*X**9.\n\n3. **Integrate 16*X**3:**\n   - The exponent n is 3, so n+1 = 4.\n   - The coefficient a is 16.\n   - Applying the power rule: ∫ 16*X**3 dx = (16/4)*X**4 = 4*X**4.\n\n4. **Integrate 12*X**2:**\n   - The exponent n is 2, so n+1 = 3.\n   - The coefficient a is 12.\n   - Applying the power rule: ∫ 12*X**2 dx = (12/3)*X**3 = 4*X**3.\n\nNow, we combine all the integrated terms and include the constant of integration C:\n\n∫ (10*X**9 + 81*X**8 + 16*X**3 + 12*X**2) dx = X**10 + 9*X**9 + 4*X**4 + 4*X**3 + C\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<X**10 + 9*X**9 + 4*X**4 + 4*X**3 + C>>>"
