    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ (-36*X**8 + 49*X**6/6) dx, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Break down the integral**: The integral can be split into two separate integrals:\n   ∫ (-36*X**8) dx + ∫ (49*X**6/6) dx.\n\n2. **Apply the power rule for integration**: The power rule for integration states that ∫ X**n dx = (X**(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where n ≠ -1.\n\n3. **Integrate the first term**: \n   - The first term is -36*X**8.\n   - Applying the power rule: ∫ (-36*X**8) dx = -36 * (X**(8+1))/(8+1) + C = -36 * (X**9)/9 + C.\n   - Simplify: -36/9 = -4, so the integral becomes -4*X**9 + C.\n\n4. **Integrate the second term**:\n   - The second term is 49*X**6/6.\n   - Applying the power rule: ∫ (49*X**6/6) dx = (49/6) * (X**(6+1))/(6+1) + C = (49/6) * (X**7)/7 + C.\n   - Simplify: (49/6)/7 = 49/(6*7) = 49/42.\n   - Further simplify: 49/42 = 7/6, so the integral becomes (7/6)*X**7 + C.\n\n5. **Combine the results**: \n   - Combine the results of the two integrals: -4*X**9 + (7/6)*X**7 + C.\n\n6. **Final answer**: \n   - The indefinite integral of the given function is -4*X**9 + (7/6)*X**7 + C.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-4*X**9 + (7/6)*X**7 + C>>>"
