    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ -8*X**4 - 24*X**2 dx, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Integral Components**: The integral is composed of two terms: -8*X**4 and -24*X**2. We will integrate each term separately.\n\n2. **Apply the Power Rule for Integration**: The power rule for integration states that ∫ X**n dx = (X**(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where n ≠ -1. We will apply this rule to each term.\n\n3. **Integrate the First Term (-8*X**4)**:\n   - The term is -8*X**4.\n   - Using the power rule, integrate: ∫ -8*X**4 dx = -8 * (X**(4+1))/(4+1) = -8 * (X**5)/5.\n   - Simplify: -8/5 * X**5.\n\n4. **Integrate the Second Term (-24*X**2)**:\n   - The term is -24*X**2.\n   - Using the power rule, integrate: ∫ -24*X**2 dx = -24 * (X**(2+1))/(2+1) = -24 * (X**3)/3.\n   - Simplify: -8 * X**3.\n\n5. **Combine the Results**: Add the integrated terms together and include the constant of integration (C):\n   - The integral of the entire expression is: -8/5 * X**5 - 8 * X**3 + C.\n\n6. **Final Answer**: The indefinite integral of the given expression is:\n\n<<<-8/5 * X**5 - 8 * X**3 + C>>>"
