    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ -20*x**3 - 2*x dx, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Integral Components**: The integral is composed of two terms: -20*x**3 and -2*x. We will integrate each term separately.\n\n2. **Apply the Power Rule for Integration**: The power rule for integration states that ∫ x**n dx = (x**(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where n ≠ -1. We will apply this rule to each term.\n\n3. **Integrate the First Term (-20*x**3)**:\n   - The term is -20*x**3.\n   - Using the power rule, integrate x**3: ∫ x**3 dx = (x**(3+1))/(3+1) = (x**4)/4.\n   - Multiply by the constant coefficient -20: -20 * (x**4)/4 = -5*x**4.\n\n4. **Integrate the Second Term (-2*x)**:\n   - The term is -2*x.\n   - Using the power rule, integrate x: ∫ x dx = (x**(1+1))/(1+1) = (x**2)/2.\n   - Multiply by the constant coefficient -2: -2 * (x**2)/2 = -x**2.\n\n5. **Combine the Results**: Add the integrated results of each term together and include the constant of integration C:\n   - The integral of -20*x**3 is -5*x**4.\n   - The integral of -2*x is -x**2.\n   - Combine these results: -5*x**4 - x**2 + C.\n\n6. **Final Answer**: The indefinite integral of the given expression is:\n\n<<<-5*x**4 - x**2 + C>>>"
