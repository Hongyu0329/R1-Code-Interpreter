    "To calculate the antiderivative of the given expression, we need to integrate each term separately. The expression is:\n\n∫ (56*x**(6/5) - 18*x**5 + 7/6) dx\n\nLet's break it down term by term:\n\n1. **Integrate 56*x**(6/5):**\n\n   - The general rule for integrating x**n is: ∫ x**n dx = (x**(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where n ≠ -1.\n   - Here, n = 6/5. So, we apply the rule:\n   - ∫ 56*x**(6/5) dx = 56 * (x**(6/5 + 1))/(6/5 + 1)\n   - Simplify the exponent: 6/5 + 1 = 11/5\n   - Therefore, ∫ 56*x**(6/5) dx = 56 * (x**(11/5))/(11/5)\n   - Simplify the fraction: 56/(11/5) = 56 * (5/11) = 280/11\n   - So, the antiderivative of this term is: (280/11) * x**(11/5)\n\n2. **Integrate -18*x**5:**\n\n   - Again, use the rule: ∫ x**n dx = (x**(n+1))/(n+1) + C\n   - Here, n = 5. So, we apply the rule:\n   - ∫ -18*x**5 dx = -18 * (x**(5+1))/(5+1)\n   - Simplify: -18 * (x**6)/6\n   - Simplify further: -18/6 = -3\n   - So, the antiderivative of this term is: -3 * x**6\n\n3. **Integrate 7/6:**\n\n   - The integral of a constant a is: ∫ a dx = a*x + C\n   - Here, the constant is 7/6.\n   - So, ∫ 7/6 dx = (7/6) * x\n\nNow, combine all the antiderivatives and add the constant of integration C:\n\nThe antiderivative of the entire expression is:\n\n(280/11) * x**(11/5) - 3 * x**6 + (7/6) * x + C\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<(280/11) * x**(11/5) - 3 * x**6 + (7/6) * x + C>>>"
