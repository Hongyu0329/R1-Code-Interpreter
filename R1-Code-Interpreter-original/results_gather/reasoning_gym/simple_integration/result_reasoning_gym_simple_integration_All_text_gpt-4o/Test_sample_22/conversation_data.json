    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ (-8*X**7 + 146*X**6/9) dx, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Break down the integral**: The integral can be split into two separate integrals:\n   ∫ (-8*X**7) dx + ∫ (146*X**6/9) dx.\n\n2. **Integrate each term separately**:\n   - For the first term, ∫ (-8*X**7) dx:\n     - Use the power rule for integration, which states that ∫ X**n dx = (X**(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where n ≠ -1.\n     - Here, n = 7, so the integral becomes:\n       -8 * (X**(7+1))/(7+1) = -8 * (X**8)/8 = -X**8.\n\n   - For the second term, ∫ (146*X**6/9) dx:\n     - Again, use the power rule for integration.\n     - Here, n = 6, so the integral becomes:\n       (146/9) * (X**(6+1))/(6+1) = (146/9) * (X**7)/7 = (146*X**7)/(63).\n\n3. **Combine the results**:\n   - Combine the results of the two integrals:\n     -X**8 + (146*X**7)/(63) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\n4. **Simplify the expression**:\n   - The expression is already simplified, so the final answer is:\n     -X**8 + (146*X**7)/(63) + C.\n\nTherefore, the indefinite integral of the given function is:\n\n<<<-X**8 + (146*X**7)/(63) + C>>>"
