    "To calculate the antiderivative of the function ∫ (7 - 72*X**8) dx, we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the terms**: The integrand is composed of two terms: 7 and -72*X**8.\n\n2. **Apply the power rule for integration**: The power rule for integration states that ∫ X**n dx = (1/(n+1)) * X**(n+1) + C, where n ≠ -1. We will apply this rule to each term separately.\n\n3. **Integrate the constant term**: \n   - The integral of a constant, such as 7, with respect to X is simply the constant multiplied by X. \n   - Therefore, ∫ 7 dx = 7*X.\n\n4. **Integrate the power of X term**:\n   - For the term -72*X**8, we apply the power rule.\n   - The exponent n here is 8, so we increase the exponent by 1 to get 9.\n   - The antiderivative of X**8 is (1/9) * X**9.\n   - Therefore, ∫ -72*X**8 dx = -72 * (1/9) * X**9 = -8*X**9.\n\n5. **Combine the results**: \n   - Combine the antiderivatives of each term to get the overall antiderivative.\n   - The antiderivative of the entire expression is 7*X - 8*X**9.\n\n6. **Add the constant of integration**: \n   - Since we are finding an indefinite integral, we must add a constant of integration, C, to the result.\n\nPutting it all together, the antiderivative of the given function is:\n\n<<<7*X - 8*X**9 + C>>>"
