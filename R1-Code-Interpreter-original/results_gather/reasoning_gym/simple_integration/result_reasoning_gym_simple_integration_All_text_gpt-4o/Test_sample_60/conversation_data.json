    "To calculate the antiderivative of the function \\( f(X) = 80*X**9 - 90*X**8 + \\frac{2*X}{3} + 1 \\), we will integrate each term separately. The antiderivative of a polynomial term \\( a*X^n \\) is given by \\( \\frac{a}{n+1}*X^{n+1} \\). Let's apply this rule to each term:\n\n1. **Integrate the first term: \\( 80*X**9 \\)**\n   - The antiderivative of \\( 80*X**9 \\) is \\( \\frac{80}{9+1}*X^{9+1} = \\frac{80}{10}*X^{10} = 8*X^{10} \\).\n\n2. **Integrate the second term: \\( -90*X**8 \\)**\n   - The antiderivative of \\( -90*X**8 \\) is \\( \\frac{-90}{8+1}*X^{8+1} = \\frac{-90}{9}*X^{9} = -10*X^{9} \\).\n\n3. **Integrate the third term: \\( \\frac{2*X}{3} \\)**\n   - Rewrite the term as \\( \\frac{2}{3}*X \\).\n   - The antiderivative of \\( \\frac{2}{3}*X \\) is \\( \\frac{\\frac{2}{3}}{1+1}*X^{1+1} = \\frac{2}{3*2}*X^{2} = \\frac{1}{3}*X^{2} \\).\n\n4. **Integrate the fourth term: \\( 1 \\)**\n   - The antiderivative of \\( 1 \\) is \\( X \\).\n\n5. **Combine all the antiderivatives and add the constant of integration \\( C \\):**\n   - The antiderivative of the entire function is:\n     \\[\n     8*X^{10} - 10*X^{9} + \\frac{1}{3}*X^{2} + X + C\n     \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<8*X**10 - 10*X**9 + 1/3*X**2 + X + C>>>"
