    "To calculate the antiderivative of the function \\(-5*X**9\\), we need to follow the rules of integration for power functions. The general rule for integrating a power function \\(a*X**n\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\int a*X**n \\, dx = \\frac{a}{n+1}*X**(n+1) + C\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(C\\) is the constant of integration.\n\nLet's apply this rule step by step to the given function \\(-5*X**9\\):\n\n1. **Identify the coefficient and the exponent:**\n   - The coefficient \\(a\\) is \\(-5\\).\n   - The exponent \\(n\\) is \\(9\\).\n\n2. **Apply the power rule for integration:**\n   - According to the rule, we increase the exponent by 1: \\(n + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10\\).\n   - Divide the coefficient by the new exponent: \\(\\frac{-5}{10}\\).\n\n3. **Write the integrated function:**\n   - The integrated function becomes \\(\\frac{-5}{10}*X**10\\).\n\n4. **Simplify the coefficient:**\n   - Simplify \\(\\frac{-5}{10}\\) to \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n5. **Include the constant of integration:**\n   - Add the constant of integration \\(C\\).\n\nThus, the antiderivative of \\(-5*X**9\\) is:\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{1}{2}*X**10 + C\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-\\frac{1}{2}*X**10 + C>>>"
