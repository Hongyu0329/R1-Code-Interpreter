    "To evaluate the indefinite integral ∫ 18*X**8 - 15*X**2 dx, we need to integrate each term separately.\n\n1. The integral of 18*X**8 with respect to X is:\n   - Use the power rule for integration: ∫ X**n dx = (X**(n+1))/(n+1) + C\n   - For 18*X**8, n = 8, so the integral is (18*X**(8+1))/(8+1) = (18*X**9)/9 = 2*X**9\n\n2. The integral of -15*X**2 with respect to X is:\n   - Again, use the power rule: ∫ X**n dx = (X**(n+1))/(n+1) + C\n   - For -15*X**2, n = 2, so the integral is (-15*X**(2+1))/(2+1) = (-15*X**3)/3 = -5*X**3\n\nNow, combine the results of the two integrals and add the constant of integration C:\n\n∫ (18*X**8 - 15*X**2) dx = 2*X**9 - 5*X**3 + C\n\nLet's verify this calculation using Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate\n\n# Define the variable\nX = symbols('X')\n\n# Define the function to integrate\nfunction = 18*X**8 - 15*X**2\n\n# Perform the integration\nintegral_result = integrate(function, X)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(integral_result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the integration result.",
    "The code output confirms the integration result, and there are no errors. Therefore, the indefinite integral of the given function is:\n\n<<<2*X**9 - 5*X**3 + C>>>"
