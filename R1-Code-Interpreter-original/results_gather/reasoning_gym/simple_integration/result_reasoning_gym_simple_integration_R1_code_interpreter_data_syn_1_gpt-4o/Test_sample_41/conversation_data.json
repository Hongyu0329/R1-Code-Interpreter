    "To find the antiderivative of the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{81}{8}*x^8 - 42*x^5 + \\frac{25}{3}*x^4 \\), we need to integrate each term separately. The antiderivative of a power function \\( x^n \\) is given by \\( \\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} \\).\n\nLet's break down the integration process for each term:\n\n1. For the term \\(\\frac{81}{8}*x^8\\):\n   - The antiderivative is \\(\\frac{81}{8}*\\frac{x^{9}}{9} = \\frac{81}{72}*x^9\\).\n\n2. For the term \\(-42*x^5\\):\n   - The antiderivative is \\(-42*\\frac{x^{6}}{6} = -7*x^6\\).\n\n3. For the term \\(\\frac{25}{3}*x^4\\):\n   - The antiderivative is \\(\\frac{25}{3}*\\frac{x^{5}}{5} = \\frac{25}{15}*x^5 = \\frac{5}{3}*x^5\\).\n\nNow, let's compute these values using Python to ensure accuracy and combine them to form the final antiderivative expression.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the function\nf = (81/8)*x**8 - 42*x**5 + (25/3)*x**4\n\n# Calculate the antiderivative\nantiderivative = integrate(f, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(antiderivative)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the antiderivative of the given function.",
    "The code has successfully calculated the antiderivative of the given function. The output represents the antiderivative expression:\n\n- The term \\(1.125*x^9\\) corresponds to \\(\\frac{81}{72}*x^9\\).\n- The term \\(-7.0*x^6\\) corresponds to \\(-7*x^6\\).\n- The term \\(1.66666666666667*x^5\\) corresponds to \\(\\frac{5}{3}*x^5\\).\n\nThus, the antiderivative of the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{81}{8}*x^8 - 42*x^5 + \\frac{25}{3}*x^4 \\) is:\n\n<<<1.125*x**9 - 7.0*x**6 + 1.66666666666667*x**5 + C>>>\n\nwhere \\( C \\) is the constant of integration."
