    "To evaluate the indefinite integral of the function \\(-20*X**9 + \\frac{48*X**5}{5} + \\frac{18*X}{5}\\), we need to integrate each term separately with respect to \\(X\\).\n\nThe general rule for integrating a term of the form \\(a*X^n\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\int a*X^n \\, dx = \\frac{a}{n+1}*X^{n+1} + C\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(C\\) is the constant of integration.\n\nLet's apply this rule to each term in the integral:\n\n1. For the term \\(-20*X**9\\):\n   \\[\n   \\int -20*X**9 \\, dx = \\frac{-20}{9+1}*X^{9+1} = -2*X^{10}\n   \\]\n\n2. For the term \\(\\frac{48*X**5}{5}\\):\n   \\[\n   \\int \\frac{48*X**5}{5} \\, dx = \\frac{48/5}{5+1}*X^{5+1} = \\frac{48}{30}*X^6 = \\frac{8}{5}*X^6\n   \\]\n\n3. For the term \\(\\frac{18*X}{5}\\):\n   \\[\n   \\int \\frac{18*X}{5} \\, dx = \\frac{18/5}{1+1}*X^{1+1} = \\frac{18}{10}*X^2 = \\frac{9}{5}*X^2\n   \\]\n\nNow, we combine these results and add the constant of integration \\(C\\):\n\n\\[\n\\int \\left(-20*X**9 + \\frac{48*X**5}{5} + \\frac{18*X}{5}\\right) \\, dx = -2*X^{10} + \\frac{8}{5}*X^6 + \\frac{9}{5}*X^2 + C\n\\]\n\nLet's verify this calculation using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate\n\n# Define the variable and the function\nX = symbols('X')\nfunction = -20*X**9 + 48*X**5/5 + 18*X/5\n\n# Perform the integration\nintegral = integrate(function, X)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(integral)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we can confirm the result and provide the final answer.",
    "The code output confirms the integration results we derived manually. The indefinite integral of the function \\(-20*X**9 + \\frac{48*X**5}{5} + \\frac{18*X}{5}\\) is:\n\n\\[\n-2*X^{10} + \\frac{8}{5}*X^6 + \\frac{9}{5}*X^2 + C\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(C\\) is the constant of integration.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-2*X**10 + 8*X**6/5 + 9*X**2/5 + C>>>"
