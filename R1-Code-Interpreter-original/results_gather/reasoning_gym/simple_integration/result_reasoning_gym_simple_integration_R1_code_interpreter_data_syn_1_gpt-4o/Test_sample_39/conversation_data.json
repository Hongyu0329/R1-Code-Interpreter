    "To find the antiderivative of the polynomial function \\(-54*x**5 + 5*x**4 + 18*x**2 + 9\\), we need to integrate each term separately. The antiderivative of a polynomial term \\(a*x^n\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\int a*x^n \\, dx = \\frac{a}{n+1}*x^{n+1} + C\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(C\\) is the constant of integration.\n\nLet's apply this rule to each term in the polynomial:\n\n1. For the term \\(-54*x**5\\), the antiderivative is:\n   \\[\n   \\int -54*x^5 \\, dx = \\frac{-54}{5+1}*x^{5+1} = -9*x^6\n   \\]\n\n2. For the term \\(5*x**4\\), the antiderivative is:\n   \\[\n   \\int 5*x^4 \\, dx = \\frac{5}{4+1}*x^{4+1} = x^5\n   \\]\n\n3. For the term \\(18*x**2\\), the antiderivative is:\n   \\[\n   \\int 18*x^2 \\, dx = \\frac{18}{2+1}*x^{2+1} = 6*x^3\n   \\]\n\n4. For the constant term \\(9\\), the antiderivative is:\n   \\[\n   \\int 9 \\, dx = 9*x\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's combine all these results to get the antiderivative of the entire polynomial:\n\n\\[\n\\int (-54*x^5 + 5*x^4 + 18*x^2 + 9) \\, dx = -9*x^6 + x^5 + 6*x^3 + 9*x + C\n\\]\n\nTo ensure the calculations are correct, let's verify using Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate\n\n# Define the variable and the function\nx = symbols('x')\nfunction = -54*x**5 + 5*x**4 + 18*x**2 + 9\n\n# Calculate the antiderivative\nantiderivative = integrate(function, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(antiderivative)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we can confirm the result. \n\nThe final antiderivative of the given polynomial is:\n\n<<<-9*x**6 + x**5 + 6*x**3 + 9*x + C>>>",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matches the expected antiderivative of the polynomial function. The constant of integration \\(C\\) is typically not included in the computational output but is understood to be part of the antiderivative.\n\nTherefore, the final antiderivative of the given polynomial is:\n\n<<<-9*x**6 + x**5 + 6*x**3 + 9*x + C>>>"
