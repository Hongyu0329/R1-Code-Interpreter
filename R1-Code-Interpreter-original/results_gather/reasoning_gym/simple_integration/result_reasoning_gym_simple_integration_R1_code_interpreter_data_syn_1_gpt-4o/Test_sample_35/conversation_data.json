    "To solve the problem of finding the antiderivative of the function \\( \\frac{2}{3} - \\frac{35}{9}x^4 \\), we need to integrate each term separately with respect to \\( x \\).\n\n### Step-by-step Integration:\n\n1. **Integrate the constant term \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\):**\n   - The antiderivative of a constant \\( a \\) is \\( ax \\).\n   - Therefore, the antiderivative of \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) is \\(\\frac{2}{3}x\\).\n\n2. **Integrate the term \\(-\\frac{35}{9}x^4\\):**\n   - The antiderivative of \\( x^n \\) is \\(\\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}\\).\n   - Therefore, the antiderivative of \\(-\\frac{35}{9}x^4\\) is \\(-\\frac{35}{9} \\cdot \\frac{x^{5}}{5}\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results and add the constant of integration \\( C \\):**\n   - The combined antiderivative is \\(\\frac{2}{3}x - \\frac{35}{9} \\cdot \\frac{x^{5}}{5} + C\\).\n\nNow, let's compute the simplified form of the antiderivative using Python code.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the function to integrate\nfunction = 2/3 - 35/9 * x**4\n\n# Calculate the antiderivative\nantiderivative = integrate(function, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(antiderivative)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the simplified form of the antiderivative.",
    "The code output provides the antiderivative of the given function. Let's interpret the result:\n\nThe antiderivative of the function \\( \\frac{2}{3} - \\frac{35}{9}x^4 \\) is:\n\n\\[\n-0.777777777777778 \\cdot x^5 + 0.666666666666667 \\cdot x + C\n\\]\n\nThis can be simplified to:\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{7}{9} \\cdot x^5 + \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot x + C\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-\\frac{7}{9}x^5 + \\frac{2}{3}x + C>>>"
