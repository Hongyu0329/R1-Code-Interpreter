    "To find the antiderivative of the function \\(-63*X**8 + 35*X**4\\), we need to integrate each term separately with respect to \\(X\\).\n\nThe antiderivative of a term \\(a*X^n\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\int a*X^n \\, dx = \\frac{a}{n+1}*X^{n+1} + C\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(C\\) is the constant of integration.\n\nLet's apply this rule to each term in the expression:\n\n1. For the term \\(-63*X**8\\):\n   \\[\n   \\int -63*X**8 \\, dx = \\frac{-63}{8+1}*X^{8+1} = \\frac{-63}{9}*X^9 = -7*X^9\n   \\]\n\n2. For the term \\(35*X**4\\):\n   \\[\n   \\int 35*X**4 \\, dx = \\frac{35}{4+1}*X^{4+1} = \\frac{35}{5}*X^5 = 7*X^5\n   \\]\n\nNow, we combine these results and add the constant of integration \\(C\\):\n\n\\[\n\\int (-63*X**8 + 35*X**4) \\, dx = -7*X^9 + 7*X^5 + C\n\\]\n\nLet's verify this calculation using Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate\n\n# Define the variable and the function\nX = symbols('X')\nfunction = -63*X**8 + 35*X**4\n\n# Calculate the antiderivative\nantiderivative = integrate(function, X)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(antiderivative)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the antiderivative calculation. \n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<-7*X**9 + 7*X**5 + C>>>",
    "The code executed successfully and confirmed the antiderivative calculation. The result matches our manual computation. The constant of integration \\(C\\) is typically omitted in symbolic computation outputs, but it is understood to be part of the antiderivative.\n\nThe final answer, including the constant of integration, is:\n\n<<<-7*X**9 + 7*X**5 + C>>>"
