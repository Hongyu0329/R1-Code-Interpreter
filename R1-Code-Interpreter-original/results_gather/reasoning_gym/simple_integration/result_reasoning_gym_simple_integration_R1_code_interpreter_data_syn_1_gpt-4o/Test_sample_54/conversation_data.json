    "To find the antiderivative of the function \\(-18*X**8 - 6*X\\), we need to integrate each term separately with respect to \\(X\\).\n\n1. **Integrate \\(-18*X**8\\):**\n   - The antiderivative of \\(X**n\\) is \\(\\frac{X**(n+1)}{n+1}\\).\n   - For \\(-18*X**8\\), the antiderivative is \\(-18*\\frac{X**(8+1)}{8+1} = -18*\\frac{X**9}{9} = -2*X**9\\).\n\n2. **Integrate \\(-6*X\\):**\n   - The antiderivative of \\(X\\) is \\(\\frac{X**(1+1)}{1+1} = \\frac{X**2}{2}\\).\n   - For \\(-6*X\\), the antiderivative is \\(-6*\\frac{X**2}{2} = -3*X**2\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results and add the constant of integration \\(C\\):**\n   - The combined antiderivative is \\(-2*X**9 - 3*X**2 + C\\).\n\nLet's verify this by calculating the antiderivative using Python code.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate\n\n# Define the variable\nX = symbols('X')\n\n# Define the function\nfunction = -18*X**8 - 6*X\n\n# Calculate the antiderivative\nantiderivative = integrate(function, X)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(antiderivative)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the antiderivative calculation.",
