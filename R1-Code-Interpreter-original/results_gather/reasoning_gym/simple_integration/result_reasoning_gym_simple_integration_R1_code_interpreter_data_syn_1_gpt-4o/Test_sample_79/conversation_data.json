    "To evaluate the indefinite integral of the function \\( \\int (63*X**8 - \\frac{231*X**6}{5}) \\, dx \\), we need to integrate each term separately.\n\n### Step-by-step Integration:\n\n1. **Integrate the first term \\( 63*X**8 \\):**\n   - The integral of \\( X^n \\) is \\( \\frac{X^{n+1}}{n+1} \\).\n   - Therefore, the integral of \\( 63*X**8 \\) is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{63*X^{9}}{9} = 7*X**9\n     \\]\n\n2. **Integrate the second term \\( -\\frac{231*X**6}{5} \\):**\n   - The integral of \\( X^n \\) is \\( \\frac{X^{n+1}}{n+1} \\).\n   - Therefore, the integral of \\( -\\frac{231*X**6}{5} \\) is:\n     \\[\n     -\\frac{231}{5} * \\frac{X^{7}}{7} = -\\frac{231*X**7}{35}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   - The indefinite integral of the entire expression is:\n     \\[\n     7*X**9 - \\frac{231*X**7}{35} + C\n     \\]\n\nLet's compute the simplified form of the second term using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Python code to simplify the second term\nfrom sympy import symbols, simplify\n\nX = symbols('X')\nterm = -231*X**7/35\nsimplified_term = simplify(term)\nprint(simplified_term)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we can combine the results to form the final answer.",
    "The code output confirms that the simplified form of the second term \\(-\\frac{231*X**7}{35}\\) is \\(-\\frac{33*X**7}{5}\\).\n\nNow, combining the results from the integration:\n\n1. The integral of \\(63*X**8\\) is \\(7*X**9\\).\n2. The integral of \\(-\\frac{231*X**6}{5}\\) simplifies to \\(-\\frac{33*X**7}{5}\\).\n\nThus, the indefinite integral of the given expression is:\n\n\\[\n7*X**9 - \\frac{33*X**7}{5} + C\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(C\\) is the constant of integration.\n\n<<<7*X**9 - 33*X**7/5 + C>>>"
