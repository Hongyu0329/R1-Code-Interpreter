    "To find the antiderivative of the function \\( \\int \\left( \\frac{25}{3}*x^4 - \\frac{21}{2}*x^2 \\right) \\, dx \\), we need to integrate each term separately.\n\n### Step-by-step Integration:\n\n1. **Integrate the first term**: \\(\\frac{25}{3}*x^4\\)\n   - The antiderivative of \\(x^n\\) is \\(\\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}\\).\n   - For \\(\\frac{25}{3}*x^4\\), the antiderivative is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{25}{3} * \\frac{x^{4+1}}{4+1} = \\frac{25}{3} * \\frac{x^5}{5} = \\frac{25}{15}*x^5 = \\frac{5}{3}*x^5\n     \\]\n\n2. **Integrate the second term**: \\(-\\frac{21}{2}*x^2\\)\n   - The antiderivative of \\(x^n\\) is \\(\\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}\\).\n   - For \\(-\\frac{21}{2}*x^2\\), the antiderivative is:\n     \\[\n     -\\frac{21}{2} * \\frac{x^{2+1}}{2+1} = -\\frac{21}{2} * \\frac{x^3}{3} = -\\frac{21}{6}*x^3 = -\\frac{7}{2}*x^3\n     \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results and add the constant of integration \\(C\\)**:\n   - The antiderivative of the entire expression is:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{5}{3}*x^5 - \\frac{7}{2}*x^3 + C\n     \\]\n\nNow, let's confirm this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate\n\n# Define the variable and the function\nx = symbols('x')\nfunction = (25/3)*x**4 - (21/2)*x**2\n\n# Calculate the antiderivative\nantiderivative = integrate(function, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(antiderivative)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the antiderivative calculation.",
    "The code output confirms the antiderivative calculation. The expression \\(1.66666666666667*x^5 - 3.5*x^3\\) corresponds to the simplified fractions \\(\\frac{5}{3}*x^5 - \\frac{7}{2}*x^3\\).\n\nTherefore, the antiderivative of the given function is:\n\n<<<\\(\\frac{5}{3}*x^5 - \\frac{7}{2}*x^3 + C\\)>>>"
