    "To find the antiderivative of the function \\(-8*x**7 - 7*x**6 + 10*x**5/3\\), we will integrate each term separately with respect to \\(x\\).\n\n### Step-by-step Integration:\n\n1. **Integrate \\(-8*x**7\\):**\n   - The antiderivative of \\(x^n\\) is \\(\\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}\\).\n   - For \\(-8*x**7\\), the antiderivative is:\n     \\[\n     \\int -8*x**7 \\, dx = -8*\\frac{x^{7+1}}{7+1} = -8*\\frac{x^8}{8} = -x^8\n     \\]\n\n2. **Integrate \\(-7*x**6\\):**\n   - For \\(-7*x**6\\), the antiderivative is:\n     \\[\n     \\int -7*x**6 \\, dx = -7*\\frac{x^{6+1}}{6+1} = -7*\\frac{x^7}{7} = -x^7\n     \\]\n\n3. **Integrate \\(10*x**5/3\\):**\n   - For \\(10*x**5/3\\), the antiderivative is:\n     \\[\n     \\int \\frac{10}{3}*x**5 \\, dx = \\frac{10}{3}*\\frac{x^{5+1}}{5+1} = \\frac{10}{3}*\\frac{x^6}{6} = \\frac{10}{18}*x^6 = \\frac{5}{9}*x^6\n     \\]\n\n### Combine the Results:\nThe antiderivative of the entire function is the sum of the antiderivatives of each term:\n\\[\n-x^8 - x^7 + \\frac{5}{9}*x^6 + C\n\\]\nwhere \\(C\\) is the constant of integration.\n\nLet's verify and compute this using Python to ensure the calculations are correct.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the function\nfunction = -8*x**7 - 7*x**6 + 10*x**5/3\n\n# Calculate the antiderivative\nantiderivative = integrate(function, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(antiderivative)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will confirm the result and provide the final answer.",
    "The code output confirms our manual calculations. The antiderivative of the function \\(-8*x**7 - 7*x**6 + 10*x**5/3\\) is:\n\n\\[\n-x^8 - x^7 + \\frac{5}{9}*x^6 + C\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(C\\) is the constant of integration.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-x**8 - x**7 + 5*x**6/9 + C>>>"
