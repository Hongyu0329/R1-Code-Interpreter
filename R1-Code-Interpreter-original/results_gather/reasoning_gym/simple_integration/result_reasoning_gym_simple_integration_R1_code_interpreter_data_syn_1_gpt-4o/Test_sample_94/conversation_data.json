    "To find the indefinite integral of the function \\(-24*X**7 - 9*X**2\\), we need to integrate each term separately with respect to \\(X\\).\n\nThe general rule for integrating a term of the form \\(a*X**n\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\int a*X**n \\, dx = \\frac{a}{n+1}*X**(n+1) + C\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(C\\) is the constant of integration.\n\nLet's apply this rule to each term in the expression:\n\n1. For the term \\(-24*X**7\\):\n   - The integral is \\(\\frac{-24}{7+1}*X**(7+1) = \\frac{-24}{8}*X**8 = -3*X**8\\).\n\n2. For the term \\(-9*X**2\\):\n   - The integral is \\(\\frac{-9}{2+1}*X**(2+1) = \\frac{-9}{3}*X**3 = -3*X**3\\).\n\nNow, let's combine these results and include the constant of integration \\(C\\).\n\nThe indefinite integral of the given function is:\n\n\\[\n\\int (-24*X**7 - 9*X**2) \\, dx = -3*X**8 - 3*X**3 + C\n\\]\n\nLet's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate\n\n# Define the variable and the function\nX = symbols('X')\nfunction = -24*X**7 - 9*X**2\n\n# Calculate the indefinite integral\nindefinite_integral = integrate(function, X)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(indefinite_integral)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we can confirm the result.",
    "The code output confirms the manual calculation. The indefinite integral of the function \\(-24*X**7 - 9*X**2\\) with respect to \\(X\\) is:\n\n\\[\n-3*X**8 - 3*X**3 + C\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(C\\) is the constant of integration.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-3*X**8 - 3*X**3 + C>>>"
