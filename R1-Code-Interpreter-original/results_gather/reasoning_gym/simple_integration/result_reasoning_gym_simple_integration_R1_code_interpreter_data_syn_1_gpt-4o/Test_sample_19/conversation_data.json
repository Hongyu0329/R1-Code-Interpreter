    "To solve the indefinite integral ∫ (-216*x**(8/5) + 35*x**(6/8)) dx, we need to integrate each term separately.\n\n### Step-by-step Integration:\n\n1. **Integrate the first term: -216*x**(8/5)**\n   - The integral of x**n is (x**(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n   - For the term -216*x**(8/5), n = 8/5.\n   - The integral becomes: \n     \\[\n     \\int -216*x^{8/5} \\, dx = -216 * \\frac{x^{(8/5) + 1}}{(8/5) + 1} + C_1\n     \\]\n\n2. **Integrate the second term: 35*x**(6/8)**\n   - Simplify the exponent: 6/8 = 3/4.\n   - For the term 35*x**(3/4), n = 3/4.\n   - The integral becomes:\n     \\[\n     \\int 35*x^{3/4} \\, dx = 35 * \\frac{x^{(3/4) + 1}}{(3/4) + 1} + C_2\n     \\]\n\nNow, let's compute these integrals using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the expressions\nexpr1 = -216 * x**(8/5)\nexpr2 = 35 * x**(3/4)\n\n# Integrate the expressions\nintegral1 = integrate(expr1, x)\nintegral2 = integrate(expr2, x)\n\n# Print the results\nprint(integral1)\nprint(integral2)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, we will combine the results to form the final answer.",
    "The code output provides the integrated results for each term:\n\n1. The integral of \\(-216*x^{8/5}\\) is \\(-83.0769230769231*x^{2.6}\\).\n2. The integral of \\(35*x^{3/4}\\) is \\(20.0*x^{1.75}\\).\n\nNow, we combine these results to form the final indefinite integral:\n\n\\[\n\\int \\left(-216*x^{8/5} + 35*x^{6/8}\\right) \\, dx = -83.0769230769231*x^{2.6} + 20.0*x^{1.75} + C\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(C\\) is the constant of integration.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-83.0769230769231*x**2.6 + 20.0*x**1.75 + C>>>"
