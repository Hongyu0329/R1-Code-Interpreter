    "To evaluate the indefinite integral of the function \\(-20*x^3 - 2*x\\), we need to integrate each term separately. The integral of a polynomial term \\(a*x^n\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\int a*x^n \\, dx = \\frac{a}{n+1}*x^{n+1} + C\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(C\\) is the constant of integration.\n\nLet's apply this rule to each term in the expression:\n\n1. For the term \\(-20*x^3\\):\n   - The integral is \\(\\int -20*x^3 \\, dx = \\frac{-20}{3+1}*x^{3+1} = -5*x^4\\).\n\n2. For the term \\(-2*x\\):\n   - The integral is \\(\\int -2*x \\, dx = \\frac{-2}{1+1}*x^{1+1} = -x^2\\).\n\nNow, we combine these results and add the constant of integration \\(C\\):\n\n\\[\n\\int (-20*x^3 - 2*x) \\, dx = -5*x^4 - x^2 + C\n\\]\n\nLet's verify this calculation using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate\n\n# Define the variable and the function\nx = symbols('x')\nfunction = -20*x**3 - 2*x\n\n# Calculate the indefinite integral\nindefinite_integral = integrate(function, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(indefinite_integral)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we can confirm the result.",
    "The code output confirms our manual calculation. The indefinite integral of the function \\(-20*x^3 - 2*x\\) is:\n\n\\[\n-5*x^4 - x^2 + C\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(C\\) is the constant of integration.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-5*x**4 - x**2 + C>>>"
