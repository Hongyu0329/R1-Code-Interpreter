    "To evaluate the indefinite integral \\(\\int \\frac{154*x^3}{15} \\, dx\\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Simplify the integrand**: The integrand is \\(\\frac{154*x^3}{15}\\). We can factor out the constant \\(\\frac{154}{15}\\) from the integral, which gives us:\n   \\[\n   \\int \\frac{154*x^3}{15} \\, dx = \\frac{154}{15} \\int x^3 \\, dx\n   \\]\n\n2. **Integrate the function**: The integral of \\(x^3\\) with respect to \\(x\\) is \\(\\frac{x^4}{4}\\). Therefore, the integral becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{154}{15} \\int x^3 \\, dx = \\frac{154}{15} \\cdot \\frac{x^4}{4} = \\frac{154*x^4}{60}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the expression**: Simplify \\(\\frac{154*x^4}{60}\\) by reducing the fraction:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{154}{60} = \\frac{77}{30}\n   \\]\n   So, the integral becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{77*x^4}{30} + C\n   \\]\n   where \\(C\\) is the constant of integration.\n\nNow, let's verify the simplification and calculation using Python code.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate\n\n# Define the variable and the function\nx = symbols('x')\nfunction = 154*x**3/15\n\n# Perform the integration\nintegral_result = integrate(function, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(integral_result)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will obtain the result of the indefinite integral.",
    "The code executed successfully and confirmed the manual calculation. The indefinite integral of \\(\\int \\frac{154*x^3}{15} \\, dx\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{77*x^4}{30} + C\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(C\\) is the constant of integration.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\\(\\frac{77*x^4}{30} + C\\)>>>"
