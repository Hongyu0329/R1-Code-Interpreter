    "To find the antiderivative of the function \\(-\\frac{5}{2}*x^4 + 8*x^3 + \\frac{18}{7}*x^2\\), we need to integrate each term separately with respect to \\(x\\).\n\nThe antiderivative of a power function \\(a*x^n\\) is \\(\\frac{a}{n+1}*x^{n+1}\\).\n\nLet's apply this rule to each term:\n\n1. For the term \\(-\\frac{5}{2}*x^4\\):\n   - The antiderivative is \\(-\\frac{5}{2}*\\frac{1}{4+1}*x^{4+1} = -\\frac{5}{2}*\\frac{1}{5}*x^5 = -\\frac{5}{10}*x^5 = -\\frac{1}{2}*x^5\\).\n\n2. For the term \\(8*x^3\\):\n   - The antiderivative is \\(8*\\frac{1}{3+1}*x^{3+1} = 8*\\frac{1}{4}*x^4 = 2*x^4\\).\n\n3. For the term \\(\\frac{18}{7}*x^2\\):\n   - The antiderivative is \\(\\frac{18}{7}*\\frac{1}{2+1}*x^{2+1} = \\frac{18}{7}*\\frac{1}{3}*x^3 = \\frac{6}{7}*x^3\\).\n\nNow, let's combine these results and add the constant of integration \\(C\\).\n\nThe antiderivative of the given function is:\n\\[\n-\\frac{1}{2}*x^5 + 2*x^4 + \\frac{6}{7}*x^3 + C\n\\]\n\nLet's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the function\nfunction = -5/2*x**4 + 8*x**3 + 18/7*x**2\n\n# Calculate the antiderivative\nantiderivative = integrate(function, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(antiderivative)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will confirm the result.",
    "The code output confirms the manual calculation of the antiderivative. The antiderivative of the function \\(-\\frac{5}{2}*x^4 + 8*x^3 + \\frac{18}{7}*x^2\\) is:\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{1}{2}*x^5 + 2*x^4 + \\frac{6}{7}*x^3 + C\n\\]\n\nThe decimal representation of \\(\\frac{6}{7}\\) is approximately \\(0.857142857142857\\), which matches the output from the code.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-0.5*x**5 + 2.0*x**4 + 0.857142857142857*x**3 + C>>>"
