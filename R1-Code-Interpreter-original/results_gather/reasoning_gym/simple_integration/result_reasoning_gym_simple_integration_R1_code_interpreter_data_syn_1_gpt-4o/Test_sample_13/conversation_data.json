    "To find the antiderivative of the function \\( f(X) = 16*X**7 - \\frac{5*X**4}{3} + 10*X \\), we need to integrate each term separately.\n\n1. **Integrate \\( 16*X**7 \\):**\n   - The antiderivative of \\( X^n \\) is \\( \\frac{X^{n+1}}{n+1} \\).\n   - For \\( 16*X**7 \\), the antiderivative is \\( \\frac{16*X**8}{8} = 2*X**8 \\).\n\n2. **Integrate \\( -\\frac{5*X**4}{3} \\):**\n   - The antiderivative of \\( X^n \\) is \\( \\frac{X^{n+1}}{n+1} \\).\n   - For \\( -\\frac{5*X**4}{3} \\), the antiderivative is \\( -\\frac{5*X**5}{3*5} = -\\frac{X**5}{3} \\).\n\n3. **Integrate \\( 10*X \\):**\n   - The antiderivative of \\( X \\) is \\( \\frac{X^2}{2} \\).\n   - For \\( 10*X \\), the antiderivative is \\( \\frac{10*X**2}{2} = 5*X**2 \\).\n\nFinally, we combine these results and add the constant of integration \\( C \\).\n\nLet's compute this using Python to ensure accuracy:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate\n\n# Define the variable\nX = symbols('X')\n\n# Define the function\nf = 16*X**7 - 5*X**4/3 + 10*X\n\n# Calculate the antiderivative\nantiderivative = integrate(f, X)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(antiderivative)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will obtain the antiderivative expression.",
