    "To find the antiderivative of the function \\(-20*X**3 + 21*X**2 + \\frac{2*X}{7} + 7\\), we need to integrate each term separately with respect to \\(X\\).\n\n1. **Integrate \\(-20*X**3\\):**\n   - The antiderivative of \\(X^n\\) is \\(\\frac{X^{n+1}}{n+1}\\).\n   - For \\(-20*X**3\\), the antiderivative is \\(-20*\\frac{X^{3+1}}{3+1} = -20*\\frac{X**4}{4} = -5*X**4\\).\n\n2. **Integrate \\(21*X**2\\):**\n   - The antiderivative of \\(21*X**2\\) is \\(21*\\frac{X^{2+1}}{2+1} = 21*\\frac{X**3}{3} = 7*X**3\\).\n\n3. **Integrate \\(\\frac{2*X}{7}\\):**\n   - This can be rewritten as \\(\\frac{2}{7}*X\\).\n   - The antiderivative is \\(\\frac{2}{7}*\\frac{X^{1+1}}{1+1} = \\frac{2}{7}*\\frac{X**2}{2} = \\frac{1}{7}*X**2\\).\n\n4. **Integrate \\(7\\):**\n   - The antiderivative of a constant \\(7\\) is \\(7*X\\).\n\n5. **Combine all the terms and add the constant of integration \\(C\\):**\n   - The antiderivative is \\(-5*X**4 + 7*X**3 + \\frac{1}{7}*X**2 + 7*X + C\\).\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to compute this antiderivative.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate\n\n# Define the variable\nX = symbols('X')\n\n# Define the function\nfunction = -20*X**3 + 21*X**2 + 2*X/7 + 7\n\n# Compute the antiderivative\nantiderivative = integrate(function, X)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(antiderivative)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the antiderivative of the given function.",
