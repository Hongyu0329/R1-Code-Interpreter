    "To find the antiderivative of the function \\(-\\frac{35}{4}x^6 + 48x^5 - 45x^4 + 6\\), we need to integrate each term separately. The antiderivative of a polynomial term \\(ax^n\\) is \\(\\frac{a}{n+1}x^{n+1}\\).\n\nLet's break down the integration process:\n\n1. For the term \\(-\\frac{35}{4}x^6\\), the antiderivative is:\n   \\[\n   \\int -\\frac{35}{4}x^6 \\, dx = -\\frac{35}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{6+1}x^{6+1} = -\\frac{35}{28}x^7\n   \\]\n\n2. For the term \\(48x^5\\), the antiderivative is:\n   \\[\n   \\int 48x^5 \\, dx = 48 \\cdot \\frac{1}{5+1}x^{5+1} = 8x^6\n   \\]\n\n3. For the term \\(-45x^4\\), the antiderivative is:\n   \\[\n   \\int -45x^4 \\, dx = -45 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4+1}x^{4+1} = -9x^5\n   \\]\n\n4. For the constant term \\(6\\), the antiderivative is:\n   \\[\n   \\int 6 \\, dx = 6x\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's combine these results to form the complete antiderivative:\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{35}{28}x^7 + 8x^6 - 9x^5 + 6x + C\n\\]\n\nTo simplify \\(-\\frac{35}{28}x^7\\), we can reduce the fraction:\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{35}{28} = -\\frac{5}{4}\n\\]\n\nThus, the antiderivative becomes:\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{5}{4}x^7 + 8x^6 - 9x^5 + 6x + C\n\\]\n\nLet's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate\n\n# Define the variable and the function\nx = symbols('x')\nfunction = -35*x**6/4 + 48*x**5 - 45*x**4 + 6\n\n# Calculate the antiderivative\nantiderivative = integrate(function, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(antiderivative)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we can confirm the result. \n\n<<<-\\frac{5}{4}x^7 + 8x^6 - 9x^5 + 6x + C>>>",
    "The code output confirms the antiderivative calculation. The antiderivative of the given function \\(-\\frac{35}{4}x^6 + 48x^5 - 45x^4 + 6\\) is:\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{5}{4}x^7 + 8x^6 - 9x^5 + 6x + C\n\\]\n\nThis matches the result we derived manually. The constant of integration \\(C\\) is typically included in indefinite integrals, but it is not shown in the code output as it is a symbolic constant.\n\n<<<-\\frac{5}{4}x^7 + 8x^6 - 9x^5 + 6x + C>>>"
