    "To find the antiderivative of the function \\( f(x) = 63*x**8 - \\frac{32}{5}*x**7 + \\frac{1}{4} \\), we need to integrate each term separately.\n\n1. **Integrate the first term**: \\( 63*x**8 \\)\n   - The antiderivative of \\( x^n \\) is \\( \\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} \\).\n   - So, the antiderivative of \\( 63*x**8 \\) is \\( \\frac{63*x^{9}}{9} \\).\n\n2. **Integrate the second term**: \\( -\\frac{32}{5}*x**7 \\)\n   - The antiderivative of \\( x^n \\) is \\( \\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} \\).\n   - So, the antiderivative of \\( -\\frac{32}{5}*x**7 \\) is \\( -\\frac{32}{5}*\\frac{x^{8}}{8} \\).\n\n3. **Integrate the third term**: \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\)\n   - The antiderivative of a constant \\( c \\) is \\( c*x \\).\n   - So, the antiderivative of \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) is \\( \\frac{1}{4}*x \\).\n\nNow, let's compute these integrals and simplify the expression using Python code.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the function\nf = 63*x**8 - (32/5)*x**7 + 1/4\n\n# Calculate the antiderivative\nantiderivative = integrate(f, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(antiderivative)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will provide the antiderivative of the given function.",
    "The code has successfully computed the antiderivative of the given function. The antiderivative of \\( 63*x**8 - \\frac{32}{5}*x**7 + \\frac{1}{4} \\) is:\n\n\\[ 7.0*x**9 - 0.8*x**8 + 0.25*x + C \\]\n\nwhere \\( C \\) is the constant of integration.\n\n<<<7.0*x**9 - 0.8*x**8 + 0.25*x + C>>>"
