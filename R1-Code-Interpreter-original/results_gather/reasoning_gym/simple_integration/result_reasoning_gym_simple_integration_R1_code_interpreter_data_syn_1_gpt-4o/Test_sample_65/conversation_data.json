    "To find the antiderivative of the function \\( f(X) = 64*X**7 + 30*X**5 + 5 \\), we need to integrate each term separately. The antiderivative of a polynomial term \\( a*X^n \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\int a*X^n \\, dx = \\frac{a}{n+1}*X^{n+1} + C\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( C \\) is the constant of integration.\n\nLet's apply this rule to each term in the function:\n\n1. For the term \\( 64*X**7 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\int 64*X**7 \\, dx = \\frac{64}{7+1}*X^{7+1} = 8*X**8\n   \\]\n\n2. For the term \\( 30*X**5 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\int 30*X**5 \\, dx = \\frac{30}{5+1}*X^{5+1} = 5*X**6\n   \\]\n\n3. For the constant term \\( 5 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\int 5 \\, dx = 5*X\n   \\]\n\nNow, we can combine these results to get the antiderivative of the entire function:\n\n\\[\n\\int (64*X**7 + 30*X**5 + 5) \\, dx = 8*X**8 + 5*X**6 + 5*X + C\n\\]\n\nLet's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate\n\n# Define the variable and the function\nX = symbols('X')\nfunction = 64*X**7 + 30*X**5 + 5\n\n# Calculate the antiderivative\nantiderivative = integrate(function, X)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(antiderivative)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the antiderivative calculation.",
    "The code output confirms the antiderivative calculation. The antiderivative of the function \\( 64*X**7 + 30*X**5 + 5 \\) is:\n\n\\[\n8*X**8 + 5*X**6 + 5*X + C\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( C \\) is the constant of integration.\n\n<<<8*X**8 + 5*X**6 + 5*X + C>>>"
