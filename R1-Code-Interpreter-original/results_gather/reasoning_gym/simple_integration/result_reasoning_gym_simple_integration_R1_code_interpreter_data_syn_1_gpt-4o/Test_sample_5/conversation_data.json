    "To find the indefinite integral of the function \\( f(x) = 7*x^7 - 2*x \\), we need to integrate each term separately. The general rule for integrating a power function \\( x^n \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\int x^n \\, dx = \\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( C \\) is the constant of integration.\n\nLet's apply this rule to each term in the function:\n\n1. For the term \\( 7*x^7 \\):\n   - The integral is \\( \\int 7*x^7 \\, dx = 7 * \\frac{x^{7+1}}{7+1} = 7 * \\frac{x^8}{8} = \\frac{7}{8}*x^8 \\).\n\n2. For the term \\( -2*x \\):\n   - The integral is \\( \\int -2*x \\, dx = -2 * \\frac{x^{1+1}}{1+1} = -2 * \\frac{x^2}{2} = -x^2 \\).\n\nNow, we combine these results and add the constant of integration \\( C \\):\n\n\\[\n\\int (7*x^7 - 2*x) \\, dx = \\frac{7}{8}*x^8 - x^2 + C\n\\]\n\nLet's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate\n\n# Define the variable and the function\nx = symbols('x')\nfunction = 7*x**7 - 2*x\n\n# Calculate the indefinite integral\nindefinite_integral = integrate(function, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(indefinite_integral)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the result of the integration.",
    "The code output confirms the integration process. The indefinite integral of the function \\( 7*x^7 - 2*x \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{7}{8}*x^8 - x^2 + C\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( C \\) is the constant of integration.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\\(\\frac{7}{8}*x^8 - x^2 + C\\)>>>"
