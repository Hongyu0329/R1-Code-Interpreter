    "To find the indefinite integral of the function \\(-40*x**4 + 42*x**2\\), we need to integrate each term separately with respect to \\(x\\).\n\nThe general rule for integrating a term of the form \\(a*x^n\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\int a*x^n \\, dx = \\frac{a}{n+1}*x^{n+1} + C\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(C\\) is the constant of integration.\n\nLet's apply this rule to each term in the expression:\n\n1. For the term \\(-40*x**4\\):\n   - Here, \\(a = -40\\) and \\(n = 4\\).\n   - The integral is \\(\\frac{-40}{4+1}*x^{4+1} = \\frac{-40}{5}*x^5 = -8*x^5\\).\n\n2. For the term \\(42*x**2\\):\n   - Here, \\(a = 42\\) and \\(n = 2\\).\n   - The integral is \\(\\frac{42}{2+1}*x^{2+1} = \\frac{42}{3}*x^3 = 14*x^3\\).\n\nNow, we combine these results and add the constant of integration \\(C\\):\n\n\\[\n\\int (-40*x**4 + 42*x**2) \\, dx = -8*x^5 + 14*x^3 + C\n\\]\n\nLet's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate\n\n# Define the variable and the function\nx = symbols('x')\nfunction = -40*x**4 + 42*x**2\n\n# Calculate the indefinite integral\nindefinite_integral = integrate(function, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(indefinite_integral)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the indefinite integral of the given function and print the result.",
    "The code output confirms the manual calculation of the indefinite integral. The result of integrating \\(-40*x**4 + 42*x**2\\) with respect to \\(x\\) is:\n\n\\[\n-8*x^5 + 14*x^3 + C\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(C\\) is the constant of integration.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-8*x**5 + 14*x**3 + C>>>"
