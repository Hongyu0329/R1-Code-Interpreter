    "To find the indefinite integral of the function \\( \\int (100*X**9 + 90*X**8) \\, dx \\), we need to integrate each term separately. The general rule for integrating a term of the form \\( a*X^n \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\int a*X^n \\, dx = \\frac{a}{n+1}*X^{n+1} + C\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( C \\) is the constant of integration.\n\nLet's apply this rule to each term in the given function:\n\n1. For the term \\( 100*X**9 \\):\n   - The integral is \\( \\frac{100}{9+1}*X^{9+1} = 10*X^{10} \\).\n\n2. For the term \\( 90*X**8 \\):\n   - The integral is \\( \\frac{90}{8+1}*X^{8+1} = 10*X^{9} \\).\n\nNow, let's combine these results to get the indefinite integral of the entire function:\n\n\\[\n\\int (100*X**9 + 90*X**8) \\, dx = 10*X^{10} + 10*X^{9} + C\n\\]\n\nLet's verify this calculation using Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate\n\n# Define the variable\nX = symbols('X')\n\n# Define the function\nfunction = 100*X**9 + 90*X**8\n\n# Calculate the indefinite integral\nindefinite_integral = integrate(function, X)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(indefinite_integral)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the result of the indefinite integral.",
    "The code output confirms the calculation of the indefinite integral. The result of integrating the function \\( 100*X**9 + 90*X**8 \\) with respect to \\( X \\) is:\n\n\\[\n10*X^{10} + 10*X^{9} + C\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( C \\) is the constant of integration.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<10*X**10 + 10*X**9 + C>>>"
