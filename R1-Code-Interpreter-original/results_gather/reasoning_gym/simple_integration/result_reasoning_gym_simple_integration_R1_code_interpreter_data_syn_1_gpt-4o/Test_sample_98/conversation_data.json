    "To find the antiderivative of the function \\( f(X) = \\frac{54}{5}*X^{8} - 6*X^{7} + \\frac{2}{3}*X^{5} + 18*X^{2} - 6 \\), we need to integrate each term separately. The antiderivative of a polynomial term \\( a*X^n \\) is given by \\( \\frac{a}{n+1}*X^{n+1} \\).\n\nLet's break down the integration process for each term:\n\n1. For the term \\( \\frac{54}{5}*X^{8} \\), the antiderivative is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{54}{5}*\\frac{1}{8+1}*X^{9} = \\frac{54}{45}*X^{9} = \\frac{6}{5}*X^{9}\n   \\]\n\n2. For the term \\( -6*X^{7} \\), the antiderivative is:\n   \\[\n   -6*\\frac{1}{7+1}*X^{8} = -\\frac{6}{8}*X^{8} = -\\frac{3}{4}*X^{8}\n   \\]\n\n3. For the term \\( \\frac{2}{3}*X^{5} \\), the antiderivative is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{3}*\\frac{1}{5+1}*X^{6} = \\frac{2}{18}*X^{6} = \\frac{1}{9}*X^{6}\n   \\]\n\n4. For the term \\( 18*X^{2} \\), the antiderivative is:\n   \\[\n   18*\\frac{1}{2+1}*X^{3} = 6*X^{3}\n   \\]\n\n5. For the constant term \\( -6 \\), the antiderivative is:\n   \\[\n   -6*X\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's combine all these results and include the constant of integration \\( C \\).\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate\n\nX = symbols('X')\nf = (54/5)*X**8 - 6*X**7 + (2/3)*X**5 + 18*X**2 - 6\nantiderivative = integrate(f, X)\nprint(antiderivative)\n```\n\nThe code will compute the antiderivative of the given function. Let's execute it to find the result.",
    "The code has successfully computed the antiderivative of the given function. The result is:\n\n\\[\n1.2*X^{9} - 0.75*X^{8} + 0.111111111111111*X^{6} + 6.0*X^{3} - 6.0*X + C\n\\]\n\nThis matches our manual calculations, where each term was integrated separately. The constant \\( C \\) represents the constant of integration, which is always added when finding an indefinite integral.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<1.2*X**9 - 0.75*X**8 + 0.111111111111111*X**6 + 6.0*X**3 - 6.0*X + C>>>"
