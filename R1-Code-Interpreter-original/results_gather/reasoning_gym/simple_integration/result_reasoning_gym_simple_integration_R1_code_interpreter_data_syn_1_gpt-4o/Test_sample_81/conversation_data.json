    "To solve the problem of finding the antiderivative of the function \\( \\int (7 - 72*X**8) \\, dx \\), we need to integrate each term separately.\n\n1. **Integrate the constant term 7:**\n   - The antiderivative of a constant \\( a \\) is \\( a*X \\).\n   - Therefore, the antiderivative of 7 is \\( 7*X \\).\n\n2. **Integrate the term \\(-72*X**8\\):**\n   - The antiderivative of \\( X^n \\) is \\( \\frac{X^{n+1}}{n+1} \\).\n   - Therefore, the antiderivative of \\(-72*X**8\\) is \\(-72*\\frac{X^{8+1}}{8+1} = -72*\\frac{X**9}{9}\\).\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   - The antiderivative of the entire expression is \\( 7*X - 72*\\frac{X**9}{9} + C \\), where \\( C \\) is the constant of integration.\n\nLet's compute the simplified form of the expression using Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the coefficients and powers\na = 7\nb = -72\nn = 8\n\n# Calculate the antiderivative\nantiderivative_constant = a\nantiderivative_x_term = b / (n + 1)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"{antiderivative_constant}*X + {antiderivative_x_term}*X**{n+1} + C\")\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will obtain the simplified form of the antiderivative.",
    "The code output provides the simplified form of the antiderivative. Let's summarize the result:\n\nThe antiderivative of the function \\( \\int (7 - 72*X**8) \\, dx \\) is:\n\n\\[ 7*X - 8.0*X**9 + C \\]\n\nwhere \\( C \\) is the constant of integration.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<7*X - 8.0*X**9 + C>>>"
