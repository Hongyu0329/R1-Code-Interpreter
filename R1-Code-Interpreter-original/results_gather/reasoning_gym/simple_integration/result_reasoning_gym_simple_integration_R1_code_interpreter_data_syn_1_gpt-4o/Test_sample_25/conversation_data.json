    "To evaluate the indefinite integral of the function \\(-36*X**8 + \\frac{49*X**6}{6}\\), we need to integrate each term separately with respect to \\(X\\).\n\nThe integral of a power function \\(a*X^n\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\int a*X^n \\, dx = \\frac{a}{n+1}*X^{n+1} + C\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(C\\) is the constant of integration.\n\nLet's apply this rule to each term in the given function:\n\n1. For the term \\(-36*X**8\\):\n   \\[\n   \\int -36*X**8 \\, dx = \\frac{-36}{8+1}*X^{8+1} = \\frac{-36}{9}*X^9 = -4*X^9\n   \\]\n\n2. For the term \\(\\frac{49*X**6}{6}\\):\n   \\[\n   \\int \\frac{49*X**6}{6} \\, dx = \\frac{49/6}{6+1}*X^{6+1} = \\frac{49}{42}*X^7 = \\frac{7}{6}*X^7\n   \\]\n\nNow, we combine the results of these integrals and add the constant of integration \\(C\\):\n\n\\[\n\\int \\left(-36*X**8 + \\frac{49*X**6}{6}\\right) \\, dx = -4*X^9 + \\frac{7}{6}*X^7 + C\n\\]\n\nLet's verify this calculation using Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate\n\n# Define the variable and the function\nX = symbols('X')\nfunction = -36*X**8 + 49*X**6/6\n\n# Perform the integration\nintegral_result = integrate(function, X)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(integral_result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the integration result.",
    "The code output confirms our manual integration process. The indefinite integral of the function \\(-36*X**8 + \\frac{49*X**6}{6}\\) is:\n\n\\[\n-4*X^9 + \\frac{7}{6}*X^7 + C\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(C\\) is the constant of integration.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-4*X**9 + 7*X**7/6 + C>>>"
