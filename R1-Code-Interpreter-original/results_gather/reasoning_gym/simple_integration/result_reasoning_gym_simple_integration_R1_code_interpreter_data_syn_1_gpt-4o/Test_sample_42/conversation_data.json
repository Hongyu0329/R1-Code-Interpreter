    "To solve the problem of finding the antiderivative of the function \\(-64*X^{7/3} + 15*X^2\\), we need to integrate each term separately with respect to \\(X\\).\n\n### Step-by-step Integration:\n\n1. **Integrate \\(-64*X^{7/3}\\):**\n   - The antiderivative of \\(X^n\\) is \\(\\frac{X^{n+1}}{n+1}\\).\n   - For \\(-64*X^{7/3}\\), \\(n = \\frac{7}{3}\\).\n   - The antiderivative is:\n     \\[\n     -64 \\cdot \\frac{X^{7/3 + 1}}{7/3 + 1} = -64 \\cdot \\frac{X^{10/3}}{10/3} = -64 \\cdot \\frac{3}{10} \\cdot X^{10/3}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Integrate \\(15*X^2\\):**\n   - For \\(15*X^2\\), \\(n = 2\\).\n   - The antiderivative is:\n     \\[\n     15 \\cdot \\frac{X^{2+1}}{2+1} = 15 \\cdot \\frac{X^3}{3} = 5 \\cdot X^3\n     \\]\n\n3. **Combine the results and add the constant of integration \\(C\\):**\n   - The combined antiderivative is:\n     \\[\n     -64 \\cdot \\frac{3}{10} \\cdot X^{10/3} + 5 \\cdot X^3 + C\n     \\]\n\nNow, let's compute the numerical coefficients using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the coefficients for the antiderivative\ncoefficient_1 = -64 * (3/10)\ncoefficient_2 = 5\n\n# Print the coefficients\nprint(coefficient_1, coefficient_2)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the coefficients.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the coefficients for the antiderivative. Now, we can write the final antiderivative expression using these coefficients.\n\nThe antiderivative of the function \\(-64*X^{7/3} + 15*X^2\\) is:\n\n\\[\n-19.2 \\cdot X^{10/3} + 5 \\cdot X^3 + C\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(C\\) is the constant of integration.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-19.2*X**(10/3) + 5*X**3 + C>>>"
