    "To evaluate the indefinite integral of the function \\(-8*X**4 - 24*X**2\\) with respect to \\(X\\), we need to integrate each term separately.\n\nThe integral of a power function \\(a*X^n\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\int a*X^n \\, dx = \\frac{a}{n+1}*X^{n+1} + C\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(C\\) is the constant of integration.\n\nLet's apply this rule to each term in the expression:\n\n1. For the term \\(-8*X**4\\):\n   - The integral is \\(\\int -8*X**4 \\, dx = \\frac{-8}{4+1}*X^{4+1} = -\\frac{8}{5}*X**5\\).\n\n2. For the term \\(-24*X**2\\):\n   - The integral is \\(\\int -24*X**2 \\, dx = \\frac{-24}{2+1}*X^{2+1} = -8*X**3\\).\n\nNow, we combine these results and add the constant of integration \\(C\\):\n\n\\[\n\\int (-8*X**4 - 24*X**2) \\, dx = -\\frac{8}{5}*X**5 - 8*X**3 + C\n\\]\n\nLet's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate\n\n# Define the variable\nX = symbols('X')\n\n# Define the function to integrate\nfunction = -8*X**4 - 24*X**2\n\n# Perform the integration\nintegral_result = integrate(function, X)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(integral_result)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the integration result.",
    "The code output confirms the integration result. The indefinite integral of the function \\(-8*X**4 - 24*X**2\\) with respect to \\(X\\) is:\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{8}{5}*X**5 - 8*X**3 + C\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(C\\) is the constant of integration.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-8*X**5/5 - 8*X**3 + C>>>"
