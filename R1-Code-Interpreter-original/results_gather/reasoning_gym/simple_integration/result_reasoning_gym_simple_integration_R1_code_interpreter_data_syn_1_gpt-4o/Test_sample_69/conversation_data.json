    "To find the indefinite integral of the function \\(-8*X^{5/3} + 38*X^3\\), we need to integrate each term separately.\n\nThe general rule for integrating a power of \\(X\\) is:\n\\[\n\\int X^n \\, dx = \\frac{X^{n+1}}{n+1} + C\n\\]\nwhere \\(C\\) is the constant of integration.\n\nLet's apply this rule to each term:\n\n1. For the term \\(-8*X^{5/3}\\):\n   - The exponent is \\(5/3\\), so \\(n = 5/3\\).\n   - The integral is:\n     \\[\n     \\int -8*X^{5/3} \\, dx = -8 \\cdot \\frac{X^{5/3 + 1}}{5/3 + 1} = -8 \\cdot \\frac{X^{8/3}}{8/3} = -8 \\cdot \\frac{3}{8} \\cdot X^{8/3} = -3*X^{8/3}\n     \\]\n\n2. For the term \\(38*X^3\\):\n   - The exponent is \\(3\\), so \\(n = 3\\).\n   - The integral is:\n     \\[\n     \\int 38*X^3 \\, dx = 38 \\cdot \\frac{X^{3+1}}{3+1} = 38 \\cdot \\frac{X^4}{4} = 9.5*X^4\n     \\]\n\nNow, we combine the results of the integrals and add the constant of integration \\(C\\):\n\\[\n\\int \\left(-8*X^{5/3} + 38*X^3\\right) \\, dx = -3*X^{8/3} + 9.5*X^4 + C\n\\]\n\nLet's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate\n\n# Define the variable\nX = symbols('X')\n\n# Define the function to integrate\nfunction = -8*X**(5/3) + 38*X**3\n\n# Perform the integration\nintegral = integrate(function, X)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(integral)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we can confirm the result. \n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<-3*X**(8/3) + 9.5*X**4 + C>>>",
    "The code output confirms the integration result, but it presents the terms in a slightly different format. Let's interpret the output:\n\n1. The term \\(19*X^4/2\\) is equivalent to \\(9.5*X^4\\), which matches our manual calculation.\n\n2. The term \\(-3.0*X^{2.66666666666667}\\) is equivalent to \\(-3*X^{8/3}\\), as \\(8/3\\) is approximately \\(2.66666666666667\\).\n\nThus, the code output is consistent with our manual integration. The final answer, including the constant of integration \\(C\\), is:\n\n<<<-3*X**(8/3) + 9.5*X**4 + C>>>"
