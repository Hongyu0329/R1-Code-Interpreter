    "To solve the problem of finding the antiderivative of the function \\( f(X) = 2*X**5 - 40*X**3 \\), we need to integrate each term separately.\n\nThe antiderivative of a power function \\( X^n \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\int X^n \\, dx = \\frac{X^{n+1}}{n+1} + C\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( C \\) is the constant of integration.\n\nLet's apply this rule to each term in the function:\n\n1. For the term \\( 2*X**5 \\):\n   - The antiderivative is \\( \\frac{2*X^{5+1}}{5+1} = \\frac{2*X**6}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}*X**6 \\).\n\n2. For the term \\( -40*X**3 \\):\n   - The antiderivative is \\( \\frac{-40*X^{3+1}}{3+1} = \\frac{-40*X**4}{4} = -10*X**4 \\).\n\nNow, we combine these results and add the constant of integration \\( C \\):\n\n\\[\n\\int (2*X**5 - 40*X**3) \\, dx = \\frac{1}{3}*X**6 - 10*X**4 + C\n\\]\n\nLet's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate\n\n# Define the variable\nX = symbols('X')\n\n# Define the function\nfunction = 2*X**5 - 40*X**3\n\n# Calculate the antiderivative\nantiderivative = integrate(function, X)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(antiderivative)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the antiderivative calculation.",
    "The code output confirms the antiderivative calculation. The antiderivative of the function \\( 2*X**5 - 40*X**3 \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3}*X**6 - 10*X**4 + C\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( C \\) is the constant of integration.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\\(\\frac{1}{3}*X**6 - 10*X**4 + C\\)>>>"
