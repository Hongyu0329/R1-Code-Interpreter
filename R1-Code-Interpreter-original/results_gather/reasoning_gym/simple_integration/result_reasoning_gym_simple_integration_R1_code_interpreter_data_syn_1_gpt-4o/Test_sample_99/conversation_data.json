    "To evaluate the indefinite integral of the function \\( f(X) = 20*X**9 - \\frac{144}{5}*X**8 + 35*X**4 \\), we need to integrate each term separately with respect to \\( X \\).\n\nThe general rule for integrating a term of the form \\( a*X^n \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\int a*X^n \\, dx = \\frac{a}{n+1}*X^{n+1} + C\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( C \\) is the constant of integration.\n\nLet's apply this rule to each term in the function:\n\n1. For the term \\( 20*X**9 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\int 20*X**9 \\, dx = \\frac{20}{9+1}*X^{9+1} = 2*X^{10}\n   \\]\n\n2. For the term \\( -\\frac{144}{5}*X**8 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\int -\\frac{144}{5}*X**8 \\, dx = -\\frac{144}{5}*\\frac{1}{8+1}*X^{8+1} = -\\frac{144}{45}*X^9 = -\\frac{32}{10}*X^9 = -\\frac{16}{5}*X^9\n   \\]\n\n3. For the term \\( 35*X**4 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\int 35*X**4 \\, dx = \\frac{35}{4+1}*X^{4+1} = 7*X^5\n   \\]\n\nNow, let's combine these results to form the integral of the entire function:\n\n\\[\n\\int (20*X**9 - \\frac{144}{5}*X**8 + 35*X**4) \\, dx = 2*X^{10} - \\frac{16}{5}*X^9 + 7*X^5 + C\n\\]\n\nLet's verify this calculation using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate\n\n# Define the variable and the function\nX = symbols('X')\nfunction = 20*X**9 - 144*X**8/5 + 35*X**4\n\n# Calculate the indefinite integral\nindefinite_integral = integrate(function, X)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(indefinite_integral)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the correctness of the manual integration process.",
    "The code output confirms the manual integration process. The indefinite integral of the function \\( 20*X**9 - \\frac{144}{5}*X**8 + 35*X**4 \\) is:\n\n\\[\n2*X^{10} - \\frac{16}{5}*X^9 + 7*X^5 + C\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( C \\) is the constant of integration.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<2*X**10 - 16*X**9/5 + 7*X**5 + C>>>"
