    "To find the antiderivative of the function \\(-16*x^7 + 10*x\\), we need to integrate each term separately. The general rule for integrating a term of the form \\(a*x^n\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\int a*x^n \\, dx = \\frac{a}{n+1}*x^{n+1} + C\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(C\\) is the constant of integration.\n\nLet's apply this rule to each term in the expression:\n\n1. For the term \\(-16*x^7\\):\n   - The antiderivative is \\(\\frac{-16}{7+1}*x^{7+1} = \\frac{-16}{8}*x^8 = -2*x^8\\).\n\n2. For the term \\(10*x\\):\n   - The antiderivative is \\(\\frac{10}{1+1}*x^{1+1} = \\frac{10}{2}*x^2 = 5*x^2\\).\n\nNow, we combine these results and add the constant of integration \\(C\\):\n\n\\[\n\\int (-16*x^7 + 10*x) \\, dx = -2*x^8 + 5*x^2 + C\n\\]\n\nLet's verify this calculation using Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate\n\n# Define the variable and the function\nx = symbols('x')\nfunction = -16*x**7 + 10*x\n\n# Calculate the antiderivative\nantiderivative = integrate(function, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(antiderivative)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the antiderivative calculation.",
    "The code output confirms that the antiderivative of the function \\(-16*x^7 + 10*x\\) is indeed \\(-2*x^8 + 5*x^2\\). The constant of integration \\(C\\) is typically included in indefinite integrals, but it is not shown in the symbolic computation output.\n\nTherefore, the final answer, including the constant of integration, is:\n\n<<<-2*x**8 + 5*x**2 + C>>>"
