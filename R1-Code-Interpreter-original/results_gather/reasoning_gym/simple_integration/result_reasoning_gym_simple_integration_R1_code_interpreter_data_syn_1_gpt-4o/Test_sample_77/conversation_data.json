    "To find the indefinite integral of the function \\(-\\frac{45}{4}*x^8 - 104*x^7 + 1\\), we need to integrate each term separately. The general rule for integrating a term of the form \\(a*x^n\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\int a*x^n \\, dx = \\frac{a}{n+1}*x^{n+1} + C\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(C\\) is the constant of integration.\n\nLet's apply this rule to each term in the function:\n\n1. For the term \\(-\\frac{45}{4}*x^8\\):\n   - The integral is \\(-\\frac{45}{4}*\\frac{1}{8+1}*x^{8+1} = -\\frac{45}{36}*x^9 = -\\frac{5}{4}*x^9\\).\n\n2. For the term \\(-104*x^7\\):\n   - The integral is \\(-104*\\frac{1}{7+1}*x^{7+1} = -104*\\frac{1}{8}*x^8 = -13*x^8\\).\n\n3. For the constant term \\(1\\):\n   - The integral is \\(1*x + C\\).\n\nNow, let's combine these results to get the indefinite integral of the entire function. We can use Python to perform these calculations and verify the results.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate\n\n# Define the variable and the function\nx = symbols('x')\nfunction = -45/4*x**8 - 104*x**7 + 1\n\n# Calculate the indefinite integral\nindefinite_integral = integrate(function, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(indefinite_integral)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the indefinite integral.",
    "The code execution has provided the indefinite integral of the function. Let's interpret the result:\n\nThe indefinite integral of the function \\(-\\frac{45}{4}*x^8 - 104*x^7 + 1\\) is:\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{5}{4}*x^9 - 13*x^8 + x + C\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(C\\) is the constant of integration.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-1.25*x**9 - 13.0*x**8 + 1.0*x + C>>>"
