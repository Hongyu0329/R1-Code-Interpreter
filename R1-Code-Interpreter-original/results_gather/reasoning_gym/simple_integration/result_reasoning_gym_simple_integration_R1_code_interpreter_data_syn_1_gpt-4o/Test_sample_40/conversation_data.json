    "To find the indefinite integral of the function \\(-6*x**5 - 24*x**3\\), we need to integrate each term separately. The general rule for integrating a term of the form \\(a*x^n\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\int a*x^n \\, dx = \\frac{a}{n+1}*x^{n+1} + C\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(C\\) is the constant of integration.\n\nLet's apply this rule to each term in the expression:\n\n1. For the term \\(-6*x**5\\):\n   - The integral is \\(\\int -6*x^5 \\, dx = \\frac{-6}{5+1}*x^{5+1} = -\\frac{6}{6}*x^6 = -x^6\\).\n\n2. For the term \\(-24*x**3\\):\n   - The integral is \\(\\int -24*x^3 \\, dx = \\frac{-24}{3+1}*x^{3+1} = -\\frac{24}{4}*x^4 = -6*x^4\\).\n\nNow, we combine the results of these integrals and add the constant of integration \\(C\\):\n\n\\[\n\\int (-6*x**5 - 24*x**3) \\, dx = -x^6 - 6*x^4 + C\n\\]\n\nLet's verify this calculation using Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate\n\n# Define the variable and the function\nx = symbols('x')\nfunction = -6*x**5 - 24*x**3\n\n# Calculate the indefinite integral\nindefinite_integral = integrate(function, x)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(indefinite_integral)\n```\n\nOnce the code is executed, it will confirm the result of the integration.",
    "The code output confirms the integration result. The indefinite integral of the function \\(-6*x**5 - 24*x**3\\) is:\n\n\\[\n-x^6 - 6*x^4 + C\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(C\\) is the constant of integration.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<-x**6 - 6*x**4 + C>>>"
