    "To find the antiderivative of the function \\( f(X) = 80*X**9 - 90*X**8 + \\frac{2*X}{3} + 1 \\), we need to integrate each term separately with respect to \\( X \\).\n\n1. **Integrate \\( 80*X**9 \\):**\n   - The antiderivative of \\( X^n \\) is \\( \\frac{X^{n+1}}{n+1} \\).\n   - For \\( 80*X**9 \\), the antiderivative is \\( \\frac{80*X^{10}}{10} = 8*X^{10} \\).\n\n2. **Integrate \\( -90*X**8 \\):**\n   - The antiderivative of \\( X^n \\) is \\( \\frac{X^{n+1}}{n+1} \\).\n   - For \\( -90*X**8 \\), the antiderivative is \\( \\frac{-90*X^{9}}{9} = -10*X^{9} \\).\n\n3. **Integrate \\( \\frac{2*X}{3} \\):**\n   - This can be rewritten as \\( \\frac{2}{3}*X \\).\n   - The antiderivative of \\( X \\) is \\( \\frac{X^2}{2} \\).\n   - For \\( \\frac{2}{3}*X \\), the antiderivative is \\( \\frac{2}{3}*\\frac{X^2}{2} = \\frac{X^2}{3} \\).\n\n4. **Integrate \\( 1 \\):**\n   - The antiderivative of a constant \\( c \\) is \\( c*X \\).\n   - For \\( 1 \\), the antiderivative is \\( X \\).\n\nNow, let's combine all these results and add the constant of integration \\( C \\).\n\nThe antiderivative of the given function is:\n\\[ 8*X^{10} - 10*X^{9} + \\frac{X^2}{3} + X + C \\]\n\nLet's verify this by writing a Python script to compute the antiderivative:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, integrate\n\n# Define the variable\nX = symbols('X')\n\n# Define the function\nf = 80*X**9 - 90*X**8 + 2*X/3 + 1\n\n# Compute the antiderivative\nantiderivative = integrate(f, X)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(antiderivative)\n```\n\nThis code will compute the antiderivative of the function using symbolic integration.
