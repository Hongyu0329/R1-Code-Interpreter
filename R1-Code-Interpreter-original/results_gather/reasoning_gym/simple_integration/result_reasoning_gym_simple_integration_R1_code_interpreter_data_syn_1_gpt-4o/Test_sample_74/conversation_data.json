    "To find the antiderivative of the function \\(-8*x**7 - \\frac{395}{7}*x**4 + 5*x\\), we need to integrate each term separately. The antiderivative of a polynomial term \\(a*x^n\\) is \\(\\frac{a}{n+1}*x^{n+1}\\).\n\nLet's break down the integration process:\n\n1. **Integrate \\(-8*x**7\\):**\n   - The antiderivative is \\(-8*\\frac{1}{7+1}*x^{7+1} = -8*\\frac{1}{8}*x^8 = -x^8\\).\n\n2. **Integrate \\(-\\frac{395}{7}*x**4\\):**\n   - The antiderivative is \\(-\\frac{395}{7}*\\frac{1}{4+1}*x^{4+1} = -\\frac{395}{7}*\\frac{1}{5}*x^5 = -\\frac{395}{35}*x^5\\).\n\n3. **Integrate \\(5*x\\):**\n   - The antiderivative is \\(5*\\frac{1}{1+1}*x^{1+1} = 5*\\frac{1}{2}*x^2 = \\frac{5}{2}*x^2\\).\n\nNow, let's combine these results and include the constant of integration \\(C\\):\n\nThe antiderivative of the given function is:\n\\[\n-x^8 - \\frac{395}{35}*x^5 + \\frac{5}{2}*x^2 + C\n\\]\n\nTo ensure the calculations are correct, let's compute the numerical coefficients using Python:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the coefficients\na1 = -8 / 8\na2 = -395 / (7 * 5)\na3 = 5 / 2\n\n# Print the results\nprint(a1, a2, a3)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the coefficients.",
    "The code execution confirms the coefficients for each term in the antiderivative. Let's summarize the results:\n\n1. The coefficient for \\(x^8\\) is \\(-1.0\\).\n2. The coefficient for \\(x^5\\) is approximately \\(-11.285714285714286\\).\n3. The coefficient for \\(x^2\\) is \\(2.5\\).\n\nThus, the antiderivative of the function \\(-8*x**7 - \\frac{395}{7}*x**4 + 5*x\\) is:\n\n\\[\n-x^8 - 11.285714285714286*x^5 + 2.5*x^2 + C\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(C\\) is the constant of integration.\n\n<<<-x**8 - 11.285714285714286*x**5 + 2.5*x**2 + C>>>"
