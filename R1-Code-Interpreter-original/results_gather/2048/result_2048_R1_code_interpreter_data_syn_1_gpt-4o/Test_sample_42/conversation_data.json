  "question": "In an 4x4 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (4, 4) using the sequence 'urdu':\n0, 0, 4, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 4, 0\n2, 0, 16, 16\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the numbers in the grid according to the given sequence of moves: 'urdu'. The initial grid is:\n\n```\n0, 0, 4, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 4, 0\n2, 0, 16, 16\n```\n\nThe number in position (4, 4) is 16. We will move this number according to the sequence 'urdu':\n\n1. **Move 'u' (up):** The number 16 at position (4, 4) moves up to position (3, 4). Since there is another 16 at (3, 4), they combine to form 32. The grid becomes:\n   ```\n   0, 0, 4, 0\n   0, 0, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 4, 32\n   2, 0, 0, 0\n   ```\n\n2. **Move 'r' (right):** The number 32 at position (3, 4) cannot move right as it is already at the rightmost column. The grid remains unchanged:\n   ```\n   0, 0, 4, 0\n   0, 0, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 4, 32\n   2, 0, 0, 0\n   ```\n\n3. **Move 'd' (down):** The number 32 at position (3, 4) moves down to position (4, 4). The grid becomes:\n   ```\n   0, 0, 4, 0\n   0, 0, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 4, 0\n   2, 0, 0, 32\n   ```\n\n4. **Move 'u' (up):** The number 32 at position (4, 4) moves up to position (3, 4). The grid becomes:\n   ```\n   0, 0, 4, 0\n   0, 0, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 4, 32\n   2, 0, 0, 0\n   ```\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in Python to verify the final state of the grid.\n\n```python\ndef move_up(grid):\n    for col in range(4):\n        for row in range(1, 4):\n            if grid[row][col] != 0:\n                for move_row in range(row, 0, -1):\n                    if grid[move_row-1][col] == 0:\n                        grid[move_row-1][col] = grid[move_row][col]\n                        grid[move_row][col] = 0\n                    elif grid[move_row-1][col] == grid[move_row][col]:\n                        grid[move_row-1][col] *= 2\n                        grid[move_row][col] = 0\n                        break\n                    else:\n                        break\n    return grid\n\ndef move_down(grid):\n    for col in range(4):\n        for row in range(2, -1, -1):\n            if grid[row][col] != 0:\n                for move_row in range(row, 3):\n                    if grid[move_row+1][col] == 0:\n                        grid[move_row+1][col] = grid[move_row][col]\n                        grid[move_row][col] = 0\n                    elif grid[move_row+1][col] == grid[move_row][col]:\n                        grid[move_row+1][col] *= 2\n                        grid[move_row][col] = 0\n                        break\n                    else:\n                        break\n    return grid\n\ndef move_left(grid):\n    for row in range(4):\n        for col in range(1, 4):\n            if grid[row][col] != 0:\n                for move_col in range(col, 0, -1):\n                    if grid[row][move_col-1] == 0:\n                        grid[row][move_col-1] = grid[row][move_col]\n                        grid[row][move_col] = 0\n                    elif grid[row][move_col-1] == grid[row][move_col]:\n                        grid[row][move_col-1] *= 2\n                        grid[row][move_col] = 0\n                        break\n                    else:\n                        break\n    return grid\n\ndef move_right(grid):\n    for row in range(4):\n        for col in range(2, -1, -1):\n            if grid[row][col] != 0:\n                for move_col in range(col, 3):\n                    if grid[row][move_col+1] == 0:\n                        grid[row][move_col+1] = grid[row][move_col]\n                        grid[row][move_col] = 0\n                    elif grid[row][move_col+1] == grid[row][move_col]:\n                        grid[row][move_col+1] *= 2\n                        grid[row][move_col] = 0\n                        break\n                    else:\n                        break\n    return grid\n\n# Initial grid\ngrid = [\n    [0, 0, 4, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 4, 0],\n    [2, 0, 16, 16]\n]\n\n# Sequence of moves\nmoves = 'urdu'\n\n# Apply each move\nfor move in moves:\n    if move == 'u':\n        grid = move_up(grid)\n    elif move == 'd':\n        grid = move_down(grid)\n    elif move == 'l':\n        grid = move_left(grid)\n    elif move == 'r':\n        grid = move_right(grid)\n\nprint(grid)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final state of the grid.",
