  "question": "In an 3x3 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (1, 1) using the sequence 'lrl':\n0, 0, 8\n32, 32, 32\n0, 0, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (1, 1) according to the sequence 'lrl'. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   ```\n   0, 0, 8\n   32, 32, 32\n   0, 0, 0\n   ```\n\n2. **Initial Position of the Number:**\n   - The number at position (1, 1) is 32.\n\n3. **Move Sequence:**\n   - 'l': Move left\n   - 'r': Move right\n   - 'l': Move left\n\n4. **Simulate the Moves:**\n   - **Move 'l' (left):** The number at (1, 1) moves to (1, 0). Since (1, 0) is 32, they combine to form 64.\n   - **Move 'r' (right):** The number at (1, 0) moves to (1, 1). Since (1, 1) is now 0, it remains 64.\n   - **Move 'l' (left):** The number at (1, 1) moves to (1, 0). Since (1, 0) is now 0, it remains 64.\n\n5. **Final Matrix:**\n   - After performing the moves, we need to update the matrix accordingly.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [0, 0, 8],\n    [32, 32, 32],\n    [0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Initial position of the number\nx, y = 1, 1\n\n# Move sequence\nmoves = 'lrl'\n\n# Simulate the moves\nfor move in moves:\n    if move == 'l':\n        if y > 0:\n            if matrix[x][y-1] == matrix[x][y]:\n                matrix[x][y-1] *= 2\n                matrix[x][y] = 0\n            else:\n                matrix[x][y-1], matrix[x][y] = matrix[x][y], matrix[x][y-1]\n            y -= 1\n    elif move == 'r':\n        if y < 2:\n            if matrix[x][y+1] == matrix[x][y]:\n                matrix[x][y+1] *= 2\n                matrix[x][y] = 0\n            else:\n                matrix[x][y+1], matrix[x][y] = matrix[x][y], matrix[x][y+1]\n            y += 1\n\n# Print the final matrix\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the final matrix.",
