  "question": "In an 5x5 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (5, 3) using the sequence 'llruu':\n0, 0, 0, 16, 0\n0, 0, 0, 16, 0\n8, 0, 2, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n2, 0, 8, 32, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number located at position (5, 3) in the given 5x5 grid according to the sequence 'llruu'. The number at this position is 8. We will follow the movement instructions and apply the rules of the '2048' game to see how the grid changes.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Initial Position**: The number 8 is at position (5, 3).\n2. **Move 'l' (left)**: The number moves from (5, 3) to (5, 2). Since (5, 2) is 0, the number 8 moves to this position.\n3. **Move 'l' (left)**: The number moves from (5, 2) to (5, 1). Since (5, 1) is 2, which is not the same power of 2 as 8, the number 8 cannot combine and remains at (5, 1).\n4. **Move 'r' (right)**: The number moves from (5, 1) to (5, 2). Since (5, 2) is 0, the number 8 moves to this position.\n5. **Move 'u' (up)**: The number moves from (5, 2) to (4, 2). Since (4, 2) is 0, the number 8 moves to this position.\n6. **Move 'u' (up)**: The number moves from (4, 2) to (3, 2). Since (3, 2) is 0, the number 8 moves to this position.\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in Python to update the grid and see the final state of the matrix.\n\n```python\n# Initial grid\ngrid = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 16, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 16, 0],\n    [8, 0, 2, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [2, 0, 8, 32, 0]\n]\n\n# Initial position of the number 8\nposition = (4, 2)  # (row, column) in 0-indexed\n\n# Movement sequence\nmoves = 'llruu'\n\n# Function to move the number according to the sequence\ndef move_number(grid, position, moves):\n    for move in moves:\n        row, col = position\n        if move == 'l':\n            new_col = col - 1\n            if new_col >= 0 and (grid[row][new_col] == 0 or grid[row][new_col] == grid[row][col]):\n                grid[row][new_col] += grid[row][col]\n                grid[row][col] = 0\n                position = (row, new_col)\n        elif move == 'r':\n            new_col = col + 1\n            if new_col < 5 and (grid[row][new_col] == 0 or grid[row][new_col] == grid[row][col]):\n                grid[row][new_col] += grid[row][col]\n                grid[row][col] = 0\n                position = (row, new_col)\n        elif move == 'u':\n            new_row = row - 1\n            if new_row >= 0 and (grid[new_row][col] == 0 or grid[new_row][col] == grid[row][col]):\n                grid[new_row][col] += grid[row][col]\n                grid[row][col] = 0\n                position = (new_row, col)\n        elif move == 'd':\n            new_row = row + 1\n            if new_row < 5 and (grid[new_row][col] == 0 or grid[new_row][col] == grid[row][col]):\n                grid[new_row][col] += grid[row][col]\n                grid[row][col] = 0\n                position = (new_row, col)\n    return grid\n\n# Apply the moves\nfinal_grid = move_number(grid, position, moves)\n\n# Print the final grid\nprint(final_grid)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to see the final state of the matrix.",
