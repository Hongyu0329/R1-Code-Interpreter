  "question": "In an 4x4 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (4, 2) using the sequence 'uddd':\n0, 0, 0, 32\n0, 8, 0, 0\n0, 0, 16, 4\n32, 32, 4, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (4, 2) according to the sequence 'uddd'. The initial matrix is:\n\n```\n0, 0, 0, 32\n0, 8, 0, 0\n0, 0, 16, 4\n32, 32, 4, 0\n```\n\nThe number at position (4, 2) is 32. We will follow the sequence of moves:\n\n1. **Move 'u' (up):** Move the number at (4, 2) to (3, 2).\n2. **Move 'd' (down):** Move the number at (3, 2) to (4, 2).\n3. **Move 'd' (down):** Move the number at (4, 2) to (4, 2) (no change).\n4. **Move 'd' (down):** Move the number at (4, 2) to (4, 2) (no change).\n\nDuring each move, we need to check if the number can combine with another number. If it encounters a number of the same power of 2, they combine to form the next power of 2.\n\nLet's simulate this process using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 32],\n    [0, 8, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 16, 4],\n    [32, 32, 4, 0]\n]\n\n# Initial position of the number to move\nposition = (3, 1)  # (row, column) in 0-indexed\n\n# Sequence of moves\nmoves = 'uddd'\n\n# Function to perform a move\ndef move_number(matrix, position, direction):\n    row, col = position\n    if direction == 'u' and row > 0:\n        target_row = row - 1\n        if matrix[target_row][col] == matrix[row][col]:\n            matrix[target_row][col] *= 2\n            matrix[row][col] = 0\n        elif matrix[target_row][col] == 0:\n            matrix[target_row][col] = matrix[row][col]\n            matrix[row][col] = 0\n        position = (target_row, col)\n    elif direction == 'd' and row < 3:\n        target_row = row + 1\n        if matrix[target_row][col] == matrix[row][col]:\n            matrix[target_row][col] *= 2\n            matrix[row][col] = 0\n        elif matrix[target_row][col] == 0:\n            matrix[target_row][col] = matrix[row][col]\n            matrix[row][col] = 0\n        position = (target_row, col)\n    return position\n\n# Perform the sequence of moves\nfor move in moves:\n    position = move_number(matrix, position, move)\n\n# Print the final matrix\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final state of the matrix.",
    "The code execution shows that the matrix remains unchanged after the sequence of moves 'uddd'. This is because the number at position (4, 2) (which is 32) moves up to (3, 2) and then back down to (4, 2) without encountering any numbers to combine with.\n\nTherefore, the final matrix after performing the moves is:\n\n<<<[[0, 0, 0, 32], [0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 16, 4], [32, 32, 4, 0]]>>>"
