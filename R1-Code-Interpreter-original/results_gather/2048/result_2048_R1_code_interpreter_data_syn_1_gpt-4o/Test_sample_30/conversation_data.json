  "question": "In an 3x3 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (2, 1) using the sequence 'duu':\n0, 0, 4\n0, 2, 0\n0, 0, 16\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (2, 1) according to the sequence 'duu'. The initial matrix is:\n\n```\n0, 0, 4\n0, 2, 0\n0, 0, 16\n```\n\nThe sequence 'duu' means:\n1. Move up ('u')\n2. Move up ('u')\n3. Move down ('d')\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Position**: The number 2 is at position (2, 1).\n2. **First Move ('u')**: Move the number 2 up to position (1, 1).\n3. **Second Move ('u')**: Move the number 2 up to position (0, 1).\n4. **Third Move ('d')**: Move the number 2 down to position (1, 1).\n\nDuring these moves, we need to check if the number can combine with another number. In this case, the number 2 will not encounter another 2, so it will not combine with any other number.\n\nLet's simulate this process using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [0, 0, 4],\n    [0, 2, 0],\n    [0, 0, 16]\n]\n\n# Initial position of the number 2\nposition = (2, 1)\n\n# Sequence of moves\nmoves = 'duu'\n\n# Function to perform the move\ndef move_number(matrix, position, moves):\n    for move in moves:\n        x, y = position\n        if move == 'u' and x > 0:\n            # Move up\n            if matrix[x-1][y] == matrix[x][y]:\n                matrix[x-1][y] *= 2\n                matrix[x][y] = 0\n            elif matrix[x-1][y] == 0:\n                matrix[x-1][y] = matrix[x][y]\n                matrix[x][y] = 0\n            position = (x-1, y)\n        elif move == 'd' and x < 2:\n            # Move down\n            if matrix[x+1][y] == matrix[x][y]:\n                matrix[x+1][y] *= 2\n                matrix[x][y] = 0\n            elif matrix[x+1][y] == 0:\n                matrix[x+1][y] = matrix[x][y]\n                matrix[x][y] = 0\n            position = (x+1, y)\n        elif move == 'l' and y > 0:\n            # Move left\n            if matrix[x][y-1] == matrix[x][y]:\n                matrix[x][y-1] *= 2\n                matrix[x][y] = 0\n            elif matrix[x][y-1] == 0:\n                matrix[x][y-1] = matrix[x][y]\n                matrix[x][y] = 0\n            position = (x, y-1)\n        elif move == 'r' and y < 2:\n            # Move right\n            if matrix[x][y+1] == matrix[x][y]:\n                matrix[x][y+1] *= 2\n                matrix[x][y] = 0\n            elif matrix[x][y+1] == 0:\n                matrix[x][y+1] = matrix[x][y]\n                matrix[x][y] = 0\n            position = (x, y+1)\n    return matrix\n\n# Perform the moves\nresult_matrix = move_number(matrix, position, moves)\n\n# Print the resulting matrix\nprint(result_matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the resulting matrix after the moves.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the resulting matrix after performing the sequence of moves 'duu'. The matrix after moving the number in position (2, 1) is:\n\n<<<[[0, 2, 4], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 16]]>>>"
