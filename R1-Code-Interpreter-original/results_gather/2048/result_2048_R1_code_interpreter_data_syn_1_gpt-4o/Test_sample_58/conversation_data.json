  "question": "In an 4x4 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (2, 2) using the sequence 'rrud':\n0, 4, 8, 0\n0, 2, 0, 0\n0, 32, 2, 0\n2, 4, 0, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number at position (2, 2) in the given 4x4 grid according to the sequence 'rrud'. The number at position (2, 2) is 2. We will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initial Position**: Start at position (2, 2) with the number 2.\n2. **Move Right (r)**: Move to position (2, 3). Since the number at (2, 3) is 0, the number 2 will move to this position.\n3. **Move Right (r)**: Move to position (2, 4). Since the number at (2, 4) is 0, the number 2 will move to this position.\n4. **Move Up (u)**: Move to position (1, 4). Since the number at (1, 4) is 0, the number 2 will move to this position.\n5. **Move Down (d)**: Move back to position (2, 4). Since the number at (2, 4) is 0, the number 2 will move to this position.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to update the matrix accordingly.\n\n```python\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [0, 4, 8, 0],\n    [0, 2, 0, 0],\n    [0, 32, 2, 0],\n    [2, 4, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Initial position of the number to move\nposition = (2, 2)\n\n# Sequence of moves\nmoves = 'rrud'\n\n# Function to perform the moves\ndef move_number(matrix, position, moves):\n    x, y = position\n    for move in moves:\n        if move == 'r':\n            y += 1\n        elif move == 'l':\n            y -= 1\n        elif move == 'u':\n            x -= 1\n        elif move == 'd':\n            x += 1\n        \n        # Check if the current position is within bounds and if the cell is empty\n        if 0 <= x < 4 and 0 <= y < 4 and matrix[x][y] == 0:\n            # Move the number\n            matrix[x][y] = matrix[position[0]][position[1]]\n            # Clear the previous position\n            matrix[position[0]][position[1]] = 0\n            # Update the current position\n            position = (x, y)\n    \n    return matrix\n\n# Perform the moves\nresult_matrix = move_number(matrix, position, moves)\n\n# Print the resulting matrix\nprint(result_matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to see the final state of the matrix after performing the moves.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the final state of the matrix after performing the moves is:\n\n<<<[[0, 4, 8, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 32, 0, 2], [2, 4, 0, 0]]>>>"
