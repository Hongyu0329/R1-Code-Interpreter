  "question": "In an 2x2 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (2, 2) using the sequence 'dl':\n0, 8\n2, 2\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (2, 2) according to the given sequence 'dl'. The initial matrix is:\n\n```\n0, 8\n2, 2\n```\n\nThe sequence 'dl' means:\n- 'd': Move down\n- 'l': Move left\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Position**: The number at position (2, 2) is 2.\n2. **Move 'd' (down)**: Since the number is already at the bottom row, moving down doesn't change its position.\n3. **Move 'l' (left)**: The number moves from position (2, 2) to position (2, 1).\n\nAfter moving left, the number at position (2, 1) is 2, and it encounters another 2. According to the rules of the game, they combine to form 4.\n\nLet's simulate this process using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [0, 8],\n    [2, 2]\n]\n\n# Move sequence\nsequence = 'dl'\n\n# Function to perform the move\ndef move_and_combine(matrix, sequence):\n    # Start position of the number to move\n    pos = (1, 1)  # (row, column) in zero-indexed\n\n    for move in sequence:\n        if move == 'd':\n            # Move down\n            if pos[0] < 1:  # Check if not at the bottom row\n                pos = (pos[0] + 1, pos[1])\n        elif move == 'l':\n            # Move left\n            if pos[1] > 0:  # Check if not at the leftmost column\n                pos = (pos[0], pos[1] - 1)\n\n    # After moving, check for combination\n    if matrix[pos[0]][pos[1]] == 2:\n        matrix[pos[0]][pos[1]] *= 2  # Combine to form 4\n        matrix[1][1] = 0  # Clear the original position\n\n    return matrix\n\n# Perform the move and combination\nresult_matrix = move_and_combine(matrix, sequence)\n\n# Print the resulting matrix\nprint(result_matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the resulting matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the resulting matrix after applying the move sequence 'dl' is:\n\n```\n[[0, 8], \n [4, 0]]\n```\n\nThis means that after moving the number in position (2, 2) according to the sequence 'dl', the matrix becomes:\n\n- The number 2 at position (2, 2) moves left to position (2, 1) and combines with the existing 2 to form 4.\n- The original position (2, 2) is cleared to 0.\n\nThus, the final matrix is:\n\n<<<[[0, 8], [4, 0]]>>>"
