  "question": "In an 5x5 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (4, 4) using the sequence 'ulurrl':\n0, 4, 0, 2, 0\n0, 16, 8, 0, 32\n0, 0, 0, 16, 0\n4, 16, 0, 0, 0\n0, 8, 0, 0, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number located at position (4, 4) in the given 5x5 grid according to the sequence 'ulurrl'. The rules of the '2048' game will be applied during the movement.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Position**: The number is at position (4, 4), which is 0 in the grid.\n2. **Movement Sequence**: 'ulurrl' translates to:\n   - u: Move up\n   - l: Move left\n   - u: Move up\n   - r: Move right\n   - r: Move right\n   - l: Move left\n\n3. **Simulate Each Move**:\n   - For each move, check if the adjacent cell in the direction of the move contains the same number. If it does, combine them into the next power of 2. If not, just move the number to the new position.\n   - Update the grid after each move.\n\n4. **Final Grid**: After processing all moves, we will have the final state of the grid.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to simulate the moves and update the grid accordingly.\n\n```python\n# Initial grid\ngrid = [\n    [0, 4, 0, 2, 0],\n    [0, 16, 8, 0, 32],\n    [0, 0, 0, 16, 0],\n    [4, 16, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Initial position of the number to move\nposition = (4, 4)\n\n# Movement sequence\nmoves = 'ulurrl'\n\n# Function to perform a move\ndef move_number(grid, position, direction):\n    x, y = position\n    if direction == 'u':\n        new_x, new_y = x - 1, y\n    elif direction == 'd':\n        new_x, new_y = x + 1, y\n    elif direction == 'l':\n        new_x, new_y = x, y - 1\n    elif direction == 'r':\n        new_x, new_y = x, y + 1\n    else:\n        return position  # Invalid direction, no move\n\n    # Check if the new position is within bounds\n    if 0 <= new_x < 5 and 0 <= new_y < 5:\n        # Check if the numbers can be combined\n        if grid[new_x][new_y] == grid[x][y]:\n            grid[new_x][new_y] *= 2\n            grid[x][y] = 0\n        else:\n            # Move the number to the new position\n            grid[new_x][new_y], grid[x][y] = grid[x][y], grid[new_x][new_y]\n        return new_x, new_y\n    return position\n\n# Simulate the moves\nfor move in moves:\n    position = move_number(grid, position, move)\n\n# Print the final grid\nprint(grid)\n```\n\nThis code will simulate the movement of the number according to the given sequence and print the final state of the grid. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the final state of the grid after applying the movement sequence 'ulurrl' is:\n\n<<<[[0, 4, 0, 2, 0], [0, 16, 8, 0, 32], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 16, 0, 16, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 0]]>>>"
