  "question": "In an 4x4 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (4, 4) using the sequence 'ddud':\n16, 8, 0, 2\n0, 0, 32, 0\n0, 4, 32, 0\n0, 32, 0, 2\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (4, 4) according to the sequence 'ddud'. The initial matrix is:\n\n```\n16, 8, 0, 2\n0, 0, 32, 0\n0, 4, 32, 0\n0, 32, 0, 2\n```\n\nThe number at position (4, 4) is 2. We will move this number according to the sequence and apply the rules of the 2048 game.\n\n1. **Move 'd' (down):** The number 2 at (4, 4) cannot move down as it is already at the bottom row. So, it stays at (4, 4).\n\n2. **Move 'd' (down):** Again, the number 2 at (4, 4) cannot move down. It stays at (4, 4).\n\n3. **Move 'u' (up):** The number 2 at (4, 4) moves up to (3, 4). The number at (3, 4) is 0, so 2 moves to (3, 4).\n\n4. **Move 'd' (down):** The number 2 at (3, 4) moves down to (4, 4). The number at (4, 4) is 0, so 2 moves to (4, 4).\n\nNow, let's simulate this process using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [16, 8, 0, 2],\n    [0, 0, 32, 0],\n    [0, 4, 32, 0],\n    [0, 32, 0, 2]\n]\n\n# Initial position of the number to move\nposition = (3, 3)  # (row, column) in 0-indexed\n\n# Sequence of moves\nmoves = 'ddud'\n\n# Function to move the number in the matrix\ndef move_number(matrix, position, moves):\n    for move in moves:\n        row, col = position\n        if move == 'u' and row > 0:\n            if matrix[row-1][col] == 0:\n                matrix[row-1][col] = matrix[row][col]\n                matrix[row][col] = 0\n                position = (row-1, col)\n            elif matrix[row-1][col] == matrix[row][col]:\n                matrix[row-1][col] *= 2\n                matrix[row][col] = 0\n                position = (row-1, col)\n        elif move == 'd' and row < 3:\n            if matrix[row+1][col] == 0:\n                matrix[row+1][col] = matrix[row][col]\n                matrix[row][col] = 0\n                position = (row+1, col)\n            elif matrix[row+1][col] == matrix[row][col]:\n                matrix[row+1][col] *= 2\n                matrix[row][col] = 0\n                position = (row+1, col)\n        elif move == 'l' and col > 0:\n            if matrix[row][col-1] == 0:\n                matrix[row][col-1] = matrix[row][col]\n                matrix[row][col] = 0\n                position = (row, col-1)\n            elif matrix[row][col-1] == matrix[row][col]:\n                matrix[row][col-1] *= 2\n                matrix[row][col] = 0\n                position = (row, col-1)\n        elif move == 'r' and col < 3:\n            if matrix[row][col+1] == 0:\n                matrix[row][col+1] = matrix[row][col]\n                matrix[row][col] = 0\n                position = (row, col+1)\n            elif matrix[row][col+1] == matrix[row][col]:\n                matrix[row][col+1] *= 2\n                matrix[row][col] = 0\n                position = (row, col+1)\n    return matrix\n\n# Apply the moves\nresult_matrix = move_number(matrix, position, moves)\n\n# Print the resulting matrix\nprint(result_matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final matrix after the moves.",
