  "question": "In an 4x4 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (4, 4) using the sequence 'uuul':\n4, 0, 0, 0\n0, 2, 32, 0\n0, 0, 0, 16\n0, 0, 0, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (4, 4) according to the sequence 'uuul'. The initial matrix is:\n\n```\n4, 0, 0, 0\n0, 2, 32, 0\n0, 0, 0, 16\n0, 0, 0, 0\n```\n\nThe number at position (4, 4) is 0. We will move this number according to the sequence 'uuul':\n\n1. **Move Up (u):** The number at (4, 4) moves to (3, 4).\n2. **Move Up (u):** The number at (3, 4) moves to (2, 4).\n3. **Move Up (u):** The number at (2, 4) moves to (1, 4).\n4. **Move Left (l):** The number at (1, 4) moves to (1, 3).\n\nSince the number is 0, it will not combine with any other numbers. Let's simulate this movement using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [4, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 2, 32, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 16],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Initial position of the number to move\nposition = (3, 3)  # (4, 4) in 0-indexed\n\n# Sequence of moves\nmoves = 'uuul'\n\n# Function to move the number\ndef move_number(matrix, position, moves):\n    x, y = position\n    for move in moves:\n        if move == 'u':\n            x -= 1\n        elif move == 'd':\n            x += 1\n        elif move == 'l':\n            y -= 1\n        elif move == 'r':\n            y += 1\n        # Check if the move is within bounds\n        if 0 <= x < 4 and 0 <= y < 4:\n            # Move the number\n            matrix[x][y] = matrix[x][y] + matrix[position[0]][position[1]]\n            matrix[position[0]][position[1]] = 0\n            position = (x, y)\n    return matrix\n\n# Apply the moves\nresult_matrix = move_number(matrix, position, moves)\n\n# Print the resulting matrix\nprint(result_matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to see the resulting matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the resulting matrix after moving the number according to the sequence 'uuul' is:\n\n```\n4, 0, 16, 0\n0, 2, 32, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0\n```\n\nThe number initially at position (4, 4) moved up three times and then left once, ending at position (1, 3). Since it was 0, it did not affect any other numbers in the matrix.\n\n<<<[[4, 0, 16, 0], [0, 2, 32, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]>>>"
