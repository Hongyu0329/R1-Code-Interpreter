  "question": "In an 5x5 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (3, 1) using the sequence 'rlrrlr':\n0, 0, 0, 0, 8\n0, 0, 32, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n16, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 32, 8\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (3, 1) according to the given sequence 'rlrrlr'. The initial matrix is:\n\n```\n0, 0, 0, 0, 8\n0, 0, 32, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n16, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 32, 8\n```\n\nThe number at position (3, 1) is 16. We will move this number according to the sequence and update the matrix accordingly. The sequence 'rlrrlr' corresponds to the following moves:\n\n1. r: Move right\n2. l: Move left\n3. r: Move right\n4. r: Move right\n5. l: Move left\n6. r: Move right\n\nLet's simulate these moves step by step:\n\n1. Start at position (3, 1) with the number 16.\n2. Move right to (3, 2).\n3. Move left back to (3, 1).\n4. Move right to (3, 2).\n5. Move right to (3, 3).\n6. Move left to (3, 2).\n7. Move right to (3, 3).\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in Python to update the matrix accordingly.\n\n```python\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n    [0, 0, 32, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [16, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 32, 8]\n]\n\n# Initial position of the number 16\nposition = (3, 1)\n\n# Sequence of moves\nmoves = 'rlrrlr'\n\n# Function to move the number in the matrix\ndef move_number(matrix, position, moves):\n    x, y = position\n    for move in moves:\n        if move == 'r' and y < 4:\n            y += 1\n        elif move == 'l' and y > 0:\n            y -= 1\n        # Update the matrix\n        if matrix[x][y] == 0:\n            matrix[x][y] = 16\n            matrix[x][y - 1] = 0\n        elif matrix[x][y] == 16:\n            matrix[x][y] = 32\n            matrix[x][y - 1] = 0\n    return matrix\n\n# Move the number according to the sequence\nresult_matrix = move_number(matrix, position, moves)\n\n# Print the resulting matrix\nprint(result_matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the final matrix after the moves.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the resulting matrix after applying the sequence of moves is:\n\n```\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n [0, 0, 32, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 32, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 32, 8]]\n```\n\nThis matrix reflects the movement of the number 16 starting from position (3, 1) and following the sequence 'rlrrlr'. The number 16 moved to position (3, 3) and combined with another 16 to form 32.\n\n<<<[[0, 0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 32, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 32, 0], [0, 0, 0, 32, 8]]>>>"
