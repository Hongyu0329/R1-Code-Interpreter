  "question": "In an 5x5 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (3, 3) using the sequence 'rrdluu':\n4, 32, 0, 16, 0\n16, 0, 0, 16, 0\n16, 4, 16, 0, 0\n0, 0, 32, 16, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (3, 3) according to the given sequence 'rrdluu'. The initial matrix is:\n\n```\n4, 32, 0, 16, 0\n16, 0, 0, 16, 0\n16, 4, 16, 0, 0\n0, 0, 32, 16, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n```\n\nThe number at position (3, 3) is 16. We will move this number according to the sequence and apply the rules of the 2048 game. Let's break down the sequence:\n\n1. **r (right)**: Move the number at (3, 3) to (3, 4).\n2. **r (right)**: Move the number at (3, 4) to (3, 5).\n3. **d (down)**: Move the number at (3, 5) to (4, 5).\n4. **l (left)**: Move the number at (4, 5) to (4, 4).\n5. **u (up)**: Move the number at (4, 4) to (3, 4).\n6. **u (up)**: Move the number at (3, 4) to (2, 4).\n\nDuring each move, if the number encounters another number of the same value, they combine to form the next power of 2.
