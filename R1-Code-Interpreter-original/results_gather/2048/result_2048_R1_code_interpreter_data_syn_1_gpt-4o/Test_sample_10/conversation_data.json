  "question": "In an 2x2 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (2, 2) using the sequence 'lr':\n8, 4\n16, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (2, 2) according to the given sequence 'lr'. The initial matrix is:\n\n```\n8, 4\n16, 0\n```\n\nThe number at position (2, 2) is 0. We will move this number according to the sequence 'lr':\n\n1. **Move Left ('l')**: \n   - The number 0 at position (2, 2) moves to position (2, 1).\n   - The matrix becomes:\n     ```\n     8, 4\n     0, 16\n     ```\n\n2. **Move Right ('r')**:\n   - The number 0 at position (2, 1) moves back to position (2, 2).\n   - The matrix returns to its original state:\n     ```\n     8, 4\n     16, 0\n     ```\n\nSince the number 0 does not combine with any other number, the matrix remains unchanged after the sequence 'lr'. Let's confirm this with a Python script to simulate the moves.\n\n```python\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [8, 4],\n    [16, 0]\n]\n\n# Move sequence\nmoves = 'lr'\n\n# Function to perform the moves\ndef move_number(matrix, moves):\n    # Start position of the number to move\n    pos = (1, 1)  # (row, column) in zero-indexed\n    for move in moves:\n        if move == 'l':  # Move left\n            if pos[1] > 0:\n                # Swap the number with the left cell\n                matrix[pos[0]][pos[1]], matrix[pos[0]][pos[1] - 1] = matrix[pos[0]][pos[1] - 1], matrix[pos[0]][pos[1]]\n                pos = (pos[0], pos[1] - 1)\n        elif move == 'r':  # Move right\n            if pos[1] < 1:\n                # Swap the number with the right cell\n                matrix[pos[0]][pos[1]], matrix[pos[0]][pos[1] + 1] = matrix[pos[0]][pos[1] + 1], matrix[pos[0]][pos[1]]\n                pos = (pos[0], pos[1] + 1)\n    return matrix\n\n# Perform the moves\nresult_matrix = move_number(matrix, moves)\n\n# Print the resulting matrix\nprint(result_matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the result.",
    "The code execution confirms that the matrix remains unchanged after performing the sequence 'lr'. The number 0 moves left and then right, returning to its original position without any combination occurring.\n\nTherefore, the final matrix after the moves is:\n\n<<<[[8, 4], [16, 0]]>>>"
