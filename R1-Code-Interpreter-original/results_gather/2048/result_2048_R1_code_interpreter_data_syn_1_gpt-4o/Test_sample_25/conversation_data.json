  "question": "In an 3x3 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (2, 2) using the sequence 'uul':\n32, 8, 32\n0, 32, 16\n0, 0, 2\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (2, 2) according to the given sequence 'uul'.

We will move it according to the sequence:\n\n1. **First 'u' (up):** Move the number at (2, 2) to (1, 2). The number at (1, 2) is 8, which is different from 32, so they do not combine.
