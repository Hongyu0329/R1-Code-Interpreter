  "question": "In an 2x2 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (1, 1) using the sequence 'ur':\n8, 0\n4, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (1, 1) according to the given sequence 'ur'. The initial matrix is:\n\n```\n8, 0\n4, 0\n```\n\nThe sequence 'ur' means:\n1. Move up ('u'): Since the number is already at the top row, moving up will not change its position.\n2. Move right ('r'): The number will move from position (1, 1) to position (1, 2).\n\nLet's simulate these moves step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Position**: (1, 1) with value 8\n   - Matrix:\n     ```\n     8, 0\n     4, 0\n     ```\n\n2. **Move Up ('u')**: The number 8 is already at the top row, so it stays in the same position.\n   - Matrix remains:\n     ```\n     8, 0\n     4, 0\n     ```\n\n3. **Move Right ('r')**: The number 8 moves from position (1, 1) to position (1, 2).\n   - Matrix becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 8\n     4, 0\n     ```\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in a Python script to verify the final matrix.\n\n```python\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [8, 0],\n    [4, 0]\n]\n\n# Move sequence\nsequence = 'ur'\n\n# Initial position of the number to move\nposition = (0, 0)  # (row, column) in 0-indexed\n\n# Execute the moves\nfor move in sequence:\n    if move == 'u':\n        # Move up: decrease row index if possible\n        if position[0] > 0:\n            position = (position[0] - 1, position[1])\n    elif move == 'r':\n        # Move right: increase column index if possible\n        if position[1] < 1:\n            position = (position[0], position[1] + 1)\n\n# Update the matrix with the new position\nnew_matrix = [[0, 0], [0, 0]]\nnew_matrix[position[0]][position[1]] = matrix[0][0]  # Move the number 8 to the new position\nnew_matrix[1][0] = matrix[1][0]  # Keep the number 4 in its original position\n\nprint(new_matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output matrix is `[[0, 8], [4, 0]]`. This matches our expected result after simulating the moves 'ur' on the initial matrix.\n\nTherefore, the final matrix after moving the number in position (1, 1) using the sequence 'ur' is:\n\n<<<[[0, 8], [4, 0]]>>>"
