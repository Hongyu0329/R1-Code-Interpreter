  "question": "In an 5x5 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (2, 1) using the sequence 'ddldlu':\n0, 2, 0, 0, 4\n32, 16, 0, 2, 32\n0, 2, 0, 0, 0\n0, 2, 0, 0, 0\n8, 0, 2, 0, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (2, 1) according to the given sequence 'ddldlu'. The initial matrix is:\n\n```\n0, 2, 0, 0, 4\n32, 16, 0, 2, 32\n0, 2, 0, 0, 0\n0, 2, 0, 0, 0\n8, 0, 2, 0, 0\n```\n\nThe sequence 'ddldlu' corresponds to the following moves:\n1. d: Move down\n2. d: Move down\n3. l: Move left\n4. d: Move down\n5. l: Move left\n6. u: Move up\n\nLet's simulate these moves step by step:\n\n1. Start at position (2, 1) with value 2.\n2. Move down to (3, 1). The value at (3, 1) is 2, so they combine to form 4.\n3. Move down to (4, 1). The value at (4, 1) is 2, so they combine to form 8.\n4. Move left to (4, 0). The value at (4, 0) is 8, so they combine to form 16.\n5. Move down to (5, 0). The value at (5, 0) is 8, so they combine to form 32.\n6. Move left to (5, -1), which is out of bounds, so the move is invalid. The number stays at (5, 0).\n7. Move up to (4, 0). The value at (4, 0) is 0, so the number moves to (4, 0) with value 32.\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in Python to update the matrix accordingly.\n\n```python\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [0, 2, 0, 0, 4],\n    [32, 16, 0, 2, 32],\n    [0, 2, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 2, 0, 0, 0],\n    [8, 0, 2, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Starting position\nx, y = 2, 1\n\n# Move sequence\nmoves = 'ddldlu'\n\n# Directions mapping\ndirections = {\n    'u': (-1, 0),\n    'd': (1, 0),\n    'l': (0, -1),\n    'r': (0, 1)\n}\n\n# Function to perform the move\ndef move_number(matrix, x, y, moves):\n    for move in moves:\n        dx, dy = directions[move]\n        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n        \n        # Check if the new position is within bounds\n        if 0 <= nx < 5 and 0 <= ny < 5:\n            if matrix[nx][ny] == matrix[x][y]:\n                # Combine numbers\n                matrix[nx][ny] *= 2\n                matrix[x][y] = 0\n            elif matrix[nx][ny] == 0:\n                # Move number\n                matrix[nx][ny] = matrix[x][y]\n                matrix[x][y] = 0\n            x, y = nx, ny\n    return matrix\n\n# Perform the moves\nresult_matrix = move_number(matrix, x, y, moves)\n\n# Print the resulting matrix\nprint(result_matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the final matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the resulting matrix after performing the moves is:\n\n```\n[[0, 2, 0, 0, 4],\n [32, 16, 0, 2, 32],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 4, 2, 0, 0]]\n```\n\nThis matrix reflects the changes after moving the number initially at position (2, 1) according to the sequence 'ddldlu'. The number combined with others as it moved, resulting in the final configuration.\n\n<<<[[0, 2, 0, 0, 4], [32, 16, 0, 2, 32], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 2, 0, 0]]>>>"
