  "question": "In an 4x4 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (2, 1) using the sequence 'dlul':\n0, 32, 8, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0\n8, 0, 0, 32\n16, 0, 0, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (2, 1) according to the sequence 'dlul'. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Position**: The number at position (2, 1) is 8.\n2. **Move Down ('d')**: Move the number from (2, 1) to (3, 1). The number at (3, 1) is also 8, so they combine to form 16. The new position (3, 1) now has 16, and (2, 1) becomes 0.\n3. **Move Left ('l')**: Move the number from (3, 1) to (3, 0). The number at (3, 0) is 16, so they combine to form 32. The new position (3, 0) now has 32, and (3, 1) becomes 0.\n4. **Move Up ('u')**: Move the number from (3, 0) to (2, 0). The number at (2, 0) is 0, so it simply moves without combining. The new position (2, 0) now has 32, and (3, 0) becomes 0.\n5. **Move Left ('l')**: Move the number from (2, 0) to (2, 0). Since it's already at the leftmost position, it doesn't move.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to verify the final state of the matrix.\n\n```python\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [0, 32, 8, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [8, 0, 0, 32],\n    [16, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Initial position of the number to move\nposition = (2, 1)\n\n# Sequence of moves\nmoves = 'dlul'\n\n# Function to perform the move\ndef move_number(matrix, position, direction):\n    x, y = position\n    if direction == 'd':\n        if x < 3 and matrix[x+1][y] == matrix[x][y]:\n            matrix[x+1][y] *= 2\n            matrix[x][y] = 0\n            x += 1\n        elif x < 3 and matrix[x+1][y] == 0:\n            matrix[x+1][y] = matrix[x][y]\n            matrix[x][y] = 0\n            x += 1\n    elif direction == 'l':\n        if y > 0 and matrix[x][y-1] == matrix[x][y]:\n            matrix[x][y-1] *= 2\n            matrix[x][y] = 0\n            y -= 1\n        elif y > 0 and matrix[x][y-1] == 0:\n            matrix[x][y-1] = matrix[x][y]\n            matrix[x][y] = 0\n            y -= 1\n    elif direction == 'u':\n        if x > 0 and matrix[x-1][y] == matrix[x][y]:\n            matrix[x-1][y] *= 2\n            matrix[x][y] = 0\n            x -= 1\n        elif x > 0 and matrix[x-1][y] == 0:\n            matrix[x-1][y] = matrix[x][y]\n            matrix[x][y] = 0\n            x -= 1\n    elif direction == 'r':\n        if y < 3 and matrix[x][y+1] == matrix[x][y]:\n            matrix[x][y+1] *= 2\n            matrix[x][y] = 0\n            y += 1\n        elif y < 3 and matrix[x][y+1] == 0:\n            matrix[x][y+1] = matrix[x][y]\n            matrix[x][y] = 0\n            y += 1\n    return (x, y)\n\n# Apply the sequence of moves\nfor move in moves:\n    position = move_number(matrix, position, move)\n\n# Print the final matrix\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final state of the matrix.",
