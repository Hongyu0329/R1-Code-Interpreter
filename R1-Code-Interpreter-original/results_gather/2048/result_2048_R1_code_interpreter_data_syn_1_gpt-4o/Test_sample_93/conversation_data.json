    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number located at position (2, 2) in the given 5x5 grid according to the sequence of moves 'duldrl'. The rules of the '2048' game will be applied during the movement.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Position**: The number at position (2, 2) is 16.\n2. **Move Sequence**: 'duldrl' translates to:\n   - 'd' (down)\n   - 'u' (up)\n   - 'l' (left)\n   - 'd' (down)\n   - 'r' (right)\n   - 'l' (left)\n\n3. **Simulate Each Move**:\n   - **Move 'd' (down)**: Move the number from (2, 2) to (3, 2). The number at (3, 2) is 32, which is different from 16, so no combination occurs.\n   - **Move 'u' (up)**: Move the number back to (2, 2). Again, no combination occurs.\n   - **Move 'l' (left)**: Move the number to (2, 1). The number at (2, 1) is 4, which is different from 16, so no combination occurs.\n   - **Move 'd' (down)**: Move the number to (3, 1). The number at (3, 1) is 0, so no combination occurs.\n   - **Move 'r' (right)**: Move the number to (3, 2). The number at (3, 2) is 32, which is different from 16, so no combination occurs.\n   - **Move 'l' (left)**: Move the number back to (3, 1). The number at (3, 1) is 0, so no combination occurs.\n\n4. **Final Position**: After executing all moves, the number ends up at position (3, 1).\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to update the matrix accordingly.\n\n```python\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 2],\n    [0, 32, 2, 0, 0],\n    [0, 4, 16, 0, 2],\n    [32, 0, 32, 2, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Initial position of the number to move\ncurrent_position = (2, 2)\n\n# Move sequence\nmoves = 'duldrl'\n\n# Direction vectors for moves\ndirections = {\n    'u': (-1, 0),\n    'd': (1, 0),\n    'l': (0, -1),\n    'r': (0, 1)\n}\n\n# Function to perform the move\ndef move_number(matrix, current_position, moves):\n    x, y = current_position\n    for move in moves:\n        dx, dy = directions[move]\n        new_x, new_y = x + dx, y + dy\n        # Check if the new position is within bounds\n        if 0 <= new_x < 5 and 0 <= new_y < 5:\n            # Check if the numbers can combine\n            if matrix[new_x][new_y] == matrix[x][y]:\n                matrix[new_x][new_y] *= 2\n                matrix[x][y] = 0\n            else:\n                # Move the number to the new position\n                matrix[new_x][new_y], matrix[x][y] = matrix[x][y], matrix[new_x][new_y]\n            # Update current position\n            x, y = new_x, new_y\n    return matrix\n\n# Perform the moves\nresult_matrix = move_number(matrix, current_position, moves)\n\n# Print the final matrix\nprint(result_matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to get the final matrix after the moves.",
