  "question": "In an 4x4 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (3, 2) using the sequence 'rrll':\n2, 0, 8, 2\n0, 16, 0, 0\n0, 0, 8, 4\n0, 16, 32, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (3, 2) according to the sequence 'rrll'. The grid is a 4x4 matrix, and the movement rules are similar to the 2048 game, where numbers can combine if they are the same power of 2.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Position**: The number at position (3, 2) is 0. However, since the number is 0, it doesn't affect the grid. We should focus on the number at position (3, 3), which is 8, as it is the first non-zero number in the row.\n\n2. **Movement Sequence**:\n   - **'r' (right)**: Move the number at (3, 3) to the right. It will combine with the number at (3, 4) if they are the same. In this case, (3, 3) is 8 and (3, 4) is 4, so they do not combine.\n   - **'r' (right)**: The number at (3, 4) is now 8, and it cannot move further right as it is at the edge.\n   - **'l' (left)**: Move the number at (3, 4) to the left. It will move to (3, 3).\n   - **'l' (left)**: Move the number at (3, 3) to the left. It will move to (3, 2).\n\n3. **Final Matrix**: After applying the sequence, we need to check the final state of the matrix.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to simulate the movement and get the final matrix.\n\n```python\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [2, 0, 8, 2],\n    [0, 16, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 8, 4],\n    [0, 16, 32, 0]\n]\n\n# Function to move right\ndef move_right(row):\n    new_row = [x for x in row if x != 0]  # Remove zeros\n    for i in range(len(new_row) - 1, 0, -1):\n        if new_row[i] == new_row[i - 1]:\n            new_row[i] *= 2\n            new_row[i - 1] = 0\n    new_row = [x for x in new_row if x != 0]  # Remove zeros again\n    return [0] * (len(row) - len(new_row)) + new_row\n\n# Function to move left\ndef move_left(row):\n    new_row = [x for x in row if x != 0]  # Remove zeros\n    for i in range(len(new_row) - 1):\n        if new_row[i] == new_row[i + 1]:\n            new_row[i] *= 2\n            new_row[i + 1] = 0\n    new_row = [x for x in new_row if x != 0]  # Remove zeros again\n    return new_row + [0] * (len(row) - len(new_row))\n\n# Apply the sequence 'rrll' to the third row\nmatrix[2] = move_right(matrix[2])\nmatrix[2] = move_right(matrix[2])\nmatrix[2] = move_left(matrix[2])\nmatrix[2] = move_left(matrix[2])\n\n# Print the final matrix\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the final matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the final matrix after applying the movement sequence 'rrll' to the third row is:\n\n<<<[[2, 0, 8, 2], [0, 16, 0, 0], [8, 4, 0, 0], [0, 16, 32, 0]]>>>"
