  "question": "In an 5x5 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (1, 2) using the sequence 'urdrl':\n0, 0, 0, 0, 8\n0, 32, 4, 8, 0\n4, 0, 0, 0, 0\n32, 0, 0, 0, 8\n0, 0, 0, 2, 32\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (1, 2) according to the sequence 'urdrl'. The initial position (1, 2) corresponds to the number 4 in the grid. We will follow the sequence of moves and apply the rules of the 2048 game to update the grid accordingly.\n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n1. **u (up)**: Move the number at (1, 2) to (0, 2).\n2. **r (right)**: Move the number at (0, 2) to (0, 3).\n3. **d (down)**: Move the number at (0, 3) to (1, 3).\n4. **r (right)**: Move the number at (1, 3) to (1, 4).\n5. **l (left)**: Move the number at (1, 4) to (1, 3).\n\nDuring each move, we need to check if the number can combine with another number of the same value. If it can, they will merge into a single number of the next power of 2.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to simulate the moves and update the grid.\n\n```python\n# Initial grid\ngrid = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n    [0, 32, 4, 8, 0],\n    [4, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [32, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n    [0, 0, 0, 2, 32]\n]\n\n# Initial position of the number to move\nposition = (1, 2)\n\n# Sequence of moves\nmoves = 'urdrl'\n\n# Function to perform a move\ndef move(grid, position, direction):\n    x, y = position\n    if direction == 'u':\n        new_x, new_y = x - 1, y\n    elif direction == 'd':\n        new_x, new_y = x + 1, y\n    elif direction == 'l':\n        new_x, new_y = x, y - 1\n    elif direction == 'r':\n        new_x, new_y = x, y + 1\n    else:\n        return position  # Invalid direction, no move\n\n    # Check if the new position is within bounds\n    if 0 <= new_x < 5 and 0 <= new_y < 5:\n        # Check if the numbers can combine\n        if grid[new_x][new_y] == grid[x][y]:\n            grid[new_x][new_y] *= 2\n            grid[x][y] = 0\n        elif grid[new_x][new_y] == 0:\n            grid[new_x][new_y] = grid[x][y]\n            grid[x][y] = 0\n        return (new_x, new_y)\n    return position\n\n# Perform the sequence of moves\nfor move_direction in moves:\n    position = move(grid, position, move_direction)\n\n# Print the final grid\nprint(grid)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to see the final state of the grid after performing the moves.",
