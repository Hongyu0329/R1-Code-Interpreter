  "question": "In an 5x5 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (2, 4) using the sequence 'ldrll':\n2, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n2, 2, 2, 8, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (2, 4) according to the sequence 'ldrll'. The initial matrix is:\n\n```\n2, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n2, 2, 2, 8, 0\n```\n\nThe number at position (2, 4) is 8. We will move this number according to the sequence 'ldrll':\n\n1. **l (left)**: Move the number 8 from (2, 4) to (2, 3).\n2. **d (down)**: Move the number 8 from (2, 3) to (3, 3).\n3. **r (right)**: Move the number 8 from (3, 3) to (3, 4).\n4. **l (left)**: Move the number 8 from (3, 4) to (3, 3).\n5. **l (left)**: Move the number 8 from (3, 3) to (3, 2).\n\nLet's simulate these movements using Python code to update the matrix accordingly.\n\n```python\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [2, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [2, 2, 2, 8, 0]\n]\n\n# Initial position of the number 8\nposition = (4, 3)\n\n# Sequence of moves\nmoves = 'ldrll'\n\n# Function to move the number in the matrix\ndef move_number(matrix, position, moves):\n    x, y = position\n    for move in moves:\n        if move == 'l':\n            if y > 0:\n                y -= 1\n        elif move == 'r':\n            if y < 4:\n                y += 1\n        elif move == 'u':\n            if x > 0:\n                x -= 1\n        elif move == 'd':\n            if x < 4:\n                x += 1\n    return x, y\n\n# Get the final position after all moves\nfinal_position = move_number(matrix, position, moves)\n\n# Update the matrix with the new position of the number 8\nmatrix[4][3] = 0  # Clear the initial position\nmatrix[final_position[0]][final_position[1]] = 8  # Set the new position\n\n# Print the updated matrix\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to see the final state of the matrix.",
