  "question": "In an 5x5 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (4, 3) using the sequence 'uulll':\n8, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 8, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 32, 0, 16, 32\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (4, 3) according to the given sequence 'uulll'. The initial matrix is:\n\n```\n8, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 8, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 32, 0, 16, 32\n```\n\nThe number at position (4, 3) is 16. We will move this number according to the sequence:\n\n1. Move up (u): The number moves from (4, 3) to (3, 3).\n2. Move up (u): The number moves from (3, 3) to (2, 3).\n3. Move left (l): The number moves from (2, 3) to (2, 2).\n4. Move left (l): The number moves from (2, 2) to (2, 1).\n5. Move left (l): The number moves from (2, 1) to (2, 0).\n\nDuring these moves, we need to check if the number can combine with another number. In this case, there are no numbers to combine with, so the number simply moves to the new position.\n\nLet's simulate this process using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 8, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 32, 0, 16, 32]\n]\n\n# Initial position of the number to move\nx, y = 4, 3\n\n# Sequence of moves\nmoves = 'uulll'\n\n# Function to move the number\ndef move_number(matrix, x, y, moves):\n    for move in moves:\n        if move == 'u':\n            if x > 0:\n                if matrix[x-1][y] == matrix[x][y]:\n                    matrix[x-1][y] *= 2\n                    matrix[x][y] = 0\n                elif matrix[x-1][y] == 0:\n                    matrix[x-1][y] = matrix[x][y]\n                    matrix[x][y] = 0\n                x -= 1\n        elif move == 'd':\n            if x < len(matrix) - 1:\n                if matrix[x+1][y] == matrix[x][y]:\n                    matrix[x+1][y] *= 2\n                    matrix[x][y] = 0\n                elif matrix[x+1][y] == 0:\n                    matrix[x+1][y] = matrix[x][y]\n                    matrix[x][y] = 0\n                x += 1\n        elif move == 'l':\n            if y > 0:\n                if matrix[x][y-1] == matrix[x][y]:\n                    matrix[x][y-1] *= 2\n                    matrix[x][y] = 0\n                elif matrix[x][y-1] == 0:\n                    matrix[x][y-1] = matrix[x][y]\n                    matrix[x][y] = 0\n                y -= 1\n        elif move == 'r':\n            if y < len(matrix[0]) - 1:\n                if matrix[x][y+1] == matrix[x][y]:\n                    matrix[x][y+1] *= 2\n                    matrix[x][y] = 0\n                elif matrix[x][y+1] == 0:\n                    matrix[x][y+1] = matrix[x][y]\n                    matrix[x][y] = 0\n                y += 1\n    return matrix\n\n# Move the number according to the sequence\nresult_matrix = move_number(matrix, x, y, moves)\n\n# Print the resulting matrix\nprint(result_matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the resulting matrix.",
