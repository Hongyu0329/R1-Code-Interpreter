    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the numbers in the grid according to the rules of the 2048 game. The initial grid is:\n\n```\n8, 8\n8, 32\n```\n\nThe sequence of moves is 'rr', which means we move the numbers to the right twice. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Grid:**\n   ```\n   8, 8\n   8, 32\n   ```\n\n2. **First Move (r):**\n   - For the first row `[8, 8]`, moving right will combine the two 8s into a 16, resulting in `[0, 16]`.\n   - For the second row `[8, 32]`, moving right will not combine any numbers because they are different, resulting in `[0, 8, 32]`.\n\n3. **Second Move (r):**\n   - For the first row `[0, 16]`, moving right will not change the row because there is only one non-zero number, resulting in `[0, 16]`.\n   - For the second row `[0, 8, 32]`, moving right will not change the row because there is no combination possible, resulting in `[0, 8, 32]`.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to verify the final grid state.\n\n```python\ndef move_right(row):\n    # Remove zeros and combine numbers\n    new_row = [num for num in row if num != 0]\n    for i in range(len(new_row) - 1, 0, -1):\n        if new_row[i] == new_row[i - 1]:\n            new_row[i] *= 2\n            new_row[i - 1] = 0\n    # Remove zeros again and fill with zeros to the left\n    new_row = [num for num in new_row if num != 0]\n    return [0] * (len(row) - len(new_row)) + new_row\n\n# Initial grid\ngrid = [\n    [8, 8],\n    [8, 32]\n]\n\n# First move (r)\ngrid[0] = move_right(grid[0])\ngrid[1] = move_right(grid[1])\n\n# Second move (r)\ngrid[0] = move_right(grid[0])\ngrid[1] = move_right(grid[1])\n\nprint(grid)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to find the final state of the grid.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the final state of the grid after applying the 'rr' moves is:\n\n```\n[[0, 16], [8, 32]]\n```\n\nThis means that after moving the numbers to the right twice, the grid looks like this:\n\n- The first row has combined the two 8s into a 16, and since there are no more numbers to combine, it remains `[0, 16]`.\n- The second row remains unchanged as `[8, 32]` because the numbers are different and cannot be combined.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[[0, 16], [8, 32]]>>>"
