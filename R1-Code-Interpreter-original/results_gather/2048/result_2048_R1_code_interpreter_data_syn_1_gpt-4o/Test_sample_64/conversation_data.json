  "question": "In an 5x5 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (5, 2) using the sequence 'lrrur':\n0, 0, 8, 32, 0\n8, 0, 0, 32, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n4, 4, 0, 32, 4\n2, 32, 0, 0, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (5, 2) according to the given sequence 'lrrur'. The initial matrix is:\n\n```\n0, 0, 8, 32, 0\n8, 0, 0, 32, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n4, 4, 0, 32, 4\n2, 32, 0, 0, 0\n```\n\nThe number at position (5, 2) is 32. We will move this number according to the sequence and apply the rules of the '2048' game.\n\n1. **Move 'l' (left):** The number 32 at (5, 2) moves to (5, 1). The row becomes [32, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n2. **Move 'r' (right):** The number 32 at (5, 1) moves to (5, 2). The row becomes [0, 32, 0, 0, 0].\n3. **Move 'r' (right):** The number 32 at (5, 2) moves to (5, 3). The row becomes [0, 0, 32, 0, 0].\n4. **Move 'u' (up):** The number 32 at (5, 3) moves to (4, 3). The column becomes [8, 0, 0, 32, 0].\n5. **Move 'r' (right):** The number 32 at (4, 3) moves to (4, 4). The row becomes [4, 4, 0, 32, 4].\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in Python to simulate the moves and update the matrix accordingly.\n\n```python\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [0, 0, 8, 32, 0],\n    [8, 0, 0, 32, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [4, 4, 0, 32, 4],\n    [2, 32, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Initial position of the number to move\nposition = (4, 1)  # (row, column) in 0-indexed\n\n# Sequence of moves\nmoves = 'lrrur'\n\n# Function to perform a move\ndef move_number(matrix, position, direction):\n    row, col = position\n    if direction == 'l':\n        # Move left\n        while col > 0 and matrix[row][col-1] == 0:\n            matrix[row][col-1] = matrix[row][col]\n            matrix[row][col] = 0\n            col -= 1\n    elif direction == 'r':\n        # Move right\n        while col < 4 and matrix[row][col+1] == 0:\n            matrix[row][col+1] = matrix[row][col]\n            matrix[row][col] = 0\n            col += 1\n    elif direction == 'u':\n        # Move up\n        while row > 0 and matrix[row-1][col] == 0:\n            matrix[row-1][col] = matrix[row][col]\n            matrix[row][col] = 0\n            row -= 1\n    elif direction == 'd':\n        # Move down\n        while row < 4 and matrix[row+1][col] == 0:\n            matrix[row+1][col] = matrix[row][col]\n            matrix[row][col] = 0\n            row += 1\n    return (row, col)\n\n# Apply the sequence of moves\nfor move in moves:\n    position = move_number(matrix, position, move)\n\n# Print the final matrix\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the final matrix after performing the moves.",
