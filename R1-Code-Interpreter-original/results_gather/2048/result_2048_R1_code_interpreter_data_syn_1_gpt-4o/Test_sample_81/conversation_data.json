  "question": "In an 5x5 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (3, 2) using the sequence 'rdlluu':\n0, 0, 0, 0, 2\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 8, 0, 32\n0, 0, 0, 0, 4\n4, 32, 0, 0, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number located at position (3, 2) in the given 5x5 grid according to the sequence 'rdlluu'. The rules of the '2048' game will be applied during the movement.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Position**: The number at position (3, 2) is 8.\n2. **Movement Sequence**: 'rdlluu' translates to:\n   - 'r': Move right\n   - 'd': Move down\n   - 'l': Move left\n   - 'l': Move left\n   - 'u': Move up\n   - 'u': Move up\n\n3. **Simulate Each Move**:\n   - Start at (3, 2) with the number 8.\n   - Move right to (3, 3).\n   - Move down to (4, 3).\n   - Move left to (4, 2).\n   - Move left to (4, 1).\n   - Move up to (3, 1).\n   - Move up to (2, 1).\n\n4. **Apply the '2048' Game Rules**:\n   - During each move, check if the number can combine with another number of the same value.\n   - If a combination occurs, update the grid accordingly.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to simulate the movement and update the grid.\n\n```python\n# Initial grid\ngrid = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 2],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 8, 0, 32],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 4],\n    [4, 32, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Initial position of the number to move\nx, y = 2, 2\n\n# Movement sequence\nmoves = 'rdlluu'\n\n# Function to perform a move\ndef move(x, y, direction):\n    if direction == 'r':\n        return x, y + 1\n    elif direction == 'd':\n        return x + 1, y\n    elif direction == 'l':\n        return x, y - 1\n    elif direction == 'u':\n        return x - 1, y\n    return x, y\n\n# Simulate the movement\nfor move_direction in moves:\n    new_x, new_y = move(x, y, move_direction)\n    if grid[new_x][new_y] == grid[x][y]:\n        # Combine numbers\n        grid[new_x][new_y] *= 2\n        grid[x][y] = 0\n    elif grid[new_x][new_y] == 0:\n        # Move to the new position\n        grid[new_x][new_y] = grid[x][y]\n        grid[x][y] = 0\n    # Update position\n    x, y = new_x, new_y\n\n# Print the final grid\nprint(grid)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to see the final state of the grid after the movement sequence.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the final state of the grid after applying the movement sequence 'rdlluu' is as follows:\n\n<<<[[0, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 32], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4], [4, 32, 0, 0, 0]]>>>"
