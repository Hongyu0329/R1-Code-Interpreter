  "question": "In an 2x2 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (2, 2) using the sequence 'rl':\n16, 4\n32, 8\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (2, 2) according to the given sequence 'rl'. The initial matrix is:\n\n```\n16, 4\n32, 8\n```\n\nThe position (2, 2) contains the number 8. We will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Move Right ('r')**: Since the number is already at the rightmost position in its row, moving right will not change its position. The matrix remains the same.\n\n2. **Move Left ('l')**: The number 8 at position (2, 2) will move to position (2, 1). The number 32 at position (2, 1) will be pushed to position (2, 2). Since 8 and 32 are not the same, they do not combine.\n\nLet's simulate this process using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [16, 4],\n    [32, 8]\n]\n\n# Move sequence\nmoves = 'rl'\n\n# Function to move right\ndef move_right(matrix):\n    for i in range(2):\n        if matrix[i][1] == 0:\n            matrix[i][1] = matrix[i][0]\n            matrix[i][0] = 0\n        elif matrix[i][0] == matrix[i][1]:\n            matrix[i][1] *= 2\n            matrix[i][0] = 0\n    return matrix\n\n# Function to move left\ndef move_left(matrix):\n    for i in range(2):\n        if matrix[i][0] == 0:\n            matrix[i][0] = matrix[i][1]\n            matrix[i][1] = 0\n        elif matrix[i][0] == matrix[i][1]:\n            matrix[i][0] *= 2\n            matrix[i][1] = 0\n    return matrix\n\n# Apply moves\nfor move in moves:\n    if move == 'r':\n        matrix = move_right(matrix)\n    elif move == 'l':\n        matrix = move_left(matrix)\n\n# Print the final matrix\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final state of the matrix after the moves.",
