  "question": "In an 3x3 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (2, 3) using the sequence 'lrr':\n16, 4, 0\n0, 2, 0\n32, 2, 4\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (2, 3) according to the sequence 'lrr'. The initial matrix is:\n\n```\n16, 4, 0\n0, 2, 0\n32, 2, 4\n```\n\nThe number at position (2, 3) is 4. We will move this number according to the sequence 'lrr':\n\n1. **Move Left (l):** The number 4 at position (2, 3) moves to position (2, 2). Since the number at (2, 2) is 2, which is different, they do not combine. The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   16, 4, 0\n   0, 2, 4\n   32, 2, 0\n   ```\n\n2. **Move Right (r):** The number 4 at position (2, 2) moves to position (2, 3). The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   16, 4, 0\n   0, 2, 0\n   32, 2, 4\n   ```\n\n3. **Move Right (r):** The number 4 at position (2, 3) cannot move further right as it is already at the edge of the grid. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   16, 4, 0\n   0, 2, 0\n   32, 2, 4\n   ```\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in Python to ensure the steps are correctly followed:\n\n```python\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [16, 4, 0],\n    [0, 2, 0],\n    [32, 2, 4]\n]\n\n# Initial position of the number to move\nrow, col = 2, 2  # 0-indexed, corresponds to (2, 3) in 1-indexed\n\n# Sequence of moves\nmoves = 'lrr'\n\n# Function to perform the move\ndef move_number(matrix, row, col, direction):\n    if direction == 'l' and col > 0:\n        # Move left\n        if matrix[row][col - 1] == matrix[row][col]:\n            matrix[row][col - 1] *= 2\n            matrix[row][col] = 0\n        elif matrix[row][col - 1] == 0:\n            matrix[row][col - 1] = matrix[row][col]\n            matrix[row][col] = 0\n        col -= 1\n    elif direction == 'r' and col < 2:\n        # Move right\n        if matrix[row][col + 1] == matrix[row][col]:\n            matrix[row][col + 1] *= 2\n            matrix[row][col] = 0\n        elif matrix[row][col + 1] == 0:\n            matrix[row][col + 1] = matrix[row][col]\n            matrix[row][col] = 0\n        col += 1\n    return row, col\n\n# Apply the sequence of moves\nfor move in moves:\n    row, col = move_number(matrix, row, col, move)\n\n# Print the final matrix\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to see the final matrix after the moves.",
