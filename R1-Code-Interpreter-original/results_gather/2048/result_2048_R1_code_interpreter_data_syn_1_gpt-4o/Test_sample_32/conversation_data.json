  "question": "In an 3x3 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (3, 2) using the sequence 'uur':\n0, 0, 0\n0, 8, 0\n32, 32, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (3, 2) according to the sequence 'uur'. The initial matrix is:\n\n```\n0, 0, 0\n0, 8, 0\n32, 32, 0\n```\n\nThe number at position (3, 2) is 32. We will move it according to the sequence 'uur':\n\n1. **First 'u' (up):** Move the number at (3, 2) to (2, 2). The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   0, 0, 0\n   0, 32, 0\n   32, 0, 0\n   ```\n\n2. **Second 'u' (up):** Move the number at (2, 2) to (1, 2). The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   0, 32, 0\n   0, 0, 0\n   32, 0, 0\n   ```\n\n3. **'r' (right):** Move the number at (1, 2) to (1, 3). The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   0, 0, 32\n   0, 0, 0\n   32, 0, 0\n   ```\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in Python to ensure the steps are correct.\n\n```python\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 8, 0],\n    [32, 32, 0]\n]\n\n# Move sequence\nmoves = 'uur'\n\n# Initial position of the number to move\nposition = (2, 1)  # (row, column) in 0-indexed\n\n# Function to move the number in the matrix\ndef move_number(matrix, position, moves):\n    for move in moves:\n        row, col = position\n        if move == 'u':\n            new_position = (row - 1, col)\n        elif move == 'd':\n            new_position = (row + 1, col)\n        elif move == 'l':\n            new_position = (row, col - 1)\n        elif move == 'r':\n            new_position = (row, col + 1)\n        \n        # Move the number\n        matrix[new_position[0]][new_position[1]] = matrix[row][col]\n        matrix[row][col] = 0\n        position = new_position\n    \n    return matrix\n\n# Apply the moves\nresult_matrix = move_number(matrix, position, moves)\n\n# Print the resulting matrix\nprint(result_matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to see the final matrix.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the final matrix after applying the move sequence 'uur' is:\n\n<<<[[0, 0, 32], [0, 0, 0], [32, 0, 0]]>>>"
