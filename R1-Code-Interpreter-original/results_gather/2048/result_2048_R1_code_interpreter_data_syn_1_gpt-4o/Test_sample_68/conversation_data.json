  "question": "In an 5x5 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (2, 5) using the sequence 'udldu':\n0, 16, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 16, 0\n0, 0, 16, 0, 0\n0, 0, 32, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 2\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number located at position (2, 5) in the grid according to the given sequence of moves: 'udldu'. The number at this position is 2. We will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initialize the Grid**: Start with the given 5x5 grid.\n2. **Track the Position**: Keep track of the current position of the number as it moves.\n3. **Simulate the Moves**: For each move in the sequence, update the position of the number and check for possible combinations with adjacent numbers.\n4. **Update the Grid**: After each move, update the grid to reflect the new position and any combinations that occur.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to simulate the moves and update the grid accordingly.\n\n```python\n# Initialize the grid\ngrid = [\n    [0, 16, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 16, 0],\n    [0, 0, 16, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 32, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n]\n\n# Initial position of the number 2\nposition = (4, 4)  # (row, column) in 0-indexed\n\n# Sequence of moves\nmoves = 'udldu'\n\n# Define the move directions\nmove_directions = {\n    'u': (-1, 0),\n    'd': (1, 0),\n    'l': (0, -1),\n    'r': (0, 1)\n}\n\n# Function to perform the move\ndef move_number(grid, position, move):\n    row, col = position\n    d_row, d_col = move_directions[move]\n    new_row, new_col = row + d_row, col + d_col\n    \n    # Check if the new position is within bounds\n    if 0 <= new_row < 5 and 0 <= new_col < 5:\n        # Check if the new position can combine\n        if grid[new_row][new_col] == grid[row][col]:\n            # Combine the numbers\n            grid[new_row][new_col] *= 2\n            grid[row][col] = 0\n        elif grid[new_row][new_col] == 0:\n            # Move the number\n            grid[new_row][new_col] = grid[row][col]\n            grid[row][col] = 0\n        # Update the position\n        position = (new_row, new_col)\n    \n    return grid, position\n\n# Simulate the moves\nfor move in moves:\n    grid, position = move_number(grid, position, move)\n\n# Print the final grid\nprint(grid)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute this code to see the final state of the grid after performing the moves.",
