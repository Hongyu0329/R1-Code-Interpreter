  "question": "In an 5x5 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (1, 5) using the sequence 'rrurl':\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 2, 0, 32\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 16, 0, 0\n16, 2, 0, 0, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (1, 5) according to the given sequence 'rrurl'. The initial position of the number is (1, 5), which contains the number 32. We will follow the sequence of moves and update the grid accordingly.\n\nLet's break down the sequence:\n1. **r (right)**: Move the number from (1, 5) to (1, 5) (no change since it's already at the rightmost column).\n2. **r (right)**: Again, no change since it's already at the rightmost column.\n3. **u (up)**: Move the number from (1, 5) to (0, 5).\n4. **r (right)**: No change since it's already at the rightmost column.\n5. **l (left)**: Move the number from (0, 5) to (0, 4).\n\nWe will implement this logic in a Python script to simulate the moves and update the grid.\n\n```python\n# Initial grid\ngrid = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 2, 0, 32],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 16, 0, 0],\n    [16, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Initial position of the number\nposition = (1, 4)  # (row, column) in 0-indexed\n\n# Sequence of moves\nmoves = 'rrurl'\n\n# Function to move the number in the grid\ndef move_number(grid, position, moves):\n    for move in moves:\n        row, col = position\n        if move == 'r' and col < 4:\n            # Move right\n            if grid[row][col + 1] == grid[row][col]:\n                grid[row][col + 1] *= 2\n                grid[row][col] = 0\n            elif grid[row][col + 1] == 0:\n                grid[row][col + 1] = grid[row][col]\n                grid[row][col] = 0\n            position = (row, col + 1)\n        elif move == 'l' and col > 0:\n            # Move left\n            if grid[row][col - 1] == grid[row][col]:\n                grid[row][col - 1] *= 2\n                grid[row][col] = 0\n            elif grid[row][col - 1] == 0:\n                grid[row][col - 1] = grid[row][col]\n                grid[row][col] = 0\n            position = (row, col - 1)\n        elif move == 'u' and row > 0:\n            # Move up\n            if grid[row - 1][col] == grid[row][col]:\n                grid[row - 1][col] *= 2\n                grid[row][col] = 0\n            elif grid[row - 1][col] == 0:\n                grid[row - 1][col] = grid[row][col]\n                grid[row][col] = 0\n            position = (row - 1, col)\n        elif move == 'd' and row < 4:\n            # Move down\n            if grid[row + 1][col] == grid[row][col]:\n                grid[row + 1][col] *= 2\n                grid[row][col] = 0\n            elif grid[row + 1][col] == 0:\n                grid[row + 1][col] = grid[row][col]\n                grid[row][col] = 0\n            position = (row + 1, col)\n    return grid\n\n# Apply the moves\nresult_grid = move_number(grid, position, moves)\n\n# Print the resulting grid\nprint(result_grid)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the resulting grid after the moves.",
