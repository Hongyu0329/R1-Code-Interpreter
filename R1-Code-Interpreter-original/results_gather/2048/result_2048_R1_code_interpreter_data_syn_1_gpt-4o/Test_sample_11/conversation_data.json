  "question": "In an 2x2 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (1, 1) using the sequence 'lr':\n4, 4\n8, 8\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (1, 1) according to the given sequence 'lr'. The initial matrix is:\n\n```\n4, 4\n8, 8\n```\n\nThe sequence 'lr' means we first move left and then right. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Position**: The number at position (1, 1) is 4.\n2. **Move Left ('l')**: Since the number is already at the leftmost position in its row, moving left doesn't change its position. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   4, 4\n   8, 8\n   ```\n3. **Move Right ('r')**: Now, we move the number at position (1, 1) to the right. The number 4 at (1, 1) moves to (1, 2). Since the number at (1, 2) is also 4, they combine to form 8. The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   0, 8\n   8, 8\n   ```\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to verify the result.\n\n```python\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [4, 4],\n    [8, 8]\n]\n\n# Move sequence\nsequence = 'lr'\n\n# Function to move left\ndef move_left(matrix):\n    for i in range(2):\n        if matrix[i][0] == matrix[i][1]:\n            matrix[i][0] = 0\n            matrix[i][1] *= 2\n    return matrix\n\n# Function to move right\ndef move_right(matrix):\n    for i in range(2):\n        if matrix[i][1] == matrix[i][0]:\n            matrix[i][1] = 0\n            matrix[i][0] *= 2\n    return matrix\n\n# Apply the sequence\nfor move in sequence:\n    if move == 'l':\n        matrix = move_left(matrix)\n    elif move == 'r':\n        matrix = move_right(matrix)\n\n# Print the final matrix\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to see the final matrix.",

We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (1, 1) using the sequence 'lr':\n4, 4\n8, 8\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",
