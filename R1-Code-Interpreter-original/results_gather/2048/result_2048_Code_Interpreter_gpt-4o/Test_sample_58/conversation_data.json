  "question": "In an 4x4 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (2, 2) using the sequence 'rrud':\n0, 4, 8, 0\n0, 2, 0, 0\n0, 32, 2, 0\n2, 4, 0, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'rrud' for the number at position (2, 2) in the given 4x4 grid. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Position**: The number at position (2, 2) is 2.\n2. **Move 'r' (right)**: Move the number 2 from (2, 2) to (2, 3).\n3. **Move 'r' (right)**: Move the number 2 from (2, 3) to (2, 4).\n4. **Move 'u' (up)**: Move the number 2 from (2, 4) to (1, 4).\n5. **Move 'd' (down)**: Move the number 2 from (1, 4) to (2, 4).\n\nDuring these moves, we need to check if the number can combine with another number of the same power of 2.
