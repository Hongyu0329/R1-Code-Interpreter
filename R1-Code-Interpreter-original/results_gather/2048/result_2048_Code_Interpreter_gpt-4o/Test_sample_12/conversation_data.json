  "question": "In an 2x2 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (1, 2) using the sequence 'uu':\n8, 32\n0, 2\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'uu' for the number in position (1, 2) of the matrix:\n\nInitial matrix:\n```\n8, 32\n0, 2\n```\n\nThe number in position (1, 2) is 2. We will move it up twice according to the sequence 'uu':\n\n1. First move 'u' (up):\n   - The number 2 moves from position (1, 2) to position (0, 2).\n   - The matrix becomes:\n     ```\n     8, 32\n     0, 0\n     ```\n\n2. Second move 'u' (up):\n   - The number 2 moves from position (0, 2) to position (0, 1).\n   - Since it encounters the number 32, which is a different power of 2, it remains unchanged.\n   - The matrix becomes:\n     ```\n     8, 32\n     0, 0\n     ```\n\nThe final matrix after performing the moves is:\n```\n<<<8, 32; 0, 0>>>\n```"
