  "question": "In an 5x5 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (4, 2) using the sequence 'llrul':\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n16, 0, 8, 32, 0\n0, 8, 32, 0, 0\n16, 8, 0, 0, 0\n0, 32, 0, 2, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",
