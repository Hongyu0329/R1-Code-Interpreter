  "question": "In an 4x4 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (1, 4) using the sequence 'lrud':\n2, 4, 32, 0\n0, 0, 16, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0\n2, 8, 0, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'lrud' for the number in position (1, 4) of the grid. Let's break down each step:\n\n1. **Initial Grid:**\n   ```\n   2, 4, 32, 0\n   0, 0, 16, 0\n   0, 0, 0, 0\n   2, 8, 0, 0\n   ```\n\n2. **Initial Position of the Number:**\n   - The number at position (1, 4) is `0`.\n\n3. **Move Sequence:**\n   - **l (left):** Move the number at (1, 4) to (1, 3). Since the number is `0`, the grid remains unchanged.\n   - **r (right):** Move the number at (1, 3) to (1, 4). Again, since the number is `0`, the grid remains unchanged.\n   - **u (up):** Move the number at (1, 4) to (0, 4). The number is `0`, so the grid remains unchanged.\n   - **d (down):** Move the number at (0, 4) to (1, 4). The number is `0`, so the grid remains unchanged.\n\nSince the number at position (1, 4) is `0`, and moving `0` does not affect the grid, the grid remains unchanged after the sequence of moves.\n\nTherefore, the final grid is:\n\n```\n<<<\n2, 4, 32, 0\n0, 0, 16, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0\n2, 8, 0, 0\n>>>\n```"
