  "question": "In an 4x4 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (4, 2) using the sequence 'uddd':\n0, 0, 0, 32\n0, 8, 0, 0\n0, 0, 16, 4\n32, 32, 4, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'uddd' for the number in position (4, 2) of the given matrix. Let's break down each step:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   ```\n   0, 0, 0, 32\n   0, 8, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 16, 4\n   32, 32, 4, 0\n   ```\n\n2. **Initial Position of the Number to Move:**\n   - The number at position (4, 2) is 32.\n\n3. **Move Sequence: 'uddd'**\n\n   - **Move 'u' (up):**\n     - Move the number 32 from (4, 2) to (3, 2).\n     - The matrix becomes:\n       ```\n       0, 0, 0, 32\n       0, 8, 0, 0\n       0, 32, 16, 4\n       32, 0, 4, 0\n       ```\n\n   - **Move 'd' (down):**\n     - Move the number 32 from (3, 2) to (4, 2).\n     - The matrix becomes:\n       ```\n       0, 0, 0, 32\n       0, 8, 0, 0\n       0, 0, 16, 4\n       32, 32, 4, 0\n       ```\n\n   - **Move 'd' (down):**\n     - The number 32 is already at the bottom row, so it cannot move further down.\n     - The matrix remains unchanged:\n       ```\n       0, 0, 0, 32\n       0, 8, 0, 0\n       0, 0, 16, 4\n       32, 32, 4, 0\n       ```\n\n   - **Move 'd' (down):**\n     - Again, the number 32 is at the bottom row, so it cannot move further down.\n     - The matrix remains unchanged:\n       ```\n       0, 0, 0, 32\n       0, 8, 0, 0\n       0, 0, 16, 4\n       32, 32, 4, 0\n       ```\n\nAfter following the move sequence 'uddd', the matrix remains unchanged from its initial state. Therefore, the final matrix is:\n\n<<<\n0, 0, 0, 32\n0, 8, 0, 0\n0, 0, 16, 4\n32, 32, 4, 0\n>>>"
