  "question": "In an 3x3 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (3, 2) using the sequence 'uuu':\n0, 0, 0\n4, 32, 0\n0, 4, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to move the number in position (3, 2) using the sequence 'uuu' and apply the rules of the 2048 game. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   ```\n   0, 0, 0\n   4, 32, 0\n   0, 4, 0\n   ```\n\n2. **Initial Position of the Number to Move:**\n   - The number at position (3, 2) is 4.\n\n3. **Move Sequence: 'uuu'**\n   - **First 'u' (up):** Move the number 4 from (3, 2) to (2, 2).\n     - New matrix:\n       ```\n       0, 0, 0\n       4, 32, 0\n       0, 0, 0\n       ```\n   - **Second 'u' (up):** Move the number 4 from (2, 2) to (1, 2).\n     - New matrix:\n       ```\n       0, 4, 0\n       4, 32, 0\n       0, 0, 0\n       ```\n   - **Third 'u' (up):** The number 4 at (1, 2) encounters another 4 at (1, 1). They combine to form 8.\n     - New matrix:\n       ```\n       0, 8, 0\n       0, 32, 0\n       0, 0, 0\n       ```\n\nLet's represent the final matrix in the required format. \n\n```\n<<<0, 8, 0; 0, 32, 0; 0, 0, 0>>>\n```"
