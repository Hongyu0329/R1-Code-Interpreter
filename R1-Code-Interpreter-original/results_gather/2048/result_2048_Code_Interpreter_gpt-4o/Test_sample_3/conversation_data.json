  "question": "In an 2x2 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (2, 2) using the sequence 'ur':\n32, 2\n32, 4\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'ur' (up, then right) for the number in position (2, 2) of the matrix:\n\nInitial matrix:\n```\n32, 2\n32, 4\n```\n\n1. **Move 'u' (up):**\n   - The number at position (2, 2) is 4. When we move it up, it will go to position (1, 2).\n   - The number at position (1, 2) is 2. Since 4 and 2 are not the same, they do not combine.\n   - The matrix after the 'u' move:\n     ```\n     32, 4\n     32, 0\n     ```\n\n2. **Move 'r' (right):**\n   - The number at position (1, 2) is 4. When we move it right, it will stay in the same position because it is already at the rightmost column.\n   - The matrix remains unchanged after the 'r' move:\n     ```\n     32, 4\n     32, 0\n     ```\n\nTherefore, the final matrix after performing the sequence 'ur' is:\n\n<<<32, 4; 32, 0>>>"
