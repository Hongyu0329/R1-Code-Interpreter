  "question": "In an 2x2 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (2, 1) using the sequence 'rr':\n8, 8\n8, 32\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "\nassistant > To solve this, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'rr' (right, right) for the number in position (2, 1) of the matrix:\n\nInitial matrix:\n```\n8, 8\n8, 32\n```\n\n1. **First move (r):** Move the number in position (2, 1) to the right.\n   - The number 8 in position (2, 1) moves to position (2, 2).\n   - The number 32 in position (2, 2) remains unchanged.\n   - Since 8 and 32 are different, they do not combine.\n\n   Resulting matrix after the first move:\n   ```\n   8, 8\n   0, 8 + 32\n   ```\n\n   Simplifying:\n   ```\n   8, 8\n   0, 40\n   ```\n\n2. **Second move (r):** Move the number in position (2, 2) to the right.\n   - The number 40 in position (2, 2) cannot move further right as it is already at the edge of the grid.\n\n   The matrix remains unchanged after the second move:\n   ```\n   8, 8\n   0, 40\n   ```\n\nTherefore, the final matrix after applying the sequence 'rr' is:\n```\n<<<8, 8; 0, 40>>>\n```"
