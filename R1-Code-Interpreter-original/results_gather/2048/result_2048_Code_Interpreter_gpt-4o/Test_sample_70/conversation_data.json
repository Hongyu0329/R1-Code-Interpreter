  "question": "In an 5x5 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (4, 3) using the sequence 'ddddd':\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 16\n32, 8, 0, 0, 0\n4, 0, 0, 16, 0\n8, 0, 0, 0, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to move the number in position (4, 3) using the sequence 'ddddd'. The initial position (4, 3) corresponds to the number 0 in the given matrix. Since the number is 0, moving it in any direction will not change the matrix, as 0 does not combine with any other number.\n\nLet's verify this by applying the sequence of moves to the matrix:\n\nInitial matrix:\n```\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 16\n32, 8, 0, 0, 0\n4, 0, 0, 16, 0\n8, 0, 0, 0, 0\n```\n\nAfter applying the sequence 'ddddd', the matrix remains unchanged because the number at position (4, 3) is 0.\n\nFinal matrix:\n```\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 16\n32, 8, 0, 0, 0\n4, 0, 0, 16, 0\n8, 0, 0, 0, 0\n```\n\nTherefore, the matrix after moving is:\n\n<<<\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 16\n32, 8, 0, 0, 0\n4, 0, 0, 16, 0\n8, 0, 0, 0, 0\n>>>"
