  "question": "In an 2x2 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (1, 1) using the sequence 'du':\n8, 32\n8, 32\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'du' (down, then up) for the number in position (1, 1) of the matrix:\n\nInitial matrix:\n```\n8, 32\n8, 32\n```\n\n1. **Move 'd' (down):**\n   - The number at position (1, 1) is 8.\n   - Moving down, the 8 at (1, 1) will combine with the 8 at (2, 1) to form 16.\n   - The matrix becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 32\n     16, 32\n     ```\n\n2. **Move 'u' (up):**\n   - The number at position (2, 1) is now 16.\n   - Moving up, the 16 at (2, 1) will move to (1, 1) since there is no 16 at (1, 1) to combine with.\n   - The matrix becomes:\n     ```\n     16, 32\n     0, 32\n     ```\n\nThus, after performing the sequence 'du', the matrix is:\n\n<<<16, 32; 0, 32>>>"
