  "question": "In an 5x5 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (4, 5) using the sequence 'rdrrl':\n0, 16, 0, 32, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n32, 2, 8, 32, 0\n0, 32, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'rdrrl' starting from the position (4, 5) in the given matrix. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Position**: (4, 5) with value 0.\n2. **Move 'r' (right)**: Since the current position is (4, 5), moving right is not possible as it is already at the rightmost column. The position remains (4, 5).\n3. **Move 'd' (down)**: Moving down from (4, 5) is not possible as it is already at the bottom row. The position remains (4, 5).\n4. **Move 'r' (right)**: Again, moving right from (4, 5) is not possible. The position remains (4, 5).\n5. **Move 'r' (right)**: Once more, moving right from (4, 5) is not possible. The position remains (4, 5).\n6. **Move 'l' (left)**: Moving left from (4, 5) results in the position (4, 4).\n\nSince the initial value at (4, 5) is 0, and no valid moves were made that could change the grid, the matrix remains unchanged. Let's represent the matrix in the required format:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 16 & 0 & 32 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n32 & 2 & 8 & 32 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 32 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThus, the matrix after the sequence of moves is:\n\n<<<\n0, 16, 0, 32, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n32, 2, 8, 32, 0\n0, 32, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n>>>"
