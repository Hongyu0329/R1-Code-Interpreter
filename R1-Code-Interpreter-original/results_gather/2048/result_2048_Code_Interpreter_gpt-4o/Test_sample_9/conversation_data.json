  "question": "In an 2x2 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (1, 1) using the sequence 'ur':\n8, 0\n4, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'ur' (up, then right) for the number in position (1, 1) of the matrix:\n\nInitial matrix:\n```\n8, 0\n4, 0\n```\n\n1. **Move 'u' (up):**\n   - The number 8 at position (1, 1) moves up to position (0, 1).\n   - The matrix becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 8\n     4, 0\n     ```\n\n2. **Move 'r' (right):**\n   - The number 8 at position (0, 1) moves right to position (0, 2). However, since the grid is 2x2, the number cannot move right from position (0, 1) as it is already at the rightmost column. Therefore, the number remains in its position.\n   - The matrix remains:\n     ```\n     0, 8\n     4, 0\n     ```\n\nThus, after applying the sequence 'ur', the matrix is:\n\n```\n<<<\n0, 8\n4, 0\n>>>\n```"
