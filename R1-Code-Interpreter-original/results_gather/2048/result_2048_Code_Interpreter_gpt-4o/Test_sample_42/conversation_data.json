  "question": "In an 4x4 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32.

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'urdu' for the number in position (4, 4) of the grid. Let's break down each move:\n\n1. **Initial Grid:**\n   ```\n   0, 0, 4, 0\n   0, 0, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 4, 0\n   2, 0, 16, 16\n   ```\n\n2. **Move 'u' (up):**\n   - The number 16 at position (4, 4) moves up to position (3, 4).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 4, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 4, 16\n     2, 0, 16, 0\n     ```\n\n3. **Move 'r' (right):**\n   - The number 16 at position (3, 4) cannot move right as it is already at the rightmost column.\n   - The grid remains unchanged:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 4, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 4, 16\n     2, 0, 16, 0\n     ```\n\n4. **Move 'd' (down):**\n   - The number 16 at position (3, 4) moves down to position (4, 4).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 4, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 4, 0\n     2, 0, 16, 16\n     ```\n\n5. **Move 'u' (up):**\n   - The number 16 at position (4, 4) moves up to position (3, 4).\n   - The number 16 at position (3, 4) combines with the number 16 at position (3, 3) to form 32.\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 4, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 4, 32\n     2, 0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\nNow, let's represent the final grid in the required format:\n\n<<<\n0, 0, 4, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 4, 32\n2, 0, 0, 0\n>>>"
