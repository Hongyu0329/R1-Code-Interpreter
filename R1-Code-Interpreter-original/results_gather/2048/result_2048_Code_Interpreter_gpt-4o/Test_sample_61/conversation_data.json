  "question": "In an 5x5 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (1, 2) using the sequence 'urdrl':\n0, 0, 0, 0, 8\n0, 32, 4, 8, 0\n4, 0, 0, 0, 0\n32, 0, 0, 0, 8\n0, 0, 0, 2, 32\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'urdrl' starting from the position (1, 2) in the given matrix. Let's break down each move and update the matrix accordingly:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   ```\n   0, 0, 0, 0, 8\n   0, 32, 4, 8, 0\n   4, 0, 0, 0, 0\n   32, 0, 0, 0, 8\n   0, 0, 0, 2, 32\n   ```\n\n2. **Starting Position:** (1, 2) with value 4.\n\n3. **Move 'u' (up):** Move the number at (1, 2) to (0, 2).\n   - The number 4 moves to (0, 2).\n   - Updated Matrix:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 4, 0, 8\n     0, 32, 0, 8, 0\n     4, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     32, 0, 0, 0, 8\n     0, 0, 0, 2, 32\n     ```\n\n4. **Move 'r' (right):** Move the number at (0, 2) to (0, 3).\n   - The number 4 moves to (0, 3).\n   - Updated Matrix:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 4, 8\n     0, 32, 0, 8, 0\n     4, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     32, 0, 0, 0, 8\n     0, 0, 0, 2, 32\n     ```\n\n5. **Move 'd' (down):** Move the number at (0, 3) to (1, 3).\n   - The number 4 moves to (1, 3) and combines with 8 to form 16.\n   - Updated Matrix:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 8\n     0, 32, 0, 16, 0\n     4, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     32, 0, 0, 0, 8\n     0, 0, 0, 2, 32\n     ```\n\n6. **Move 'r' (right):** Move the number at (1, 3) to (1, 4).\n   - The number 16 moves to (1, 4).\n   - Updated Matrix:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 8\n     0, 32, 0, 0, 16\n     4, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     32, 0, 0, 0, 8\n     0, 0, 0, 2, 32\n     ```\n\n7. **Move 'l' (left):** Move the number at (1, 4) to (1, 3).\n   - The number 16 moves to (1, 3).\n   - Final Matrix:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 8\n     0, 32, 0, 16, 0\n     4, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     32, 0, 0, 0, 8\n     0, 0, 0, 2, 32\n     ```\n\nThe final matrix after performing the sequence of moves is:\n\n<<<\n0, 0, 0, 0, 8\n0, 32, 0, 16, 0\n4, 0, 0, 0, 0\n32, 0, 0, 0, 8\n0, 0, 0, 2, 32\n>>>"
