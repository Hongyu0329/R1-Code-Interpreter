  "question": "In an 3x3 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (3, 2) using the sequence 'uur':\n0, 0, 0\n0, 8, 0\n32, 32, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'uur' for the number in position (3, 2), which is 32. Let's break down the moves:\n\n1. **First 'u' (up):** Move the number at position (3, 2) to position (2, 2).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0\n     0, 32, 0\n     32, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n2. **Second 'u' (up):** Move the number at position (2, 2) to position (1, 2).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 32, 0\n     0, 0, 0\n     32, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n3. **'r' (right):** Move the number at position (1, 2) to position (1, 3).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 32\n     0, 0, 0\n     32, 0, 0\n     ```\n\nNow, let's represent the final grid in the required format. \n\nThe final matrix is:\n```\n<<<0, 0, 32\n0, 0, 0\n32, 0, 0>>>\n```"
