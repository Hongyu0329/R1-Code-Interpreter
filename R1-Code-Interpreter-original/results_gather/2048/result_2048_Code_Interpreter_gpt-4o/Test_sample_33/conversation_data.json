  "question": "In an 3x3 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (2, 3) using the sequence 'lll':\n8, 0, 4\n32, 16, 16\n0, 0, 2\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to move the number in position (2, 3) using the sequence 'lll' (left, left, left) and apply the rules of the 2048 game. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Start with the initial matrix:\n   ```\n   8, 0, 4\n   32, 16, 16\n   0, 0, 2\n   ```\n\n2. The number at position (2, 3) is 2. We need to move it left three times.\n\n3. First move ('l'):\n   - Move the 2 from position (2, 3) to (2, 2).\n   - The matrix becomes:\n     ```\n     8, 0, 4\n     32, 16, 16\n     0, 2, 0\n     ```\n\n4. Second move ('l'):\n   - Move the 2 from position (2, 2) to (2, 1).\n   - The matrix becomes:\n     ```\n     8, 0, 4\n     32, 16, 16\n     2, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n5. Third move ('l'):\n   - The 2 is already at the leftmost position in its row, so it remains in position (2, 1).\n   - The matrix remains:\n     ```\n     8, 0, 4\n     32, 16, 16\n     2, 0, 0\n     ```\n\nNow, let's represent the final matrix in the required format.\nassistant > The final matrix after moving the number in position (2, 3) using the sequence 'lll' is:\n\n```\n<<<\n8, 0, 4\n32, 16, 16\n2, 0, 0\n>>>\n```"
