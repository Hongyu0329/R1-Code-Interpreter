  "question": "In an 2x2 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (1, 1) using the sequence 'dr':\n8, 32\n0, 16\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'dr' (down, right) for the number in position (1, 1) of the matrix. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   ```\n   8, 32\n   0, 16\n   ```\n\n2. **Move 'd' (down):**\n   - The number 8 at position (1, 1) moves down to position (2, 1).\n   - The matrix becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 32\n     8, 16\n     ```\n\n3. **Move 'r' (right):**\n   - The number 8 at position (2, 1) moves right to position (2, 2).\n   - Since 8 and 16 are different powers of 2, they do not combine.\n   - The matrix becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 32\n     0, 8\n     ```\n\nThus, the final matrix after performing the moves 'dr' is:\n\n```\n<<<0, 32; 0, 8>>>\n```"
