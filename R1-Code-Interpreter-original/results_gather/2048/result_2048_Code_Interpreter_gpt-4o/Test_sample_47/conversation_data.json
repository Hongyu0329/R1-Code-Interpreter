  "question": "In an 4x4 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (4, 4) using the sequence 'ddud':\n16, 8, 0, 2\n0, 0, 32, 0\n0, 4, 32, 0\n0, 32, 0, 2\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (4, 4) according to the sequence 'ddud'. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n\n   ```\n   16, 8, 0, 2\n   0, 0, 32, 0\n   0, 4, 32, 0\n   0, 32, 0, 2\n   ```\n\n   The number at position (4, 4) is 2.\n\n2. **Move 'd' (down):**\n\n   - The number 2 moves from (4, 4) to (3, 4).\n   - The matrix becomes:\n\n     ```\n     16, 8, 0, 2\n     0, 0, 32, 0\n     0, 4, 32, 2\n     0, 32, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n3. **Move 'd' (down):**\n\n   - The number 2 moves from (3, 4) to (2, 4).\n   - The matrix becomes:\n\n     ```\n     16, 8, 0, 2\n     0, 0, 32, 2\n     0, 4, 32, 0\n     0, 32, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n4. **Move 'u' (up):**\n\n   - The number 2 moves from (2, 4) to (3, 4).\n   - The matrix becomes:\n\n     ```\n     16, 8, 0, 2\n     0, 0, 32, 0\n     0, 4, 32, 2\n     0, 32, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n5. **Move 'd' (down):**\n\n   - The number 2 moves from (3, 4) to (2, 4).\n   - The matrix becomes:\n\n     ```\n     16, 8, 0, 2\n     0, 0, 32, 2\n     0, 4, 32, 0\n     0, 32, 0, 0\n     ```\n\nThe final matrix after performing the sequence 'ddud' is:\n\n```\n16, 8, 0, 2\n0, 0, 32, 2\n0, 4, 32, 0\n0, 32, 0, 0\n```\n\nThus, the matrix after moving is:\n\n<<<16, 8, 0, 2; 0, 0, 32, 2; 0, 4, 32, 0; 0, 32, 0, 0>>>"
