  "question": "In an 3x3 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (3, 3) using the sequence 'lrl':\n32, 0, 0\n2, 4, 0\n32, 0, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'lrl' for the number in position (3, 3) of the grid. Let's break down each move step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   ```\n   32, 0, 0\n   2, 4, 0\n   32, 0, 0\n   ```\n\n2. **Move 'l' (left):**\n   - The number at position (3, 3) is 0, so moving left will not change the matrix.\n   - The matrix remains:\n     ```\n     32, 0, 0\n     2, 4, 0\n     32, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n3. **Move 'r' (right):**\n   - The number at position (3, 3) is still 0, so moving right will not change the matrix.\n   - The matrix remains:\n     ```\n     32, 0, 0\n     2, 4, 0\n     32, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n4. **Move 'l' (left):**\n   - The number at position (3, 3) is still 0, so moving left will not change the matrix.\n   - The matrix remains:\n     ```\n     32, 0, 0\n     2, 4, 0\n     32, 0, 0\n     ```\n\nSince the number at position (3, 3) is 0, it does not affect the matrix during the moves. Therefore, the matrix remains unchanged.\n\nThe final matrix is:\n```\n<<<32, 0, 0\n2, 4, 0\n32, 0, 0>>>\n```"
