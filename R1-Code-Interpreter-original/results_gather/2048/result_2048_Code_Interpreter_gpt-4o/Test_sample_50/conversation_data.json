  "question": "In an 4x4 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (4, 1) using the sequence 'udul':\n4, 8, 0, 8\n16, 0, 0, 0\n16, 2, 0, 0\n0, 32, 16, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'udul' for the number in position (4, 1) of the given matrix. Let's break down each move step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   ```\n   4, 8, 0, 8\n   16, 0, 0, 0\n   16, 2, 0, 0\n   0, 32, 16, 0\n   ```\n\n2. **Initial Position of the Number to Move:**\n   - The number at position (4, 1) is `0`.\n\n3. **Move Sequence: 'udul'**\n\n   - **Move 'u' (up):** \n     - The number at (4, 1) moves to (3, 1).\n     - The number at (3, 1) is `16`.\n     - Since the number to move is `0`, it remains `0`.\n\n   - **Move 'd' (down):**\n     - The number at (3, 1) moves back to (4, 1).\n     - The number at (4, 1) is `0`.\n     - Since the number to move is `0`, it remains `0`.\n\n   - **Move 'u' (up):**\n     - The number at (4, 1) moves to (3, 1).\n     - The number at (3, 1) is `16`.\n     - Since the number to move is `0`, it remains `0`.\n\n   - **Move 'l' (left):**\n     - The number at (3, 1) moves to (3, 0).\n     - The number at (3, 0) is `16`.\n     - Since the number to move is `0`, it remains `0`.\n\nSince the number to move is `0`, it does not affect the matrix during the moves. Therefore, the matrix remains unchanged.\n\nThe final matrix is:\n```\n4, 8, 0, 8\n16, 0, 0, 0\n16, 2, 0, 0\n0, 32, 16, 0\n```\n\nThus, the matrix after moving is:\n\n<<<4, 8, 0, 8; 16, 0, 0, 0; 16, 2, 0, 0; 0, 32, 16, 0>>>"
