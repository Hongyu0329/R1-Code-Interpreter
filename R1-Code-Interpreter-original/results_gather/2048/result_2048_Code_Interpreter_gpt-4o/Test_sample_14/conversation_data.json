  "question": "In an 2x2 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (2, 2) using the sequence 'dl':\n0, 8\n2, 2\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'dl' (down, left) for the number in position (2, 2) in the given 2x2 grid:\n\nInitial grid:\n```\n0, 8\n2, 2\n```\n\n1. **Move 'd' (down):** Since the number in position (2, 2) is already at the bottom row, moving down doesn't change its position. The grid remains:\n   ```\n   0, 8\n   2, 2\n   ```\n\n2. **Move 'l' (left):** Now, we move the number in position (2, 2) to the left. The number 2 in position (2, 2) moves to position (2, 1), where it encounters another 2. These two numbers combine to form 4 (since 2 + 2 = 4). The grid becomes:\n   ```\n   0, 8\n   4, 0\n   ```\n\nThus, after applying the sequence 'dl', the final grid is:\n```\n<<<0, 8\n4, 0>>>\n```"
