  "question": "In an 5x5 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (3, 2) using the sequence 'rdlluu':\n0, 0, 0, 0, 2\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 8, 0, 32\n0, 0, 0, 0, 4\n4, 32, 0, 0, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (3, 2) according to the sequence 'rdlluu'. Let's break down the sequence and apply each move step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Position**: (3, 2) with the number 8.\n2. **Move 'r' (right)**: Move to (3, 3).\n3. **Move 'd' (down)**: Move to (4, 3).\n4. **Move 'l' (left)**: Move to (4, 2).\n5. **Move 'l' (left)**: Move to (4, 1).\n6. **Move 'u' (up)**: Move to (3, 1).\n7. **Move 'u' (up)**: Move to (2, 1).\n\nDuring these moves, if the number encounters another number that is the same power of 2, they will combine to form the next power of 2.
