  "question": "In an 4x4 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (3, 2) using the sequence 'rrll':\n2, 0, 8, 2\n0, 16, 0, 0\n0, 0, 8, 4\n0, 16, 32, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (3, 2) according to the sequence 'rrll'. The initial matrix is:\n\n```\n2, 0, 8, 2\n0, 16, 0, 0\n0, 0, 8, 4\n0, 16, 32, 0\n```\n\nThe number at position (3, 2) is 0. We will follow the sequence of moves:\n\n1. **Move Right (r):** The number at (3, 2) moves to (3, 3). Since (3, 3) contains 8, and the number moving is 0, there is no change.\n2. **Move Right (r):** The number at (3, 3) moves to (3, 4). Since (3, 4) contains 4, and the number moving is 0, there is no change.\n3. **Move Left (l):** The number at (3, 4) moves to (3, 3). Since (3, 3) contains 8, and the number moving is 0, there is no change.\n4. **Move Left (l):** The number at (3, 3) moves to (3, 2). Since (3, 2) contains 0, and the number moving is 0, there is no change.\n\nSince the number being moved is 0, it does not affect the grid during the moves. Therefore, the matrix remains unchanged after the sequence of moves.\n\nThe final matrix is:\n\n```\n2, 0, 8, 2\n0, 16, 0, 0\n0, 0, 8, 4\n0, 16, 32, 0\n```\n\nThus, the matrix after moving is:\n\n<<<\n[[2, 0, 8, 2],\n [0, 16, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 8, 4],\n [0, 16, 32, 0]]\n>>>"
