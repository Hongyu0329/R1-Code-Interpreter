    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number located at position (2, 4) in the given 5x5 grid according to the sequence 'rlulur'. The number at this position is 8. We will follow the sequence of moves and apply the rules of the '2048' game to update the grid accordingly.\n\nLet's break down the sequence of moves:\n\n1. **r (right)**: Move the number at (2, 4) to (2, 5). Since (2, 5) is out of bounds, the number remains at (2, 4).\n2. **l (left)**: Move the number at (2, 4) to (2, 3). The number at (2, 3) is 0, so the number 8 moves to (2, 3).\n3. **u (up)**: Move the number at (2, 3) to (1, 3). The number at (1, 3) is 8, so they combine to form 16 at (1, 3).\n4. **l (left)**: Move the number at (1, 3) to (1, 2). The number at (1, 2) is 2, so the number 16 moves to (1, 2).\n5. **u (up)**: Move the number at (1, 2) to (0, 2). The number at (0, 2) is 0, so the number 16 moves to (0, 2).\n6. **r (right)**: Move the number at (0, 2) to (0, 3). The number at (0, 3) is 0, so the number 16 moves to (0, 3).\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in a Python script to update the grid and print the final matrix.\n\n```python\n# Initial grid\ngrid = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 2, 8, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 8, 0],\n    [32, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 8, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Initial position of the number to move\nposition = (2, 4)\n\n# Sequence of moves\nmoves = 'rlulur'\n\n# Function to perform a move\ndef move_number(grid, position, direction):\n    x, y = position\n    if direction == 'r':\n        if y < 4 and grid[x][y+1] == 0:\n            grid[x][y+1] = grid[x][y]\n            grid[x][y] = 0\n            y += 1\n    elif direction == 'l':\n        if y > 0 and grid[x][y-1] == 0:\n            grid[x][y-1] = grid[x][y]\n            grid[x][y] = 0\n            y -= 1\n    elif direction == 'u':\n        if x > 0 and grid[x-1][y] == 0:\n            grid[x-1][y] = grid[x][y]\n            grid[x][y] = 0\n            x -= 1\n    elif direction == 'd':\n        if x < 4 and grid[x+1][y] == 0:\n            grid[x+1][y] = grid[x][y]\n            grid[x][y] = 0\n            x += 1\n    return (x, y)\n\n# Function to combine numbers\ndef combine_numbers(grid, position, direction):\n    x, y = position\n    if direction == 'r' and y < 4 and grid[x][y] == grid[x][y+1]:\n        grid[x][y+1] *= 2\n        grid[x][y] = 0\n        y += 1\n    elif direction == 'l' and y > 0 and grid[x][y] == grid[x][y-1]:\n        grid[x][y-1] *= 2\n        grid[x][y] = 0\n        y -= 1\n    elif direction == 'u' and x > 0 and grid[x][y] == grid[x-1][y]:\n        grid[x-1][y] *= 2\n        grid[x][y] = 0\n        x -= 1\n    elif direction == 'd' and x < 4 and grid[x][y] == grid[x+1][y]:\n        grid[x+1][y] *= 2\n        grid[x][y] = 0\n        x += 1\n    return (x, y)\n\n# Process each move\nfor move in moves:\n    position = move_number(grid, position, move)\n    position = combine_numbers(grid, position, move)\n\n# Print the final grid\nprint(grid)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the final matrix.",
