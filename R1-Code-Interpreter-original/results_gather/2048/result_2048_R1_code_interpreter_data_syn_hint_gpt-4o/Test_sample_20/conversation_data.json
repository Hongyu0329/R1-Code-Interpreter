  "question": "In an 3x3 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (2, 3) using the sequence 'ddu':\n0, 2, 0\n0, 32, 0\n0, 8, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (2, 3) according to the given sequence 'ddu'. The initial matrix is:\n\n```\n0, 2, 0\n0, 32, 0\n0, 8, 0\n```\n\nThe number at position (2, 3) is 8. We will move this number according to the sequence:\n\n1. **First move ('d')**: Move down from (2, 3) to (3, 3). The number 8 moves to the bottom row.\n2. **Second move ('d')**: Attempt to move down from (3, 3). Since it's already at the bottom, it cannot move further down.\n3. **Third move ('u')**: Move up from (3, 3) to (2, 3). The number 8 moves back to its original position.\n\nDuring these moves, we need to check if the number can combine with another number. However, in this case, there are no numbers in the path that can combine with 8, so it remains unchanged.\n\nLet's simulate this process using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [0, 2, 0],\n    [0, 32, 0],\n    [0, 8, 0]\n]\n\n# Initial position of the number to move\nposition = (2, 2)  # (row, column) in 0-indexed\n\n# Sequence of moves\nmoves = 'ddu'\n\n# Function to perform a move\ndef move_number(matrix, position, direction):\n    row, col = position\n    if direction == 'd' and row < 2:\n        # Move down\n        if matrix[row + 1][col] == matrix[row][col]:\n            matrix[row + 1][col] *= 2\n            matrix[row][col] = 0\n        elif matrix[row + 1][col] == 0:\n            matrix[row + 1][col] = matrix[row][col]\n            matrix[row][col] = 0\n        row += 1\n    elif direction == 'u' and row > 0:\n        # Move up\n        if matrix[row - 1][col] == matrix[row][col]:\n            matrix[row - 1][col] *= 2\n            matrix[row][col] = 0\n        elif matrix[row - 1][col] == 0:\n            matrix[row - 1][col] = matrix[row][col]\n            matrix[row][col] = 0\n        row -= 1\n    return (row, col)\n\n# Perform the sequence of moves\nfor move in moves:\n    position = move_number(matrix, position, move)\n\n# Print the final matrix\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final state of the matrix.",

    "In an 3x3 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (2, 3) using the sequence 'ddu':\n0, 2, 0\n0, 32, 0\n0, 8, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",
