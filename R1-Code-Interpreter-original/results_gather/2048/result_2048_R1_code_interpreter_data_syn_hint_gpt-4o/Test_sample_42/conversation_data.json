  "question": "In an 4x4 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32.

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (4, 4) according to the sequence 'urdu'. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   ```\n   0, 0, 4, 0\n   0, 0, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 4, 0\n   2, 0, 16, 16\n   ```\n\n2. **Initial Position of the Number:**\n   - The number at position (4, 4) is 16.\n\n3. **Move Sequence: 'urdu'**\n   - **u (up):** Move the number at (4, 4) to (3, 4). The number at (3, 4) is 0, so it becomes 16.\n   - **r (right):** Move the number at (3, 4) to (3, 4) (no change since it's already at the rightmost column).\n   - **d (down):** Move the number at (3, 4) to (4, 4). The number at (4, 4) is 16, so they combine to form 32.\n   - **u (up):** Move the number at (4, 4) to (3, 4).
