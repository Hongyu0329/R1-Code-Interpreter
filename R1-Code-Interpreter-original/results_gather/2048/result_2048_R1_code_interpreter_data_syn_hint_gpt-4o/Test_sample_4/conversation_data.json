  "question": "In an 2x2 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (2, 1) using the sequence 'dd':\n4, 8\n4, 2\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (2, 1) according to the given sequence 'dd'. The initial matrix is:\n\n```\n4, 8\n4, 2\n```\n\nThe sequence 'dd' indicates moving down twice. However, since the grid is only 2x2, moving down from position (2, 1) is not possible because it is already at the bottom row. Therefore, the number in position (2, 1) cannot move further down.\n\nLet's analyze the steps:\n\n1. Start at position (2, 1) with the number 4.\n2. Attempt to move down ('d'):\n   - Since the number is already at the bottom row, it cannot move down.\n3. Attempt to move down again ('d'):\n   - Again, the number cannot move down as it is already at the bottom row.\n\nSince the number cannot move, the matrix remains unchanged. Therefore, the final matrix is:\n\n```\n4, 8\n4, 2\n```\n\nThus, the matrix after attempting the move sequence 'dd' is:\n\n<<<[[4, 8], [4, 2]]>>>"
