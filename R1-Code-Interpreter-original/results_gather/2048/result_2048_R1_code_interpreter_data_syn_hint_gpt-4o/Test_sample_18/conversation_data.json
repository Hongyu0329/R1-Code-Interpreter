  "question": "In an 2x2 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (2, 1) using the sequence 'll':\n0, 4\n16, 4\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the numbers in the grid according to the rules of the '2048' game. The initial grid is:\n\n```\n0, 4\n16, 4\n```\n\nThe sequence of moves is 'll', which means moving left twice. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Grid:**\n   ```\n   0, 4\n   16, 4\n   ```\n\n2. **First Move (l):**\n   - Move all numbers to the left.\n   - The first row becomes `[4, 0]` because the `4` moves left into the `0`.\n   - The second row becomes `[16, 4]` because the `16` and `4` are already on the left.\n\n3. **Second Move (l):**\n   - Move all numbers to the left again.\n   - The first row remains `[4, 0]` because there is no combination possible.\n   - The second row remains `[16, 4]` because there is no combination possible.\n\nThe grid after the sequence 'll' is:\n\n```\n4, 0\n16, 4\n```\n\nThus, the final matrix after performing the moves is:\n\n<<<[[4, 0], [16, 4]]>>>"
