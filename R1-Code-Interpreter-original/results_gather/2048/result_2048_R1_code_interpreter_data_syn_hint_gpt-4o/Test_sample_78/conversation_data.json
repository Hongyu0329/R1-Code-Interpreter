  "question": "In an 5x5 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (5, 2) using the sequence 'lrdlr':\n32, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 4, 4, 2, 0\n0, 2, 0, 0, 0\n0, 8, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (5, 2) according to the given sequence 'lrdlr'.

Let's re-evaluate the problem and approach it with a more detailed plan.\n\n### Problem Understanding\n\nWe need to move the number in position (5, 2) using the sequence 'lrdlr'. The initial matrix is:\n\n```\n32, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 4, 4, 2, 0\n0, 2, 0, 0, 0\n0, 8, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n```\n\nThe number at position (5, 2) is 0, which means there is no number to move. However, the number at position (4, 2) is 8, which seems to be the intended number to move.\n\n### Plan\n\n1. **Identify the Starting Position**: Start with the number 8 at position (4, 2).\n2. **Simulate the Moves**: Follow the sequence 'lrdlr' to move the number.\n3. **Update the Matrix**: After each move, update the matrix to reflect the new position of the number.\n4. **Handle Combinations**: If the number encounters another number of the same value, combine them to form the next power of 2.\n\n### Implementation\n\nLet's implement this plan in code:\n\n```python\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [32, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 4, 4, 2, 0],\n    [0, 2, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 8, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Initial position of the number to move\nposition = (3, 1)  # Adjusted to 0-based index\nvalue = matrix[position[0]][position[1]]\n\n# Sequence of moves\nmoves = 'lrdlr'\n\n# Function to update position based on move\ndef update_position(pos, move):\n    if move == 'l':\n        return (pos[0], max(0, pos[1] - 1))\n    elif move == 'r':\n        return (pos[0], min(4, pos[1] + 1))\n    elif move == 'u':\n        return (max(0, pos[0] - 1), pos[1])\n    elif move == 'd':\n        return (min(4, pos[0] + 1), pos[1])\n\n# Simulate the moves\nfor move in moves:\n    new_position = update_position(position, move)\n    # Check for combination\n    if matrix[new_position[0]][new_position[1]] == value:\n        value *= 2\n        matrix[new_position[0]][new_position[1]] = 0\n    else:\n        # Move the value to the new position\n        matrix[position[0]][position[1]] = 0\n    matrix[new_position[0]][new_position[1]] = value\n    position = new_position\n\n# Print the final matrix\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to see the final matrix.",

    "In an 5x5 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction.
