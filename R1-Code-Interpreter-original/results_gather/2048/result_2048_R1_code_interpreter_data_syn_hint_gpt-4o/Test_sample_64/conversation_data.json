  "question": "In an 5x5 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (5, 2) using the sequence 'lrrur':\n0, 0, 8, 32, 0\n8, 0, 0, 32, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n4, 4, 0, 32, 4\n2, 32, 0, 0, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (5, 2) according to the given sequence 'lrrur'. The initial matrix is:\n\n```\n0, 0, 8, 32, 0\n8, 0, 0, 32, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n4, 4, 0, 32, 4\n2, 32, 0, 0, 0\n```\n\nThe number at position (5, 2) is 32. We will follow the sequence of moves:\n\n1. **l (left)**: Move the number at (5, 2) to (5, 1). The number at (5, 1) is 2, which is different from 32, so no combination occurs.\n2. **r (right)**: Move the number at (5, 1) to (5, 2). The number at (5, 2) is 32, which is the same as the moving number, so they combine to form 64.\n3. **r (right)**: Move the number at (5, 2) to (5, 3). The number at (5, 3) is 0, so no combination occurs.\n4. **u (up)**: Move the number at (5, 3) to (4, 3). The number at (4, 3) is 0, so no combination occurs.\n5. **r (right)**: Move the number at (4, 3) to (4, 4). The number at (4, 4) is 32, which is different from 64, so no combination occurs.\n\nLet's simulate these steps using Python code to update the matrix accordingly.\n\n```python\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [0, 0, 8, 32, 0],\n    [8, 0, 0, 32, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [4, 4, 0, 32, 4],\n    [2, 32, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Initial position of the number to move\nposition = (4, 1)  # (row, column) in 0-indexed\n\n# Sequence of moves\nmoves = 'lrrur'\n\n# Function to perform a move\ndef move(position, direction):\n    row, col = position\n    if direction == 'l':\n        col -= 1\n    elif direction == 'r':\n        col += 1\n    elif direction == 'u':\n        row -= 1\n    elif direction == 'd':\n        row += 1\n    return row, col\n\n# Simulate the moves\nfor move_direction in moves:\n    new_position = move(position, move_direction)\n    new_row, new_col = new_position\n    current_value = matrix[position[0]][position[1]]\n    target_value = matrix[new_row][new_col]\n    \n    # Check if we can combine\n    if current_value == target_value:\n        matrix[new_row][new_col] *= 2\n        matrix[position[0]][position[1]] = 0\n    else:\n        matrix[new_row][new_col] = current_value\n        matrix[position[0]][position[1]] = 0\n    \n    # Update the position\n    position = new_position\n\n# Print the final matrix\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the final matrix.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the final matrix is:\n\n```\n[[0, 0, 8, 32, 0],\n [8, 0, 0, 32, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [4, 4, 0, 64, 4],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\nThis result shows that the number 32 from position (5, 2) moved according to the sequence 'lrrur' and combined with another 32 to form 64 at position (4, 3). The rest of the matrix remains unchanged.\n\nThe code executed correctly, and the final matrix is as expected. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[[0, 0, 8, 32, 0], [8, 0, 0, 32, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 4, 0, 64, 4], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]>>>"
