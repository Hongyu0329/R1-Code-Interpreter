  "question": "In an 5x5 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (5, 3) using the sequence 'llruu':\n0, 0, 0, 16, 0\n0, 0, 0, 16, 0\n8, 0, 2, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n2, 0, 8, 32, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number located at position (5, 3) in the given 5x5 grid according to the sequence 'llruu'. The number at this position is 8. We will follow the movement instructions and apply the rules of the '2048' game to see how the grid changes.\n\nLet's break down the movement sequence:\n1. **Initial Position**: (5, 3) with the number 8.\n2. **Move 'l' (left)**: The number moves from (5, 3) to (5, 2).\n3. **Move 'l' (left)**: The number moves from (5, 2) to (5, 1).\n4. **Move 'r' (right)**: The number moves from (5, 1) to (5, 2).\n5. **Move 'u' (up)**: The number moves from (5, 2) to (4, 2).\n6. **Move 'u' (up)**: The number moves from (4, 2) to (3, 2).\n\nDuring these movements, we need to check if the number can combine with another number of the same power of 2.
