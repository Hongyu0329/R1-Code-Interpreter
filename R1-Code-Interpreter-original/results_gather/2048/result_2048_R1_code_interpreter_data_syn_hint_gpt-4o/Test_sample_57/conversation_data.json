    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (3, 2) according to the sequence 'dull'. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   ```\n   2, 2, 0, 0\n   0, 16, 0, 0\n   4, 8, 2, 0\n   0, 32, 0, 0\n   ```\n\n2. **Initial Position of the Number:**\n   - The number at position (3, 2) is 8.\n\n3. **Movement Sequence:**\n   - **d (down):** Move the number at (3, 2) to (4, 2). The number 8 moves to the position of 32, but since they are different, they do not combine.\n   - **u (up):** Move the number at (4, 2) back to (3, 2).
