  "question": "In an 3x3 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (2, 1) using the sequence 'duu':\n0, 0, 4\n0, 2, 0\n0, 0, 16\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (2, 1) according to the sequence 'duu'. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   ```\n   0, 0, 4\n   0, 2, 0\n   0, 0, 16\n   ```\n\n2. **Initial Position of the Number:**\n   - The number 2 is at position (2, 1).\n\n3. **Move Sequence:**\n   - 'd': Move down\n   - 'u': Move up\n   - 'u': Move up\n\n4. **Simulating the Moves:**\n\n   - **Move 'd' (down):** \n     - The number 2 moves from (2, 1) to (3, 1).\n     - The matrix becomes:\n       ```\n       0, 0, 4\n       0, 0, 0\n       0, 2, 16\n       ```\n\n   - **Move 'u' (up):**\n     - The number 2 moves from (3, 1) to (2, 1).\n     - The matrix becomes:\n       ```\n       0, 0, 4\n       0, 2, 0\n       0, 0, 16\n       ```\n\n   - **Move 'u' (up):**\n     - The number 2 moves from (2, 1) to (1, 1).\n     - The matrix becomes:\n       ```\n       0, 2, 4\n       0, 0, 0\n       0, 0, 16\n       ```\n\n5. **Final Matrix:**\n   - After executing the sequence 'duu', the final matrix is:\n     ```\n     0, 2, 4\n     0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 16\n     ```\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<matrix>>>"
