  "question": "In an 2x2 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (1, 2) using the sequence 'uu':\n8, 32\n0, 2\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (1, 2) according to the given sequence 'uu'. The initial matrix is:\n\n```\n8, 32\n0, 2\n```\n\nThe position (1, 2) corresponds to the number 2. The sequence 'uu' means we move the number up twice. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Position**: The number 2 is at position (1, 2).\n2. **First 'u' Move**: Move the number 2 from (1, 2) to (0, 2). The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   8, 32\n   0, 0\n   ```\n   The number 2 is now at position (0, 2).\n3. **Second 'u' Move**: Attempt to move the number 2 from (0, 2) upwards. However, since (0, 2) is already at the top row, the number cannot move further up. Therefore, the matrix remains unchanged.\n\nThe final matrix after applying the sequence 'uu' is:\n\n```\n8, 32\n0, 0\n```\n\nThus, the number 2 has moved to the top row, but since it cannot move further up, it stays in its position.\n\nThe final matrix is:\n\n<<<[[8, 32], [0, 0]]>>>"
