  "question": "In an 2x2 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (1, 1) using the sequence 'lr':\n4, 4\n8, 8\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (1, 1) according to the given sequence 'lr' (left, right). The initial matrix is:\n\n```\n4, 4\n8, 8\n```\n\nThe sequence 'lr' means:\n1. Move left: Since the number is already at the leftmost position, this move will not change the matrix.\n2. Move right: The number at position (1, 1) will move to position (1, 2). Since both positions (1, 1) and (1, 2) contain the number 4, they will combine to form 8.\n\nLet's simulate these steps:\n\n1. Initial matrix:\n   ```\n   4, 4\n   8, 8\n   ```\n\n2. After moving left ('l'):\n   - The matrix remains unchanged because the number is already at the leftmost position.\n   ```\n   4, 4\n   8, 8\n   ```\n\n3. After moving right ('r'):\n   - The number at position (1, 1) moves to position (1, 2) and combines with the number there.\n   - The new matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   0, 8\n   8, 8\n   ```\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in Python to verify the result.\n\n```python\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [4, 4],\n    [8, 8]\n]\n\n# Move left ('l') - no change as it's already at the leftmost position\n# Move right ('r')\nif matrix[0][0] == matrix[0][1]:\n    matrix[0][1] *= 2\n    matrix[0][0] = 0\n\n# Print the final matrix\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we will get the final matrix.",
    "The code execution result matches our expectations based on the reasoning process. The matrix after moving the number in position (1, 1) using the sequence 'lr' is:\n\n```\n0, 8\n8, 8\n```\n\nThis confirms that the number at position (1, 1) moved to position (1, 2) and combined with the number there to form 8, while the original position (1, 1) is now 0.\n\nTherefore, the final matrix after the moves is:\n\n<<<[[0, 8], [8, 8]]>>>"
