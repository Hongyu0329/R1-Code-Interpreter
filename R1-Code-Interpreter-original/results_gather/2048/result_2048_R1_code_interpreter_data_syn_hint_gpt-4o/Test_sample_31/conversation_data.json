  "question": "In an 3x3 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (1, 2) using the sequence 'rdl':\n0, 4, 0\n8, 0, 2\n8, 2, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (1, 2) according to the sequence 'rdl' (right, down, left) and apply the rules of the 2048 game.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   ```\n   0, 4, 0\n   8, 0, 2\n   8, 2, 0\n   ```\n\n2. **Initial Position of the Number to Move:**\n   - The number at position (1, 2) is 2.\n\n3. **Move Sequence:**\n   - **Right (r):** Move the number from (1, 2) to (1, 3).\n   - **Down (d):** Move the number from (1, 3) to (2, 3).\n   - **Left (l):** Move the number from (2, 3) to (2, 2).\n\n4. **Combining Numbers:**\n   - During the move sequence, we need to check if the number can combine with another number of the same value.\n   - After moving right, the number 2 at (1, 3) does not combine with anything.\n   - After moving down, the number 2 at (2, 3) does not combine with anything.\n   - After moving left, the number 2 at (2, 2) combines with the existing 2 at (2, 2) to form 4.\n\n5. **Final Matrix:**\n   - After applying the move sequence and combining rules, we need to update the matrix.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to get the final matrix.\n\n```python\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [0, 4, 0],\n    [8, 0, 2],\n    [8, 2, 0]\n]\n\n# Initial position of the number to move\nposition = (1, 2)\n\n# Move sequence\nmoves = 'rdl'\n\n# Function to perform the move\ndef move_number(matrix, position, moves):\n    x, y = position\n    for move in moves:\n        if move == 'r':  # Move right\n            if y < 2:\n                y += 1\n        elif move == 'd':  # Move down\n            if x < 2:\n                x += 1\n        elif move == 'l':  # Move left\n            if y > 0:\n                y -= 1\n        elif move == 'u':  # Move up\n            if x > 0:\n                x -= 1\n\n        # Check for combination\n        if matrix[x][y] == matrix[position[0]][position[1]]:\n            matrix[x][y] *= 2\n            matrix[position[0]][position[1]] = 0\n        else:\n            matrix[x][y] = matrix[position[0]][position[1]]\n            matrix[position[0]][position[1]] = 0\n\n        # Update position\n        position = (x, y)\n\n    return matrix\n\n# Perform the move\nfinal_matrix = move_number(matrix, position, moves)\n\n# Print the final matrix\nprint(final_matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the final matrix.",
