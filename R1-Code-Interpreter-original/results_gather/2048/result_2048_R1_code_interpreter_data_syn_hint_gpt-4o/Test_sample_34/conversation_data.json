  "question": "In an 3x3 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (3, 3) using the sequence 'lrl':\n32, 0, 0\n2, 4, 0\n32, 0, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (3, 3) according to the sequence 'lrl'. The initial matrix is:\n\n```\n32, 0, 0\n2, 4, 0\n32, 0, 0\n```\n\nThe number at position (3, 3) is 0. We will move this number according to the sequence 'lrl':\n\n1. **Move Left (l):** \n   - The number at (3, 3) moves to (3, 2). The matrix becomes:\n     ```\n     32, 0, 0\n     2, 4, 0\n     32, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n2. **Move Right (r):**\n   - The number at (3, 2) moves back to (3, 3). The matrix remains:\n     ```\n     32, 0, 0\n     2, 4, 0\n     32, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n3. **Move Left (l):**\n   - The number at (3, 3) moves to (3, 2). The matrix becomes:\n     ```\n     32, 0, 0\n     2, 4, 0\n     32, 0, 0\n     ```\n\nSince the number being moved is 0, it does not affect the other numbers in the grid. Therefore, the matrix remains unchanged after the sequence of moves.\n\nThe final matrix is:\n\n```\n32, 0, 0\n2, 4, 0\n32, 0, 0\n```\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<[[32, 0, 0], [2, 4, 0], [32, 0, 0]]>>>"
