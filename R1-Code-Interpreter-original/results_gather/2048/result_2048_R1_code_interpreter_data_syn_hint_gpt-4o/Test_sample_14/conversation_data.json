  "question": "In an 2x2 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (2, 2) using the sequence 'dl':\n0, 8\n2, 2\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (2, 2) according to the given sequence 'dl'. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   ```\n   0, 8\n   2, 2\n   ```\n\n2. **Move 'd' (down):**\n   - Since the grid is only 2x2, moving down from position (2, 2) doesn't change the position because it's already at the bottom row. Therefore, the matrix remains unchanged after this move.\n\n3. **Move 'l' (left):**\n   - Now, we move the number in position (2, 2) to the left. This means the number 2 at position (2, 2) will move to position (2, 1).\n   - After moving left, the matrix becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 8\n     2, 0\n     ```\n\n4. **Combining Numbers:**\n   - After the move, we check if any numbers can be combined. In this case, the numbers in the second row are 2 and 0, which cannot be combined because they are not the same power of 2.\n\nThus, the final matrix after performing the moves 'dl' is:\n```\n0, 8\n2, 0\n```\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<[[0, 8], [2, 0]]>>>"
