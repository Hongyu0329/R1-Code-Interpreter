  "question": "In an 2x2 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (1, 1) using the sequence 'du':\n8, 32\n8, 32\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (1, 1) according to the given sequence 'du'. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   ```\n   8, 32\n   8, 32\n   ```\n\n2. **Move 'd' (down):**\n   - The number at position (1, 1) is 8.\n   - Moving down, it will encounter the number at position (2, 1), which is also 8.\n   - Since they are the same, they combine to form 16 (the next power of 2).\n   - The matrix after this move:\n     ```\n     0, 32\n     16, 32\n     ```\n\n3. **Move 'u' (up):**\n   - The number at position (2, 1) is now 16.\n   - Moving up, it will encounter the number at position (1, 1), which is 0.\n   - Since they are different, the 16 moves to position (1, 1).\n   - The matrix after this move:\n     ```\n     16, 32\n     0, 32\n     ```\n\nNow, let's provide the final matrix after performing the sequence 'du'.\n\n<<<\n16, 32\n0, 32\n>>>"
