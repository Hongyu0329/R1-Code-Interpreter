When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32.

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (1, 1) according to the given sequence 'ud'. The initial matrix is:\n\n```\n2, 32\n16, 8\n```\n\nThe sequence 'ud' means we first move the number at position (1, 1) up, and then move it down. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Position (1, 1):** The number is 2.\n2. **Move Up ('u'):** \n   - The number 2 at position (1, 1) moves up to position (0, 1).\n   - The matrix becomes:\n     ```\n     2, 32\n     16, 8\n     ```\n   - Since there is no number at position (0, 1) to combine with, the number remains 2.\n3. **Move Down ('d'):**\n   - The number 2 at position (0, 1) moves down to position (1, 1).\n   - The matrix becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 32\n     2, 8\n     ```\n   - Again, there is no number at position (1, 1) to combine with, so the number remains 2.\n\nAfter executing the sequence 'ud', the final matrix is:\n\n```\n0, 32\n2, 8\n```\n\nThus, the matrix after moving is:\n\n<<<[[0, 32], [2, 8]]>>>"
