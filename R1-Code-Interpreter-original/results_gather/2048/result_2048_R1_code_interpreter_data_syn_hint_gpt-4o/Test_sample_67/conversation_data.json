  "question": "In an 5x5 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (4, 3) using the sequence 'uulll':\n8, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 8, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 32, 0, 16, 32\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (4, 3) according to the given sequence 'uulll'. The initial matrix is:\n\n```\n8, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 8, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 32, 0, 16, 32\n```\n\nThe number at position (4, 3) is 16. We will move this number according to the sequence:\n\n1. **First 'u' (up):** Move the number from (4, 3) to (3, 3).\n2. **Second 'u' (up):** Move the number from (3, 3) to (2, 3). At this point, it encounters another 8 at (2, 4), but since they are not the same, they do not combine.\n3. **First 'l' (left):** Move the number from (2, 3) to (2, 2).\n4. **Second 'l' (left):** Move the number from (2, 2) to (2, 1).\n5. **Third 'l' (left):** Move the number from (2, 1) to (2, 0).\n\nNow, let's simulate this process using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 8, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 32, 0, 16, 32]\n]\n\n# Initial position of the number to move\nx, y = 4, 3\n\n# Sequence of moves\nmoves = 'uulll'\n\n# Function to perform the move\ndef move_number(matrix, x, y, moves):\n    for move in moves:\n        if move == 'u':\n            if x > 0:\n                x -= 1\n        elif move == 'd':\n            if x < len(matrix) - 1:\n                x += 1\n        elif move == 'l':\n            if y > 0:\n                y -= 1\n        elif move == 'r':\n            if y < len(matrix[0]) - 1:\n                y += 1\n    return x, y\n\n# Perform the moves\nnew_x, new_y = move_number(matrix, x, y, moves)\n\n# Update the matrix\nmatrix[new_x][new_y] = matrix[4][3]\nmatrix[4][3] = 0\n\n# Print the updated matrix\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to see the final matrix.",
    "The code execution result shows that the number 16 has been moved to the correct position according to the sequence 'uulll'. The final matrix after moving the number is:\n\n```\n8, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n16, 0, 0, 8, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 32, 0, 0, 32\n```\n\nThis result matches the expected outcome based on the movement sequence provided. The number 16 has been moved from its initial position (4, 3) to the final position (2, 0) without any combination occurring, as it did not encounter another 16 during its movement.\n\nTherefore, the final matrix after executing the sequence 'uulll' is:\n\n<<<[[8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [16, 0, 0, 8, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 32, 0, 0, 32]]>>>"
