  "question": "In an 3x3 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (3, 2) using the sequence 'rll':\n0, 0, 4\n16, 4, 0\n0, 0, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (3, 2) according to the given sequence 'rll'. The initial matrix is:\n\n```\n0, 0, 4\n16, 4, 0\n0, 0, 0\n```\n\nThe number at position (3, 2) is 0. We will move this number according to the sequence 'rll':\n\n1. **Move Right (r):** \n   - The number at (3, 2) moves to (3, 3). Since both positions contain 0, the result remains 0.\n\n2. **Move Left (l):**\n   - The number at (3, 3) moves to (3, 2). Again, both positions contain 0, so the result remains 0.\n\n3. **Move Left (l):**\n   - The number at (3, 2) moves to (3, 1). Both positions contain 0, so the result remains 0.\n\nSince the number is 0, it doesn't change any other numbers in the grid during the moves. Therefore, the matrix remains unchanged after the sequence of moves.\n\nThe final matrix is:\n\n```\n0, 0, 4\n16, 4, 0\n0, 0, 0\n```\n\nThus, the matrix after moving is:\n\n<<<[[0, 0, 4], [16, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0]]>>>"
