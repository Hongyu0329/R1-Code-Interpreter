  "question": "In an 4x4 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (4, 1) using the sequence 'duuu':\n0, 4, 16, 0\n0, 0, 2, 0\n4, 0, 0, 0\n2, 0, 0, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (4, 1) according to the sequence 'duuu'. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   ```\n   0, 4, 16, 0\n   0, 0, 2, 0\n   4, 0, 0, 0\n   2, 0, 0, 0\n   ```\n\n2. **Initial Position of the Number:**\n   - The number at position (4, 1) is 2.\n\n3. **Move Sequence:**\n   - **d (down):** Since the number is already at the bottom row, moving down has no effect.\n   - **u (up):** Move the number up from (4, 1) to (3, 1).\n   - **u (up):** Move the number up from (3, 1) to (2, 1).\n   - **u (up):** Move the number up from (2, 1) to (1, 1).\n\n4. **Combining Numbers:**\n   - When the number moves to (3, 1), it encounters another 4. Since 2 and 4 are not the same, they do not combine.\n   - When the number moves to (2, 1), it encounters 0, so it simply moves there.\n   - When the number moves to (1, 1), it encounters 0, so it simply moves there.\n\n5. **Final Matrix:**\n   - After executing the move sequence, the matrix becomes:\n     ```\n     2, 4, 16, 0\n     0, 0, 2, 0\n     4, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in a Python script to verify the final matrix.\n\n```python\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [0, 4, 16, 0],\n    [0, 0, 2, 0],\n    [4, 0, 0, 0],\n    [2, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Initial position of the number\nposition = (3, 0)  # (row, column) in 0-indexed\n\n# Move sequence\nmoves = 'duuu'\n\n# Function to move the number\ndef move_number(matrix, position, moves):\n    for move in moves:\n        row, col = position\n        if move == 'd' and row < 3:\n            # Move down\n            if matrix[row + 1][col] == 0:\n                matrix[row + 1][col] = matrix[row][col]\n                matrix[row][col] = 0\n                position = (row + 1, col)\n        elif move == 'u' and row > 0:\n            # Move up\n            if matrix[row - 1][col] == 0:\n                matrix[row - 1][col] = matrix[row][col]\n                matrix[row][col] = 0\n                position = (row - 1, col)\n        elif move == 'l' and col > 0:\n            # Move left\n            if matrix[row][col - 1] == 0:\n                matrix[row][col - 1] = matrix[row][col]\n                matrix[row][col] = 0\n                position = (row, col - 1)\n        elif move == 'r' and col < 3:\n            # Move right\n            if matrix[row][col + 1] == 0:\n                matrix[row][col + 1] = matrix[row][col]\n                matrix[row][col] = 0\n                position = (row, col + 1)\n    return matrix\n\n# Apply the moves\nfinal_matrix = move_number(matrix, position, moves)\n\n# Print the final matrix\nprint(final_matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the final matrix.",
