  "question": "In an 5x5 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (4, 3) using the sequence 'ddddd':\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 16\n32, 8, 0, 0, 0\n4, 0, 0, 16, 0\n8, 0, 0, 0, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (4, 3) according to the sequence 'ddddd'. The initial matrix is:\n\n```\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 16\n32, 8, 0, 0, 0\n4, 0, 0, 16, 0\n8, 0, 0, 0, 0\n```\n\nThe number at position (4, 3) is 0. We will move this number downwards five times. Since the number is 0, it will not change the matrix as it moves. However, we need to ensure that the movement is within the bounds of the matrix.\n\nLet's simulate the movement:\n\n1. Start at position (4, 3) with the number 0.\n2. Move down to (5, 3). The number remains 0.\n3. Attempt to move down to (6, 3), but this is out of bounds, so the number stays at (5, 3).\n\nSince the number is 0, it does not affect any other numbers in the matrix. Therefore, the matrix remains unchanged.\n\nThe final matrix is:\n\n```\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 16\n32, 8, 0, 0, 0\n4, 0, 0, 16, 0\n8, 0, 0, 0, 0\n```\n\nThus, the matrix after the movement is:\n\n<<<\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 16\n32, 8, 0, 0, 0\n4, 0, 0, 16, 0\n8, 0, 0, 0, 0\n>>>"
