  "question": "In an 2x2 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (2, 1) using the sequence 'rr':\n8, 8\n8, 32\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (2, 1) according to the given sequence 'rr'. The initial matrix is:\n\n```\n8, 8\n8, 32\n```\n\nThe sequence 'rr' indicates that we need to move the number in position (2, 1) to the right twice. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Position**: The number at position (2, 1) is 8.\n2. **First Move (r)**: Move the number at (2, 1) to the right to position (2, 2). The matrix becomes:\n   ```\n   8, 8\n   0, 40\n   ```\n   Here, the 8 from (2, 1) combines with the 32 at (2, 2) to form 40.\n3. **Second Move (r)**: Since the number is already at the rightmost position, it cannot move further. The matrix remains:\n   ```\n   8, 8\n   0, 40\n   ```\n\nNow, let's generate the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<\n8, 8\n0, 40\n>>>"
