  "question": "In an 4x4 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (4, 2) using the sequence 'uddd':\n0, 0, 0, 32\n0, 8, 0, 0\n0, 0, 16, 4\n32, 32, 4, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (4, 2) according to the sequence 'uddd'. The initial matrix is:\n\n```\n0, 0, 0, 32\n0, 8, 0, 0\n0, 0, 16, 4\n32, 32, 4, 0\n```\n\nThe number at position (4, 2) is 32. We will move this number according to the sequence 'uddd':\n\n1. **Move Up (u):** The number 32 at (4, 2) moves to (3, 2). Since (3, 2) is 0, the number 32 simply moves there without any combination.\n\n2. **Move Down (d):** The number 32 at (3, 2) moves to (4, 2). Since (4, 2) is 0, the number 32 simply moves there without any combination.\n\n3. **Move Down (d):** The number 32 at (4, 2) moves to (4, 2) again.

In 0-indexed format, this is (3, 1).\n\n2. **Move Up (u):** \n   - Move 32 from (3, 1) to (2, 1).\n   - Since (2, 1) is 0, the number 32 moves there without any combination.\n\n3. **Move Down (d):**\n   - Move 32 from (2, 1) to (3, 1).\n   - Since (3, 1) is 0, the number 32 moves there without any combination.\n\n4. **Move Down (d):**\n   - Move 32 from (3, 1) to (4, 1).\n   - Since (4, 1) is 32, the numbers combine to form 64.\n\n5. **Move Down (d):**\n   - The number 64 at (4, 1) cannot move further down as it is already at the bottom row.\n\n### Final Matrix\n\nAfter applying the moves, the final matrix should be:\n\n```\n0, 0, 0, 32\n0, 8, 0, 0\n0, 0, 16, 4\n64, 0, 4, 0\n```\n\nThe number 32 at (4, 2) moved up, then down twice, combining with the 32 at (4, 1) to form 64.\n\n<<<[[0, 0, 0, 32], [0, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 16, 4], [64, 0, 4, 0]]>>>"
