  "question": "In an 3x3 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (3, 2) using the sequence 'uur':\n0, 0, 0\n0, 8, 0\n32, 32, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (3, 2) according to the sequence 'uur'. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   ```\n   0, 0, 0\n   0, 8, 0\n   32, 32, 0\n   ```\n\n2. **Initial Position of the Number to Move:**\n   - The number at position (3, 2) is 32.\n\n3. **Move Sequence:**\n   - 'u' (up): Move the number from (3, 2) to (2, 2).\n   - 'u' (up): Move the number from (2, 2) to (1, 2).\n   - 'r' (right): Move the number from (1, 2) to (1, 3).\n\n4. **Combining Numbers:**\n   - After the first 'u', the number 32 at (3, 2) moves to (2, 2) and combines with 8, but since they are not the same, they don't combine.\n   - After the second 'u', the number 32 at (2, 2) moves to (1, 2), and since there is no number there, it stays as 32.\n   - After the 'r', the number 32 at (1, 2) moves to (1, 3), and since there is no number there, it stays as 32.\n\n5. **Final Matrix:**\n   - The number 32 has moved to position (1, 3).\n\nLet's simulate this process using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 8, 0],\n    [32, 32, 0]\n]\n\n# Initial position of the number to move\nposition = (2, 1)  # (3, 2) in 0-indexed\n\n# Move sequence\nmoves = 'uur'\n\n# Function to move the number\ndef move_number(matrix, position, moves):\n    for move in moves:\n        x, y = position\n        if move == 'u':\n            new_position = (x - 1, y)\n        elif move == 'd':\n            new_position = (x + 1, y)\n        elif move == 'l':\n            new_position = (x, y - 1)\n        elif move == 'r':\n            new_position = (x, y + 1)\n        \n        # Check if the new position is within bounds\n        if 0 <= new_position[0] < 3 and 0 <= new_position[1] < 3:\n            # Move the number\n            if matrix[new_position[0]][new_position[1]] == matrix[x][y]:\n                # Combine numbers\n                matrix[new_position[0]][new_position[1]] *= 2\n                matrix[x][y] = 0\n            elif matrix[new_position[0]][new_position[1]] == 0:\n                # Move to empty space\n                matrix[new_position[0]][new_position[1]] = matrix[x][y]\n                matrix[x][y] = 0\n            position = new_position\n    \n    return matrix\n\n# Apply the moves\nfinal_matrix = move_number(matrix, position, moves)\n\n# Print the final matrix\nprint(final_matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the final matrix.",
