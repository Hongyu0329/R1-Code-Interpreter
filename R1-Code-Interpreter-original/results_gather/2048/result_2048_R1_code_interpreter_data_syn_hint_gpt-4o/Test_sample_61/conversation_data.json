  "question": "In an 5x5 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (1, 2) using the sequence 'urdrl':\n0, 0, 0, 0, 8\n0, 32, 4, 8, 0\n4, 0, 0, 0, 0\n32, 0, 0, 0, 8\n0, 0, 0, 2, 32\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (1, 2) according to the sequence 'urdrl'. The initial matrix is:\n\n```\n0, 0, 0, 0, 8\n0, 32, 4, 8, 0\n4, 0, 0, 0, 0\n32, 0, 0, 0, 8\n0, 0, 0, 2, 32\n```\n\nThe number at position (1, 2) is 4. We will move this number according to the sequence and apply the rules of the 2048 game.\n\n1. **Move 'u' (up):** The number 4 at (1, 2) moves to (0, 2). Since (0, 2) is 0, it simply moves there.\n2. **Move 'r' (right):** The number 4 at (0, 2) moves to (0, 3). Since (0, 3) is 0, it simply moves there.\n3. **Move 'd' (down):** The number 4 at (0, 3) moves to (1, 3). Since (1, 3) is 8, it cannot combine, so it stays as 4.\n4. **Move 'r' (right):** The number 4 at (1, 3) moves to (1, 4). Since (1, 4) is 0, it simply moves there.\n5. **Move 'l' (left):** The number 4 at (1, 4) moves to (1, 3).
