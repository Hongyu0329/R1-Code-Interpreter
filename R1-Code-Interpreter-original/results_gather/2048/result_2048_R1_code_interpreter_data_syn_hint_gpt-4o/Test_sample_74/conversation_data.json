  "question": "In an 5x5 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (1, 5) using the sequence 'rrurl':\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 2, 0, 32\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 16, 0, 0\n16, 2, 0, 0, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (1, 5) according to the given sequence 'rrurl'. The initial matrix is:\n\n```\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 2, 0, 32\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 16, 0, 0\n16, 2, 0, 0, 0\n```\n\nThe number at position (1, 5) is 32. We will move this number according to the sequence and check for any possible combinations with other numbers.\n\n1. **Initial Position**: (1, 5) with value 32\n2. **Move 'r'**: Move right to (1, 5) (no change, as it's already at the rightmost position)\n3. **Move 'r'**: Move right to (1, 5) (no change, as it's already at the rightmost position)\n4. **Move 'u'**: Move up to (0, 5) (no combination possible)\n5. **Move 'r'**: Move right to (0, 5) (no change, as it's already at the rightmost position)\n6. **Move 'l'**: Move left to (0, 4) (no combination possible)\n\nNow, let's implement this logic in a Python script to simulate the movement and update the matrix accordingly.\n\n```python\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 2, 0, 32],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 16, 0, 0],\n    [16, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Initial position of the number to move\nposition = (1, 4)  # (row, column) in 0-indexed\nvalue = matrix[position[0]][position[1]]\n\n# Sequence of moves\nmoves = 'rrurl'\n\n# Function to move the number in the matrix\ndef move_number(matrix, position, value, moves):\n    for move in moves:\n        if move == 'r':\n            # Move right\n            if position[1] < 4:\n                if matrix[position[0]][position[1] + 1] == value:\n                    # Combine numbers\n                    matrix[position[0]][position[1] + 1] *= 2\n                    value = matrix[position[0]][position[1] + 1]\n                    matrix[position[0]][position[1]] = 0\n                elif matrix[position[0]][position[1] + 1] == 0:\n                    # Move to empty space\n                    matrix[position[0]][position[1] + 1] = value\n                    matrix[position[0]][position[1]] = 0\n                position = (position[0], position[1] + 1)\n        elif move == 'l':\n            # Move left\n            if position[1] > 0:\n                if matrix[position[0]][position[1] - 1] == value:\n                    # Combine numbers\n                    matrix[position[0]][position[1] - 1] *= 2\n                    value = matrix[position[0]][position[1] - 1]\n                    matrix[position[0]][position[1]] = 0\n                elif matrix[position[0]][position[1] - 1] == 0:\n                    # Move to empty space\n                    matrix[position[0]][position[1] - 1] = value\n                    matrix[position[0]][position[1]] = 0\n                position = (position[0], position[1] - 1)\n        elif move == 'u':\n            # Move up\n            if position[0] > 0:\n                if matrix[position[0] - 1][position[1]] == value:\n                    # Combine numbers\n                    matrix[position[0] - 1][position[1]] *= 2\n                    value = matrix[position[0] - 1][position[1]]\n                    matrix[position[0]][position[1]] = 0\n                elif matrix[position[0] - 1][position[1]] == 0:\n                    # Move to empty space\n                    matrix[position[0] - 1][position[1]] = value\n                    matrix[position[0]][position[1]] = 0\n                position = (position[0] - 1, position[1])\n        elif move == 'd':\n            # Move down\n            if position[0] < 4:\n                if matrix[position[0] + 1][position[1]] == value:\n                    # Combine numbers\n                    matrix[position[0] + 1][position[1]] *= 2\n                    value = matrix[position[0] + 1][position[1]]\n                    matrix[position[0]][position[1]] = 0\n                elif matrix[position[0] + 1][position[1]] == 0:\n                    # Move to empty space\n                    matrix[position[0] + 1][position[1]] = value\n                    matrix[position[0]][position[1]] = 0\n                position = (position[0] + 1, position[1])\n    return matrix\n\n# Move the number according to the sequence\nresult_matrix = move_number(matrix, position, value, moves)\n\n# Print the resulting matrix\nprint(result_matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final state of the matrix.",
    "The code execution result shows the final matrix after moving the number according to the sequence 'rrurl'. The number 32, initially at position (1, 5), moved to position (0, 4) after the sequence of moves. The matrix after the moves is:\n\n```\n0, 0, 0, 32, 0\n0, 0, 2, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 16, 0, 0\n16, 2, 0, 0, 0\n```\n\nThis result is consistent with the expected behavior of the '2048' game rules, where the number moves according to the specified directions and combines with identical numbers if possible. In this case, no combinations occurred, and the number simply moved to an empty space.\n\nThe final matrix is:\n\n<<<[[0, 0, 0, 32, 0], [0, 0, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 16, 0, 0], [16, 2, 0, 0, 0]]>>>"
