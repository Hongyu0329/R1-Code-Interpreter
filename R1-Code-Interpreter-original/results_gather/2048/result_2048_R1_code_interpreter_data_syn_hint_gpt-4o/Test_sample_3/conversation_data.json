  "question": "In an 2x2 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (2, 2) using the sequence 'ur':\n32, 2\n32, 4\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (2, 2) according to the given sequence 'ur'. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   ```\n   32, 2\n   32, 4\n   ```\n   The number at position (2, 2) is 4.\n\n2. **Move 'u' (up):**\n   - The number 4 at position (2, 2) moves up to position (1, 2).\n   - The matrix becomes:\n     ```\n     32, 4\n     32, 2\n     ```\n\n3. **Move 'r' (right):**\n   - The number 4 at position (1, 2) attempts to move right, but since it is already at the rightmost column, it cannot move further right.\n   - Therefore, the matrix remains unchanged:\n     ```\n     32, 4\n     32, 2\n     ```\n\nNow, let's verify this process using a Python script to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [32, 2],\n    [32, 4]\n]\n\n# Move 'u' (up)\nmatrix[0][1], matrix[1][1] = matrix[1][1], matrix[0][1]\n\n# Move 'r' (right) - no change since it's already at the rightmost column\n\n# Print the final matrix\nprint(matrix)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, we can confirm the final state of the matrix. \n\nThe final matrix after the moves is:\n```\n32, 4\n32, 2\n```\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<[[32, 4], [32, 2]]>>>",
    "The code execution result confirms that the matrix after the moves is `[[32, 4], [32, 2]]`. The code correctly simulates the movement of the number in position (2, 2) according to the sequence 'ur'. \n\nThe task was relatively straightforward, involving simple matrix manipulation without the need for complex symbolic computing or efficient searching algorithms. The code effectively handled the movement and correctly maintained the matrix's state.\n\nGiven the simplicity of the task and the correctness of the result, there is no need for further code generation or complex symbolic computing in this case. The final answer is:\n\n<<<[[32, 4], [32, 2]]>>>"
