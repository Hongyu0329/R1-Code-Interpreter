  "question": "In an 2x2 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (2, 2) using the sequence 'lr':\n8, 4\n16, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (2, 2) according to the given sequence 'lr' (left, then right) in the 2x2 grid. The initial grid is:\n\n```\n8, 4\n16, 0\n```\n\nThe number at position (2, 2) is 0. Let's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Grid:**\n   ```\n   8, 4\n   16, 0\n   ```\n\n2. **Move Left ('l'):**\n   - The number 0 at position (2, 2) moves to position (2, 1).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     8, 4\n     0, 16\n     ```\n\n3. **Move Right ('r'):**\n   - The number 0 at position (2, 1) moves back to position (2, 2).\n   - The grid returns to:\n     ```\n     8, 4\n     16, 0\n     ```\n\nSince the number 0 does not combine with any other number, the grid remains unchanged after the sequence 'lr'.\n\nTherefore, the final matrix after performing the moves is:\n\n```\n8, 4\n16, 0\n```\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<[[8, 4], [16, 0]]>>>"
