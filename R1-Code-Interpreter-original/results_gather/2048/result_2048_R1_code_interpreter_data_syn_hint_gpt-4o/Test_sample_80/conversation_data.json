  "question": "In an 5x5 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (1, 5) using the sequence 'luuddd':\n0, 0, 0, 0, 16\n4, 32, 0, 32, 4\n2, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 2, 8\n0, 0, 0, 8, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (1, 5) according to the sequence 'luuddd'. The initial matrix is:\n\n```\n0, 0, 0, 0, 16\n4, 32, 0, 32, 4\n2, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 2, 8\n0, 0, 0, 8, 0\n```\n\nThe number at position (1, 5) is 16. We will move this number according to the sequence and apply the rules of the 2048 game.\n\n1. **Move 'l' (left):** The number 16 moves from (1, 5) to (1, 4). Since (1, 4) is 0, it simply moves there.\n2. **Move 'u' (up):** The number 16 moves from (1, 4) to (0, 4). Since (0, 4) is 0, it simply moves there.\n3. **Move 'u' (up):** The number 16 moves from (0, 4) to (-1, 4), which is out of bounds. So, it stays at (0, 4).\n4. **Move 'd' (down):** The number 16 moves from (0, 4) to (1, 4). Since (1, 4) is 4, it cannot combine, so it stays at (1, 4).\n5. **Move 'd' (down):** The number 16 moves from (1, 4) to (2, 4). Since (2, 4) is 0, it simply moves there.\n6. **Move 'd' (down):** The number 16 moves from (2, 4) to (3, 4). Since (3, 4) is 8, it cannot combine, so it stays at (3, 4).\n\nNow, let's simulate this process using Python code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 16],\n    [4, 32, 0, 32, 4],\n    [2, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 2, 8],\n    [0, 0, 0, 8, 0]\n]\n\n# Initial position of the number 16\nposition = (0, 4)\n\n# Sequence of moves\nmoves = 'luuddd'\n\n# Function to move the number in the matrix\ndef move_number(matrix, position, moves):\n    x, y = position\n    for move in moves:\n        if move == 'l':\n            if y > 0 and matrix[x][y-1] == 0:\n                matrix[x][y-1] = matrix[x][y]\n                matrix[x][y] = 0\n                y -= 1\n        elif move == 'u':\n            if x > 0 and matrix[x-1][y] == 0:\n                matrix[x-1][y] = matrix[x][y]\n                matrix[x][y] = 0\n                x -= 1\n        elif move == 'd':\n            if x < 4 and matrix[x+1][y] == 0:\n                matrix[x+1][y] = matrix[x][y]\n                matrix[x][y] = 0\n                x += 1\n        elif move == 'r':\n            if y < 4 and matrix[x][y+1] == 0:\n                matrix[x][y+1] = matrix[x][y]\n                matrix[x][y] = 0\n                y += 1\n    return matrix\n\n# Apply the moves\nresult_matrix = move_number(matrix, position, moves)\n\n# Print the resulting matrix\nprint(result_matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the final matrix.",
