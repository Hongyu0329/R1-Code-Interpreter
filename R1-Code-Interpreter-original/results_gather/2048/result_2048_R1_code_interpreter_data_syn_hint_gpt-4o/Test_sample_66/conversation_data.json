  "question": "In an 5x5 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (4, 2) using the sequence 'llrul':\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n16, 0, 8, 32, 0\n0, 8, 32, 0, 0\n16, 8, 0, 0, 0\n0, 32, 0, 2, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number located at position (4, 2) in the given 5x5 grid according to the sequence 'llrul'. The number at this position is 32. We will follow the sequence of moves and apply the rules of the 2048 game to determine the final state of the grid.\n\nLet's break down the sequence of moves:\n1. **l (left)**: Move the number at (4, 2) to (4, 1).\n2. **l (left)**: Move the number at (4, 1) to (4, 0).\n3. **r (right)**: Move the number at (4, 0) to (4, 1).\n4. **u (up)**: Move the number at (4, 1) to (3, 1).\n5. **l (left)**: Move the number at (3, 1) to (3, 0).\n\nDuring each move, we need to check if the number can combine with another number of the same value. If it can, they will merge into a single number of the next power of 2.\n\nLet's simulate this process using Python code:\n\n```python\n# Initial grid\ngrid = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [16, 0, 8, 32, 0],\n    [0, 8, 32, 0, 0],\n    [16, 8, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 32, 0, 2, 0]\n]\n\n# Initial position of the number to move\nx, y = 4, 2\n\n# Sequence of moves\nmoves = 'llrul'\n\n# Function to perform a move\ndef move(grid, x, y, direction):\n    if direction == 'l' and y > 0:\n        if grid[x][y-1] == grid[x][y]:\n            grid[x][y-1] *= 2\n            grid[x][y] = 0\n        elif grid[x][y-1] == 0:\n            grid[x][y-1] = grid[x][y]\n            grid[x][y] = 0\n        y -= 1\n    elif direction == 'r' and y < 4:\n        if grid[x][y+1] == grid[x][y]:\n            grid[x][y+1] *= 2\n            grid[x][y] = 0\n        elif grid[x][y+1] == 0:\n            grid[x][y+1] = grid[x][y]\n            grid[x][y] = 0\n        y += 1\n    elif direction == 'u' and x > 0:\n        if grid[x-1][y] == grid[x][y]:\n            grid[x-1][y] *= 2\n            grid[x][y] = 0\n        elif grid[x-1][y] == 0:\n            grid[x-1][y] = grid[x][y]\n            grid[x][y] = 0\n        x -= 1\n    elif direction == 'd' and x < 4:\n        if grid[x+1][y] == grid[x][y]:\n            grid[x+1][y] *= 2\n            grid[x][y] = 0\n        elif grid[x+1][y] == 0:\n            grid[x+1][y] = grid[x][y]\n            grid[x][y] = 0\n        x += 1\n    return x, y\n\n# Apply the sequence of moves\nfor move_direction in moves:\n    x, y = move(grid, x, y, move_direction)\n\n# Print the final grid\nprint(grid)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the final state of the matrix.",
