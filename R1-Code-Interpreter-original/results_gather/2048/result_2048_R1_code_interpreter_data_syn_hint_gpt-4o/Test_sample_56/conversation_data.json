    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (2, 1) according to the sequence 'dlul'. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   ```\n   0, 32, 8, 0\n   0, 0, 0, 0\n   8, 0, 0, 32\n   16, 0, 0, 0\n   ```\n\n2. **Initial Position of the Number:**\n   - The number at position (2, 1) is 8.\n\n3. **Movement Sequence:**\n   - **d (down):** Move the number from (2, 1) to (3, 1).

The number at (2, 0) is 0, so the number 8 moves to this position.\n   - **l (left):** Move the number from (2, 0) to (2, 0) (no change since it's already at the leftmost position).\n\n4. **Final Matrix:**\n   - After performing the moves, the matrix should be updated accordingly.\n\nLet's implement this in code to ensure accuracy.\n\n```python\n# Initial matrix\nmatrix = [\n    [0, 32, 8, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [8, 0, 0, 32],\n    [16, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\n# Initial position of the number\nposition = (2, 1)\n\n# Movement sequence\nmoves = 'dlul'\n\n# Function to perform the move\ndef move_number(matrix, position, moves):\n    x, y = position\n    for move in moves:\n        if move == 'd':  # Move down\n            if x < 3 and matrix[x+1][y] == 0:\n                matrix[x+1][y] = matrix[x][y]\n                matrix[x][y] = 0\n                x += 1\n        elif move == 'l':  # Move left\n            if y > 0 and matrix[x][y-1] == 0:\n                matrix[x][y-1] = matrix[x][y]\n                matrix[x][y] = 0\n                y -= 1\n        elif move == 'u':  # Move up\n            if x > 0 and matrix[x-1][y] == 0:\n                matrix[x-1][y] = matrix[x][y]\n                matrix[x][y] = 0\n                x -= 1\n        elif move == 'r':  # Move right\n            if y < 3 and matrix[x][y+1] == 0:\n                matrix[x][y+1] = matrix[x][y]\n                matrix[x][y] = 0\n                y += 1\n    return matrix\n\n# Perform the moves\nfinal_matrix = move_number(matrix, position, moves)\n\n# Print the final matrix\nprint(final_matrix)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the final matrix.",

    "The previous attempts to solve the problem using code did not yield the correct results.
