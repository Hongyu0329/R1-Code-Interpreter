  "question": "In an 2x2 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (2, 1) using the sequence 'lr':\n4, 16\n32, 8\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to simulate the movement of the number in position (2, 1) according to the given sequence 'lr'. The initial matrix is:\n\n```\n4, 16\n32, 8\n```\n\nThe number at position (2, 1) is 32. We will follow the sequence of moves:\n\n1. **Move Left ('l')**: \n   - The number 32 at position (2, 1) moves to position (2, 0). \n   - Since there is no position (2, 0) in a 2x2 grid, the number remains at (2, 1).\n\n2. **Move Right ('r')**: \n   - The number 32 at position (2, 1) moves to position (2, 2).\n   - Since there is no position (2, 2) in a 2x2 grid, the number remains at (2, 1).\n\nSince the grid is only 2x2, the number cannot move outside the grid, and it remains in its original position after both moves. Therefore, the matrix remains unchanged.\n\nThe final matrix is:\n\n```\n4, 16\n32, 8\n```\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<[[4, 16], [32, 8]]>>>"
