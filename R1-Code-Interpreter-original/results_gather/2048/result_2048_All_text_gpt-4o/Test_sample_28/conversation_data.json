  "question": "In an 3x3 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (1, 1) using the sequence 'lrl':\n0, 0, 8\n32, 32, 32\n0, 0, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'lrl' for the number in position (1, 1) of the given 3x3 grid. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   ```\n   0, 0, 8\n   32, 32, 32\n   0, 0, 0\n   ```\n\n2. **Identify the Starting Position:**\n   - The number at position (1, 1) is 32.\n\n3. **First Move ('l'):**\n   - Move left: Since the number is already at the leftmost position in its row, moving left does not change its position.\n   - Matrix remains unchanged:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 8\n     32, 32, 32\n     0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n4. **Second Move ('r'):**\n   - Move right: The number 32 at position (1, 1) moves to position (1, 2).\n   - Check for combination: The number 32 at (1, 2) meets another 32 at (1, 2), so they combine to form 64.\n   - The matrix after this move:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 8\n     0, 64, 32\n     0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n5. **Third Move ('l'):**\n   - Move left: The number 64 at position (1, 2) moves to position (1, 1).\n   - Check for combination: There is no number to combine with at (1, 1), so it remains 64.\n   - The matrix after this move:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 8\n     64, 0, 32\n     0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\nAfter following the sequence 'lrl', the final matrix is:\n\n<<<0, 0, 8; 64, 0, 32; 0, 0, 0>>>"
