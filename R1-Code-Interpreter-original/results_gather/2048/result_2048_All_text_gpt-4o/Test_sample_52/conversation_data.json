  "question": "In an 4x4 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (2, 1) using the sequence 'dddl':\n0, 2, 0, 0\n0, 0, 32, 2\n0, 0, 4, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'dddl' for the number located at position (2, 1) in the given 4x4 grid. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   ```\n   0, 2, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 32, 2\n   0, 0, 4, 0\n   0, 0, 0, 0\n   ```\n\n2. **Identify the Starting Position:**\n   - The number at position (2, 1) is 0. However, since 0 is not a power of 2, it doesn't affect the game. We should focus on the number 2 at position (1, 2) because it is the only number that can move according to the sequence.\n\n3. **Move Sequence: 'dddl'**\n   - **First Move (d):** Move down.\n     - The number 2 at position (1, 2) moves to position (2, 2).\n   - **Second Move (d):** Move down.\n     - The number 2 at position (2, 2) moves to position (3, 2).\n   - **Third Move (d):** Move down.\n     - The number 2 at position (3, 2) moves to position (4, 2).\n   - **Fourth Move (l):** Move left.\n     - The number 2 at position (4, 2) moves to position (4, 1).\n\n4. **Final Matrix:**\n   - After applying the sequence 'dddl', the matrix becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 32, 2\n     0, 0, 4, 0\n     0, 2, 0, 0\n     ```\n\nTherefore, the final matrix after moving is:\n\n<<<0, 0, 0, 0; 0, 0, 32, 2; 0, 0, 4, 0; 0, 2, 0, 0>>>"
