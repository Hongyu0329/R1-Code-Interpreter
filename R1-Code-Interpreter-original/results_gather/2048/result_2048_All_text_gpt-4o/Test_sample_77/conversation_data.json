    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves for the number located at position (5, 2) in the given 5x5 grid. The sequence of moves is 'lrrul'. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Position**: The number at position (5, 2) is 16. The initial grid is:\n   ```\n   0, 0, 0, 8, 0\n   0, 4, 0, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 2, 0, 8\n   0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n   0, 16, 0, 0, 0\n   ```\n\n2. **Move 'l' (left)**: Move the number 16 from (5, 2) to (5, 1).\n   ```\n   0, 0, 0, 8, 0\n   0, 4, 0, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 2, 0, 8\n   0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n   16, 0, 0, 0, 0\n   ```\n\n3. **Move 'r' (right)**: Move the number 16 from (5, 1) to (5, 2).\n   ```\n   0, 0, 0, 8, 0\n   0, 4, 0, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 2, 0, 8\n   0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n   0, 16, 0, 0, 0\n   ```\n\n4. **Move 'r' (right)**: Move the number 16 from (5, 2) to (5, 3).\n   ```\n   0, 0, 0, 8, 0\n   0, 4, 0, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 2, 0, 8\n   0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 16, 0, 0\n   ```\n\n5. **Move 'u' (up)**: Move the number 16 from (5, 3) to (4, 3).\n   ```\n   0, 0, 0, 8, 0\n   0, 4, 0, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 2, 0, 8\n   0, 0, 16, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n   ```\n\n6. **Move 'l' (left)**: Move the number 16 from (4, 3) to (4, 2).\n   ```\n   0, 0, 0, 8, 0\n   0, 4, 0, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 2, 0, 8\n   0, 16, 0, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n   ```\n\nAfter following the sequence 'lrrul', the final matrix is:\n```\n<<<\n0, 0, 0, 8, 0\n0, 4, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 2, 0, 8\n0, 16, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n>>>\n```"
