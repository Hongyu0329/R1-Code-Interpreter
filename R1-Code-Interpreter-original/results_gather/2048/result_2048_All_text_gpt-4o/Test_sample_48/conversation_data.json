  "question": "In an 4x4 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (2, 2) using the sequence 'ludl':\n0, 32, 2, 2\n0, 0, 0, 0\n32, 0, 0, 0\n4, 4, 0, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'ludl' for the number located at position (2, 2) in the given 4x4 grid. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Grid:**\n   ```\n   0, 32, 2, 2\n   0, 0, 0, 0\n   32, 0, 0, 0\n   4, 4, 0, 0\n   ```\n\n2. **Identify the Starting Position:**\n   - The number at position (2, 2) is 0.\n\n3. **Move Sequence: 'ludl'**\n\n   - **Move 'l' (left):**\n     - The number at (2, 2) moves left to (2, 1).\n     - Since both positions (2, 1) and (2, 2) are 0, the grid remains unchanged.\n\n   - **Move 'u' (up):**\n     - The number at (2, 1) moves up to (1, 1).\n     - Again, since both positions (2, 1) and (1, 1) are 0, the grid remains unchanged.\n\n   - **Move 'd' (down):**\n     - The number at (1, 1) moves down to (2, 1).\n     - Since both positions (1, 1) and (2, 1) are 0, the grid remains unchanged.\n\n   - **Move 'l' (left):**\n     - The number at (2, 1) moves left to (2, 1) (no change since it's already at the leftmost position).\n     - Since both positions (2, 1) and (2, 1) are 0, the grid remains unchanged.\n\n4. **Final Grid:**\n   - After executing the sequence 'ludl', the grid remains unchanged because the number at (2, 2) was 0, and moving 0 around does not affect the grid.\n\nTherefore, the final matrix is:\n```\n<<<\n0, 32, 2, 2\n0, 0, 0, 0\n32, 0, 0, 0\n4, 4, 0, 0\n>>>\n```"
