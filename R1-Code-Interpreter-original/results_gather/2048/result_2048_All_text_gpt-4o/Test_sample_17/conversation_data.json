  "question": "In an 2x2 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (1, 1) using the sequence 'rr':\n4, 0\n0, 16\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the movement of the number in the grid according to the given sequence 'rr', which means moving right twice.\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   ```\n   4, 0\n   0, 16\n   ```\n\n2. **Position of the Number to Move:**\n   - The number at position (1, 1) is 4.\n\n3. **First Move ('r'):**\n   - Move the number 4 from position (1, 1) to the right to position (1, 2).\n   - The matrix after the first move:\n     ```\n     0, 4\n     0, 16\n     ```\n\n4. **Second Move ('r'):**\n   - Attempt to move the number 4 from position (1, 2) to the right.\n   - Since there is no column to the right of (1, 2) in a 2x2 grid, the number 4 cannot move further.\n   - The matrix remains unchanged after the second move:\n     ```\n     0, 4\n     0, 16\n     ```\n\n5. **Final Matrix:**\n   - After executing the sequence 'rr', the final matrix is:\n     ```\n     0, 4\n     0, 16\n     ```\n\nTherefore, the matrix after moving is <<<0, 4; 0, 16>>>."
