  "question": "In an 3x3 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (1, 1) using the sequence 'rur':\n8, 2, 0\n16, 0, 0\n2, 0, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'rur' for the number in position (1, 1) in the given 3x3 grid. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Grid:**\n   ```\n   8, 2, 0\n   16, 0, 0\n   2, 0, 0\n   ```\n\n2. **First Move (r - right):**\n   - We move the number at position (1, 1), which is 8, to the right.\n   - The number 8 moves to position (1, 2), where there is a 2. Since 8 and 2 are not the same, they do not combine.\n   - The grid after this move:\n     ```\n     0, 8, 2\n     16, 0, 0\n     2, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n3. **Second Move (u - up):**\n   - We move the number at position (1, 2), which is 8, up.\n   - The number 8 moves to position (0, 2), where there is a 0. Since 8 and 0 are not the same, they do not combine.\n   - The grid after this move:\n     ```\n     0, 8, 2\n     16, 0, 0\n     2, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n4. **Third Move (r - right):**\n   - We move the number at position (0, 2), which is 8, to the right.\n   - The number 8 moves to position (0, 3), which is outside the grid. However, since the grid is 3x3, we assume the number stays at the edge.\n   - The grid remains unchanged:\n     ```\n     0, 8, 2\n     16, 0, 0\n     2, 0, 0\n     ```\n\nAfter following the sequence 'rur', the final grid is:\n\n<<<0, 8, 2; 16, 0, 0; 2, 0, 0>>>"
