    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'dludrd' starting from the position (2, 5) in the given 5x5 grid. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   ```\n   0, 16, 0, 0, 32\n   0, 0, 0, 4, 0\n   0, 0, 0, 0, 32\n   8, 0, 0, 0, 0\n   0, 32, 4, 8, 0\n   ```\n\n2. **Starting Position:**\n   - The number at position (2, 5) is 0.\n\n3. **Move Sequence: 'dludrd'**\n\n   - **d (down):** Move the number at (2, 5) down to (3, 5).\n     - The number at (3, 5) is 32. Since the number we are moving is 0, it remains unchanged.\n     - Matrix remains unchanged.\n\n   - **l (left):** Move the number at (3, 5) left to (3, 4).\n     - The number at (3, 4) is 0. Since the number we are moving is 32, it moves to (3, 4).\n     - Updated Matrix:\n       ```\n       0, 16, 0, 0, 32\n       0, 0, 0, 4, 0\n       0, 0, 0, 32, 0\n       8, 0, 0, 0, 0\n       0, 32, 4, 8, 0\n       ```\n\n   - **u (up):** Move the number at (3, 4) up to (2, 4).\n     - The number at (2, 4) is 4. Since the number we are moving is 32, it remains unchanged.\n     - Matrix remains unchanged.\n\n   - **d (down):** Move the number at (2, 4) down to (3, 4).\n     - The number at (3, 4) is 32. Since the number we are moving is 4, it remains unchanged.\n     - Matrix remains unchanged.\n\n   - **r (right):** Move the number at (3, 4) right to (3, 5).\n     - The number at (3, 5) is 0. Since the number we are moving is 32, it moves to (3, 5).\n     - Updated Matrix:\n       ```\n       0, 16, 0, 0, 32\n       0, 0, 0, 4, 0\n       0, 0, 0, 0, 32\n       8, 0, 0, 0, 0\n       0, 32, 4, 8, 0\n       ```\n\n   - **d (down):** Move the number at (3, 5) down to (4, 5).\n     - The number at (4, 5) is 0. Since the number we are moving is 32, it moves to (4, 5).\n     - Updated Matrix:\n       ```\n       0, 16, 0, 0, 32\n       0, 0, 0, 4, 0\n       0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n       8, 0, 0, 0, 32\n       0, 32, 4, 8, 0\n       ```\n\n4. **Final Matrix:**\n   ```\n   0, 16, 0, 0, 32\n   0, 0, 0, 4, 0\n   0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n   8, 0, 0, 0, 32\n   0, 32, 4, 8, 0\n   ```\n\nThe final matrix after performing the sequence of moves is:\n\n<<<\n0, 16, 0, 0, 32\n0, 0, 0, 4, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n8, 0, 0, 0, 32\n0, 32, 4, 8, 0\n>>>"
