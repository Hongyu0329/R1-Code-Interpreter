  "question": "In an 2x2 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (2, 2) using the sequence 'dl':\n0, 8\n2, 2\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'dl' (down, left) for the number in position (2, 2) in the given 2x2 grid. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   ```\n   0, 8\n   2, 2\n   ```\n   The number at position (2, 2) is 2.\n\n2. **First Move (d - down):**\n   - The number at position (2, 2) moves down. However, since it is already at the bottom row, it cannot move further down. Therefore, the grid remains unchanged after this move.\n   - Matrix after the 'd' move:\n     ```\n     0, 8\n     2, 2\n     ```\n\n3. **Second Move (l - left):**\n   - Now, we move the number at position (2, 2) to the left. It moves to position (2, 1).\n   - After moving, we check if it can combine with the number at position (2, 1). The number at (2, 1) is also 2, which is the same power of 2.\n   - Since they are the same, they combine to form the next power of 2, which is 4.\n   - The number at position (2, 1) becomes 4, and position (2, 2) becomes 0 (since the number has moved and combined).\n   - Matrix after the 'l' move:\n     ```\n     0, 8\n     4, 0\n     ```\n\n4. **Final Matrix:**\n   After executing the sequence 'dl', the final matrix is:\n   ```\n   0, 8\n   4, 0\n   ```\n\nTherefore, the matrix after moving is <<<0, 8; 4, 0>>>."
