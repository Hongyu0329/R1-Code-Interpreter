  "question": "In an 2x2 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (1, 2) using the sequence 'dl':\n0, 16\n4, 2\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'dl' for the number in position (1, 2) in the given 2x2 grid. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Grid:**\n   ```\n   0, 16\n   4, 2\n   ```\n   The number in position (1, 2) is 16.\n\n2. **Move 'd' (down):**\n   - The number 16 at position (1, 2) moves down to position (2, 2).\n   - The grid now looks like this:\n     ```\n     0, 0\n     4, 16\n     ```\n\n3. **Move 'l' (left):**\n   - The number 16 at position (2, 2) moves left to position (2, 1).\n   - The number 4 at position (2, 1) is also a power of 2, but it is not the same as 16, so they do not combine.\n   - The grid now looks like this:\n     ```\n     0, 0\n     16, 4\n     ```\n\nAfter performing the sequence of moves 'dl', the final grid is:\n```\n<<<0, 0; 16, 4>>>\n```"
