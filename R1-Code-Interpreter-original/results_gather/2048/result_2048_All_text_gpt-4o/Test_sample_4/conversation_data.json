  "question": "In an 2x2 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (2, 1) using the sequence 'dd':\n4, 8\n4, 2\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the movement of the number in position (2, 1) using the sequence 'dd' in the given 2x2 grid. The initial grid is:\n\n```\n4, 8\n4, 2\n```\n\nThe position (2, 1) corresponds to the number 4 in the second row, first column. The sequence 'dd' indicates that we need to move this number down two steps. However, since the grid is only 2x2, moving down from the second row is not possible. Let's analyze the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Position**: The number 4 is at position (2, 1).\n\n2. **First 'd' Move**: \n   - Attempt to move the number 4 down from position (2, 1).\n   - Since the grid is only 2 rows, moving down from the second row is not possible. The number remains in the same position (2, 1).\n\n3. **Second 'd' Move**:\n   - Again, attempt to move the number 4 down from position (2, 1).\n   - As before, moving down from the second row is not possible. The number remains in the same position (2, 1).\n\nSince the number cannot move beyond the grid boundaries, it stays in its original position throughout the sequence. Therefore, the grid remains unchanged after applying the sequence 'dd'.\n\nThe final matrix is:\n\n```\n4, 8\n4, 2\n```\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<4, 8; 4, 2>>>"
