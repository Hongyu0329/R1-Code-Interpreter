    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'uulll' for the number located at position (4, 3) in the given 5x5 grid. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Grid:**\n   ```\n   8, 0, 0, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 0, 8, 0\n   0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n   0, 32, 0, 16, 32\n   ```\n   The number at position (4, 3) is 16.\n\n2. **First Move ('u'):**\n   - Move the number at (4, 3) up to (3, 3).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     8, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 16, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 32, 0, 0, 32\n     ```\n\n3. **Second Move ('u'):**\n   - Move the number at (3, 3) up to (2, 3).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     8, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 16, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 32, 0, 0, 32\n     ```\n\n4. **First Move ('l'):**\n   - Move the number at (2, 3) left to (2, 2).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     8, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 16, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 32, 0, 0, 32\n     ```\n\n5. **Second Move ('l'):**\n   - Move the number at (2, 2) left to (2, 1).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     8, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 16, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 32, 0, 0, 32\n     ```\n\n6. **Third Move ('l'):**\n   - Move the number at (2, 1) left to (2, 0).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     8, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     16, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 32, 0, 0, 32\n     ```\n\nAfter performing all the moves, the final grid is:\n\n<<<\n8, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n16, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 32, 0, 0, 32\n>>>"
