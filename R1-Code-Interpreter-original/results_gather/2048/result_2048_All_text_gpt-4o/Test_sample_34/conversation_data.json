  "question": "In an 3x3 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (3, 3) using the sequence 'lrl':\n32, 0, 0\n2, 4, 0\n32, 0, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'lrl' for the number in position (3, 3) of the given 3x3 grid. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   ```\n   32, 0, 0\n   2, 4, 0\n   32, 0, 0\n   ```\n   The number at position (3, 3) is 0.\n\n2. **First Move (l - left):**\n   - We move the number at position (3, 3) to the left.\n   - The number 0 at (3, 3) moves to (3, 2).\n   - The matrix becomes:\n     ```\n     32, 0, 0\n     2, 4, 0\n     32, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n3. **Second Move (r - right):**\n   - We move the number at position (3, 2) to the right.\n   - The number 0 at (3, 2) moves to (3, 3).\n   - The matrix remains unchanged:\n     ```\n     32, 0, 0\n     2, 4, 0\n     32, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n4. **Third Move (l - left):**\n   - We move the number at position (3, 3) to the left.\n   - The number 0 at (3, 3) moves to (3, 2).\n   - The matrix remains unchanged:\n     ```\n     32, 0, 0\n     2, 4, 0\n     32, 0, 0\n     ```\n\nThroughout these moves, the number 0 does not change the matrix because it does not combine with any other numbers. Therefore, the final matrix after performing the sequence 'lrl' is:\n\n<<<32, 0, 0; 2, 4, 0; 32, 0, 0>>>"
