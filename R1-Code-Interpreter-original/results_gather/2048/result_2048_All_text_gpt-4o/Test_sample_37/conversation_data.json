  "question": "In an 3x3 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (3, 2) using the sequence 'uuu':\n0, 0, 0\n4, 32, 0\n0, 4, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the movement of the number in position (3, 2) using the sequence 'uuu' in the given 3x3 grid. The initial grid is:\n\n```\n0, 0, 0\n4, 32, 0\n0, 4, 0\n```\n\nThe number at position (3, 2) is 4. We will move this number up three times according to the sequence 'uuu'. Let's go through each step:\n\n1. **First Move (u):**\n   - The number 4 at position (3, 2) moves up to position (2, 2).\n   - The grid now looks like this:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0\n     4, 32, 0\n     0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n2. **Second Move (u):**\n   - The number 4 at position (2, 2) moves up to position (1, 2).\n   - The grid now looks like this:\n     ```\n     0, 4, 0\n     4, 32, 0\n     0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n3. **Third Move (u):**\n   - The number 4 at position (1, 2) moves up, but since it is already at the top row, it cannot move further up. Therefore, it stays at position (1, 2).\n   - The grid remains:\n     ```\n     0, 4, 0\n     4, 32, 0\n     0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\nAfter applying the sequence 'uuu', the final grid is:\n\n```\n<<<0, 4, 0\n4, 32, 0\n0, 0, 0>>>\n```"
