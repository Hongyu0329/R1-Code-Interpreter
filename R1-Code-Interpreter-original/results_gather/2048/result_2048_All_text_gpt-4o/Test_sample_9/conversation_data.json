  "question": "In an 2x2 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (1, 1) using the sequence 'ur':\n8, 0\n4, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'ur' (up, then right) for the number in position (1, 1) in the given 2x2 grid. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   ```\n   8, 0\n   4, 0\n   ```\n   The number at position (1, 1) is 8.\n\n2. **Move 'u' (up):**\n   - The number 8 at position (1, 1) attempts to move up.\n   - Since it is already at the top row, moving up does not change its position.\n   - The matrix remains:\n     ```\n     8, 0\n     4, 0\n     ```\n\n3. **Move 'r' (right):**\n   - The number 8 at position (1, 1) moves right to position (1, 2).\n   - The number 0 at position (1, 2) does not affect the movement since it is not a power of 2.\n   - The matrix after this move becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 8\n     4, 0\n     ```\n\n4. **Final Matrix:**\n   - After executing the sequence 'ur', the final matrix is:\n     ```\n     0, 8\n     4, 0\n     ```\n\nTherefore, the matrix after moving the number in position (1, 1) using the sequence 'ur' is:\n\n<<<0, 8; 4, 0>>>"
