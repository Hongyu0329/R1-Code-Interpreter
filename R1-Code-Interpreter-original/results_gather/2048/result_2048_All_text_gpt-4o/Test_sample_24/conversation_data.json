  "question": "In an 3x3 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (3, 1) using the sequence 'rdl':\n0, 0, 0\n2, 4, 2\n2, 0, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'rdl' (right, down, left) for the number in position (3, 1) of the given 3x3 grid. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   ```\n   0, 0, 0\n   2, 4, 2\n   2, 0, 0\n   ```\n   The number at position (3, 1) is 2.\n\n2. **Move 'r' (right):**\n   - The number 2 at position (3, 1) moves to position (3, 2).\n   - The matrix now looks like:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0\n     2, 4, 2\n     0, 2, 0\n     ```\n\n3. **Move 'd' (down):**\n   - Since the number is already in the last row, moving down does not change its position. The number 2 remains at position (3, 2).\n   - The matrix remains:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0\n     2, 4, 2\n     0, 2, 0\n     ```\n\n4. **Move 'l' (left):**\n   - The number 2 at position (3, 2) moves to position (3, 1).\n   - The matrix now looks like:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0\n     2, 4, 2\n     2, 0, 0\n     ```\n\nAfter following the sequence 'rdl', the final matrix is:\n```\n<<<0, 0, 0\n2, 4, 2\n2, 0, 0>>>\n```"
