    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'dlul' for the number in position (2, 1) in the given 4x4 grid. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Grid:**\n   ```\n   0, 32, 8, 0\n   0, 0, 0, 0\n   8, 0, 0, 32\n   16, 0, 0, 0\n   ```\n   The number at position (2, 1) is 8.\n\n2. **Move 'd' (down):**\n   - The number 8 at (2, 1) moves down to (3, 1).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 32, 8, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 32\n     16, 8, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n3. **Move 'l' (left):**\n   - The number 8 at (3, 1) moves left to (3, 0).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 32, 8, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0\n     8, 0, 0, 32\n     16, 0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n4. **Move 'u' (up):**\n   - The number 8 at (3, 0) moves up to (2, 0).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 32, 8, 0\n     8, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 32\n     16, 0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n5. **Move 'l' (left):**\n   - The number 8 at (2, 0) cannot move further left as it is already at the leftmost column.\n   - The grid remains unchanged:\n     ```\n     0, 32, 8, 0\n     8, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 32\n     16, 0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\nAfter executing the sequence 'dlul', the final grid is:\n\n<<<\n0, 32, 8, 0\n8, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 32\n16, 0, 0, 0\n>>>"
