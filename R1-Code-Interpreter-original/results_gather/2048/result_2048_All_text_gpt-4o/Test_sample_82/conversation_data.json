  "question": "In an 5x5 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (1, 3) using the sequence 'uldlur':\n0, 8, 16, 2, 2\n2, 8, 0, 0, 0\n0, 4, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n8, 0, 8, 0, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves for the number located at position (1, 3) in the given 5x5 grid. The initial grid is:\n\n```\n0, 8, 16, 2, 2\n2, 8, 0, 0, 0\n0, 4, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n8, 0, 8, 0, 0\n```\n\nThe number at position (1, 3) is 0. We will follow the sequence 'uldlur' and analyze each step:\n\n1. **Initial Position**: (1, 3) with value 0.\n\n2. **Move 'u' (up)**: \n   - Current position: (1, 3)\n   - New position: (0, 3)\n   - The number at (0, 3) is 2. Since 0 does not combine with any number, the grid remains unchanged.\n\n3. **Move 'l' (left)**:\n   - Current position: (0, 3)\n   - New position: (0, 2)\n   - The number at (0, 2) is 16. Again, 0 does not combine with any number, so the grid remains unchanged.\n\n4. **Move 'd' (down)**:\n   - Current position: (0, 2)\n   - New position: (1, 2)\n   - The number at (1, 2) is 0. No change occurs.\n\n5. **Move 'l' (left)**:\n   - Current position: (1, 2)\n   - New position: (1, 1)\n   - The number at (1, 1) is 8. No change occurs.\n\n6. **Move 'u' (up)**:\n   - Current position: (1, 1)\n   - New position: (0, 1)\n   - The number at (0, 1) is 8. No change occurs.\n\n7. **Move 'r' (right)**:\n   - Current position: (0, 1)\n   - New position: (0, 2)\n   - The number at (0, 2) is 16. No change occurs.\n\nAfter following the sequence 'uldlur', the grid remains unchanged because the number 0 does not affect any other numbers in the grid. Therefore, the final matrix is:\n\n```\n0, 8, 16, 2, 2\n2, 8, 0, 0, 0\n0, 4, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n8, 0, 8, 0, 0\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<0, 8, 16, 2, 2; 2, 8, 0, 0, 0; 0, 4, 0, 0, 0; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0; 8, 0, 8, 0, 0>>>"
