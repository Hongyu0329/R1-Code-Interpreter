  "question": "In an 5x5 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (2, 5) using the sequence 'udldu':\n0, 16, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 16, 0\n0, 0, 16, 0, 0\n0, 0, 32, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 2\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves for the number located at position (2, 5) in the given 5x5 grid. The initial grid is:\n\n```\n0, 16, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 16, 0\n0, 0, 16, 0, 0\n0, 0, 32, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 2\n```\n\nThe number at position (2, 5) is 0, so initially, there is no number to move. However, we will follow the sequence 'udldu' to see how the grid changes:\n\n1. **Move 'u' (up):**\n   - The number at (2, 5) is 0, so moving up does not change the grid. The grid remains the same.\n\n2. **Move 'd' (down):**\n   - Again, the number at (2, 5) is 0, so moving down does not change the grid. The grid remains the same.\n\n3. **Move 'l' (left):**\n   - The number at (2, 5) is 0, so moving left does not change the grid. The grid remains the same.\n\n4. **Move 'd' (down):**\n   - The number at (2, 5) is 0, so moving down does not change the grid. The grid remains the same.\n\n5. **Move 'u' (up):**\n   - The number at (2, 5) is 0, so moving up does not change the grid. The grid remains the same.\n\nSince the number at (2, 5) is 0, none of the moves affect the grid. Therefore, the grid remains unchanged after the sequence of moves.\n\nThe final matrix is:\n\n```\n0, 16, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 16, 0\n0, 0, 16, 0, 0\n0, 0, 32, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 2\n```\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<0, 16, 0, 0, 0; 0, 0, 0, 16, 0; 0, 0, 16, 0, 0; 0, 0, 32, 0, 0; 0, 0, 0, 0, 2>>>"
