  "question": "In an 4x4 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (1, 4) using the sequence 'lrud':\n2, 4, 32, 0\n0, 0, 16, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0\n2, 8, 0, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'lrud' for the number in position (1, 4) of the given 4x4 grid. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   ```\n   2, 4, 32, 0\n   0, 0, 16, 0\n   0, 0, 0, 0\n   2, 8, 0, 0\n   ```\n   The number at position (1, 4) is 0.\n\n2. **Move 'l' (left):**\n   - The number 0 at position (1, 4) moves left to position (1, 3).\n   - Since it is 0, it does not affect the grid.\n   - The matrix remains unchanged:\n     ```\n     2, 4, 32, 0\n     0, 0, 16, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0\n     2, 8, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n3. **Move 'r' (right):**\n   - The number 0 at position (1, 3) moves right to position (1, 4).\n   - Again, since it is 0, it does not affect the grid.\n   - The matrix remains unchanged:\n     ```\n     2, 4, 32, 0\n     0, 0, 16, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0\n     2, 8, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n4. **Move 'u' (up):**\n   - The number 0 at position (1, 4) moves up to position (1, 4).\n   - Since it is 0, it does not affect the grid.\n   - The matrix remains unchanged:\n     ```\n     2, 4, 32, 0\n     0, 0, 16, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0\n     2, 8, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n5. **Move 'd' (down):**\n   - The number 0 at position (1, 4) moves down to position (2, 4).\n   - Since it is 0, it does not affect the grid.\n   - The matrix remains unchanged:\n     ```\n     2, 4, 32, 0\n     0, 0, 16, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0\n     2, 8, 0, 0\n     ```\n\nAfter following the sequence 'lrud', the matrix remains unchanged because the number at position (1, 4) was 0, and moving 0 does not affect the grid.\n\nFinal answer:\n<<<2, 4, 32, 0; 0, 0, 16, 0; 0, 0, 0, 0; 2, 8, 0, 0>>>"
