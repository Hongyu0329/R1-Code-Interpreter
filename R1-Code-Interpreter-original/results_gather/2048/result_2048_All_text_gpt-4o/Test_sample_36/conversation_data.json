  "question": "In an 3x3 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (1, 1) using the sequence 'ull':\n0, 4, 0\n16, 16, 4\n0, 32, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'ull' for the number in position (1, 1) of the given 3x3 grid. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Grid:**\n   ```\n   0, 4, 0\n   16, 16, 4\n   0, 32, 0\n   ```\n\n2. **Identify the Starting Position:**\n   - The number at position (1, 1) is 16.\n\n3. **First Move ('u' - move up):**\n   - The number 16 at position (1, 1) moves up to position (0, 1).\n   - The grid now looks like this:\n     ```\n     0, 16, 0\n     0, 4, 0\n     0, 32, 0\n     ```\n\n4. **Second Move ('l' - move left):**\n   - The number 16 at position (0, 1) moves left to position (0, 0).\n   - The grid now looks like this:\n     ```\n     16, 0, 0\n     0, 4, 0\n     0, 32, 0\n     ```\n\n5. **Third Move ('l' - move left again):**\n   - The number 16 at position (0, 0) attempts to move left, but it is already at the leftmost position of the grid. Therefore, it remains in the same position.\n   - The grid remains unchanged:\n     ```\n     16, 0, 0\n     0, 4, 0\n     0, 32, 0\n     ```\n\n6. **Final Grid:**\n   - After executing the sequence 'ull', the final grid is:\n     ```\n     16, 0, 0\n     0, 4, 0\n     0, 32, 0\n     ```\n\nTherefore, the matrix after moving is <<<16, 0, 0; 0, 4, 0; 0, 32, 0>>>."
