    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves for the number located at position (2, 2) in the given 5x5 grid. The initial grid is:\n\n```\n0, 0, 0, 0, 2\n0, 32, 2, 0, 0\n0, 4, 16, 0, 2\n32, 0, 32, 2, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n```\n\nThe number at position (2, 2) is 2. We will move this number according to the sequence 'duldrl'. Let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **Move 'd' (down):**\n   - The number 2 at (2, 2) moves down to (3, 2).\n   - The grid now looks like this:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 2\n     0, 32, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 4, 16, 0, 2\n     32, 0, 2, 2, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n2. **Move 'u' (up):**\n   - The number 2 at (3, 2) moves up to (2, 2).\n   - The grid now looks like this:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 2\n     0, 32, 2, 0, 0\n     0, 4, 16, 0, 2\n     32, 0, 0, 2, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n3. **Move 'l' (left):**\n   - The number 2 at (2, 2) moves left to (2, 1).\n   - The grid now looks like this:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 2\n     0, 32, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 6, 16, 0, 2\n     32, 0, 0, 2, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n4. **Move 'd' (down):**\n   - The number 6 at (2, 1) moves down to (3, 1).\n   - The grid now looks like this:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 2\n     0, 32, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 16, 0, 2\n     32, 6, 0, 2, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n5. **Move 'r' (right):**\n   - The number 6 at (3, 1) moves right to (3, 2).\n   - The grid now looks like this:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 2\n     0, 32, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 16, 0, 2\n     32, 0, 6, 2, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n6. **Move 'l' (left):**\n   - The number 6 at (3, 2) moves left to (3, 1).\n   - The grid now looks like this:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 2\n     0, 32, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 16, 0, 2\n     32, 6, 0, 2, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\nAfter following the sequence 'duldrl', the final grid is:\n\n```\n0, 0, 0, 0, 2\n0, 32, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 16, 0, 2\n32, 6, 0, 2, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0, 0, 0, 0, 2; 0, 32, 0, 0, 0; 0, 0, 16, 0, 2; 32, 6, 0, 2, 0; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0>>>"
