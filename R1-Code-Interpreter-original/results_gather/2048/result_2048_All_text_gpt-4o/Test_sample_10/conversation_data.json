  "question": "In an 2x2 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (2, 2) using the sequence 'lr':\n8, 4\n16, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the movement of the number in position (2, 2) according to the given sequence 'lr' (left, right). Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   ```\n   8, 4\n   16, 0\n   ```\n   The number in position (2, 2) is 0.\n\n2. **Move 'l' (left):**\n   - The number 0 in position (2, 2) moves left to position (2, 1).\n   - The matrix after this move:\n     ```\n     8, 4\n     0, 16\n     ```\n   - Since 0 is not a power of 2, it does not combine with 16.\n\n3. **Move 'r' (right):**\n   - The number 0 in position (2, 1) moves right to position (2, 2).\n   - The matrix after this move:\n     ```\n     8, 4\n     16, 0\n     ```\n   - Again, since 0 is not a power of 2, it does not combine with 16.\n\nAfter executing the sequence 'lr', the matrix remains unchanged because moving 0 does not affect the other numbers in the grid.\n\nFinal matrix:\n```\n<<<8, 4\n16, 0>>>\n```"
