  "question": "In an 2x2 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (1, 1) using the sequence 'rd':\n16, 32\n8, 16\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'rd' (right, then down) for the number in position (1, 1) of the given 2x2 grid. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   ```\n   16, 32\n   8, 16\n   ```\n   The number at position (1, 1) is 16.\n\n2. **First Move (r - right):**\n   - The number 16 at position (1, 1) moves to position (1, 2).\n   - The number at position (1, 2) is 32.\n   - Since 16 and 32 are different powers of 2, they do not combine.\n   - After the move, the matrix looks like this:\n     ```\n     0, 16\n     8, 16\n     ```\n   - Here, 0 represents the empty space left by the moved number.\n\n3. **Second Move (d - down):**\n   - The number 16 at position (1, 2) moves to position (2, 2).\n   - The number at position (2, 2) is 16.\n   - Since both numbers are the same power of 2, they combine to form 32.\n   - After the move and combination, the matrix looks like this:\n     ```\n     0, 0\n     8, 32\n     ```\n\nThus, after executing the sequence 'rd', the final matrix is:\n\n<<<0, 0; 8, 32>>>"
