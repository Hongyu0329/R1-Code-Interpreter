    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves for the number located at position (2, 4) in the given 5x5 grid. The sequence of moves is 'dldur'. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Position**: The number at position (2, 4) is 16.\n\n2. **Move 'd' (down)**: \n   - The number 16 moves from position (2, 4) to position (3, 4).\n   - The grid now looks like this:\n     ```\n     8, 0, 0, 32, 0\n     4, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 16\n     2, 4, 0, 2, 4\n     4, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n3. **Move 'l' (left)**:\n   - The number 16 moves from position (3, 4) to position (3, 3).\n   - The grid now looks like this:\n     ```\n     8, 0, 0, 32, 0\n     4, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 16, 0\n     2, 4, 0, 2, 4\n     4, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n4. **Move 'd' (down)**:\n   - The number 16 moves from position (3, 3) to position (4, 3).\n   - The grid now looks like this:\n     ```\n     8, 0, 0, 32, 0\n     4, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     2, 4, 0, 16, 4\n     4, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n5. **Move 'u' (up)**:\n   - The number 16 moves from position (4, 3) to position (3, 3).\n   - The grid now looks like this:\n     ```\n     8, 0, 0, 32, 0\n     4, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 16, 0\n     2, 4, 0, 0, 4\n     4, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n6. **Move 'r' (right)**:\n   - The number 16 moves from position (3, 3) to position (3, 4).\n   - The grid now looks like this:\n     ```\n     8, 0, 0, 32, 0\n     4, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 16\n     2, 4, 0, 0, 4\n     4, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\nAfter following the sequence 'dldur', the final matrix is:\n\n<<<8, 0, 0, 32, 0; 4, 0, 0, 0, 0; 0, 0, 0, 0, 16; 2, 4, 0, 0, 4; 4, 0, 0, 0, 0>>>"
