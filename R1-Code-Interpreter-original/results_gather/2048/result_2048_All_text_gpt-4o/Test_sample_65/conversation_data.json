  "question": "In an 5x5 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (3, 3) using the sequence 'rrldd':\n0, 0, 0, 8, 0\n0, 16, 0, 16, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 8\n0, 2, 2, 0, 16\n2, 0, 0, 2, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'rrldd' starting from the position (3, 3) in the given 5x5 grid. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Position (3, 3):** The number at this position is 0.\n\n2. **Move 'r' (right):** \n   - From (3, 3) to (3, 4).\n   - The number at (3, 4) is 0, so the number remains 0.\n\n3. **Move 'r' (right):**\n   - From (3, 4) to (3, 5).\n   - The number at (3, 5) is 8. Since 0 does not combine with any number, the number remains 0.\n\n4. **Move 'l' (left):**\n   - From (3, 5) to (3, 4).\n   - The number at (3, 4) is 0, so the number remains 0.\n\n5. **Move 'd' (down):**\n   - From (3, 4) to (4, 4).\n   - The number at (4, 4) is 16. Since 0 does not combine with any number, the number remains 0.\n\n6. **Move 'd' (down):**\n   - From (4, 4) to (5, 4).\n   - The number at (5, 4) is 2. Since 0 does not combine with any number, the number remains 0.\n\nAfter following the sequence of moves, the number remains 0 and does not affect any other numbers in the grid. Therefore, the matrix remains unchanged.\n\nThe final matrix is:\n<<<\n0, 0, 0, 8, 0\n0, 16, 0, 16, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 8\n0, 2, 2, 0, 16\n2, 0, 0, 2, 0\n>>>"
