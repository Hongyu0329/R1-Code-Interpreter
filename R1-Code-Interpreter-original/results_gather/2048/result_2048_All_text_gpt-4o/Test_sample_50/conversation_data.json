  "question": "In an 4x4 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (4, 1) using the sequence 'udul':\n4, 8, 0, 8\n16, 0, 0, 0\n16, 2, 0, 0\n0, 32, 16, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'udul' for the number in position (4, 1) of the given 4x4 grid. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Grid:**\n   ```\n   4, 8, 0, 8\n   16, 0, 0, 0\n   16, 2, 0, 0\n   0, 32, 16, 0\n   ```\n   The number at position (4, 1) is 0.\n\n2. **Move 'u' (up one step):**\n   - The number at (4, 1) moves to (3, 1).\n   - The grid remains unchanged because the number is 0.\n\n3. **Move 'd' (down one step):**\n   - The number at (3, 1) moves back to (4, 1).\n   - The grid remains unchanged because the number is 0.\n\n4. **Move 'u' (up one step):**\n   - The number at (4, 1) moves to (3, 1).\n   - The grid remains unchanged because the number is 0.\n\n5. **Move 'l' (left one step):**\n   - The number at (3, 1) moves to (3, 0).\n   - The grid remains unchanged because the number is 0.\n\nSince the number we are moving is 0, it does not affect the grid during any of the moves. Therefore, the grid remains unchanged after the sequence of moves.\n\nFinal Grid:\n```\n4, 8, 0, 8\n16, 0, 0, 0\n16, 2, 0, 0\n0, 32, 16, 0\n```\n\nThe matrix after moving is: <<<4, 8, 0, 8; 16, 0, 0, 0; 16, 2, 0, 0; 0, 32, 16, 0>>>."
