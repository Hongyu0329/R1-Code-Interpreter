  "question": "In an 4x4 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32.

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'uuul' for the number in position (4, 4) in the given 4x4 grid. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Grid:**\n   ```\n   4, 0, 0, 0\n   0, 2, 32, 0\n   0, 0, 0, 16\n   0, 0, 0, 0\n   ```\n\n2. **Initial Position of the Number:**\n   - The number at position (4, 4) is 0.\n\n3. **Move 1: 'u' (up one step)**\n   - Move the number at (4, 4) to (3, 4).\n   - The number at (3, 4) is 16, and the number at (4, 4) is 0. Since 0 does not affect the number 16, the grid remains unchanged.\n\n4. **Move 2: 'u' (up one step)**\n   - Move the number at (3, 4) to (2, 4).\n   - The number at (2, 4) is 0, and the number at (3, 4) is 16. The grid remains unchanged.\n\n5. **Move 3: 'u' (up one step)**\n   - Move the number at (2, 4) to (1, 4).\n   - The number at (1, 4) is 0, and the number at (2, 4) is 0. The grid remains unchanged.\n\n6. **Move 4: 'l' (left one step)**\n   - Move the number at (1, 4) to (1, 3).\n   - The number at (1, 3) is 0, and the number at (1, 4) is 0. The grid remains unchanged.\n\n7. **Final Grid:**\n   - After all the moves, the grid remains unchanged because the number at (4, 4) was 0, and moving 0 does not affect any other numbers in the grid.\n\nTherefore, the final matrix after performing the sequence 'uuul' is:\n\n<<<\n4, 0, 0, 0\n0, 2, 32, 0\n0, 0, 0, 16\n0, 0, 0, 0\n>>>"
