  "question": "In an 4x4 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32.

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'uddd' for the number located at position (4, 2) in the given 4x4 grid. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   ```\n   0, 0, 0, 32\n   0, 8, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 16, 4\n   32, 32, 4, 0\n   ```\n   The number at position (4, 2) is 32.\n\n2. **Move 'u' (up one step):**\n   - The number 32 at (4, 2) moves up to (3, 2).\n   - The matrix becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 32\n     0, 8, 0, 0\n     0, 32, 16, 4\n     32, 0, 4, 0\n     ```\n\n3. **Move 'd' (down one step):**\n   - The number 32 at (3, 2) moves down to (4, 2).\n   - The matrix becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 32\n     0, 8, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 16, 4\n     32, 32, 4, 0\n     ```\n\n4. **Move 'd' (down one step):**\n   - The number 32 at (4, 2) cannot move further down as it is already at the bottom row.\n   - The matrix remains unchanged:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 32\n     0, 8, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 16, 4\n     32, 32, 4, 0\n     ```\n\n5. **Move 'd' (down one step):**\n   - Again, the number 32 at (4, 2) cannot move further down.\n   - The matrix remains unchanged:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 32\n     0, 8, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 16, 4\n     32, 32, 4, 0\n     ```\n\nAfter following the sequence 'uddd', the final matrix is:\n\n<<<0, 0, 0, 32; 0, 8, 0, 0; 0, 0, 16, 4; 32, 32, 4, 0>>>"
