  "question": "In an 4x4 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (3, 1) using the sequence 'uuud':\n0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 16, 32\n16, 32, 4, 4\n0, 4, 0, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'uuud' for the number located at position (3, 1) in the given 4x4 grid. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   ```\n   0, 0, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 16, 32\n   16, 32, 4, 4\n   0, 4, 0, 0\n   ```\n\n2. **Identify the Starting Position:**\n   - The number at position (3, 1) is 0.\n\n3. **Move 1: 'u' (up one step)**\n   - Move the number at (3, 1) to (2, 1).\n   - The number at (2, 1) is 32, and the number at (3, 1) is 0, so no combination occurs.\n   - Updated Matrix:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 16, 32\n     16, 0, 4, 4\n     0, 4, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n4. **Move 2: 'u' (up one step)**\n   - Move the number at (2, 1) to (1, 1).\n   - The number at (1, 1) is 0, and the number at (2, 1) is 0, so no combination occurs.\n   - Updated Matrix:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 16, 32\n     16, 0, 4, 4\n     0, 4, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n5. **Move 3: 'u' (up one step)**\n   - Move the number at (1, 1) to (0, 1).\n   - The number at (0, 1) is 0, and the number at (1, 1) is 0, so no combination occurs.\n   - Updated Matrix:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 16, 32\n     16, 0, 4, 4\n     0, 4, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n6. **Move 4: 'd' (down one step)**\n   - Move the number at (0, 1) to (1, 1).\n   - The number at (1, 1) is 0, and the number at (0, 1) is 0, so no combination occurs.\n   - Final Matrix:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 16, 32\n     16, 0, 4, 4\n     0, 4, 0, 0\n     ```\n\nAfter following the sequence 'uuud', the matrix remains unchanged because the number at the starting position was 0, and moving 0 does not affect the grid. \n\nThe final matrix is:\n<<<0, 0, 0, 0; 0, 0, 16, 32; 16, 0, 4, 4; 0, 4, 0, 0>>>"
