  "question": "In an 3x3 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (3, 2) using the sequence 'uul':\n16, 16, 16\n0, 0, 16\n0, 4, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'uul' for the number in position (3, 2) of the given 3x3 grid. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Grid:**\n   ```\n   16, 16, 16\n   0, 0, 16\n   0, 4, 0\n   ```\n   The number at position (3, 2) is 4.\n\n2. **First Move (u - move up):**\n   - Move the number 4 from position (3, 2) to position (2, 2).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     16, 16, 16\n     0, 4, 16\n     0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n3. **Second Move (u - move up):**\n   - Move the number 4 from position (2, 2) to position (1, 2).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     16, 20, 16\n     0, 0, 16\n     0, 0, 0\n     ```\n   - Note: The number 4 combines with the number 16 at position (1, 2) to form 20 (since 4 + 16 = 20).\n\n4. **Third Move (l - move left):**\n   - Move the number 20 from position (1, 2) to position (1, 1).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     36, 0, 16\n     0, 0, 16\n     0, 0, 0\n     ```\n   - Note: The number 20 combines with the number 16 at position (1, 1) to form 36 (since 20 + 16 = 36).\n\nAfter following the sequence 'uul', the final grid is:\n```\n36, 0, 16\n0, 0, 16\n0, 0, 0\n```\n\nTherefore, the matrix after moving is:\n<<<36, 0, 16; 0, 0, 16; 0, 0, 0>>>"
