  "question": "In an 3x3 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (3, 2) using the sequence 'dlr':\n0, 16, 32\n0, 0, 32\n16, 4, 2\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'dlr' for the number in position (3, 2) of the given 3x3 grid. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Grid:**\n   ```\n   0, 16, 32\n   0, 0, 32\n   16, 4, 2\n   ```\n   The number at position (3, 2) is 4.\n\n2. **Move 'd' (down):**\n   - The number 4 at position (3, 2) attempts to move down.\n   - Since it is already at the bottom row, it cannot move further down.\n   - The grid remains unchanged:\n     ```\n     0, 16, 32\n     0, 0, 32\n     16, 4, 2\n     ```\n\n3. **Move 'l' (left):**\n   - The number 4 at position (3, 2) moves left to position (3, 1).\n   - The number 16 is already at position (3, 1), which is a different power of 2.\n   - Therefore, the numbers do not combine, and the grid becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 16, 32\n     0, 0, 32\n     4, 16, 2\n     ```\n\n4. **Move 'r' (right):**\n   - The number 4 at position (3, 1) moves right to position (3, 2).\n   - The number 16 is at position (3, 2), which is a different power of 2.\n   - Therefore, the numbers do not combine, and the grid becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 16, 32\n     0, 0, 32\n     16, 4, 2\n     ```\n\nAfter following the sequence 'dlr', the final grid is:\n```\n<<<0, 16, 32; 0, 0, 32; 16, 4, 2>>>\n```"
