  "question": "In an 5x5 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (5, 5) using the sequence 'uldll':\n0, 32, 0, 4, 0\n0, 0, 0, 4, 0\n0, 0, 0, 32, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n16, 32, 0, 0, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'uldll' for the number located at position (5, 5) in the given 5x5 grid. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Position**: The number at position (5, 5) is 0. The grid is:\n   ```\n   0, 32, 0, 4, 0\n   0, 0, 0, 4, 0\n   0, 0, 0, 32, 0\n   0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n   16, 32, 0, 0, 0\n   ```\n\n2. **Move 'u' (up)**: Move the number at (5, 5) to (4, 5). The number remains 0. The grid is unchanged.\n\n3. **Move 'l' (left)**: Move the number at (4, 5) to (4, 4). The number remains 0. The grid is unchanged.\n\n4. **Move 'd' (down)**: Move the number at (4, 4) to (5, 4). The number remains 0. The grid is unchanged.\n\n5. **Move 'l' (left)**: Move the number at (5, 4) to (5, 3). The number remains 0. The grid is unchanged.\n\n6. **Move 'l' (left)**: Move the number at (5, 3) to (5, 2). The number remains 0. The grid is unchanged.\n\nSince the number being moved is 0, it does not affect any other numbers in the grid, and no combinations occur. Therefore, the grid remains unchanged after all the moves.\n\nThe final matrix is:\n```\n0, 32, 0, 4, 0\n0, 0, 0, 4, 0\n0, 0, 0, 32, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n16, 32, 0, 0, 0\n```\n\nThe answer is:\n<<<0, 32, 0, 4, 0; 0, 0, 0, 4, 0; 0, 0, 0, 32, 0; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0; 16, 32, 0, 0, 0>>>"
