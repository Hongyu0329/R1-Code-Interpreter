  "question": "In an 4x4 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (4, 4) using the sequence 'urdu':\n0, 0, 4, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 4, 0\n2, 0, 16, 16\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'urdu' for the number located at position (4, 4) in the given 4x4 grid. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   ```\n   0, 0, 4, 0\n   0, 0, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 4, 0\n   2, 0, 16, 16\n   ```\n\n2. **Initial Position of the Number:**\n   - The number at position (4, 4) is 16.\n\n3. **Move 'u' (up):**\n   - Move the number at (4, 4) up to (3, 4).\n   - The number at (3, 4) is 0, so the 16 moves to (3, 4) without combining.\n   - New matrix:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 4, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 4, 16\n     2, 0, 16, 0\n     ```\n\n4. **Move 'r' (right):**\n   - The number at (3, 4) is already at the rightmost position, so it cannot move further right.\n   - The matrix remains unchanged:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 4, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 4, 16\n     2, 0, 16, 0\n     ```\n\n5. **Move 'd' (down):**\n   - Move the number at (3, 4) down to (4, 4).\n   - The number at (4, 4) is 0, so the 16 moves to (4, 4) without combining.\n   - New matrix:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 4, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 4, 0\n     2, 0, 16, 16\n     ```\n\n6. **Move 'u' (up):**\n   - Move the number at (4, 4) up to (3, 4).\n   - The number at (3, 4) is 0, so the 16 moves to (3, 4) without combining.\n   - Final matrix:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 4, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 4, 16\n     2, 0, 16, 0\n     ```\n\nThe final matrix after performing the sequence 'urdu' is:\n<<<0, 0, 4, 0; 0, 0, 0, 0; 0, 0, 4, 16; 2, 0, 16, 0>>>"
