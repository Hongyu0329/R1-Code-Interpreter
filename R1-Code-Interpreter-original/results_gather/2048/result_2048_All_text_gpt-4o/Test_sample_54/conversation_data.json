  "question": "In an 4x4 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (4, 4) using the sequence 'dluu':\n4, 2, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0\n2, 8, 0, 0\n32, 32, 4, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'dluu' for the number in position (4, 4) of the given 4x4 grid. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Grid:**\n   ```\n   4, 2, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 0, 0\n   2, 8, 0, 0\n   32, 32, 4, 0\n   ```\n   The number at position (4, 4) is 0.\n\n2. **Move 'd' (down):**\n   - The number at (4, 4) is 0, so moving down does not change the grid because there is no row below the 4th row. The grid remains the same.\n\n3. **Move 'l' (left):**\n   - The number at (4, 4) is 0. Moving left, it will swap with the number at (4, 3), which is 4. The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     4, 2, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0\n     2, 8, 0, 0\n     32, 32, 0, 4\n     ```\n\n4. **Move 'u' (up):**\n   - The number at (4, 3) is 0. Moving up, it will swap with the number at (3, 3), which is 0. The grid remains the same:\n     ```\n     4, 2, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0\n     2, 8, 0, 0\n     32, 32, 0, 4\n     ```\n\n5. **Move 'u' (up) again:**\n   - The number at (3, 3) is 0. Moving up, it will swap with the number at (2, 3), which is 0. The grid remains the same:\n     ```\n     4, 2, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0\n     2, 8, 0, 0\n     32, 32, 0, 4\n     ```\n\nAfter following the sequence 'dluu', the grid remains unchanged because the number at (4, 4) was 0, and moving 0 around does not affect the grid.\n\nFinal answer:\n<<<4, 2, 0, 0; 0, 0, 0, 0; 2, 8, 0, 0; 32, 32, 0, 4>>>"
