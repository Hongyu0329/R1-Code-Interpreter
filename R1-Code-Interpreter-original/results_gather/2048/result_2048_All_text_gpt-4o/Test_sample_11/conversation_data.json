  "question": "In an 2x2 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (1, 1) using the sequence 'lr':\n4, 4\n8, 8\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the movement of the number in position (1, 1) according to the given sequence 'lr' (left, right). Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   ```\n   4, 4\n   8, 8\n   ```\n   The number in position (1, 1) is 4.\n\n2. **Move 'l' (left):**\n   - The number 4 in position (1, 1) moves left. However, since it is already at the leftmost position, it remains in the same position.\n   - The matrix remains unchanged:\n     ```\n     4, 4\n     8, 8\n     ```\n\n3. **Move 'r' (right):**\n   - The number 4 in position (1, 1) moves right to position (1, 2).\n   - Now, we check if it can combine with the number in position (1, 2), which is also 4.\n   - Since both numbers are the same (4), they combine to form the next power of 2, which is 8.\n   - After combining, the matrix becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 8\n     8, 8\n     ```\n   - The number in position (1, 1) becomes 0 because it has moved and combined with the number in position (1, 2).\n\n4. **Final Matrix:**\n   After executing the sequence 'lr', the final matrix is:\n   ```\n   0, 8\n   8, 8\n   ```\n\nTherefore, the matrix after moving is <<<0, 8; 8, 8>>>."
