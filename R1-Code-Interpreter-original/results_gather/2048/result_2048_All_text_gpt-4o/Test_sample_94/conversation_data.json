    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves for the number located at position (2, 4) in the given 5x5 grid. The initial grid is:\n\n```\n0, 0, 0, 0, 32\n0, 0, 0, 32, 32\n8, 0, 0, 0, 2\n2, 8, 4, 0, 0\n0, 4, 0, 0, 0\n```\n\nThe number at position (2, 4) is 32. We will move this number according to the sequence 'ldldul'. Let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **Move 'l' (left):**\n   - The number 32 at (2, 4) moves left to (2, 3).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 32\n     0, 0, 32, 0, 32\n     8, 0, 0, 0, 2\n     2, 8, 4, 0, 0\n     0, 4, 0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n2. **Move 'd' (down):**\n   - The number 32 at (2, 3) moves down to (3, 3).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 32\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 32\n     8, 0, 0, 32, 2\n     2, 8, 4, 0, 0\n     0, 4, 0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n3. **Move 'l' (left):**\n   - The number 32 at (3, 3) moves left to (3, 2).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 32\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 32\n     8, 0, 32, 0, 2\n     2, 8, 4, 0, 0\n     0, 4, 0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n4. **Move 'd' (down):**\n   - The number 32 at (3, 2) moves down to (4, 2).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 32\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 32\n     8, 0, 0, 0, 2\n     2, 8, 32, 0, 0\n     0, 4, 0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n5. **Move 'u' (up):**\n   - The number 32 at (4, 2) moves up to (3, 2).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 32\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 32\n     8, 0, 32, 0, 2\n     2, 8, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 4, 0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n6. **Move 'l' (left):**\n   - The number 32 at (3, 2) moves left to (3, 1).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 32\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 32\n     8, 32, 0, 0, 2\n     2, 8, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 4, 0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\nAfter following the sequence 'ldldul', the final grid is:\n\n```\n0, 0, 0, 0, 32\n0, 0, 0, 0, 32\n8, 32, 0, 0, 2\n2, 8, 0, 0, 0\n0, 4, 0, 0, 0\n```\n\nTherefore, the matrix after moving is:\n\n<<<0, 0, 0, 0, 32; 0, 0, 0, 0, 32; 8, 32, 0, 0, 2; 2, 8, 0, 0, 0; 0, 4, 0, 0, 0>>>"
