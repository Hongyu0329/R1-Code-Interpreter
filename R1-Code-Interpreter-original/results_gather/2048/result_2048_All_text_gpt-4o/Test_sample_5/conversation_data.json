  "question": "In an 2x2 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (1, 1) using the sequence 'du':\n8, 32\n8, 32\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the movement of the number in position (1, 1) according to the given sequence 'du'. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   ```\n   8, 32\n   8, 32\n   ```\n   The number in position (1, 1) is 8.\n\n2. **First Move (d - down):**\n   - The number 8 at position (1, 1) moves down to position (2, 1).\n   - The matrix now looks like this:\n     ```\n     0, 32\n     8, 32\n     ```\n   - Here, the 8 from (1, 1) has moved to (2, 1), and the original 8 at (2, 1) has been replaced by the moving 8. The original 8 at (2, 1) is now at (1, 1) as 0.\n\n3. **Second Move (u - up):**\n   - The number 8 at position (2, 1) moves up to position (1, 1).\n   - The matrix now looks like this:\n     ```\n     8, 32\n     0, 32\n     ```\n   - Here, the 8 from (2, 1) has moved back to (1, 1), and the position (2, 1) is now 0.\n\n4. **Combining Numbers:**\n   - During these moves, no numbers of the same power of 2 encountered each other, so no combination occurred.\n\n5. **Final Matrix:**\n   - After executing the sequence 'du', the final matrix is:\n     ```\n     8, 32\n     0, 32\n     ```\n\nTherefore, the matrix after moving is <<<8, 32; 0, 32>>>."
