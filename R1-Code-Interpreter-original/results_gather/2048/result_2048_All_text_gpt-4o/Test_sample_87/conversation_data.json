    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves for the number located at position (2, 4) in the grid. The initial grid is:\n\n```\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 2, 8, 0\n0, 0, 0, 8, 0\n32, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 8, 0, 0, 0\n```\n\nThe number at position (2, 4) is 8. We will move this number according to the sequence 'rlulur'. Let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **Move 'r' (right):**\n   - The number 8 at (2, 4) moves to (2, 5).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 2, 0, 8\n     0, 0, 0, 8, 0\n     32, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 8, 0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n2. **Move 'l' (left):**\n   - The number 8 at (2, 5) moves back to (2, 4).\n   - The grid reverts to:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 2, 8, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 8, 0\n     32, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 8, 0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n3. **Move 'u' (up):**\n   - The number 8 at (2, 4) moves to (1, 4).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 2, 8, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     32, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 8, 0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n4. **Move 'l' (left):**\n   - The number 8 at (1, 4) moves to (1, 3).\n   - The number 8 at (1, 3) combines with the existing 8 at (1, 3) to form 16.\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 2, 16, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     32, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 8, 0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n5. **Move 'u' (up):**\n   - The number 16 at (1, 3) moves to (0, 3).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 16, 0\n     0, 0, 2, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     32, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 8, 0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n6. **Move 'r' (right):**\n   - The number 16 at (0, 3) moves to (0, 4).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 16\n     0, 0, 2, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     32, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 8, 0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\nAfter following all the moves, the final grid is:\n\n```\n0, 0, 0, 0, 16\n0, 0, 2, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n32, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 8, 0, 0, 0\n```\n\nTherefore, the matrix after moving is:\n\n<<<0, 0, 0, 0, 16; 0, 0, 2, 0, 0; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0; 32, 0, 0, 0, 0; 0, 8, 0, 0, 0>>>"
