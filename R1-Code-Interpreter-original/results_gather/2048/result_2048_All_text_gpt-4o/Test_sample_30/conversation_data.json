  "question": "In an 3x3 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (2, 1) using the sequence 'duu':\n0, 0, 4\n0, 2, 0\n0, 0, 16\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'duu' for the number located at position (2, 1) in the given 3x3 grid. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Grid:**\n   ```\n   0, 0, 4\n   0, 2, 0\n   0, 0, 16\n   ```\n\n2. **Identify the Starting Position:**\n   - The number at position (2, 1) is 2.\n\n3. **First Move ('d' - down):**\n   - Move the number 2 from position (2, 1) to position (3, 1).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 4\n     0, 0, 0\n     2, 0, 16\n     ```\n\n4. **Second Move ('u' - up):**\n   - Move the number 2 from position (3, 1) to position (2, 1).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 4\n     2, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 16\n     ```\n\n5. **Third Move ('u' - up):**\n   - Move the number 2 from position (2, 1) to position (1, 1).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 2, 4\n     0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 16\n     ```\n\n6. **Final Grid:**\n   - After executing the sequence 'duu', the final grid is:\n     ```\n     0, 2, 4\n     0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 16\n     ```\n\nTherefore, the matrix after moving is:\n\n<<<0, 2, 4; 0, 0, 0; 0, 0, 16>>>"
