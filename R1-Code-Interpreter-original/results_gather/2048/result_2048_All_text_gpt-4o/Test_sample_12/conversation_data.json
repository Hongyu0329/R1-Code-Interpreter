  "question": "In an 2x2 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (1, 2) using the sequence 'uu':\n8, 32\n0, 2\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the movement of the number in position (1, 2) using the sequence 'uu' in the given 2x2 grid. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   ```\n   8, 32\n   0, 2\n   ```\n   Here, the positions are:\n   - (1, 1) = 8\n   - (1, 2) = 32\n   - (2, 1) = 0\n   - (2, 2) = 2\n\n2. **Move Sequence: 'uu'**\n   - The number in position (1, 2) is 32.\n   - The sequence 'uu' means we move the number up twice.\n\n3. **First Move ('u'):**\n   - Move the number 32 from position (1, 2) to position (1, 1).\n   - After this move, the matrix becomes:\n     ```\n     8, 0\n     0, 2\n     ```\n   - The number 32 is now at position (1, 1), and the number 8 is at position (1, 2).\n\n4. **Second Move ('u'):**\n   - Attempt to move the number 32 from position (1, 1) up again.\n   - However, since (1, 1) is already at the top row, moving up again does not change the position.\n   - Therefore, the matrix remains unchanged:\n     ```\n     8, 0\n     0, 2\n     ```\n\n5. **Final Matrix:**\n   - After executing the sequence 'uu', the final matrix is:\n     ```\n     8, 0\n     0, 2\n     ```\n\nThus, the matrix after moving is <<<8, 0; 0, 2>>>."
