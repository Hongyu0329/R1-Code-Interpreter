  "question": "In an 4x4 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32.

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'ddll' for the number located at position (2, 3) in the given 4x4 grid. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Grid:**\n   ```\n   0, 32, 0, 0\n   4, 4, 0, 2\n   16, 0, 0, 32\n   0, 16, 0, 0\n   ```\n   The number at position (2, 3) is 0.\n\n2. **Move 'd' (down):**\n   - The number at (2, 3) moves down to (3, 3).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 32, 0, 0\n     4, 4, 0, 2\n     16, 0, 0, 32\n     0, 16, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n3. **Move 'd' (down):**\n   - The number at (3, 3) moves down to (4, 3).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 32, 0, 0\n     4, 4, 0, 2\n     16, 0, 0, 32\n     0, 16, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n4. **Move 'l' (left):**\n   - The number at (4, 3) moves left to (4, 2).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 32, 0, 0\n     4, 4, 0, 2\n     16, 0, 0, 32\n     0, 16, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n5. **Move 'l' (left):**\n   - The number at (4, 2) moves left to (4, 1).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 32, 0, 0\n     4, 4, 0, 2\n     16, 0, 0, 32\n     0, 16, 0, 0\n     ```\n\nAfter following the sequence 'ddll', the grid remains unchanged because the number at position (2, 3) was initially 0, and moving 0 around does not affect the grid. Therefore, the final grid is:\n\n<<<\n0, 32, 0, 0\n4, 4, 0, 2\n16, 0, 0, 32\n0, 16, 0, 0\n>>>"
