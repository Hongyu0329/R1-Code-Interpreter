  "question": "In an 2x2 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (2, 2) using the sequence 'lu':\n0, 16\n2, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'lu' (left, then up) for the number in position (2, 2) in the given 2x2 grid. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   ```\n   0, 16\n   2, 0\n   ```\n   The number in position (2, 2) is 0.\n\n2. **First Move (l - left):**\n   - We move the number in position (2, 2) to the left, which means it will swap with the number in position (2, 1).\n   - After the move, the matrix becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 16\n     0, 2\n     ```\n\n3. **Second Move (u - up):**\n   - We now move the number in position (2, 1) up, which means it will swap with the number in position (1, 1).\n   - After the move, the matrix becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 16\n     0, 2\n     ```\n   - Since the number in position (2, 1) is 0, moving it up does not change the matrix.\n\n4. **Final Matrix:**\n   - After performing the sequence of moves 'lu', the final matrix is:\n     ```\n     0, 16\n     0, 2\n     ```\n\nTherefore, the matrix after moving is <<<0, 16; 0, 2>>>."
