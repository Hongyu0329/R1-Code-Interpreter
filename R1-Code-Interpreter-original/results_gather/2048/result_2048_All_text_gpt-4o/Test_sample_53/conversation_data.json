  "question": "In an 4x4 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (2, 4) using the sequence 'duuu':\n0, 4, 0, 4\n0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 4, 16, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'duuu' for the number located at position (2, 4) in the given 4x4 grid. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Grid:**\n   ```\n   0, 4, 0, 4\n   0, 0, 0, 0\n   0, 4, 16, 0\n   0, 0, 0, 0\n   ```\n   The number at position (2, 4) is 0.\n\n2. **Move 'd' (down):**\n   - The number at (2, 4) moves down to (3, 4).\n   - Since the number is 0, the grid remains unchanged.\n\n3. **Move 'u' (up):**\n   - The number at (3, 4) moves up to (2, 4).\n   - Again, since the number is 0, the grid remains unchanged.\n\n4. **Move 'u' (up):**\n   - The number at (2, 4) moves up to (1, 4).\n   - The number is still 0, so the grid remains unchanged.\n\n5. **Move 'u' (up):**\n   - The number at (1, 4) moves up to (0, 4).\n   - The number is still 0, so the grid remains unchanged.\n\nThroughout all these moves, the number being moved is 0, which does not affect any other numbers in the grid. Therefore, the grid remains unchanged after the sequence of moves.\n\n**Final Grid:**\n```\n0, 4, 0, 4\n0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 4, 16, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0\n```\n\nThe matrix after moving is: <<<0, 4, 0, 4; 0, 0, 0, 0; 0, 4, 16, 0; 0, 0, 0, 0>>>."
