  "question": "In an 2x2 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (2, 1) using the sequence 'll':\n0, 4\n16, 4\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the movement of the number in position (2, 1) using the sequence 'll' in the given 2x2 grid. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   ```\n   0, 4\n   16, 4\n   ```\n   Here, the positions are:\n   - (1, 1) = 0\n   - (1, 2) = 4\n   - (2, 1) = 16\n   - (2, 2) = 4\n\n2. **Identify the Starting Position:**\n   - The number at position (2, 1) is 16.\n\n3. **First Move ('l'):**\n   - Moving left ('l') from position (2, 1) means moving to position (2, 1) itself because there is no column to the left in a 2x2 grid. Therefore, the position remains the same, and the matrix is unchanged.\n\n4. **Second Move ('l'):**\n   - Again, moving left ('l') from position (2, 1) means moving to position (2, 1) itself. The position remains the same, and the matrix is unchanged.\n\n5. **Final Matrix:**\n   - Since the number 16 at position (2, 1) did not move, the matrix remains unchanged after the sequence 'll'.\n\nTherefore, the final matrix is:\n```\n<<<0, 4; 16, 4>>>\n```"
