  "question": "In an 5x5 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32.

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'rudlrd' for the number located at position (4, 5) in the given 5x5 grid. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Grid:**\n   ```\n   0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n   4, 0, 0, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 0, 0, 2\n   0, 0, 16, 0, 4\n   0, 0, 8, 16, 16\n   ```\n\n2. **Initial Position of the Number:**\n   - The number at position (4, 5) is 4.\n\n3. **Move Sequence: 'rudlrd'**\n\n   - **r (right):** Move the number 4 from (4, 5) to (4, 5) (no change since it's already at the rightmost position).\n\n   - **u (up):** Move the number 4 from (4, 5) to (3, 5). The grid now looks like:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     4, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 2\n     0, 0, 16, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 8, 16, 16\n     ```\n\n   - **d (down):** Move the number 4 from (3, 5) to (4, 5). The grid now looks like:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     4, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 2\n     0, 0, 16, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 8, 16, 16\n     ```\n\n   - **l (left):** Move the number 4 from (4, 5) to (4, 4). The grid now looks like:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     4, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 2\n     0, 0, 16, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 8, 20, 0\n     ```\n\n   - **r (right):** Move the number 4 from (4, 4) to (4, 5). The grid now looks like:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     4, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 2\n     0, 0, 16, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 8, 16, 16\n     ```\n\n   - **d (down):** Move the number 4 from (4, 5) to (5, 5). The grid now looks like:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     4, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 2\n     0, 0, 16, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 8, 16, 16\n     ```\n\n4. **Final Grid:**\n   ```\n   0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n   4, 0, 0, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 0, 0, 2\n   0, 0, 16, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 8, 16, 16\n   ```\n\nThe final matrix after performing the sequence of moves is:\n\n<<<\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n4, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 2\n0, 0, 16, 0, 0\n0, 0, 8, 16, 16\n>>>"
