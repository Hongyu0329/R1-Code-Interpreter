  "question": "In an 5x5 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32.

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'lddud' starting from the number in position (4, 5) in the given 5x5 grid. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Grid:**\n   ```\n   0, 0, 8, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 32, 0, 32\n   0, 32, 0, 0, 4\n   0, 0, 0, 0, 4\n   0, 0, 0, 32, 0\n   ```\n   The number at position (4, 5) is 4.\n\n2. **Move 'l' (left):**\n   - The number 4 at (4, 5) moves left to (4, 4).\n   - New position: (4, 4) with value 4.\n   - Grid after move:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 8, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 32, 0, 32\n     0, 32, 0, 0, 4\n     0, 0, 0, 4, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 32, 0\n     ```\n\n3. **Move 'd' (down):**\n   - The number 4 at (4, 4) moves down to (5, 4).\n   - New position: (5, 4) with value 4.\n   - Grid after move:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 8, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 32, 0, 32\n     0, 32, 0, 0, 4\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 4, 0\n     ```\n\n4. **Move 'd' (down):**\n   - The number 4 at (5, 4) cannot move further down as it is already at the bottom row.\n   - Position remains: (5, 4) with value 4.\n   - Grid remains unchanged:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 8, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 32, 0, 32\n     0, 32, 0, 0, 4\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 4, 0\n     ```\n\n5. **Move 'u' (up):**\n   - The number 4 at (5, 4) moves up to (4, 4).\n   - New position: (4, 4) with value 4.\n   - Grid after move:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 8, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 32, 0, 32\n     0, 32, 0, 0, 4\n     0, 0, 0, 4, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n6. **Move 'd' (down):**\n   - The number 4 at (4, 4) moves down to (5, 4).\n   - New position: (5, 4) with value 4.\n   - Grid after move:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 8, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 32, 0, 32\n     0, 32, 0, 0, 4\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 4, 0\n     ```\n\nThe final grid after executing the sequence 'lddud' is:\n```\n<<<\n0, 0, 8, 0, 0\n0, 0, 32, 0, 32\n0, 32, 0, 0, 4\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 4, 0\n>>>\n```"
