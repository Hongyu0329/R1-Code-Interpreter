  "question": "In an 2x2 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (2, 1) using the sequence 'lr':\n4, 16\n32, 8\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'lr' (left, then right) for the number in position (2, 1) of the given 2x2 grid. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   ```\n   4, 16\n   32, 8\n   ```\n   The number in position (2, 1) is 32.\n\n2. **Move 'l' (left):**\n   - We move the number 32 from position (2, 1) to position (2, 0).\n   - The row becomes: 32, 8\n   - Since 32 and 8 are different numbers, they do not combine.\n   - The matrix after the move 'l' is:\n     ```\n     4, 16\n     32, 8\n     ```\n\n3. **Move 'r' (right):**\n   - We move the number 32 from position (2, 0) to position (2, 1).\n   - The row becomes: 0, 32\n   - The number 8 is now in position (2, 0).\n   - Since 32 and 8 are different numbers, they do not combine.\n   - The matrix after the move 'r' is:\n     ```\n     4, 16\n     8, 32\n     ```\n\nAfter performing the sequence of moves 'lr', the final matrix is:\n```\n<<<4, 16; 8, 32>>>\n```"
