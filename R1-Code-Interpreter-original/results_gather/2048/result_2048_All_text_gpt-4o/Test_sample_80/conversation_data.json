    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'luuddd' for the number located at position (1, 5) in the given 5x5 grid. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Position**: The number at position (1, 5) is 16.\n\n2. **Move 'l' (left)**:\n   - The number 16 moves from (1, 5) to (1, 4).\n   - The grid now looks like this:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 16, 0\n     4, 32, 0, 32, 4\n     2, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 2, 8\n     0, 0, 0, 8, 0\n     ```\n\n3. **Move 'u' (up)**:\n   - The number 16 moves from (1, 4) to (0, 4).\n   - The grid now looks like this:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 16, 0\n     4, 32, 0, 32, 4\n     2, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 2, 8\n     0, 0, 0, 8, 0\n     ```\n\n4. **Move 'u' (up)**:\n   - The number 16 moves from (0, 4) to (-1, 4), which is out of bounds. However, since the grid is 5x5, we assume the number stays at the topmost row (0, 4).\n   - The grid remains unchanged:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 16, 0\n     4, 32, 0, 32, 4\n     2, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 2, 8\n     0, 0, 0, 8, 0\n     ```\n\n5. **Move 'd' (down)**:\n   - The number 16 moves from (0, 4) to (1, 4).\n   - The grid now looks like this:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     4, 32, 0, 32, 16\n     2, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 2, 8\n     0, 0, 0, 8, 0\n     ```\n\n6. **Move 'd' (down)**:\n   - The number 16 moves from (1, 4) to (2, 4).\n   - The grid now looks like this:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     4, 32, 0, 32, 0\n     2, 0, 0, 0, 16\n     0, 0, 0, 2, 8\n     0, 0, 0, 8, 0\n     ```\n\n7. **Move 'd' (down)**:\n   - The number 16 moves from (2, 4) to (3, 4).\n   - The grid now looks like this:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     4, 32, 0, 32, 0\n     2, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 2, 16\n     0, 0, 0, 8, 0\n     ```\n\nAfter following the sequence 'luuddd', the final matrix is:\n\n<<<\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n4, 32, 0, 32, 0\n2, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 2, 16\n0, 0, 0, 8, 0\n>>>"
