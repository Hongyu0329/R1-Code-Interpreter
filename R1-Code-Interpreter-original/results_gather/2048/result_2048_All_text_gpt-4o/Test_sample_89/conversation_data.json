    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves for the number located at position (1, 3) in the given 5x5 grid. The sequence of moves is 'rurlrr'. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Position**: The number at position (1, 3) is 0. The grid is:\n   ```\n   0, 2, 0, 4, 0\n   0, 16, 0, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n   32, 0, 8, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 16, 0, 0\n   ```\n\n2. **Move 'r' (right)**: Move the number at (1, 3) to (1, 4). The grid becomes:\n   ```\n   0, 2, 0, 4, 0\n   0, 16, 0, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n   32, 0, 8, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 16, 0, 0\n   ```\n   Since the number is 0, the grid remains unchanged.\n\n3. **Move 'u' (up)**: Move the number at (1, 4) to (0, 4). The grid becomes:\n   ```\n   0, 2, 0, 4, 0\n   0, 16, 0, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n   32, 0, 8, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 16, 0, 0\n   ```\n   Again, since the number is 0, the grid remains unchanged.\n\n4. **Move 'r' (right)**: Move the number at (0, 4) to (0, 5). The grid becomes:\n   ```\n   0, 2, 0, 4, 0\n   0, 16, 0, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n   32, 0, 8, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 16, 0, 0\n   ```\n   The number is 0, so the grid remains unchanged.\n\n5. **Move 'l' (left)**: Move the number at (0, 5) to (0, 4). The grid becomes:\n   ```\n   0, 2, 0, 4, 0\n   0, 16, 0, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n   32, 0, 8, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 16, 0, 0\n   ```\n   The number is 0, so the grid remains unchanged.\n\n6. **Move 'r' (right)**: Move the number at (0, 4) to (0, 5). The grid becomes:\n   ```\n   0, 2, 0, 4, 0\n   0, 16, 0, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n   32, 0, 8, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 16, 0, 0\n   ```\n   The number is 0, so the grid remains unchanged.\n\n7. **Move 'r' (right)**: Move the number at (0, 5) to (0, 6). The grid becomes:\n   ```\n   0, 2, 0, 4, 0\n   0, 16, 0, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n   32, 0, 8, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 16, 0, 0\n   ```\n   The number is 0, so the grid remains unchanged.\n\nSince the number we are moving is 0, it does not affect the grid at any point. Therefore, the final grid remains the same as the initial grid.\n\nFinal answer:\n<<<\n0, 2, 0, 4, 0\n0, 16, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n32, 0, 8, 0, 0\n0, 0, 16, 0, 0\n>>>"
