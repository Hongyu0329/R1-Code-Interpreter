  "question": "In an 5x5 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (1, 5) using the sequence 'lrruru':\n0, 4, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 32, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 16, 8\n0, 0, 0, 16, 16\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves for the number located at position (1, 5) in the grid. The initial grid is:\n\n```\n0, 4, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 32, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 16, 8\n0, 0, 0, 16, 16\n```\n\nThe number at position (1, 5) is 0. We will follow the sequence 'lrruru' and update the grid accordingly.\n\n1. **Move 'l' (left):**\n   - The number at (1, 5) moves left to (1, 4).\n   - The grid remains unchanged because the number is 0.\n\n2. **Move 'r' (right):**\n   - The number at (1, 4) moves right to (1, 5).\n   - The grid remains unchanged because the number is 0.\n\n3. **Move 'r' (right):**\n   - The number at (1, 5) moves right, but since it's already at the rightmost column, it stays at (1, 5).\n   - The grid remains unchanged because the number is 0.\n\n4. **Move 'u' (up):**\n   - The number at (1, 5) moves up to (0, 5).\n   - The grid remains unchanged because the number is 0.\n\n5. **Move 'r' (right):**\n   - The number at (0, 5) moves right, but since it's already at the rightmost column, it stays at (0, 5).\n   - The grid remains unchanged because the number is 0.\n\n6. **Move 'u' (up):**\n   - The number at (0, 5) moves up, but since it's already at the top row, it stays at (0, 5).\n   - The grid remains unchanged because the number is 0.\n\nSince the number we are moving is 0, and it doesn't interact with any other numbers, the grid remains unchanged throughout the sequence of moves.\n\nFinal matrix:\n\n```\n0, 4, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 32, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 16, 8\n0, 0, 0, 16, 16\n```\n\nTherefore, the matrix after moving is:\n\n<<<0, 4, 0, 0, 0; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0; 0, 32, 0, 0, 0; 0, 0, 0, 16, 8; 0, 0, 0, 16, 16>>>"
