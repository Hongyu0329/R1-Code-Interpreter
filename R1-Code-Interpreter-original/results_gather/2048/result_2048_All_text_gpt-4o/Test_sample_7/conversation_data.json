  "question": "In an 2x2 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (2, 2) using the sequence 'rl':\n16, 4\n32, 8\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the movement of the number in position (2, 2) according to the given sequence 'rl'. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   ```\n   16, 4\n   32, 8\n   ```\n   The number in position (2, 2) is 8.\n\n2. **First Move (r - right):**\n   - The number 8 in position (2, 2) attempts to move right.\n   - Since it is already at the rightmost position of the grid, it cannot move further right.\n   - Therefore, the matrix remains unchanged after this move.\n\n3. **Second Move (l - left):**\n   - The number 8 in position (2, 2) attempts to move left.\n   - It moves to position (2, 1), where the number 32 is currently located.\n   - Since 8 and 32 are different numbers, they do not combine.\n   - The number 8 simply moves to position (2, 1), and the number 32 moves to position (2, 2).\n\n4. **Final Matrix:**\n   After executing the sequence 'rl', the matrix is:\n   ```\n   16, 4\n   8, 32\n   ```\n\nTherefore, the matrix after moving is <<<16, 4; 8, 32>>>."
