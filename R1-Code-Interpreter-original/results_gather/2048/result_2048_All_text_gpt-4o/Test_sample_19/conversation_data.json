  "question": "In an 2x2 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (2, 1) using the sequence 'rr':\n8, 8\n8, 32\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the movement of the number in position (2, 1) using the sequence 'rr' in the given 2x2 grid. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   ```\n   8, 8\n   8, 32\n   ```\n   Here, the positions are:\n   - (1, 1) = 8\n   - (1, 2) = 8\n   - (2, 1) = 8\n   - (2, 2) = 32\n\n2. **Move Sequence: 'rr'**\n   - The sequence 'rr' means we move the number in position (2, 1) to the right twice.\n\n3. **First Move (r):**\n   - Move the number in position (2, 1) to the right.\n   - The number 8 in position (2, 1) moves to position (2, 2).\n   - Now, we have two numbers in position (2, 2): 8 and 32.\n   - Since 8 and 32 are different, they do not combine.\n   - The matrix after the first move:\n     ```\n     8, 8\n     0, 8 + 32\n     ```\n   - Simplifying, the matrix becomes:\n     ```\n     8, 8\n     0, 40\n     ```\n\n4. **Second Move (r):**\n   - Attempt to move the number in position (2, 2) to the right.\n   - However, since the grid is only 2x2, there is no position to the right of (2, 2).\n   - Therefore, the matrix remains unchanged after the second move.\n\n5. **Final Matrix:**\n   - After applying the sequence 'rr', the final matrix is:\n     ```\n     8, 8\n     0, 40\n     ```\n\nThus, the matrix after moving is <<<8, 8; 0, 40>>>."
