  "question": "In an 5x5 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (5, 2) using the sequence 'lrdlr':\n32, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 4, 4, 2, 0\n0, 2, 0, 0, 0\n0, 8, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'lrdlr' for the number located at position (5, 2) in the given 5x5 grid. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Grid:**\n   ```\n   32, 0, 0, 0, 0\n   0, 4, 4, 2, 0\n   0, 2, 0, 0, 0\n   0, 8, 0, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n   ```\n   The number at position (5, 2) is 0.\n\n2. **Move 'l' (left):**\n   - The number at (5, 2) moves left to (5, 1).\n   - Since both positions (5, 1) and (5, 2) are 0, the grid remains unchanged.\n\n3. **Move 'r' (right):**\n   - The number at (5, 1) moves right to (5, 2).\n   - Again, both positions (5, 1) and (5, 2) are 0, so the grid remains unchanged.\n\n4. **Move 'd' (down):**\n   - The number at (5, 2) moves down to (5, 3).\n   - Since (5, 3) is out of bounds, the number remains at (5, 2) and the grid remains unchanged.\n\n5. **Move 'l' (left):**\n   - The number at (5, 2) moves left to (5, 1).\n   - Both positions (5, 1) and (5, 2) are 0, so the grid remains unchanged.\n\n6. **Move 'r' (right):**\n   - The number at (5, 1) moves right to (5, 2).\n   - Again, both positions (5, 1) and (5, 2) are 0, so the grid remains unchanged.\n\nAfter following the sequence 'lrdlr', the grid remains unchanged because the number at (5, 2) is 0 and does not interact with any other numbers. Therefore, the final grid is:\n\n<<<\n32, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 4, 4, 2, 0\n0, 2, 0, 0, 0\n0, 8, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n>>>"
