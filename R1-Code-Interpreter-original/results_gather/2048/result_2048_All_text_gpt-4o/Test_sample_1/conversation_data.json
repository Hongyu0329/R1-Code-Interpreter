  "question": "In an 2x2 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (1, 1) using the sequence 'dr':\n8, 32\n0, 16\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'dr' (down, right) for the number in position (1, 1) in the given 2x2 grid. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   ```\n   8, 32\n   0, 16\n   ```\n\n2. **Move 'd' (down):**\n   - We move the number in position (1, 1) down to position (2, 1).\n   - The number 8 moves from (1, 1) to (2, 1).\n   - The matrix now looks like this:\n     ```\n     0, 32\n     8, 16\n     ```\n\n3. **Move 'r' (right):**\n   - We move the number in position (2, 1) right to position (2, 2).\n   - The number 8 moves from (2, 1) to (2, 2).\n   - At position (2, 2), there is already a 16. Since 8 and 16 are not the same, they do not combine.\n   - The matrix now looks like this:\n     ```\n     0, 32\n     0, 8\n     ```\n\nAfter following the sequence 'dr', the final matrix is:\n```\n<<<0, 32; 0, 8>>>\n```"
