  "question": "In an 4x4 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32.

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'rrll' for the number in position (3, 2) of the given 4x4 grid. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   ```\n   2, 0, 8, 2\n   0, 16, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 8, 4\n   0, 16, 32, 0\n   ```\n\n2. **Identify the Starting Position:**\n   - The number at position (3, 2) is `0`.\n\n3. **Move Sequence:**\n   - **First Move (r):** Move right from (3, 2) to (3, 3).\n     - The number at (3, 2) is `0`, so moving it right doesn't change the grid.\n   - **Second Move (r):** Move right from (3, 3) to (3, 4).\n     - The number at (3, 3) is `8`, and the number at (3, 4) is `4`. Since they are different, they do not combine.\n   - **Third Move (l):** Move left from (3, 4) to (3, 3).\n     - The number at (3, 4) is `4`, and the number at (3, 3) is `8`. Since they are different, they do not combine.\n   - **Fourth Move (l):** Move left from (3, 3) to (3, 2).\n     - The number at (3, 3) is `8`, and the number at (3, 2) is `0`. Since one of them is `0`, they do not combine.\n\n4. **Final Matrix:**\n   - After performing the sequence 'rrll', the matrix remains unchanged because the number at (3, 2) was `0`, and no combinations occurred during the moves.\n\nTherefore, the final matrix is:\n```\n2, 0, 8, 2\n0, 16, 0, 0\n0, 0, 8, 4\n0, 16, 32, 0\n```\n\nThe answer is: <<<2, 0, 8, 2; 0, 16, 0, 0; 0, 0, 8, 4; 0, 16, 32, 0>>>"
