  "question": "In an 5x5 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (1, 5) using the sequence 'rrurl':\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 2, 0, 32\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 16, 0, 0\n16, 2, 0, 0, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves for the number located at position (1, 5) in the grid. The initial grid is:\n\n```\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 2, 0, 32\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 16, 0, 0\n16, 2, 0, 0, 0\n```\n\nThe number at position (1, 5) is 32. We will move this number according to the sequence 'rrurl'. Let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **Move 'r' (right):**\n   - The number 32 at position (1, 5) attempts to move right, but it is already at the rightmost column. Therefore, it remains in the same position.\n   - Grid remains unchanged.\n\n2. **Move 'r' (right):**\n   - Again, the number 32 at position (1, 5) attempts to move right, but it is still at the rightmost column. It remains in the same position.\n   - Grid remains unchanged.\n\n3. **Move 'u' (up):**\n   - The number 32 at position (1, 5) moves up to position (0, 5).\n   - Grid becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 32\n     0, 0, 2, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 16, 0, 0\n     16, 2, 0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n4. **Move 'r' (right):**\n   - The number 32 at position (0, 5) attempts to move right, but it is already at the rightmost column. It remains in the same position.\n   - Grid remains unchanged.\n\n5. **Move 'l' (left):**\n   - The number 32 at position (0, 5) moves left to position (0, 4).\n   - Grid becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 32, 0\n     0, 0, 2, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 16, 0, 0\n     16, 2, 0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\nAfter following the sequence 'rrurl', the final grid is:\n\n```\n<<<\n0, 0, 0, 32, 0\n0, 0, 2, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 16, 0, 0\n16, 2, 0, 0, 0\n>>>\n```"
