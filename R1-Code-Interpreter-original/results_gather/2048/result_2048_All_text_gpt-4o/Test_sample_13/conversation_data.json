  "question": "In an 2x2 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (1, 1) using the sequence 'ud':\n2, 32\n16, 8\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'ud' for the number in position (1, 1) in the given 2x2 grid. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   ```\n   2, 32\n   16, 8\n   ```\n   The number at position (1, 1) is 2.\n\n2. **First Move ('u'):**\n   - The move 'u' indicates moving up. However, since the number 2 is already at the top row, it cannot move up any further. Therefore, the matrix remains unchanged after this move.\n   - Matrix after 'u':\n     ```\n     2, 32\n     16, 8\n     ```\n\n3. **Second Move ('d'):**\n   - The move 'd' indicates moving down. The number 2 at position (1, 1) will move down to position (2, 1).\n   - After moving down, the number 2 at position (2, 1) will encounter the number 16. Since 2 and 16 are not the same power of 2, they do not combine, and the numbers remain unchanged.\n   - Matrix after 'd':\n     ```\n     0, 32\n     2, 8\n     ```\n\n4. **Final Matrix:**\n   - After executing the sequence 'ud', the final matrix is:\n     ```\n     0, 32\n     2, 8\n     ```\n\nTherefore, the matrix after moving the number in position (1, 1) using the sequence 'ud' is:\n\n<<<0, 32; 2, 8>>>"
