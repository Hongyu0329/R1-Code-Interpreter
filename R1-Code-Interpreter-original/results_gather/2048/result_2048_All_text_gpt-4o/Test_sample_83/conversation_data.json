When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32.

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'lullll' starting from the position (3, 3) in the given 5x5 grid. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Position**: The number at position (3, 3) is 0. The grid is:\n   ```\n   0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n   8, 2, 4, 0, 0\n   8, 0, 0, 0, 4\n   0, 4, 0, 16, 0\n   0, 0, 0, 0, 4\n   ```\n\n2. **Move 'u' (up)**: Move the number at (3, 3) up to (2, 3). The number at (2, 3) is 0, so nothing changes. The grid remains:\n   ```\n   0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n   8, 2, 4, 0, 0\n   8, 0, 0, 0, 4\n   0, 4, 0, 16, 0\n   0, 0, 0, 0, 4\n   ```\n\n3. **Move 'l' (left)**: Move the number at (2, 3) left to (2, 2). The number at (2, 2) is 0, so nothing changes. The grid remains:\n   ```\n   0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n   8, 2, 4, 0, 0\n   8, 0, 0, 0, 4\n   0, 4, 0, 16, 0\n   0, 0, 0, 0, 4\n   ```\n\n4. **Move 'l' (left)**: Move the number at (2, 2) left to (2, 1). The number at (2, 1) is 0, so nothing changes. The grid remains:\n   ```\n   0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n   8, 2, 4, 0, 0\n   8, 0, 0, 0, 4\n   0, 4, 0, 16, 0\n   0, 0, 0, 0, 4\n   ```\n\n5. **Move 'l' (left)**: Move the number at (2, 1) left to (2, 0). The number at (2, 0) is 8. Since 0 cannot combine with 8, nothing changes. The grid remains:\n   ```\n   0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n   8, 2, 4, 0, 0\n   8, 0, 0, 0, 4\n   0, 4, 0, 16, 0\n   0, 0, 0, 0, 4\n   ```\n\n6. **Move 'l' (left)**: The number at (2, 0) cannot move further left as it is already at the leftmost column. The grid remains unchanged:\n   ```\n   0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n   8, 2, 4, 0, 0\n   8, 0, 0, 0, 4\n   0, 4, 0, 16, 0\n   0, 0, 0, 0, 4\n   ```\n\nAfter executing the sequence 'lullll', the grid remains unchanged because the initial number at (3, 3) was 0, and moving 0 around does not affect the grid. Therefore, the final matrix is:\n\n<<<\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n8, 2, 4, 0, 0\n8, 0, 0, 0, 4\n0, 4, 0, 16, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 4\n>>>"
