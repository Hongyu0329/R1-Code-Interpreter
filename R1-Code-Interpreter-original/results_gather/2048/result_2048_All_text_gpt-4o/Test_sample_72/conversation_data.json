    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'lluud' for the number located at position (4, 3) in the given 5x5 grid. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Position**: The number at position (4, 3) is 0. The grid is:\n   ```\n   0, 0, 4, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 32, 0, 32\n   0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n   8, 0, 0, 0, 16\n   0, 32, 0, 0, 4\n   ```\n\n2. **First Move (l - left)**: Move the number at (4, 3) to (4, 2). The grid becomes:\n   ```\n   0, 0, 4, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 32, 0, 32\n   0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n   8, 0, 0, 0, 16\n   0, 32, 0, 0, 4\n   ```\n   Since the number is 0, the grid remains unchanged.\n\n3. **Second Move (l - left)**: Move the number at (4, 2) to (4, 1). The grid becomes:\n   ```\n   0, 0, 4, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 32, 0, 32\n   0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n   8, 0, 0, 0, 16\n   0, 32, 0, 0, 4\n   ```\n   Again, since the number is 0, the grid remains unchanged.\n\n4. **Third Move (u - up)**: Move the number at (4, 1) to (3, 1). The grid becomes:\n   ```\n   0, 0, 4, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 32, 0, 32\n   0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n   8, 0, 0, 0, 16\n   0, 32, 0, 0, 4\n   ```\n   The number is still 0, so the grid remains unchanged.\n\n5. **Fourth Move (u - up)**: Move the number at (3, 1) to (2, 1). The grid becomes:\n   ```\n   0, 0, 4, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 32, 0, 32\n   0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n   8, 0, 0, 0, 16\n   0, 32, 0, 0, 4\n   ```\n   The number is still 0, so the grid remains unchanged.\n\n6. **Fifth Move (d - down)**: Move the number at (2, 1) to (3, 1). The grid becomes:\n   ```\n   0, 0, 4, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 32, 0, 32\n   0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n   8, 0, 0, 0, 16\n   0, 32, 0, 0, 4\n   ```\n   The number is still 0, so the grid remains unchanged.\n\nSince the number we are moving is 0, it does not affect the grid during any of the moves. Therefore, the final grid remains the same as the initial grid.\n\nFinal matrix:\n<<<\n0, 0, 4, 0, 0\n0, 0, 32, 0, 32\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n8, 0, 0, 0, 16\n0, 32, 0, 0, 4\n>>>"
