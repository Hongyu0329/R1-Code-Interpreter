  "question": "In an 5x5 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (3, 2) using the sequence 'rdlluu':\n0, 0, 0, 0, 2\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 8, 0, 32\n0, 0, 0, 0, 4\n4, 32, 0, 0, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves for the number located at position (3, 2) in the given 5x5 grid. The initial grid is:\n\n```\n0, 0, 0, 0, 2\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 8, 0, 32\n0, 0, 0, 0, 4\n4, 32, 0, 0, 0\n```\n\nThe number at position (3, 2) is 8. We will move this number according to the sequence 'rdlluu'. Let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **r (right):** Move the number 8 from (3, 2) to (3, 3).\n   - Grid after move:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 2\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 8, 32\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 4\n     4, 32, 0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n2. **d (down):** Move the number 8 from (3, 3) to (4, 3).\n   - Grid after move:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 2\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 32\n     0, 0, 0, 8, 4\n     4, 32, 0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n3. **l (left):** Move the number 8 from (4, 3) to (4, 2).\n   - Grid after move:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 2\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 32\n     0, 0, 8, 0, 4\n     4, 32, 0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n4. **l (left):** Move the number 8 from (4, 2) to (4, 1). The number 8 encounters 32, which is a different number, so it remains unchanged.\n   - Grid after move:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 2\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 32\n     0, 8, 0, 0, 4\n     4, 32, 0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n5. **u (up):** Move the number 8 from (4, 1) to (3, 1).\n   - Grid after move:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 2\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 8, 0, 0, 32\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 4\n     4, 32, 0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n6. **u (up):** Move the number 8 from (3, 1) to (2, 1).\n   - Grid after move:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 2\n     0, 8, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 32\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 4\n     4, 32, 0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\nAfter following the sequence 'rdlluu', the final grid is:\n\n```\n0, 0, 0, 0, 2\n0, 8, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 32\n0, 0, 0, 0, 4\n4, 32, 0, 0, 0\n```\n\nTherefore, the matrix after moving is:\n\n<<<0, 0, 0, 0, 2; 0, 8, 0, 0, 0; 0, 0, 0, 0, 32; 0, 0, 0, 0, 4; 4, 32, 0, 0, 0>>>"
