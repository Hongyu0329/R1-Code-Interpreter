When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (2, 1) using the sequence 'll':\n16, 4\n4, 16\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the movement of the numbers in the 2x2 grid according to the rules of the '2048' game. The initial grid is:\n\n```\n16, 4\n4, 16\n```\n\nThe task is to move the number in position (2, 1) using the sequence 'll'. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Position**: The number at position (2, 1) is 4. The grid looks like this:\n   ```\n   (1, 1) 16, (1, 2) 4\n   (2, 1) 4,  (2, 2) 16\n   ```\n\n2. **First Move (l)**: Move left.\n   - The number 4 at position (2, 1) moves left. However, since it is already at the leftmost position in its row, it cannot move further left. Therefore, the grid remains unchanged after this move:\n     ```\n     16, 4\n     4, 16\n     ```\n\n3. **Second Move (l)**: Move left again.\n   - Similar to the first move, the number 4 at position (2, 1) is already at the leftmost position in its row, so it cannot move further left. The grid remains unchanged after this move as well:\n     ```\n     16, 4\n     4, 16\n     ```\n\nSince the number at position (2, 1) cannot move left due to being at the boundary of the grid, the grid remains unchanged after applying the sequence 'll'.\n\nTherefore, the final matrix after the moves is:\n\n<<<16, 4; 4, 16>>>"
