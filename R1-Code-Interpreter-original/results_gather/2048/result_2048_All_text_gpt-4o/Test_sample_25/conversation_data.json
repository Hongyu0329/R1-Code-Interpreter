  "question": "In an 3x3 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (2, 2) using the sequence 'uul':\n32, 8, 32\n0, 32, 16\n0, 0, 2\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'uul' for the number in position (2, 2) of the given 3x3 grid. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Grid:**\n   ```\n   32, 8, 32\n   0, 32, 16\n   0, 0, 2\n   ```\n   The number at position (2, 2) is 32.\n\n2. **First Move (u - move up):**\n   - The number 32 at position (2, 2) moves up to position (1, 2).\n   - The number at position (1, 2) is 8, which is different from 32, so they do not combine.\n   - The grid after the first move:\n     ```\n     32, 32, 32\n     0, 0, 16\n     0, 0, 2\n     ```\n\n3. **Second Move (u - move up):**\n   - The number 32 at position (1, 2) moves up to position (0, 2).\n   - The number at position (0, 2) is 32, which is the same, so they combine to form 64.\n   - The grid after the second move:\n     ```\n     32, 8, 64\n     0, 0, 16\n     0, 0, 2\n     ```\n\n4. **Third Move (l - move left):**\n   - The number 64 at position (0, 2) moves left to position (0, 1).\n   - The number at position (0, 1) is 8, which is different from 64, so they do not combine.\n   - The grid after the third move:\n     ```\n     32, 64, 8\n     0, 0, 16\n     0, 0, 2\n     ```\n\nAfter following the sequence 'uul', the final grid is:\n\n<<<32, 64, 8; 0, 0, 16; 0, 0, 2>>>"
