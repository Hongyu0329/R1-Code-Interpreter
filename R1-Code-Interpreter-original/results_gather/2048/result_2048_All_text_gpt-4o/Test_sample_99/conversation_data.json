  "question": "In an 5x5 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32.

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves for the number located at position (3, 1) in the grid. The initial grid is:\n\n```\n0, 0, 0, 0, 8\n0, 0, 32, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n16, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 32, 8\n```\n\nThe number at position (3, 1) is 16. We will move this number according to the sequence 'rlrrlr'. Let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **Initial Position**: (3, 1) with value 16.\n\n2. **Move 'r' (right)**: \n   - New position: (3, 2)\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 8\n     0, 0, 32, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 16, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 32, 8\n     ```\n\n3. **Move 'l' (left)**:\n   - New position: (3, 1)\n   - The grid reverts to:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 8\n     0, 0, 32, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     16, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 32, 8\n     ```\n\n4. **Move 'r' (right)**:\n   - New position: (3, 2)\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 8\n     0, 0, 32, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 16, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 32, 8\n     ```\n\n5. **Move 'r' (right)**:\n   - New position: (3, 3)\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 8\n     0, 0, 32, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 16, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 32, 8\n     ```\n\n6. **Move 'l' (left)**:\n   - New position: (3, 2)\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 8\n     0, 0, 32, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 16, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 32, 8\n     ```\n\n7. **Move 'r' (right)**:\n   - New position: (3, 3)\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 8\n     0, 0, 32, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 16, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 32, 8\n     ```\n\nAfter following the sequence 'rlrrlr', the final position of the number 16 is at (3, 3). The final grid is:\n\n```\n0, 0, 0, 0, 8\n0, 0, 32, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 16, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 32, 8\n```\n\nTherefore, the matrix after moving is:\n\n<<<0, 0, 0, 0, 8; 0, 0, 32, 0, 0; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0; 0, 0, 16, 0, 0; 0, 0, 0, 32, 8>>>"
