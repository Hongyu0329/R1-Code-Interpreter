  "question": "In an 4x4 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32.

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'dull' for the number located at position (3, 2) in the given 4x4 grid. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Grid:**\n   ```\n   2, 2, 0, 0\n   0, 16, 0, 0\n   4, 8, 2, 0\n   0, 32, 0, 0\n   ```\n   The number at position (3, 2) is 8.\n\n2. **Move 'd' (down):**\n   - The number 8 at position (3, 2) moves down to position (4, 2).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     2, 2, 0, 0\n     0, 16, 0, 0\n     4, 0, 2, 0\n     0, 8, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n3. **Move 'u' (up):**\n   - The number 8 at position (4, 2) moves up to position (3, 2).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     2, 2, 0, 0\n     0, 16, 0, 0\n     4, 8, 2, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n4. **Move 'l' (left):**\n   - The number 8 at position (3, 2) moves left to position (3, 1).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     2, 2, 0, 0\n     0, 16, 0, 0\n     12, 0, 2, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n5. **Move 'l' (left) again:**\n   - The number 12 at position (3, 1) moves left to position (3, 0).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     2, 2, 0, 0\n     0, 16, 0, 0\n     12, 0, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\nAfter following the sequence 'dull', the final grid is:\n```\n<<<\n2, 2, 0, 0\n0, 16, 0, 0\n12, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0\n>>>\n```"
