  "question": "In an 3x3 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (1, 2) using the sequence 'rdl':\n0, 4, 0\n8, 0, 2\n8, 2, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'rdl' for the number in position (1, 2) of the given 3x3 grid. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Grid:**\n   ```\n   0, 4, 0\n   8, 0, 2\n   8, 2, 0\n   ```\n   The number in position (1, 2) is '0'. However, since '0' is not a power of 2, it doesn't affect the grid. We need to focus on the number in position (2, 3), which is '2', as it is the only number that can move according to the sequence.\n\n2. **Move 'r' (right):**\n   - The number '2' at position (2, 3) moves to the right. However, since it is already at the rightmost column, it cannot move further right. Therefore, the grid remains unchanged after this move.\n\n3. **Move 'd' (down):**\n   - The number '2' at position (2, 3) moves down to position (3, 3). The grid now looks like this:\n     ```\n     0, 4, 0\n     8, 0, 0\n     8, 2, 2\n     ```\n\n4. **Move 'l' (left):**\n   - The number '2' at position (3, 3) moves left to position (3, 2). The grid now looks like this:\n     ```\n     0, 4, 0\n     8, 0, 0\n     8, 4, 0\n     ```\n   - Here, the '2' at position (3, 3) combines with the '2' at position (3, 2) to form '4', which is the next power of 2.\n\nAfter following the sequence 'rdl', the final grid is:\n```\n0, 4, 0\n8, 0, 0\n8, 4, 0\n```\n\nTherefore, the matrix after moving is:\n<<<0, 4, 0; 8, 0, 0; 8, 4, 0>>>"
