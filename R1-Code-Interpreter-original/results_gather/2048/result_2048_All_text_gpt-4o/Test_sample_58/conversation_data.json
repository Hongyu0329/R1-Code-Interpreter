  "question": "In an 4x4 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (2, 2) using the sequence 'rrud':\n0, 4, 8, 0\n0, 2, 0, 0\n0, 32, 2, 0\n2, 4, 0, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'rrud' for the number located at position (2, 2) in the given 4x4 grid. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   ```\n   0, 4, 8, 0\n   0, 2, 0, 0\n   0, 32, 2, 0\n   2, 4, 0, 0\n   ```\n\n2. **Initial Position of the Number:**\n   - The number at position (2, 2) is 2.\n\n3. **Move Sequence:**\n\n   - **First Move (r - right):**\n     - Move the number 2 from (2, 2) to (2, 3).\n     - The matrix becomes:\n       ```\n       0, 4, 8, 0\n       0, 0, 2, 0\n       0, 32, 2, 0\n       2, 4, 0, 0\n       ```\n\n   - **Second Move (r - right):**\n     - Move the number 2 from (2, 3) to (2, 4).\n     - The matrix becomes:\n       ```\n       0, 4, 8, 0\n       0, 0, 0, 2\n       0, 32, 2, 0\n       2, 4, 0, 0\n       ```\n\n   - **Third Move (u - up):**\n     - Move the number 2 from (2, 4) to (1, 4).\n     - The matrix becomes:\n       ```\n       0, 4, 8, 0\n       0, 0, 0, 0\n       0, 32, 2, 0\n       2, 4, 0, 2\n       ```\n\n   - **Fourth Move (d - down):**\n     - Move the number 2 from (1, 4) to (2, 4).\n     - The matrix becomes:\n       ```\n       0, 4, 8, 0\n       0, 0, 0, 2\n       0, 32, 2, 0\n       2, 4, 0, 0\n       ```\n\n4. **Final Matrix:**\n   - After performing all the moves, the final matrix is:\n     ```\n     0, 4, 8, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 2\n     0, 32, 2, 0\n     2, 4, 0, 0\n     ```\n\nTherefore, the matrix after moving is:\n\n<<<0, 4, 8, 0; 0, 0, 0, 2; 0, 32, 2, 0; 2, 4, 0, 0>>>"
