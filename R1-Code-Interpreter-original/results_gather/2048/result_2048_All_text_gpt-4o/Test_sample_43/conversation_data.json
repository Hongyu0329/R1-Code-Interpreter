  "question": "In an 4x4 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (2, 2) using the sequence 'urdr':\n0, 16, 32, 0\n0, 32, 8, 0\n0, 8, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 8\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'urdr' for the number located at position (2, 2) in the given 4x4 grid. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   ```\n   0, 16, 32, 0\n   0, 32, 8, 0\n   0, 8, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 0, 8\n   ```\n\n2. **Identify the Starting Position:**\n   - The number at position (2, 2) is 32.\n\n3. **Move Sequence: 'urdr'**\n\n   - **Move 'u' (up):**\n     - Move the number 32 from position (2, 2) to position (1, 2).\n     - The number at (1, 2) is 16, which is not the same power of 2 as 32, so they do not combine.\n     - New matrix:\n       ```\n       0, 32, 32, 0\n       0, 0, 8, 0\n       0, 8, 0, 0\n       0, 0, 0, 8\n       ```\n\n   - **Move 'r' (right):**\n     - Move the number 32 from position (1, 2) to position (1, 3).\n     - The number at (1, 3) is 32, which is the same power of 2, so they combine to form 64.\n     - New matrix:\n       ```\n       0, 16, 0, 64\n       0, 0, 8, 0\n       0, 8, 0, 0\n       0, 0, 0, 8\n       ```\n\n   - **Move 'd' (down):**\n     - Move the number 64 from position (1, 3) to position (2, 3).\n     - The number at (2, 3) is 8, which is not the same power of 2 as 64, so they do not combine.\n     - New matrix:\n       ```\n       0, 16, 0, 0\n       0, 0, 8, 64\n       0, 8, 0, 0\n       0, 0, 0, 8\n       ```\n\n   - **Move 'r' (right):**\n     - Move the number 64 from position (2, 3) to position (2, 4).\n     - The number at (2, 4) is 0, so they do not combine.\n     - New matrix:\n       ```\n       0, 16, 0, 0\n       0, 0, 8, 64\n       0, 8, 0, 0\n       0, 0, 0, 8\n       ```\n\n4. **Final Matrix:**\n   - After performing all the moves, the final matrix is:\n     ```\n     0, 16, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 8, 64\n     0, 8, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 8\n     ```\n\nTherefore, the matrix after moving is:\n\n<<<0, 16, 0, 0; 0, 0, 8, 64; 0, 8, 0, 0; 0, 0, 0, 8>>>"
