  "question": "In an 3x3 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (2, 3) using the sequence 'ddu':\n0, 2, 0\n0, 32, 0\n0, 8, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'ddu' for the number located at position (2, 3) in the given 3x3 grid. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   ```\n   0, 2, 0\n   0, 32, 0\n   0, 8, 0\n   ```\n   The number at position (2, 3) is 32.\n\n2. **First Move ('d'):**\n   - Move the number at position (2, 3) down one step to position (3, 3).\n   - The matrix becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 2, 0\n     0, 0, 0\n     0, 8, 32\n     ```\n\n3. **Second Move ('d'):**\n   - Attempt to move the number at position (3, 3) down one step. However, since it is already at the bottom row, it cannot move further down. Therefore, the matrix remains unchanged:\n     ```\n     0, 2, 0\n     0, 0, 0\n     0, 8, 32\n     ```\n\n4. **Third Move ('u'):**\n   - Move the number at position (3, 3) up one step to position (2, 3).\n   - The matrix becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 2, 0\n     0, 0, 32\n     0, 8, 0\n     ```\n\n5. **Final Matrix:**\n   After executing the sequence 'ddu', the final matrix is:\n   ```\n   0, 2, 0\n   0, 0, 32\n   0, 8, 0\n   ```\n\nTherefore, the matrix after moving is <<<0, 2, 0; 0, 0, 32; 0, 8, 0>>>."
