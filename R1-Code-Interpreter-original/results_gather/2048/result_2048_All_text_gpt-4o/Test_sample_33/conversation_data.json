  "question": "In an 3x3 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (2, 3) using the sequence 'lll':\n8, 0, 4\n32, 16, 16\n0, 0, 2\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'lll' for the number in position (2, 3) of the given 3x3 grid. Let's analyze the steps one by one:\n\n1. **Initial Grid:**\n   ```\n   8, 0, 4\n   32, 16, 16\n   0, 0, 2\n   ```\n\n2. **Identify the Starting Position:**\n   - The number at position (2, 3) is 16.\n\n3. **First Move (l - left):**\n   - Move the number 16 from position (2, 3) to (2, 2).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     8, 0, 4\n     32, 16, 0\n     0, 0, 2\n     ```\n\n4. **Second Move (l - left):**\n   - Move the number 16 from position (2, 2) to (2, 1).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     8, 0, 4\n     32, 16, 0\n     0, 2, 0\n     ```\n\n5. **Third Move (l - left):**\n   - Move the number 16 from position (2, 1) to (2, 0).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     8, 0, 4\n     32, 16, 0\n     2, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n6. **Final Grid:**\n   - After performing all the moves, the final grid is:\n     ```\n     8, 0, 4\n     32, 16, 0\n     2, 0, 0\n     ```\n\nTherefore, the matrix after moving is:\n\n<<<8, 0, 4; 32, 16, 0; 2, 0, 0>>>"
