    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves for the number located at position (5, 2) in the grid, which is 32. The sequence of moves is 'lrrur'. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Position**: The number 32 is at position (5, 2).\n\n2. **Move 'l' (left)**:\n   - The number 32 moves from (5, 2) to (5, 1).\n   - The grid now looks like this:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 8, 32, 0\n     8, 0, 0, 32, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     4, 4, 0, 32, 4\n     32, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n3. **Move 'r' (right)**:\n   - The number 32 moves from (5, 1) to (5, 2).\n   - The grid remains unchanged because it returns to its original position:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 8, 32, 0\n     8, 0, 0, 32, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     4, 4, 0, 32, 4\n     0, 32, 0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n4. **Move 'r' (right)**:\n   - The number 32 moves from (5, 2) to (5, 3).\n   - The grid now looks like this:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 8, 32, 0\n     8, 0, 0, 32, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     4, 4, 0, 32, 4\n     0, 0, 32, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n5. **Move 'u' (up)**:\n   - The number 32 moves from (5, 3) to (4, 3).\n   - The grid now looks like this:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 8, 32, 0\n     8, 0, 0, 32, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     4, 4, 32, 32, 4\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n6. **Move 'r' (right)**:\n   - The number 32 at (4, 3) moves to (4, 4) and encounters another 32.\n   - They combine to form 64.\n   - The grid now looks like this:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 8, 32, 0\n     8, 0, 0, 32, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     4, 4, 0, 64, 4\n     0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\nThe final matrix after performing all the moves is:\n<<<0, 0, 8, 32, 0; 8, 0, 0, 32, 0; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0; 4, 4, 0, 64, 4; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0>>>"
