  "question": "In an 3x3 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32.

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'uur' for the number in position (3, 2) in the given 3x3 grid. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Grid:**\n   ```\n   0, 0, 0\n   0, 8, 0\n   32, 32, 0\n   ```\n\n2. **Identify the Starting Position:**\n   - The number at position (3, 2) is 32.\n\n3. **First Move ('u'):**\n   - Move the number at (3, 2) up one step to position (2, 2).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 0\n     0, 32, 0\n     32, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n4. **Second Move ('u'):**\n   - Move the number at (2, 2) up one step to position (1, 2).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 32, 0\n     0, 0, 0\n     32, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n5. **Third Move ('r'):**\n   - Move the number at (1, 2) right one step to position (1, 3).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 32\n     0, 0, 0\n     32, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n6. **Final Grid:**\n   - After performing the sequence 'uur', the final grid is:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 32\n     0, 0, 0\n     32, 0, 0\n     ```\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0, 0, 32; 0, 0, 0; 32, 0, 0>>>"
