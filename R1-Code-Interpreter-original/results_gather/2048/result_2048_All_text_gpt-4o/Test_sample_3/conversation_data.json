  "question": "In an 2x2 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (2, 2) using the sequence 'ur':\n32, 2\n32, 4\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'ur' (up, then right) for the number in position (2, 2) of the given 2x2 grid. Let's analyze the steps carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   ```\n   32, 2\n   32, 4\n   ```\n   The number at position (2, 2) is 4.\n\n2. **First Move (u - up):**\n   - We move the number at position (2, 2) up to position (1, 2).\n   - The number at position (1, 2) is 2.\n   - Since 4 and 2 are different powers of 2, they do not combine.\n   - The matrix after this move:\n     ```\n     32, 4\n     32, 0\n     ```\n   - The number 4 has moved to position (1, 2), and position (2, 2) is now 0.\n\n3. **Second Move (r - right):**\n   - We move the number at position (1, 2) right to position (1, 1).\n   - The number at position (1, 1) is 32.\n   - Since 4 and 32 are different powers of 2, they do not combine.\n   - The matrix after this move:\n     ```\n     32, 4\n     32, 0\n     ```\n   - The number 4 remains at position (1, 2) because it cannot move further right in a 2x2 grid.\n\nAfter executing the sequence 'ur', the final matrix is:\n```\n<<<32, 4; 32, 0>>>\n```"
