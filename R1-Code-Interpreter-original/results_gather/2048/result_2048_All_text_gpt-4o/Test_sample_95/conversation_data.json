  "question": "In an 5x5 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (3, 3) using the sequence 'rrdluu':\n4, 32, 0, 16, 0\n16, 0, 0, 16, 0\n16, 4, 16, 0, 0\n0, 0, 32, 16, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves for the number located at position (3, 3) in the given 5x5 grid. The sequence is 'rrdluu', which stands for right, right, down, left, up, up. We will track the position of the number and any combinations that occur during these moves.\n\n1. **Initial Position**: The number at position (3, 3) is 16.\n\n2. **Move 1 (r - right)**: \n   - Current position: (3, 3) with value 16.\n   - Move right to (3, 4). The value at (3, 4) is 0.\n   - The number 16 moves to (3, 4) without any combination.\n\n3. **Move 2 (r - right)**:\n   - Current position: (3, 4) with value 16.\n   - Move right to (3, 5). The value at (3, 5) is 0.\n   - The number 16 moves to (3, 5) without any combination.\n\n4. **Move 3 (d - down)**:\n   - Current position: (3, 5) with value 16.\n   - Move down to (4, 5). The value at (4, 5) is 0.\n   - The number 16 moves to (4, 5) without any combination.\n\n5. **Move 4 (l - left)**:\n   - Current position: (4, 5) with value 16.\n   - Move left to (4, 4). The value at (4, 4) is 0.\n   - The number 16 moves to (4, 4) without any combination.\n\n6. **Move 5 (u - up)**:\n   - Current position: (4, 4) with value 16.\n   - Move up to (3, 4). The value at (3, 4) is 0.\n   - The number 16 moves to (3, 4) without any combination.\n\n7. **Move 6 (u - up)**:\n   - Current position: (3, 4) with value 16.\n   - Move up to (2, 4). The value at (2, 4) is 16.\n   - The number 16 combines with the 16 at (2, 4) to form 32.\n   - The new value at (2, 4) is 32.\n\nAfter performing all the moves, the final matrix is:\n\n```\n4, 32, 0, 16, 0\n16, 0, 0, 32, 0\n16, 4, 16, 0, 0\n0, 0, 32, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n```\n\nThe matrix after moving is: <<<4, 32, 0, 16, 0; 16, 0, 0, 32, 0; 16, 4, 16, 0, 0; 0, 0, 32, 0, 0; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0>>>."
