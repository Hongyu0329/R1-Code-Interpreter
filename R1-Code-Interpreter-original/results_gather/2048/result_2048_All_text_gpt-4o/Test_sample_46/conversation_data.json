  "question": "In an 4x4 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32.

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'uuul' for the number located at position (4, 1) in the given 4x4 grid. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Grid:**\n   ```\n   0, 0, 16, 0\n   2, 8, 0, 0\n   0, 4, 4, 0\n   0, 0, 0, 0\n   ```\n   The number at position (4, 1) is 0.\n\n2. **First Move ('u'):**\n   - Move the number at (4, 1) up to (3, 1).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 16, 0\n     2, 8, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 4, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n3. **Second Move ('u'):**\n   - Move the number at (3, 1) up to (2, 1).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 16, 0\n     2, 8, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 4, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n4. **Third Move ('u'):**\n   - Move the number at (2, 1) up to (1, 1).\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 16, 0\n     2, 8, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 4, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\n5. **Fourth Move ('l'):**\n   - Move the number at (1, 1) left to (1, 1). Since the number is 0, the grid remains unchanged.\n   - The grid becomes:\n     ```\n     0, 0, 16, 0\n     2, 8, 0, 0\n     0, 0, 4, 0\n     0, 0, 0, 0\n     ```\n\nAfter following the sequence 'uuul', the grid remains unchanged because the number at (4, 1) was 0, and moving 0 does not affect the grid.\n\nFinal answer:\n<<<0, 0, 16, 0; 2, 8, 0, 0; 0, 0, 4, 0; 0, 0, 0, 0>>>"
