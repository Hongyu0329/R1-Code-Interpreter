  "question": "In an 5x5 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32. When they encounter a different number, they remain unchanged.\nu: represents moving up one step\nd: represents moving down one step\nl: represents moving left one step\nr: represents moving right one step\n\nNow, in the following matrix, move the number in position (4, 3) using the sequence 'ddddd':\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 16\n32, 8, 0, 0, 0\n4, 0, 0, 16, 0\n8, 0, 0, 0, 0\n\nWhat is the matrix after moving?\nReturn your answer with format <<<matrix>>>.",

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves and apply the rules of the '2048' game to the grid. Let's analyze the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   ```\n   0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n   0, 0, 0, 0, 16\n   32, 8, 0, 0, 0\n   4, 0, 0, 16, 0\n   8, 0, 0, 0, 0\n   ```\n\n2. **Identify the Starting Position:**\n   - The number at position (4, 3) is `0`.\n\n3. **Sequence of Moves: 'ddddd' (down five times):**\n   - **First Move (d):** Move the number at (4, 3) down to (5, 3).\n     - The number at (5, 3) is `0`, so the number remains `0`.\n   - **Second Move (d):** Attempt to move the number at (5, 3) down, but since it's already at the bottom row, it cannot move further.\n   - **Third Move (d):** Same as the second move, no change.\n   - **Fourth Move (d):** Same as the second move, no change.\n   - **Fifth Move (d):** Same as the second move, no change.\n\n4. **Final Matrix:**\n   - Since the number at (4, 3) was `0` and it moved to (5, 3) which is also `0`, and further moves were not possible, the matrix remains unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the matrix after the sequence of moves is:\n\n```\n<<<\n0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n0, 0, 0, 0, 16\n32, 8, 0, 0, 0\n4, 0, 0, 16, 0\n8, 0, 0, 0, 0\n>>>\n```"
