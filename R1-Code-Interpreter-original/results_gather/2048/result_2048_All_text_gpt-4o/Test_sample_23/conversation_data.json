  "question": "In an 3x3 grid, there are several squares containing powers of 2. We define the '2048' game: The numbers in the grid can move in any direction. When they encounter a number that is the same power of 2, they can combine to form a larger number that is the next power of 2. For example: 2 meets 2 -> 4; 4 meets 4 -> 8; 16 meets 16 -> 32.

    "To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of moves 'rud' (right, up, down) for the number located at position (2, 2) in the given 3x3 grid. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Initial Matrix:**\n   ```\n   0, 0, 0\n   16, 16, 0\n   16, 0, 0\n   ```\n\n2. **Initial Position of the Number:**\n   - The number at position (2, 2) is 0.\n\n3. **Move Sequence:**\n   - **r (right):** Move the number at (2, 2) to the right.\n     - The number at (2, 2) is 0, so moving it to the right to (2, 3) doesn't change the grid.\n     - The grid remains:\n       ```\n       0, 0, 0\n       16, 16, 0\n       16, 0, 0\n       ```\n\n   - **u (up):** Move the number at (2, 3) up.\n     - The number at (2, 3) is 0, so moving it up to (1, 3) doesn't change the grid.\n     - The grid remains:\n       ```\n       0, 0, 0\n       16, 16, 0\n       16, 0, 0\n       ```\n\n   - **d (down):** Move the number at (1, 3) down.\n     - The number at (1, 3) is 0, so moving it down to (2, 3) doesn't change the grid.\n     - The grid remains:\n       ```\n       0, 0, 0\n       16, 16, 0\n       16, 0, 0\n       ```\n\n4. **Final Matrix:**\n   - After executing the sequence 'rud', the matrix remains unchanged because the number at (2, 2) was 0, and moving 0 around does not affect the grid.\n\nTherefore, the final matrix is:\n```\n<<<0, 0, 0\n16, 16, 0\n16, 0, 0>>>\n```"
