    "To solve this problem, we need to fill the 7x7 grid such that each row and each column contains exactly one of each letter from 'a' to 'g', and all cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Minor Diagonal**: The minor diagonal consists of the following cells:\n   - (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0)\n\n2. **Determine the Letter for the Minor Diagonal**: We need to choose a letter that can be placed in all these positions without violating the row and column constraints. We will try to find a letter that is not already present in any of these rows or columns.\n\n3. **Fill the Grid**: Once the minor diagonal letter is chosen, fill the rest of the grid ensuring each row and column contains all letters from 'a' to 'g'.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_puzzle(grid):\n    import copy\n    \n    # Helper function to check if placing a letter is valid\n    def is_valid(grid, row, col, letter):\n        # Check row\n        if letter in grid[row]:\n            return False\n        # Check column\n        for r in range(7):\n            if grid[r][col] == letter:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    # Try to find a suitable letter for the minor diagonal\n    def find_minor_diagonal_letter(grid):\n        for letter in 'abcdefg':\n            valid = True\n            for i in range(7):\n                if not is_valid(grid, i, 6-i, letter):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if valid:\n                return letter\n        return None\n\n    # Fill the grid\n    def fill_grid(grid, minor_diagonal_letter):\n        for i in range(7):\n            for j in range(7):\n                if grid[i][j] == '':\n                    for letter in 'abcdefg':\n                        if is_valid(grid, i, j, letter):\n                            grid[i][j] = letter\n                            break\n        return grid\n\n    # Copy the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    grid_copy = copy.deepcopy(grid)\n    \n    # Find the letter for the minor diagonal\n    minor_diagonal_letter = find_minor_diagonal_letter(grid_copy)\n    \n    # Fill the minor diagonal\n    for i in range(7):\n        grid_copy[i][6-i] = minor_diagonal_letter\n    \n    # Fill the rest of the grid\n    filled_grid = fill_grid(grid_copy, minor_diagonal_letter)\n    \n    return filled_grid\n\n# Initial grid\ngrid = [\n    ['g', '', 'c', 'a', 'd', '', 'e'],\n    ['', 'c', '', '', '', '', ''],\n    ['', '', '', '', '', 'g', ''],\n    ['', '', 'b', '', 'g', 'f', ''],\n    ['d', '', '', '', 'f', '', 'a'],\n    ['b', '', 'g', 'f', '', 'a', ''],\n    ['', '', '', '', 'a', 'd', '']\n]\n\n# Solve the puzzle\nsolution = solve_puzzle(grid)\n\n# Print the solution\nfor row in solution:\n    print(','.join(row))\n```\n\nThis code will fill the grid according to the given constraints and print the solution.

    "The error indicates that there is a `NoneType` in the list, which means that the grid was not completely filled with valid letters.
