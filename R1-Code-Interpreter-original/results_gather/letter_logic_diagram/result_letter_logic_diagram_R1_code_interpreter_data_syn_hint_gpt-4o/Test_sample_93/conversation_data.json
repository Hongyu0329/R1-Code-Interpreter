    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill in the missing letters in the 7x7 grid while adhering to the given constraints. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the constraints:**\n   - Each row must contain all letters from 'a' to 'g' exactly once.\n   - Each column must contain all letters from 'a' to 'g' exactly once.\n   - The minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) must contain the same letter.\n\n2. **Analyze the given grid:**\n   - We have some pre-filled cells, and we need to fill in the blanks.\n   - The minor diagonal cells are at positions (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), and (6,0).\n\n3. **Determine the letter for the minor diagonal:**\n   - Check the pre-filled cells on the minor diagonal to determine the common letter.\n\n4. **Fill in the grid:**\n   - Use the constraints to fill in the missing letters, ensuring each row and column contains all letters from 'a' to 'g'.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_puzzle(grid):\n    # Determine the letter for the minor diagonal\n    minor_diagonal_letter = None\n    for i in range(7):\n        if grid[i][6-i] != '':\n            minor_diagonal_letter = grid[i][6-i]\n            break\n    \n    # Fill the minor diagonal with the determined letter\n    for i in range(7):\n        grid[i][6-i] = minor_diagonal_letter\n    \n    # Function to find missing letters in a list\n    def find_missing_letters(lst):\n        return list(set('abcdefg') - set(lst))\n    \n    # Fill the grid\n    for i in range(7):\n        # Fill rows\n        missing_in_row = find_missing_letters(grid[i])\n        for j in range(7):\n            if grid[i][j] == '':\n                grid[i][j] = missing_in_row.pop()\n    \n    # Transpose the grid to work with columns\n    transposed_grid = list(map(list, zip(*grid)))\n    \n    for j in range(7):\n        # Fill columns\n        missing_in_col = find_missing_letters(transposed_grid[j])\n        for i in range(7):\n            if transposed_grid[j][i] == '':\n                transposed_grid[j][i] = missing_in_col.pop()\n    \n    # Transpose back to original grid\n    solved_grid = list(map(list, zip(*transposed_grid)))\n    \n    # Format the output\n    result = '\\n'.join([','.join(row) for row in solved_grid])\n    return result\n\n# Initial grid\ngrid = [\n    ['g', 'b', '', '', '', 'a', 'c'],\n    ['b', 'e', 'f', 'd', 'a', 'c', 'g'],\n    ['', '', '', '', 'c', 'g', ''],\n    ['f', '', '', '', '', '', 'e'],\n    ['', 'a', 'c', '', 'b', 'e', 'f'],\n    ['a', '', 'g', 'b', 'e', 'f', ''],\n    ['c', 'g', 'b', '', '', 'd', '']\n]\n\n# Solve the puzzle\nprint(solve_puzzle(grid))\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the solution.",
