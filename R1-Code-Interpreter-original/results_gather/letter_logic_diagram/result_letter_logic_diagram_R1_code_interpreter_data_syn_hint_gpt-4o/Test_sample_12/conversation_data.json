    "To solve this problem, we need to fill the 7x7 grid such that each row and each column contains exactly one of each letter from 'a' to 'g', and all cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Minor Diagonal**: The minor diagonal consists of the following positions in the grid:\n   - (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0)\n\n2. **Determine the Letter for the Minor Diagonal**: We need to choose a letter that can be placed in all these positions without violating the row and column constraints.
