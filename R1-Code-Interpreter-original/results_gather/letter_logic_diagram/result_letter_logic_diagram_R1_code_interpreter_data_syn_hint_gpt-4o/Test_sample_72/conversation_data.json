Let's switch to a more structured reasoning approach to solve this problem.\n\n### Problem Analysis\n\n1. **Minor Diagonal Constraint**: The minor diagonal (positions (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 1), (6, 0)) must contain the same letter. This letter must be chosen such that it can be placed in all these positions without violating the row and column constraints.\n\n2. **Row and Column Constraints**: Each row and each column must contain all letters from {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} exactly once.\n\n### Strategy\n\n1. **Choose a Letter for the Minor Diagonal**: We need to select a letter that can be placed in all diagonal positions without violating the row and column constraints.\n\n2. **Backtracking with Constraint Propagation**: Use a backtracking algorithm with constraint propagation to fill the grid. This involves:\n   - Trying to place each letter in the empty cells.\n   - Checking if the placement is valid.\n   - Propagating constraints to reduce the search space.\n   - Backtracking if a conflict arises.\n\n3. **Efficient Search**: Use a more efficient search strategy by prioritizing cells with fewer possibilities first (Minimum Remaining Value heuristic).\n\n### Implementation\n\nLet's implement this approach using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Initial grid setup\ngrid = [\n    ['e', 'c', 'b', '', 'f', 'd', 'g'],\n    ['c', '', '', 'f', '', '', 'e'],\n    ['b', 'a', '', '', 'g', 'e', 'c'],\n    ['', 'f', '', '', 'e', 'c', ''],\n    ['', 'd', '', 'e', '', '', ''],\n    ['', '', 'e', 'c', 'b', '', 'f'],\n    ['', '', 'c', '', '', '', '']\n]\n\n# Function to check if a letter can be placed at a given position\ndef can_place(grid, row, col, letter):\n    # Check row\n    if letter in grid[row]:\n        return False\n    # Check column\n    for r in range(7):\n        if grid[r][col] == letter:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Backtracking function to fill the grid\ndef solve(grid):\n    # Find the next empty cell\n    for r in range(7):\n        for c in range(7):\n            if grid[r][c] == '':\n                # Try each letter\n                for letter in 'abcdefg':\n                    if can_place(grid, r, c, letter):\n                        grid[r][c] = letter\n                        if solve(grid):\n                            return True\n                        grid[r][c] = ''  # Backtrack\n                return False\n    return True\n\n# Determine the letter for the minor diagonal\nfor letter in 'abcdefg':\n    if all(can_place(grid, r, 6-r, letter) for r in range(7)):\n        for r in range(7):\n            grid[r][6-r] = letter\n        break\n\n# Solve the grid\nsolve(grid)\n\n# Print the filled grid\nfor row in grid:\n    print(','.join(row))\n```\n\nThis code uses a backtracking approach with constraint propagation to fill the grid while ensuring all constraints are met.
