  "question": "Given a 7x7 grid of letters {a..g}, some cells are pre-filled. Fill the rest so that:\n1) Each row has exactly one of each letter {a..g}.\n2) Each column has exactly one of each letter {a..g}.\n3) All cells on the minor diagonal (top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter.\n\nHere is the puzzle (each row on its own line, cells separated by commas, empty cells blank):\n\nd,e,c,a,f,,g\n,c,,,b,g,\nc,a,f,,,d,e\na,,,g,d,e,c\nf,,g,d,e,c,a\nb,g,,,c,,f\ng,d,e,c,,f,\n\nReturn the answer with the format:\n<<<\nrow1\nrow2\n...

    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill in the missing letters in the 7x7 grid while adhering to the given constraints. Let's break down the problem:\n\n1. Each row must contain each letter from 'a' to 'g' exactly once.\n2. Each column must contain each letter from 'a' to 'g' exactly once.\n3. All cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) must contain the same letter.\n\nGiven the constraints, we can use a backtracking algorithm to fill in the grid. The backtracking algorithm will try to fill each empty cell with a letter from 'a' to 'g', ensuring that the row and column constraints are satisfied. Additionally, we need to ensure that the minor diagonal constraint is met.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_valid(grid, row, col, char):\n    # Check if char is not in the current row\n    if char in grid[row]:\n        return False\n    # Check if char is not in the current column\n    for r in range(7):\n        if grid[r][col] == char:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef solve(grid, minor_diagonal_char):\n    for row in range(7):\n        for col in range(7):\n            if grid[row][col] == '':\n                for char in 'abcdefg':\n                    if is_valid(grid, row, col, char):\n                        # Check minor diagonal constraint\n                        if row + col == 6 and char != minor_diagonal_char:\n                            continue\n                        grid[row][col] = char\n                        if solve(grid, minor_diagonal_char):\n                            return True\n                        grid[row][col] = ''\n                return False\n    return True\n\n# Initial grid setup\ngrid = [\n    ['d', 'e', 'c', 'a', 'f', '', 'g'],\n    ['', 'c', '', '', 'b', 'g', ''],\n    ['c', 'a', 'f', '', '', 'd', 'e'],\n    ['a', '', '', 'g', 'd', 'e', 'c'],\n    ['f', '', 'g', 'd', 'e', 'c', 'a'],\n    ['b', 'g', '', '', 'c', '', 'f'],\n    ['g', 'd', 'e', 'c', '', 'f', '']\n]\n\n# Determine the minor diagonal character\nminor_diagonal_char = grid[0][6]  # The top-right corner\n\n# Solve the puzzle\nsolve(grid, minor_diagonal_char)\n\n# Print the solution\nfor row in grid:\n    print(','.join(row))\n```\n\nThis code will fill in the grid according to the constraints and print the completed grid.
