    "To solve this problem, we need to fill the 7x7 grid with letters from 'a' to 'g' such that each row and each column contains exactly one of each letter, and all cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan to solve the puzzle:\n\n1. **Identify the Minor Diagonal**: The minor diagonal consists of the cells (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), and (6,0). All these cells must contain the same letter.\n\n2. **Determine the Diagonal Letter**: Since the minor diagonal must contain the same letter, we need to check which letter can fit into all these positions without violating the row and column constraints.\n\n3. **Fill the Grid**: Use a backtracking algorithm to fill the grid. Start by filling the minor diagonal with the chosen letter, then fill the rest of the grid ensuring each row and column contains all letters from 'a' to 'g'.\n\n4. **Output the Solution**: Once the grid is filled correctly, format the output as specified.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef solve_puzzle(grid):\n    from itertools import permutations\n\n    def is_valid(grid):\n        for i in range(7):\n            if len(set(grid[i])) != 7 or len(set(row[i] for row in grid)) != 7:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    def fill_grid(grid, diag_letter):\n        # Fill the minor diagonal with the chosen letter\n        for i in range(7):\n            grid[i][6-i] = diag_letter\n\n        # Try to fill the rest of the grid\n        for perm in permutations('abcdefg'):\n            for i in range(7):\n                if grid[i].count('') == 0:\n                    continue\n                for j in range(7):\n                    if grid[i][j] == '':\n                        grid[i][j] = perm[j]\n            if is_valid(grid):\n                return grid\n            # Reset the grid for the next permutation\n            for i in range(7):\n                for j in range(7):\n                    if grid[i][j] not in 'abcdefg':\n                        grid[i][j] = ''\n        return None\n\n    # Initial grid setup\n    grid = [\n        ['b', '', 'e', '', '', '', ''],\n        ['', '', '', '', 'f', '', ''],\n        ['', '', '', 'f', 'g', '', ''],\n        ['c', '', 'f', 'g', 'b', 'd', ''],\n        ['', 'f', '', 'b', 'd', '', 'c'],\n        ['', 'g', '', 'd', '', '', 'a'],\n        ['g', '', '', '', '', '', 'f']\n    ]\n\n    # Try each letter for the minor diagonal\n    for letter in 'abcdefg':\n        if fill_grid(grid, letter):\n            break\n\n    # Format the output\n    result = '\\n'.join(','.join(row) for row in grid)\n    return f\"<<<\\n{result}\\n>>>\"\n\n# Solve the puzzle and print the result\nprint(solve_puzzle([]))\n```\n\nThis code attempts to fill the grid by trying each letter for the minor diagonal and using permutations to fill the rest of the grid.

    "The current solution employs advanced techniques like forward checking and arc consistency, which are appropriate for solving constraint satisfaction problems. However, the solution still seems to be incorrect. To further refine the solution, ensure that the implementation of these techniques is correct and that all constraints are being respected. Consider adding more detailed debugging outputs to trace the process and identify where the solution might be going wrong. Additionally, verify that the minor diagonal is filled with the same letter and that this choice does not conflict with any pre-filled cells."
