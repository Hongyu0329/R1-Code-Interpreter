    "To solve this problem, we need to fill in the missing letters in the 7x7 grid while adhering to the given constraints. Here's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Identify the Constraints:**\n   - Each row must contain each letter from 'a' to 'g' exactly once.\n   - Each column must contain each letter from 'a' to 'g' exactly once.\n   - All cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) must contain the same letter.\n\n2. **Analyze the Grid:**\n   - We have a 7x7 grid with some pre-filled letters.\n   - We need to determine which letter should be on the minor diagonal and ensure it appears in each row and column only once.\n\n3. **Choose the Minor Diagonal Letter:**\n   - The minor diagonal runs from the top-right to the bottom-left. We need to choose a letter that can fit into each of these positions without violating the row and column constraints.\n\n4. **Fill the Grid:**\n   - For each empty cell, determine the possible letters that can be placed there based on the row and column constraints.\n   - Use backtracking to try different combinations and find a valid solution.\n\n5. **Output the Solution:**\n   - Once the grid is filled, format the output as specified.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef solve_puzzle(grid):\n    from itertools import permutations\n\n    # Helper function to check if a letter can be placed at a given position\n    def can_place(letter, row, col):\n        return letter not in grid[row] and all(grid[r][col] != letter for r in range(7))\n\n    # Try to fill the grid using backtracking\n    def backtrack(row, col):\n        if row == 7:\n            return True\n        if col == 7:\n            return backtrack(row + 1, 0)\n        if grid[row][col] != '':\n            return backtrack(row, col + 1)\n\n        for letter in 'abcdefg':\n            if can_place(letter, row, col):\n                grid[row][col] = letter\n                if backtrack(row, col + 1):\n                    return True\n                grid[row][col] = ''\n\n        return False\n\n    # Fill the minor diagonal with the same letter\n    for letter in 'abcdefg':\n        if all(can_place(letter, i, 6 - i) for i in range(7)):\n            for i in range(7):\n                grid[i][6 - i] = letter\n            if backtrack(0, 0):\n                break\n            for i in range(7):\n                grid[i][6 - i] = ''\n\n    # Format the output\n    return '\\n'.join(','.join(row) for row in grid)\n\n# Initial grid setup\ngrid = [\n    ['c', '', '', '', 'b', '', ''],\n    ['', 'f', 'e', 'b', '', 'g', ''],\n    ['', '', 'b', '', '', '', ''],\n    ['', 'b', 'a', '', 'c', 'd', 'f'],\n    ['b', 'a', '', '', '', '', ''],\n    ['', 'g', '', '', 'f', 'e', ''],\n    ['', 'c', '', 'f', '', '', '']\n]\n\n# Solve the puzzle\nsolution = solve_puzzle(grid)\nprint(\"<<<\")\nprint(solution)\nprint(\">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code uses backtracking to fill the grid while respecting the constraints.
