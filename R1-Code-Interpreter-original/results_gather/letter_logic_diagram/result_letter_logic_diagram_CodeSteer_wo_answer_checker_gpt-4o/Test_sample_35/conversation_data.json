    "To solve this problem, we need to fill the 7x7 grid with letters from 'a' to 'g' such that each row and each column contains each letter exactly once, and all cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. **Identify the Minor Diagonal**: The minor diagonal consists of cells (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), and (6,0). We need to ensure these cells contain the same letter.\n\n2. **Fill the Grid**: We will use a backtracking approach to fill the grid. This involves:\n   - Trying to place each letter in each empty cell.\n   - Checking if placing a letter violates any of the constraints (row, column, and minor diagonal).\n   - If a placement is valid, we proceed to the next cell.\n   - If we reach a dead end, we backtrack and try a different letter.\n\n3. **Output the Solution**: Once the grid is filled correctly, we will print the grid in the specified format.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_valid(grid, row, col, letter):\n    # Check if the letter is already in the row or column\n    for i in range(7):\n        if grid[row][i] == letter or grid[i][col] == letter:\n            return False\n    # Check if the letter is consistent with the minor diagonal constraint\n    if row + col == 6:\n        for i in range(7):\n            if grid[i][6-i] != '' and grid[i][6-i] != letter:\n                return False\n    return True\n\ndef solve(grid, row=0, col=0):\n    if row == 7:\n        return True\n    if col == 7:\n        return solve(grid, row + 1, 0)\n    if grid[row][col] != '':\n        return solve(grid, row, col + 1)\n    \n    for letter in 'abcdefg':\n        if is_valid(grid, row, col, letter):\n            grid[row][col] = letter\n            if solve(grid, row, col + 1):\n                return True\n            grid[row][col] = ''\n    return False\n\ndef print_grid(grid):\n    for row in grid:\n        print(','.join(row))\n\n# Initial grid setup\ngrid = [\n    ['', 'a', '', 'g', 'b', '', ''],\n    ['a', 'd', 'g', '', '', 'c', ''],\n    ['d', '', '', 'e', 'c', '', 'a'],\n    ['', 'b', 'e', '', 'f', 'a', 'd'],\n    ['b', 'e', 'c', '', '', 'd', 'g'],\n    ['', '', '', '', 'd', 'g', ''],\n    ['', '', 'a', '', '', '', '']\n]\n\n# Solve the puzzle\nsolve(grid)\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(\"<<<\")\nprint_grid(grid)\nprint(\">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will fill the grid according to the given constraints and print the solution in the specified format."
