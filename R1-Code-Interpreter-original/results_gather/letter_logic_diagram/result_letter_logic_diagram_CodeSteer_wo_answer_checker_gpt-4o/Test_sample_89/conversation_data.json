    "To solve this problem, we need to fill the 7x7 grid such that each row and each column contains exactly one of each letter from 'a' to 'g', and all cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter.\n\nHere's a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. **Identify the Minor Diagonal**: The minor diagonal consists of the cells (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), and (6,0).\n\n2. **Determine the Letter for the Minor Diagonal**: Since all cells on the minor diagonal must contain the same letter, we need to choose a letter that is not already present in any of these positions.\n\n3. **Fill the Grid**: \n   - For each row, identify the missing letters.\n   - For each column, ensure that each letter appears exactly once.\n   - Ensure that the chosen letter for the minor diagonal is placed correctly.\n\n4. **Output the Completed Grid**: Format the output as specified.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan in Python:\n\n```python\ndef solve_puzzle():\n    # Initial grid with empty cells as None\n    grid = [\n        [None, None, 'a', 'g', None, 'b', 'c'],\n        [None, 'a', None, None, None, 'c', 'd'],\n        ['a', 'g', 'e', 'b', None, None, None],\n        ['g', None, 'b', None, 'd', 'f', 'a'],\n        ['e', 'b', None, None, 'f', None, 'g'],\n        [None, None, 'd', 'f', 'a', None, None],\n        ['d', 'f', 'a', 'g', 'e', 'b', None]\n    ]\n\n    # Determine the letter for the minor diagonal\n    # Check which letter is not present in the minor diagonal positions\n    minor_diagonal_positions = [(0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 1), (6, 0)]\n    letters = set('abcdefg')\n    for r, c in minor_diagonal_positions:\n        if grid[r][c] in letters:\n            letters.remove(grid[r][c])\n    minor_diagonal_letter = letters.pop()\n\n    # Fill the minor diagonal with the chosen letter\n    for r, c in minor_diagonal_positions:\n        grid[r][c] = minor_diagonal_letter\n\n    # Fill the rest of the grid\n    for r in range(7):\n        row_letters = set('abcdefg') - set(grid[r])\n        for c in range(7):\n            if grid[r][c] is None:\n                # Find a letter that is not in the current column\n                col_letters = set(grid[i][c] for i in range(7))\n                possible_letters = row_letters - col_letters\n                chosen_letter = possible_letters.pop()\n                grid[r][c] = chosen_letter\n                row_letters.remove(chosen_letter)\n\n    # Format the output\n    result = '\\n'.join(','.join(row) for row in grid)\n    print(f\"<<<\\n{result}\\n>>>\")\n\nsolve_puzzle()\n```\n\nThis code will fill the grid according to the rules and print the completed grid in the specified format.",
