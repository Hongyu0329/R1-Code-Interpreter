    "To solve this problem, we need to fill the 7x7 grid with letters from 'a' to 'g' such that each row and each column contains each letter exactly once, and all cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. **Identify the Minor Diagonal**: The minor diagonal consists of cells (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), and (6,0). We need to ensure these cells contain the same letter.\n\n2. **Determine the Letter for the Minor Diagonal**: Since the minor diagonal must contain the same letter, we can choose a letter that is not already present in any of these positions.\n\n3. **Fill the Grid**: Use a backtracking algorithm to fill the grid. This involves:\n   - Trying to place each letter in each empty cell.\n   - Ensuring that each row and column contains each letter exactly once.\n   - Ensuring the minor diagonal constraint is satisfied.\n\n4. **Output the Solution**: Once the grid is filled correctly, format the output as specified.\n\nNow, let's implement the solution in Python:\n\n```python\ndef solve_puzzle(grid):\n    from itertools import permutations\n\n    # Helper function to check if the grid is valid\n    def is_valid(grid):\n        for i in range(7):\n            if len(set(grid[i])) != 7:  # Check rows\n                return False\n            if len(set(grid[j][i] for j in range(7))) != 7:  # Check columns\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    # Find the letter for the minor diagonal\n    minor_diagonal_indices = [(0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 1), (6, 0)]\n    used_letters = set(grid[i][j] for i, j in minor_diagonal_indices if grid[i][j] != '')\n    all_letters = set('abcdefg')\n    minor_diagonal_letter = (all_letters - used_letters).pop()\n\n    # Fill the minor diagonal with the chosen letter\n    for i, j in minor_diagonal_indices:\n        grid[i][j] = minor_diagonal_letter\n\n    # Try to fill the rest of the grid\n    def backtrack(row=0, col=0):\n        if row == 7:\n            return is_valid(grid)\n        if col == 7:\n            return backtrack(row + 1, 0)\n        if grid[row][col] != '':\n            return backtrack(row, col + 1)\n\n        for letter in 'abcdefg':\n            grid[row][col] = letter\n            if is_valid(grid) and backtrack(row, col + 1):\n                return True\n            grid[row][col] = ''\n\n        return False\n\n    # Start backtracking from the first cell\n    backtrack()\n\n    # Format the output\n    return '\\n'.join(','.join(row) for row in grid)\n\n# Initial grid setup\ngrid = [\n    ['', 'g', '', '', 'c', 'e', 'a'],\n    ['g', '', 'b', '', '', '', ''],\n    ['', '', 'c', 'e', '', '', ''],\n    ['b', '', 'e', 'a', '', 'g', 'd'],\n    ['', '', '', '', 'g', '', 'b'],\n    ['', '', '', '', 'd', 'b', ''],\n    ['', '', '', 'd', 'b', '', '']\n]\n\n# Solve the puzzle\nsolution = solve_puzzle(grid)\nprint(\"<<<\")\nprint(solution)\nprint(\">>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will fill the grid according to the given constraints and print the solution in the specified format.",
