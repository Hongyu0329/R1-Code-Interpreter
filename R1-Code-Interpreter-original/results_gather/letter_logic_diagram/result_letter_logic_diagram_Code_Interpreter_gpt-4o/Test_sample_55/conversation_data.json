Let's start by analyzing the grid and then proceed to fill in the missing letters.\n\nHere's the initial grid with the given letters:\n\n```\na, g, _, _, f, _, b\n_, d, _, _, e, _, a\nd, _, f, e, _, a, g\nc, f, e, b, a, g, _\n_, _, b, _, g, d, c\ne, b, a, g, d, c, _\nb, _, g, d, c, f, e\n```\n\nThe constraints are:\n1. Each row must contain exactly one of each letter {a, b, c, d, e, f, g}.\n2. Each column must contain exactly one of each letter {a, b, c, d, e, f, g}.\n3.
