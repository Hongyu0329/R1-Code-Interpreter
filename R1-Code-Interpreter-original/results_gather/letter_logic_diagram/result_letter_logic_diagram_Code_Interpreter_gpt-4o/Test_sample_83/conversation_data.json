    "\nassistant > To solve this puzzle, we need to fill in the missing letters in the 7x7 grid while adhering to the given constraints. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Each row must contain each letter from {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} exactly once.\n2. Each column must contain each letter from {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} exactly once.\n3.
