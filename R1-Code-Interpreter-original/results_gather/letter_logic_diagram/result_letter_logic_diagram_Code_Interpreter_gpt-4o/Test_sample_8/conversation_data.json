    "\nassistant > To solve this puzzle, we need to fill in the missing letters in the 7x7 grid while adhering to the given constraints. Let's start by analyzing the grid and then fill in the missing letters.\n\nHere's the initial grid with the given letters:\n\n```\ne, f, _, d, _, a, c\n_, b, _, _, a, _, e\n_, d, g, a, _, e, _\nd, g, a, c, e, f, b\ng, a, _, e, f, b, d\n_, c, _, _, _, d, g\n_, e, f, b, d, g, a\n```\n\nThe constraints are:\n1. Each row must contain exactly one of each letter {a, b, c, d, e, f, g}.\n2. Each column must contain exactly one of each letter {a, b, c, d, e, f, g}.\n3.
