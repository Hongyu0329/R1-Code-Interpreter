    "\nassistant > To solve this puzzle, we need to fill in the missing letters in the 7x7 grid while adhering to the given constraints. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Each row must contain exactly one of each letter from {a, b, c, d, e, f, g}.\n2. Each column must also contain exactly one of each letter from {a, b, c, d, e, f, g}.\n3. All cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) must contain the same letter.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the given grid and then fill in the missing letters accordingly.
