    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's analyze the problem:\n   - We need to fill a 7x7 grid with letters a-g\n   - Each row and column must contain each letter exactly once\n   - The minor diagonal (top-right to bottom-left) must have the same letter\n   - We have several pre-filled cells that must be respected\n\n2) This is essentially a constraint satisfaction problem.
