    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's analyze the problem:\n   - We need to fill a 7x7 grid with letters a-g\n   - Each row and column must contain each letter exactly once\n   - The minor diagonal (top-right to bottom-left) must have the same letter\n   - We have several pre-filled cells that constrain the solution\n\n2) This is essentially a constraint satisfaction problem.

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then generate the code to run, finnaly provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \n**Many tasks require highly complex code with symbolic computing and efficient searching.**\n**You need to generate more complex code with more efficient searching, optimization, iteration, heuristic methods.**\nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Given a 7x7 grid of letters {a..g}, some cells are pre-filled. Fill the rest so that:\n1) Each row has exactly one of each letter {a..g}.\n2) Each column has exactly one of each letter {a..g}.\n3) All cells on the minor diagonal (top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter.\n\nHere is the puzzle (each row on its own line, cells separated by commas, empty cells blank):\n\n,c,,,b,,\nc,f,,,a,,\n,,b,a,e,,c\n,b,,,,,f\n,,e,g,c,f,\n,,g,,,d,\ne,,,,,b,\n\nReturn the answer with the format:\n<<<\nrow1\nrow2\n...  (7 rows total)\n>>>\n\nwhere each row has 7 letters separated by commas.",
