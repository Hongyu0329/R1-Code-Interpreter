    "After multiple attempts and getting \"No solution exists\", let me analyze the puzzle constraints more carefully:\n\n1. Looking at the minor diagonal (top-right to bottom-left):\n   - Row 1, Col 6: 'e'\n   - Row 2, Col 5: empty\n   - Row 3, Col 4: empty\n   - Row 4, Col 3: 'b'\n   - Row 5, Col 2: empty\n   - Row 6, Col 1: empty\n   - Row 7, Col 0: empty\n\nI notice a critical error in our previous approaches. We assumed all minor diagonal positions should be 'g', but this is impossible because:\n1. Position (1,6) is pre-filled with 'e'\n2. Position (4,3) is pre-filled with 'b'\n\nThis means the original puzzle has conflicting constraints:\n- We can't have the same letter on all minor diagonal positions because some positions are already filled with different letters ('e' and 'b').\n- These pre-filled values cannot be changed according to the rules.\n\nTherefore, the puzzle as stated has no valid solution because the constraints are contradictory:\n1. The requirement \"All cells on the minor diagonal contain the same letter\" cannot be satisfied\n2. While maintaining the pre-filled values which include different letters ('e' and 'b') on the minor diagonal\n\n<<<\nNO SOLUTION EXISTS - The puzzle constraints are contradictory. The minor diagonal cannot contain the same letter while respecting pre-filled values 'e' and 'b' on the diagonal.\n>>>"
