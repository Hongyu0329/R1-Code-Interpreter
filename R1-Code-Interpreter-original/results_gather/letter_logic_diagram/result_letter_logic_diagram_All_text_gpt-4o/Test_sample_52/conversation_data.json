    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill the 7x7 grid with the letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} such that each row and each column contains each letter exactly once, and all cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter.\n\nLet's analyze the given grid and fill it step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the minor diagonal**: The minor diagonal consists of the following cells:\n   - (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0)\n\n2. **Determine the letter for the minor diagonal**: \n   - Check the given letters on the minor diagonal. The only pre-filled cell on the minor diagonal is (1,5) with the letter 'c'.\n   - Therefore, all cells on the minor diagonal must be filled with 'c'.\n\n3. **Fill the minor diagonal with 'c'**:\n   - (0,6) = c\n   - (1,5) = c (already filled)\n   - (2,4) = c\n   - (3,3) = c\n   - (4,2) = c\n   - (5,1) = c\n   - (6,0) = c\n\n4. **Fill the rest of the grid**:\n   - For each row and column, ensure that each letter {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} appears exactly once.\n   - Use the process of elimination and logical deduction to fill in the missing letters, ensuring that the constraints are satisfied.\n\nLet's fill in the grid:\n\n- **Row 1**: The given letters are b and e. The minor diagonal cell (0,6) is c. The missing letters are a, d, f, g.\n  - Row 1: a, d, f, b, g, e, c\n\n- **Row 2**: The given letters are f, d, c, a. The minor diagonal cell (1,5) is c. The missing letters are b, e, g.\n  - Row 2: f, g, b, d, e, c, a\n\n- **Row 3**: The given letters are e, a, f. The minor diagonal cell (2,4) is c. The missing letters are b, d, g.\n  - Row 3: g, c, d, e, a, f, b\n\n- **Row 4**: The given letters are b, d, f. The minor diagonal cell (3,3) is c. The missing letters are a, e, g.\n  - Row 4: b, d, g, c, a, e, f\n\n- **Row 5**: The given letters are d, e. The minor diagonal cell (4,2) is c. The missing letters are a, b, f, g.\n  - Row 5: d, e, a, g, f, b, c\n\n- **Row 6**: The given letters are f, g. The minor diagonal cell (5,1) is c. The missing letters are a, b, d, e.\n  - Row 6: e, c, b, f, g, a, d\n\n- **Row 7**: The given letters are c, f, b. The minor diagonal cell (6,0) is c. The missing letters are a, d, e, g.\n  - Row 7: c, a, f, g, b, d, e\n\nNow, let's present the final filled grid:\n\n<<<\na,d,f,b,g,e,c\nf,g,b,d,e,c,a\ng,c,d,e,a,f,b\nb,d,g,c,a,e,f\nd,e,a,g,f,b,c\ne,c,b,f,g,a,d\nc,a,f,g,b,d,e\n>>>"
