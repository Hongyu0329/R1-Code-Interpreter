    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill the 7x7 grid with the letters {a..g} such that each row and each column contains exactly one of each letter, and all cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n### Initial Grid:\n```\n,b,d,,e,g,f\n,,a,e,g,,\nd,a,,,,c,\na,e,,,,b,\n,,f,c,b,,a\n,f,c,,d,,\nf,,b,,,,g\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Minor Diagonal:**\n   - The minor diagonal consists of the following cells: (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0).\n   - These cells must all contain the same letter.\n\n2. **Determine the Letter for the Minor Diagonal:**\n   - Check the pre-filled cells on the minor diagonal: (0,6) = f, (5,1) = f, (6,0) = f.\n   - Since these cells already contain 'f', the entire minor diagonal must be filled with 'f'.\n\n3. **Fill the Minor Diagonal:**\n   - Fill the remaining cells on the minor diagonal with 'f': (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2).\n\n4. **Fill the Grid Row by Row:**\n   - **Row 0:** Already has b, d, e, g, f. Missing letters are a and c. Place them in the empty cells.\n   - **Row 1:** Already has a, e, g, f. Missing letters are b, c, d. Place them in the empty cells.\n   - **Row 2:** Already has d, a, c, f. Missing letters are b, e, g. Place them in the empty cells.\n   - **Row 3:** Already has a, e, b, f. Missing letters are c, d, g. Place them in the empty cells.\n   - **Row 4:** Already has f, c, b, a. Missing letters are d, e, g. Place them in the empty cells.\n   - **Row 5:** Already has f, c, d, f. Missing letters are a, b, e, g. Place them in the empty cells.\n   - **Row 6:** Already has f, b, g. Missing letters are a, c, d, e. Place them in the empty cells.\n\n5. **Ensure Each Column Contains All Letters:**\n   - After filling each row, verify that each column contains all letters from {a..g}.\n\n### Final Filled Grid:\n```\na,b,d,c,e,g,f\nc,g,a,e,f,b,d\nd,a,g,b,f,c,e\na,e,c,f,g,d,b\ng,f,f,c,b,e,a\nb,f,c,g,d,a,e\nf,d,b,a,c,e,g\n```\n\n### Answer:\n```\n<<<\na,b,d,c,e,g,f\nc,g,a,e,f,b,d\nd,a,g,b,f,c,e\na,e,c,f,g,d,b\ng,f,f,c,b,e,a\nb,f,c,g,d,a,e\nf,d,b,a,c,e,g\n>>>\n```"
