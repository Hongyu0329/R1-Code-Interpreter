    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill the 7x7 grid with the letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} such that each row and each column contains each letter exactly once, and all cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the minor diagonal**: The minor diagonal consists of the following cells:\n   - (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0).\n\n2. **Determine the letter for the minor diagonal**: \n   - The minor diagonal must contain the same letter. We need to check which letter can fit into all these positions without violating the row and column constraints.\n\n3. **Fill the grid**:\n   - Start by filling the minor diagonal with a candidate letter that does not conflict with the pre-filled letters in the corresponding rows and columns.\n   - Then, fill the remaining cells in each row and column, ensuring that each letter appears exactly once per row and column.\n\nLet's fill the grid:\n\n- **Row 0**: d, _, _, e, b, _, g\n  - Minor diagonal (0,6) is 'g', so it fits.\n  - Remaining letters: a, c, f\n  - Fill: d, a, f, e, b, c, g\n\n- **Row 1**: _, _, e, b, _, _, d\n  - Minor diagonal (1,5) is 'c', so it fits.\n  - Remaining letters: a, f, g\n  - Fill: f, g, e, b, a, c, d\n\n- **Row 2**: _, _, b, _, _, _, c\n  - Minor diagonal (2,4) is 'a', so it fits.\n  - Remaining letters: d, e, f, g\n  - Fill: g, f, b, d, a, e, c\n\n- **Row 3**: _, _, a, _, d, c, f\n  - Minor diagonal (3,3) is 'b', so it fits.\n  - Remaining letters: e, g\n  - Fill: e, g, a, b, d, c, f\n\n- **Row 4**: _, a, g, d, _, _, e\n  - Minor diagonal (4,2) is 'f', so it fits.\n  - Remaining letters: b, c\n  - Fill: c, a, g, d, f, b, e\n\n- **Row 5**: _, _, _, _, _, _, _\n  - Minor diagonal (5,1) is 'e', so it fits.\n  - Remaining letters: a, b, c, d, f, g\n  - Fill: b, e, d, f, g, a, c\n\n- **Row 6**: _, _, _, f, _, _, a\n  - Minor diagonal (6,0) is 'd', so it fits.\n  - Remaining letters: b, c, e, g\n  - Fill: d, c, g, f, e, b, a\n\nNow, let's present the filled grid:\n\n<<<\nd,a,f,e,b,c,g\nf,g,e,b,a,c,d\ng,f,b,d,a,e,c\ne,g,a,b,d,c,f\nc,a,g,d,f,b,e\nb,e,d,f,g,a,c\nd,c,g,f,e,b,a\n>>>"
