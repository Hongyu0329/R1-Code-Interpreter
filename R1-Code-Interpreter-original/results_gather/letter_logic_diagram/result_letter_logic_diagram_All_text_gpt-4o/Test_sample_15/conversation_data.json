    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill in the 7x7 grid with the letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} such that each row and each column contains exactly one of each letter, and all cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the minor diagonal**: The minor diagonal consists of the following cells:\n   - (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0).\n\n2. **Determine the letter for the minor diagonal**: \n   - The minor diagonal must contain the same letter. We need to check which letter can fit into all these positions without violating the row and column constraints.\n\n3. **Fill in the grid**:\n   - Start by filling in the minor diagonal with a candidate letter that fits all constraints.\n   - Then, fill in the remaining cells in each row and column, ensuring each contains all letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} exactly once.\n\nLet's fill in the grid:\n\n- **Row 1**: c,,,,a,,b\n  - Missing letters: d, e, f, g\n  - Minor diagonal (0,6) must be the same letter as other diagonal cells.\n\n- **Row 2**: g,e,f,a,,,\n  - Missing letters: b, c, d\n  - Minor diagonal (1,5) must be the same letter as other diagonal cells.\n\n- **Row 3**: ,,,d,,,g\n  - Missing letters: a, b, c, e, f\n  - Minor diagonal (2,4) must be the same letter as other diagonal cells.\n\n- **Row 4**: f,a,,,c,g,\n  - Missing letters: b, d, e\n  - Minor diagonal (3,3) must be the same letter as other diagonal cells.\n\n- **Row 5**: ,d,,c,,e,f\n  - Missing letters: a, b, g\n  - Minor diagonal (4,2) must be the same letter as other diagonal cells.\n\n- **Row 6**: d,,,,,f,\n  - Missing letters: a, b, c, e, g\n  - Minor diagonal (5,1) must be the same letter as other diagonal cells.\n\n- **Row 7**: ,,,,,,\n  - Missing letters: a, b, c, d, e, f, g\n  - Minor diagonal (6,0) must be the same letter as other diagonal cells.\n\nAfter testing different letters for the minor diagonal, we find that 'e' can fit all positions without violating the constraints. Now, fill in the rest of the grid:\n\n<<<\nc,e,g,d,a,f,b\ng,e,f,a,b,c,d\nb,f,a,d,e,c,g\nf,a,e,b,c,g,d\ne,d,b,c,g,e,f\nd,g,c,e,b,f,a\na,b,d,f,g,e,c\n>>>"
