    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill the 7x7 grid with the letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} such that each row and each column contains exactly one of each letter, and all cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter.\n\nLet's analyze the given grid and fill it step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the minor diagonal**: The minor diagonal consists of the following cells:\n   - (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0).\n\n2. **Determine the letter for the minor diagonal**: \n   - The minor diagonal must contain the same letter. We will look for a letter that can fit all these positions without conflicting with the pre-filled letters in the same rows or columns.\n\n3. **Fill the grid**:\n   - Start by filling the minor diagonal with a letter that is not already present in any of the rows or columns of the diagonal cells. \n   - Then, fill the remaining cells in each row and column with the remaining letters, ensuring each row and column contains all letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} exactly once.\n\nLet's fill the grid:\n\n- **Row 0**: The pre-filled letters are d, c, a. The minor diagonal cell (0,6) can be filled with 'e' (since 'e' is not in row 0 or column 6).\n- **Row 1**: The pre-filled letters are d, c, a, f. The minor diagonal cell (1,5) can be filled with 'e'.\n- **Row 2**: The pre-filled letter is d. The minor diagonal cell (2,4) can be filled with 'e'.\n- **Row 3**: The minor diagonal cell (3,3) can be filled with 'e'.\n- **Row 4**: The minor diagonal cell (4,2) can be filled with 'e'.\n- **Row 5**: The pre-filled letters are b, f, g, d, a. The minor diagonal cell (5,1) can be filled with 'e'.\n- **Row 6**: The pre-filled letters are f, g, a, b. The minor diagonal cell (6,0) can be filled with 'e'.\n\nNow, fill the remaining cells in each row and column:\n\n- **Row 0**: Fill with b, e, d, c, a, g, f.\n- **Row 1**: Fill with e, d, c, a, b, f, g.\n- **Row 2**: Fill with d, e, f, b, c, a, g.\n- **Row 3**: Fill with c, a, b, e, f, g, d.\n- **Row 4**: Fill with a, g, e, f, b, c, d.\n- **Row 5**: Fill with b, e, c, g, d, f, a.\n- **Row 6**: Fill with f, c, g, e, a, b, d.\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n<<<\nb,e,d,c,a,g,f\ne,d,c,a,b,f,g\nd,e,f,b,c,a,g\nc,a,b,e,f,g,d\na,g,e,f,b,c,d\nb,e,c,g,d,f,a\nf,c,g,e,a,b,d\n>>>"
