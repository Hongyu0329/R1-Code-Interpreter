    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill in the 7x7 grid with the letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} such that each row and each column contains exactly one of each letter, and all cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter.\n\nLet's analyze the given grid and fill it step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the minor diagonal**: The minor diagonal consists of the following cells:\n   - Row 1, Column 7\n   - Row 2, Column 6\n   - Row 3, Column 5\n   - Row 4, Column 4\n   - Row 5, Column 3\n   - Row 6, Column 2\n   - Row 7, Column 1\n\n2. **Determine the letter for the minor diagonal**: \n   - The minor diagonal must contain the same letter. We need to choose a letter that is not already in any of these positions in the grid. \n   - From the given grid, none of these positions are pre-filled, so we can choose any letter. Let's choose 'f' for the minor diagonal.\n\n3. **Fill the grid**:\n   - Start by filling the minor diagonal with 'f'.\n   - Then, fill in the rest of the grid ensuring each row and column contains each letter exactly once.\n\nLet's fill the grid step by step:\n\n- **Row 1**: Already has 'd', 'b', 'e', 'g'. Needs 'a', 'c', 'f'.\n  - Fill: a, d, c, f, b, e, g\n\n- **Row 2**: Already has 'b', 'g'. Needs 'a', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'.\n  - Fill: e, a, c, b, f, g, d\n\n- **Row 3**: Already has 'f', 'e', 'g'. Needs 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'.\n  - Fill: f, g, a, e, c, d, b\n\n- **Row 4**: Already has 'a', 'd'. Needs 'b', 'c', 'e', 'f', 'g'.\n  - Fill: a, c, g, f, b, d, e\n\n- **Row 5**: Already has 'g', 'a'. Needs 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'.\n  - Fill: b, e, g, c, f, a, d\n\n- **Row 6**: Already has 'g', 'd'. Needs 'a', 'b', 'c', 'e', 'f'.\n  - Fill: c, f, b, d, a, g, e\n\n- **Row 7**: Already has 'c', 'd', 'a', 'b'. Needs 'e', 'f', 'g'.\n  - Fill: f, c, d, g, a, b, e\n\nNow, let's write the final filled grid:\n\n<<<\na,d,c,f,b,e,g\ne,a,c,b,f,g,d\nf,g,a,e,c,d,b\na,c,g,f,b,d,e\nb,e,g,c,f,a,d\nc,f,b,d,a,g,e\nf,c,d,g,a,b,e\n>>>"
