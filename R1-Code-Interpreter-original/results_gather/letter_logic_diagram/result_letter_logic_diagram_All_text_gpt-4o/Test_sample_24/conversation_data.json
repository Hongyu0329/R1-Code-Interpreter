    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill the 7x7 grid with the letters {a..g} such that each row and each column contains each letter exactly once, and all cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Minor Diagonal\nThe minor diagonal cells are:\n- (0,6)\n- (1,5)\n- (2,4)\n- (3,3)\n- (4,2)\n- (5,1)\n- (6,0)\n\nWe need to determine which letter can fill all these positions. We will check the pre-filled letters in these positions to see if they suggest a specific letter.\n\n### Step 2: Fill the Minor Diagonal\n- (0,6) is empty.\n- (1,5) is empty.\n- (2,4) is 'e'.\n- (3,3) is empty.\n- (4,2) is 'e'.\n- (5,1) is empty.\n- (6,0) is empty.\n\nSince positions (2,4) and (4,2) are both 'e', the minor diagonal must be filled with 'e'.\n\n### Step 3: Fill the Grid\nNow, we will fill the grid row by row, ensuring each row and column contains each letter exactly once.\n\n#### Row 1: f, d, a, _, _, g, e\n- Missing letters: b, c\n- Fill: f, d, a, b, c, g, e\n\n#### Row 2: d, _, _, b, _, _, f\n- Missing letters: a, c, e, g\n- Fill: d, g, e, b, c, a, f\n\n#### Row 3: _, c, b, _, e, _, _\n- Missing letters: a, d, f, g\n- Fill: g, c, b, f, e, d, a\n\n#### Row 4: _, _, g, e, _, _, _\n- Missing letters: a, b, c, d, f\n- Fill: b, a, g, e, f, c, d\n\n#### Row 5: _, g, e, f, _, a, c\n- Missing letters: b, d\n- Fill: d, g, e, f, b, a, c\n\n#### Row 6: _, e, _, _, _, _, _\n- Missing letters: a, b, c, d, f, g\n- Fill: c, e, f, g, a, b, d\n\n#### Row 7: _, _, _, a, _, _, _\n- Missing letters: b, c, d, e, f, g\n- Fill: a, f, d, a, g, e, b\n\n### Final Answer\nThe completed grid is:\n\n<<<\nf,d,a,b,c,g,e\nd,g,e,b,c,a,f\ng,c,b,f,e,d,a\nb,a,g,e,f,c,d\nd,g,e,f,b,a,c\nc,e,f,g,a,b,d\na,f,d,a,g,e,b\n>>>"
