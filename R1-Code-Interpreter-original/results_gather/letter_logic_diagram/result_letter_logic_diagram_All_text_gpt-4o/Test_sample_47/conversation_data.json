    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill in the missing letters in the 7x7 grid while adhering to the given constraints. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - Each row must contain each letter from {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} exactly once.\n   - Each column must contain each letter from {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} exactly once.\n   - All cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) must contain the same letter.\n\n2. **Identify the Minor Diagonal:**\n   - The minor diagonal consists of the following positions: (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0).\n\n3. **Analyze the Given Grid:**\n   ```\n   ,e,b,,,f,\n   ,,d,c,f,g,a\n   ,,c,,,,e\n   ,c,f,g,a,e,\n   c,,g,,,,d\n   f,g,a,e,b,d,c\n   ,,e,b,,c,f\n   ```\n\n4. **Fill the Minor Diagonal:**\n   - We need to choose a letter that can be placed in all positions of the minor diagonal without violating the row and column constraints.\n   - Check each letter from {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} to see if it can fit in all diagonal positions.\n\n5. **Determine the Letter for the Minor Diagonal:**\n   - After checking, we find that 'b' can be placed in all diagonal positions without conflict.\n\n6. **Fill the Grid:**\n   - Start filling the grid row by row, ensuring each row and column contains each letter exactly once.\n   - Use the minor diagonal constraint to guide the placement of 'b'.\n\n7. **Complete the Grid:**\n   - Fill in the remaining cells by checking which letters are missing from each row and column.\n\nFollowing these steps, the completed grid is:\n\n```\n<<<\na,e,b,g,c,f,d\nb,e,d,c,f,g,a\ng,a,c,d,b,f,e\nd,c,f,g,a,e,b\nc,b,g,f,e,a,d\nf,g,a,e,b,d,c\ne,d,e,b,g,c,f\n>>>\n```"
