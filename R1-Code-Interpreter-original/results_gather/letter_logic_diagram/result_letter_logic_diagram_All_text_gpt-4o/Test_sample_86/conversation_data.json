    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill the 7x7 grid with the letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} such that each row and each column contains each letter exactly once, and all cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the minor diagonal**: The minor diagonal consists of the following positions: (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0). All these positions must contain the same letter.\n\n2. **Determine the letter for the minor diagonal**: \n   - Check the pre-filled cells on the minor diagonal. The only pre-filled cell on the minor diagonal is (0,6) with the letter 'a'.\n   - Therefore, all cells on the minor diagonal must be 'a'.\n\n3. **Fill the minor diagonal with 'a'**:\n   - (0,6) is already 'a'.\n   - Fill (1,5) with 'a'.\n   - Fill (2,4) with 'a'.\n   - Fill (3,3) with 'a'.\n   - Fill (4,2) with 'a'.\n   - Fill (5,1) with 'a'.\n   - Fill (6,0) with 'a'.\n\n4. **Fill the rest of the grid**:\n   - For each row and column, ensure that each letter {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} appears exactly once.\n   - Use the process of elimination and logical deduction to fill in the remaining cells, ensuring that no letter repeats in any row or column.\n\nLet's fill in the grid step by step:\n\n- **Row 1**: d, c, f, e, g, b, a\n- **Row 2**: g, e, f, c, b, a, d\n- **Row 3**: c, g, e, b, a, d, f\n- **Row 4**: f, b, a, g, d, c, e\n- **Row 5**: e, f, a, d, c, g, b\n- **Row 6**: b, a, g, f, e, d, c\n- **Row 7**: a, d, c, b, f, e, g\n\nNow, let's present the final answer in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<\nd,c,f,e,g,b,a\ng,e,f,c,b,a,d\nc,g,e,b,a,d,f\nf,b,a,g,d,c,e\ne,f,a,d,c,g,b\nb,a,g,f,e,d,c\na,d,c,b,f,e,g\n>>>\n```"
