    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill the 7x7 grid with the letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} such that each row and each column contains exactly one of each letter, and all cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter.\n\nLet's analyze the given grid and fill it step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the minor diagonal**: The minor diagonal consists of the following cells:\n   - (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0)\n\n2. **Determine the letter for the minor diagonal**: \n   - The minor diagonal must contain the same letter. We need to choose a letter that is not already present in any of these positions. \n   - From the given grid, the minor diagonal positions are empty, so we can choose any letter. However, we must ensure that this letter can fit into the grid without violating the row and column constraints.\n\n3. **Fill the grid**:\n   - Start by filling the minor diagonal with a letter that is not already over-represented in any row or column. Let's choose 'e' for the minor diagonal.\n   - Fill the rest of the grid by ensuring each row and column contains all letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} exactly once.\n\n4. **Step-by-step filling**:\n   - **Row 1**: c, b, e, a, f, g, d\n   - **Row 2**: b, e, a, f, d, c, g\n   - **Row 3**: d, f, g, c, e, a, b\n   - **Row 4**: a, c, f, e, g, b, d\n   - **Row 5**: e, g, d, c, b, a, f\n   - **Row 6**: g, d, c, b, a, f, e\n   - **Row 7**: f, a, b, g, c, d, e\n\n5. **Verify the solution**:\n   - Check each row and column to ensure they contain all letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} exactly once.\n   - Ensure the minor diagonal contains the letter 'e'.\n\nThe final filled grid is:\n\n<<<\nc,b,e,a,f,g,d\nb,e,a,f,d,c,g\nd,f,g,c,e,a,b\na,c,f,e,g,b,d\ne,g,d,c,b,a,f\ng,d,c,b,a,f,e\nf,a,b,g,c,d,e\n>>>"
