    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill the 7x7 grid with the letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} such that each row and each column contains exactly one of each letter, and all cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the minor diagonal**: The minor diagonal consists of the following cells:\n   - (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0).\n\n2. **Determine the letter for the minor diagonal**: \n   - The minor diagonal must contain the same letter. We need to check the pre-filled cells on this diagonal to determine the letter.\n   - From the given grid, the pre-filled cells on the minor diagonal are:\n     - (1,5) = b\n     - (4,2) = b\n   - Since both pre-filled cells on the minor diagonal contain 'b', the entire minor diagonal must be filled with 'b'.\n\n3. **Fill the minor diagonal with 'b'**:\n   - (0,6) = b\n   - (1,5) = b (already filled)\n   - (2,4) = b\n   - (3,3) = b\n   - (4,2) = b (already filled)\n   - (5,1) = b\n   - (6,0) = b\n\n4. **Fill the rest of the grid**:\n   - We need to ensure each row and column contains exactly one of each letter {a, b, c, d, e, f, g}.\n   - We will fill the grid row by row, ensuring the constraints are met.\n\nLet's fill the grid:\n\n- **Row 0**: g, a, f, e, d, c, b\n- **Row 1**: e, f, c, a, d, b, g\n- **Row 2**: d, e, a, c, b, g, f\n- **Row 3**: c, g, e, b, a, f, d\n- **Row 4**: e, d, b, g, f, a, c\n- **Row 5**: a, b, g, f, c, d, e\n- **Row 6**: f, c, d, e, g, a, b\n\nNow, let's present the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<\ng,a,f,e,d,c,b\ne,f,c,a,d,b,g\nd,e,a,c,b,g,f\nc,g,e,b,a,f,d\ne,d,b,g,f,a,c\na,b,g,f,c,d,e\nf,c,d,e,g,a,b\n>>>"
