    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill the 7x7 grid with the letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} such that each row and each column contains exactly one of each letter, and all cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Minor Diagonal**: The minor diagonal consists of the following cells:\n   - (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0)\n\n2. **Determine the Letter for the Minor Diagonal**: \n   - The minor diagonal must contain the same letter. We need to check the pre-filled cells on this diagonal to determine the letter.\n   - From the given grid, the pre-filled cells on the minor diagonal are:\n     - (1,5) = f\n     - (2,4) = c\n     - (3,3) = a\n     - (4,2) = f\n     - (5,1) = a\n   - The letter that appears most frequently among these is 'a' and 'f'. However, since 'a' appears in the center of the grid (3,3), it is a good candidate for the minor diagonal.\n\n3. **Fill the Minor Diagonal with 'a'**:\n   - Set all cells on the minor diagonal to 'a':\n     - (0,6) = a\n     - (1,5) = a\n     - (2,4) = a\n     - (3,3) = a\n     - (4,2) = a\n     - (5,1) = a\n     - (6,0) = a\n\n4. **Fill the Rest of the Grid**:\n   - For each row and column, ensure that each letter from {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} appears exactly once.\n   - Use the pre-filled letters as constraints and fill in the remaining cells.\n\n5. **Check and Adjust**:\n   - After filling the grid, verify that each row and column contains all letters from {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} exactly once.\n   - Ensure that the minor diagonal is filled with the letter 'a'.\n\nFollowing these steps, the completed grid is:\n\n```\na,f,b,d,g,c,e\ng,e,d,f,c,b,a\nb,g,e,a,d,e,f\nf,c,g,a,e,f,d\nd,b,a,c,f,g,b\nc,d,f,e,b,a,g\ne,a,c,g,a,d,c\n```\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<\na,f,b,d,g,c,e\ng,e,d,f,c,b,a\nb,g,e,a,d,e,f\nf,c,g,a,e,f,d\nd,b,a,c,f,g,b\nc,d,f,e,b,a,g\ne,a,c,g,a,d,c\n>>>"
