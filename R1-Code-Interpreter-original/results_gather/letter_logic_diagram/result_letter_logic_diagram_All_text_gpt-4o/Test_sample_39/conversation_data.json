    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill the 7x7 grid with the letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} such that each row and each column contains each letter exactly once, and all cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter.\n\nLet's analyze the given grid and constraints step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Minor Diagonal**: The minor diagonal consists of the following cells:\n   - (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0)\n\n2. **Determine the Letter for the Minor Diagonal**: \n   - The minor diagonal must contain the same letter. We need to check which letter can fit into all these positions without violating the row and column constraints.\n\n3. **Fill the Grid**:\n   - Start by filling the minor diagonal with a candidate letter that does not conflict with the existing letters in the respective rows and columns.\n   - Then, fill the remaining cells in each row and column, ensuring that each letter appears exactly once per row and column.\n\n4. **Check for Conflicts**:\n   - After filling the grid, verify that each row and column contains all letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} exactly once.\n   - Ensure that the minor diagonal contains the same letter throughout.\n\nLet's proceed with filling the grid:\n\n- **Minor Diagonal**: Choose 'c' for the minor diagonal, as it fits without conflict:\n  - (0,6) = c\n  - (1,5) = c\n  - (2,4) = c\n  - (3,3) = c\n  - (4,2) = c\n  - (5,1) = c\n  - (6,0) = c\n\n- **Fill the Remaining Grid**:\n  - Row 1: Fill with 'a', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g' in the remaining positions.\n  - Row 2: Already has 'b', 'a', 'g', 'd', 'f', fill with 'c', 'e'.\n  - Row 3: Already has 'd', 'b', fill with 'a', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'c'.\n  - Row 4: Already has 'g', 'e', fill with 'a', 'b', 'd', 'f', 'c'.\n  - Row 5: Already has 'b', fill with 'a', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'c'.\n  - Row 6: Already has 'c', 'f', 'a', 'd', fill with 'b', 'e', 'g'.\n  - Row 7: Already has 'e', 'f', 'a', 'g', fill with 'b', 'd', 'c'.\n\nAfter filling the grid, verify that each row and column contains each letter exactly once and that the minor diagonal is consistent.\n\nHere is the completed grid:\n\n<<<\na,b,d,e,f,g,c\nb,a,g,d,e,c,f\nf,e,d,g,c,a,b\ng,d,f,c,a,b,e\nd,g,e,f,b,c,a\nc,c,f,b,a,e,d\ne,f,c,a,g,d,b\n>>>"
