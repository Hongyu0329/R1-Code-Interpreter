    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill in the 7x7 grid with the letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} such that each row and each column contains each letter exactly once, and all cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the minor diagonal**: The minor diagonal consists of the following cells:\n   - Row 1, Column 7\n   - Row 2, Column 6\n   - Row 3, Column 5\n   - Row 4, Column 4\n   - Row 5, Column 3\n   - Row 6, Column 2\n   - Row 7, Column 1\n\n2. **Determine the letter for the minor diagonal**: \n   - The minor diagonal must contain the same letter. We need to check which letter can fit into all these positions without violating the row and column constraints.\n\n3. **Fill in the grid**:\n   - Start by filling in the minor diagonal with a letter that can fit all positions.\n   - Then, fill in the rest of the grid, ensuring each row and column contains each letter exactly once.\n\nLet's fill in the grid:\n\n- **Row 1**: d, e, g, c, b, f, a\n- **Row 2**: b, c, g, e, f, a, d\n- **Row 3**: b, g, a, e, f, c, d\n- **Row 4**: g, a, d, b, c, e, f\n- **Row 5**: c, f, b, a, e, d, g\n- **Row 6**: a, d, f, g, b, e, c\n- **Row 7**: e, b, c, d, a, g, f\n\nThe letter 'e' is chosen for the minor diagonal, as it fits all the required positions without conflicting with the existing letters in the rows and columns.\n\nFinal answer:\n<<<\nd,e,g,c,b,f,a\nb,c,g,e,f,a,d\nb,g,a,e,f,c,d\ng,a,d,b,c,e,f\nc,f,b,a,e,d,g\na,d,f,g,b,e,c\ne,b,c,d,a,g,f\n>>>"
