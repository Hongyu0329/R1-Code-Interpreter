    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill the 7x7 grid with the letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} such that each row and each column contains exactly one of each letter, and all cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the minor diagonal**: The minor diagonal consists of the following cells:\n   - (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0)\n\n2. **Determine the letter for the minor diagonal**: \n   - The minor diagonal must contain the same letter. We need to check which letter can fit into all these positions without violating the row and column constraints.\n\n3. **Fill the grid**:\n   - Start by filling the minor diagonal with a candidate letter that can fit all positions.\n   - Then, fill the remaining cells in each row and column, ensuring that each letter appears exactly once per row and column.\n\n4. **Check constraints**:\n   - Ensure that each row and column contains all letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} exactly once.\n   - Ensure that the minor diagonal contains the same letter.\n\nLet's fill the grid:\n\n- **Row 0**: g, b, e, a, d, f, c\n- **Row 1**: b, g, c, d, f, e, a\n- **Row 2**: e, c, g, f, a, d, b\n- **Row 3**: a, d, f, g, c, b, e\n- **Row 4**: f, a, b, c, g, e, d\n- **Row 5**: c, e, d, b, f, g, a\n- **Row 6**: d, f, a, e, b, c, g\n\nThe letter 'g' is chosen for the minor diagonal, as it fits all the positions without violating the constraints.\n\nFinal answer:\n<<<\ng,b,e,a,d,f,c\nb,g,c,d,f,e,a\ne,c,g,f,a,d,b\na,d,f,g,c,b,e\nf,a,b,c,g,e,d\nc,e,d,b,f,g,a\nd,f,a,e,b,c,g\n>>>"
