    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill in the 7x7 grid with the letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} such that each row and each column contains exactly one of each letter, and all cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the minor diagonal**: The minor diagonal consists of the following cells:\n   - Row 1, Column 7\n   - Row 2, Column 6\n   - Row 3, Column 5\n   - Row 4, Column 4\n   - Row 5, Column 3\n   - Row 6, Column 2\n   - Row 7, Column 1\n\n2. **Determine the letter for the minor diagonal**: \n   - The minor diagonal must contain the same letter. We need to check which letter can fit into all these positions without violating the row and column constraints.\n   - By examining the pre-filled grid, we can see that 'c' is not present in any of the minor diagonal positions' rows or columns. Therefore, we can use 'c' for the minor diagonal.\n\n3. **Fill the grid**:\n   - Start by filling the minor diagonal with 'c'.\n   - Then, fill in the remaining cells in each row and column, ensuring that each letter appears exactly once per row and column.\n\nLet's fill in the grid:\n\n- **Row 1**: b, c, a, f, g, e, d\n- **Row 2**: c, f, g, a, e, d, b\n- **Row 3**: f, g, b, e, c, a, d\n- **Row 4**: g, e, c, b, d, a, f\n- **Row 5**: a, g, d, c, b, f, e\n- **Row 6**: e, c, f, g, a, b, d\n- **Row 7**: d, b, e, f, c, g, a\n\nNow, let's present the final answer in the required format:\n\n```\n<<<\nb,c,a,f,g,e,d\nc,f,g,a,e,d,b\nf,g,b,e,c,a,d\ng,e,c,b,d,a,f\na,g,d,c,b,f,e\ne,c,f,g,a,b,d\nd,b,e,f,c,g,a\n>>>\n```"
