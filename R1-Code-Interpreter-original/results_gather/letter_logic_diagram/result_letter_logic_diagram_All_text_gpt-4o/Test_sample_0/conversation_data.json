    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill the 7x7 grid with the letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} such that each row and each column contains exactly one of each letter, and all cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the minor diagonal**: The minor diagonal consists of the following cells:\n   - (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0).\n\n2. **Determine the letter for the minor diagonal**: \n   - The minor diagonal must contain the same letter. We need to check the pre-filled cells on this diagonal to determine the letter.\n   - From the given grid, the pre-filled cells on the minor diagonal are:\n     - (1,5): 'c'\n     - (3,3): 'g'\n     - (5,1): 'c'\n   - Since 'c' appears twice and 'g' once, we can choose 'c' as the letter for the minor diagonal.\n\n3. **Fill the minor diagonal with 'c'**:\n   - (0,6): c\n   - (1,5): c (already filled)\n   - (2,4): c\n   - (3,3): c\n   - (4,2): c\n   - (5,1): c (already filled)\n   - (6,0): c\n\n4. **Fill the rest of the grid**:\n   - We need to ensure each row and column contains exactly one of each letter {a, b, c, d, e, f, g}.\n   - We will fill the grid row by row, ensuring the constraints are met.\n\nLet's fill the grid:\n\n- **Row 0**: Already has 'e' at (0,2) and 'c' at (0,6).\n  - Fill the remaining cells with {a, b, d, f, g}.\n\n- **Row 1**: Already has 'g' at (1,0), 'e' at (1,1), 'f' at (1,2), and 'c' at (1,5).\n  - Fill the remaining cells with {a, b, d}.\n\n- **Row 2**: Already has 'a' at (2,3) and 'c' at (2,4).\n  - Fill the remaining cells with {b, d, e, f, g}.\n\n- **Row 3**: Already has 'c' at (3,3) and 'e' at (3,6).\n  - Fill the remaining cells with {a, b, d, f, g}.\n\n- **Row 4**: Already has 'a' at (4,1), 'd' at (4,2), 'c' at (4,3).\n  - Fill the remaining cells with {b, e, f, g}.\n\n- **Row 5**: Already has 'd' at (5,0), 'c' at (5,1), 'g' at (5,2), 'f' at (5,4), 'b' at (5,5).\n  - Fill the remaining cells with {a, e}.\n\n- **Row 6**: Already has 'd' at (6,1), 'c' at (6,0), 'g' at (6,2), 'f' at (6,4), 'b' at (6,5).\n  - Fill the remaining cells with {a, e}.\n\nBy carefully filling each row and column while respecting the constraints, we can complete the grid.\n\nHere is the completed grid:\n\n<<<\nb,f,e,g,d,a,c\ng,e,f,b,a,c,d\nf,g,b,a,c,d,e\na,b,d,c,f,g,e\na,d,c,e,g,f,b\nd,c,g,f,e,b,a\nc,a,g,d,e,f,b\n>>>"
