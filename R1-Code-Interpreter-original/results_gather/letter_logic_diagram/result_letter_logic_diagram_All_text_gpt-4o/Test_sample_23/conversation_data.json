    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill the 7x7 grid with the letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} such that each row and each column contains each letter exactly once, and all cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the minor diagonal**: The minor diagonal consists of the following cells:\n   - (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0).\n\n2. **Determine the letter for the minor diagonal**: \n   - The minor diagonal must contain the same letter. We need to check the pre-filled cells on this diagonal to determine the letter.\n   - From the given grid, the pre-filled cells on the minor diagonal are:\n     - (0,6) = f\n     - (1,5) = f\n     - (5,1) = f\n   - Since these cells are already filled with 'f', the letter for the entire minor diagonal must be 'f'.\n\n3. **Fill the grid**: \n   - We will fill the grid row by row, ensuring each row and column contains each letter exactly once, and the minor diagonal is filled with 'f'.\n\nLet's fill the grid:\n\n- **Row 1**: c, g, b, a, e, f, d\n  - The minor diagonal cell (0,6) is 'f', so the remaining letter for this row is 'd'.\n\n- **Row 2**: d, c, a, e, f, b, g\n  - The minor diagonal cell (1,5) is 'f', so the remaining letter for this row is 'g'.\n\n- **Row 3**: g, b, f, e, d, a, c\n  - The minor diagonal cell (2,4) is 'f', so the remaining letter for this row is 'a'.\n\n- **Row 4**: b, a, e, f, d, c, g\n  - The minor diagonal cell (3,3) is 'f', so the remaining letter for this row is 'g'.\n\n- **Row 5**: a, e, f, d, c, g, b\n  - The minor diagonal cell (4,2) is 'f', so the remaining letter for this row is 'g'.\n\n- **Row 6**: e, f, d, c, g, b, a\n  - The minor diagonal cell (5,1) is 'f', so the remaining letter for this row is 'a'.\n\n- **Row 7**: f, d, c, g, b, a, e\n  - The minor diagonal cell (6,0) is 'f', so the remaining letter for this row is 'e'.\n\nNow, let's write the final filled grid:\n\n<<<\nc,g,b,a,e,f,d\nd,c,a,e,f,b,g\ng,b,f,e,d,a,c\nb,a,e,f,d,c,g\na,e,f,d,c,g,b\ne,f,d,c,g,b,a\nf,d,c,g,b,a,e\n>>>"
