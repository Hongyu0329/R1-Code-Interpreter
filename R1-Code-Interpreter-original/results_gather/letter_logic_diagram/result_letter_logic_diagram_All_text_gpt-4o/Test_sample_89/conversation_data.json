    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill the 7x7 grid with the letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} such that each row and each column contains exactly one of each letter, and all cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter.\n\nLet's analyze the given grid and fill it step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the minor diagonal**: The minor diagonal consists of the following cells:\n   - Row 1, Column 7\n   - Row 2, Column 6\n   - Row 3, Column 5\n   - Row 4, Column 4\n   - Row 5, Column 3\n   - Row 6, Column 2\n   - Row 7, Column 1\n\n2. **Determine the letter for the minor diagonal**: \n   - From the given grid, we see that Row 4, Column 4 is empty, so we can choose any letter for the minor diagonal. However, we must ensure that this letter does not conflict with the existing letters in the same row or column.\n\n3. **Fill the grid**:\n   - Start by filling the minor diagonal with a letter that does not conflict with the existing letters in the corresponding rows and columns. Let's choose 'e' for the minor diagonal, as it seems to fit without conflict.\n   - Fill the rest of the grid by ensuring each row and column contains all letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} exactly once.\n\n4. **Step-by-step filling**:\n   - Row 1: Already has a, g, b, c. Fill with e, f, d.\n   - Row 2: Already has a, c, d. Fill with b, e, f, g.\n   - Row 3: Already has a, g, e, b. Fill with c, d, f.\n   - Row 4: Already has g, b, d, f, a. Fill with c, e.\n   - Row 5: Already has e, b, f, g. Fill with a, c, d.\n   - Row 6: Already has d, f, a. Fill with b, c, e, g.\n   - Row 7: Already has d, f, a, g, e, b. Fill with c.\n\n5. **Verify the solution**:\n   - Ensure each row and column contains all letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} exactly once.\n   - Ensure the minor diagonal contains the letter 'e'.\n\nHere is the completed grid:\n\n<<<\ne,f,a,g,e,b,c\na,e,g,f,c,d,b\na,g,e,b,c,d,f\ng,c,b,e,d,f,a\ne,b,c,d,f,a,g\nb,e,d,f,a,g,c\nd,f,a,g,e,b,c\n>>>"
