    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill in the missing letters in the 7x7 grid while adhering to the given constraints. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - Each row must contain each letter from {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} exactly once.\n   - Each column must contain each letter from {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} exactly once.\n   - All cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) must contain the same letter.\n\n2. **Identify the Minor Diagonal:**\n   - The minor diagonal consists of the following positions: (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0).\n\n3. **Analyze the Given Grid:**\n   - We have some pre-filled letters. We need to use these to deduce the missing letters while respecting the constraints.\n\n4. **Fill the Minor Diagonal:**\n   - Check the pre-filled letters on the minor diagonal. We have:\n     - (0,6) is empty\n     - (1,5) is 'e'\n     - (2,4) is empty\n     - (3,3) is empty\n     - (4,2) is 'a'\n     - (5,1) is 'e'\n     - (6,0) is empty\n   - Since (1,5) and (5,1) are both 'e', the entire minor diagonal must be 'e'.\n\n5. **Fill the Grid:**\n   - Start filling the grid row by row, ensuring each row and column contains each letter exactly once.\n   - Use the minor diagonal constraint to fill 'e' in the appropriate positions.\n\n6. **Step-by-Step Filling:**\n   - **Row 1:** Already has 'g', 'd'. Needs 'a', 'b', 'c', 'e', 'f'.\n     - Fill: b, c, g, d, f, a, e\n   - **Row 2:** Already has 'a', 'g', 'c', 'e'. Needs 'b', 'd', 'f'.\n     - Fill: a, g, f, c, b, e, d\n   - **Row 3:** Already has 'g', 'c', 'f'. Needs 'a', 'b', 'd', 'e'.\n     - Fill: g, e, c, f, d, b, a\n   - **Row 4:** Already has 'd', 'c', 'f', 'a'. Needs 'b', 'e', 'g'.\n     - Fill: d, c, f, e, g, a, b\n   - **Row 5:** Already has 'a', 'g', 'd'. Needs 'b', 'c', 'e', 'f'.\n     - Fill: e, f, a, b, c, g, d\n   - **Row 6:** Already has 'f', 'e', 'g', 'd'. Needs 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n     - Fill: f, e, b, a, g, d, c\n   - **Row 7:** Already has 'b', 'a', 'g', 'c'. Needs 'd', 'e', 'f'.\n     - Fill: c, b, a, g, e, f, d\n\n7. **Verify:**\n   - Ensure each row and column contains each letter exactly once.\n   - Ensure the minor diagonal is filled with 'e'.\n\nFinal Answer:\n```\n<<<\nb,c,g,d,f,a,e\na,g,f,c,b,e,d\ng,e,c,f,d,b,a\nd,c,f,e,g,a,b\ne,f,a,b,c,g,d\nf,e,b,a,g,d,c\nc,b,a,g,e,f,d\n>>>\n```"
