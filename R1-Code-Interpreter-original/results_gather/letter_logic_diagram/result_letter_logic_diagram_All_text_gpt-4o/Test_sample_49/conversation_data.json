    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill the 7x7 grid with the letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} such that each row and each column contains each letter exactly once, and all cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter.\n\nLet's analyze the given grid and fill it step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the minor diagonal**: The minor diagonal consists of the following cells:\n   - (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0)\n\n2. **Determine the letter for the minor diagonal**: \n   - The minor diagonal must contain the same letter. We need to check which letter can fit into all these positions without violating the row and column constraints.\n\n3. **Fill the grid**:\n   - Start by filling the minor diagonal with a letter that can fit all positions. We will try each letter and see if it fits.\n   - Then, fill the rest of the grid by ensuring each row and column contains each letter exactly once.\n\nLet's fill the grid:\n\n- **Row 0**: ,,,,d,,e\n  - Minor diagonal position (0,6) is 'e'. We need to fill the rest with {a, b, c, f, g}.\n  - Fill: a,b,c,d,f,g,e\n\n- **Row 1**: c,f,,,g,,\n  - Minor diagonal position (1,5) is 'g'. We need to fill the rest with {a, b, d, e}.\n  - Fill: c,f,e,a,g,b,d\n\n- **Row 2**: f,b,,,,a,c\n  - Minor diagonal position (2,4) is 'a'. We need to fill the rest with {d, e, g}.\n  - Fill: f,b,g,e,a,d,c\n\n- **Row 3**: ,d,,e,,c,\n  - Minor diagonal position (3,3) is 'e'. We need to fill the rest with {a, b, f, g}.\n  - Fill: g,d,f,e,b,c,a\n\n- **Row 4**: ,g,,a,,,b\n  - Minor diagonal position (4,2) is 'a'. We need to fill the rest with {c, d, e, f}.\n  - Fill: e,g,a,c,f,d,b\n\n- **Row 5**: ,,a,c,,,\n  - Minor diagonal position (5,1) is 'c'. We need to fill the rest with {b, d, e, f, g}.\n  - Fill: b,c,a,c,e,g,f\n\n- **Row 6**: ,,,,b,d,\n  - Minor diagonal position (6,0) is 'b'. We need to fill the rest with {a, c, e, f, g}.\n  - Fill: b,e,f,g,b,d,a\n\nNow, let's present the final filled grid:\n\n<<<\na,b,c,d,f,g,e\nc,f,e,a,g,b,d\nf,b,g,e,a,d,c\ng,d,f,e,b,c,a\ne,g,a,c,f,d,b\nb,c,a,c,e,g,f\nb,e,f,g,b,d,a\n>>>"
