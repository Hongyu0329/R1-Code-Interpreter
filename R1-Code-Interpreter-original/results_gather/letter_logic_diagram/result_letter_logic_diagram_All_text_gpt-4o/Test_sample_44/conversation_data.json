    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill in the 7x7 grid with the letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} such that each row and each column contains exactly one of each letter, and all cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the minor diagonal**: The minor diagonal consists of the following cells:\n   - (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0).\n\n2. **Determine the letter for the minor diagonal**: \n   - The minor diagonal must contain the same letter. We need to check the pre-filled cells on this diagonal to determine the letter.\n   - The pre-filled cells on the minor diagonal are:\n     - (0,6) = f\n     - (1,5) = b\n     - (2,4) = (empty)\n     - (3,3) = f\n     - (4,2) = (empty)\n     - (5,1) = (empty)\n     - (6,0) = (empty)\n   - Since (0,6) and (3,3) are both 'f', the letter for the minor diagonal is 'f'.\n\n3. **Fill the minor diagonal with 'f'**:\n   - (0,6) = f\n   - (1,5) = f\n   - (2,4) = f\n   - (3,3) = f\n   - (4,2) = f\n   - (5,1) = f\n   - (6,0) = f\n\n4. **Fill the rest of the grid**:\n   - We need to ensure each row and column contains exactly one of each letter {a, b, c, d, e, f, g}.\n   - We will fill the grid row by row, ensuring the constraints are met.\n\nLet's fill the grid:\n\n- **Row 0**: b, c, d, e, g, a, f\n- **Row 1**: a, e, g, c, d, f, b\n- **Row 2**: e, d, a, b, f, c, g\n- **Row 3**: e, g, c, f, b, a, d\n- **Row 4**: a, f, f, b, g, c, e\n- **Row 5**: c, f, b, g, e, d, a\n- **Row 6**: f, a, e, d, c, g, b\n\nNow, let's format the answer as requested:\n\n<<<\nb,c,d,e,g,a,f\na,e,g,c,d,f,b\ne,d,a,b,f,c,g\ne,g,c,f,b,a,d\na,f,f,b,g,c,e\nc,f,b,g,e,d,a\nf,a,e,d,c,g,b\n>>>"
