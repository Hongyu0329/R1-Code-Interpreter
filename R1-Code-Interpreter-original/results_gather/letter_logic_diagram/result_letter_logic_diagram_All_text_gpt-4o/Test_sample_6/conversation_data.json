    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill the 7x7 grid with the letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} such that each row and each column contains exactly one of each letter, and all cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter. Let's analyze the puzzle step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Minor Diagonal**: The minor diagonal consists of the following cells:\n   - Row 1, Column 7\n   - Row 2, Column 6\n   - Row 3, Column 5\n   - Row 4, Column 4\n   - Row 5, Column 3\n   - Row 6, Column 2\n   - Row 7, Column 1\n\n2. **Determine the Letter for the Minor Diagonal**: \n   - The minor diagonal must contain the same letter. We need to check which letter can fit into all these positions without violating the row and column constraints.\n\n3. **Fill the Grid**:\n   - Start by filling the minor diagonal with a candidate letter that does not conflict with the existing letters in the respective rows and columns.\n   - Then, fill the remaining cells in each row and column, ensuring that each letter appears exactly once per row and column.\n\n4. **Check Constraints**:\n   - Ensure that each row and column contains all letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} exactly once.\n   - Verify that the minor diagonal contains the same letter.\n\nLet's fill the grid step by step:\n\n- **Row 1**: c, b, a, d, e, f, g\n- **Row 2**: b, g, f, e, c, a, d\n- **Row 3**: e, d, g, f, a, c, b\n- **Row 4**: d, a, c, g, b, e, f\n- **Row 5**: f, e, b, c, g, d, a\n- **Row 6**: g, c, d, a, f, b, e\n- **Row 7**: a, f, e, b, d, g, c\n\nThe letter 'g' is chosen for the minor diagonal, as it fits without conflict.\n\nFinal Answer:\n<<<\nc,b,a,d,e,f,g\nb,g,f,e,c,a,d\ne,d,g,f,a,c,b\nd,a,c,g,b,e,f\nf,e,b,c,g,d,a\ng,c,d,a,f,b,e\na,f,e,b,d,g,c\n>>>"
