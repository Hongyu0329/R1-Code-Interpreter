    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill in the 7x7 grid with the letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} such that each row and each column contains each letter exactly once, and all cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the minor diagonal**: The minor diagonal consists of the following positions: (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0). All these positions must contain the same letter.\n\n2. **Check pre-filled cells**: \n   - Row 1: d, a, _, _, g, _, _\n   - Row 2: _, _, _, g, e, _, _\n   - Row 3: f, _, g, _, c, _, _\n   - Row 4: _, g, _, _, _, a, _\n   - Row 5: g, e, _, _, _, _, f\n   - Row 6: e, _, _, _, _, b, _\n   - Row 7: _, d, _, f, b, _, e\n\n3. **Determine the letter for the minor diagonal**:\n   - The minor diagonal positions are (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0).\n   - Check which letter can fit all these positions without conflicting with the pre-filled letters in their respective rows and columns.\n\n4. **Fill the minor diagonal**:\n   - After checking, we find that the letter 'c' can fit all these positions without conflict.\n\n5. **Fill the grid**:\n   - Use the constraints of each row and column having all letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} exactly once to fill in the remaining cells.\n\nFollowing these steps, we fill the grid as follows:\n\n<<<\nd,a,b,c,g,f,e\nc,f,d,g,e,b,a\nf,e,g,a,c,d,b\nb,g,e,f,d,a,c\ng,e,c,b,a,d,f\ne,c,a,d,f,b,g\na,d,f,e,b,c,g\n>>>"
