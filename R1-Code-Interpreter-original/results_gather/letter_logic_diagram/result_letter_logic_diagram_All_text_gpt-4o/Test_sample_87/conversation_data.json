    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill the 7x7 grid with the letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} such that each row and each column contains each letter exactly once, and all cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the minor diagonal**: The minor diagonal consists of the following positions: (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0). All these positions must contain the same letter.\n\n2. **Fill the minor diagonal**: We need to choose a letter that can fit into all these positions without violating the row and column constraints. Let's try to determine which letter can be used.\n\n3. **Analyze each row and column**: \n   - Row 1: e, a, c, _, _, _, _\n   - Row 2: _, _, g, f, _, d, e\n   - Row 3: c, g, f, b, d, _, _\n   - Row 4: _, _, b, d, e, _, c\n   - Row 5: _, _, _, _, _, _, _\n   - Row 6: _, d, e, _, c, g, f\n   - Row 7: d, _, _, _, g, f, _\n\n   - Column 1: e, _, c, _, _, d, d\n   - Column 2: a, _, g, _, _, d, _\n   - Column 3: c, g, f, b, _, e, _\n   - Column 4: _, f, b, d, _, _, _\n   - Column 5: _, _, d, e, _, c, g\n   - Column 6: _, d, _, _, _, g, f\n   - Column 7: _, e, _, c, _, f, _\n\n4. **Determine the letter for the minor diagonal**: \n   - Check which letter can fit into all the diagonal positions without repeating in any row or column. \n   - After checking, we find that 'b' can fit into all these positions: (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0).\n\n5. **Fill the grid**: \n   - Fill the minor diagonal with 'b'.\n   - Complete each row and column by ensuring each letter appears exactly once.\n\nAfter filling the grid, we get:\n\n<<<\ne,a,c,g,f,b,d\nb,c,g,f,a,d,e\nc,g,f,b,d,e,a\nf,e,b,d,e,a,c\ng,f,a,c,b,d,e\na,d,e,b,c,g,f\nd,b,c,e,g,f,a\n>>>"
