    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill the 7x7 grid with the letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} such that each row and each column contains each letter exactly once, and all cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter.\n\nLet's analyze the given grid and fill it step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the minor diagonal**: The minor diagonal consists of the following cells:\n   - Row 1, Column 7\n   - Row 2, Column 6\n   - Row 3, Column 5\n   - Row 4, Column 4\n   - Row 5, Column 3\n   - Row 6, Column 2\n   - Row 7, Column 1\n\n2. **Determine the letter for the minor diagonal**: \n   - From the given grid, we see that Row 1, Column 7 is 'a'.\n   - Therefore, all cells on the minor diagonal must be 'a'.\n\n3. **Fill the grid**:\n   - Start by filling the minor diagonal with 'a'.\n   - Then, fill the remaining cells in each row and column, ensuring each letter appears exactly once per row and column.\n\nLet's fill the grid step by step:\n\n- **Row 1**: Already complete: f, b, e, g, d, a\n- **Row 2**: b, e, g, a, a, c\n  - Fill Column 4 with 'f' (missing letter in Row 2 and Column 4).\n\n- **Row 3**: , , , d, a, ,\n  - Fill Column 1 with 'c' (missing letter in Row 3 and Column 1).\n  - Fill Column 2 with 'g' (missing letter in Row 3 and Column 2).\n  - Fill Column 3 with 'f' (missing letter in Row 3 and Column 3).\n  - Fill Column 6 with 'b' (missing letter in Row 3 and Column 6).\n  - Fill Column 7 with 'e' (missing letter in Row 3 and Column 7).\n\n- **Row 4**: e, , , a, c, f,\n  - Fill Column 2 with 'd' (missing letter in Row 4 and Column 2).\n  - Fill Column 3 with 'b' (missing letter in Row 4 and Column 3).\n  - Fill Column 7 with 'g' (missing letter in Row 4 and Column 7).\n\n- **Row 5**: g, , a, c, f, b,\n  - Fill Column 2 with 'e' (missing letter in Row 5 and Column 2).\n  - Fill Column 7 with 'd' (missing letter in Row 5 and Column 7).\n\n- **Row 6**: d, a, c, f, b, e, g\n  - Already complete.\n\n- **Row 7**: a, c, , , e, g, d\n  - Fill Column 3 with 'g' (missing letter in Row 7 and Column 3).\n  - Fill Column 4 with 'b' (missing letter in Row 7 and Column 4).\n\nNow, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\nf,b,e,g,d,a,c\nb,e,g,f,a,c,d\nc,g,f,d,a,b,e\ne,d,b,a,c,f,g\ng,e,a,c,f,b,d\nd,a,c,f,b,e,g\na,c,g,b,e,g,d\n>>>"
