    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill in the missing letters in the 7x7 grid while adhering to the given constraints. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - Each row must contain each letter from {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} exactly once.\n   - Each column must contain each letter from {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} exactly once.\n   - All cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) must contain the same letter.\n\n2. **Identify the Minor Diagonal:**\n   - The minor diagonal consists of the following positions: (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0).\n\n3. **Analyze the Given Grid:**\n   ```\n   a,e,,f,g,c,\n   ,b,,,,d,a\n   b,f,g,c,d,a,e\n   f,,c,,a,,b\n   g,c,d,a,e,b,f\n   c,,,e,b,,g\n   d,,,,f,g,c\n   ```\n\n4. **Determine the Letter for the Minor Diagonal:**\n   - Check the given letters on the minor diagonal: (0,6) is empty, (1,5) is empty, (2,4) is 'd', (3,3) is empty, (4,2) is 'd', (5,1) is empty, (6,0) is 'd'.\n   - Since 'd' appears twice on the minor diagonal, it is likely the letter for the entire diagonal.\n\n5. **Fill the Grid:**\n   - Start by filling the minor diagonal with 'd'.\n   - Use the constraints to fill in the rest of the grid, ensuring each row and column contains each letter exactly once.\n\n6. **Step-by-Step Filling:**\n   - Row 1: a, e, d, f, g, c, b\n   - Row 2: e, b, f, g, c, d, a\n   - Row 3: b, f, g, c, d, a, e\n   - Row 4: f, g, c, d, a, e, b\n   - Row 5: g, c, d, a, e, b, f\n   - Row 6: c, a, b, e, f, g, d\n   - Row 7: d, e, a, b, f, g, c\n\n7. **Verify the Solution:**\n   - Check each row and column to ensure they contain each letter exactly once.\n   - Confirm that the minor diagonal is filled with 'd'.\n\nThe final filled grid is:\n\n```\n<<<\na,e,d,f,g,c,b\ne,b,f,g,c,d,a\nb,f,g,c,d,a,e\nf,g,c,d,a,e,b\ng,c,d,a,e,b,f\nc,a,b,e,f,g,d\nd,e,a,b,f,g,c\n>>>\n```"
