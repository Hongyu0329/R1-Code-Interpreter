    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill in the missing letters in the 7x7 grid while adhering to the given constraints. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - Each row must contain each letter from {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} exactly once.\n   - Each column must contain each letter from {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} exactly once.\n   - All cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) must contain the same letter.\n\n2. **Identify the Minor Diagonal:**\n   - The minor diagonal consists of the following positions: (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0).\n\n3. **Analyze the Given Grid:**\n   ```\n   g,c,b,f,e,d,\n   ,,,e,d,a,\n   ,,e,d,a,g,\n   f,e,,,g,c,b\n   e,d,a,,,,f\n   d,,g,c,,,e\n   ,g,,b,f,,\n   ```\n\n4. **Determine the Letter for the Minor Diagonal:**\n   - Check the given letters on the minor diagonal: (0,6) is empty, (1,5) is 'a', (2,4) is 'a', (3,3) is empty, (4,2) is 'a', (5,1) is empty, (6,0) is empty.\n   - Since (1,5), (2,4), and (4,2) are 'a', the letter for the entire minor diagonal must be 'a'.\n\n5. **Fill the Minor Diagonal with 'a':**\n   - Fill positions (0,6), (3,3), (5,1), and (6,0) with 'a'.\n\n6. **Fill the Grid Row by Row:**\n   - For each row, identify the missing letters and fill them in such a way that each row and column contains each letter exactly once.\n\n7. **Step-by-Step Filling:**\n   - **Row 1:** g, c, b, f, e, d, a\n   - **Row 2:** a, g, f, e, d, a, c\n   - **Row 3:** c, f, e, d, a, g, b\n   - **Row 4:** f, e, a, a, g, c, b\n   - **Row 5:** e, d, a, b, c, f, g\n   - **Row 6:** d, a, g, c, b, f, e\n   - **Row 7:** b, g, c, b, f, e, a\n\n8. **Verify the Solution:**\n   - Ensure each row and column contains each letter exactly once.\n   - Ensure the minor diagonal contains the letter 'a'.\n\nThe final filled grid is:\n\n```\n<<<\ng,c,b,f,e,d,a\na,g,f,e,d,a,c\nc,f,e,d,a,g,b\nf,e,a,a,g,c,b\ne,d,a,b,c,f,g\nd,a,g,c,b,f,e\nb,g,c,b,f,e,a\n>>>\n```"
