    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill in the missing letters in the 7x7 grid while adhering to the given constraints. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - Each row must contain each letter from {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} exactly once.\n   - Each column must contain each letter from {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} exactly once.\n   - All cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) must contain the same letter.\n\n2. **Identify the Minor Diagonal:**\n   - The minor diagonal consists of the following positions: (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0).\n\n3. **Analyze the Given Grid:**\n   ```\n   e, c, b,  , f, d, g\n   c,  ,  , f,  ,  , e\n   b, a,  ,  , g, e, c\n    , f,  ,  , e, c, \n    , d,  , e,  ,  , \n    ,  , e, c, b,  , f\n    ,  , c,  ,  ,  , \n   ```\n\n4. **Determine the Letter for the Minor Diagonal:**\n   - Check the given letters on the minor diagonal: (0,6) is 'g', (1,5) is empty, (2,4) is 'g', (3,3) is empty, (4,2) is empty, (5,1) is empty, (6,0) is empty.\n   - Since (0,6) and (2,4) are both 'g', the letter for the entire minor diagonal must be 'g'.\n\n5. **Fill the Minor Diagonal with 'g':**\n   - (1,5) = 'g', (3,3) = 'g', (4,2) = 'g', (5,1) = 'g', (6,0) = 'g'.\n\n6. **Fill the Grid Row by Row:**\n   - **Row 1:** e, c, b, a, f, d, g\n   - **Row 2:** c, g, d, f, a, b, e\n   - **Row 3:** b, a, f, d, g, e, c\n   - **Row 4:** g, f, a, b, e, c, d\n   - **Row 5:** f, d, g, e, c, a, b\n   - **Row 6:** a, g, e, c, b, d, f\n   - **Row 7:** d, e, c, g, f, b, a\n\n7. **Verify the Solution:**\n   - Ensure each row and column contains each letter exactly once.\n   - Ensure the minor diagonal contains only 'g'.\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n```\n<<<\ne,c,b,a,f,d,g\nc,g,d,f,a,b,e\nb,a,f,d,g,e,c\ng,f,a,b,e,c,d\nf,d,g,e,c,a,b\na,g,e,c,b,d,f\nd,e,c,g,f,b,a\n>>>\n```"
