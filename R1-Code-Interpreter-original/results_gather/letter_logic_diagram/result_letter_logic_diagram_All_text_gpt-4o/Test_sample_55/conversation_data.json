    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill in the missing letters in the 7x7 grid while adhering to the given constraints. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - Each row must contain each letter from 'a' to 'g' exactly once.\n   - Each column must contain each letter from 'a' to 'g' exactly once.\n   - All cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) must contain the same letter.\n\n2. **Identify the Minor Diagonal:**\n   - The minor diagonal consists of the following positions: (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0).\n\n3. **Analyze the Given Grid:**\n   ```\n   a,g,,,f,,b\n   ,d,,,e,,a\n   d,,f,e,,a,g\n   c,f,e,b,a,g,\n   ,,b,,g,d,c\n   e,b,a,g,d,c,\n   b,,g,d,c,f,e\n   ```\n\n4. **Determine the Letter for the Minor Diagonal:**\n   - Check the given letters on the minor diagonal: (0,6) is 'b', (1,5) is 'a', (2,4) is 'a', (3,3) is empty, (4,2) is 'b', (5,1) is 'b', (6,0) is 'b'.\n   - The majority of the filled positions on the minor diagonal are 'b'. Therefore, all cells on the minor diagonal should be 'b'.\n\n5. **Fill the Grid:**\n   - Start by filling the minor diagonal with 'b'.\n   - For each row and column, ensure that each letter from 'a' to 'g' appears exactly once.\n   - Use the process of elimination and logical deduction to fill in the missing letters.\n\n6. **Step-by-Step Filling:**\n   - Row 1: a,g,c,e,f,d,b\n   - Row 2: g,d,c,b,e,f,a\n   - Row 3: d,e,f,e,b,a,g\n   - Row 4: c,f,e,b,a,g,d\n   - Row 5: f,a,b,c,g,d,c\n   - Row 6: e,b,a,g,d,c,f\n   - Row 7: b,c,g,d,c,f,e\n\n7. **Verify the Solution:**\n   - Check each row and column to ensure all letters 'a' to 'g' are present.\n   - Ensure the minor diagonal is filled with 'b'.\n\nThe final filled grid is:\n\n```\n<<<\na,g,c,e,f,d,b\ng,d,c,b,e,f,a\nd,e,f,b,c,a,g\nc,f,e,b,a,g,d\nf,a,b,c,g,d,e\ne,b,a,g,d,c,f\nb,c,g,d,e,f,a\n>>>\n```"
