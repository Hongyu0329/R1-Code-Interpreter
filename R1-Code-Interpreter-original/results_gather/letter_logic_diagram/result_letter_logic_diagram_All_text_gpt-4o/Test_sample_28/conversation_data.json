    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill in the missing letters in the 7x7 grid while adhering to the given constraints. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - Each row must contain each letter from 'a' to 'g' exactly once.\n   - Each column must contain each letter from 'a' to 'g' exactly once.\n   - All cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) must contain the same letter.\n\n2. **Identify the Minor Diagonal:**\n   - The minor diagonal consists of the following positions: (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0).\n\n3. **Analyze the Given Grid:**\n   - Start by filling in the letters that are already given and identify the missing letters in each row and column.\n   - Check the minor diagonal positions to see if any letters are already filled. If a letter is present, all diagonal positions must be filled with this letter.\n\n4. **Fill the Minor Diagonal:**\n   - If any letter is already present on the minor diagonal, fill all diagonal positions with this letter. If not, choose a letter that is not yet used in any diagonal position and fill all diagonal positions with it.\n\n5. **Fill the Grid:**\n   - For each row, identify the missing letters and fill them in such a way that each letter appears exactly once.\n   - For each column, ensure that each letter appears exactly once.\n\n6. **Iterate and Adjust:**\n   - After filling the grid, check each row and column to ensure all constraints are satisfied.\n   - Adjust any discrepancies by swapping letters within the same row or column while maintaining the constraints.\n\nBy following these steps, we can fill in the grid correctly. Here is the completed grid:\n\n```\n<<<\ng,a,f,c,b,e,d\na,b,c,e,f,d,g\nb,c,e,f,g,d,a\nc,e,f,d,g,a,b\ne,f,d,g,a,b,c\nf,d,g,a,b,c,e\nd,g,a,b,c,e,f\n>>>\n```"
