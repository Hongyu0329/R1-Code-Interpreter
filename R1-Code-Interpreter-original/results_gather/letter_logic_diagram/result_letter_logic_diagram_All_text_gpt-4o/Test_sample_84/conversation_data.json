    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill in the 7x7 grid with the letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} such that each row and each column contains exactly one of each letter, and all cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the minor diagonal**: The minor diagonal consists of the following cells:\n   - (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0).\n\n2. **Determine the letter for the minor diagonal**: \n   - Check the pre-filled cells on the minor diagonal. The cell (3,3) is empty, but the other cells on the diagonal are not pre-filled with any specific letter. Therefore, we can choose any letter that fits the constraints of the rows and columns.\n\n3. **Fill the grid row by row**:\n   - **Row 0**: The pre-filled letters are f, e, c. The missing letters are a, b, d, g. The minor diagonal cell (0,6) must be filled with the chosen letter for the diagonal.\n   - **Row 1**: The pre-filled letters are d, f, b, g, e, c. The missing letter is a. The minor diagonal cell (1,5) must be filled with the chosen letter for the diagonal.\n   - **Row 2**: The pre-filled letters are f, b, g, e, a. The missing letters are c, d. The minor diagonal cell (2,4) must be filled with the chosen letter for the diagonal.\n   - **Row 3**: The pre-filled letters are g, a, d. The missing letters are b, c, e, f. The minor diagonal cell (3,3) must be filled with the chosen letter for the diagonal.\n   - **Row 4**: The pre-filled letters are e, d, b. The missing letters are a, c, f, g. The minor diagonal cell (4,2) must be filled with the chosen letter for the diagonal.\n   - **Row 5**: The pre-filled letters are e, a, d, f, b, g. The missing letter is c. The minor diagonal cell (5,1) must be filled with the chosen letter for the diagonal.\n   - **Row 6**: The pre-filled letters are d, f, g. The missing letters are a, b, c, e. The minor diagonal cell (6,0) must be filled with the chosen letter for the diagonal.\n\n4. **Choose the letter for the minor diagonal**:\n   - Since the minor diagonal must contain the same letter, we need to choose a letter that can fit into all the diagonal positions without violating the row and column constraints. After checking the constraints, we find that the letter 'g' can be used for the minor diagonal.\n\n5. **Fill in the grid**:\n   - Fill in the missing letters in each row and column, ensuring that each row and column contains all letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} exactly once.\n\nAfter filling in the grid, we get the following solution:\n\n<<<\na,b,f,g,d,e,c\nd,f,b,g,e,c,a\nf,b,g,e,c,a,d\nc,g,e,g,a,d,f\ng,e,c,a,d,f,b\ne,g,a,d,f,b,c\nb,c,d,f,g,e,a\n>>>"
