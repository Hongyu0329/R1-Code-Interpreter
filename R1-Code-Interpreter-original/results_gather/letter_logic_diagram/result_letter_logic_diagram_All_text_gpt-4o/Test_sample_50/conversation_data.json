    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill in the 7x7 grid with the letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} such that each row and each column contains each letter exactly once, and all cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the minor diagonal**: The minor diagonal consists of the following cells:\n   - (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0).\n\n2. **Determine the letter for the minor diagonal**: \n   - Check the pre-filled cells on the minor diagonal. The cell (3,3) is pre-filled with 'c'. Therefore, all cells on the minor diagonal must be 'c'.\n\n3. **Fill the minor diagonal with 'c'**:\n   - (0,6) = 'c'\n   - (1,5) = 'c'\n   - (2,4) = 'c'\n   - (3,3) = 'c' (already filled)\n   - (4,2) = 'c'\n   - (5,1) = 'c'\n   - (6,0) = 'c'\n\n4. **Fill the rest of the grid**:\n   - For each row and column, ensure that each letter {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} appears exactly once.\n   - Use the pre-filled letters as constraints to determine the placement of the remaining letters.\n\nLet's fill in the grid step by step:\n\n- **Row 0**: c, a, d, g, e, b, c\n- **Row 1**: e, f, e, b, a, c, g\n- **Row 2**: g, d, b, a, c, f, e\n- **Row 3**: b, a, g, c, d, f, e\n- **Row 4**: b, a, c, e, g, d, f\n- **Row 5**: f, c, g, d, f, e, a\n- **Row 6**: d, c, f, g, b, a, e\n\nNow, let's ensure that each row and column contains each letter exactly once and that the minor diagonal is filled with 'c'.\n\nThe final filled grid is:\n\n<<<\nc,a,d,g,e,b,c\ne,f,e,b,a,c,g\ng,d,b,a,c,f,e\nb,a,g,c,d,f,e\nb,a,c,e,g,d,f\nf,c,g,d,f,e,a\nd,c,f,g,b,a,e\n>>>"
