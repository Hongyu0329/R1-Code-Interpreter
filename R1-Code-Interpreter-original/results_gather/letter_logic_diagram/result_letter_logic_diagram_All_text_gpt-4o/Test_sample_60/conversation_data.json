    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill in the 7x7 grid with the letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} such that each row and each column contains exactly one of each letter, and all cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the minor diagonal**: The minor diagonal consists of the following cells:\n   - (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0).\n\n2. **Determine the letter for the minor diagonal**: \n   - Check the pre-filled cells on the minor diagonal. The cell (4,2) is pre-filled with 'c'. Therefore, all cells on the minor diagonal must be 'c'.\n\n3. **Fill the minor diagonal with 'c'**:\n   - (0,6) = 'c'\n   - (1,5) = 'c'\n   - (2,4) = 'c'\n   - (3,3) = 'c'\n   - (4,2) = 'c' (already filled)\n   - (5,1) = 'c'\n   - (6,0) = 'c'\n\n4. **Fill the rest of the grid**:\n   - For each row and column, ensure that each letter {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} appears exactly once.\n   - Use the process of elimination and logical deduction to fill in the remaining cells.\n\nLet's fill in the grid:\n\n- **Row 0**: c, g, d, b, e, f, a\n- **Row 1**: a, f, e, g, c, b, d\n- **Row 2**: f, a, b, e, c, d, g\n- **Row 3**: d, b, g, c, a, e, f\n- **Row 4**: b, e, c, a, c, g, d\n- **Row 5**: e, c, f, d, g, a, b\n- **Row 6**: c, d, a, f, b, g, e\n\nNow, let's present the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<\nc,g,d,b,e,f,a\na,f,e,g,c,b,d\nf,a,b,e,c,d,g\nd,b,g,c,a,e,f\nb,e,c,a,c,g,d\ne,c,f,d,g,a,b\nc,d,a,f,b,g,e\n>>>"
