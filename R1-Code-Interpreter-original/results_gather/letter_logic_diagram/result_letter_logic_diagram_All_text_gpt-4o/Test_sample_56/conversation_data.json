    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill in the 7x7 grid with the letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} such that each row and each column contains exactly one of each letter, and all cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter.\n\nLet's analyze the given grid and fill it step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the minor diagonal**: The minor diagonal consists of the following cells:\n   - (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0)\n\n2. **Determine the letter for the minor diagonal**: \n   - Check the pre-filled cells on the minor diagonal. The cell (3,3) is pre-filled with 'g'.\n   - Therefore, all cells on the minor diagonal must be 'g'.\n\n3. **Fill the minor diagonal with 'g'**:\n   - (0,6) = g\n   - (1,5) = g\n   - (2,4) = g\n   - (3,3) = g (already filled)\n   - (4,2) = g\n   - (5,1) = g\n   - (6,0) = g\n\n4. **Fill the rest of the grid**:\n   - For each row and column, ensure that each letter {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} appears exactly once.\n   - Use the process of elimination and logical deduction to fill in the remaining cells.\n\nLet's fill in the grid step by step:\n\n- **Row 0**: b, a, c, d, e, f, g\n- **Row 1**: e, g, f, c, b, a, d\n- **Row 2**: d, c, b, f, g, e, a\n- **Row 3**: c, f, a, g, d, b, e\n- **Row 4**: a, d, g, b, f, e, c\n- **Row 5**: g, b, d, e, a, c, f\n- **Row 6**: f, e, g, a, c, d, b\n\nNow, let's present the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<\nb,a,c,d,e,f,g\ne,g,f,c,b,a,d\nd,c,b,f,g,e,a\nc,f,a,g,d,b,e\na,d,g,b,f,e,c\ng,b,d,e,a,c,f\nf,e,g,a,c,d,b\n>>>"
