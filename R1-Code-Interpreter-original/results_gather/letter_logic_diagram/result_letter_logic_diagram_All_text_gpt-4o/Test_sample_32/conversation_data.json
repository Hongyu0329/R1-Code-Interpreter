    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill the 7x7 grid with the letters {a..g} such that each row and each column contains exactly one of each letter, and all cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n### Initial Grid:\n```\n1.  ,b,,c,d,f,a\n2.  ,,c,,,,g\n3.  ,c,,,,g,\n4.  c,d,,a,,,e\n5.  d,,a,,b,e,\n6.  f,a,,,,,\n7.  a,,b,e,c,,f\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Minor Diagonal:**\n   - The minor diagonal cells are (1,7), (2,6), (3,5), (4,4), (5,3), (6,2), (7,1).\n   - These cells must all contain the same letter.\n\n2. **Determine the Letter for the Minor Diagonal:**\n   - Check the pre-filled cells on the minor diagonal:\n     - (1,7) = a\n     - (2,6) = (empty)\n     - (3,5) = (empty)\n     - (4,4) = a\n     - (5,3) = a\n     - (6,2) = a\n     - (7,1) = a\n   - Since most of the pre-filled cells on the minor diagonal are 'a', we choose 'a' for the entire minor diagonal.\n\n3. **Fill the Minor Diagonal with 'a':**\n   - (2,6) = a\n   - (3,5) = a\n\n4. **Fill the Grid Row by Row:**\n\n   - **Row 1:** Already has b, c, d, f, a. Missing: e, g.\n     - Fill: e, b, g, c, d, f, a\n\n   - **Row 2:** Already has c, g. Missing: a, b, d, e, f.\n     - Fill: e, f, c, b, d, a, g\n\n   - **Row 3:** Already has c, g, a (minor diagonal). Missing: b, d, e, f.\n     - Fill: e, c, f, d, a, g, b\n\n   - **Row 4:** Already has c, d, a, e. Missing: b, f, g.\n     - Fill: c, d, g, a, f, b, e\n\n   - **Row 5:** Already has d, a, b, e, a (minor diagonal). Missing: c, f, g.\n     - Fill: d, g, a, f, b, e, c\n\n   - **Row 6:** Already has f, a, a (minor diagonal). Missing: b, c, d, e, g.\n     - Fill: f, a, e, g, c, d, b\n\n   - **Row 7:** Already has a, b, e, c, f. Missing: d, g.\n     - Fill: a, g, b, e, c, d, f\n\n### Final Grid:\n```\n1. e,b,g,c,d,f,a\n2. e,f,c,b,d,a,g\n3. e,c,f,d,a,g,b\n4. c,d,g,a,f,b,e\n5. d,g,a,f,b,e,c\n6. f,a,e,g,c,d,b\n7. a,g,b,e,c,d,f\n```\n\n### Answer:\n```\n<<<\ne,b,g,c,d,f,a\ne,f,c,b,d,a,g\ne,c,f,d,a,g,b\nc,d,g,a,f,b,e\nd,g,a,f,b,e,c\nf,a,e,g,c,d,b\na,g,b,e,c,d,f\n>>>\n```"
