    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill the 7x7 grid with the letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} such that each row and each column contains exactly one of each letter, and all cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the minor diagonal**: The minor diagonal consists of the following cells:\n   - (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0).\n\n2. **Determine the letter for the minor diagonal**: \n   - The minor diagonal must contain the same letter. \n   - From the given grid, the cell (2,4) contains 'e', and the cell (5,1) contains 'f'. \n   - Since these two cells are on the minor diagonal, they must contain the same letter. \n   - Therefore, the letter for the minor diagonal is 'f'.\n\n3. **Fill the minor diagonal with 'f'**:\n   - (0,6) = f\n   - (1,5) = f\n   - (2,4) = f (already filled)\n   - (3,3) = f\n   - (4,2) = f\n   - (5,1) = f (already filled)\n   - (6,0) = f\n\n4. **Fill the rest of the grid**:\n   - For each row and column, ensure that each letter {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} appears exactly once.\n   - Use the process of elimination and logical deduction to fill in the remaining cells.\n\nLet's fill in the grid:\n\n- **Row 0**: g, c, e, d, b, a, f\n- **Row 1**: a, b, d, f, c, g, e\n- **Row 2**: c, g, b, e, f, d, a\n- **Row 3**: d, e, f, g, a, c, b\n- **Row 4**: e, f, a, c, g, b, d\n- **Row 5**: f, d, g, b, e, a, c\n- **Row 6**: b, a, c, g, d, f, e\n\nThe final filled grid is:\n\n<<<\ng,c,e,d,b,a,f\na,b,d,f,c,g,e\nc,g,b,e,f,d,a\nd,e,f,g,a,c,b\ne,f,a,c,g,b,d\nf,d,g,b,e,a,c\nb,a,c,g,d,f,e\n>>>"
