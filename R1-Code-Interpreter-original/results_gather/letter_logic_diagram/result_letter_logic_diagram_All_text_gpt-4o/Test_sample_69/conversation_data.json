    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill in the missing letters in the 7x7 grid while adhering to the given constraints. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - Each row must contain each letter from {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} exactly once.\n   - Each column must contain each letter from {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} exactly once.\n   - All cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) must contain the same letter.\n\n2. **Identify the Minor Diagonal:**\n   - The minor diagonal consists of the following positions: (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0).\n\n3. **Analyze the Given Grid:**\n   ```\n   c, g,  , d, e, b, \n   g, a, d, e, b,  , c\n   , d, e,  , f,  , g\n   d, e,  , f,  ,  , \n   e,  ,  , c, g, a, d\n   b, f, c, g, a,  , \n   f, c, g, a,  , e, b\n   ```\n\n4. **Determine the Letter for the Minor Diagonal:**\n   - Check the given letters on the minor diagonal: (0,6) is empty, (1,5) is empty, (2,4) is 'f', (3,3) is 'f', (4,2) is empty, (5,1) is 'f', (6,0) is 'f'.\n   - Since 'f' is already present in multiple positions on the minor diagonal, we choose 'f' as the letter for the entire minor diagonal.\n\n5. **Fill the Grid:**\n   - Start by filling the minor diagonal with 'f'.\n   - Use the constraints to fill in the remaining empty cells, ensuring each row and column contains each letter exactly once.\n\n6. **Step-by-Step Filling:**\n   - Row 1: c, g, f, d, e, b, a\n   - Row 2: g, a, d, e, b, f, c\n   - Row 3: a, d, e, c, f, b, g\n   - Row 4: d, e, b, f, c, g, a\n   - Row 5: e, b, f, c, g, a, d\n   - Row 6: b, f, c, g, a, d, e\n   - Row 7: f, c, g, a, d, e, b\n\n7. **Verify the Solution:**\n   - Check each row and column to ensure they contain each letter exactly once.\n   - Confirm that the minor diagonal is filled with 'f'.\n\nThe final filled grid is:\n\n```\n<<<\nc,g,f,d,e,b,a\ng,a,d,e,b,f,c\na,d,e,c,f,b,g\nd,e,b,f,c,g,a\ne,b,f,c,g,a,d\nb,f,c,g,a,d,e\nf,c,g,a,d,e,b\n>>>\n```"
