    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill in the 7x7 grid with the letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} such that each row and each column contains each letter exactly once, and all cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the minor diagonal**: The minor diagonal consists of the following cells:\n   - (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0).\n\n2. **Determine the letter for the minor diagonal**: \n   - Check the pre-filled cells on the minor diagonal. The cell (5,1) is pre-filled with 'e'.\n   - Therefore, all cells on the minor diagonal must be 'e'.\n\n3. **Fill the minor diagonal with 'e'**:\n   - (0,6) = e\n   - (1,5) = e\n   - (2,4) = e\n   - (3,3) = e\n   - (4,2) = e\n   - (5,1) = e (already filled)\n   - (6,0) = e\n\n4. **Fill the rest of the grid**:\n   - For each row and column, ensure that each letter appears exactly once.\n   - Use the process of elimination and logical deduction to fill in the remaining cells.\n\nLet's fill in the grid step by step:\n\n- **Row 1**: c, d, a, e, f, b, e\n- **Row 2**: a, e, c, f, d, e, g\n- **Row 3**: e, g, f, b, e, c, a\n- **Row 4**: f, a, b, e, c, g, d\n- **Row 5**: d, c, e, g, b, a, f\n- **Row 6**: b, e, g, d, a, e, f\n- **Row 7**: g, f, d, a, e, f, b\n\nNow, let's present the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<\nc,d,a,e,f,b,e\na,e,c,f,d,e,g\ne,g,f,b,e,c,a\nf,a,b,e,c,g,d\nd,c,e,g,b,a,f\nb,e,g,d,a,e,f\ng,f,d,a,e,f,b\n>>>"
