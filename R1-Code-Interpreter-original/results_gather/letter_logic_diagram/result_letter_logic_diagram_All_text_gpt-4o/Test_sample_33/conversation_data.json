    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill in the missing letters in the 7x7 grid while adhering to the given constraints. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - Each row must contain each letter from {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} exactly once.\n   - Each column must contain each letter from {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} exactly once.\n   - All cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) must contain the same letter.\n\n2. **Identify the Minor Diagonal:**\n   - The minor diagonal consists of the following positions: (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0).\n\n3. **Analyze the Given Grid:**\n   ```\n   a, b, _, g, e, c, d\n   _, f, g, e, _, d, _\n   f, g, e, _, _, a, _\n   _, e, c, d, _, _, f\n   e, _, d, _, _, f, _\n   c, _, a, b, _, g, _\n   _, _, b, _, g, e, c\n   ```\n\n4. **Determine the Letter for the Minor Diagonal:**\n   - Check the given letters on the minor diagonal: (0,6) is 'd', (1,5) is 'd', (3,3) is 'd', (5,1) is empty, (6,0) is empty.\n   - Since 'd' appears multiple times on the minor diagonal, it is likely the letter for the entire diagonal.\n\n5. **Fill the Minor Diagonal with 'd':**\n   - Fill the empty positions on the minor diagonal with 'd': (2,4), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0).\n\n6. **Fill the Grid Row by Row:**\n   - For each row, identify the missing letters and fill them in such a way that each row and column contains each letter exactly once.\n\n7. **Step-by-Step Filling:**\n   - **Row 1:** a, b, f, g, e, c, d\n   - **Row 2:** d, f, g, e, c, d, a\n   - **Row 3:** f, g, e, c, d, a, b\n   - **Row 4:** b, e, c, d, a, g, f\n   - **Row 5:** e, a, d, f, b, f, g\n   - **Row 6:** c, d, a, b, f, g, e\n   - **Row 7:** g, c, b, a, g, e, c\n\n8. **Verify the Solution:**\n   - Ensure each row and column contains each letter exactly once.\n   - Ensure the minor diagonal contains the letter 'd'.\n\nFinal Answer:\n```\n<<<\na,b,f,g,e,c,d\nd,f,g,e,c,d,a\nf,g,e,c,d,a,b\nb,e,c,d,a,g,f\ne,a,d,f,b,f,g\nc,d,a,b,f,g,e\ng,c,b,a,g,e,c\n>>>\n```"
