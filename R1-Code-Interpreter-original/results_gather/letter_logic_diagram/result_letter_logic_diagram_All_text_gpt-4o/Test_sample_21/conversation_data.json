    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill in the missing letters in the 7x7 grid while adhering to the given constraints. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - Each row must contain each letter from {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} exactly once.\n   - Each column must contain each letter from {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} exactly once.\n   - All cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) must contain the same letter.\n\n2. **Identify the Minor Diagonal:**\n   - The minor diagonal consists of the following positions: (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0).\n\n3. **Analyze the Given Grid:**\n   - We have some pre-filled letters. We need to use these to deduce the missing letters while respecting the constraints.\n\n4. **Fill the Minor Diagonal:**\n   - We need to choose a letter that can fit into all the positions of the minor diagonal without violating the row and column constraints.\n   - By examining the grid, we can see that 'c' is a suitable candidate for the minor diagonal as it does not conflict with any pre-filled letters in those positions.\n\n5. **Fill the Grid:**\n   - Start filling the grid row by row, ensuring each row and column contains each letter exactly once.\n   - Use the minor diagonal constraint to guide the placement of 'c' in the diagonal positions.\n\n6. **Verify the Solution:**\n   - After filling the grid, check each row and column to ensure all constraints are satisfied.\n\nFollowing these steps, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\nc,d,g,f,a,b,e\nd,e,f,a,b,c,g\ng,f,e,b,c,e,a\nf,a,b,c,e,d,g\na,b,c,e,d,g,f\nb,c,a,d,g,f,c\ne,g,d,g,f,a,b\n>>>"
