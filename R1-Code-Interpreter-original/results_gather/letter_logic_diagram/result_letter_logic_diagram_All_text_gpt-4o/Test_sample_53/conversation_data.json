    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill in the 7x7 grid with the letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} such that each row and each column contains exactly one of each letter, and all cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter.\n\nLet's analyze the given grid and fill it step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the minor diagonal**: The minor diagonal consists of the following cells:\n   - (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0)\n\n2. **Determine the letter for the minor diagonal**: \n   - The minor diagonal must contain the same letter. We need to check the pre-filled cells on this diagonal to determine the letter.\n   - The pre-filled cells on the minor diagonal are (3,3) with 'c' and (5,1) with 'c'.\n   - Therefore, the letter for the minor diagonal is 'c'.\n\n3. **Fill the minor diagonal with 'c'**:\n   - (0,6) = c\n   - (1,5) = c\n   - (2,4) = c\n   - (3,3) = c (already filled)\n   - (4,2) = c\n   - (5,1) = c (already filled)\n   - (6,0) = c\n\n4. **Fill the rest of the grid**:\n   - We will fill each row and column ensuring each contains exactly one of each letter {a, b, c, d, e, f, g}.\n\nLet's fill the grid row by row:\n\n- **Row 0**: \n  - Given: ,,f,,,,\n  - Fill: a,b,f,d,e,g,c\n\n- **Row 1**: \n  - Given: ,,d,e,g,,\n  - Fill: a,b,d,e,g,c,f\n\n- **Row 2**: \n  - Given: ,,e,,,,a\n  - Fill: b,d,e,g,f,c,a\n\n- **Row 3**: \n  - Given: ,,,c,b,a,\n  - Fill: g,f,d,c,b,a,e\n\n- **Row 4**: \n  - Given: e,,,b,,f,\n  - Fill: e,g,a,b,c,f,d\n\n- **Row 5**: \n  - Given: ,c,,a,f,,\n  - Fill: d,c,g,a,f,b,e\n\n- **Row 6**: \n  - Given: ,,,f,d,e,g\n  - Fill: c,a,b,f,d,e,g\n\nNow, let's write the final filled grid:\n\n<<<\na,b,f,d,e,g,c\na,b,d,e,g,c,f\nb,d,e,g,f,c,a\ng,f,d,c,b,a,e\ne,g,a,b,c,f,d\nd,c,g,a,f,b,e\nc,a,b,f,d,e,g\n>>>"
