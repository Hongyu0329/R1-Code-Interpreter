    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill in the missing letters in the 7x7 grid while adhering to the given constraints. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - Each row must contain each letter from 'a' to 'g' exactly once.\n   - Each column must contain each letter from 'a' to 'g' exactly once.\n   - All cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) must contain the same letter.\n\n2. **Identify the Minor Diagonal:**\n   - The minor diagonal consists of the following positions: (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0).\n\n3. **Analyze the Given Grid:**\n   - Start by filling in the letters that are already given in the grid.\n   - Identify which letters are missing in each row and column.\n\n4. **Determine the Minor Diagonal Letter:**\n   - Since the minor diagonal must contain the same letter, we need to find a letter that can fit into all these positions without violating the row and column constraints.\n\n5. **Fill the Grid:**\n   - Use logical deduction to fill in the missing letters, ensuring that each row and column contains all letters from 'a' to 'g' exactly once.\n   - Pay special attention to the minor diagonal, ensuring it contains the same letter throughout.\n\n6. **Verify the Solution:**\n   - After filling in the grid, double-check each row, column, and the minor diagonal to ensure all constraints are satisfied.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given grid:\n\n```\ng,b,f,,c,a,\n,f,d,,a,e,\n,d,c,,,,\n,,,,,,\n,,e,,b,,\na,e,,,,d,c\ne,,,,,c,\n```\n\nBy following the steps and filling in the grid, we arrive at the solution:\n\n```\ng,b,f,e,c,a,d\nc,f,d,g,a,e,b\nb,d,c,f,g,,a\nf,a,g,d,e,b,c\nd,c,e,a,b,g,f\na,e,b,c,f,d,g\ne,g,a,b,d,c,f\n```\n\nThus, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\ng,b,f,e,c,a,d\nc,f,d,g,a,e,b\nb,d,c,f,g,a,e\nf,a,g,d,e,b,c\nd,c,e,a,b,g,f\na,e,b,c,f,d,g\ne,g,a,b,d,c,f\n>>>"
