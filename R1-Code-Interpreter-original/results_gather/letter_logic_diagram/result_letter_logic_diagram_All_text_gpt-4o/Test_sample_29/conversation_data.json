    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill in the missing letters in the 7x7 grid while adhering to the given constraints. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - Each row must contain all letters from 'a' to 'g' exactly once.\n   - Each column must contain all letters from 'a' to 'g' exactly once.\n   - All cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) must contain the same letter.\n\n2. **Identify the Minor Diagonal:**\n   - The minor diagonal consists of the following positions: (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0).\n\n3. **Analyze the Given Grid:**\n   - We have some pre-filled letters in the grid. We need to use these to deduce the missing letters.\n   - The minor diagonal must contain the same letter, which we need to determine.\n\n4. **Determine the Minor Diagonal Letter:**\n   - Check the pre-filled cells on the minor diagonal. The only pre-filled cell on the minor diagonal is (5,1) with the letter 'd'.\n   - Therefore, all cells on the minor diagonal must be 'd'.\n\n5. **Fill the Grid:**\n   - Start by filling the minor diagonal with 'd'.\n   - Use the constraints of rows and columns to fill in the remaining cells, ensuring each row and column contains all letters from 'a' to 'g'.\n\n6. **Step-by-Step Filling:**\n   - Fill the minor diagonal with 'd'.\n   - For each row and column, identify the missing letters and fill them in, ensuring no repetition within the row or column.\n\n7. **Verify the Solution:**\n   - After filling the grid, check each row and column to ensure they contain all letters from 'a' to 'g'.\n   - Ensure the minor diagonal contains only the letter 'd'.\n\nFollowing these steps, the completed grid is:\n\n```\na,e,f,g,d,c,b\ne,f,g,b,c,d,a\nd,g,b,a,f,e,c\nb,c,d,e,a,g,f\nf,d,a,c,b,e,g\nc,d,e,f,g,a,b\ng,a,c,d,e,b,f\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<\na,e,f,g,d,c,b\ne,f,g,b,c,d,a\nd,g,b,a,f,e,c\nb,c,d,e,a,g,f\nf,d,a,c,b,e,g\nc,d,e,f,g,a,b\ng,a,c,d,e,b,f\n>>>"
