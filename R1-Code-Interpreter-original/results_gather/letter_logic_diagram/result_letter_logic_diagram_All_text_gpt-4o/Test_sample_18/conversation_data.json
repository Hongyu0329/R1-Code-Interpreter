    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill in the missing letters in the 7x7 grid while adhering to the given constraints. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - Each row must contain each letter from 'a' to 'g' exactly once.\n   - Each column must contain each letter from 'a' to 'g' exactly once.\n   - All cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) must contain the same letter.\n\n2. **Identify the Minor Diagonal:**\n   - The minor diagonal consists of the following positions: (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0).\n\n3. **Analyze the Given Grid:**\n   - Start by filling in the minor diagonal with a common letter that does not conflict with the existing letters in those positions.\n   - Check each row and column to see which letters are missing and fill them in accordingly.\n\n4. **Fill the Minor Diagonal:**\n   - Choose a letter that can fit into all the positions of the minor diagonal without conflicting with the existing letters in those rows and columns.\n   - After examining the grid, 'f' is a suitable choice for the minor diagonal.\n\n5. **Fill the Grid:**\n   - For each row and column, determine the missing letters and fill them in, ensuring that each letter from 'a' to 'g' appears exactly once per row and column.\n\n6. **Verify the Solution:**\n   - Double-check that each row and column contains all letters from 'a' to 'g'.\n   - Ensure that the minor diagonal is filled with the same letter.\n\nFollowing these steps, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\nc,b,e,g,d,f,a\nb,g,f,a,e,d,c\ng,f,d,e,a,c,b\nf,d,e,c,c,b,g\nd,e,a,f,b,g,c\ne,a,c,b,g,f,d\na,c,b,g,f,a,e\n>>>"
