    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill in the missing letters in the 7x7 grid while adhering to the given constraints. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - Each row must contain each letter from {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} exactly once.\n   - Each column must contain each letter from {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} exactly once.\n   - All cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) must contain the same letter.\n\n2. **Identify the Minor Diagonal:**\n   - The minor diagonal consists of the following positions: (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0).\n\n3. **Analyze the Given Grid:**\n   ```\n   f, d, _, _, _, c, g\n   d, e, _, a, c, _, f\n   e, b, _, _, g, f, _\n   _, _, c, g, f, _, e\n   a, c, g, f, d, e, b\n   _, g, _, d, e, _, a\n   g, f, _, e, b, a, c\n   ```\n\n4. **Determine the Letter for the Minor Diagonal:**\n   - The minor diagonal must contain the same letter. We need to check which letter can fit into all these positions without violating the row and column constraints.\n   - By checking the existing letters in the minor diagonal positions and the constraints, we find that 'b' can fit into all these positions.\n\n5. **Fill the Minor Diagonal with 'b':**\n   - Place 'b' in positions: (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0).\n\n6. **Fill the Remaining Cells:**\n   - For each row and column, fill in the missing letters by ensuring each letter from {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} appears exactly once.\n\n7. **Verify the Solution:**\n   - After filling in the grid, verify that each row and column contains all letters from {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} exactly once and that the minor diagonal is consistent.\n\nFollowing these steps, the completed grid is:\n\n```\nf, d, b, e, a, c, g\nd, e, g, a, c, b, f\ne, b, a, c, g, f, d\nb, a, c, g, f, d, e\na, c, g, f, d, e, b\nc, g, f, d, e, b, a\ng, f, d, e, b, a, c\n```\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<\nf,d,b,e,a,c,g\nd,e,g,a,c,b,f\ne,b,a,c,g,f,d\nb,a,c,g,f,d,e\na,c,g,f,d,e,b\nc,g,f,d,e,b,a\ng,f,d,e,b,a,c\n>>>"
