    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill in the 7x7 grid with the letters {a..g} such that each row and each column contains each letter exactly once, and all cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n### Initial Grid:\n```\nf,,e,,,,\n,e,,d,,,f\n,,,,g,f,a\n,d,b,,,a,\nd,b,,,a,e,\nb,g,,a,e,c,d\n,f,a,,,d,\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify the Minor Diagonal:**\n   - The minor diagonal consists of the following positions: (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0).\n   - All these positions must contain the same letter.\n\n2. **Fill the Minor Diagonal:**\n   - Check the pre-filled cells on the minor diagonal. The only pre-filled cell is (1,5) with 'f'.\n   - Therefore, all cells on the minor diagonal must be 'f'.\n\n3. **Fill the Grid:**\n   - Start filling the grid row by row and column by column, ensuring each letter appears exactly once per row and column.\n\n### Filling the Grid:\n\n- **Row 1:** f, c, e, g, b, d, a\n- **Row 2:** e, a, g, d, c, f, b\n- **Row 3:** c, d, b, e, g, f, a\n- **Row 4:** g, f, d, b, a, c, e\n- **Row 5:** d, b, f, c, a, e, g\n- **Row 6:** b, g, c, a, e, f, d\n- **Row 7:** a, e, f, b, d, g, c\n\n### Final Answer:\n```\n<<<\nf,c,e,g,b,d,a\ne,a,g,d,c,f,b\nc,d,b,e,g,f,a\ng,f,d,b,a,c,e\nd,b,f,c,a,e,g\nb,g,c,a,e,f,d\na,e,f,b,d,g,c\n>>>\n```"
