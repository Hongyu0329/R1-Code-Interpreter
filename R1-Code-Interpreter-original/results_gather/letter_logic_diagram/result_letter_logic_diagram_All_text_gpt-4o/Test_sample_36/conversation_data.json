    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill in the 7x7 grid with the letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} such that each row and each column contains each letter exactly once, and all cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the minor diagonal**: The minor diagonal consists of the following cells:\n   - (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0).\n\n2. **Determine the letter for the minor diagonal**: \n   - Check the pre-filled cells on the minor diagonal. The cell (3,3) is pre-filled with 'b'. Therefore, all cells on the minor diagonal must be 'b'.\n\n3. **Fill the minor diagonal with 'b'**:\n   - (0,6) = b\n   - (1,5) = b\n   - (2,4) = b\n   - (3,3) = b (already filled)\n   - (4,2) = b\n   - (5,1) = b\n   - (6,0) = b\n\n4. **Fill the rest of the grid**:\n   - For each row and column, ensure that each letter {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} appears exactly once.\n   - Use the pre-filled letters as constraints to determine the placement of the remaining letters.\n\nLet's fill in the grid:\n\n- **Row 0**: The pre-filled letters are e, d, c. The minor diagonal is b. The missing letters are a, f, g.\n  - Row 0: a, g, f, e, d, c, b\n\n- **Row 1**: The pre-filled letters are f, e. The minor diagonal is b. The missing letters are a, c, d, g.\n  - Row 1: f, a, e, g, c, b, d\n\n- **Row 2**: The pre-filled letters are d, g. The minor diagonal is b. The missing letters are a, c, e, f.\n  - Row 2: g, e, d, f, b, a, c\n\n- **Row 3**: The pre-filled letters are e, c, b, f. The minor diagonal is b. The missing letters are a, d, g.\n  - Row 3: e, f, c, b, g, d, a\n\n- **Row 4**: The pre-filled letters are d, b, a, e. The minor diagonal is b. The missing letters are c, f, g.\n  - Row 4: d, c, b, a, f, g, e\n\n- **Row 5**: The pre-filled letters are c, g, b, a, e, d. The minor diagonal is b. The missing letter is f.\n  - Row 5: c, b, g, d, a, e, f\n\n- **Row 6**: The pre-filled letters are b, f, d. The minor diagonal is b. The missing letters are a, c, e, g.\n  - Row 6: b, d, f, c, e, g, a\n\nNow, let's write the final answer:\n\n<<<\na,g,f,e,d,c,b\nf,a,e,g,c,b,d\ng,e,d,f,b,a,c\ne,f,c,b,g,d,a\nd,c,b,a,f,g,e\nc,b,g,d,a,e,f\nb,d,f,c,e,g,a\n>>>"
