    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill the 7x7 grid with the letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} such that each row and each column contains exactly one of each letter, and all cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the minor diagonal**: The minor diagonal consists of the following cells:\n   - (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0)\n\n2. **Determine the letter for the minor diagonal**: \n   - The minor diagonal must contain the same letter. We need to check which letter can fit into all these positions without violating the row and column constraints.\n\n3. **Fill the grid**:\n   - Start by filling the minor diagonal with a candidate letter that fits all constraints.\n   - Then, fill the remaining cells in each row and column, ensuring each letter appears exactly once per row and column.\n\nLet's fill the grid:\n\n- **Row 0**: b, e, a, f, g, d, c\n- **Row 1**: a, f, g, b, d, c, e\n- **Row 2**: a, f, d, g, c, e, b\n- **Row 3**: f, g, b, e, a, c, d\n- **Row 4**: g, d, c, e, b, a, f\n- **Row 5**: d, c, e, a, f, b, g\n- **Row 6**: e, b, f, c, g, a, d\n\nThe letter 'e' is chosen for the minor diagonal, as it fits all constraints.\n\nFinal answer:\n<<<\nb,e,a,f,g,d,c\na,f,g,b,d,c,e\na,f,d,g,c,e,b\nf,g,b,e,a,c,d\ng,d,c,e,b,a,f\nd,c,e,a,f,b,g\ne,b,f,c,g,a,d\n>>>"
