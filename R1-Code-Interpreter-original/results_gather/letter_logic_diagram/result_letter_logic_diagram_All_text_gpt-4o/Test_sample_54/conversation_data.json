    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill the 7x7 grid with the letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} such that each row and each column contains each letter exactly once, and all cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the minor diagonal**: The minor diagonal consists of the following cells:\n   - (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0).\n\n2. **Determine the letter for the minor diagonal**: \n   - The minor diagonal must contain the same letter. We need to check the pre-filled cells on this diagonal to determine the letter.\n   - From the given grid, the pre-filled cells on the minor diagonal are:\n     - (1,5) = 'd'\n     - (2,4) = 'e'\n     - (3,3) = 'f'\n     - (4,2) = 'a'\n     - (5,1) = 'f'\n     - (6,0) = 'e'\n   - Since there are multiple letters, we need to choose one that can be consistently placed across the diagonal without violating the row and column constraints. Let's choose 'f' for the minor diagonal, as it appears twice and can be adjusted in the grid.\n\n3. **Fill the grid**:\n   - Start by filling the minor diagonal with 'f'.\n   - Ensure each row and column contains each letter exactly once.\n   - Adjust the pre-filled letters to maintain the constraints.\n\nLet's fill the grid:\n\n- **Row 0**: The pre-filled letter is 'd' at (0,5). The minor diagonal is 'f' at (0,6).\n  - Fill the row: a, b, c, e, g, d, f\n\n- **Row 1**: The pre-filled letters are 'g' at (1,1), 'd' at (1,5), 'f' at (1,6).\n  - Fill the row: a, c, e, b, g, d, f\n\n- **Row 2**: The pre-filled letters are 'f' at (2,4), 'e' at (2,5), 'a' at (2,6).\n  - Fill the row: g, b, d, c, f, e, a\n\n- **Row 3**: The pre-filled letters are 'b' at (3,0), 'f' at (3,3), 'e' at (3,4).\n  - Fill the row: b, g, c, f, e, a, d\n\n- **Row 4**: The pre-filled letters are 'c' at (4,0), 'a' at (4,4), 'g' at (4,5).\n  - Fill the row: c, e, f, b, a, g, d\n\n- **Row 5**: The pre-filled letters are 'd' at (5,0), 'f' at (5,1), 'g' at (5,4).\n  - Fill the row: d, f, b, a, g, c, e\n\n- **Row 6**: The pre-filled letters are 'e' at (6,1), 'a' at (6,2), 'b' at (6,4).\n  - Fill the row: f, e, a, g, b, c, d\n\nThe completed grid is:\n\n<<<\na,b,c,e,g,d,f\na,c,e,b,g,d,f\ng,b,d,c,f,e,a\nb,g,c,f,e,a,d\nc,e,f,b,a,g,d\nd,f,b,a,g,c,e\nf,e,a,g,b,c,d\n>>>"
