    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill in the 7x7 grid with the letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} such that each row and each column contains exactly one of each letter, and all cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the minor diagonal**: The minor diagonal consists of the following positions: (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0). All these positions must contain the same letter.\n\n2. **Check pre-filled cells**: \n   - Row 1: ,a,,g,b,,\n   - Row 2: a,d,g,,,c,\n   - Row 3: d,,,e,c,,a\n   - Row 4: ,b,e,,f,a,d\n   - Row 5: b,e,c,,,d,g\n   - Row 6: ,,,,d,g,\n   - Row 7: ,,a,,,,\n\n3. **Determine the letter for the minor diagonal**: \n   - The minor diagonal positions are (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0).\n   - Check these positions in the pre-filled grid:\n     - (0,6) is empty\n     - (1,5) is empty\n     - (2,4) is 'c'\n     - (3,3) is empty\n     - (4,2) is 'c'\n     - (5,1) is empty\n     - (6,0) is empty\n   - Since (2,4) and (4,2) are both 'c', the minor diagonal must be filled with 'c'.\n\n4. **Fill the grid**:\n   - Fill the minor diagonal with 'c'.\n   - Ensure each row and column contains each letter exactly once.\n\n5. **Complete the grid**:\n   - Use the constraints to fill in the remaining cells, ensuring each row and column contains each letter exactly once.\n\nAfter filling in the grid, the solution is:\n\n<<<\nc,a,f,g,b,e,d\na,d,g,f,e,c,b\nd,c,b,e,c,f,a\ng,b,e,c,f,a,d\nb,e,c,a,d,g,f\nf,g,d,b,c,g,e\ne,f,a,d,g,b,c\n>>>"
