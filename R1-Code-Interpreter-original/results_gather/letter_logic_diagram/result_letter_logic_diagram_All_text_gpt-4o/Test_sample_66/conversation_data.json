    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill the 7x7 grid with the letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} such that each row and each column contains exactly one of each letter, and all cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter.\n\nLet's analyze the given grid and constraints step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Minor Diagonal:**\n   - The minor diagonal consists of the following cells: (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0).\n   - All these cells must contain the same letter.\n\n2. **Fill the Minor Diagonal:**\n   - We need to choose a letter that can fit into all these positions without violating the row and column constraints.\n   - After examining the grid, we can choose 'f' for the minor diagonal because it fits without conflict.\n\n3. **Fill the Grid:**\n   - Start filling the grid row by row, ensuring each row and column contains all letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} exactly once.\n   - Use the pre-filled letters as constraints to guide the filling process.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Filling:**\n   - **Row 1:** Already has 'c' and 'e'. Fill with 'a', 'b', 'd', 'f', 'g'.\n   - **Row 2:** Already has 'c', 'e', 'd'. Fill with 'a', 'b', 'f', 'g'.\n   - **Row 3:** Already has 'a', 'b', 'f', 'c'. Fill with 'd', 'e', 'g'.\n   - **Row 4:** Already has 'c', 'a'. Fill with 'b', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g'.\n   - **Row 5:** Already has 'b', 'g', 'd'. Fill with 'a', 'c', 'e', 'f'.\n   - **Row 6:** Already has 'g', 'e', 'b'. Fill with 'a', 'c', 'd', 'f'.\n   - **Row 7:** Already has 'c', 'e'. Fill with 'a', 'b', 'd', 'f', 'g'.\n\n5. **Ensure Column Constraints:**\n   - After filling each row, check each column to ensure it contains all letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} exactly once.\n\n6. **Final Check:**\n   - Verify that all constraints are satisfied: each row and column contains all letters exactly once, and the minor diagonal contains the same letter.\n\nFollowing these steps, the completed grid is:\n\n<<<\na,c,f,e,g,b,d\nc,f,e,g,a,b,d\na,d,b,f,g,e,c\nf,g,d,b,e,c,a\nb,e,g,d,f,a,c\ng,f,a,c,e,d,b\nd,b,c,f,e,g,a\n>>>"
