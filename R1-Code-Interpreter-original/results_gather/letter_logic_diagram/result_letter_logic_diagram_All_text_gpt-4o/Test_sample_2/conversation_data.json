    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill in the missing letters in the 7x7 grid while adhering to the given constraints. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - Each row must contain each letter from {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} exactly once.\n   - Each column must contain each letter from {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} exactly once.\n   - All cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) must contain the same letter.\n\n2. **Identify the Minor Diagonal:**\n   - The minor diagonal consists of the following positions: (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0).\n\n3. **Analyze the Given Grid:**\n   ```\n   ,b,,f,g,,c\n   b,e,,,a,c,\n   ,f,g,a,c,,b\n   f,,a,,d,,e\n   g,,,d,,e,f\n   a,,,,,f,g\n   c,d,,e,,g,a\n   ```\n\n4. **Determine the Letter for the Minor Diagonal:**\n   - Check the pre-filled cells on the minor diagonal: (0,6) = c, (1,5) = c, (2,4) = c, (3,3) = d, (4,2) = d, (5,1) = d, (6,0) = c.\n   - The letter on the minor diagonal must be consistent. Since there are more 'c's than 'd's, and 'c' is already in the majority of the diagonal, we choose 'c' for the entire diagonal.\n\n5. **Fill the Grid:**\n   - Start by filling the minor diagonal with 'c'.\n   - Use the constraints to fill in the rest of the grid, ensuring each row and column contains each letter exactly once.\n\n6. **Step-by-Step Filling:**\n   - Fill in the missing letters in each row and column, checking against the constraints.\n   - Adjust as necessary to ensure all constraints are met.\n\n7. **Final Solution:**\n   ```\n   a,b,d,f,g,e,c\n   b,e,f,g,a,c,d\n   d,f,g,a,c,e,b\n   f,c,a,c,d,b,e\n   g,a,c,d,b,e,f\n   a,c,b,g,e,f,g\n   c,d,e,e,f,g,a\n   ```\n\nThe final filled grid is:\n<<<\na,b,d,f,g,e,c\nb,e,f,g,a,c,d\nd,f,g,a,c,e,b\nf,c,a,c,d,b,e\ng,a,c,d,b,e,f\na,c,b,g,e,f,g\nc,d,e,e,f,g,a\n>>>"
