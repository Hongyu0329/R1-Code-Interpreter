    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill in the 7x7 grid with the letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} such that each row and each column contains each letter exactly once, and all cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter.\n\nLet's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the minor diagonal**: The minor diagonal consists of the following cells:\n   - (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0).\n\n2. **Determine the letter for the minor diagonal**: \n   - Check the pre-filled cells on the minor diagonal. The cell (5,1) is pre-filled with 'e'.\n   - Therefore, all cells on the minor diagonal must be 'e'.\n\n3. **Fill the minor diagonal with 'e'**:\n   - (0,6) = e\n   - (1,5) = e\n   - (2,4) = e\n   - (3,3) = e\n   - (4,2) = e\n   - (5,1) = e (already filled)\n   - (6,0) = e\n\n4. **Fill the rest of the grid**:\n   - For each row and column, ensure that each letter {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} appears exactly once.\n   - Use the process of elimination and logical deduction to fill in the remaining cells.\n\nLet's fill in the grid:\n\n- **Row 1**: b,,,,g,,e\n  - Missing letters: a, c, d, f\n  - Fill: b,a,c,d,g,f,e\n\n- **Row 2**: ,,a,g,,,\n  - Missing letters: b, c, d, e, f\n  - Fill: c,f,a,g,d,b,e\n\n- **Row 3**: f,a,,,,b,d\n  - Missing letters: c, e, g\n  - Fill: f,a,g,c,e,b,d\n\n- **Row 4**: ,g,,,,,\n  - Missing letters: a, b, c, d, e, f\n  - Fill: d,g,f,a,e,c,b\n\n- **Row 5**: g,,,b,,,\n  - Missing letters: a, c, d, e, f\n  - Fill: g,d,c,b,f,a,e\n\n- **Row 6**: ,e,b,d,f,a,\n  - Missing letters: c, g\n  - Fill: c,e,b,d,f,a,g\n\n- **Row 7**: ,b,,,a,,\n  - Missing letters: c, d, e, f, g\n  - Fill: e,b,f,c,a,g,d\n\nNow, let's present the final filled grid:\n\n<<<\nb,a,c,d,g,f,e\nc,f,a,g,d,b,e\nf,a,g,c,e,b,d\nd,g,f,a,e,c,b\ng,d,c,b,f,a,e\nc,e,b,d,f,a,g\ne,b,f,c,a,g,d\n>>>"
