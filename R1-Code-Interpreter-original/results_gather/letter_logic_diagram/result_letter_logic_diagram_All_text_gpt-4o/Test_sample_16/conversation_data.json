    "To solve this puzzle, we need to fill the 7x7 grid with the letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} such that each row and each column contains exactly one of each letter, and all cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter.\n\nLet's analyze the given grid and constraints step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the Minor Diagonal**: The minor diagonal consists of the following cells:\n   - (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,0)\n\n2. **Determine the Letter for the Minor Diagonal**: \n   - The minor diagonal must contain the same letter. We need to check which letter can fit into all these positions without violating the row and column constraints.\n\n3. **Fill the Grid**:\n   - Start by filling the minor diagonal with a letter that can fit all positions.\n   - Then, fill the rest of the grid by ensuring each row and column contains all letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} exactly once.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Filling**:\n   - **Row 1**: Already has g, c, e, a. Needs b, d, f.\n   - **Row 2**: Already has g, b. Needs a, c, d, e, f.\n   - **Row 3**: Already has c, e. Needs a, b, d, f, g.\n   - **Row 4**: Already has b, e, a, g, d. Needs c, f.\n   - **Row 5**: Already has g, b. Needs a, c, d, e, f.\n   - **Row 6**: Already has d, b. Needs a, c, e, f, g.\n   - **Row 7**: Already has d, b. Needs a, c, e, f, g.\n\n5. **Fill the Minor Diagonal**:\n   - Choose a letter that can fit into all positions of the minor diagonal without conflicting with existing letters in those rows and columns. After checking, the letter 'f' can fit all positions of the minor diagonal.\n\n6. **Complete the Grid**:\n   - Fill in the remaining cells by ensuring each row and column contains all letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} exactly once.\n\nAfter carefully filling the grid, the solution is:\n\n<<<\nf,g,d,f,c,e,a\ng,f,b,a,f,c,e\na,c,f,e,g,d,b\nb,f,e,a,f,g,d\nc,a,g,f,e,d,b\ne,d,f,c,b,a,g\nd,e,c,b,f,g,a\n>>>"
