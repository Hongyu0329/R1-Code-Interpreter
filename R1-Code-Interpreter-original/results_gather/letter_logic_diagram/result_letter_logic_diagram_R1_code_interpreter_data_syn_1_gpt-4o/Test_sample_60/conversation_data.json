    "To solve this problem, we need to fill the 7x7 grid such that each row and each column contains exactly one of each letter from 'a' to 'g', and all cells on the minor diagonal contain the same letter. \n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Minor Diagonal**: The minor diagonal consists of cells (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), and (6,0). All these cells must contain the same letter.\n\n2. **Fill the Grid**: We will fill the grid by ensuring each row and column contains all letters from 'a' to 'g' exactly once, while also ensuring the minor diagonal condition is met.\n\n3. **Backtracking Approach**: We can use a backtracking algorithm to try filling the grid. If we encounter a conflict (a letter is repeated in a row or column), we backtrack and try a different letter.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef is_valid(grid, row, col, letter):\n    # Check if the letter is already in the row or column\n    for i in range(7):\n        if grid[row][i] == letter or grid[i][col] == letter:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef solve(grid, minor_diagonal_letter):\n    def backtrack(row, col):\n        if row == 7:\n            return True\n        if col == 7:\n            return backtrack(row + 1, 0)\n        if grid[row][col] != '':\n            return backtrack(row, col + 1)\n        \n        for letter in 'abcdefg':\n            if (row + col == 6 and letter != minor_diagonal_letter) or not is_valid(grid, row, col, letter):\n                continue\n            grid[row][col] = letter\n            if backtrack(row, col + 1):\n                return True\n            grid[row][col] = ''\n        return False\n\n    return backtrack(0, 0)\n\n# Initial grid setup\ngrid = [\n    ['', 'c', 'g', 'd', 'b', '', ''],\n    ['', '', 'd', 'b', '', '', ''],\n    ['', 'd', '', '', '', '', ''],\n    ['', 'b', '', '', '', 'c', ''],\n    ['b', 'e', '', 'a', 'c', '', 'd'],\n    ['e', '', '', '', '', 'd', ''],\n    ['f', '', '', 'g', 'd', '', '']\n]\n\n# Try each letter for the minor diagonal\nfor letter in 'abcdefg':\n    if solve(grid, letter):\n        for row in grid:\n            print(','.join(row))\n        break\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to fill the grid by trying each letter for the minor diagonal and using backtracking to fill the rest of the grid. Let's execute this code to find the solution.",
