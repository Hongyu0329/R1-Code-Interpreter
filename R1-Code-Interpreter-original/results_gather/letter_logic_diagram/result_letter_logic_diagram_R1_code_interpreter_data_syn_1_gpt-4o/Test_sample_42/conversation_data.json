    "To solve this problem, we need to fill the 7x7 grid such that each row and each column contains exactly one of each letter from 'a' to 'g', and all cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the minor diagonal**: The minor diagonal consists of the cells (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), and (6,0).\n\n2. **Determine the letter for the minor diagonal**: Since all cells on the minor diagonal must contain the same letter, we need to find a letter that can fit into all these positions without violating the row and column constraints.\n\n3. **Fill the grid**: Once the minor diagonal is filled, we can fill the rest of the grid by ensuring each row and column contains all letters from 'a' to 'g'.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_puzzle(grid):\n    from collections import Counter\n    \n    # Function to check if a letter can be placed at a given position\n    def can_place(letter, row, col):\n        # Check row\n        if letter in grid[row]:\n            return False\n        # Check column\n        for r in range(7):\n            if grid[r][col] == letter:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    # Fill the minor diagonal with a letter that can fit all positions\n    minor_diagonal_positions = [(0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 1), (6, 0)]\n    for letter in 'abcdefg':\n        if all(can_place(letter, r, c) for r, c in minor_diagonal_positions):\n            for r, c in minor_diagonal_positions:\n                grid[r][c] = letter\n            break\n\n    # Fill the rest of the grid\n    for r in range(7):\n        for c in range(7):\n            if grid[r][c] == '':\n                for letter in 'abcdefg':\n                    if can_place(letter, r, c):\n                        grid[r][c] = letter\n                        break\n\n    return grid\n\n# Initial grid setup\ngrid = [\n    ['', 'b', '', '', 'g', 'd', 'c'],\n    ['', 'a', 'f', 'g', '', 'c', 'e'],\n    ['a', 'f', '', '', 'c', 'e', 'b'],\n    ['', 'g', 'd', '', 'e', '', ''],\n    ['g', 'd', 'c', 'e', 'b', '', 'f'],\n    ['', 'c', 'e', '', 'a', '', ''],\n    ['', '', 'b', 'a', 'f', '', '']\n]\n\n# Solve the puzzle\nsolved_grid = solve_puzzle(grid)\n\n# Format the output\nfor row in solved_grid:\n    print(','.join(row))\n```\n\nThis code will fill the grid according to the given constraints and print the solution.
