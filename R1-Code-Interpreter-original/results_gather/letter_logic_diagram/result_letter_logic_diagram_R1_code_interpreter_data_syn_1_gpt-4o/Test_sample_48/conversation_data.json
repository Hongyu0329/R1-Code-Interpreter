    "To solve this problem, we need to fill in the missing letters in the 7x7 grid while adhering to the constraints:\n\n1. Each row must contain each letter from 'a' to 'g' exactly once.\n2. Each column must contain each letter from 'a' to 'g' exactly once.\n3. All cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) must contain the same letter.\n\nLet's first analyze the given grid and identify the missing letters in each row and column. Then, we will use a backtracking approach to fill in the grid while satisfying all the constraints.\n\nHere's the initial grid with empty cells represented by underscores for clarity:\n\n```\nf, d, _, _, _, c, g\nd, e, _, a, c, _, f\ne, b, _, _, g, f, _\n_, _, c, g, f, _, e\na, c, g, f, d, e, b\n_, g, _, d, e, _, a\ng, f, _, e, b, a, c\n```\n\nThe minor diagonal cells are at positions (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), and (6,0).
