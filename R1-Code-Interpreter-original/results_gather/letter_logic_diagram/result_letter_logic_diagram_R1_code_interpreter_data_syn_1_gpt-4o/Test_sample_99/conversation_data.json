    "To solve this problem, we need to fill the 7x7 grid such that each row and each column contains exactly one of each letter from 'a' to 'g', and all cells on the minor diagonal contain the same letter. \n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Minor Diagonal**: The minor diagonal consists of cells (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), and (6,0). All these cells must contain the same letter.\n\n2. **Fill the Grid**: We need to fill the grid while ensuring that each row and column contains all letters from 'a' to 'g' exactly once.\n\n3. **Constraints**: \n   - The minor diagonal must have the same letter.\n   - Pre-filled cells must remain unchanged.\n\n4. **Backtracking Approach**: We can use a backtracking algorithm to try filling the grid, ensuring that all constraints are satisfied.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef is_valid(grid, row, col, char):\n    # Check if char is not in the current row\n    if char in grid[row]:\n        return False\n    # Check if char is not in the current column\n    for r in range(7):\n        if grid[r][col] == char:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef solve(grid, minor_diagonal_char):\n    def backtrack(row, col):\n        if row == 7:\n            return True\n        if col == 7:\n            return backtrack(row + 1, 0)\n        if grid[row][col] != '':\n            return backtrack(row, col + 1)\n        \n        for char in 'abcdefg':\n            if (row + col == 6 and char != minor_diagonal_char) or not is_valid(grid, row, col, char):\n                continue\n            grid[row][col] = char\n            if backtrack(row, col + 1):\n                return True\n            grid[row][col] = ''\n        return False\n\n    return backtrack(0, 0)\n\n# Initial grid setup\ngrid = [\n    ['', '', 'b', '', '', 'd', 'a'],\n    ['', '', 'e', '', 'd', '', 'g'],\n    ['', 'e', 'c', 'd', '', '', ''],\n    ['', 'c', '', '', '', '', ''],\n    ['', 'd', 'a', '', 'f', '', 'e'],\n    ['', '', 'g', '', '', '', ''],\n    ['', '', 'f', '', 'e', 'c', 'd']\n]\n\n# Try each letter for the minor diagonal\nfor char in 'abcdefg':\n    # Copy the grid to try with a new minor diagonal character\n    test_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    # Set the minor diagonal\n    for i in range(7):\n        test_grid[i][6-i] = char\n    if solve(test_grid, char):\n        for row in test_grid:\n            print(','.join(row))\n        break\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to fill the grid by trying each letter for the minor diagonal and using backtracking to fill the rest of the grid. The solution will be printed once found.",
