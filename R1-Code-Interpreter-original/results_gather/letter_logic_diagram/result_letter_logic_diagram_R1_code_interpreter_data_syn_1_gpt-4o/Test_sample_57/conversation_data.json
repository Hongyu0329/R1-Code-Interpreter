    "To solve this problem, we need to fill the 7x7 grid with the letters {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} such that each row and each column contains exactly one of each letter, and all cells on the minor diagonal contain the same letter.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the minor diagonal**: The minor diagonal consists of the cells (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), and (6,0). All these cells must contain the same letter.\n\n2. **Fill the grid**: We will fill the grid by ensuring each row and column contains all letters from {a, b, c, d, e, f, g} exactly once, while also ensuring the minor diagonal constraint is satisfied.\n\n3. **Use backtracking**: We can use a backtracking algorithm to try filling the grid, checking at each step if the current configuration is valid.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef is_valid(grid, row, col, letter):\n    # Check if the letter is already in the row or column\n    for i in range(7):\n        if grid[row][i] == letter or grid[i][col] == letter:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef solve(grid, minor_diagonal_letter, row=0, col=0):\n    if row == 7:\n        return True  # All rows are filled\n\n    if col == 7:\n        return solve(grid, minor_diagonal_letter, row + 1, 0)  # Move to the next row\n\n    if grid[row][col] != '':\n        return solve(grid, minor_diagonal_letter, row, col + 1)  # Skip pre-filled cells\n\n    # Determine if this cell is on the minor diagonal\n    if row + col == 6:\n        if is_valid(grid, row, col, minor_diagonal_letter):\n            grid[row][col] = minor_diagonal_letter\n            if solve(grid, minor_diagonal_letter, row, col + 1):\n                return True\n            grid[row][col] = ''  # Backtrack\n    else:\n        for letter in 'abcdefg':\n            if is_valid(grid, row, col, letter):\n                grid[row][col] = letter\n                if solve(grid, minor_diagonal_letter, row, col + 1):\n                    return True\n                grid[row][col] = ''  # Backtrack\n\n    return False\n\n# Initial grid setup\ngrid = [\n    ['', '', 'd', 'e', 'a', '', ''],\n    ['', '', '', '', '', '', ''],\n    ['', '', 'a', '', '', 'f', 'g'],\n    ['', '', '', 'b', '', 'g', 'd'],\n    ['', 'c', '', '', '', 'd', 'e'],\n    ['c', '', 'f', '', '', '', 'a'],\n    ['', 'f', 'g', '', 'e', '', 'c']\n]\n\n# Try each letter for the minor diagonal\nfor letter in 'abcdefg':\n    if solve(grid, letter):\n        for row in grid:\n            print(','.join(row))\n        break\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to fill the grid by trying each letter for the minor diagonal and using backtracking to fill the rest of the grid. Let's execute this code to find the solution.",
