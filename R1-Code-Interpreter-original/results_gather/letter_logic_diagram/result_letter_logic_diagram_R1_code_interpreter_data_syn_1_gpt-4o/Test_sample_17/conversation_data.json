    "To solve this problem, we need to fill the 7x7 grid such that each row and each column contains exactly one of each letter from 'a' to 'g', and all cells on the minor diagonal contain the same letter. \n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the minor diagonal**: The minor diagonal consists of cells (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), and (6,0).
