    "To solve this problem, we need to fill the 7x7 grid such that each row and each column contains exactly one of each letter from 'a' to 'g', and all cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Minor Diagonal**: The minor diagonal consists of the cells (0,6), (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), and (6,0). All these cells must contain the same letter.\n\n2. **Determine the Missing Letters**: For each row and column, determine which letters are missing.\n\n3. **Fill the Grid**: Use backtracking to fill the grid, ensuring that each row and column contains all letters from 'a' to 'g' and that the minor diagonal constraint is satisfied.\n\n4. **Check Constraints**: Ensure that the filled grid satisfies all the constraints.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ndef is_valid(grid, row, col, letter):\n    # Check if the letter is already in the row or column\n    for i in range(7):\n        if grid[row][i] == letter or grid[i][col] == letter:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef solve(grid, minor_diagonal_letter, row=0, col=0):\n    if row == 7:\n        return True\n    if col == 7:\n        return solve(grid, minor_diagonal_letter, row + 1, 0)\n    if grid[row][col] != '':\n        return solve(grid, minor_diagonal_letter, row, col + 1)\n    \n    for letter in 'abcdefg':\n        if (row + col == 6 and letter != minor_diagonal_letter) or not is_valid(grid, row, col, letter):\n            continue\n        grid[row][col] = letter\n        if solve(grid, minor_diagonal_letter, row, col + 1):\n            return True\n        grid[row][col] = ''\n    return False\n\n# Initial grid setup\ngrid = [\n    ['b', '', '', '', 'g', '', 'e'],\n    ['', '', 'a', 'g', '', '', ''],\n    ['f', 'a', '', '', '', 'b', 'd'],\n    ['', 'g', '', '', '', '', ''],\n    ['g', '', '', 'b', '', '', ''],\n    ['', 'e', 'b', 'd', 'f', 'a', ''],\n    ['', 'b', '', '', 'a', '', '']\n]\n\n# Try each letter for the minor diagonal\nfor letter in 'abcdefg':\n    if solve(grid, letter):\n        break\n\n# Print the solution\nfor row in grid:\n    print(','.join(row))\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to fill the grid by trying each letter for the minor diagonal and using backtracking to ensure all constraints are met. Let's execute this code to find the solution.",
