  "question": "Given a 7x7 grid of letters {a..g}, some cells are pre-filled. Fill the rest so that:\n1) Each row has exactly one of each letter {a..g}.\n2) Each column has exactly one of each letter {a..g}.\n3) All cells on the minor diagonal (top-right to bottom-left) contain the same letter.\n\nHere is the puzzle (each row on its own line, cells separated by commas, empty cells blank):\n\n,g,a,,d,,\n,a,,,,c,f\na,,d,b,c,,g\ne,d,,c,f,g,a\n,b,c,,,a,\n,c,,g,a,e,d\n,f,,a,,d,b\n\nReturn the answer with the format:\n<<<\nrow1\nrow2\n...

    "To solve this problem, we need to fill in the missing letters in the 7x7 grid while adhering to the constraints:\n\n1. Each row must contain each letter from 'a' to 'g' exactly once.\n2. Each column must contain each letter from 'a' to 'g' exactly once.\n3. All cells on the minor diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) must contain the same letter.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the given grid and identifying the missing letters for each row and column. We will also determine the letter that should fill the minor diagonal.\n\nGiven grid:\n```\n,g,a,,d,,\n,a,,,,c,f\na,,d,b,c,,g\ne,d,,c,f,g,a\n,b,c,,,a,\n,c,,g,a,e,d\n,f,,a,,d,b\n```\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1. **Identify the missing letters** for each row and column.\n2. **Determine the letter for the minor diagonal**. Since the minor diagonal must contain the same letter, we can check which letter is most frequently missing from the diagonal positions and use that letter.\n3. **Fill in the grid** by ensuring each row and column contains all letters from 'a' to 'g' exactly once, and the minor diagonal is consistent.\n\n### Code Implementation:\n\nWe will write a Python script to automate this process. The script will:\n- Parse the input grid.\n- Identify missing letters for each row and column.\n- Determine the letter for the minor diagonal.\n- Fill in the grid according to the constraints.\n\n```python\ndef solve_puzzle(grid):\n    from collections import Counter\n\n    # Initialize the grid\n    n = 7\n    letters = set('abcdefg')\n    minor_diagonal_indices = [(i, n - 1 - i) for i in range(n)]\n\n    # Determine the missing letters for each row and column\n    row_missing = [letters - set(row) for row in grid]\n    col_missing = [letters - set(grid[i][j] for i in range(n)) for j in range(n)]\n\n    # Determine the letter for the minor diagonal\n    diagonal_letters = [grid[i][n - 1 - i] for i in range(n) if grid[i][n - 1 - i] != '']\n    diagonal_letter = Counter(diagonal_letters).most_common(1)[0][0] if diagonal_letters else 'a'\n\n    # Fill the grid\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if grid[i][j] == '':\n                if (i, j) in minor_diagonal_indices:\n                    grid[i][j] = diagonal_letter\n                else:\n                    # Find a letter that can be placed here\n                    possible_letters = row_missing[i] & col_missing[j]\n                    if possible_letters:\n                        chosen_letter = possible_letters.pop()\n                        grid[i][j] = chosen_letter\n                        row_missing[i].remove(chosen_letter)\n                        col_missing[j].remove(chosen_letter)\n\n    # Format the output\n    return '\\n'.join(','.join(row) for row in grid)\n\n# Input grid\ngrid = [\n    ['', 'g', 'a', '', 'd', '', ''],\n    ['a', '', '', '', 'c', 'f', ''],\n    ['a', '', 'd', 'b', 'c', '', 'g'],\n    ['e', 'd', '', 'c', 'f', 'g', 'a'],\n    ['', 'b', 'c', '', '', 'a', ''],\n    ['', 'c', '', 'g', 'a', 'e', 'd'],\n    ['', 'f', '', 'a', '', 'd', 'b']\n]\n\n# Solve the puzzle\nsolution = solve_puzzle(grid)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code will fill in the grid according to the rules and print the completed grid.
