    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the given numbers to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K such that all the given inequalities and equations are satisfied. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the given numbers**: 3, 9, 16, 27, 36, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225.\n\n2. **List the equations and inequalities**:\n   - F = 4.0C\n   - J - A = -48\n   - K - B = -75\n   - J > C\n   - B = 3.0A\n   - B + C = 234\n   - F + J = 63\n   - H + K = 271\n   - A - I = 59\n   - C = 3.0E\n\n3. **Solve the equations step by step**:\n   - From equation 5, B = 3A. The possible pairs (A, B) from the given numbers are (3, 9).\n   - From equation 9, A - I = 59. If A = 3, then I = 3 - 59 = -56, which is not possible. So, A must be 75, and I = 16.\n   - From equation 5, if A = 75, then B = 3 * 75 = 225.\n   - From equation 3, K - B = -75. If B = 225, then K = 225 - 75 = 150.\n   - From equation 8, H + K = 271. If K = 150, then H = 271 - 150 = 121.\n   - From equation 6, B + C = 234. If B = 225, then C = 234 - 225 = 9.\n   - From equation 1, F = 4.0C. If C = 9, then F = 4 * 9 = 36.\n   - From equation 7, F + J = 63. If F = 36, then J = 63 - 36 = 27.\n   - From equation 2, J - A = -48. If J = 27, then A = 27 + 48 = 75, which is consistent.\n   - From equation 10, C = 3.0E. If C = 9, then E = 9 / 3 = 3.\n\n4. **Assign the remaining numbers**: The numbers 48 and 80 are left. Since G is not involved in any equation, we can assign G = 48.\n\n5. **Verify all conditions**: All conditions are satisfied with the assignments.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the values in alphabetical order:\n\n```python\n# Assigning the values based on the solution\nA = 75\nB = 225\nC = 9\nD = 48  # D is not involved in any equation, so we assign one of the remaining numbers\nE = 3\nF = 36\nG = 48  # G is not involved in any equation, so we assign one of the remaining numbers\nH = 121\nI = 16\nJ = 27\nK = 150\n\n# Output the values in alphabetical order\nresult = [A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K]\nprint(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the values of the letters in alphabetical order, satisfying all the given conditions.",

SymPy can help us solve systems of equations and inequalities more efficiently.

It assigns the remaining numbers to D and G, which are not involved in any equations, and outputs the result in alphabetical order.",
