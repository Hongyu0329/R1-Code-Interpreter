    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the given numbers to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K such that all the given inequalities are satisfied. We will use a systematic approach to solve the equations step by step.\n\n### Plan:\n1. **Identify the numbers**: The numbers to be assigned are 3, 9, 16, 27, 36, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225.\n2. **Use the equations to find relationships**:\n   - From equation 10, \\( F = 3.0I \\), we can deduce that \\( F \\) and \\( I \\) must be such that \\( F \\) is three times \\( I \\).\n   - From equation 6, \\( F - A = -216 \\), we can deduce that \\( A = F + 216 \\).\n   - From equation 3, \\( A = 3.0D \\), we can deduce that \\( A \\) is three times \\( D \\).\n   - From equation 9, \\( A + B = 346 \\), we can deduce that \\( B = 346 - A \\).\n   - From equation 1, \\( C - I = 13 \\), we can deduce that \\( C = I + 13 \\).\n   - From equation 2, \\( G - I = 147 \\), we can deduce that \\( G = I + 147 \\).\n   - From equation 4, \\( G + J = 186 \\), we can deduce that \\( J = 186 - G \\).\n   - From equation 5, \\( D + H = 123 \\), we can deduce that \\( H = 123 - D \\).\n   - From equation 7, \\( H + J = 84 \\), we can deduce that \\( J = 84 - H \\).\n   - From equation 8, \\( F + G = 159 \\), we can deduce that \\( G = 159 - F \\).\n\n3. **Solve the equations**: Use the above relationships to solve for each letter.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the values for each letter.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# The numbers to be assigned\nnumbers = [3, 9, 16, 27, 36, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225]\n\n# Iterate over all permutations of the numbers\nfor perm in permutations(numbers):\n    A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K = perm\n    \n    # Check all conditions\n    if (C - I == 13 and\n        G - I == 147 and\n        A == 3 * D and\n        G + J == 186 and\n        D + H == 123 and\n        F - A == -216 and\n        H + J == 84 and\n        F + G == 159 and\n        A + B == 346 and\n        F == 3 * I):\n        \n        # If all conditions are satisfied, print the result\n        print(f\"<<<[{A}, {B}, {C}, {D}, {E}, {F}, {G}, {H}, {I}, {J}, {K}]>>>\")\n        break\n```\n\nThis code will iterate over all permutations of the given numbers and check if they satisfy all the given inequalities. Once it finds a valid assignment, it will print the values in the required format."
