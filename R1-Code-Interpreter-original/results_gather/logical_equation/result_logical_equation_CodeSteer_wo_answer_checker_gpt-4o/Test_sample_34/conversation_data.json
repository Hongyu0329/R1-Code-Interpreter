    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the given numbers to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K such that all the given inequalities are satisfied. We will use a step-by-step approach to find the values for each letter.\n\n### Plan:\n1. **Identify Direct Relationships**: Start with equations that directly relate two variables.\n   - From equation 1: \\( G = 3.0C \\)\n   - From equation 2: \\( I = 4.0G \\)\n   - From equation 4: \\( K = 3.0J \\)\n   - From equation 7: \\( F = 2.0J \\)\n   - From equation 8: \\( F - C = 147 \\)\n\n2. **Substitute and Solve**: Use the direct relationships to substitute and solve for other variables.\n   - From equation 3: \\( A - G = 112 \\)\n   - From equation 5: \\( B + D = 64 \\)\n   - From equation 6: \\( E - B = 11 \\)\n   - From equation 9: \\( E - I = -9 \\)\n   - From equation 10: \\( A + F = 271 \\)\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Values**: Use the given numbers and iterate over possible values to satisfy all equations.\n\n4. **Check All Conditions**: Ensure that all conditions are satisfied with the chosen values.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Given numbers\nnumbers = [3, 9, 16, 27, 36, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225]\n\n# Iterate over all permutations of the numbers\nfor perm in permutations(numbers):\n    A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K = perm\n    \n    # Check all conditions\n    if (G == 3.0 * C and\n        I == 4.0 * G and\n        A - G == 112 and\n        K == 3.0 * J and\n        B + D == 64 and\n        E - B == 11 and\n        F == 2.0 * J and\n        F - C == 147 and\n        E - I == -9 and\n        A + F == 271):\n        \n        # If all conditions are satisfied, print the result\n        print(f\"<<<[{A}, {B}, {C}, {D}, {E}, {F}, {G}, {H}, {I}, {J}, {K}]>>>\")\n        break\n```\n\nThis code will iterate over all permutations of the given numbers and check if they satisfy all the given inequalities. Once it finds a valid solution, it will print the values in the required format."
