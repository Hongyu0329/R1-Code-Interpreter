    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the given numbers to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K such that all the inequalities and equations are satisfied. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers**: The numbers to be assigned are 3, 9, 16, 20, 39, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, and 225.\n\n2. **Analyze the equations and inequalities**:\n   - From equation 2: \\( D - A = 66 \\), we can deduce that \\( D = A + 66 \\).\n   - From equation 3: \\( F - G = -145 \\), we can deduce that \\( F = G - 145 \\).\n   - From equation 4: \\( B - G = -209 \\), we can deduce that \\( B = G - 209 \\).\n   - From equation 5: \\( E = 3.0B \\).\n   - From equation 6: \\( I - A = 112 \\), we can deduce that \\( I = A + 112 \\).\n   - From equation 8: \\( A + H = 159 \\), we can deduce that \\( H = 159 - A \\).\n   - From equation 9: \\( D + H = 225 \\).\n   - From equation 10: \\( E = 2.4J \\).\n   - From equation 11: \\( A - H = -141 \\).\n\n3. **Solve the equations**:\n   - From equations 8 and 11, we can solve for \\( A \\) and \\( H \\):\n     - \\( A + H = 159 \\)\n     - \\( A - H = -141 \\)\n     - Adding these two equations: \\( 2A = 18 \\) → \\( A = 9 \\)\n     - Substituting \\( A = 9 \\) into \\( A + H = 159 \\): \\( 9 + H = 159 \\) → \\( H = 150 \\)\n\n4. **Substitute \\( A = 9 \\) into other equations**:\n   - From \\( D = A + 66 \\): \\( D = 9 + 66 = 75 \\)\n   - From \\( I = A + 112 \\): \\( I = 9 + 112 = 121 \\)\n\n5. **Use the remaining numbers and equations**:\n   - Numbers left: 3, 16, 20, 39, 48, 80, 225\n   - From \\( D + H = 225 \\): \\( 75 + 150 = 225 \\) (satisfied)\n   - From \\( F = G - 145 \\) and \\( B = G - 209 \\), we need to find \\( G \\), \\( F \\), and \\( B \\) such that these equations hold and the numbers match.\n   - From \\( E = 3.0B \\) and \\( E = 2.4J \\), we need to find \\( B \\), \\( E \\), and \\( J \\) such that these equations hold and the numbers match.\n\n6. **Assign remaining numbers**:\n   - \\( B = 16 \\), \\( E = 48 \\), \\( J = 20 \\) (since \\( E = 3.0 \\times 16 = 48 \\) and \\( E = 2.4 \\times 20 = 48 \\))\n   - \\( G = 225 \\), \\( F = 80 \\) (since \\( F = G - 145 = 80 \\) and \\( B = G - 209 = 16 \\))\n   - \\( C = 3 \\), \\( K = 39 \\) (remaining numbers)\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the values in alphabetical order:\n\n```python\n# Assign the values to the letters\nA = 9\nB = 16\nC = 3\nD = 75\nE = 48\nF = 80\nG = 225\nH = 150\nI = 121\nJ = 20\nK = 39\n\n# Create a list of values in alphabetical order\nresult = [A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n```",
