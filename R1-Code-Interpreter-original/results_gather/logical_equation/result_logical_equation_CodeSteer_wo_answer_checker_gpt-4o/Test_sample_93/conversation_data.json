    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the given numbers to the letters A through M such that all the inequalities and equations are satisfied. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the given numbers**: 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, 96.\n\n2. **List the equations and inequalities**:\n   - C + E = 141\n   - J + L = 33\n   - K = 2.4H\n   - B - J = 10\n   - E - C = 51\n   - C > F\n   - M = 3.2J\n   - E + K = 120\n   - J - H = -5\n   - K - B = 9\n   - B - M = -1\n   - C > M\n\n3. **Solve the equations and inequalities**:\n   - From E - C = 51, we have E = C + 51.\n   - From C + E = 141, substitute E = C + 51 to get C + (C + 51) = 141, which simplifies to 2C + 51 = 141. Solving for C gives C = 45.\n   - Substitute C = 45 into E = C + 51 to get E = 96.\n   - From E + K = 120, substitute E = 96 to get 96 + K = 120, which gives K = 24.\n   - From K = 2.4H, substitute K = 24 to get 24 = 2.4H, which gives H = 10.\n   - From J - H = -5, substitute H = 10 to get J - 10 = -5, which gives J = 5.\n   - From J + L = 33, substitute J = 5 to get 5 + L = 33, which gives L = 28.\n   - From M = 3.2J, substitute J = 5 to get M = 3.2 * 5, which gives M = 16.\n   - From B - J = 10, substitute J = 5 to get B - 5 = 10, which gives B = 15.\n   - From K - B = 9, substitute K = 24 and B = 15 to verify 24 - 15 = 9, which is correct.\n   - From B - M = -1, substitute B = 15 and M = 16 to verify 15 - 16 = -1, which is correct.\n   - From C > M, substitute C = 45 and M = 16 to verify 45 > 16, which is correct.\n   - From C > F, since C = 45, F must be less than 45. The remaining numbers are 2, 3, 7, 36, 50. The only number less than 45 is 36, so F = 36.\n\n4. **Assign the remaining numbers**:\n   - The remaining numbers are 2, 3, 7, 50.\n   - A, D, G, I are left to be assigned.\n   - Assign A = 2, D = 3, G = 7, I = 50.\n\n5. **Return the values in alphabetical order**.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the solution:\n\n```python\n# Assigning the values to the letters based on the solution\nA = 2\nB = 15\nC = 45\nD = 3\nE = 96\nF = 36\nG = 7\nH = 10\nI = 50\nJ = 5\nK = 24\nL = 28\nM = 16\n\n# Creating the list in alphabetical order\nresult = [A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M]\n\n# Printing the result in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n```",
