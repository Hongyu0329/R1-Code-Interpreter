    "The current approach using permutations is computationally expensive and results in a timeout. To improve the solution, consider using a more efficient algorithm that leverages symbolic computing and constraint satisfaction techniques. You can use libraries like SymPy to symbolically solve the equations and inequalities, or apply constraint programming with libraries like Python's `constraint` module or `z3-solver`. This will allow you to efficiently explore the solution space without exhaustively checking all permutations. Try to implement a solution using these advanced techniques.",
    "The current approach using the `z3-solver` is a step in the right direction for efficiently solving constraint satisfaction problems. However, the execution failed due to the absence of the `z3` module. To proceed, ensure that the `z3-solver` library is installed in your environment. You can install it using `pip install z3-solver`. Once installed, re-run the code to check for solutions. If the module cannot be installed, consider using another constraint-solving library available in your environment."
