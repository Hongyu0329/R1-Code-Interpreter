    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the given numbers to the letters A through M such that all the inequalities and equations are satisfied. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers**: The numbers to be assigned are 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, 96.\n\n2. **Analyze the equations and inequalities**:\n   - From equation 1: \\( L - I = -23 \\) implies \\( L = I - 23 \\).\n   - From equation 2: \\( I + M = 44 \\) implies \\( M = 44 - I \\).\n   - From equation 3: \\( D + K = 98 \\).\n   - From equation 4: \\( F + I = 73 \\) implies \\( F = 73 - I \\).\n   - From inequality 5: \\( F > J \\).\n   - From equation 6: \\( B - C = 26 \\) implies \\( B = C + 26 \\).\n   - From equation 7: \\( B = 2.4A \\).\n   - From equation 8: \\( C + F = 55 \\) implies \\( C = 55 - F \\).\n   - From equation 9: \\( F - J = 38 \\) implies \\( J = F - 38 \\).\n   - From equation 10: \\( H - F = 5 \\) implies \\( H = F + 5 \\).\n   - From equation 11: \\( J = 1.4L \\).\n\n3. **Solve the equations**:\n   - Start with equations that have direct relationships and fewer variables.\n   - Use substitution to find values for each letter.\n\n4. **Assign numbers to letters**:\n   - Use the constraints to assign the correct numbers to each letter.\n   - Ensure that all equations and inequalities are satisfied.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the solution:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbols for each letter\nA, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M = symbols('A B C D E F G H I J K L M')\n\n# Define the equations based on the problem statement\nequations = [\n    Eq(L - I, -23),\n    Eq(I + M, 44),\n    Eq(D + K, 98),\n    Eq(F + I, 73),\n    Eq(B - C, 26),\n    Eq(B, 2.4 * A),\n    Eq(C + F, 55),\n    Eq(F - J, 38),\n    Eq(H - F, 5),\n    Eq(J, 1.4 * L)\n]\n\n# Define the possible values\npossible_values = [2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, 96]\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve(equations, (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M), dict=True)\n\n# Filter the solution to match the possible values\nfor sol in solution:\n    if all(val in possible_values for val in sol.values()):\n        result = [sol[A], sol[B], sol[C], sol[D], sol[E], sol[F], sol[G], sol[H], sol[I], sol[J], sol[K], sol[L], sol[M]]\n        print(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n        break\n```\n\nThis code uses symbolic computation to solve the system of equations and checks if the solution matches the given set of possible values.

    "To solve this problem using a more robust approach, we can implement a backtracking algorithm. This algorithm will systematically assign values to each letter while checking all constraints. If a constraint is violated, the algorithm will backtrack and try a different assignment. Here's how we can implement this:\n\n1. **Define the constraints**: We need to ensure that all given equations and inequalities are satisfied.\n\n2. **Use backtracking**: Try assigning each number to a letter and check if the constraints are satisfied. If not, backtrack and try a different assignment.\n\n3. **Check all constraints**: Ensure that each assignment satisfies all the given equations and inequalities.\n\nLet's implement this approach in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Define the possible values\npossible_values = [2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, 96]\n\n# Define a function to check if a given assignment satisfies all constraints\ndef satisfies_constraints(assignment):\n    A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M = assignment\n    \n    # Check all constraints\n    if not (L - I == -23): return False\n    if not (I + M == 44): return False\n    if not (D + K == 98): return False\n    if not (F + I == 73): return False\n    if not (F > J): return False\n    if not (B - C == 26): return False\n    if not (B == 2.4 * A): return False\n    if not (C + F == 55): return False\n    if not (F - J == 38): return False\n    if not (H - F == 5): return False\n    if not (J == 1.4 * L): return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# Try all permutations of the possible values\nfor perm in permutations(possible_values):\n    if satisfies_constraints(perm):\n        print(f\"<<<{list(perm)}>>>\")\n        break\n```\n\nThis code uses permutations to try all possible assignments of the numbers to the letters. It checks each assignment against the constraints and prints the first valid assignment it finds. This approach ensures that all constraints are satisfied before printing the result.",
    "To optimize the search process, we can use a combination of constraint propagation and backtracking.
