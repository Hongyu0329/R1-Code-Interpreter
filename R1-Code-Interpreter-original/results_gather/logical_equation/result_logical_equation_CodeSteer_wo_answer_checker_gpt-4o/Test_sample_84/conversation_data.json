    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the given numbers to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and M such that all the given inequalities are satisfied. We will use a systematic approach to solve this:\n\n1. **Identify the relationships**: We have a set of equations and inequalities that relate the letters to each other. We will use these to find the values of the letters.\n\n2. **Substitute and solve**: Start by solving the equations that directly relate two variables, and substitute these into other equations to reduce the number of unknowns.\n\n3. **Check the constraints**: Ensure that the values satisfy all the given constraints.\n\n4. **Assign the numbers**: Once we have the relationships, we will assign the numbers to the letters based on the constraints.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n- From equation 1: \\( B = 1.4G \\)\n- From equation 2: \\( A = 3.2G \\)\n- From equation 3: \\( J = 3.0G \\)\n- From equation 4: \\( A = 1.6K \\) implies \\( K = \\frac{A}{1.6} \\)\n- From equation 5: \\( A + J = 31 \\)\n- From equation 6: \\( A + B = 23 \\)\n- From equation 7: \\( F = 2.4K \\)\n- From equation 8: \\( M - B = 89 \\)\n- From equation 9: \\( I - B = 43 \\)\n- From equation 10: \\( F = 4.8G \\)\n- From equation 11: \\( B = 3.5L \\)\n\nNow, let's solve these equations step by step:\n\n- From equation 5: \\( A + J = 31 \\) and equation 2 and 3, we have \\( 3.2G + 3.0G = 31 \\) which gives \\( G = 5 \\).\n- Substitute \\( G = 5 \\) into equations 1, 2, and 3:\n  - \\( B = 1.4 \\times 5 = 7 \\)\n  - \\( A = 3.2 \\times 5 = 16 \\)\n  - \\( J = 3.0 \\times 5 = 15 \\)\n- From equation 4: \\( A = 1.6K \\) gives \\( K = \\frac{16}{1.6} = 10 \\).\n- From equation 7: \\( F = 2.4K = 2.4 \\times 10 = 24 \\).\n- From equation 8: \\( M - B = 89 \\) gives \\( M = 89 + 7 = 96 \\).\n- From equation 9: \\( I - B = 43 \\) gives \\( I = 43 + 7 = 50 \\).\n- From equation 11: \\( B = 3.5L \\) gives \\( L = \\frac{7}{3.5} = 2 \\).\n\nNow, we have the values for A, B, F, G, I, J, K, L, and M. The remaining numbers are 3, 5, 28, 36, and 45, which we need to assign to C, D, E, and H.\n\nLet's assign these numbers to the remaining letters:\n\n- C = 3\n- D = 5\n- E = 28\n- H = 36\n\nNow, let's write the final Python code to print the values in alphabetical order:\n\n```python\n# Assign the calculated values to the letters\nA = 16\nB = 7\nC = 3\nD = 5\nE = 28\nF = 24\nG = 5\nH = 36\nI = 50\nJ = 15\nK = 10\nL = 2\nM = 96\n\n# Create a list of values in alphabetical order\nvalues = [A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M]\n\n# Print the list of values\nprint(f\"<<<{values}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will output the values of the letters in alphabetical order.",
    "To solve this problem more effectively, we can use the SymPy library in Python, which is designed for symbolic mathematics. This will allow us to handle the system of equations and inequalities symbolically and find a solution that satisfies all constraints. Here's the plan:\n\n1. **Define the variables**: Use SymPy to define symbolic variables for each letter.\n\n2. **Set up the equations**: Translate the given relationships and constraints into a system of equations using these symbolic variables.\n\n3. **Solve the equations**: Use SymPy's solving capabilities to find solutions that satisfy all the equations.\n\n4. **Assign numbers**: Use a search algorithm to assign the given numbers to the letters, ensuring that all constraints are satisfied.\n\n5. **Verify the solution**: Check that the solution satisfies all the original constraints.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define symbolic variables for each letter\nA, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M = symbols('A B C D E F G H I J K L M')\n\n# Define the equations based on the given constraints\nequations = [\n    Eq(B, 1.4 * G),\n    Eq(A, 3.2 * G),\n    Eq(J, 3.0 * G),\n    Eq(A, 1.6 * K),\n    Eq(A + J, 31),\n    Eq(A + B, 23),\n    Eq(F, 2.4 * K),\n    Eq(M - B, 89),\n    Eq(I - B, 43),\n    Eq(F, 4.8 * G),\n    Eq(B, 3.5 * L)\n]\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve(equations, (A, B, F, G, I, J, K, L, M))\n\n# Given numbers to assign\nnumbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, 96]\n\n# Extract the solved values\nsolved_values = {var: solution[var] for var in solution}\n\n# Assign the remaining numbers to C, D, E, H\nremaining_vars = [C, D, E, H]\nremaining_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num not in solved_values.values()]\n\n# Assign the remaining numbers to the remaining variables\nfor var, num in zip(remaining_vars, remaining_numbers):\n    solved_values[var] = num\n\n# Create a list of values in alphabetical order\nvalues = [solved_values[var] for var in [A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M]]\n\n# Print the list of values\nprint(f\"<<<{values}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code uses SymPy to solve the system of equations symbolically and assigns the remaining numbers to the letters that were not directly solved.
