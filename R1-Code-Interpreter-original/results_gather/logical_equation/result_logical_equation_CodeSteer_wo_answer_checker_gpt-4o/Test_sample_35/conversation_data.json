    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the given numbers to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K such that all the given inequalities are satisfied. We will use the constraints to determine the values step by step.\n\n### Plan:\n1. **Identify Direct Relationships:**\n   - From equation 3: \\( K = 2.0D \\)\n   - From equation 4: \\( E = 3.0D \\)\n   - From equation 1: \\( E = 1.5K \\)\n   - From equation 9: \\( E + K = 375 \\)\n\n2. **Solve for D, E, and K:**\n   - Using equations 3 and 4, we have \\( K = 2.0D \\) and \\( E = 3.0D \\).\n   - Substitute these into equation 9: \\( 3.0D + 2.0D = 375 \\) which simplifies to \\( 5.0D = 375 \\).\n   - Solve for \\( D \\): \\( D = 75 \\).\n   - Calculate \\( K \\) and \\( E \\) using \\( D \\):\n     - \\( K = 2.0 \\times 75 = 150 \\)\n     - \\( E = 3.0 \\times 75 = 225 \\)\n\n3. **Use Remaining Equations:**\n   - From equation 5: \\( D - C = -46 \\) implies \\( C = D + 46 = 75 + 46 = 121 \\).\n   - From equation 2: \\( D + I = 155 \\) implies \\( I = 155 - D = 155 - 75 = 80 \\).\n   - From equation 7: \\( H + I = 83 \\) implies \\( H = 83 - I = 83 - 80 = 3 \\).\n   - From equation 10: \\( F - D = -27 \\) implies \\( F = D - 27 = 75 - 27 = 48 \\).\n   - From equation 6: \\( F + H = 51 \\) implies \\( H = 51 - F = 51 - 48 = 3 \\) (which is consistent).\n\n4. **Determine Remaining Values:**\n   - From equation 8: \\( F = 3.0G \\) implies \\( G = F / 3.0 = 48 / 3.0 = 16 \\).\n\n5. **Assign Remaining Numbers:**\n   - The numbers left are 9 and 27, which must be assigned to A and B.\n   - Since there are no constraints on A and B, we can assign them arbitrarily: A = 9, B = 27.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the values in alphabetical order:\n\n```python\n# Assign values based on the calculations\nA = 9\nB = 27\nC = 121\nD = 75\nE = 225\nF = 48\nG = 16\nH = 3\nI = 80\nJ = 36  # J is the only number left, not used in any equation\nK = 150\n\n# Output the values in alphabetical order\nresult = [A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K]\nprint(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n```",
    "To solve this problem using a more sophisticated approach, we can leverage the `SymPy` library, which is designed for symbolic mathematics. This will allow us to define the equations symbolically and solve them systematically.
