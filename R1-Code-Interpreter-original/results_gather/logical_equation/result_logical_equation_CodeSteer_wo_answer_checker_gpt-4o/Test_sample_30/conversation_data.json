    "The current code attempts to solve the system of equations using symbolic computing with the SymPy library, but it encounters a KeyError because the solution does not include a value for 'A'. This suggests that the system of equations might be underdetermined or incorrectly specified. To improve the code, ensure that all equations are correctly set up and consider using additional constraints or checks to verify the solution's validity. Additionally, verify that the solution includes all variables before attempting to access them. Re-evaluate the equations and ensure they are consistent with the problem statement."
