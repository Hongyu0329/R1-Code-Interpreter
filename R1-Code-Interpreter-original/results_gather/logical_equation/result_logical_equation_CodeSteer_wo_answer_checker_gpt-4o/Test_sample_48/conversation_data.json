    "The current approach using SymPy is on the right track, but the error indicates that the `solve` function is being used incorrectly. SymPy's `solve` function is not designed to handle multiple equations and inequalities simultaneously in the way attempted. Instead, consider using `solve` for individual equations and `reduce_inequalities` for inequalities. Additionally, ensure that the solution is mapped correctly to the given set of numbers. Here's how you can improve the code:\n\n1. Use `solve` for each equation separately to find possible values.\n2. Use `reduce_inequalities` to handle inequalities.\n3. Implement a search or permutation strategy to map the solutions to the given set of numbers, ensuring all constraints are satisfied.\n\nRefactor the code to incorporate these suggestions and handle the constraints more effectively.

    "The current approach using permutations is computationally expensive, leading to a timeout. To improve efficiency, consider the following guidance:\n\n1. **Reduce the search space**: Use the constraints to narrow down possible values for each variable before generating permutations. For example, directly solve equations that involve fewer variables to reduce possibilities.\n\n2. **Incremental solving**: Instead of generating all permutations, incrementally assign values to variables and check constraints as you go. This can be done using a backtracking approach.\n\n3. **Use SymPy's `solve` and `reduce_inequalities` more effectively**: Solve individual equations to find possible values for some variables, then use these to reduce the search space for others.\n\nRefactor the code to incorporate these strategies, which will help in solving the system more efficiently without timing out."
