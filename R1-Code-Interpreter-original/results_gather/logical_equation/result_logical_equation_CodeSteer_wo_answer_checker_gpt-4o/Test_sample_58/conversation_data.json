    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the correct numbers to each letter based on the given inequalities. We have a set of numbers and a set of equations that relate these numbers to each other. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers**: The numbers we have are 3, 9, 16, 20, 39, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225.\n\n2. **Analyze the equations**: We have 11 equations that relate the letters to each other. We will use these equations to determine the value of each letter.\n\n3. **Solve the equations**: We will solve the equations step by step, using substitution and elimination methods to find the value of each letter.\n\n4. **Assign the numbers**: Once we have determined the value of each letter, we will assign the corresponding number to each letter.\n\n5. **Output the result**: Finally, we will output the result in the specified format.\n\nLet's solve the equations:\n\n- From equations 2 and 5, we have:\n  - \\( H - C = -46 \\) and \\( C - H = 46 \\). These are consistent and imply \\( C = H + 46 \\).\n\n- From equation 7, \\( C - D = -104 \\), we have \\( D = C + 104 \\).\n\n- From equation 6, \\( D = 3.0H \\), we can substitute \\( D = C + 104 \\) to get \\( C + 104 = 3.0H \\).\n\n- From equation 8, \\( H - J = 36 \\), we have \\( J = H - 36 \\).\n\n- From equation 11, \\( C - K = 112 \\), we have \\( K = C - 112 \\).\n\n- From equation 3, \\( K = 3.0G \\), we can substitute \\( K = C - 112 \\) to get \\( C - 112 = 3.0G \\).\n\n- From equation 4, \\( B + I = 230 \\).\n\n- From equation 10, \\( I - E = 60 \\), we have \\( I = E + 60 \\).\n\n- From equation 1, \\( B + E = 170 \\).\n\n- From equation 9, \\( A = 2.4E \\).\n\nNow, let's solve these equations using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbols\nA, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K = symbols('A B C D E F G H I J K')\n\n# Define the equations\neq1 = Eq(B + E, 170)\neq2 = Eq(H - C, -46)\neq3 = Eq(K, 3.0 * G)\neq4 = Eq(B + I, 230)\neq5 = Eq(C - H, 46)\neq6 = Eq(D, 3.0 * H)\neq7 = Eq(C - D, -104)\neq8 = Eq(H - J, 36)\neq9 = Eq(A, 2.4 * E)\neq10 = Eq(I - E, 60)\neq11 = Eq(C - K, 112)\n\n# Solve the equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2, eq3, eq4, eq5, eq6, eq7, eq8, eq9, eq10, eq11), (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K))\n\n# Output the solution in the specified format\nresult = [solution[A], solution[B], solution[C], solution[D], solution[E], solution[F], solution[G], solution[H], solution[I], solution[J], solution[K]]\nprint(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will solve the system of equations and output the values of the letters in alphabetical order.",
