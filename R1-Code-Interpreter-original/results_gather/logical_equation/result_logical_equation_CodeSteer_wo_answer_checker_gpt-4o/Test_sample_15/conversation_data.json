    "To solve this problem, we need to find the values of the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I that satisfy the given system of equations. We are given a set of possible values for these letters: 3, 6, 9, 20, 32, 36, 80, 120, and 121.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the equations:**\n   - C + I = 241\n   - E - H = -44\n   - I = 1.5H\n   - D + E = 42\n   - D + H = 86\n   - F + G = 35\n   - D = 2.0F\n   - A + I = 140\n\n2. **Use the equations to find relationships between the variables:**\n   - From equation 3, I = 1.5H, we can express I in terms of H.\n   - From equation 5, D + H = 86, we can express D in terms of H.\n   - From equation 7, D = 2.0F, we can express F in terms of D.\n\n3. **Substitute the known values into the equations:**\n   - Use the known values to solve for each variable step by step.\n\n4. **Check the possible values for each letter:**\n   - Ensure that each letter is assigned one of the given values: 3, 6, 9, 20, 32, 36, 80, 120, 121.\n\n5. **Solve the equations:**\n   - Use the relationships and constraints to find the values of each letter.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Possible values for the letters\nvalues = [3, 6, 9, 20, 32, 36, 80, 120, 121]\n\n# Iterate over all permutations of the values\nfor perm in permutations(values):\n    A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I = perm\n    \n    # Check all the conditions\n    if (C + I == 241 and\n        E - H == -44 and\n        I == 1.5 * H and\n        D + E == 42 and\n        D + H == 86 and\n        F + G == 35 and\n        D == 2.0 * F and\n        A + I == 140):\n        \n        # If all conditions are satisfied, print the result\n        print(f\"<<<{[A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I]}>>>\")\n        break\n```\n\nThis code will iterate over all possible permutations of the given values and check if they satisfy all the given equations. Once it finds a valid solution, it will print the values in the required format."
