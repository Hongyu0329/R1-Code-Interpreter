    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 1, 3, 4, 9, 16, 27, 36, 80, and 121 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I such that all the given inequalities and equations are satisfied. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the equations and inequalities:**\n   - A + E = 107\n   - D + H = 137\n   - H > C\n   - A + B = 63\n   - E - F = 79\n   - B + E = 116\n   - B - D = -85\n\n2. **Analyze the equations:**\n   - From A + E = 107 and A + B = 63, we can express E in terms of B: E = 107 - A.\n   - From B + E = 116, we can express E in terms of B: E = 116 - B.\n   - Equating the two expressions for E, we get: 107 - A = 116 - B, which simplifies to B = A + 9.\n   - From B - D = -85, we have D = B + 85.\n   - From D + H = 137, we have H = 137 - D.\n\n3. **Substitute and solve:**\n   - Substitute D = B + 85 into H = 137 - D to get H = 137 - (B + 85) = 52 - B.\n   - Substitute B = A + 9 into H = 52 - B to get H = 52 - (A + 9) = 43 - A.\n   - Substitute E = 107 - A into E - F = 79 to get F = 107 - A - 79 = 28 - A.\n\n4. **Assign values to letters:**\n   - We have the following expressions:\n     - B = A + 9\n     - D = B + 85\n     - H = 43 - A\n     - F = 28 - A\n     - E = 107 - A\n   - We need to assign the numbers 1, 3, 4, 9, 16, 27, 36, 80, and 121 to these letters such that all conditions are satisfied.\n\n5. **Iterate over possible values for A:**\n   - We will iterate over possible values for A and calculate the corresponding values for B, D, H, F, and E. We will check if these values are in the set of available numbers and satisfy all conditions.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Possible values for the letters\nvalues = [1, 3, 4, 9, 16, 27, 36, 80, 121]\n\n# Iterate over all permutations of the values\nfor perm in permutations(values):\n    A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I = perm\n    \n    # Check all conditions\n    if (A + E == 107 and\n        D + H == 137 and\n        H > C and\n        A + B == 63 and\n        E - F == 79 and\n        B + E == 116 and\n        B - D == -85):\n        \n        # If all conditions are satisfied, print the result\n        print(f\"<<<[{A}, {B}, {C}, {D}, {E}, {F}, {G}, {H}, {I}]>>>\")\n        break\n```\n\nThis code will find the correct assignment of numbers to letters that satisfies all the given conditions and print the result in the required format."
