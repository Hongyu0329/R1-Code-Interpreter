    "The current approach using SymPy is on the right track for solving the system of equations symbolically. However, the error indicates that not all variables have been solved, likely due to insufficient constraints or incorrect assumptions about the solution set. To improve the code:\n\n1. Ensure that all equations are correctly set up and consider any additional constraints or assumptions that might be necessary.\n2. Check if the system of equations is over-constrained or under-constrained, and adjust accordingly.\n3. Use SymPy's `solve` function to solve for a subset of variables if the full solution is not feasible.\n4. Verify that the solution satisfies all the given inequalities.\n\nRefine the code to address these points and ensure that the solution is complete and correct."
