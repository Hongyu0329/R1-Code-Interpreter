    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the given numbers to the letters A through M such that all the inequalities are satisfied. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers and their possible assignments:**\n   - The numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, 96.\n\n2. **Analyze the inequalities:**\n   - From inequality 1: \\( K - G = 25 \\)\n   - From inequality 2: \\( F = 3.5M \\)\n   - From inequality 3: \\( B + E = 141 \\)\n   - From inequality 4: \\( J + K = 38 \\)\n   - From inequality 5: \\( B + I = 50 \\)\n   - From inequality 6: \\( A - G = 33 \\)\n   - From inequality 7: \\( I + M = 7 \\)\n   - From inequality 8: \\( A - H = -14 \\)\n   - From inequality 9: \\( M - H = -48 \\)\n   - From inequality 10: \\( C - E = -72 \\)\n   - From inequality 11: \\( F = 1.4I \\)\n\n3. **Solve the inequalities:**\n   - From inequality 7: \\( I + M = 7 \\), the only possible values for \\( I \\) and \\( M \\) are 5 and 2, respectively.\n   - From inequality 11: \\( F = 1.4I \\), with \\( I = 5 \\), \\( F = 7 \\).\n   - From inequality 2: \\( F = 3.5M \\), with \\( M = 2 \\), \\( F = 7 \\) (consistent).\n   - From inequality 5: \\( B + I = 50 \\), with \\( I = 5 \\), \\( B = 45 \\).\n   - From inequality 3: \\( B + E = 141 \\), with \\( B = 45 \\), \\( E = 96 \\).\n   - From inequality 10: \\( C - E = -72 \\), with \\( E = 96 \\), \\( C = 24 \\).\n   - From inequality 1: \\( K - G = 25 \\), possible values for \\( K \\) and \\( G \\) are 36 and 11, respectively.\n   - From inequality 4: \\( J + K = 38 \\), with \\( K = 36 \\), \\( J = 2 \\).\n   - From inequality 6: \\( A - G = 33 \\), with \\( G = 3 \\), \\( A = 36 \\).\n   - From inequality 8: \\( A - H = -14 \\), with \\( A = 36 \\), \\( H = 50 \\).\n   - From inequality 9: \\( M - H = -48 \\), with \\( M = 2 \\), \\( H = 50 \\).\n\n4. **Assign the remaining numbers:**\n   - The remaining numbers are 10, 15, and 16, which can be assigned to D, G, and L.\n\n5. **Compile the results:**\n   - A = 36, B = 45, C = 24, D = 10, E = 96, F = 7, G = 11, H = 50, I = 5, J = 2, K = 36, L = 15, M = 2.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the results:\n\n```python\n# Assigning the values to the letters\nA = 36\nB = 45\nC = 24\nD = 10\nE = 96\nF = 7\nG = 11\nH = 50\nI = 5\nJ = 2\nK = 36\nL = 15\nM = 2\n\n# Output the results in alphabetical order\nresult = [A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M]\nprint(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n```",
    "To solve this problem more effectively, we can use a systematic approach to check all possible assignments of numbers to letters. We can use Python's itertools library to generate permutations of the numbers and then check each permutation against the system of inequalities. This brute-force method is feasible given the relatively small number of permutations (13!).\n\nHere's the plan:\n\n1. **Generate all permutations** of the given numbers.\n2. **Check each permutation** to see if it satisfies all the inequalities.\n3. **Return the first valid permutation** that satisfies all the inequalities.\n\nLet's implement this approach using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# The numbers to be assigned\nnumbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, 96]\n\n# Iterate over all permutations of the numbers\nfor perm in permutations(numbers):\n    A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M = perm\n    \n    # Check if the current permutation satisfies all the inequalities\n    if (K - G == 25 and\n        F == 3.5 * M and\n        B + E == 141 and\n        J + K == 38 and\n        B + I == 50 and\n        A - G == 33 and\n        I + M == 7 and\n        A - H == -14 and\n        M - H == -48 and\n        C - E == -72 and\n        F == 1.4 * I):\n        \n        # If all inequalities are satisfied, print the result\n        result = [A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M]\n        print(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n        break\n```\n\nThis code will systematically check each permutation of the numbers and print the first one that satisfies all the given inequalities. The use of permutations ensures that we explore all possible assignments of numbers to letters.",
    "To solve this problem more efficiently, we can use constraint satisfaction techniques. One way to do this in Python is by using the `SymPy` library, which allows us to define and solve systems of equations and inequalities symbolically. This approach will help us reduce the search space and find a solution more efficiently.\n\nHere's how we can implement this using `SymPy`:\n\n1. **Define the variables** for each letter.\n2. **Set up the equations and inequalities** based on the given constraints.\n3. **Solve the system** using `SymPy` to find the values that satisfy all constraints.\n\nLet's implement this approach:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables for each letter\nA, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M = symbols('A B C D E F G H I J K L M')\n\n# Define the equations and inequalities\nequations = [\n    Eq(K - G, 25),\n    Eq(F, 3.5 * M),\n    Eq(B + E, 141),\n    Eq(J + K, 38),\n    Eq(B + I, 50),\n    Eq(A - G, 33),\n    Eq(I + M, 7),\n    Eq(A - H, -14),\n    Eq(M - H, -48),\n    Eq(C - E, -72),\n    Eq(F, 1.4 * I)\n]\n\n# Define the possible values for each variable\npossible_values = [2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, 96]\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve(equations, (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M), dict=True)\n\n# Filter solutions to match possible values\nfor sol in solution:\n    if all(value in possible_values for value in sol.values()):\n        result = [sol[A], sol[B], sol[C], sol[D], sol[E], sol[F], sol[G], sol[H], sol[I], sol[J], sol[K], sol[L], sol[M]]\n        print(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n        break\n```\n\nThis code uses `SymPy` to define the system of equations and solve it. The solution is then filtered to ensure that all values are within the given possible values.
