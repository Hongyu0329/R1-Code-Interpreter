    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the correct numbers to each letter based on the given inequalities. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the numbers and letters**: We have 11 numbers: 3, 9, 16, 27, 36, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225. The letters are A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K.\n\n2. **Translate the inequalities into equations**:\n   - H + J = 130\n   - C + I = 177\n   - C + G = 75\n   - G = 3.0F\n   - B - E = 150\n   - J - C = -18\n   - E + G = 123\n   - D + F = 96\n   - E + K = 78\n   - H + K = 124\n\n3. **Solve the equations step by step**:\n   - From G = 3.0F, we know G must be 3 times F. The only pair that satisfies this from the list is G = 75 and F = 25.\n   - From C + G = 75, and knowing G = 75, we find C = 0, which is not possible. Re-evaluate: C must be 0, but since C is a number from the list, we need to check our assumptions.\n   - From J - C = -18, we know J = C - 18.\n   - From H + J = 130, substitute J = C - 18 to get H + C - 18 = 130, so H = 148 - C.\n   - From C + I = 177, we know I = 177 - C.\n   - From E + G = 123, and G = 75, we find E = 48.\n   - From B - E = 150, and E = 48, we find B = 198, which is not possible. Re-evaluate: B must be 150 + E, so B = 198, which is not in the list. Re-evaluate assumptions.\n   - From E + K = 78, and E = 48, we find K = 30, which is not possible. Re-evaluate: K must be 78 - E, so K = 30, which is not in the list. Re-evaluate assumptions.\n   - From H + K = 124, substitute K = 78 - E to get H + 78 - E = 124, so H = 46 + E.\n\n4. **Iterate through possible values**: We need to iterate through possible values for each letter and check if they satisfy all equations.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the correct values for each letter.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Possible values for the letters\nvalues = [3, 9, 16, 27, 36, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225]\n\n# Iterate through all permutations of the values\nfor perm in permutations(values):\n    A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K = perm\n    \n    # Check all conditions\n    if (H + J == 130 and\n        C + I == 177 and\n        C + G == 75 and\n        G == 3 * F and\n        B - E == 150 and\n        J - C == -18 and\n        E + G == 123 and\n        D + F == 96 and\n        E + K == 78 and\n        H + K == 124):\n        \n        # If all conditions are satisfied, print the result\n        print(f\"<<<[{A}, {B}, {C}, {D}, {E}, {F}, {G}, {H}, {I}, {J}, {K}]>>>\")\n        break\n```\n\nThis code will iterate through all permutations of the given numbers and check if they satisfy all the given inequalities. Once it finds a valid solution, it will print the values in alphabetical order.",
    "To solve this problem more efficiently, we can use symbolic computation with the `sympy` library in Python. This approach allows us to define the equations symbolically and solve them using a solver. Here's how we can do it:\n\n1. **Define the variables**: Use symbolic variables for each letter.\n\n2. **Set up the equations**: Translate the given inequalities into equations using the symbolic variables.\n\n3. **Solve the system of equations**: Use `sympy`'s solver to find the values of the variables that satisfy all the equations.\n\nLet's implement this approach:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define symbolic variables for each letter\nA, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K = symbols('A B C D E F G H I J K')\n\n# Define the equations based on the given inequalities\nequations = [\n    Eq(H + J, 130),\n    Eq(C + I, 177),\n    Eq(C + G, 75),\n    Eq(G, 3 * F),\n    Eq(B - E, 150),\n    Eq(J - C, -18),\n    Eq(E + G, 123),\n    Eq(D + F, 96),\n    Eq(E + K, 78),\n    Eq(H + K, 124)\n]\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve(equations, (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K))\n\n# Extract the solution and print it in the required format\nvalues = [solution[A], solution[B], solution[C], solution[D], solution[E], solution[F], solution[G], solution[H], solution[I], solution[J], solution[K]]\nprint(f\"<<<{values}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code uses `sympy` to define the equations and solve them symbolically.
