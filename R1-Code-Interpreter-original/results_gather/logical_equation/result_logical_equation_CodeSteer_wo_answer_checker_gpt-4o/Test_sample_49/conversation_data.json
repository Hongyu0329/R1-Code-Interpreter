    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the correct numbers to each letter based on the given inequalities and equations. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Variables and Equations:**\n   - We have 11 letters: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K.\n   - Each letter represents one of the numbers: 3, 9, 16, 20, 39, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225.\n   - We have 11 equations/inequalities to satisfy.\n\n2. **Analyze the Equations:**\n   - From equation 7: \\( I = 3.0A \\)\n   - From equation 1: \\( A + I = 300 \\)\n   - Substitute equation 7 into equation 1: \\( A + 3A = 300 \\) which simplifies to \\( 4A = 300 \\) so \\( A = 75 \\).\n   - From equation 7: \\( I = 3 \\times 75 = 225 \\).\n   - From equation 8: \\( F = 2.0A = 2 \\times 75 = 150 \\).\n   - From equation 9: \\( I = 1.5F \\) which is consistent since \\( 225 = 1.5 \\times 150 \\).\n   - From equation 10: \\( A - C = 55 \\) so \\( C = A - 55 = 75 - 55 = 20 \\).\n   - From equation 6: \\( J = 4.0C = 4 \\times 20 = 80 \\).\n   - From equation 4: \\( J > A \\) which is true since \\( 80 > 75 \\).\n   - From equation 2: \\( E = 2.4C = 2.4 \\times 20 = 48 \\).\n   - From equation 5: \\( A - G = 66 \\) so \\( G = A - 66 = 75 - 66 = 9 \\).\n   - From equation 3: \\( G = 3.0K \\) so \\( K = G / 3 = 9 / 3 = 3 \\).\n   - From equation 11: \\( H - A = -59 \\) so \\( H = A - 59 = 75 - 59 = 16 \\).\n\n3. **Assign Remaining Numbers:**\n   - The numbers 3, 9, 16, 20, 39, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225 are all used except for 39 and 121.\n   - Assign the remaining numbers to B and D. Since there are no constraints on B and D, we can assign them arbitrarily: B = 39, D = 121.\n\n4. **Compile the Results:**\n   - A = 75, B = 39, C = 20, D = 121, E = 48, F = 150, G = 9, H = 16, I = 225, J = 80, K = 3.\n\nNow, let's write the Python code to output the results:\n\n```python\n# Assign the values to the letters\nA = 75\nB = 39\nC = 20\nD = 121\nE = 48\nF = 150\nG = 9\nH = 16\nI = 225\nJ = 80\nK = 3\n\n# Create a list of values in alphabetical order\nresult = [A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K]\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n```",
