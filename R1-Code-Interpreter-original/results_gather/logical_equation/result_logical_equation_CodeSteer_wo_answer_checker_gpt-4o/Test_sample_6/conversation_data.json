    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 1, 3, 4, 9, 16, 27, 36, 80, and 121 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n\n1. \\( E + F = 83 \\)\n2. \\( A - H = -112 \\)\n3. \\( G = 4.0 \\times C \\)\n4. \\( B + D = 63 \\)\n5. \\( D = 3.0 \\times A \\)\n6. \\( G + H = 125 \\)\n7. \\( B - E = 33 \\)\n\nWe will solve these equations step by step:\n\n1. From equation 2, \\( A - H = -112 \\), we have \\( A = H - 112 \\).\n2. From equation 5, \\( D = 3.0 \\times A \\), we can substitute \\( A \\) from step 1.\n3. From equation 4, \\( B + D = 63 \\), we can substitute \\( D \\) from step 2.\n4. From equation 7, \\( B - E = 33 \\), we can express \\( B \\) in terms of \\( E \\).\n5. From equation 1, \\( E + F = 83 \\), we can express \\( F \\) in terms of \\( E \\).\n6. From equation 3, \\( G = 4.0 \\times C \\), we can express \\( G \\) in terms of \\( C \\).\n7. From equation 6, \\( G + H = 125 \\), we can substitute \\( G \\) from step 6.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python to find the values of each letter:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Possible values for the letters\nvalues = [1, 3, 4, 9, 16, 27, 36, 80, 121]\n\n# Iterate over all permutations of the values\nfor perm in permutations(values):\n    A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I = perm\n    \n    # Check all conditions\n    if (E + F == 83 and\n        A - H == -112 and\n        G == 4 * C and\n        B + D == 63 and\n        D == 3 * A and\n        G + H == 125 and\n        B - E == 33):\n        \n        # If all conditions are satisfied, print the result\n        print(f\"<<<[{A}, {B}, {C}, {D}, {E}, {F}, {G}, {H}, {I}]>>>\")\n        break\n```\n\nThis code will iterate over all permutations of the given numbers and check if they satisfy all the given conditions. Once it finds a valid permutation, it will print the values in the required format."
