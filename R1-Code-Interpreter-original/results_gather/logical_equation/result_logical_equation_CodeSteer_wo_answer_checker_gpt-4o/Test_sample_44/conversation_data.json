    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the correct numbers to each letter based on the given inequalities and equations. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the possible values**: The numbers available are 3, 9, 16, 27, 36, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, and 225.\n\n2. **Analyze the equations and inequalities**:\n   - From equation 1: \\( F - C = -141 \\) implies \\( F = C - 141 \\).\n   - From equation 3: \\( E + K = 305 \\).\n   - From equation 4: \\( K = 3.0A \\).\n   - From equation 5: \\( H = 3.0F \\).\n   - From equation 6: \\( I + J = 157 \\).\n   - From equation 7: \\( K = 1.5C \\).\n   - From equation 8: \\( K - A = 150 \\) implies \\( K = A + 150 \\).\n   - From equation 9: \\( F + G = 25 \\).\n   - From equation 10: \\( B + C = 153 \\).\n\n3. **Solve the equations**:\n   - From equation 4 and 8, we have \\( K = 3A \\) and \\( K = A + 150 \\). Solving these gives \\( 3A = A + 150 \\), so \\( 2A = 150 \\), thus \\( A = 75 \\).\n   - Substituting \\( A = 75 \\) into \\( K = A + 150 \\), we get \\( K = 225 \\).\n   - From equation 7, \\( K = 1.5C \\) gives \\( 225 = 1.5C \\), so \\( C = 150 \\).\n   - From equation 1, \\( F = C - 141 \\) gives \\( F = 150 - 141 = 9 \\).\n   - From equation 9, \\( F + G = 25 \\) gives \\( 9 + G = 25 \\), so \\( G = 16 \\).\n   - From equation 10, \\( B + C = 153 \\) gives \\( B + 150 = 153 \\), so \\( B = 3 \\).\n   - From equation 5, \\( H = 3.0F \\) gives \\( H = 3 \\times 9 = 27 \\).\n   - From equation 3, \\( E + K = 305 \\) gives \\( E + 225 = 305 \\), so \\( E = 80 \\).\n   - From equation 6, \\( I + J = 157 \\). The remaining numbers are 36 and 121, so \\( I = 36 \\) and \\( J = 121 \\).\n\n4. **Compile the results**: Assign the values to each letter in alphabetical order.\n\n```python\n# Assigning the values to each letter\nA = 75\nB = 3\nC = 150\nD = 48  # D is the remaining number after assigning others\nE = 80\nF = 9\nG = 16\nH = 27\nI = 36\nJ = 121\nK = 225\n\n# Output the results in the required format\nresult = [A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K]\nprint(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n```",
