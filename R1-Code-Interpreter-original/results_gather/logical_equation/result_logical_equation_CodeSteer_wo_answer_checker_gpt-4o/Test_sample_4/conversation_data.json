    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 1, 3, 4, 9, 16, 27, 36, 80, and 121 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n\n1. \\( C - E = -5 \\) implies \\( C = E - 5 \\).\n2. \\( D - F = 79 \\) implies \\( D = F + 79 \\).\n3. \\( G = 4.0E \\).\n4. \\( H = 4.0C \\).\n5. \\( E - G = -27 \\) implies \\( E = G - 27 \\).\n6. \\( E + H = 25 \\).\n7. \\( A + H = 137 \\).\n\nWe can use these equations to find the values of the letters step by step:\n\n1. From equation 5, \\( E = G - 27 \\).\n2. Substitute \\( E \\) from equation 5 into equation 3: \\( G = 4.0(G - 27) \\).\n3. Solve for \\( G \\) and then find \\( E \\) using equation 5.\n4. Use equation 1 to find \\( C \\).\n5. Use equation 4 to find \\( H \\).\n6. Use equation 6 to verify \\( E \\) and \\( H \\).\n7. Use equation 7 to find \\( A \\).\n8. Use equation 2 to find \\( D \\) and \\( F \\).\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\n# Given numbers\nnumbers = [1, 3, 4, 9, 16, 27, 36, 80, 121]\n\n# Initialize a dictionary to store the values of each letter\nvalues = {}\n\n# Solve for G and E\nfor G in numbers:\n    E = G - 27\n    if E in numbers:\n        # Solve for C\n        C = E - 5\n        if C in numbers:\n            # Solve for H\n            H = 4 * C\n            if H in numbers:\n                # Verify E + H = 25\n                if E + H == 25:\n                    # Solve for A\n                    A = 137 - H\n                    if A in numbers:\n                        # Solve for D and F\n                        for D in numbers:\n                            F = D - 79\n                            if F in numbers:\n                                # Check if all values are unique\n                                if len(set([A, C, D, E, F, G, H])) == 7:\n                                    # Find the remaining number for B and I\n                                    remaining_numbers = set(numbers) - {A, C, D, E, F, G, H}\n                                    B, I = remaining_numbers\n                                    # Assign values to the dictionary\n                                    values['A'] = A\n                                    values['B'] = B\n                                    values['C'] = C\n                                    values['D'] = D\n                                    values['E'] = E\n                                    values['F'] = F\n                                    values['G'] = G\n                                    values['H'] = H\n                                    values['I'] = I\n                                    break\n\n# Output the values in alphabetical order\nresult = [values[letter] for letter in sorted(values.keys())]\nprint(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the values for each letter and print them in the required format."
