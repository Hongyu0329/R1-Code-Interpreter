    "To solve this problem more efficiently, we can use the `constraint` module in Python, which allows us to define constraints and search for solutions that satisfy all of them. This approach is more efficient than trying all permutations because it prunes the search space by only considering combinations that satisfy the constraints.\n\nHere's how we can implement this using the `constraint` module:\n\n1. **Define the problem and variables:**\n   - We have 13 variables (A to M) and a set of numbers that need to be assigned to these variables.\n\n2. **Add constraints:**\n   - Add each of the given equations and inequalities as constraints.\n\n3. **Solve the problem:**\n   - Use the constraint solver to find a solution that satisfies all constraints.\n\nLet's implement this:\n\n```python\nfrom constraint import Problem\n\n# Create a problem instance\nproblem = Problem()\n\n# Define the variables and their possible values\nletters = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'J', 'K', 'L', 'M']\nnumbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, 96]\n\n# Add variables to the problem\nproblem.addVariables(letters, numbers)\n\n# Add constraints based on the given equations\nproblem.addConstraint(lambda I, E: I - E == -4, ('I', 'E'))\nproblem.addConstraint(lambda F, K: F == 2.5 * K, ('F', 'K'))\nproblem.addConstraint(lambda I, B: I == 1.5 * B, ('I', 'B'))\nproblem.addConstraint(lambda L, A: L - A == 33, ('L', 'A'))\nproblem.addConstraint(lambda E, H: E == 2.8 * H, ('E', 'H'))\nproblem.addConstraint(lambda C, M: C + M == 111, ('C', 'M'))\nproblem.addConstraint(lambda L, C: L - C == -60, ('L', 'C'))\nproblem.addConstraint(lambda H, F: H == 2.0 * F, ('H', 'F'))\nproblem.addConstraint(lambda F, L: F + L == 41, ('F', 'L'))\nproblem.addConstraint(lambda K, E: K - E == -26, ('K', 'E'))\nproblem.addConstraint(lambda A, F: A + F == 8, ('A', 'F'))\n\n# Ensure all variables have unique values\nproblem.addConstraint(lambda *args: len(set(args)) == len(args), letters)\n\n# Find a solution\nsolution = problem.getSolution()\n\n# Print the solution in the required format\nif solution:\n    result = [solution[letter] for letter in sorted(letters)]\n    print(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No solution found.\")\n```\n\nThis code uses the `constraint` module to define the problem, add constraints, and find a solution.

    "The current approach using permutations is computationally expensive and leads to a timeout. To improve the solution, consider using a more efficient method that leverages symbolic computing and constraint satisfaction techniques. You can use libraries like SymPy to symbolically solve the equations and inequalities, or use constraint programming libraries like Python's `constraint` module to efficiently search for solutions. This will help in reducing the search space and finding the solution more effectively. Try to implement a solution using these advanced techniques."
