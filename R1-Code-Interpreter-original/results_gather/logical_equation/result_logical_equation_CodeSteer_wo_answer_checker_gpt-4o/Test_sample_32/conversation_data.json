    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the correct numbers to each letter based on the given inequalities. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Variables and Values**: We have 11 letters (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K) and 11 numbers (3, 9, 16, 27, 36, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225).\n\n2. **Translate Inequalities into Equations**:\n   - D - A = 11\n   - H + I = 228\n   - G = 4.0B\n   - I - F = -118\n   - H - B = 216\n   - A + G = 52\n   - F + G = 157\n   - E = 3.0A\n   - G + I = 39\n   - C - H = -75\n\n3. **Solve the Equations**:\n   - From G = 4.0B, G must be a multiple of 4.\n   - From E = 3.0A, E must be a multiple of 3.\n   - Use the equations to find relationships between the variables and solve for each letter.\n\n4. **Assign Values**: Use the constraints to assign the correct numbers to each letter.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find the solution:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Possible values for the letters\nvalues = [3, 9, 16, 27, 36, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225]\n\n# Iterate over all permutations of the values\nfor perm in permutations(values):\n    A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K = perm\n    \n    # Check all the conditions\n    if (D - A == 11 and\n        H + I == 228 and\n        G == 4 * B and\n        I - F == -118 and\n        H - B == 216 and\n        A + G == 52 and\n        F + G == 157 and\n        E == 3 * A and\n        G + I == 39 and\n        C - H == -75):\n        \n        # If all conditions are satisfied, print the result\n        print(f\"<<<[{A}, {B}, {C}, {D}, {E}, {F}, {G}, {H}, {I}, {J}, {K}]>>>\")\n        break\n```\n\nThis code will iterate over all permutations of the given numbers and check if they satisfy all the given inequalities. Once it finds a valid solution, it will print the values in the required format.",
    "To solve the system of equations more efficiently, we can use the SymPy library in Python, which is designed for symbolic mathematics. This will allow us to solve the equations analytically without having to iterate over all permutations. Here's how we can do it:\n\n1. **Define the Variables**: Use SymPy to define symbolic variables for each letter.\n\n2. **Set Up the Equations**: Translate the given inequalities into equations using the symbolic variables.\n\n3. **Solve the System of Equations**: Use SymPy's solving capabilities to find the values of the variables.\n\nLet's implement this approach:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbolic variables\nA, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K = symbols('A B C D E F G H I J K')\n\n# Define the equations based on the given inequalities\nequations = [\n    Eq(D - A, 11),\n    Eq(H + I, 228),\n    Eq(G, 4 * B),\n    Eq(I - F, -118),\n    Eq(H - B, 216),\n    Eq(A + G, 52),\n    Eq(F + G, 157),\n    Eq(E, 3 * A),\n    Eq(G + I, 39),\n    Eq(C - H, -75)\n]\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve(equations, (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K))\n\n# Extract the solution in alphabetical order\nresult = [solution[A], solution[B], solution[C], solution[D], solution[E], \n          solution[F], solution[G], solution[H], solution[I], solution[J], solution[K]]\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code uses SymPy to define the variables and equations, then solves the system of equations to find the values for each letter. The solution is printed in the required format. This approach is more efficient than brute-forcing through permutations.",
