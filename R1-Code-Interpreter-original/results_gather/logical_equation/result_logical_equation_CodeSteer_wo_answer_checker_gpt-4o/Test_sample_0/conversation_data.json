    "The current approach using SymPy is on the right track, but there is an issue with solving for multiple variables simultaneously. Instead, consider solving the equations step-by-step, isolating one variable at a time, and then substituting back into the other equations. This method can help avoid the error encountered. Additionally, ensure that the domain of possible values is correctly applied to each variable. Refine the code to solve for each variable iteratively and check the constraints at each step. This will help in efficiently finding the correct solution."
