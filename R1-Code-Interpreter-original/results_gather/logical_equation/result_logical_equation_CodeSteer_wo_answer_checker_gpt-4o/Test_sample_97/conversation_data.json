    "The current solution approach is too simplistic and does not utilize symbolic computing or efficient searching to solve the system of equations. To improve the solution, consider using a more sophisticated method such as symbolic computation with libraries like SymPy in Python. This will allow you to solve the equations symbolically and ensure all constraints are satisfied. Additionally, implement a search algorithm to assign the remaining numbers to the letters not directly involved in the equations. This approach will help in finding a more accurate and reliable solution."
