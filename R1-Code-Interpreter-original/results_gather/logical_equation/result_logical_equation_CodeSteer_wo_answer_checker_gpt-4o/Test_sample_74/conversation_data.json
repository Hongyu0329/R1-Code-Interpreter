    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, and 50 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and M such that all the given inequalities and equations are satisfied.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n\n1. \\( E + F = 8 \\)\n2. \\( C - D = 14 \\)\n3. \\( A + M = 35 \\)\n4. \\( D + K = 3 \\)\n5. \\( G + J = 60 \\)\n6. \\( B > F \\)\n7. \\( H + I = 60 \\)\n8. \\( A - K = 5 \\)\n9. \\( G - H = 26 \\)\n10. \\( G - F = 45 \\)\n\nWe will solve these equations step by step:\n\n1. From equation 10, \\( G = F + 45 \\). Since \\( F \\) and \\( G \\) are both in the list of numbers, \\( F \\) must be 5 and \\( G \\) must be 50.\n2.

Since \\( C - D = 14 \\), \\( D = 1 \\) and \\( K = 2 \\).\n7. From equation 2, \\( C - 1 = 14 \\), so \\( C = 15 \\).\n8. From equation 8, \\( A - 2 = 5 \\), so \\( A = 7 \\).\n9.
