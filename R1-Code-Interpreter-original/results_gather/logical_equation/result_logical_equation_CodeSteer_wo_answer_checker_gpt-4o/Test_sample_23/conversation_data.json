    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 3, 6, 9, 20, 32, 36, 80, 120, and 121 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n\n1. \\( D + E = 15 \\)\n2. \\( A + F = 201 \\)\n3. \\( D = 1.5E \\)\n4. \\( C = 4.0D \\)\n5. \\( H > G \\)\n6. \\( E - I = -26 \\)\n7. \\( E = 2.0G \\)\n8. \\( C + I = 68 \\)\n\nWe will solve these equations step by step:\n\n- From equation 3, \\( D = 1.5E \\), and equation 1, \\( D + E = 15 \\), we can solve for \\( D \\) and \\( E \\).\n- From equation 7, \\( E = 2.0G \\), we can find \\( G \\) once \\( E \\) is known.\n- From equation 6, \\( E - I = -26 \\), we can find \\( I \\) once \\( E \\) is known.\n- From equation 4, \\( C = 4.0D \\), we can find \\( C \\) once \\( D \\) is known.\n- From equation 8, \\( C + I = 68 \\), we can verify \\( C \\) and \\( I \\).\n- From equation 2, \\( A + F = 201 \\), we can find \\( A \\) and \\( F \\).\n- Finally, we check \\( H > G \\).\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Possible values for the letters\nvalues = [3, 6, 9, 20, 32, 36, 80, 120, 121]\n\n# Iterate over all permutations of the values\nfor perm in permutations(values):\n    A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I = perm\n    \n    # Check all conditions\n    if (D + E == 15 and\n        A + F == 201 and\n        D == 1.5 * E and\n        C == 4.0 * D and\n        H > G and\n        E - I == -26 and\n        E == 2.0 * G and\n        C + I == 68):\n        \n        # If all conditions are satisfied, print the result\n        print(f\"<<<[{A}, {B}, {C}, {D}, {E}, {F}, {G}, {H}, {I}]>>>\")\n        break\n```\n\nThis code will iterate over all permutations of the given numbers and check if they satisfy all the given conditions. Once it finds a valid permutation, it will print the result in the required format."
