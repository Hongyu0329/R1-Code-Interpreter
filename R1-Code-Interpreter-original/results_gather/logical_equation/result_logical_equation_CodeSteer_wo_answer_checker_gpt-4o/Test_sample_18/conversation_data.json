    "The current code attempts to solve the problem using symbolic computing, but it encounters a KeyError due to the inclusion of an unnecessary variable 'G'. Since 'G' is not part of the given equations or inequalities, it should be removed from the list of symbols and the solution extraction. Additionally, ensure that the solution checks against the available numbers correctly. Refine the code to focus on the relevant variables and ensure the solution is valid by matching the sorted result with the sorted list of numbers.",
    "The current code still encounters a KeyError, this time with the variable 'I'. This suggests that the solution does not include all the expected variables, possibly due to the constraints not being fully solvable with the given equations. To address this, consider using a more comprehensive approach that involves iterating over possible values for the variables and checking all constraints, rather than relying solely on symbolic solving. This can be achieved by implementing a search algorithm that tests combinations of the given numbers to satisfy all equations and inequalities. This approach will ensure that all constraints are considered and a valid solution is found if it exists.",
    "The current code attempts to use a brute-force approach by iterating over permutations, but it encounters a ValueError due to an incorrect number of variables being unpacked. Since there are 9 numbers and 9 variables, ensure that all variables (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I) are included in the unpacking process. Additionally, ensure that the code checks all constraints correctly. Refine the code to include all variables and verify that each permutation satisfies all the given equations and inequalities.
