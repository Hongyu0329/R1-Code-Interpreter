    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 3, 9, 16, 27, 36, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, and 225 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities.\n\nLet's solve this step by step:\n\n1. **I = 1.5H**: This implies that I must be 1.5 times H. The possible pairs (H, I) from the given numbers are (80, 120), but since 120 is not in the list, we need to check other pairs. The correct pair is (80, 121).\n\n2. **F = 4.0B**: This implies that F must be 4 times B. The possible pairs (B, F) from the given numbers are (9, 36).\n\n3. **C + E = 169**: We need to find two numbers that sum to 169. The possible pair is (48, 121), but since 121 is already used for I, the correct pair is (48, 121).\n\n4. **E = 3.0J**: This implies that E must be 3 times J. The possible pair (J, E) is (27, 81), but since 81 is not in the list, the correct pair is (36, 108).\n\n5. **J - G = -11**: This implies that J is 11 less than G. The possible pair (G, J) is (36, 25), but since 25 is not in the list, the correct pair is (48, 37).\n\n6. **C > F**: This implies that C must be greater than F. From the pairs we have, C = 48 and F = 36 satisfy this condition.\n\n7. **I + K = 305**: We need to find two numbers that sum to 305. The possible pair is (121, 184), but since 184 is not in the list, the correct pair is (150, 155).\n\n8. **I - D = 222**: This implies that I is 222 more than D. The possible pair (D, I) is (3, 225).\n\n9. **J - F = -20**: This implies that J is 20 less than F. The possible pair (F, J) is (36, 16).\n\n10. **F + H = 186**: We need to find two numbers that sum to 186. The possible pair is (75, 111), but since 111 is not in the list, the correct pair is (75, 111).\n\nNow, let's assign the numbers to the letters based on these constraints and solve for the remaining letters.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbols for the letters\nA, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K = symbols('A B C D E F G H I J K')\n\n# Define the equations based on the given inequalities\nequations = [\n    Eq(I, 1.5 * H),\n    Eq(F, 4.0 * B),\n    Eq(C + E, 169),\n    Eq(E, 3.0 * J),\n    Eq(J - G, -11),\n    Eq(C > F),\n    Eq(I + K, 305),\n    Eq(I - D, 222),\n    Eq(J - F, -20),\n    Eq(F + H, 186)\n]\n\n# Define the possible values for the letters\npossible_values = [3, 9, 16, 27, 36, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225]\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve(equations, (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K), dict=True)\n\n# Filter the solution to match the possible values\nvalid_solution = None\nfor sol in solution:\n    if all(value in possible_values for value in sol.values()):\n        valid_solution = sol\n        break\n\n# Extract the values in alphabetical order\nresult = [valid_solution[A], valid_solution[B], valid_solution[C], valid_solution[D], valid_solution[E],\n          valid_solution[F], valid_solution[G], valid_solution[H], valid_solution[I], valid_solution[J], valid_solution[K]]\n\nresult\n\noutput >\n\n/home/sandbox/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/sympy/core/relational.py:500: SymPyDeprecationWarning: \n\nEq(expr) with rhs default to 0 has been deprecated since SymPy 1.5.\nUse Eq(expr, 0) instead.
