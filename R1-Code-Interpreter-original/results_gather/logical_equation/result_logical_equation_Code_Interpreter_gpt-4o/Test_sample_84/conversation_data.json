Let's solve these equations step by step.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variables\nA, B, G, J, K, F, M, I, L = symbols('A B G J K F M I L')\n\n# Define the equations based on the inequalities\neq1 = Eq(B, 1.4 * G)\neq2 = Eq(A, 3.2 * G)\neq3 = Eq(J, 3.0 * G)\neq4 = Eq(A, 1.6 * K)\neq5 = Eq(A + J, 31)\neq6 = Eq(A + B, 23)\neq7 = Eq(F, 2.4 * K)\neq8 = Eq(M - B, 89)\neq9 = Eq(I - B, 43)\neq10 = Eq(F, 4.8 * G)\neq11 = Eq(B, 3.5 * L)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2, eq3, eq4, eq5, eq6, eq7, eq8, eq9, eq10, eq11), (A, B, G, J, K, F, M, I, L))\nsolution\nassistant > The solution to the system of inequalities gives us the following values for the letters:\n\n- \\( A = 16 \\)\n- \\( B = 7 \\)\n- \\( G = 5 \\)\n- \\( J = 15 \\)\n- \\( K = 10 \\)\n- \\( F = 24 \\)\n- \\( M = 96 \\)\n- \\( I = 50 \\)\n- \\( L = 2 \\)\n\nNow, we need to assign the remaining numbers 3, 28, 36, 45, and 50 to the letters C, D, E, H, and M. Since M is already assigned 96, we only need to assign the remaining numbers to C, D, E, and H.
