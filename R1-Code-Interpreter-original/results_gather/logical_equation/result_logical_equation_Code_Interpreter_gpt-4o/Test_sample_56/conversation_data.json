    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign each letter a unique number from the given set \\(\\{3, 9, 16, 20, 39, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225\\}\\) such that all the given inequalities and equations are satisfied. Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1. **J + K = 271**: The only pair of numbers that sum to 271 from the set is \\(121 + 150\\). So, \\(J = 121\\) and \\(K = 150\\).\n\n2. **G > I**: We will use this inequality later to check the consistency of our assignments.\n\n3. **E + J = 141**: Since \\(J = 121\\), \\(E = 141 - 121 = 20\\).\n\n4. **A + C = 300**: We will use this equation later to check the consistency of our assignments.\n\n5. **G + K = 230**: Since \\(K = 150\\), \\(G = 230 - 150 = 80\\).\n\n6. **B - K = -141**: Since \\(K = 150\\), \\(B = 150 - 141 = 9\\).\n\n7. **D - C = -209**: We will use this equation later to check the consistency of our assignments.\n\n8. **A + I = 78**: We will use this equation later to check the consistency of our assignments.\n\n9. **F - D = 23**: We will use this equation later to check the consistency of our assignments.\n\n10. **E - H = -28**: Since \\(E = 20\\), \\(H = 20 + 28 = 48\\).\n\n11. **H + K = 198**: Since \\(H = 48\\), \\(K = 198 - 48 = 150\\). This is consistent with our previous assignment for \\(K\\).\n\nNow, let's assign the remaining numbers to the letters and check the consistency of all equations and inequalities.
