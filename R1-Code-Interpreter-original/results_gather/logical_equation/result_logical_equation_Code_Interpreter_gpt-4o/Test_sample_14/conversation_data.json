    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 1, 3, 4, 9, 16, 27, 36, 80, and 121 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I, respectively, while satisfying the given system of equations and inequalities.\n\nLet's solve the system step by step:\n\n1. **A = 3.0E**: This implies that A is three times the value of E.\n\n2. **D + F = 81**: The sum of D and F is 81.\n\n3. **A + D = 28**: The sum of A and D is 28.\n\n4. **C + F = 96**: The sum of C and F is 96.\n\n5. **A + E = 36**: The sum of A and E is 36.\n\n6. **B + E = 12**: The sum of B and E is 12.\n\n7. **B - F = -77**: The difference between B and F is -77.\n\nLet's solve these equations to find the values of A, B, C, D, E, and F. We'll then assign the remaining numbers to G, H, and I.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbols for the letters\nA, B, C, D, E, F = symbols('A B C D E F')\n\n# Define the equations based on the given conditions\neq1 = Eq(A, 3 * E)\neq2 = Eq(D + F, 81)\neq3 = Eq(A + D, 28)\neq4 = Eq(C + F, 96)\neq5 = Eq(A + E, 36)\neq6 = Eq(B + E, 12)\neq7 = Eq(B - F, -77)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2, eq3, eq4, eq5, eq6, eq7), (A, B, C, D, E, F))\nsolution\nassistant > The solution to the system of equations gives us the following values for the letters:\n\n- A = 27\n- B = 3\n- C = 16\n- D = 1\n- E = 9\n- F = 80\n\nNow, we need to assign the remaining numbers 4, 36, and 121 to the letters G, H, and I. Since there are no additional constraints for these letters, we can assign them arbitrarily. Let's assign:\n\n- G = 4\n- H = 36\n- I = 121\n\nThus, the values for the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I in alphabetical order are:\n\n<<<[27, 3, 16, 1, 9, 80, 4, 36, 121]>>>"
