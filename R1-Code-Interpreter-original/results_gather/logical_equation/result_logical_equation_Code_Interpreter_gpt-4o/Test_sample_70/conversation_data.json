    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, and 50 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and M, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities.\n\nLet's break down the constraints and solve them step by step:\n\n1. \\( M = 2.4L \\)\n2. \\( F = 3.0L \\)\n3. \\( E + I = 8 \\)\n4. \\( K - H = -8 \\)\n5. \\( H > I \\)\n6. \\( L + M = 51 \\)\n7. \\( C + J = 9 \\)\n8. \\( G = 2.0I \\)\n9. \\( A - D = 49 \\)\n10. \\( H = 1.5K \\)\n\nWe will use these constraints to find the values of each letter.
