    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, and 96 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and M, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities.\n\nLet's break down the inequalities and solve them step by step:\n\n1. \\( L - I = -23 \\) implies \\( L = I - 23 \\).\n2. \\( I + M = 44 \\).\n3. \\( D + K = 98 \\).\n4. \\( F + I = 73 \\).\n5. \\( F > J \\).\n6. \\( B - C = 26 \\).\n7. \\( B = 2.4A \\).\n8. \\( C + F = 55 \\).\n9. \\( F - J = 38 \\).\n10. \\( H - F = 5 \\).\n11. \\( J = 1.4L \\).\n\nWe will use these equations to find the values of each letter. Let's start by solving the equations that involve fewer variables and use them to find the others.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbols for each letter\nA, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M = symbols('A B C D E F G H I J K L M')\n\n# Define the equations based on the inequalities\neq1 = Eq(L - I, -23)\neq2 = Eq(I + M, 44)\neq3 = Eq(D + K, 98)\neq4 = Eq(F + I, 73)\neq5 = Eq(B - C, 26)\neq6 = Eq(B, 2.4 * A)\neq7 = Eq(C + F, 55)\neq8 = Eq(F - J, 38)\neq9 = Eq(H - F, 5)\neq10 = Eq(J, 1.4 * L)\n\n# Solve the equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2, eq3, eq4, eq5, eq6, eq7, eq8, eq9, eq10), (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M), dict=True)\n\nsolution\nassistant > The solution to the system of equations gives us the following values for the letters:\n\n- \\( A = 15 \\)\n- \\( B = 36 \\)\n- \\( C = 10 \\)\n- \\( F = 45 \\)\n- \\( H = 50 \\)\n- \\( I = 28 \\)\n- \\( J = 7 \\)\n- \\( L = 5 \\)\n- \\( M = 16 \\)\n\nThe value for \\( D \\) and \\( K \\) is not fully determined yet, as it depends on the remaining numbers and the equation \\( D + K = 98 \\).\n\nLet's assign the remaining numbers to \\( D \\), \\( E \\), \\( G \\), and \\( K \\) and check if they satisfy the conditions. The remaining numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, and 96, but some are already used. The unused numbers are 2, 3, 24, and 96. Let's assign these numbers to \\( D \\), \\( E \\), \\( G \\), and \\( K \\) and check the conditions.# Remaining numbers to assign\nremaining_numbers = [2, 3, 24, 96]\n\n# Assign the remaining numbers to D, E, G, and K\n# We know D + K = 98, so we need to find a pair that satisfies this\npossible_assignments = []\nfor d in remaining_numbers:\n    for k in remaining_numbers:\n        if d != k and d + k == 98:\n            possible_assignments.append((d, k))\n\n# Check the possible assignments\npossible_assignments\nassistant > The possible assignments for \\( D \\) and \\( K \\) that satisfy the equation \\( D + K = 98 \\) are:\n\n- \\( D = 2 \\) and \\( K = 96 \\)\n- \\( D = 96 \\) and \\( K = 2 \\)\n\nSince \\( D \\) and \\( K \\) are interchangeable in this context, we can choose one of these assignments. Let's choose \\( D = 2 \\) and \\( K = 96 \\).\n\nNow, the remaining numbers 3 and 24 can be assigned to \\( E \\) and \\( G \\). Let's assign:\n\n- \\( E = 3 \\)\n- \\( G = 24 \\)\n\nNow, let's list the values for each letter in alphabetical order: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M.# Assign the remaining values to E and G\nE = 3\nG = 24\n\n# Final values for each letter\nfinal_values = [15, 36, 10, 2, 3, 45, 24, 50, 28, 7, 96, 5, 16]\nfinal_values\nassistant > The values for each letter in alphabetical order are:\n\n- \\( A = 15 \\)\n- \\( B = 36 \\)\n- \\( C = 10 \\)\n- \\( D = 2 \\)\n- \\( E = 3 \\)\n- \\( F = 45 \\)\n- \\( G = 24 \\)\n- \\( H = 50 \\)\n- \\( I = 28 \\)\n- \\( J = 7 \\)\n- \\( K = 96 \\)\n- \\( L = 5 \\)\n- \\( M = 16 \\)\n\nThus, the list of values is:\n\n\\[\n\\texttt{<<<[15, 36, 10, 2, 3, 45, 24, 50, 28, 7, 96, 5, 16]>>>}\n\\]"
