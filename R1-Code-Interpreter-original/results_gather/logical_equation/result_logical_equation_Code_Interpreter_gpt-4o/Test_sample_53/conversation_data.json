    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 3, 9, 16, 20, 39, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, and 225 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities.\n\nLet's solve the system of equations step by step:\n\n1. \\( F - K = 36 \\)\n2. \\( B - K = 111 \\)\n3. \\( B + E = 230 \\)\n4. \\( H + J = 25 \\)\n5. \\( E - A = 77 \\)\n6. \\( H + I = 36 \\)\n7. \\( C + E = 305 \\)\n8. \\( C - I = 205 \\)\n9. \\( C + J = 234 \\)\n10. \\( G = 3.0H \\)\n11. \\( A + K = 42 \\)\n\nWe will solve these equations to find the values of each letter.
