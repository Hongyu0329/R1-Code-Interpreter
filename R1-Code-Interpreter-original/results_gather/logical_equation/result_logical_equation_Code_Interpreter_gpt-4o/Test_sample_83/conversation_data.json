    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, and 96 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and M, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities.\n\nLet's solve the system step by step:\n\n1. \\( E - D = 25 \\)\n2. \\( H + I = 103 \\)\n3. \\( E = 2.8M \\)\n4. \\( C + I = 120 \\)\n5. \\( A + I = 101 \\)\n6. \\( I - J = 51 \\)\n7. \\( I + J = 141 \\)\n8. \\( H - I = -89 \\)\n9. \\( E = 4.0H \\)\n10. \\( G = 3.0A \\)\n11. \\( G - E = -13 \\)\n\nFrom equations 6 and 7, we can solve for \\( I \\) and \\( J \\):\n- \\( I - J = 51 \\)\n- \\( I + J = 141 \\)\n\nAdding these two equations, we get:\n\\[ 2I = 192 \\]\n\\[ I = 96 \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( I = 96 \\) into \\( I - J = 51 \\):\n\\[ 96 - J = 51 \\]\n\\[ J = 45 \\]\n\nNow, substituting \\( I = 96 \\) into equation 2:\n\\[ H + 96 = 103 \\]\n\\[ H = 7 \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( I = 96 \\) into equation 4:\n\\[ C + 96 = 120 \\]\n\\[ C = 24 \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( I = 96 \\) into equation 5:\n\\[ A + 96 = 101 \\]\n\\[ A = 5 \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( H = 7 \\) into equation 9:\n\\[ E = 4 \\times 7 = 28 \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( E = 28 \\) into equation 1:\n\\[ 28 - D = 25 \\]\n\\[ D = 3 \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( E = 28 \\) into equation 11:\n\\[ G - 28 = -13 \\]\n\\[ G = 15 \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( A = 5 \\) into equation 10:\n\\[ G = 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\] (This is consistent)\n\nSubstituting \\( E = 28 \\) into equation 3:\n\\[ 28 = 2.8M \\]\n\\[ M = 10 \\]\n\nNow, we have the following assignments:\n- \\( A = 5 \\)\n- \\( B = \\) (unknown)\n- \\( C = 24 \\)\n- \\( D = 3 \\)\n- \\( E = 28 \\)\n- \\( F = \\) (unknown)\n- \\( G = 15 \\)\n- \\( H = 7 \\)\n- \\( I = 96 \\)\n- \\( J = 45 \\)\n- \\( K = \\) (unknown)\n- \\( L = \\) (unknown)\n- \\( M = 10 \\)\n\nThe remaining numbers are 2, 16, 36, 50. Let's assign them to the remaining letters B, F, K, and L. Since there are no more constraints, we can assign them arbitrarily:\n\n- \\( B = 2 \\)\n- \\( F = 16 \\)\n- \\( K = 36 \\)\n- \\( L = 50 \\)\n\nNow, let's return the values in alphabetical order:\n\n\\[ \\text{A = 5, B = 2, C = 24, D = 3, E = 28, F = 16, G = 15, H = 7, I = 96, J = 45, K = 36, L = 50, M = 10} \\]\n\nSo the list of values is:\n\n<<<[5, 2, 24, 3, 28, 16, 15, 7, 96, 45, 36, 50, 10]>>>"
