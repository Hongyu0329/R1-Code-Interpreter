    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, and 96 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and M such that all the given equations and inequalities are satisfied.\n\nLet's solve the system of equations step by step:\n\n1. \\( F + J = 15 \\)\n2. \\( F - G = -91 \\)\n3. \\( D = 3.5K \\)\n4. \\( E + G = 141 \\)\n5. \\( A - K = 13 \\)\n6. \\( F + M = 29 \\)\n7. \\( D = 1.4F \\)\n8. \\( L = 4.0D \\)\n9. \\( C = 3.6J \\)\n10. \\( A + M = 39 \\)\n11. \\( C = 2.4A \\)\n\nLet's start by solving these equations systematically. We'll use the given equations to find the values of the letters.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbols for the letters\nA, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M = symbols('A B C D E F G H I J K L M')\n\n# Define the equations based on the given inequalities\neq1 = Eq(F + J, 15)\neq2 = Eq(F - G, -91)\neq3 = Eq(D, 3.5 * K)\neq4 = Eq(E + G, 141)\neq5 = Eq(A - K, 13)\neq6 = Eq(F + M, 29)\neq7 = Eq(D, 1.4 * F)\neq8 = Eq(L, 4.0 * D)\neq9 = Eq(C, 3.6 * J)\neq10 = Eq(A + M, 39)\neq11 = Eq(C, 2.4 * A)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2, eq3, eq4, eq5, eq6, eq7, eq8, eq9, eq10, eq11), (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M), dict=True)\n\nsolution\nassistant > The solution to the system of equations is:\n\n- \\( A = 15 \\)\n- \\( C = 36 \\)\n- \\( D = 7 \\)\n- \\( E = 45 \\)\n- \\( F = 5 \\)\n- \\( G = 96 \\)\n- \\( J = 10 \\)\n- \\( K = 2 \\)\n- \\( L = 28 \\)\n- \\( M = 24 \\)\n\nNow, we need to assign the remaining numbers 3, 16, 50 to the letters B, H, and I. Since these letters are not involved in any equations, we can assign them any of the remaining numbers. Let's assign them in ascending order:\n\n- \\( B = 3 \\)\n- \\( H = 16 \\)\n- \\( I = 50 \\)\n\nThus, the values of the letters in alphabetical order are:\n\n<<<[15, 3, 36, 7, 45, 5, 96, 16, 50, 10, 2, 28, 24]>>>"
