    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, and 96 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and M, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities.\n\nLet's break down the inequalities and solve them step by step:\n\n1. \\( A = 2.8K \\)\n2. \\( A + F = 30 \\)\n3. \\( C + D = 31 \\)\n4. \\( G - L = 45 \\)\n5. \\( L - C = -19 \\)\n6. \\( I = 1.5K \\)\n7. \\( A > D \\)\n8. \\( J + K = 13 \\)\n9. \\( B = 3.6K \\)\n10. \\( C = 1.6I \\)\n11. \\( B + G = 86 \\)\n12. \\( K - J = 7 \\)\n\nWe will use these equations to find the values of the letters. Let's start by solving the equations involving \\( K \\) and then use the results to find the other values.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbols\nA, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M = symbols('A B C D E F G H I J K L M')\n\n# Define the equations based on the inequalities\neq1 = Eq(A, 2.8 * K)\neq2 = Eq(A + F, 30)\neq3 = Eq(C + D, 31)\neq4 = Eq(G - L, 45)\neq5 = Eq(L - C, -19)\neq6 = Eq(I, 1.5 * K)\neq8 = Eq(J + K, 13)\neq9 = Eq(B, 3.6 * K)\neq10 = Eq(C, 1.6 * I)\neq11 = Eq(B + G, 86)\neq12 = Eq(K - J, 7)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2, eq3, eq4, eq5, eq6, eq8, eq9, eq10, eq11, eq12), (A, B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, L))\n\nsolution\nassistant > The solution to the system of equations gives us the following values for the letters:\n\n- \\( A = 28 \\)\n- \\( B = 36 \\)\n- \\( C = 24 \\)\n- \\( D = 7 \\)\n- \\( F = 2 \\)\n- \\( G = 50 \\)\n- \\( I = 15 \\)\n- \\( J = 3 \\)\n- \\( K = 10 \\)\n- \\( L = 5 \\)\n\nNow, we need to assign the remaining numbers 16, 45, and 96 to the letters E, H, and M. Since these letters are not involved in any equations, we can assign them the remaining numbers in any order. Let's assign them as follows:\n\n- \\( E = 16 \\)\n- \\( H = 45 \\)\n- \\( M = 96 \\)\n\nThus, the values for the letters in alphabetical order are:\n\n<<<[28, 36, 24, 7, 16, 2, 50, 45, 15, 3, 10, 5, 96]>>>"
