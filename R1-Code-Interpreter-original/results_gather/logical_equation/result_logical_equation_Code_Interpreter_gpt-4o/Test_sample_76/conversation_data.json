    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, and 96 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and M, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities.\n\nLet's solve the system step by step:\n\n1. \\( I - E = -4 \\) implies \\( I = E - 4 \\).\n2. \\( F = 2.5K \\).\n3. \\( I = 1.5B \\).\n4. \\( L - A = 33 \\) implies \\( L = A + 33 \\).\n5. \\( E = 2.8H \\).\n6. \\( C + M = 111 \\).\n7. \\( L - C = -60 \\) implies \\( L = C - 60 \\).\n8. \\( H = 2.0F \\).\n9. \\( F + L = 41 \\).\n10. \\( K - E = -26 \\) implies \\( K = E - 26 \\).\n11. \\( A + F = 8 \\).\n\nWe will use these equations to find the values of the letters. Let's start by solving the equations systematically.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbols for the letters\nA, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M = symbols('A B C D E F G H I J K L M')\n\n# Define the equations based on the given inequalities\neq1 = Eq(I, E - 4)\neq2 = Eq(F, 2.5 * K)\neq3 = Eq(I, 1.5 * B)\neq4 = Eq(L, A + 33)\neq5 = Eq(E, 2.8 * H)\neq6 = Eq(C + M, 111)\neq7 = Eq(L, C - 60)\neq8 = Eq(H, 2.0 * F)\neq9 = Eq(F + L, 41)\neq10 = Eq(K, E - 26)\neq11 = Eq(A + F, 8)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2, eq3, eq4, eq5, eq6, eq7, eq8, eq9, eq10, eq11), (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M), dict=True)\n\nsolution\nassistant > The solution to the system of inequalities assigns the following values to the letters:\n\n- A = 3\n- B = 16\n- C = 96\n- D = (not used in the equations)\n- E = 28\n- F = 5\n- G = (not used in the equations)\n- H = 10\n- I = 24\n- J = (not used in the equations)\n- K = 2\n- L = 36\n- M = 15\n\nThe numbers 7, 45, 50, and 16 are not used in the equations, so they can be assigned to D, G, and J in any order. However, since the problem does not specify constraints for these letters, we will focus on the letters that are part of the equations.\n\nThus, the list of values in alphabetical order is:\n\n<<<[3, 16, 96, 7, 28, 5, 45, 10, 24, 50, 2, 36, 15]>>>"
