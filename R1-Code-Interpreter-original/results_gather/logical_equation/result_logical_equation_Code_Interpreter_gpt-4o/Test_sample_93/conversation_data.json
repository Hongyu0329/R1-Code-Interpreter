    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, and 96 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and M such that all the given inequalities and equations are satisfied.\n\nLet's solve this step by step:\n\n1. From equation 1: \\( C + E = 141 \\)\n2. From equation 5: \\( E - C = 51 \\)\n\nFrom these two equations, we can solve for \\( C \\) and \\( E \\):\n- Adding the two equations: \\( 2E = 192 \\) gives \\( E = 96 \\)\n- Substituting back: \\( C = 141 - 96 = 45 \\)\n\n3. From equation 2: \\( J + L = 33 \\)\n4. From equation 4: \\( B - J = 10 \\)\n5. From equation 9: \\( J - H = -5 \\) gives \\( J = H + 5 \\)\n6. From equation 10: \\( K - B = 9 \\) gives \\( B = K - 9 \\)\n7. From equation 11: \\( B - M = -1 \\) gives \\( M = B + 1 \\)\n8. From equation 7: \\( M = 3.2J \\)\n\nNow, let's solve these equations and inequalities to find the values of the remaining letters.
