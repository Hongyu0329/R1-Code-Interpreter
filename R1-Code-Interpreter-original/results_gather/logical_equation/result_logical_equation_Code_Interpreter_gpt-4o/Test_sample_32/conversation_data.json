    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 3, 9, 16, 27, 36, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, and 225 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities.\n\nLet's solve the system step by step:\n\n1. \\( D - A = 11 \\)\n2. \\( H + I = 228 \\)\n3. \\( G = 4.0B \\)\n4. \\( I - F = -118 \\)\n5. \\( H - B = 216 \\)\n6. \\( A + G = 52 \\)\n7. \\( F + G = 157 \\)\n8. \\( E = 3.0A \\)\n9. \\( G + I = 39 \\)\n10. \\( C - H = -75 \\)\n\nLet's solve these equations systematically.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbols for each letter\nA, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K = symbols('A B C D E F G H I J K')\n\n# Define the equations based on the given inequalities\neq1 = Eq(D - A, 11)\neq2 = Eq(H + I, 228)\neq3 = Eq(G, 4 * B)\neq4 = Eq(I - F, -118)\neq5 = Eq(H - B, 216)\neq6 = Eq(A + G, 52)\neq7 = Eq(F + G, 157)\neq8 = Eq(E, 3 * A)\neq9 = Eq(G + I, 39)\neq10 = Eq(C - H, -75)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2, eq3, eq4, eq5, eq6, eq7, eq8, eq9, eq10), (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I))\n\nsolution\nassistant > The solution to the system of inequalities is as follows:\n\n- A = 16\n- B = 9\n- C = 150\n- D = 27\n- E = 48\n- F = 121\n- G = 36\n- H = 225\n- I = 3\n\nThe numbers 75, 80, and 150 are left for J and K. Since C is already 150, we need to assign the remaining numbers to J and K.
