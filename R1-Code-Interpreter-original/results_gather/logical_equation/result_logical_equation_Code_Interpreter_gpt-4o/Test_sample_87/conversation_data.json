    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, and 96 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and M, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities.\n\nLet's break down the inequalities and solve them step by step:\n\n1. \\( I - J = -21 \\) implies \\( I = J - 21 \\).\n2. \\( J - D = 14 \\) implies \\( D = J - 14 \\).\n3. \\( K = 3.5H \\).\n4. \\( E = 3.2C \\).\n5. \\( J - H = 22 \\) implies \\( H = J - 22 \\).\n6. \\( M - I = 33 \\) implies \\( M = I + 33 \\).\n7. \\( J = 4.8C \\).\n8. \\( E = 1.6D \\).\n9. \\( I - L = -12 \\) implies \\( L = I + 12 \\).\n10. \\( M = 2.4L \\).\n11. \\( C - E = -11 \\) implies \\( E = C + 11 \\).\n\nLet's solve these equations step by step. We'll start by solving the equations that involve fewer variables and use the results to solve the others.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbols for the letters\nA, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M = symbols('A B C D E F G H I J K L M')\n\n# Define the equations based on the inequalities\neq1 = Eq(I - J, -21)\neq2 = Eq(J - D, 14)\neq3 = Eq(K, 3.5 * H)\neq4 = Eq(E, 3.2 * C)\neq5 = Eq(J - H, 22)\neq6 = Eq(M - I, 33)\neq7 = Eq(J, 4.8 * C)\neq8 = Eq(E, 1.6 * D)\neq9 = Eq(I - L, -12)\neq10 = Eq(M, 2.4 * L)\neq11 = Eq(C - E, -11)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2, eq3, eq4, eq5, eq6, eq7, eq8, eq9, eq10, eq11), (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M), dict=True)\n\nsolution\nassistant > The solution to the system of inequalities gives us the following values for the letters:\n\n- C = 5\n- D = 10\n- E = 16\n- H = 2\n- I = 3\n- J = 24\n- K = 7\n- L = 15\n- M = 36\n\nNow, we need to assign the remaining numbers 28, 45, 50, and 96 to the letters A, B, F, and G. These numbers are not involved in any of the given inequalities, so they can be assigned arbitrarily to the remaining letters.\n\nLet's assign these numbers to the remaining letters in alphabetical order:\n\n- A = 28\n- B = 45\n- F = 50\n- G = 96\n\nNow, let's list the values in alphabetical order starting with A:\n\n- A = 28\n- B = 45\n- C = 5\n- D = 10\n- E = 16\n- F = 50\n- G = 96\n- H = 2\n- I = 3\n- J = 24\n- K = 7\n- L = 15\n- M = 36\n\nThe final list of values is:\n\n<<<[28, 45, 5, 10, 16, 50, 96, 2, 3, 24, 7, 15, 36]>>>"
