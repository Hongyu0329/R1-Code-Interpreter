    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, and 96 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and M, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities.\n\nLet's solve the system step by step:\n\n1. From equation 6, \\( L = 3.5A \\).\n2. From equation 1, \\( A - L = -5 \\), so \\( A = L - 5 \\).\n3. Substitute \\( L = 3.5A \\) into \\( A = L - 5 \\) to find \\( A \\).\n4. From equation 5, \\( C = 2.5A \\).\n5. From equation 2, \\( I = 3.2C \\).\n6. From equation 9, \\( I + M = 40 \\).\n7. From equation 4, \\( L + M = 31 \\).\n8. From equation 3, \\( J + M = 60 \\).\n9. From equation 10, \\( A + D = 98 \\).\n10. From equation 7, \\( D = 4.0M \\).\n11. From equation 12, \\( D + G = 106 \\).\n12. From equation 8, \\( B = 4.5G \\).\n13. From equation 11, \\( F = 1.5G \\).\n\nLet's solve these equations to find the values of each letter.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbols\nA, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M = symbols('A B C D E F G H I J K L M')\n\n# Define the equations based on the given inequalities\neq1 = Eq(A - L, -5)\neq2 = Eq(I, 3.2 * C)\neq3 = Eq(J + M, 60)\neq4 = Eq(L + M, 31)\neq5 = Eq(C, 2.5 * A)\neq6 = Eq(L, 3.5 * A)\neq7 = Eq(D, 4.0 * M)\neq8 = Eq(B, 4.5 * G)\neq9 = Eq(I + M, 40)\neq10 = Eq(A + D, 98)\neq11 = Eq(F, 1.5 * G)\neq12 = Eq(D + G, 106)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2, eq3, eq4, eq5, eq6, eq7, eq8, eq9, eq10, eq11, eq12), (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M))\n\nsolution\nassistant > The solution to the system of inequalities assigns the following values to the letters:\n\n- A = 2\n- B = 45\n- C = 5\n- D = 96\n- F = 15\n- G = 10\n- I = 16\n- J = 36\n- L = 7\n- M = 24\n\nThe letters E, H, and K are not determined by the given equations, so they can be assigned the remaining numbers: 3, 28, and 50.\n\nThus, the values for each letter in alphabetical order are:\n\n<<<[2, 45, 5, 96, 3, 15, 10, 28, 16, 36, 50, 7, 24]>>>"
