    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, and 96 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and M, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities.\n\nLet's solve this step by step:\n\n1. **K - G = 25**: This implies that K is 25 more than G.\n2. **F = 3.5M**: F is 3.5 times M.\n3. **B + E = 141**: The sum of B and E is 141.\n4. **J + K = 38**: The sum of J and K is 38.\n5. **B + I = 50**: The sum of B and I is 50.\n6. **A - G = 33**: A is 33 more than G.\n7. **I + M = 7**: The sum of I and M is 7.\n8. **A - H = -14**: A is 14 less than H.\n9. **M - H = -48**: M is 48 less than H.\n10. **C - E = -72**: C is 72 less than E.\n11. **F = 1.4I**: F is 1.4 times I.\n\nLet's solve these equations systematically.
