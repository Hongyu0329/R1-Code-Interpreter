This could be due to the complexity of the problem or the constraints not being fully compatible with the given set of numbers.\n\nLet's try a different approach by manually analyzing the equations and inequalities to find a consistent assignment of numbers to letters. We'll start by solving the equations that involve direct relationships and then check the inequalities. \n\n1.

From \\( I - C = 31 \\), we have \\( 7.2C - C = 31 \\), which simplifies to \\( 6.2C = 31 \\), giving \\( C = 5 \\).\n4. Substituting \\( C = 5 \\) into \\( F = 3C \\), we get \\( F = 15 \\).\n5. Substituting \\( C = 5 \\) into \\( I = 7.2C \\), we get \\( I = 36 \\).\n6. From \\( D = 4.8C \\), we have \\( D = 24 \\).\n7. From \\( B = 3.2C \\), we have \\( B = 16 \\).\n8. From \\( B = 1.6L \\), we have \\( L = 10 \\).\n9. From \\( H + L = 60 \\), we have \\( H = 50 \\).\n10. From \\( H - B = 34 \\), we have \\( H = 50 \\), which is consistent.\n11. From \\( M = 3.5E \\), we have \\( E = 28 \\).\n12. From \\( G - J = -17 \\), we have \\( G = J - 17 \\).\n\nNow, let's assign the remaining numbers to the letters that are not yet determined, ensuring that all inequalities are satisfied.
