    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, and 96 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and M, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities.\n\nLet's solve the system step by step:\n\n1. From equation 3: \\( J - F = 86 \\), we can deduce that \\( J = F + 86 \\).\n\n2. From equation 2: \\( J - M = 80 \\), we can deduce that \\( M = J - 80 \\).\n\n3. From equation 5: \\( B + M = 31 \\), we can deduce that \\( B = 31 - M \\).\n\n4. From equation 6: \\( B = 1.5F \\), we can deduce that \\( F = \\frac{B}{1.5} \\).\n\n5. From equation 9: \\( G = 3.6F \\).\n\n6. From equation 1: \\( F + G = 46 \\), we can substitute \\( G = 3.6F \\) to get \\( F + 3.6F = 46 \\).\n\n7. From equation 8: \\( L = 1.5M \\).\n\n8. From equation 4: \\( H - L = 26 \\), we can deduce that \\( H = L + 26 \\).\n\n9. From equation 11: \\( L - I = -21 \\), we can deduce that \\( I = L + 21 \\).\n\n10. From equation 7: \\( C = 4.0A \\).\n\n11.
