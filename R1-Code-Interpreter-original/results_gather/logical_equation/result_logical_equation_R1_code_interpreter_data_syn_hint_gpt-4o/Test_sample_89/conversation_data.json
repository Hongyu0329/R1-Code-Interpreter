    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, 96 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M such that all the given inequalities and equations are satisfied.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n\n1. **A - C = 26**: This means A is 26 more than C.\n2. **M > L**: M is greater than L.\n3. **C = 2.0D**: C is twice D.\n4. **E + I = 57**: The sum of E and I is 57.\n5. **L = 1.6C**: L is 1.6 times C.\n6. **G - K = -12**: G is 12 less than K.\n7. **K = 1.5C**: K is 1.5 times C.\n8. **A = 3.6C**: A is 3.6 times C.\n9. **M = 4.8D**: M is 4.8 times D.\n10. **C + F = 106**: The sum of C and F is 106.\n11. **H - G = 42**: H is 42 more than G.\n\nGiven these constraints, we can start by solving for C, D, K, L, A, M, and F, as they are directly related through equations.\n\nLet's write a Python script to find the values of these variables:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Possible values for the letters\nvalues = [2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, 96]\n\n# Iterate over all permutations of the values\nfor perm in permutations(values):\n    A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M = perm\n    \n    # Check all conditions\n    if (A - C == 26 and\n        M > L and\n        C == 2.0 * D and\n        E + I == 57 and\n        L == 1.6 * C and\n        G - K == -12 and\n        K == 1.5 * C and\n        A == 3.6 * C and\n        M == 4.8 * D and\n        C + F == 106 and\n        H - G == 42):\n        \n        # If all conditions are satisfied, print the result\n        print([A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M])\n        break\n```\n\nThis script will iterate over all permutations of the given values and check if they satisfy all the given conditions. Once a valid permutation is found, it will print the values corresponding to each letter in alphabetical order.",
    "The previous approach of using permutations to solve the problem was inefficient due to the large number of permutations (13! = 6,227,020,800). This is why the code timed out. Instead, we should use a more targeted approach by solving the equations and inequalities step by step, reducing the search space significantly.\n\nLet's analyze the constraints again and solve them in a more efficient manner:\n\n1. **A = 3.6C** and **A - C = 26**: From these, we can express A in terms of C and solve for C.\n2. **C = 2.0D**: This gives us a direct relationship between C and D.\n3. **K = 1.5C**: This gives us a direct relationship between K and C.\n4. **L = 1.6C**: This gives us a direct relationship between L and C.\n5. **M = 4.8D**: Since C = 2.0D, we can express M in terms of C.\n6. **E + I = 57**: This is a sum constraint for E and I.\n7. **G - K = -12** and **H - G = 42**: These give us relationships between G, K, and H.\n\nLet's solve these equations step by step:\n\n- From **A = 3.6C** and **A - C = 26**, we have:\n  - \\( A = 3.6C \\)\n  - \\( A = C + 26 \\)\n  - Equating the two expressions for A: \\( 3.6C = C + 26 \\)\n  - Solving for C: \\( 2.6C = 26 \\) => \\( C = 10 \\)\n\n- With \\( C = 10 \\):\n  - \\( A = 3.6 \\times 10 = 36 \\)\n  - \\( D = C / 2 = 5 \\)\n  - \\( K = 1.5 \\times 10 = 15 \\)\n  - \\( L = 1.6 \\times 10 = 16 \\)\n  - \\( M = 4.8 \\times 5 = 24 \\)\n\nNow, let's check the remaining constraints with these values and find the rest:\n\n- **C + F = 106**: \\( F = 106 - 10 = 96 \\)\n- **G - K = -12**: \\( G = K - 12 = 15 - 12 = 3 \\)\n- **H - G = 42**: \\( H = G + 42 = 3 + 42 = 45 \\)\n- **E + I = 57**: We need to find E and I such that their sum is 57.\n\nThe remaining numbers are 2, 7, 28, 50. We need to assign these to B, E, I, J such that E + I = 57. The only pair that sums to 57 is 7 and 50.\n\n- Assign \\( E = 7 \\) and \\( I = 50 \\).\n\nNow, the remaining numbers are 2 and 28, which can be assigned to B and J.\n\nLet's finalize the assignment:\n\n- A = 36\n- B = 2\n- C = 10\n- D = 5\n- E = 7\n- F = 96\n- G = 3\n- H = 45\n- I = 50\n- J = 28\n- K = 15\n- L = 16\n- M = 24\n\nThis satisfies all the constraints. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[36, 2, 10, 5, 7, 96, 3, 45, 50, 28, 15, 16, 24]>>>"
