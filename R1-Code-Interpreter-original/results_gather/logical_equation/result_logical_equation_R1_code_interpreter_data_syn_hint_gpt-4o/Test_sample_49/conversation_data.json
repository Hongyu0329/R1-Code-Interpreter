    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the correct values to each letter based on the given inequalities and equations. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **List of possible values**: 3, 9, 16, 20, 39, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225.\n\n2. **Equations and inequalities**:\n   - A + I = 300\n   - E = 2.4C\n   - G = 3.0K\n   - J > A\n   - A - G = 66\n   - J = 4.0C\n   - I = 3.0A\n   - F = 2.0A\n   - I = 1.5F\n   - A - C = 55\n   - H - A = -59\n\n3. **Solving the equations**:\n   - From equation 7, I = 3.0A, we can express I in terms of A.\n   - From equation 1, A + I = 300, substitute I = 3.0A to get A + 3.0A = 300, which simplifies to 4A = 300, so A = 75.\n   - Substitute A = 75 into I = 3.0A to get I = 225.\n   - From equation 10, A - C = 55, substitute A = 75 to get 75 - C = 55, so C = 20.\n   - From equation 6, J = 4.0C, substitute C = 20 to get J = 80.\n   - From equation 2, E = 2.4C, substitute C = 20 to get E = 48.\n   - From equation 8, F = 2.0A, substitute A = 75 to get F = 150.\n   - From equation 9, I = 1.5F, substitute I = 225 to get 225 = 1.5F, so F = 150 (which is consistent).\n   - From equation 11, H - A = -59, substitute A = 75 to get H - 75 = -59, so H = 16.\n   - From equation 5, A - G = 66, substitute A = 75 to get 75 - G = 66, so G = 9.\n   - From equation 3, G = 3.0K, substitute G = 9 to get 9 = 3.0K, so K = 3.\n\n4. **Assigning the remaining letter**:\n   - The only letter left is B, and the only number left is 39.\n\nNow, let's list the values in alphabetical order:\n\n- A = 75\n- B = 39\n- C = 20\n- D = (not used in equations, but the only number left is 121)\n- E = 48\n- F = 150\n- G = 9\n- H = 16\n- I = 225\n- J = 80\n- K = 3\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[75, 39, 20, 121, 48, 150, 9, 16, 225, 80, 3]>>>"
