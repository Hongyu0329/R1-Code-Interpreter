    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, and 96 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and M, respectively, while satisfying the given inequalities.\n\nLet's break down the constraints and solve them step by step:\n\n1. **G + I = 55**: This means G and I must be two numbers from the list that add up to 55.\n2. **E > D**: E must be greater than D.\n3. **G + L = 57**: G and L must be two numbers from the list that add up to 57.\n4. **G - E = 5**: E is 5 less than G.\n5. **C + H = 27**: C and H must be two numbers from the list that add up to 27.\n6. **A - I = 5**: A is 5 more than I.\n7. **F - I = 91**: F is 91 more than I.\n8. **B - C = -9**: C is 9 more than B.\n9. **K > C**: K must be greater than C.\n10. **H + L = 10**: H and L must be two numbers from the list that add up to 10.\n11. **J - D = 14**: J is 14 more than D.\n12. **B - F = -81**: F is 81 more than B.\n\nWe can start by solving the equations that have direct relationships:\n\n- From **F - I = 91**, since F and I are from the list, and the only numbers that satisfy this are F = 96 and I = 5.\n- From **G + I = 55**, with I = 5, G must be 50.\n- From **G - E = 5**, with G = 50, E must be 45.\n- From **G + L = 57**, with G = 50, L must be 7.\n- From **H + L = 10**, with L = 7, H must be 3.\n- From **C + H = 27**, with H = 3, C must be 24.\n- From **B - C = -9**, with C = 24, B must be 15.\n- From **B - F = -81**, with F = 96, B must be 15 (which is consistent with the previous result).\n- From **A - I = 5**, with I = 5, A must be 10.\n- From **J - D = 14**, we need to find J and D such that J = D + 14.\n- From **E > D**, with E = 45, D must be less than 45.\n- From **K > C**, with C = 24, K must be greater than 24.\n\nNow, let's assign the remaining numbers to the letters:\n\n- The remaining numbers are 2, 28, 36, and 45.\n- D must be less than 45, so D can be 36.\n- J = D + 14 = 36 + 14 = 50, but 50 is already assigned to G, so D must be 28, and J = 28 + 14 = 42.\n- K must be greater than C (24), so K can be 36.\n- The only number left for M is 2.\n\nLet's verify the assignments:\n\n- A = 10\n- B = 15\n- C = 24\n- D = 28\n- E = 45\n- F = 96\n- G = 50\n- H = 3\n- I = 5\n- J = 42\n- K = 36\n- L = 7\n- M = 2\n\nNow, let's check if all constraints are satisfied:\n\n1. G + I = 55: 50 + 5 = 55 ✔\n2. E > D: 45 > 28 ✔\n3. G + L = 57: 50 + 7 = 57 ✔\n4. G - E = 5: 50 - 45 = 5 ✔\n5. C + H = 27: 24 + 3 = 27 ✔\n6. A - I = 5: 10 - 5 = 5 ✔\n7. F - I = 91: 96 - 5 = 91 ✔\n8. B - C = -9: 15 - 24 = -9 ✔\n9. K > C: 36 > 24 ✔\n10. H + L = 10: 3 + 7 = 10 ✔\n11. J - D = 14: 42 - 28 = 14 ✔\n12. B - F = -81: 15 - 96 = -81 ✔\n\nAll constraints are satisfied. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[10, 15, 24, 28, 45, 96, 50, 3, 5, 42, 36, 7, 2]>>>"
