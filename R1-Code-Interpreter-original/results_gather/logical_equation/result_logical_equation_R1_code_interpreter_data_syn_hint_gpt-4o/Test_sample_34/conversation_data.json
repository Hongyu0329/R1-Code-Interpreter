    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the given numbers to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K such that all the given inequalities are satisfied. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **List of numbers**: 3, 9, 16, 27, 36, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225\n2. **Equations and inequalities**:\n   - G = 3.0C\n   - I = 4.0G\n   - A - G = 112\n   - K = 3.0J\n   - B + D = 64\n   - E - B = 11\n   - F = 2.0J\n   - F - C = 147\n   - E - I = -9\n   - A + F = 271\n\nLet's start by solving these equations step by step:\n\n- From G = 3.0C, G must be a multiple of 3. Let's assume C = 27, then G = 3 * 27 = 81, but 81 is not in the list. Let's try C = 16, then G = 3 * 16 = 48, which is in the list.\n- From I = 4.0G, if G = 48, then I = 4 * 48 = 192, but 192 is not in the list. Let's try another value for C.\n- If C = 9, then G = 3 * 9 = 27, which is in the list. Then I = 4 * 27 = 108, but 108 is not in the list.\n- If C = 3, then G = 3 * 3 = 9, which is in the list. Then I = 4 * 9 = 36, which is in the list.\n\nNow, let's check the other equations with these values:\n- A - G = 112, if G = 9, then A = 112 + 9 = 121, which is in the list.\n- K = 3.0J, let's assume J = 50, then K = 3 * 50 = 150, which is in the list.\n- B + D = 64, let's assume B = 36, then D = 64 - 36 = 28, but 28 is not in the list. Let's try B = 27, then D = 64 - 27 = 37, but 37 is not in the list. Let's try B = 16, then D = 64 - 16 = 48, which is in the list.\n- E - B = 11, if B = 16, then E = 16 + 11 = 27, which is in the list.\n- F = 2.0J, if J = 75, then F = 2 * 75 = 150, which is in the list.\n- F - C = 147, if C = 3, then F = 3 + 147 = 150, which is in the list.\n- E - I = -9, if E = 27 and I = 36, then E - I = 27 - 36 = -9, which is satisfied.\n- A + F = 271, if A = 121 and F = 150, then A + F = 121 + 150 = 271, which is satisfied.\n\nNow, let's verify the values:\n- A = 121\n- B = 16\n- C = 3\n- D = 48\n- E = 27\n- F = 150\n- G = 9\n- H = 80 (remaining number)\n- I = 36\n- J = 75\n- K = 225 (remaining number)\n\nLet's write a Python script to verify these values:\n\n```python\n# Given numbers\nnumbers = [3, 9, 16, 27, 36, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225]\n\n# Assigning values to letters\nA = 121\nB = 16\nC = 3\nD = 48\nE = 27\nF = 150\nG = 9\nH = 80\nI = 36\nJ = 75\nK = 225\n\n# Verifying the equations\nequations = [\n    G == 3.0 * C,\n    I == 4.0 * G,\n    A - G == 112,\n    K == 3.0 * J,\n    B + D == 64,\n    E - B == 11,\n    F == 2.0 * J,\n    F - C == 147,\n    E - I == -9,\n    A + F == 271\n]\n\n# Check if all equations are satisfied\nall_satisfied = all(equations)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(all_satisfied)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to verify the solution.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the solution satisfies all the given inequalities. However, let's ensure that the solution is correct by listing the values in alphabetical order and verifying that all numbers are used exactly once.\n\nThe values assigned to each letter are:\n- A = 121\n- B = 16\n- C = 3\n- D = 48\n- E = 27\n- F = 150\n- G = 9\n- H = 80\n- I = 36\n- J = 75\n- K = 225\n\nThese values satisfy all the given inequalities, and each number from the list is used exactly once. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[121, 16, 3, 48, 27, 150, 9, 80, 36, 75, 225]>>>"
