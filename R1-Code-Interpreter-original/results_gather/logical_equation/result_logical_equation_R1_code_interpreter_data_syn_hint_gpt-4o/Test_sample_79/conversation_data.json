    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the given numbers to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M such that all the given equations and inequalities are satisfied. The numbers available are 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, 96.\n\nLet's analyze the constraints:\n\n1. F + J = 15\n2. F - G = -91\n3. D = 3.5K\n4. E + G = 141\n5. A - K = 13\n6. F + M = 29\n7. D = 1.4F\n8. L = 4.0D\n9. C = 3.6J\n10. A + M = 39\n11. C = 2.4A\n\nWe can start by solving some of these equations to find relationships between the variables:\n\n- From equation 2, F - G = -91, we have G = F + 91.\n- From equation 4, E + G = 141, we have E = 141 - G.\n- From equation 5, A - K = 13, we have A = K + 13.\n- From equation 6, F + M = 29, we have M = 29 - F.\n- From equation 7, D = 1.4F.\n- From equation 8, L = 4.0D.\n- From equation 9, C = 3.6J.\n- From equation 10, A + M = 39, we have M = 39 - A.\n- From equation 11, C = 2.4A.\n\nNow, let's use these relationships to find the values of the letters. We will use Python to solve this system of equations and inequalities.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbols\nA, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M = symbols('A B C D E F G H I J K L M')\n\n# Define the equations\neq1 = Eq(F + J, 15)\neq2 = Eq(F - G, -91)\neq3 = Eq(D, 3.5 * K)\neq4 = Eq(E + G, 141)\neq5 = Eq(A - K, 13)\neq6 = Eq(F + M, 29)\neq7 = Eq(D, 1.4 * F)\neq8 = Eq(L, 4.0 * D)\neq9 = Eq(C, 3.6 * J)\neq10 = Eq(A + M, 39)\neq11 = Eq(C, 2.4 * A)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2, eq3, eq4, eq5, eq6, eq7, eq8, eq9, eq10, eq11), (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M))\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the values of the letters.",
    "The previous attempt to solve the system of equations using symbolic computation did not yield a valid solution because the values obtained do not match the given set of numbers. Let's switch to a more systematic approach by manually analyzing the constraints and using logical reasoning to assign the numbers to the letters.\n\nGiven numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, 96.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the constraints:\n\n1. **F + J = 15**: The possible pairs (F, J) from the given numbers that sum to 15 are (5, 10) and (10, 5).\n\n2. **F - G = -91**: This implies G = F + 91. Since F + J = 15, F must be 5 (because 5 + 91 = 96, which is in the list).\n\n3. **D = 3.5K**: This implies D must be a multiple of 3.5. The possible values for K are 2 (since 3.5 * 2 = 7, which is in the list).\n\n4. **E + G = 141**: Since G = 96, E must be 45 (because 45 + 96 = 141).\n\n5. **A - K = 13**: Since K = 2, A must be 15 (because 15 - 2 = 13).\n\n6. **F + M = 29**: Since F = 5, M must be 24 (because 5 + 24 = 29).\n\n7. **D = 1.4F**: Since F = 5, D must be 7 (because 1.4 * 5 = 7).\n\n8. **L = 4.0D**: Since D = 7, L must be 28 (because 4 * 7 = 28).\n\n9. **C = 3.6J**: Since J = 10, C must be 36 (because 3.6 * 10 = 36).\n\n10. **A + M = 39**: Since A = 15 and M = 24, this is satisfied (because 15 + 24 = 39).\n\n11. **C = 2.4A**: Since A = 15, C must be 36 (because 2.4 * 15 = 36).\n\nNow, let's assign the remaining numbers to the remaining letters:\n\n- B, H, and I are left, and the remaining numbers are 3, 16, 50.\n\nSince there are no specific constraints for B, H, and I, we can assign these numbers arbitrarily to these letters.\n\nLet's summarize the assignments:\n\n- A = 15\n- B = 3\n- C = 36\n- D = 7\n- E = 45\n- F = 5\n- G = 96\n- H = 16\n- I = 50\n- J = 10\n- K = 2\n- L = 28\n- M = 24\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[15, 3, 36, 7, 45, 5, 96, 16, 50, 10, 2, 28, 24]>>>"
