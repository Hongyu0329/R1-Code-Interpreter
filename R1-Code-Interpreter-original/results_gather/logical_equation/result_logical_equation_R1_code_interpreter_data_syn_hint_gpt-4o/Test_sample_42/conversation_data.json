    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the given numbers to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K such that all the given inequalities are satisfied. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **List of numbers**: 3, 9, 16, 27, 36, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225\n2. **Equations**:\n   - H + J = 130\n   - C + I = 177\n   - C + G = 75\n   - G = 3.0F\n   - B - E = 150\n   - J - C = -18\n   - E + G = 123\n   - D + F = 96\n   - E + K = 78\n   - H + K = 124\n\nLet's start by solving these equations step by step:\n\n- From equation 3, C + G = 75, we can express G in terms of C: G = 75 - C.\n- From equation 6, J - C = -18, we can express J in terms of C: J = C - 18.\n- From equation 1, H + J = 130, substitute J: H + (C - 18) = 130, so H = 148 - C.\n- From equation 10, H + K = 124, substitute H: (148 - C) + K = 124, so K = C - 24.\n- From equation 9, E + K = 78, substitute K: E + (C - 24) = 78, so E = 102 - C.\n- From equation 5, B - E = 150, substitute E: B - (102 - C) = 150, so B = 252 - C.\n- From equation 7, E + G = 123, substitute E and G: (102 - C) + (75 - C) = 123, so 177 - 2C = 123, which simplifies to C = 27.\n- Now, substitute C = 27 into the expressions for other variables:\n  - G = 75 - 27 = 48\n  - J = 27 - 18 = 9\n  - H = 148 - 27 = 121\n  - K = 27 - 24 = 3\n  - E = 102 - 27 = 75\n  - B = 252 - 27 = 225\n- From equation 4, G = 3.0F, substitute G: 48 = 3.0F, so F = 16.\n- From equation 8, D + F = 96, substitute F: D + 16 = 96, so D = 80.\n- From equation 2, C + I = 177, substitute C: 27 + I = 177, so I = 150.\n\nNow, we have all the values:\n- A = 36 (the only number left)\n- B = 225\n- C = 27\n- D = 80\n- E = 75\n- F = 16\n- G = 48\n- H = 121\n- I = 150\n- J = 9\n- K = 3\n\nLet's verify these values satisfy all the equations and constraints. If they do, we can return the answer.\n\n```python\n# Assigning the values to the letters\nA = 36\nB = 225\nC = 27\nD = 80\nE = 75\nF = 16\nG = 48\nH = 121\nI = 150\nJ = 9\nK = 3\n\n# Verifying the equations\nequations_satisfied = (\n    H + J == 130 and\n    C + I == 177 and\n    C + G == 75 and\n    G == 3.0 * F and\n    B - E == 150 and\n    J - C == -18 and\n    E + G == 123 and\n    D + F == 96 and\n    E + K == 78 and\n    H + K == 124\n)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(equations_satisfied)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to verify if all equations are satisfied.",
    "The code execution result indicates that all the equations are satisfied with the assigned values. Therefore, the solution is correct. Let's summarize the values for each letter in alphabetical order:\n\n- A = 36\n- B = 225\n- C = 27\n- D = 80\n- E = 75\n- F = 16\n- G = 48\n- H = 121\n- I = 150\n- J = 9\n- K = 3\n\nThese values satisfy all the given equations and constraints.
