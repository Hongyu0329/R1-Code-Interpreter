    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the given numbers to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K such that all the given inequalities are satisfied. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the given numbers**: 3, 9, 16, 27, 36, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225.\n\n2. **Analyze the inequalities**:\n   - D - A = 11\n   - H + I = 228\n   - G = 4.0B\n   - I - F = -118\n   - H - B = 216\n   - A + G = 52\n   - F + G = 157\n   - E = 3.0A\n   - G + I = 39\n   - C - H = -75\n\n3. **Approach**:\n   - Start by solving the equations that have direct relationships.\n   - Use the constraints to narrow down the possibilities for each letter.\n   - Check the consistency of the assignments with all the inequalities.\n\nLet's start solving the equations step by step:\n\n- From G = 4.0B, G must be a multiple of 4. The possible values for G are 48, 80, 16, 36, 75, 150, 225. Among these, only 48 and 80 are multiples of 4. So, B could be 12 or 20, but since 12 is not in the list, B must be 9, making G = 36.\n\n- From A + G = 52, and G = 36, we have A = 52 - 36 = 16.\n\n- From D - A = 11, and A = 16, we have D = 16 + 11 = 27.\n\n- From E = 3.0A, and A = 16, we have E = 3 * 16 = 48.\n\n- From F + G = 157, and G = 36, we have F = 157 - 36 = 121.\n\n- From I - F = -118, and F = 121, we have I = 121 - 118 = 3.\n\n- From H + I = 228, and I = 3, we have H = 228 - 3 = 225.\n\n- From H - B = 216, and H = 225, we have B = 225 - 216 = 9.\n\n- From G + I = 39, and G = 36, we have I = 39 - 36 = 3, which is consistent.\n\n- From C - H = -75, and H = 225, we have C = 225 - 75 = 150.\n\nNow, we have the values for A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I. The remaining numbers are 75 and 80, which must be assigned to J and K. Since there are no constraints on J and K, we can assign them arbitrarily.\n\nLet's summarize the values:\n- A = 16\n- B = 9\n- C = 150\n- D = 27\n- E = 48\n- F = 121\n- G = 36\n- H = 225\n- I = 3\n- J = 75\n- K = 80\n\nNow, let's return the answer in the required format:\n\n<<<[16, 9, 150, 27, 48, 121, 36, 225, 3, 75, 80]>>>"
