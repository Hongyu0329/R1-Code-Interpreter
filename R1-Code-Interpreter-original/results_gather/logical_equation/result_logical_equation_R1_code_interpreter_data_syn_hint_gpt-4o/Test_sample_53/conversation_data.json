    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the given numbers to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K such that all the inequalities are satisfied. The numbers available are 3, 9, 16, 20, 39, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, and 225.\n\nLet's break down the inequalities and solve them step by step:\n\n1. **F - K = 36**: This implies F = K + 36.\n2. **B - K = 111**: This implies B = K + 111.\n3. **B + E = 230**: We can use the value of B from the previous step to find E.\n4. **H + J = 25**: This gives us a direct relationship between H and J.\n5. **E - A = 77**: This implies E = A + 77.\n6. **H + I = 36**: This gives us another relationship between H and I.\n7. **C + E = 305**: We can use the value of E from step 3 to find C.\n8. **C - I = 205**: This gives us a relationship between C and I.\n9. **C + J = 234**: We can use the value of J from step 4 to find C.\n10. **G = 3.0H**: This gives us a direct relationship between G and H.\n11. **A + K = 42**: This implies K = 42 - A.\n\nWe will use these equations to find the values of each letter. Let's write a Python script to solve these equations and find the values of the letters.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbols\nA, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K = symbols('A B C D E F G H I J K')\n\n# Define the equations based on the inequalities\neq1 = Eq(F - K, 36)\neq2 = Eq(B - K, 111)\neq3 = Eq(B + E, 230)\neq4 = Eq(H + J, 25)\neq5 = Eq(E - A, 77)\neq6 = Eq(H + I, 36)\neq7 = Eq(C + E, 305)\neq8 = Eq(C - I, 205)\neq9 = Eq(C + J, 234)\neq10 = Eq(G, 3 * H)\neq11 = Eq(A + K, 42)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2, eq3, eq4, eq5, eq6, eq7, eq8, eq9, eq10, eq11), (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K))\n\n# Extract the values in alphabetical order\nresult = [solution[A], solution[B], solution[C], solution[D], solution[E], solution[F], solution[G], solution[H], solution[I], solution[J], solution[K]]\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis script will solve the system of equations and provide the values for each letter in alphabetical order. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The error indicates that the solution does not contain a value for the letter D, which is expected because there is no equation involving D. We should focus on solving for the letters that are involved in the equations. Let's refine our approach by focusing on the equations that involve the given numbers and solve them step by step.\n\nWe will use the given numbers: 3, 9, 16, 20, 39, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, and 225, and try to assign them to the letters based on the constraints provided.\n\nLet's proceed with a more systematic approach to solve the equations:\n\n1. **F - K = 36**: F = K + 36\n2. **B - K = 111**: B = K + 111\n3. **B + E = 230**: E = 230 - B\n4. **H + J = 25**: J = 25 - H\n5. **E - A = 77**: A = E - 77\n6. **H + I = 36**: I = 36 - H\n7. **C + E = 305**: C = 305 - E\n8. **C - I = 205**: I = C - 205\n9. **C + J = 234**: J = 234 - C\n10. **G = 3.0H**: G = 3 * H\n11. **A + K = 42**: K = 42 - A\n\nWe will use these relationships to find the values of the letters. Let's write a Python script to solve these equations and find the values of the letters.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Given numbers\nnumbers = [3, 9, 16, 20, 39, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225]\n\n# Iterate over all permutations of the numbers\nfor perm in permutations(numbers):\n    A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K = perm\n    \n    # Check all the conditions\n    if (F - K == 36 and\n        B - K == 111 and\n        B + E == 230 and\n        H + J == 25 and\n        E - A == 77 and\n        H + I == 36 and\n        C + E == 305 and\n        C - I == 205 and\n        C + J == 234 and\n        G == 3 * H and\n        A + K == 42):\n        \n        # If all conditions are satisfied, print the result\n        result = [A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K]\n        print(result)\n        break\n```\n\nThis script will iterate over all permutations of the given numbers and check if they satisfy all the conditions.
