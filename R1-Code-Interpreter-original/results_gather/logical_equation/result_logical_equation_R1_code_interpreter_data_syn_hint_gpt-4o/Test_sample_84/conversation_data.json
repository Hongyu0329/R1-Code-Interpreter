    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the given numbers to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and M such that all the given inequalities are satisfied. The numbers available are 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, and 96.\n\nLet's analyze the inequalities:\n\n1. \\( B = 1.4G \\)\n2. \\( A = 3.2G \\)\n3. \\( J = 3.0G \\)\n4. \\( A = 1.6K \\)\n5. \\( A + J = 31 \\)\n6. \\( A + B = 23 \\)\n7. \\( F = 2.4K \\)\n8. \\( M - B = 89 \\)\n9. \\( I - B = 43 \\)\n10. \\( F = 4.8G \\)\n11. \\( B = 3.5L \\)\n\nFrom these equations, we can derive some relationships:\n\n- From equation 5, \\( A + J = 31 \\), and from equations 2 and 3, we have \\( A = 3.2G \\) and \\( J = 3.0G \\). Therefore, \\( 3.2G + 3.0G = 31 \\), which gives \\( G = 5 \\).\n\n- Substituting \\( G = 5 \\) into equations 1, 2, and 3:\n  - \\( B = 1.4 \\times 5 = 7 \\)\n  - \\( A = 3.2 \\times 5 = 16 \\)\n  - \\( J = 3.0 \\times 5 = 15 \\)\n\n- From equation 4, \\( A = 1.6K \\), we have \\( 16 = 1.6K \\), so \\( K = 10 \\).\n\n- From equation 7, \\( F = 2.4K \\), we have \\( F = 2.4 \\times 10 = 24 \\).\n\n- From equation 8, \\( M - B = 89 \\), we have \\( M = 89 + 7 = 96 \\).\n\n- From equation 9, \\( I - B = 43 \\), we have \\( I = 43 + 7 = 50 \\).\n\n- From equation 10, \\( F = 4.8G \\), we have \\( F = 4.8 \\times 5 = 24 \\), which is consistent.\n\n- From equation 11, \\( B = 3.5L \\), we have \\( 7 = 3.5L \\), so \\( L = 2 \\).\n\nNow, we have assigned values to A, B, F, G, I, J, K, L, and M. The remaining letters are C, D, E, and H, and the remaining numbers are 3, 5, 28, 36, and 45. We need to assign these numbers to the remaining letters.\n\nSince there are no specific constraints for C, D, E, and H, we can assign the remaining numbers arbitrarily to these letters. Let's assign them as follows:\n\n- C = 3\n- D = 5\n- E = 28\n- H = 36\n\nNow, let's list the values in alphabetical order:\n\n- A = 16\n- B = 7\n- C = 3\n- D = 5\n- E = 28\n- F = 24\n- G = 5\n- H = 36\n- I = 50\n- J = 15\n- K = 10\n- L = 2\n- M = 96\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[16, 7, 3, 5, 28, 24, 5, 36, 50, 15, 10, 2, 96]>>>"
