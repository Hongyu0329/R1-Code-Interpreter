    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 1, 3, 4, 9, 16, 27, 36, 80, 121 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I such that all the given inequalities and equations are satisfied.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n\n1. A + E = 107\n2. D + H = 137\n3. H > C\n4. A + B = 63\n5. E - F = 79\n6. B + E = 116\n7. B - D = -85\n\nWe can start by solving some of these equations:\n\n- From equation 4: A + B = 63\n- From equation 6: B + E = 116\n- From equation 7: B - D = -85\n\nWe can express some variables in terms of others:\n\n- From equation 7: D = B + 85\n- From equation 6: E = 116 - B\n- From equation 4: A = 63 - B\n\nSubstitute E in equation 1:\n\n- A + E = 107 becomes (63 - B) + (116 - B) = 107\n- Simplifying gives: 179 - 2B = 107\n- 2B = 72\n- B = 36\n\nNow we can find other values:\n\n- A = 63 - B = 63 - 36 = 27\n- E = 116 - B = 116 - 36 = 80\n- D = B + 85 = 36 + 85 = 121\n\nNow we have:\n\n- A = 27\n- B = 36\n- E = 80\n- D = 121\n\nSubstitute D and H in equation 2:\n\n- D + H = 137 becomes 121 + H = 137\n- H = 16\n\nNow we have:\n\n- H = 16\n\nFrom equation 5:\n\n- E - F = 79 becomes 80 - F = 79\n- F = 1\n\nNow we have:\n\n- F = 1\n\nNow we need to assign the remaining numbers 3, 4, 9 to C, G, I such that H > C. Since H = 16, C must be less than 16. The possible values for C are 3, 4, and 9. We can choose C = 9, G = 4, and I = 3.\n\nNow we have:\n\n- C = 9\n- G = 4\n- I = 3\n\nLet's verify all constraints:\n\n1. A + E = 27 + 80 = 107 (satisfied)\n2. D + H = 121 + 16 = 137 (satisfied)\n3. H > C: 16 > 9 (satisfied)\n4. A + B = 27 + 36 = 63 (satisfied)\n5. E - F = 80 - 1 = 79 (satisfied)\n6. B + E = 36 + 80 = 116 (satisfied)\n7. B - D = 36 - 121 = -85 (satisfied)\n\nAll constraints are satisfied. Therefore, the values for the letters are:\n\n- A = 27\n- B = 36\n- C = 9\n- D = 121\n- E = 80\n- F = 1\n- G = 4\n- H = 16\n- I = 3\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[27, 36, 9, 121, 80, 1, 4, 16, 3]>>>"
