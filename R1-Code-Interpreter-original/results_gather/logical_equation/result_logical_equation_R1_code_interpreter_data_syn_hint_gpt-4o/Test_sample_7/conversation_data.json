    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 1, 3, 4, 9, 16, 27, 36, 80, and 121 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I, respectively, while satisfying the given system of equations and inequalities.\n\nLet's analyze the constraints:\n\n1. \\( D + H = 13 \\)\n2. \\( E - C = 15 \\)\n3. \\( C + H = 5 \\)\n4. \\( H = 4.0C \\)\n5. \\( H - B = -117 \\)\n6. \\( F = 3.0C \\)\n7. \\( F + H = 7 \\)\n\nFrom these equations, we can derive some relationships:\n\n- From equation 4, \\( H = 4C \\).\n- From equation 3, \\( C + H = 5 \\), substituting \\( H = 4C \\) gives \\( C + 4C = 5 \\), so \\( 5C = 5 \\), thus \\( C = 1 \\).\n- Substituting \\( C = 1 \\) into \\( H = 4C \\) gives \\( H = 4 \\).\n- From equation 5, \\( H - B = -117 \\), substituting \\( H = 4 \\) gives \\( 4 - B = -117 \\), so \\( B = 121 \\).\n- From equation 6, \\( F = 3C \\), substituting \\( C = 1 \\) gives \\( F = 3 \\).\n- From equation 7, \\( F + H = 7 \\), substituting \\( F = 3 \\) and \\( H = 4 \\) gives \\( 3 + 4 = 7 \\), which is consistent.\n- From equation 2, \\( E - C = 15 \\), substituting \\( C = 1 \\) gives \\( E - 1 = 15 \\), so \\( E = 16 \\).\n- From equation 1, \\( D + H = 13 \\), substituting \\( H = 4 \\) gives \\( D + 4 = 13 \\), so \\( D = 9 \\).\n\nNow, we have the following assignments:\n- \\( C = 1 \\)\n- \\( H = 4 \\)\n- \\( B = 121 \\)\n- \\( F = 3 \\)\n- \\( E = 16 \\)\n- \\( D = 9 \\)\n\nThe remaining numbers are 27, 36, 80, and the remaining letters are A, G, I. We need to assign these numbers to these letters.\n\nSince there are no constraints on A, G, and I, we can assign the remaining numbers arbitrarily to these letters. Let's assign:\n- \\( A = 27 \\)\n- \\( G = 36 \\)\n- \\( I = 80 \\)\n\nNow, let's list the values in alphabetical order: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I.\n\nThe final list of values is:\n- A = 27\n- B = 121\n- C = 1\n- D = 9\n- E = 16\n- F = 3\n- G = 36\n- H = 4\n- I = 80\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<[27, 121, 1, 9, 16, 3, 36, 4, 80]>>>"
