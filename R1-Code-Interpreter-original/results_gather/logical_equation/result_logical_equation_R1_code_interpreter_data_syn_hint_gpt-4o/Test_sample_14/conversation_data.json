    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 1, 3, 4, 9, 16, 27, 36, 80, and 121 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I, respectively, while satisfying the given system of equations.\n\nLet's analyze the equations:\n\n1. \\( A = 3.0 \\times E \\)\n2. \\( D + F = 81 \\)\n3. \\( A + D = 28 \\)\n4. \\( C + F = 96 \\)\n5. \\( A + E = 36 \\)\n6. \\( B + E = 12 \\)\n7. \\( B - F = -77 \\)\n\nFrom equation 7, we have:\n\\[ B = F - 77 \\]\n\nFrom equation 6, we have:\n\\[ B = 12 - E \\]\n\nEquating the two expressions for B:\n\\[ F - 77 = 12 - E \\]\n\\[ F = 89 - E \\]\n\nSubstitute \\( F = 89 - E \\) into equation 2:\n\\[ D + (89 - E) = 81 \\]\n\\[ D = E - 8 \\]\n\nSubstitute \\( D = E - 8 \\) into equation 3:\n\\[ A + (E - 8) = 28 \\]\n\\[ A = 36 - E \\]\n\nSubstitute \\( A = 36 - E \\) into equation 5:\n\\[ (36 - E) + E = 36 \\]\nThis equation is always true, so it doesn't provide new information.\n\nSubstitute \\( A = 36 - E \\) into equation 1:\n\\[ 36 - E = 3.0 \\times E \\]\n\\[ 36 = 4E \\]\n\\[ E = 9 \\]\n\nNow, we can find the values of other variables:\n- \\( A = 36 - 9 = 27 \\)\n- \\( D = 9 - 8 = 1 \\)\n- \\( F = 89 - 9 = 80 \\)\n- \\( B = 12 - 9 = 3 \\)\n\nNow, substitute \\( F = 80 \\) into equation 4:\n\\[ C + 80 = 96 \\]\n\\[ C = 16 \\]\n\nNow, we have the values for A, B, C, D, E, and F. The remaining numbers are 4, 36, and 121, which must be assigned to G, H, and I. Since there are no constraints on G, H, and I, we can assign these numbers arbitrarily.\n\nLet's summarize the values:\n- A = 27\n- B = 3\n- C = 16\n- D = 1\n- E = 9\n- F = 80\n- G = 4\n- H = 36\n- I = 121\n\nThus, the list of values in alphabetical order is:\n<<<[27, 3, 16, 1, 9, 80, 4, 36, 121]>>>"
