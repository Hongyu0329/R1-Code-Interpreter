    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the given numbers to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M such that all the inequalities are satisfied. We will use the given inequalities to deduce the values step by step.\n\nLet's analyze the inequalities:\n\n1. \\( D = 3.0L \\)\n2. \\( F + L = 17 \\)\n3. \\( I + J = 33 \\)\n4. \\( I - D = -17 \\)\n5. \\( I - E = 21 \\)\n6. \\( D - C = 29 \\)\n7. \\( A = 4.0B \\)\n8. \\( F - C = -14 \\)\n9. \\( L = 3.0J \\)\n10. \\( L - D = -30 \\)\n11. \\( F - B = -22 \\)\n\nWe will start by solving these equations step by step:\n\n- From equation 10, \\( L - D = -30 \\), we can express \\( D = L + 30 \\).\n- From equation 1, \\( D = 3.0L \\), we can express \\( L = D/3 \\).\n- Combining these two, we get \\( D = (D/3) + 30 \\). Solving for \\( D \\), we find \\( D = 45 \\).\n- Substituting \\( D = 45 \\) into \\( L = D/3 \\), we get \\( L = 15 \\).\n- From equation 2, \\( F + L = 17 \\), substituting \\( L = 15 \\), we get \\( F = 2 \\).\n- From equation 11, \\( F - B = -22 \\), substituting \\( F = 2 \\), we get \\( B = 24 \\).\n- From equation 7, \\( A = 4.0B \\), substituting \\( B = 24 \\), we get \\( A = 96 \\).\n- From equation 6, \\( D - C = 29 \\), substituting \\( D = 45 \\), we get \\( C = 16 \\).\n- From equation 8, \\( F - C = -14 \\), substituting \\( F = 2 \\) and \\( C = 16 \\), this equation is satisfied.\n- From equation 9, \\( L = 3.0J \\), substituting \\( L = 15 \\), we get \\( J = 5 \\).\n- From equation 3, \\( I + J = 33 \\), substituting \\( J = 5 \\), we get \\( I = 28 \\).\n- From equation 4, \\( I - D = -17 \\), substituting \\( I = 28 \\) and \\( D = 45 \\), this equation is satisfied.\n- From equation 5, \\( I - E = 21 \\), substituting \\( I = 28 \\), we get \\( E = 7 \\).\n\nNow, we have the values for A, B, C, D, E, F, I, J, and L. The remaining letters G, H, K, and M can be assigned the remaining numbers 3, 10, 36, and 50, respectively, as they do not appear in any equations.\n\nLet's verify the solution by checking if all inequalities are satisfied and then return the values in alphabetical order.\n\n```python\n# Assigning the values based on the deductions\nA = 96\nB = 24\nC = 16\nD = 45\nE = 7\nF = 2\nG = 3\nH = 10\nI = 28\nJ = 5\nK = 36\nL = 15\nM = 50\n\n# Check if all inequalities are satisfied\ninequalities_satisfied = (\n    D == 3.0 * L and\n    F + L == 17 and\n    I + J == 33 and\n    I - D == -17 and\n    I - E == 21 and\n    D - C == 29 and\n    A == 4.0 * B and\n    F - C == -14 and\n    L == 3.0 * J and\n    L - D == -30 and\n    F - B == -22\n)\n\n# Print the result if all inequalities are satisfied\nif inequalities_satisfied:\n    result = [A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M]\n    print(result)\nelse:\n    print(\"Inequalities not satisfied\")\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to verify the solution.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the inequalities are satisfied with the given assignments. Let's verify the solution step by step to ensure that all constraints are met:\n\n1. \\( D = 3.0L \\): \\( 45 = 3 \\times 15 \\) is true.\n2. \\( F + L = 17 \\): \\( 2 + 15 = 17 \\) is true.\n3. \\( I + J = 33 \\): \\( 28 + 5 = 33 \\) is true.\n4. \\( I - D = -17 \\): \\( 28 - 45 = -17 \\) is true.\n5. \\( I - E = 21 \\): \\( 28 - 7 = 21 \\) is true.\n6. \\( D - C = 29 \\): \\( 45 - 16 = 29 \\) is true.\n7. \\( A = 4.0B \\): \\( 96 = 4 \\times 24 \\) is true.\n8. \\( F - C = -14 \\): \\( 2 - 16 = -14 \\) is true.\n9. \\( L = 3.0J \\): \\( 15 = 3 \\times 5 \\) is true.\n10. \\( L - D = -30 \\): \\( 15 - 45 = -30 \\) is true.\n11. \\( F - B = -22 \\): \\( 2 - 24 = -22 \\) is true.\n\nAll inequalities are satisfied with the assignments.
