    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, 96 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M such that all the given inequalities and equations are satisfied.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n\n1. C + E = 141\n2. J + L = 33\n3. K = 2.4H\n4. B - J = 10\n5. E - C = 51\n6. C > F\n7. M = 3.2J\n8. E + K = 120\n9. J - H = -5\n10. K - B = 9\n11. B - M = -1\n12. C > M\n\nFrom these constraints, we can derive some relationships:\n\n- From (1) and (5), we have E = C + 51. Substituting in (1), C + (C + 51) = 141, so 2C + 51 = 141, which gives C = 45. Therefore, E = 96.\n- From (4), B = J + 10.\n- From (7), M = 3.2J.\n- From (9), J = H - 5.\n- From (10), K = B + 9.\n- From (11), B = M - 1.\n\nNow, let's use these relationships to find the values of the letters:\n\n- We know C = 45 and E = 96.\n- From (2), J + L = 33. We need to find J and L such that this equation holds.\n- From (3), K = 2.4H.\n- From (8), E + K = 120, so 96 + K = 120, which gives K = 24.\n- From (10), K = B + 9, so B = K - 9 = 24 - 9 = 15.\n- From (4), B = J + 10, so J = B - 10 = 15 - 10 = 5.\n- From (9), J = H - 5, so H = J + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10.\n- From (3), K = 2.4H, so 24 = 2.4 * 10, which is consistent.\n- From (7), M = 3.2J, so M = 3.2 * 5 = 16.\n- From (11), B = M - 1, so 15 = 16 - 1, which is consistent.\n- From (2), J + L = 33, so L = 33 - J = 33 - 5 = 28.\n- From (6), C > F, so F must be less than 45.\n- From (12), C > M, so 45 > 16, which is consistent.\n\nNow, we have the following assignments:\n- A = 2\n- B = 15\n- C = 45\n- D = 3\n- E = 96\n- F = 7\n- G = 5\n- H = 10\n- I = 36\n- J = 5\n- K = 24\n- L = 28\n- M = 16\n\nLet's verify if all constraints are satisfied with these assignments:\n\n1. C + E = 45 + 96 = 141 ✔\n2. J + L = 5 + 28 = 33 ✔\n3. K = 2.4H = 2.4 * 10 = 24 ✔\n4. B - J = 15 - 5 = 10 ✔\n5. E - C = 96 - 45 = 51 ✔\n6. C > F = 45 > 7 ✔\n7. M = 3.2J = 3.2 * 5 = 16 ✔\n8. E + K = 96 + 24 = 120 ✔\n9. J - H = 5 - 10 = -5 ✔\n10. K - B = 24 - 15 = 9 ✔\n11. B - M = 15 - 16 = -1 ✔\n12. C > M = 45 > 16 ✔\n\nAll constraints are satisfied. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[2, 15, 45, 3, 96, 7, 5, 10, 36, 5, 24, 28, 16]>>>"
