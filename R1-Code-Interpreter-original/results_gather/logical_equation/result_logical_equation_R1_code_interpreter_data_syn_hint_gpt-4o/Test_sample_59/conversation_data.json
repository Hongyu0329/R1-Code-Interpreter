    "The previous attempts to solve the problem using symbolic computation did not yield the correct results, likely due to the complexity of the constraints and the need for a more strategic approach. Let's switch to a more systematic reasoning process to solve the problem.\n\n### Systematic Reasoning:\n\n1. **List of Numbers**: 3, 9, 16, 20, 39, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - K > A\n   - H = 2.4A\n   - H = 3.0F\n   - B - I = -216\n   - C - J = -72\n   - I = 1.5G\n   - I = 3.0J\n   - B - H = -39\n   - D - I = -104\n   - J - F = 59\n   - B - F = -7\n\n3. **Direct Deductions**:\n   - From H = 2.4A and H = 3.0F, we have 2.4A = 3.0F, which implies A = 1.25F.\n   - From I = 3.0J, we have I = 3J.\n   - From I = 1.5G, we have G = (2/3)I.\n\n4. **Step-by-step Assignment**:\n   - Start with the equations that have direct relationships and solve for those variables.\n   - Use the solved values to find the remaining variables.\n\nLet's manually deduce the values:\n\n- **H = 3.0F**: Choose F = 48 (since 48 is divisible by 3), then H = 3 * 48 = 144. But 144 is not in the list, so let's try another approach.\n- **I = 3.0J**: Choose J = 75, then I = 3 * 75 = 225.\n- **B - I = -216**: B = 225 - 216 = 9.\n- **B - F = -7**: F = B + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16.\n- **J - F = 59**: J = F + 59 = 16 + 59 = 75 (consistent with our choice for J).\n- **H = 3.0F**: H = 3 * 16 = 48.\n- **H = 2.4A**: A = H / 2.4 = 48 / 2.4 = 20.\n- **D - I = -104**: D = I - 104 = 225 - 104 = 121.\n- **I = 1.5G**: G = I / 1.5 = 225 / 1.5 = 150.\n- **C - J = -72**: C = J - 72 = 75 - 72 = 3.\n- **K > A**: Choose K = 39 (since it's greater than A = 20).\n\nNow, let's list the values in alphabetical order:\n\n- A = 20\n- B = 9\n- C = 3\n- D = 121\n- E = 80 (remaining number)\n- F = 16\n- G = 150\n- H = 48\n- I = 225\n- J = 75\n- K = 39\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[20, 9, 3, 121, 80, 16, 150, 48, 225, 75, 39]>>>"
