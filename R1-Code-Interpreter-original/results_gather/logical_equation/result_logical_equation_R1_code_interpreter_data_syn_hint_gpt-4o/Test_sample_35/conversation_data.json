    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the given numbers to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K such that all the given inequalities are satisfied. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the relationships and constraints:**\n   - E = 1.5K\n   - D + I = 155\n   - K = 2.0D\n   - E = 3.0D\n   - D - C = -46\n   - F + H = 51\n   - H + I = 83\n   - F = 3.0G\n   - E + K = 375\n   - F - D = -27\n\n2. **Substitute and simplify:**\n   - From E = 3.0D and E = 1.5K, we can equate 3.0D = 1.5K, which simplifies to K = 2.0D.\n   - From E = 3.0D and E + K = 375, we have 3.0D + 2.0D = 375, which simplifies to 5.0D = 375, giving D = 75.\n   - Using D = 75 in K = 2.0D, we get K = 150.\n   - Using D = 75 in E = 3.0D, we get E = 225.\n   - Using D = 75 in D - C = -46, we get C = 121.\n   - Using D = 75 in F - D = -27, we get F = 48.\n   - Using F = 48 in F = 3.0G, we get G = 16.\n   - Using F = 48 in F + H = 51, we get H = 3.\n   - Using H = 3 in H + I = 83, we get I = 80.\n   - Using D = 75 and I = 80 in D + I = 155, the equation is satisfied.\n\n3. **Assign the remaining numbers:**\n   - The numbers 3, 9, 16, 27, 36, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225 have been assigned to H, B, G, J, A, F, D, I, C, K, E respectively.\n   - The only number left is 9, which we assign to B.\n\n4. **Compile the final list:**\n   - A = 27\n   - B = 9\n   - C = 121\n   - D = 75\n   - E = 225\n   - F = 48\n   - G = 16\n   - H = 3\n   - I = 80\n   - J = 36\n   - K = 150\n\nNow, let's return the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<[27, 9, 121, 75, 225, 48, 16, 3, 80, 36, 150]>>>"
