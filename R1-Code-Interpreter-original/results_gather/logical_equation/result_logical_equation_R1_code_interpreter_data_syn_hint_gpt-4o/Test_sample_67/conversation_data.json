    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M such that all the given inequalities and equations are satisfied.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n\n1. \\( D - K = 23 \\)\n2. \\( L = 3.6A \\)\n3. \\( A + H = 25 \\)\n4. \\( K = 2.5C \\)\n5. \\( B > F \\)\n6. \\( E = 2.4A \\)\n7. \\( H = 1.5A \\)\n8. \\( I - G = -42 \\)\n9. \\( I - E = -21 \\)\n10. \\( L = 1.5E \\)\n\nWe will use these constraints to deduce the values of each letter. Let's start by analyzing the constraints:\n\n- From constraint 3 and 7, we have \\( H = 1.5A \\) and \\( A + H = 25 \\). Substituting \\( H = 1.5A \\) into \\( A + H = 25 \\), we get:\n  \\[\n  A + 1.5A = 25 \\implies 2.5A = 25 \\implies A = 10\n  \\]\n  Therefore, \\( H = 1.5 \\times 10 = 15 \\).\n\n- From constraint 6, \\( E = 2.4A = 2.4 \\times 10 = 24 \\).\n\n- From constraint 10, \\( L = 1.5E = 1.5 \\times 24 = 36 \\).\n\n- From constraint 2, \\( L = 3.6A = 3.6 \\times 10 = 36 \\). This is consistent with our previous calculation for \\( L \\).\n\n- From constraint 9, \\( I - E = -21 \\), so \\( I = E - 21 = 24 - 21 = 3 \\).\n\n- From constraint 8, \\( I - G = -42 \\), so \\( G = I + 42 = 3 + 42 = 45 \\).\n\n- From constraint 4, \\( K = 2.5C \\). We need to find values for \\( C \\) and \\( K \\) such that \\( K = 2.5C \\) and both are in the list of available numbers. Let's try \\( C = 2 \\), then \\( K = 2.5 \\times 2 = 5 \\).\n\n- From constraint 1, \\( D - K = 23 \\), so \\( D = K + 23 = 5 + 23 = 28 \\).\n\n- We have used the numbers 3, 5, 10, 15, 24, 28, 36, 45. The remaining numbers are 1, 2, 7, 16, 50.\n\n- From constraint 5, \\( B > F \\). We can assign \\( B = 50 \\) and \\( F = 7 \\).\n\n- The remaining numbers are 1 and 16, which we can assign to \\( J \\) and \\( M \\) in any order. Let's assign \\( J = 1 \\) and \\( M = 16 \\).\n\nNow, let's list the values for each letter in alphabetical order:\n\n- A = 10\n- B = 50\n- C = 2\n- D = 28\n- E = 24\n- F = 7\n- G = 45\n- H = 15\n- I = 3\n- J = 1\n- K = 5\n- L = 36\n- M = 16\n\nLet's verify these values satisfy all the constraints:\n\n1. \\( D - K = 28 - 5 = 23 \\) ✔\n2. \\( L = 3.6A = 36 \\) ✔\n3. \\( A + H = 10 + 15 = 25 \\) ✔\n4. \\( K = 2.5C = 5 \\) ✔\n5. \\( B > F = 50 > 7 \\) ✔\n6. \\( E = 2.4A = 24 \\) ✔\n7. \\( H = 1.5A = 15 \\) ✔\n8. \\( I - G = 3 - 45 = -42 \\) ✔\n9. \\( I - E = 3 - 24 = -21 \\) ✔\n10. \\( L = 1.5E = 36 \\) ✔\n\nAll constraints are satisfied. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[10, 50, 2, 28, 24, 7, 45, 15, 3, 1, 5, 36, 16]>>>"
