    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 1, 3, 4, 9, 16, 27, 36, 80, and 121 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities and equations.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n\n1. \\( A - C = -44 \\) implies \\( A = C - 44 \\).\n2. \\( C > H \\).\n3. \\( I = 3.0D \\).\n4. \\( B - C = -79 \\) implies \\( B = C - 79 \\).\n5. \\( D = 3.0B \\).\n6. \\( A = 4.0I \\).\n7. \\( B - E = -3 \\) implies \\( B = E + 3 \\).\n\nGiven the numbers, we need to find a combination that satisfies all these conditions. Let's start by considering the constraints that involve direct calculations:\n\n- From \\( A = C - 44 \\), we can deduce that \\( C \\) must be one of the larger numbers since \\( A \\) must be positive.\n- From \\( B = C - 79 \\), \\( B \\) must be smaller than \\( C \\).\n- From \\( A = 4.0I \\), \\( A \\) must be a multiple of 4.\n- From \\( I = 3.0D \\), \\( I \\) must be a multiple of 3.\n\nLet's use Python to find the correct assignment of numbers to letters.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Possible values for the letters\nvalues = [1, 3, 4, 9, 16, 27, 36, 80, 121]\n\n# Iterate over all permutations of the values\nfor perm in permutations(values):\n    A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I = perm\n    \n    # Check all conditions\n    if (A == C - 44 and\n        C > H and\n        I == 3 * D and\n        B == C - 79 and\n        D == 3 * B and\n        A == 4 * I and\n        B == E + 3):\n        print([A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I])\n        break\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the solution."
