    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the given numbers to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K such that all the inequalities and equations are satisfied. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the given numbers**: 3, 9, 16, 20, 39, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225.\n\n2. **Analyze the equations and inequalities**:\n   - \\( K = 2.0E \\)\n   - \\( E - C = 72 \\)\n   - \\( J - G = -205 \\)\n   - \\( A + F = 128 \\)\n   - \\( C + F = 51 \\)\n   - \\( G = 1.5K \\)\n   - \\( B + C = 19 \\)\n   - \\( H = 3.0C \\)\n   - \\( F = 2.4J \\)\n   - \\( G + J = 245 \\)\n   - \\( K > H \\)\n\n3. **Solve the equations**:\n   - From \\( E - C = 72 \\), we can express \\( E = C + 72 \\).\n   - From \\( J - G = -205 \\), we can express \\( J = G - 205 \\).\n   - From \\( G + J = 245 \\), we can express \\( J = 245 - G \\).\n   - Equating the two expressions for \\( J \\), we get \\( G - 205 = 245 - G \\), which simplifies to \\( 2G = 450 \\), so \\( G = 225 \\).\n   - Substituting \\( G = 225 \\) into \\( J = 245 - G \\), we get \\( J = 20 \\).\n   - From \\( G = 1.5K \\), we have \\( 225 = 1.5K \\), so \\( K = 150 \\).\n   - From \\( K = 2.0E \\), we have \\( 150 = 2.0E \\), so \\( E = 75 \\).\n   - From \\( E = C + 72 \\), we have \\( 75 = C + 72 \\), so \\( C = 3 \\).\n   - From \\( B + C = 19 \\), we have \\( B + 3 = 19 \\), so \\( B = 16 \\).\n   - From \\( H = 3.0C \\), we have \\( H = 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\).\n   - From \\( C + F = 51 \\), we have \\( 3 + F = 51 \\), so \\( F = 48 \\).\n   - From \\( A + F = 128 \\), we have \\( A + 48 = 128 \\), so \\( A = 80 \\).\n   - From \\( F = 2.4J \\), we have \\( 48 = 2.4 \\times 20 \\), which is consistent.\n\n4. **Check the inequality \\( K > H \\)**:\n   - \\( K = 150 \\) and \\( H = 9 \\), so \\( K > H \\) is satisfied.\n\n5. **Assign the remaining number**:\n   - The only number left is 39, which must be assigned to D.\n\nNow, let's list the values in alphabetical order:\n\n- A = 80\n- B = 16\n- C = 3\n- D = 39\n- E = 75\n- F = 48\n- G = 225\n- H = 9\n- I = 121\n- J = 20\n- K = 150\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[80, 16, 3, 39, 75, 48, 225, 9, 121, 20, 150]>>>"
