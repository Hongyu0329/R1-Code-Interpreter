    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, 96 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M such that all the given inequalities are satisfied.\n\nLet's analyze the inequalities:\n\n1. \\( E - D = 25 \\)\n2. \\( H + I = 103 \\)\n3. \\( E = 2.8M \\)\n4. \\( C + I = 120 \\)\n5. \\( A + I = 101 \\)\n6. \\( I - J = 51 \\)\n7. \\( I + J = 141 \\)\n8. \\( H - I = -89 \\)\n9. \\( E = 4.0H \\)\n10. \\( G = 3.0A \\)\n11. \\( G - E = -13 \\)\n\nFrom inequalities 6 and 7, we can solve for I and J:\n- \\( I - J = 51 \\)\n- \\( I + J = 141 \\)\n\nAdding these two equations, we get:\n- \\( 2I = 192 \\)\n- \\( I = 96 \\)\n\nSubstituting \\( I = 96 \\) into \\( I + J = 141 \\):\n- \\( 96 + J = 141 \\)\n- \\( J = 45 \\)\n\nNow, substituting \\( I = 96 \\) into inequality 2:\n- \\( H + 96 = 103 \\)\n- \\( H = 7 \\)\n\nSubstituting \\( I = 96 \\) into inequality 5:\n- \\( A + 96 = 101 \\)\n- \\( A = 5 \\)\n\nSubstituting \\( H = 7 \\) into inequality 9:\n- \\( E = 4.0 \\times 7 = 28 \\)\n\nSubstituting \\( E = 28 \\) into inequality 1:\n- \\( 28 - D = 25 \\)\n- \\( D = 3 \\)\n\nSubstituting \\( E = 28 \\) into inequality 11:\n- \\( G - 28 = -13 \\)\n- \\( G = 15 \\)\n\nSubstituting \\( G = 15 \\) and \\( A = 5 \\) into inequality 10:\n- \\( 15 = 3.0 \\times 5 \\) (This is consistent)\n\nSubstituting \\( E = 28 \\) into inequality 3:\n- \\( 28 = 2.8M \\)\n- \\( M = 10 \\)\n\nSubstituting \\( I = 96 \\) into inequality 4:\n- \\( C + 96 = 120 \\)\n- \\( C = 24 \\)\n\nNow, we have the following assignments:\n- A = 5\n- B = ?\n- C = 24\n- D = 3\n- E = 28\n- F = ?\n- G = 15\n- H = 7\n- I = 96\n- J = 45\n- K = ?\n- L = ?\n- M = 10\n\nThe remaining numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, 96. The numbers 2, 16, 36, 50 are left for B, F, K, L.\n\nLet's assign these numbers to the remaining letters:\n- B = 2\n- F = 16\n- K = 36\n- L = 50\n\nNow, let's list the values in alphabetical order:\n\n```python\n# Assigning the values to the letters\nA = 5\nB = 2\nC = 24\nD = 3\nE = 28\nF = 16\nG = 15\nH = 7\nI = 96\nJ = 45\nK = 36\nL = 50\nM = 10\n\n# Creating the list in alphabetical order\nresult = [A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M]\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to get the final answer.",
    "The code execution result seems to be correct based on the reasoning process. However, let's verify the solution by checking if all the inequalities are satisfied with the assigned values:\n\n1. \\( E - D = 28 - 3 = 25 \\) (satisfied)\n2. \\( H + I = 7 + 96 = 103 \\) (satisfied)\n3. \\( E = 2.8M = 2.8 \\times 10 = 28 \\) (satisfied)\n4. \\( C + I = 24 + 96 = 120 \\) (satisfied)\n5. \\( A + I = 5 + 96 = 101 \\) (satisfied)\n6. \\( I - J = 96 - 45 = 51 \\) (satisfied)\n7. \\( I + J = 96 + 45 = 141 \\) (satisfied)\n8. \\( H - I = 7 - 96 = -89 \\) (satisfied)\n9. \\( E = 4.0H = 4.0 \\times 7 = 28 \\) (satisfied)\n10. \\( G = 3.0A = 3.0 \\times 5 = 15 \\) (satisfied)\n11. \\( G - E = 15 - 28 = -13 \\) (satisfied)\n\nAll inequalities are satisfied with the assigned values. Therefore, the solution is correct.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<[5, 2, 24, 3, 28, 16, 15, 7, 96, 45, 36, 50, 10]>>>"
