    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, 96 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M such that all the given inequalities and equations are satisfied.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n\n1. B + I = 31\n2. I = 1.5D\n3. K - E = -2\n4. B + H = 57\n5. C + F = 132\n6. K - D = -13\n7. M = 2.0E\n8. A + G = 43\n9. M > B\n10. D - H = -34\n11. F = 4.0I\n12. I + L = 69\n\nWe will use these constraints to deduce the values of each letter. Let's start by solving the equations that involve fewer variables or have direct relationships.\n\n- From equation 2, I = 1.5D, we know I must be a multiple of 1.5. The possible values for I are 24, 36, and 96, which correspond to D being 16, 24, and 64, respectively. However, 64 is not in our list, so D must be 16, and I must be 24.\n\n- From equation 11, F = 4.0I, we have F = 4 * 24 = 96.\n\n- From equation 1, B + I = 31, we have B = 31 - 24 = 7.\n\n- From equation 4, B + H = 57, we have H = 57 - 7 = 50.\n\n- From equation 10, D - H = -34, we have 16 - H = -34, so H = 50, which is consistent.\n\n- From equation 3, K - E = -2, we have K = E - 2.\n\n- From equation 6, K - D = -13, we have K = 16 - 13 = 3.\n\n- From equation 3, K = E - 2, we have E = 3 + 2 = 5.\n\n- From equation 7, M = 2.0E, we have M = 2 * 5 = 10.\n\n- From equation 9, M > B, we have 10 > 7, which is consistent.\n\n- From equation 12, I + L = 69, we have L = 69 - 24 = 45.\n\n- From equation 5, C + F = 132, we have C = 132 - 96 = 36.\n\n- From equation 8, A + G = 43, we have A + G = 43.\n\nNow, we have the following assignments:\n- A and G are left, and they must sum to 43. The remaining numbers are 2, 15, and 28. The only combination that sums to 43 is 15 and 28.\n\nLet's assign:\n- A = 15\n- G = 28\n\nNow, let's verify the assignments:\n- A = 15\n- B = 7\n- C = 36\n- D = 16\n- E = 5\n- F = 96\n- G = 28\n- H = 50\n- I = 24\n- J = 2\n- K = 3\n- L = 45\n- M = 10\n\nAll constraints are satisfied with these assignments. Let's return the final answer in alphabetical order.\n\n```python\n# Assigning the values to the letters\nA = 15\nB = 7\nC = 36\nD = 16\nE = 5\nF = 96\nG = 28\nH = 50\nI = 24\nJ = 2\nK = 3\nL = 45\nM = 10\n\n# Creating the list in alphabetical order\nresult = [A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M]\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to verify the result.",
