    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the given numbers to the letters A through M such that all the inequalities and equations are satisfied. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the equations and inequalities:**\n   - I = 2.4F\n   - D = 4.8C\n   - D = 1.6F\n   - B = 1.6L\n   - M = 3.5E\n   - G - J = -17\n   - H - B = 34\n   - B = 3.2C\n   - H > E\n   - H + L = 60\n   - I - C = 31\n   - H > A\n\n2. **List of numbers to assign:** 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, 96.\n\n3. **Solve the equations:**\n   - From D = 1.6F and D = 4.8C, we can deduce that F = 3C.\n   - From I = 2.4F, we can deduce that I = 7.2C.\n   - From B = 3.2C, we can deduce that B = 3.2C.\n   - From M = 3.5E, we can deduce that M = 3.5E.\n   - From I - C = 31, we can deduce that 7.2C - C = 31, so 6.2C = 31, thus C = 5.\n   - Substitute C = 5 into the equations:\n     - F = 3C = 15\n     - I = 7.2C = 36\n     - B = 3.2C = 16\n     - D = 4.8C = 24\n\n4. **Use the inequalities and remaining equations:**\n   - G - J = -17\n   - H - B = 34, so H = 34 + B = 50\n   - H + L = 60, so L = 60 - H = 10\n   - M = 3.5E, and M must be one of the remaining numbers. Since M = 3.5E, E must be 10, and M = 35, but 35 is not in the list. So, let's try E = 28, then M = 3.5 * 28 = 98, which is not in the list. Try E = 16, then M = 3.5 * 16 = 56, which is not in the list. Try E = 24, then M = 3.5 * 24 = 84, which is not in the list. Try E = 2, then M = 3.5 * 2 = 7, which is in the list.\n   - H > E, and H = 50, E = 2, so this is satisfied.\n   - H > A, so A must be less than 50.\n\n5. **Assign remaining numbers:**\n   - A = 3 (since it must be less than 50 and is one of the remaining numbers)\n   - G = 28 (since G - J = -17, and J = 45, G = 28)\n   - J = 45\n\nNow, let's verify the assignments:\n- A = 3\n- B = 16\n- C = 5\n- D = 24\n- E = 2\n- F = 15\n- G = 28\n- H = 50\n- I = 36\n- J = 45\n- K = 96 (remaining number)\n- L = 10\n- M = 7\n\nAll conditions are satisfied with these assignments. Let's return the final answer in alphabetical order.\n\n<<<[3, 16, 5, 24, 2, 15, 28, 50, 36, 45, 96, 10, 7]>>>"
