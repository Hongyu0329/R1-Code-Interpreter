    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 3, 6, 9, 20, 32, 36, 80, 120, and 121 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities.\n\nLet's analyze the inequalities:\n\n1. \\( D = 1.5I \\)\n2. \\( I = 2.5H \\)\n3. \\( C + H = 52 \\)\n4. \\( I = 4.0C \\)\n5. \\( C - H = -12 \\)\n6. \\( D + I = 200 \\)\n7. \\( B - H = -23 \\)\n8. \\( H = 1.6C \\)\n\nFrom inequalities 3 and 5, we can solve for \\( C \\) and \\( H \\):\n- \\( C + H = 52 \\)\n- \\( C - H = -12 \\)\n\nAdding these two equations:\n\\[ 2C = 40 \\]\n\\[ C = 20 \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( C = 20 \\) into \\( C + H = 52 \\):\n\\[ 20 + H = 52 \\]\n\\[ H = 32 \\]\n\nNow, using inequality 8:\n\\[ H = 1.6C \\]\n\\[ 32 = 1.6 \\times 20 \\]\nThis is consistent.\n\nUsing inequality 4:\n\\[ I = 4.0C \\]\n\\[ I = 4 \\times 20 = 80 \\]\n\nUsing inequality 2:\n\\[ I = 2.5H \\]\n\\[ 80 = 2.5 \\times 32 \\]\nThis is consistent.\n\nUsing inequality 1:\n\\[ D = 1.5I \\]\n\\[ D = 1.5 \\times 80 = 120 \\]\n\nUsing inequality 6:\n\\[ D + I = 200 \\]\n\\[ 120 + 80 = 200 \\]\nThis is consistent.\n\nUsing inequality 7:\n\\[ B - H = -23 \\]\n\\[ B - 32 = -23 \\]\n\\[ B = 9 \\]\n\nNow, we have:\n- \\( A \\) is not yet assigned.\n- \\( E \\) is not yet assigned.\n- \\( F \\) is not yet assigned.\n- \\( G \\) is not yet assigned.\n\nThe remaining numbers are 3, 6, 36, and 121. We need to assign these to A, E, F, and G.\n\nSince the inequalities do not provide further constraints on A, E, F, and G, we can assign the remaining numbers in any order. Let's assign them in increasing order of the letters:\n\n- \\( A = 3 \\)\n- \\( E = 6 \\)\n- \\( F = 36 \\)\n- \\( G = 121 \\)\n\nNow, let's list the values in alphabetical order:\n\n- A = 3\n- B = 9\n- C = 20\n- D = 120\n- E = 6\n- F = 36\n- G = 121\n- H = 32\n- I = 80\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[3, 9, 20, 120, 6, 36, 121, 32, 80]>>>"
