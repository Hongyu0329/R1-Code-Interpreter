    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 1, 3, 4, 9, 16, 27, 36, 80, and 121 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities.\n\nLet's analyze the inequalities:\n\n1. \\( D = 3.0B \\)\n2. \\( A + F = 52 \\)\n3. \\( D - H = -71 \\)\n4. \\( B + I = 30 \\)\n5. \\( D + E = 13 \\)\n6. \\( I = 3.0D \\)\n7. \\( F = 4.0E \\)\n\nFrom inequality 6, \\( I = 3.0D \\), we can deduce that I must be three times D. The possible pairs (D, I) from the given numbers are (9, 27) because 27 is three times 9.\n\nFrom inequality 1, \\( D = 3.0B \\), we can deduce that B must be one-third of D. The possible pair (B, D) is (3, 9) because 9 is three times 3.\n\nFrom inequality 4, \\( B + I = 30 \\), we can check if B = 3 and I = 27 satisfy this condition: \\( 3 + 27 = 30 \\), which is true.\n\nFrom inequality 3, \\( D - H = -71 \\), we can deduce that H must be 71 more than D. Since D = 9, H = 80.\n\nFrom inequality 5, \\( D + E = 13 \\), we can deduce that E must be 13 - D. Since D = 9, E = 4.\n\nFrom inequality 7, \\( F = 4.0E \\), we can deduce that F must be four times E. Since E = 4, F = 16.\n\nFrom inequality 2, \\( A + F = 52 \\), we can deduce that A must be 52 - F. Since F = 16, A = 36.\n\nNow, we have the following assignments:\n- A = 36\n- B = 3\n- D = 9\n- E = 4\n- F = 16\n- H = 80\n- I = 27\n\nThe remaining numbers are 1 and 121, which must be assigned to C and G. Since there are no constraints on C and G, we can assign them as follows:\n- C = 1\n- G = 121\n\nNow, let's verify the assignments:\n- \\( D = 3.0B \\) is satisfied: \\( 9 = 3 \\times 3 \\)\n- \\( A + F = 52 \\) is satisfied: \\( 36 + 16 = 52 \\)\n- \\( D - H = -71 \\) is satisfied: \\( 9 - 80 = -71 \\)\n- \\( B + I = 30 \\) is satisfied: \\( 3 + 27 = 30 \\)\n- \\( D + E = 13 \\) is satisfied: \\( 9 + 4 = 13 \\)\n- \\( I = 3.0D \\) is satisfied: \\( 27 = 3 \\times 9 \\)\n- \\( F = 4.0E \\) is satisfied: \\( 16 = 4 \\times 4 \\)\n\nAll constraints are satisfied, so the final answer is:\n\n<<<[36, 3, 1, 9, 4, 16, 121, 80, 27]>>>"
