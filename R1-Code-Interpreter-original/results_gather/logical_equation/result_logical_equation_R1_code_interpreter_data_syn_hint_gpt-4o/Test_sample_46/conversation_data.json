    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the given numbers to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K such that all the inequalities and equations are satisfied. The numbers available are 3, 9, 16, 20, 39, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, and 225.\n\nLet's analyze the given equations and inequalities:\n\n1. A + F = 196\n2. G - D = -6\n3. G - A = -72\n4. E = 3.0A\n5. B > I\n6. K - A = 75\n7. H - F = -41\n8. B - G = 36\n9. A - H = -5\n10. E - A = 150\n11. H - J = 64\n\nFrom these equations, we can derive some relationships:\n\n- From equation 3, G = A - 72.\n- From equation 6, K = A + 75.\n- From equation 10, E = A + 150.\n- From equation 9, H = A + 5.\n- From equation 11, J = H - 64 = A + 5 - 64 = A - 59.\n\nNow, let's use these relationships to find the values of A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K. We will use a systematic approach to assign values to these variables and check if they satisfy all the conditions.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Possible values for the letters\nvalues = [3, 9, 16, 20, 39, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225]\n\n# Iterate over all permutations of the values\nfor perm in permutations(values):\n    A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K = perm\n    \n    # Check all conditions\n    if (A + F == 196 and\n        G - D == -6 and\n        G - A == -72 and\n        E == 3.0 * A and\n        B > I and\n        K - A == 75 and\n        H - F == -41 and\n        B - G == 36 and\n        A - H == -5 and\n        E - A == 150 and\n        H - J == 64):\n        print([A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K])\n        break\n```\n\nThis code will iterate over all permutations of the given numbers and check if they satisfy all the given conditions. Once a valid permutation is found, it will print the values corresponding to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K.",
    "The code execution result indicates that the permutation found satisfies all the given conditions. Let's verify the solution by checking each condition with the values obtained:\n\n- A = 75\n- B = 39\n- C = 48\n- D = 9\n- E = 225\n- F = 121\n- G = 3\n- H = 80\n- I = 20\n- J = 16\n- K = 150\n\nNow, let's verify each condition:\n\n1. A + F = 196: 75 + 121 = 196 ✔️\n2. G - D = -6: 3 - 9 = -6 ✔️\n3. G - A = -72: 3 - 75 = -72 ✔️\n4. E = 3.0A: 225 = 3 * 75 ✔️\n5. B > I: 39 > 20 ✔️\n6. K - A = 75: 150 - 75 = 75 ✔️\n7. H - F = -41: 80 - 121 = -41 ✔️\n8. B - G = 36: 39 - 3 = 36 ✔️\n9. A - H = -5: 75 - 80 = -5 ✔️\n10. E - A = 150: 225 - 75 = 150 ✔️\n11. H - J = 64: 80 - 16 = 64 ✔️\n\nAll conditions are satisfied with the given values. Therefore, the solution is correct.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<[75, 39, 48, 9, 225, 121, 3, 80, 20, 16, 150]>>>"
