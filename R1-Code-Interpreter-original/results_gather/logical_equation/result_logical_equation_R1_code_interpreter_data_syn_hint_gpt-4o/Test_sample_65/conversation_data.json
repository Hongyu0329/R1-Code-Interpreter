There are 13 letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, each representing one of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50. The system of inequalities is satisfied as follows:\n1.

C + E = 21\n\nReturn the answers in alphabetical order starting with A, and each element in the list represents the value of the corresponding letter.

    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M such that all the given inequalities and equations are satisfied.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n\n1. F = 2.0E: F is twice E.\n2. B > E: B is greater than E.\n3. A - H = 5: A is 5 more than H.\n4. D + L = 48: The sum of D and L is 48.\n5. B > J: B is greater than J.\n6. B + J = 16: The sum of B and J is 16.\n7. A + B = 22: The sum of A and B is 22.\n8. A = 1.4E: A is 1.4 times E.\n9. G + J = 25: The sum of G and J is 25.\n10.

This means F and E must be such that F is an even number and E is half of F.\n2. **A = 1.4E**: A is 1.4 times E. This means A must be 1.4 times E, which implies E must be a number that when multiplied by 1.4 results in an integer.\n3. **B + J = 16** and **B > J**: This gives us a limited set of pairs for B and J.\n4. **G + J = 25**: This gives us a limited set of pairs for G and J.\n5. **A + B = 22**: This gives us a limited set of pairs for A and B.\n6. **C + E = 21**: This gives us a limited set of pairs for C and E.\n7. **D + L = 48**: This gives us a limited set of pairs for D and L.\n8. **A - H = 5**: This gives us a limited set of pairs for A and H.\n\nGiven these constraints, we can start by solving the equations that involve fewer variables and use them to deduce the others.
