    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 1, 3, 4, 9, 16, 27, 36, 80, and 121 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I, respectively, while satisfying the given inequalities and equations.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n\n1. \\( B > F \\)\n2. \\( D + E = 107 \\)\n3. \\( D > F \\)\n4. \\( D - F = 77 \\)\n5. \\( C > B \\)\n6. \\( C + I = 52 \\)\n7. \\( B = 3.0F \\)\n\nFrom constraints 4 and 7, we can deduce:\n- \\( D = F + 77 \\)\n- \\( B = 3F \\)\n\nSubstituting \\( D = F + 77 \\) into constraint 2:\n- \\( (F + 77) + E = 107 \\)\n- \\( E = 107 - F - 77 = 30 - F \\)\n\nNow, let's use the available numbers to find a consistent assignment:\n\n- The numbers are: 1, 3, 4, 9, 16, 27, 36, 80, 121.\n\nLet's try to find a suitable value for F that satisfies all conditions:\n\n1. \\( B = 3F \\) and \\( B > F \\) implies \\( F < 3F \\), which is always true for positive F.\n2. \\( D = F + 77 \\) and \\( D > F \\) implies \\( F + 77 > F \\), which is always true.\n3. \\( E = 30 - F \\) must be one of the available numbers.\n4. \\( C + I = 52 \\) must be satisfied with the remaining numbers.\n\nLet's try to find a suitable F:\n\n- If \\( F = 9 \\), then \\( B = 27 \\), \\( D = 86 \\), \\( E = 21 \\) (not available).\n- If \\( F = 4 \\), then \\( B = 12 \\) (not available).\n- If \\( F = 3 \\), then \\( B = 9 \\), \\( D = 80 \\), \\( E = 27 \\).\n\nNow, let's check if the remaining numbers can satisfy the other conditions:\n\n- Remaining numbers: 1, 4, 16, 36, 121.\n- \\( C > B \\) implies \\( C > 9 \\).\n- \\( C + I = 52 \\).\n\nLet's try \\( C = 36 \\), then \\( I = 52 - 36 = 16 \\).\n\nNow, let's assign the remaining numbers to A, G, and H:\n\n- Remaining numbers: 1, 4, 121.\n- Assign \\( A = 1 \\), \\( G = 4 \\), \\( H = 121 \\).\n\nLet's verify:\n\n- \\( B = 9 > F = 3 \\) (True)\n- \\( D = 80 + E = 27 = 107 \\) (True)\n- \\( D = 80 > F = 3 \\) (True)\n- \\( D - F = 80 - 3 = 77 \\) (True)\n- \\( C = 36 > B = 9 \\) (True)\n- \\( C + I = 36 + 16 = 52 \\) (True)\n- \\( B = 3 \\times F = 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\) (True)\n\nAll conditions are satisfied. Therefore, the assignment is correct.\n\nThe final values for each letter in alphabetical order are:\n\n- A = 1\n- B = 9\n- C = 36\n- D = 80\n- E = 27\n- F = 3\n- G = 4\n- H = 121\n- I = 16\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<[1, 9, 36, 80, 27, 3, 4, 121, 16]>>>"
