    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 1, 3, 4, 9, 16, 27, 36, 80, and 121 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities.\n\nLet's analyze the inequalities:\n\n1. \\( C - E = -5 \\) implies \\( C = E - 5 \\).\n2. \\( D - F = 79 \\) implies \\( D = F + 79 \\).\n3. \\( G = 4.0E \\) implies \\( G = 4E \\).\n4. \\( H = 4.0C \\) implies \\( H = 4C \\).\n5. \\( E - G = -27 \\) implies \\( E = G - 27 \\).\n6. \\( E + H = 25 \\).\n7. \\( A + H = 137 \\).\n\nFrom these equations, we can derive some relationships:\n\n- From equations 3 and 5: \\( G = 4E \\) and \\( E = G - 27 \\). Substituting the second into the first gives \\( G = 4(G - 27) \\). Solving for \\( G \\) gives \\( G = 36 \\) and \\( E = 9 \\).\n- From equation 1: \\( C = E - 5 = 9 - 5 = 4 \\).\n- From equation 4: \\( H = 4C = 4 \\times 4 = 16 \\).\n- From equation 6: \\( E + H = 25 \\) confirms \\( 9 + 16 = 25 \\).\n- From equation 7: \\( A + H = 137 \\) gives \\( A = 137 - 16 = 121 \\).\n- From equation 2: \\( D = F + 79 \\). Since \\( D \\) and \\( F \\) are the remaining numbers, \\( D = 80 \\) and \\( F = 1 \\).\n- The remaining numbers are 3 and 27, which must be assigned to B and I. Since B is not involved in any equation, we can assign \\( B = 3 \\) and \\( I = 27 \\).\n\nNow, let's verify and compute the assignments using Python to ensure correctness:\n\n```python\n# Assign the numbers to the letters based on the derived relationships\nA = 121\nB = 3\nC = 4\nD = 80\nE = 9\nF = 1\nG = 36\nH = 16\nI = 27\n\n# Verify the inequalities\nassert C - E == -5\nassert D - F == 79\nassert G == 4 * E\nassert H == 4 * C\nassert E - G == -27\nassert E + H == 25\nassert A + H == 137\n\n# Output the results in alphabetical order\nresult = [A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I]\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to confirm the solution.",
    "The code execution result matches our expectations, and the assignments satisfy all the given inequalities. Let's summarize the solution:\n\n- A = 121\n- B = 3\n- C = 4\n- D = 80\n- E = 9\n- F = 1\n- G = 36\n- H = 16\n- I = 27\n\nThese values satisfy all the given inequalities, and the numbers are correctly assigned to the letters.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[121, 3, 4, 80, 9, 1, 36, 16, 27]>>>"
