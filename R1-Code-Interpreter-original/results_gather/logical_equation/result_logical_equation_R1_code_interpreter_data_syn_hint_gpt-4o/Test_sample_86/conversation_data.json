    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the given numbers to the letters A through M such that all the inequalities are satisfied. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **List of numbers**: 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, 96.\n\n2. **Equations and inequalities**:\n   - C + H = 52\n   - G + I = 13\n   - H = 2.4E\n   - F + J = 57\n   - A - I = 25\n   - J - I = 4\n   - D + G = 34\n   - F + L = 95\n   - A = 4.0J\n   - F + G = 60\n   - J = 1.4K\n\n3. **Approach**:\n   - Start by solving equations that have direct relationships.\n   - Use the constraints to narrow down possibilities for each letter.\n   - Check the consistency of the assignments with all equations.\n\nLet's start by solving the equations that have direct relationships and use Python to help us find the solution.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# List of numbers to assign\nnumbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, 96]\n\n# Iterate over all permutations of the numbers\nfor perm in permutations(numbers):\n    A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M = perm\n    \n    # Check all the conditions\n    if (C + H == 52 and\n        G + I == 13 and\n        H == 2.4 * E and\n        F + J == 57 and\n        A - I == 25 and\n        J - I == 4 and\n        D + G == 34 and\n        F + L == 95 and\n        A == 4.0 * J and\n        F + G == 60 and\n        J == 1.4 * K):\n        \n        # If all conditions are satisfied, print the result\n        print([A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M])\n        break\n```\n\nThis code will iterate over all permutations of the numbers and check if they satisfy all the given conditions. Once a valid assignment is found, it will print the result. Let's execute this code to find the solution.",
    "The previous approach using permutations is computationally expensive due to the factorial growth of possibilities. Instead, let's use a more targeted approach by solving the equations step by step, leveraging the relationships between the variables to reduce the search space.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Direct Relationships**:\n   - From `A = 4.0J`, we know A must be four times J.\n   - From `J = 1.4K`, we know J must be 1.4 times K.\n   - From `H = 2.4E`, we know H must be 2.4 times E.\n\n2. **Derived Relationships**:\n   - From `A - I = 25`, we can express I in terms of A: `I = A - 25`.\n   - From `J - I = 4`, we can express I in terms of J: `I = J - 4`.\n\n3. **Substitution**:\n   - Substitute `I = J - 4` into `A - I = 25` to find a relationship between A and J.\n   - Use `F + J = 57` and `F + G = 60` to find a relationship between J and G.\n\n4. **Iterative Search**:\n   - Use the derived relationships to iteratively search for valid assignments, reducing the number of permutations needed.\n\nLet's implement this refined approach in Python:\n\n```python\n# List of numbers to assign\nnumbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, 96]\n\n# Iterate over possible values for J and K based on their relationship\nfor J in numbers:\n    for K in numbers:\n        if J == 1.4 * K:\n            A = 4.0 * J\n            if A in numbers:\n                I = J - 4\n                if I in numbers:\n                    F = 57 - J\n                    if F in numbers:\n                        G = 60 - F\n                        if G in numbers:\n                            D = 34 - G\n                            if D in numbers:\n                                E = (J - 4) / 2.4\n                                if E in numbers:\n                                    H = 2.4 * E\n                                    if H in numbers:\n                                        C = 52 - H\n                                        if C in numbers:\n                                            L = 95 - F\n                                            if L in numbers:\n                                                B = next(x for x in numbers if x not in [A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M])\n                                                M = next(x for x in numbers if x not in [A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, B])\n                                                print([A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M])\n                                                break\n```\n\nThis code uses a more targeted search by leveraging the relationships between the variables, significantly reducing the number of permutations needed.
