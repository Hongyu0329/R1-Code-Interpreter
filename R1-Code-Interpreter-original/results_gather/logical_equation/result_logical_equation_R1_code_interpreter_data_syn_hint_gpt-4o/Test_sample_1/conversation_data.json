    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 1, 3, 4, 9, 16, 27, 36, 80, and 121 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I, respectively, while satisfying the given inequalities and equations.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n\n1. \\( C = 3.0B \\)\n2. \\( A = 4.0C \\)\n3. \\( F > A \\)\n4. \\( D = 4.0H \\)\n5. \\( E > B \\)\n6. \\( A - H = 32 \\)\n7. \\( F + H = 84 \\)\n\nWe will use these constraints to determine the values of each letter.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **From \\( C = 3.0B \\):**  \n   - Possible pairs (B, C) from the given numbers are (3, 9).\n\n2. **From \\( A = 4.0C \\):**  \n   - If \\( C = 9 \\), then \\( A = 36 \\).\n\n3. **From \\( A - H = 32 \\):**  \n   - If \\( A = 36 \\), then \\( H = 4 \\).\n\n4. **From \\( D = 4.0H \\):**  \n   - If \\( H = 4 \\), then \\( D = 16 \\).\n\n5. **From \\( F + H = 84 \\):**  \n   - If \\( H = 4 \\), then \\( F = 80 \\).\n\n6. **From \\( F > A \\):**  \n   - \\( F = 80 \\) and \\( A = 36 \\), so this condition is satisfied.\n\n7. **From \\( E > B \\):**  \n   - If \\( B = 3 \\), then possible values for \\( E \\) are 9, 16, 27, 36, 80, 121. Since 9, 16, 36, and 80 are already used, \\( E = 27 \\).\n\nNow, we have assigned values to A, B, C, D, E, F, and H. The remaining numbers are 1 and 121, which must be assigned to G and I. Since there are no constraints on G and I, we can assign them as follows:\n\n- \\( G = 1 \\)\n- \\( I = 121 \\)\n\nLet's verify the assignments:\n\n- A = 36\n- B = 3\n- C = 9\n- D = 16\n- E = 27\n- F = 80\n- G = 1\n- H = 4\n- I = 121\n\nAll constraints are satisfied with these assignments. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[36, 3, 9, 16, 27, 80, 1, 4, 121]>>>"
