    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the given numbers to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K such that all the given inequalities and equations are satisfied. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **List of numbers**: 3, 9, 16, 27, 36, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225\n2. **Equations and inequalities**:\n   - F - C = -141\n   - C > D\n   - E + K = 305\n   - K = 3.0A\n   - H = 3.0F\n   - I + J = 157\n   - K = 1.5C\n   - K - A = 150\n   - F + G = 25\n   - B + C = 153\n\nLet's start by solving these equations step by step:\n\n- From equation 4, K = 3.0A, and from equation 8, K - A = 150, we can deduce:\n  - K = 3A\n  - K = A + 150\n  - Therefore, 3A = A + 150\n  - Solving for A gives A = 75\n\n- With A = 75, K = 3A = 225\n\n- From equation 3, E + K = 305, we have E + 225 = 305, so E = 80\n\n- From equation 7, K = 1.5C, we have 225 = 1.5C, so C = 150\n\n- From equation 1, F - C = -141, we have F - 150 = -141, so F = 9\n\n- From equation 5, H = 3.0F, we have H = 3 * 9 = 27\n\n- From equation 9, F + G = 25, we have 9 + G = 25, so G = 16\n\n- From equation 10, B + C = 153, we have B + 150 = 153, so B = 3\n\n- From equation 6, I + J = 157, and the remaining numbers are 36 and 121, so I = 36 and J = 121\n\n- Finally, C > D, and the only remaining number is 48, so D = 48\n\nNow, let's verify the solution by checking if all conditions are satisfied with these assignments:\n\n- A = 75, B = 3, C = 150, D = 48, E = 80, F = 9, G = 16, H = 27, I = 36, J = 121, K = 225\n\nAll conditions are satisfied with these values. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[75, 3, 150, 48, 80, 9, 16, 27, 36, 121, 225]>>>"
