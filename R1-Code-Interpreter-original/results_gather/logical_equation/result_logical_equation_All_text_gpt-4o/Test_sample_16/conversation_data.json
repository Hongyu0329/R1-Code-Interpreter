    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 3, 6, 9, 20, 32, 36, 80, 120, and 121 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities. Let's analyze each inequality step by step:\n\n1. **C = 3.0D**: This implies that C is three times D. The possible pairs (C, D) from the given numbers that satisfy this are (9, 3).\n\n2. **C = 1.5F**: This implies that C is 1.5 times F. The possible pairs (C, F) from the given numbers that satisfy this are (9, 6).\n\n3. **D - C = -6**: This implies that D is 6 less than C. The pair (C, D) = (9, 3) satisfies this condition.\n\n4. **F = 2.0D**: This implies that F is twice D. The pair (F, D) = (6, 3) satisfies this condition.\n\n5. **D + E = 124**: With D = 3, E must be 121 to satisfy this equation.\n\n6. **A + H = 112**: We need to find numbers for A and H that sum to 112. The possible pair from the given numbers is (32, 80).\n\n7. **I = 1.5A**: This implies that I is 1.5 times A. The pair (I, A) = (48, 32) satisfies this condition. However, 48 is not in the list of numbers, so we need to check again. The correct pair should be (I, A) = (120, 80) because 120 is 1.5 times 80.\n\n8. **D + G = 23**: With D = 3, G must be 20 to satisfy this equation.\n\nNow, let's assign the numbers to the letters based on the above analysis:\n\n- A = 80\n- B = 36 (since B is not involved in any equation, it takes the remaining number)\n- C = 9\n- D = 3\n- E = 121\n- F = 6\n- G = 20\n- H = 32\n- I = 120\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[80, 36, 9, 3, 121, 6, 20, 32, 120]>>>"
