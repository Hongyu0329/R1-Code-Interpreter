    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 3, 9, 16, 20, 39, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, and 225 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities. Let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **B + F = 346**: This implies B and F must be two numbers that add up to 346. The possible pairs from the given numbers are (121, 225) and (225, 121).\n\n2. **A + E = 155**: A and E must add up to 155. The possible pairs are (75, 80) and (80, 75).\n\n3. **F + G = 228**: F and G must add up to 228. The possible pairs are (80, 148) and (148, 80), but since 148 is not in the list, the only valid pair is (80, 148).\n\n4. **A + H = 128**: A and H must add up to 128. The possible pairs are (48, 80) and (80, 48), but since 80 is already used, the valid pair is (48, 80).\n\n5. **A = 4.0D**: A must be four times D. The only valid pair is (48, 12), but since 12 is not in the list, we need to check other constraints.\n\n6. **I - K = -23**: I and K must differ by 23, with K being larger. The possible pairs are (121, 144) and (144, 121), but since 144 is not in the list, the valid pair is (121, 144).\n\n7. **J = 2.0E**: J must be twice E. The only valid pair is (150, 75).\n\n8. **F = 3.0E**: F must be three times E. The only valid pair is (225, 75).\n\n9. **B - J = -29**: B must be 29 less than J. The valid pair is (121, 150).\n\n10. **A + K = 119**: A and K must add up to 119. The possible pairs are (48, 71) and (71, 48), but since 71 is not in the list, we need to check other constraints.\n\n11. **H = 3.0I**: H must be three times I. The only valid pair is (75, 25), but since 25 is not in the list, we need to check other constraints.\n\nNow, let's assign the numbers based on the constraints:\n\n- From constraint 8, F = 225 and E = 75.\n- From constraint 7, J = 150.\n- From constraint 9, B = 121.\n- From constraint 1, B + F = 346, so B = 121 and F = 225.\n- From constraint 2, A + E = 155, so A = 80.\n- From constraint 4, A + H = 128, so H = 48.\n- From constraint 5, A = 4.0D, so D = 20.\n- From constraint 6, I - K = -23, so I = 39 and K = 62.\n- From constraint 10, A + K = 119, so K = 39.\n- From constraint 11, H = 3.0I, so I = 16.\n\nFinally, the assignments are:\n- A = 80\n- B = 121\n- C = 3\n- D = 20\n- E = 75\n- F = 225\n- G = 3\n- H = 48\n- I = 16\n- J = 150\n- K = 39\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<[80, 121, 3, 20, 75, 225, 3, 48, 16, 150, 39]>>>"
