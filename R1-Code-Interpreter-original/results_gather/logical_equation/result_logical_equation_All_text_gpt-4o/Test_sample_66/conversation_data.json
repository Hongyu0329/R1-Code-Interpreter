    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, and 50 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and M, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities. Let's analyze each inequality step by step:\n\n1. **D = 3.0I**: This implies that D is three times the value of I. The possible pairs (D, I) from the given numbers are (15, 5).\n\n2. **C + H = 20**: We need to find two numbers from the list that add up to 20. The possible pair is (5, 15).\n\n3. **A > F**: A must be greater than F. We will use this inequality later when we have more information.\n\n4. **F + G = 38**: We need to find two numbers that add up to 38. The possible pair is (10, 28).\n\n5. **L - G = -26**: This implies L = G - 26. From the pair (10, 28) for F and G, we have G = 28, so L = 28 - 26 = 2. However, 2 is not in the list, so let's try another pair. If G = 36, then L = 36 - 26 = 10, which is valid.\n\n6. **C + F = 17**: We need to find two numbers that add up to 17. The possible pair is (7, 10).\n\n7. **E + L = 60**: We need to find two numbers that add up to 60. With L = 10, E = 50.\n\n8. **M = 4.5L**: With L = 10, M = 4.5 * 10 = 45.\n\n9. **A - K = -17**: This implies A = K + 17. We will use this inequality later when we have more information.\n\n10. **D + H = 8**: With D = 15, H = 8 - 15 = -7, which is not possible. Let's re-evaluate the possible values for D and H. If D = 3 and H = 5, then D + H = 8, which is valid.\n\nNow, let's assign the numbers to the letters based on the above analysis:\n\n- **D = 3** and **I = 1** (since D = 3.0I)\n- **C = 7** and **H = 13** (since C + H = 20)\n- **F = 10** and **G = 28** (since F + G = 38)\n- **L = 10** and **E = 50** (since E + L = 60)\n- **M = 45** (since M = 4.5L)\n- **A = 36** and **K = 19** (since A - K = -17)\n\nFinally, let's list the values in alphabetical order:\n\n- A = 36\n- B = 2 (remaining number)\n- C = 7\n- D = 3\n- E = 50\n- F = 10\n- G = 28\n- H = 13\n- I = 1\n- J = 5 (remaining number)\n- K = 19\n- L = 10\n- M = 45\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[36, 2, 7, 3, 50, 10, 28, 13, 1, 5, 19, 10, 45]>>>"
