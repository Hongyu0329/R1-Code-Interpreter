    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 1, 3, 4, 9, 16, 27, 36, 80, and 121 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **D = 3.0B**: This implies that D is three times B. The possible pairs (B, D) from the given numbers are (3, 9).\n\n2. **A + F = 52**: We need to find two numbers from the list that add up to 52. The possible pair is (16, 36).\n\n3. **D - H = -71**: This implies H = D + 71. Given D = 9, H must be 80.\n\n4. **B + I = 30**: With B = 3, I must be 27.\n\n5. **D + E = 13**: With D = 9, E must be 4.\n\n6. **I = 3.0D**: This condition is already satisfied with I = 27 and D = 9.\n\n7. **F = 4.0E**: With E = 4, F must be 16.\n\nNow, let's assign the numbers to each letter based on the above analysis:\n\n- A = 36 (from A + F = 52, F = 16)\n- B = 3 (from D = 3.0B, D = 9)\n- C = 1 (the only number left after assigning others)\n- D = 9 (from D = 3.0B)\n- E = 4 (from D + E = 13)\n- F = 16 (from F = 4.0E)\n- G = 121 (the only number left after assigning others)\n- H = 80 (from D - H = -71)\n- I = 27 (from B + I = 30)\n\nThus, the values for each letter in alphabetical order are:\n\n<<<[36, 3, 1, 9, 4, 16, 121, 80, 27]>>>"
