    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of each letter based on the given system of inequalities and the set of possible values. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identify the possible values for each letter:**\n   - The possible values are: 3, 9, 16, 27, 36, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225.\n\n2. **Analyze the inequalities:**\n\n   - **Equation 1:** \\( K - H = -150 \\)\n     - This implies \\( H = K + 150 \\).\n\n   - **Equation 2:** \\( G - K = 46 \\)\n     - This implies \\( G = K + 46 \\).\n\n   - **Equation 3:** \\( B - F = 70 \\)\n     - This implies \\( B = F + 70 \\).\n\n   - **Equation 4:** \\( K - A = 59 \\)\n     - This implies \\( A = K - 59 \\).\n\n   - **Equation 5:** \\( H = 3.0K \\)\n     - This implies \\( H = 3K \\).\n\n   - **Equation 6:** \\( C + H = 252 \\)\n     - This implies \\( C = 252 - H \\).\n\n   - **Equation 7:** \\( D = 4.0I \\)\n     - This implies \\( D = 4I \\).\n\n   - **Equation 8:** \\( C + F = 107 \\)\n     - This implies \\( F = 107 - C \\).\n\n   - **Equation 9:** \\( J - B = -102 \\)\n     - This implies \\( J = B - 102 \\).\n\n   - **Equation 10:** \\( G - I = 112 \\)\n     - This implies \\( I = G - 112 \\).\n\n3. **Solve the equations:**\n\n   - From **Equation 5**: \\( H = 3K \\). The only possible value for \\( K \\) that satisfies this equation is 75, because \\( 3 \\times 75 = 225 \\), which is a valid value for \\( H \\).\n\n   - With \\( K = 75 \\), from **Equation 1**: \\( H = K + 150 = 225 \\).\n\n   - From **Equation 4**: \\( A = K - 59 = 75 - 59 = 16 \\).\n\n   - From **Equation 2**: \\( G = K + 46 = 75 + 46 = 121 \\).\n\n   - From **Equation 10**: \\( I = G - 112 = 121 - 112 = 9 \\).\n\n   - From **Equation 7**: \\( D = 4I = 4 \\times 9 = 36 \\).\n\n   - From **Equation 6**: \\( C = 252 - H = 252 - 225 = 27 \\).\n\n   - From **Equation 8**: \\( F = 107 - C = 107 - 27 = 80 \\).\n\n   - From **Equation 3**: \\( B = F + 70 = 80 + 70 = 150 \\).\n\n   - From **Equation 9**: \\( J = B - 102 = 150 - 102 = 48 \\).\n\n4. **Verify the solution:**\n\n   - All values are distinct and match the given set of possible values.\n   - Each equation is satisfied with the calculated values.\n\n5. **List the values in alphabetical order:**\n\n   - A = 16\n   - B = 150\n   - C = 27\n   - D = 36\n   - E = 3 (remaining value)\n   - F = 80\n   - G = 121\n   - H = 225\n   - I = 9\n   - J = 48\n   - K = 75\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[16, 150, 27, 36, 3, 80, 121, 225, 9, 48, 75]>>>"
