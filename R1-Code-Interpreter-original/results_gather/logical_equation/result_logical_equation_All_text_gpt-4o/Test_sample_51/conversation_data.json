    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the correct values to each letter based on the given inequalities and the set of possible numbers. Let's analyze each inequality step by step:\n\n1. **K = 2.0E**: This implies that K is twice the value of E.\n\n2. **E - C = 72**: This means E is 72 more than C.\n\n3. **J - G = -205**: This implies J is 205 less than G.\n\n4. **A + F = 128**: The sum of A and F is 128.\n\n5. **C + F = 51**: The sum of C and F is 51.\n\n6. **G = 1.5K**: G is 1.5 times the value of K.\n\n7. **B + C = 19**: The sum of B and C is 19.\n\n8. **H = 3.0C**: H is three times the value of C.\n\n9. **F = 2.4J**: F is 2.4 times the value of J.\n\n10. **G + J = 245**: The sum of G and J is 245.\n\n11. **K > H**: K is greater than H.\n\nNow, let's assign the possible values to each letter:\n\n- Possible values: 3, 9, 16, 20, 39, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225.\n\nLet's start solving the inequalities:\n\n- From **E - C = 72**, we can deduce that E and C must be 75 and 3, respectively, because 75 - 3 = 72.\n\n- From **K = 2.0E**, K must be 150 because 2 * 75 = 150.\n\n- From **G = 1.5K**, G must be 225 because 1.5 * 150 = 225.\n\n- From **J - G = -205**, J must be 20 because 20 - 225 = -205.\n\n- From **G + J = 245**, this is consistent because 225 + 20 = 245.\n\n- From **F = 2.4J**, F must be 48 because 2.4 * 20 = 48.\n\n- From **A + F = 128**, A must be 80 because 80 + 48 = 128.\n\n- From **C + F = 51**, this is consistent because 3 + 48 = 51.\n\n- From **B + C = 19**, B must be 16 because 16 + 3 = 19.\n\n- From **H = 3.0C**, H must be 9 because 3 * 3 = 9.\n\n- From **K > H**, this is consistent because 150 > 9.\n\nNow, we have assigned values to all letters:\n\n- A = 80\n- B = 16\n- C = 3\n- D = 39 (the only remaining number)\n- E = 75\n- F = 48\n- G = 225\n- H = 9\n- I = 121 (the only remaining number)\n- J = 20\n- K = 150\n\nThe final answer in alphabetical order is:\n\n<<<[80, 16, 3, 39, 75, 48, 225, 9, 121, 20, 150]>>>"
