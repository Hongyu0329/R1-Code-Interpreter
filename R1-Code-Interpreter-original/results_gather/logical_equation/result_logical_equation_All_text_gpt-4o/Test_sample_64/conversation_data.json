    "To solve this problem, we need to assign each letter a unique number from the given set {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50} such that all the given inequalities are satisfied. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **E + H = 31**: E and H must be two numbers from the set that add up to 31. Possible pairs are (7, 24) and (15, 16).\n\n2. **F - K = 4**: F and K must be two numbers from the set where F is 4 more than K. Possible pairs are (5, 1), (7, 3), (10, 6), (15, 11), (16, 12), (24, 20), (28, 24), (36, 32), (45, 41), (50, 46). However, only (15, 11) and (24, 20) are valid pairs from the set.\n\n3. **D + K = 31**: D and K must be two numbers from the set that add up to 31. Possible pairs are (3, 28), (5, 26), (7, 24), (10, 21), (15, 16). However, only (15, 16) is a valid pair from the set.\n\n4. **I = 3.6L**: I must be 3.6 times L. From the set, the only valid pair is (36, 10).\n\n5. **J = 1.6E**: J must be 1.6 times E. From the set, the only valid pair is (24, 15).\n\n6. **C - I = -35**: C must be 35 less than I. From the set, the only valid pair is (1, 36).\n\n7. **A - H = -14**: A must be 14 less than H. From the set, the only valid pair is (10, 24).\n\n8. **I = 2.4E**: I must be 2.4 times E. From the set, the only valid pair is (24, 10).\n\n9. **D + G = 33**: D and G must be two numbers from the set that add up to 33. Possible pairs are (3, 30), (5, 28), (7, 26), (10, 23), (15, 18). However, only (15, 18) is a valid pair from the set.\n\n10. **J > G**: J must be greater than G. From the set, if J is 24, G can be 15.\n\nNow, let's assign the numbers to the letters based on the above analysis:\n\n- From condition 4, I = 36 and L = 10.\n- From condition 5, J = 24 and E = 15.\n- From condition 6, C = 1.\n- From condition 7, A = 10 and H = 24.\n- From condition 8, I = 24 and E = 10 (already satisfied).\n- From condition 9, D = 15 and G = 18.\n- From condition 2, F = 15 and K = 11.\n\nNow, let's list the values for each letter in alphabetical order:\n\n- A = 10\n- B = 2 (remaining number)\n- C = 1\n- D = 15\n- E = 10\n- F = 15\n- G = 18\n- H = 24\n- I = 36\n- J = 24\n- K = 11\n- L = 10\n- M = 50 (remaining number)\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[10, 2, 1, 15, 10, 15, 18, 24, 36, 24, 11, 10, 50]>>>"
