    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, and 96 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and M, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities. Let's analyze each inequality step by step:\n\n1. **B + I = 31**: B and I must be two numbers that add up to 31.\n\n2. **I = 1.5D**: I must be 1.5 times the value of D.\n\n3. **K - E = -2**: K is 2 less than E.\n\n4. **B + H = 57**: B and H must be two numbers that add up to 57.\n\n5. **C + F = 132**: C and F must be two numbers that add up to 132.\n\n6. **K - D = -13**: K is 13 less than D.\n\n7. **M = 2.0E**: M is twice the value of E.\n\n8. **A + G = 43**: A and G must be two numbers that add up to 43.\n\n9. **M > B**: M must be greater than B.\n\n10. **D - H = -34**: D is 34 less than H.\n\n11. **F = 4.0I**: F is four times the value of I.\n\n12. **I + L = 69**: I and L must be two numbers that add up to 69.\n\nNow, let's solve the inequalities:\n\n- From **I = 1.5D**, I must be a multiple of 1.5. The possible values for I are 15 and 24 (since 1.5 * 10 = 15 and 1.5 * 16 = 24). This gives D = 10 or 16.\n\n- From **F = 4.0I**, F must be four times I. If I = 24, then F = 96, which is not possible since 96 is assigned to M. Therefore, I = 15 and F = 60.\n\n- From **B + I = 31**, with I = 15, B = 16.\n\n- From **B + H = 57**, with B = 16, H = 41.\n\n- From **D - H = -34**, with H = 41, D = 7.\n\n- From **K - D = -13**, with D = 7, K = -6, which is not possible. Therefore, re-evaluate the possible values for D and I.\n\n- Re-evaluating, if D = 16, then I = 24, F = 96, which is not possible. Therefore, D = 10, I = 15, F = 60.\n\n- From **K - D = -13**, with D = 10, K = -3, which is not possible. Therefore, re-evaluate the possible values for D and I.\n\n- Re-evaluating, if D = 16, then I = 24, F = 96, which is not possible. Therefore, D = 10, I = 15, F = 60.\n\n- From **K - D = -13**, with D = 10, K = -3, which is not possible.
