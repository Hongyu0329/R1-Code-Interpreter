    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, and 96 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and M, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities. Let's analyze each inequality step by step:\n\n1. **F + J = 15**: The possible pairs (F, J) that sum to 15 from the given numbers are (10, 5) and (5, 10).\n\n2. **F - G = -91**: This implies G = F + 91. Since F + J = 15, F must be 5 (as 10 + 91 = 101, which is not in the list). Therefore, F = 5 and G = 96.\n\n3. **D = 3.5K**: D must be 3.5 times K. The possible pairs (D, K) are (35, 10), but 35 is not in the list. Therefore, we need to find another pair. Since D = 3.5K, and D must be a number from the list, we find that D = 35 and K = 10.\n\n4. **E + G = 141**: Since G = 96, E = 141 - 96 = 45.\n\n5. **A - K = 13**: Since K = 10, A = 10 + 13 = 23, but 23 is not in the list. Re-evaluate: A = 36 and K = 23, but 23 is not in the list. Re-evaluate: A = 45 and K = 32, but 32 is not in the list. Re-evaluate: A = 50 and K = 37, but 37 is not in the list. Re-evaluate: A = 28 and K = 15, but 15 is not in the list. Re-evaluate: A = 24 and K = 11, but 11 is not in the list. Re-evaluate: A = 16 and K = 3, but 3 is not in the list.
