    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, and 96 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and M, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities. Let's analyze each inequality step by step:\n\n1. **L = 1.4K**: This implies L must be 1.4 times K. The only pair of numbers from the list that satisfies this condition is L = 50 and K = 36 (since 50 = 1.4 * 36).\n\n2. **B + C = 73**: We need to find two numbers from the list that add up to 73. The possible pair is B = 28 and C = 45.\n\n3. **J - G = -86**: This implies J = G - 86. The only numbers that satisfy this are J = 10 and G = 96 (since 10 = 96 - 86).\n\n4. **D + H = 53**: We need two numbers that add up to 53. The possible pair is D = 5 and H = 48.\n\n5. **B + K = 50**: We already have B = 28 and K = 36. This condition is satisfied since 28 + 36 = 64, which is incorrect. Let's re-evaluate B and K. B = 24 and K = 36 satisfy B + K = 50.\n\n6. **L - A = -29**: This implies A = L + 29. With L = 50, A = 50 - 29 = 21, which is not in the list. Re-evaluate L and A. L = 45 and A = 16 satisfy L - A = -29.\n\n7. **F - I = -13**: This implies F = I - 13. The only numbers that satisfy this are F = 2 and I = 15 (since 2 = 15 - 13).\n\n8. **J = 2.0K**: We have J = 10 and K = 5, which satisfies J = 2 * K.\n\n9. **C + M = 52**: We have C = 45, so M = 52 - 45 = 7.\n\n10. **I > L**: We have I = 15 and L = 45, which does not satisfy I > L. Re-evaluate I and L. I = 50 and L = 36 satisfy I > L.\n\n11. **D + M = 74**: We have D = 5 and M = 7, which does not satisfy D + M = 74. Re-evaluate D and M. D = 24 and M = 50 satisfy D + M = 74.\n\n12. **M - B = -21**: We have M = 50 and B = 28, which satisfies M - B = -21.\n\nAfter re-evaluating and correcting the assignments, the final values for each letter are:\n\n- A = 16\n- B = 28\n- C = 45\n- D = 24\n- E = 3\n- F = 2\n- G = 96\n- H = 29\n- I = 50\n- J = 10\n- K = 5\n- L = 36\n- M = 50\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<[16, 28, 45, 24, 3, 2, 96, 29, 50, 10, 5, 36, 50]>>>"
