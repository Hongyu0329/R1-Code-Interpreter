    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the correct numbers to each letter based on the given inequalities and conditions. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **B + E = 170**: This means that the sum of the numbers assigned to B and E must equal 170.\n\n2. **H - C = -46**: This implies that C is 46 more than H.\n\n3. **K = 3.0G**: K is three times the value of G.\n\n4. **B + I = 230**: The sum of the numbers assigned to B and I must equal 230.\n\n5. **C - H = 46**: This is the same as condition 2, confirming that C is 46 more than H.\n\n6. **D = 3.0H**: D is three times the value of H.\n\n7. **C - D = -104**: This implies that D is 104 more than C.\n\n8. **H - J = 36**: H is 36 more than J.\n\n9. **A = 2.4E**: A is 2.4 times the value of E.\n\n10. **I - E = 60**: I is 60 more than E.\n\n11. **C - K = 112**: C is 112 more than K.\n\nNow, let's assign the numbers to the letters:\n\n- The numbers available are: 3, 9, 16, 20, 39, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225.\n\nLet's start solving the equations:\n\n- From **C - H = 46** and **H - C = -46**, we confirm that C = H + 46.\n- From **C - D = -104**, we have D = C + 104.\n- From **D = 3.0H**, we have D = 3H.\n- From **H - J = 36**, we have J = H - 36.\n- From **K = 3.0G**, we have K = 3G.\n- From **C - K = 112**, we have K = C - 112.\n- From **B + E = 170** and **B + I = 230**, we have I = E + 60.\n- From **A = 2.4E**, we have A = 2.4E.\n\nNow, let's assign the numbers:\n\n1. **H**: Since D = 3H and D = C + 104, we need to find a number for H such that 3H is one of the available numbers. The only number that fits is H = 39, because 3 * 39 = 117, which is not in the list, but if we check the available numbers, we find that D = 3 * 39 = 117 is not possible, so let's try another approach.\n\n2. **C**: From C = H + 46, if H = 39, then C = 39 + 46 = 85, which is not in the list. Let's try H = 48, then C = 48 + 46 = 94, which is not in the list. Let's try H = 75, then C = 75 + 46 = 121, which is in the list.\n\n3. **D**: From D = 3H, if H = 75, then D = 3 * 75 = 225, which is in the list.\n\n4. **K**: From C - K = 112, if C = 121, then K = 121 - 112 = 9, which is in the list.\n\n5. **G**: From K = 3G, if K = 9, then G = 9 / 3 = 3, which is in the list.\n\n6. **J**: From H - J = 36, if H = 75, then J = 75 - 36 = 39, which is in the list.\n\n7. **E**: From B + E = 170, let's try B = 150, then E = 170 - 150 = 20, which is in the list.\n\n8. **B**: From B + I = 230, if B = 150, then I = 230 - 150 = 80, which is in the list.\n\n9. **I**: From I - E = 60, if E = 20, then I = 20 + 60 = 80, which is consistent.\n\n10. **A**: From A = 2.4E, if E = 20, then A = 2.4 * 20 = 48, which is in the list.\n\nNow, we have assigned all the numbers:\n\n- A = 48\n- B = 150\n- C = 121\n- D = 225\n- E = 20\n- F = 16 (the only number left)\n- G = 3\n- H = 75\n- I = 80\n- J = 39\n- K = 9\n\nThe final answer in alphabetical order is:\n\n<<<[48, 150, 121, 225, 20, 16, 3, 75, 80, 39, 9]>>>"
