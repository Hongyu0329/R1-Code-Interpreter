    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the correct numbers to each letter based on the given system of inequalities and equations. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **A + I = 300**: This equation tells us that the sum of the values for A and I is 300.\n\n2. **E = 2.4C**: This equation indicates that E is 2.4 times the value of C.\n\n3. **G = 3.0K**: This equation indicates that G is 3 times the value of K.\n\n4. **J > A**: This inequality tells us that J is greater than A.\n\n5. **A - G = 66**: This equation tells us that A is 66 more than G.\n\n6. **J = 4.0C**: This equation indicates that J is 4 times the value of C.\n\n7. **I = 3.0A**: This equation indicates that I is 3 times the value of A.\n\n8. **F = 2.0A**: This equation indicates that F is 2 times the value of A.\n\n9. **I = 1.5F**: This equation indicates that I is 1.5 times the value of F.\n\n10. **A - C = 55**: This equation tells us that A is 55 more than C.\n\n11. **H - A = -59**: This equation tells us that H is 59 less than A.\n\nNow, let's solve these equations step by step:\n\n- From equation 7, **I = 3.0A**, we substitute into equation 1:  \n  A + 3.0A = 300  \n  4A = 300  \n  A = 75\n\n- Substitute A = 75 into equation 10:  \n  75 - C = 55  \n  C = 20\n\n- Substitute C = 20 into equation 2:  \n  E = 2.4 * 20  \n  E = 48\n\n- Substitute C = 20 into equation 6:  \n  J = 4.0 * 20  \n  J = 80\n\n- Substitute A = 75 into equation 8:  \n  F = 2.0 * 75  \n  F = 150\n\n- Substitute F = 150 into equation 9:  \n  I = 1.5 * 150  \n  I = 225\n\n- Substitute A = 75 into equation 5:  \n  75 - G = 66  \n  G = 9\n\n- Substitute G = 9 into equation 3:  \n  9 = 3.0K  \n  K = 3\n\n- Substitute A = 75 into equation 11:  \n  H - 75 = -59  \n  H = 16\n\nNow, we have the values for each letter:\n- A = 75\n- B = (not directly given, but the remaining number is 39)\n- C = 20\n- D = (not directly given, but the remaining number is 16)\n- E = 48\n- F = 150\n- G = 9\n- H = 16\n- I = 225\n- J = 80\n- K = 3\n\nThe numbers given are 3, 9, 16, 20, 39, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225. The numbers 121 and 39 are not used yet. Since B and D are not directly given, we assign the remaining numbers to them. D is already assigned 16, so B must be 39.\n\nThus, the final values in alphabetical order are:\n<<<[75, 39, 20, 16, 48, 150, 9, 16, 225, 80, 3]>>>"
