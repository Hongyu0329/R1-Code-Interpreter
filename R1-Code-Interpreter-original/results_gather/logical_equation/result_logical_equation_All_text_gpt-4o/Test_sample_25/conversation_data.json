    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given system of inequalities and equations to determine the value of each letter. Let's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the given numbers**: The numbers to be assigned to the letters are 3, 6, 9, 20, 32, 36, 80, 120, and 121.\n\n2. **Analyze the equations**:\n   - Equation 1: \\( D = 1.5I \\)\n   - Equation 2: \\( I = 2.5H \\)\n   - Equation 3: \\( C + H = 52 \\)\n   - Equation 4: \\( I = 4.0C \\)\n   - Equation 5: \\( C - H = -12 \\)\n   - Equation 6: \\( D + I = 200 \\)\n   - Equation 7: \\( B - H = -23 \\)\n   - Equation 8: \\( H = 1.6C \\)\n\n3. **Solve the equations**:\n   - From Equation 5: \\( C - H = -12 \\) implies \\( C = H - 12 \\).\n   - From Equation 3: \\( C + H = 52 \\).\n     - Substitute \\( C = H - 12 \\) into \\( C + H = 52 \\):\n     - \\( (H - 12) + H = 52 \\)\n     - \\( 2H - 12 = 52 \\)\n     - \\( 2H = 64 \\)\n     - \\( H = 32 \\)\n\n4. **Substitute \\( H = 32 \\) into other equations**:\n   - From Equation 8: \\( H = 1.6C \\)\n     - \\( 32 = 1.6C \\)\n     - \\( C = 32 / 1.6 = 20 \\)\n\n5. **Find \\( I \\) using Equation 4**:\n   - \\( I = 4.0C = 4.0 \\times 20 = 80 \\)\n\n6. **Find \\( D \\) using Equation 1**:\n   - \\( D = 1.5I = 1.5 \\times 80 = 120 \\)\n\n7. **Verify with Equation 6**:\n   - \\( D + I = 200 \\)\n   - \\( 120 + 80 = 200 \\) (Correct)\n\n8. **Find \\( B \\) using Equation 7**:\n   - \\( B - H = -23 \\)\n   - \\( B - 32 = -23 \\)\n   - \\( B = 32 - 23 = 9 \\)\n\n9. **Assign remaining numbers to A, E, F, G**:\n   - Remaining numbers: 3, 6, 36, 121\n   - Assign these numbers to A, E, F, G in any order since no specific conditions are given for these letters.\n\n10. **Final assignment**:\n    - A = 3\n    - B = 9\n    - C = 20\n    - D = 120\n    - E = 6\n    - F = 36\n    - G = 121\n    - H = 32\n    - I = 80\n\nThe final answer is: <<<[3, 9, 20, 120, 6, 36, 121, 32, 80]>>>"
