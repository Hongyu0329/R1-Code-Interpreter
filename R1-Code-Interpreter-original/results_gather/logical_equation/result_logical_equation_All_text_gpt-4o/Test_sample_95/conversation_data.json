    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, and 96 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and M, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **D - A = 43**: This implies that D is 43 units greater than A. The possible pairs (A, D) from the given numbers are (2, 45), (3, 46), (5, 48), (7, 50), and (10, 53). However, only (2, 45) is valid since 45 is in the list.\n\n2. **F = 1.5C**: F is 1.5 times C. The possible pairs (C, F) are (10, 15) and (16, 24).\n\n3. **A + F = 43**: Since A = 2, F must be 41. However, 41 is not in the list, so we need to reconsider. If A = 2, then F = 41 is not possible. Let's check if there's a mistake. Re-evaluating, if A = 2, then F = 41 is not possible. Let's check other conditions.\n\n4. **C = 1.6L**: C is 1.6 times L. The possible pairs (L, C) are (5, 8), (10, 16), and (15, 24). Only (10, 16) is valid since 16 is in the list.\n\n5. **L = 3.0J**: L is 3 times J. The possible pairs (J, L) are (5, 15) and (10, 30). Only (10, 30) is valid, but 30 is not in the list. Re-evaluate: (J, L) = (5, 15) is valid.\n\n6. **F - J = 31**: F is 31 units greater than J. If J = 5, then F = 36.\n\n7. **H > L**: H must be greater than L. If L = 15, H can be 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, or 96.\n\n8. **M = 4.5G**: M is 4.5 times G. The possible pairs (G, M) are (2, 9), (3, 13.5), (5, 22.5), (7, 31.5), (10, 45), and (16, 72). Only (10, 45) is valid.\n\n9. **E + G = 12**: E and G must sum to 12. The possible pairs (E, G) are (2, 10) and (3, 9). Only (2, 10) is valid.\n\n10. **J + K = 33**: J and K must sum to 33. If J = 5, then K = 28.\n\n11. **F = 3.6G**: F is 3.6 times G. If G = 10, then F = 36.\n\n12. **M > A**: M must be greater than A. If M = 45 and A = 2, this condition is satisfied.\n\nNow, let's assign the values based on the analysis:\n\n- A = 2\n- B = 3 (remaining number)\n- C = 16\n- D = 45\n- E = 2\n- F = 36\n- G = 10\n- H = 50 (greater than L = 15)\n- I = 7 (remaining number)\n- J = 5\n- K = 28\n- L = 15\n- M = 45\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[2, 3, 16, 45, 2, 36, 10, 50, 7, 5, 28, 15, 45]>>>"
