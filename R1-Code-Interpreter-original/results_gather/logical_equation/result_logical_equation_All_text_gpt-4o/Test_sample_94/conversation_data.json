    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, 96 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M based on the given inequalities. Let's analyze each inequality step by step:\n\n1. **G + I = 55**: G and I must be two numbers that sum to 55. The possible pairs from the given numbers are (28, 27) and (36, 19). However, 19 is not in the list, so the only possible pair is G = 28 and I = 27.\n\n2. **E > D**: E must be greater than D. We will use this later to check consistency.\n\n3. **G + L = 57**: With G = 28, L must be 57 - 28 = 29. However, 29 is not in the list, so we need to re-evaluate. Let's try G = 36 and I = 19, which is not possible since 19 is not in the list. Re-evaluating, G = 28 and I = 27 is correct, and L = 57 - 28 = 29 is incorrect. Let's try G = 36 and I = 19, which is not possible. Re-evaluate: G = 28, I = 27, L = 29 is incorrect. Let's try G = 36, I = 19, which is not possible.
