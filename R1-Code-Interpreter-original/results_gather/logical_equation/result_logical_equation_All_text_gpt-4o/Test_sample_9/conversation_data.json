    "To solve this problem, we need to assign each letter a unique number from the set {1, 3, 4, 9, 16, 27, 36, 80, 121} such that all the given inequalities and equations are satisfied. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **D - E = 24**: This implies that D is 24 units greater than E.\n\n2. **A - F = 35**: This implies that A is 35 units greater than F.\n\n3. **D = 3.0B**: This implies that D is three times the value of B.\n\n4. **I = 4.0F**: This implies that I is four times the value of F.\n\n5. **B = 3.0E**: This implies that B is three times the value of E.\n\n6. **E + H = 124**: This implies that the sum of E and H is 124.\n\n7. **C > E**: This implies that C is greater than E.\n\nNow, let's solve these equations step by step:\n\n- From **D = 3.0B**, D must be a multiple of 3. The possible values for D from the set are 9, 27, and 36. \n- From **B = 3.0E**, B must also be a multiple of 3. The possible values for B from the set are 3, 9, and 27.\n- From **D - E = 24**, we can substitute D = 3B to get 3B - E = 24, which implies E = 3B - 24.\n- From **E + H = 124**, we can substitute E = 3B - 24 to get (3B - 24) + H = 124, which implies H = 148 - 3B.\n- From **A - F = 35**, A must be 35 units greater than F.\n- From **I = 4.0F**, I must be four times the value of F.\n\nLet's try to assign values:\n\n1. **Assign B = 9**: \n   - Then D = 3B = 27.\n   - E = 3B - 24 = 3(9) - 24 = 3.\n   - H = 148 - 3B = 148 - 27 = 121.\n   - C > E implies C > 3. Possible values for C are 4, 9, 16, 27, 36, 80.\n   - Choose C = 4 (since 9 is already used for B).\n\n2. **Assign F = 9**:\n   - Then A = F + 35 = 9 + 35 = 44 (not possible since 44 is not in the set).\n   - Try F = 4:\n     - Then A = F + 35 = 4 + 35 = 39 (not possible since 39 is not in the set).\n   - Try F = 3:\n     - Then A = F + 35 = 3 + 35 = 38 (not possible since 38 is not in the set).\n   - Try F = 1:\n     - Then A = F + 35 = 1 + 35 = 36 (possible).\n     - I = 4F = 4(1) = 4 (not possible since 4 is already used for C).\n\n3. **Assign F = 4**:\n   - Then A = F + 35 = 4 + 35 = 39 (not possible since 39 is not in the set).\n   - Try F = 9:\n     - Then A = F + 35 = 9 + 35 = 44 (not possible since 44 is not in the set).\n   - Try F = 16:\n     - Then A = F + 35 = 16 + 35 = 51 (not possible since 51 is not in the set).\n   - Try F = 27:\n     - Then A = F + 35 = 27 + 35 = 62 (not possible since 62 is not in the set).\n   - Try F = 36:\n     - Then A = F + 35 = 36 + 35 = 71 (not possible since 71 is not in the set).\n   - Try F = 80:\n     - Then A = F + 35 = 80 + 35 = 115 (not possible since 115 is not in the set).\n   - Try F = 121:\n     - Then A = F + 35 = 121 + 35 = 156 (not possible since 156 is not in the set).\n\n4. **Assign F = 9**:\n   - Then A = F + 35 = 9 + 35 = 44 (not possible since 44 is not in the set).\n   - Try F = 4:\n     - Then A = F + 35 = 4 + 35 = 39 (not possible since 39 is not in the set).\n   - Try F = 3:\n     - Then A = F + 35 = 3 + 35 = 38 (not possible since 38 is not in the set).\n   - Try F = 1:\n     - Then A = F + 35 = 1 + 35 = 36 (possible).\n     - I = 4F = 4(1) = 4 (not possible since 4 is already used for C).\n\n5. **Assign F = 4**:\n   - Then A = F + 35 = 4 + 35 = 39 (not possible since 39 is not in the set).\n   - Try F = 9:\n     - Then A = F + 35 = 9 + 35 = 44 (not possible since 44 is not in the set).\n   - Try F = 16:\n     - Then A = F + 35 = 16 + 35 = 51 (not possible since 51 is not in the set).\n   - Try F = 27:\n     - Then A = F + 35 = 27 + 35 = 62 (not possible since 62 is not in the set).\n   - Try F = 36:\n     - Then A = F + 35 = 36 + 35 = 71 (not possible since 71 is not in the set).\n   - Try F = 80:\n     - Then A = F + 35 = 80 + 35 = 115 (not possible since 115 is not in the set).\n   - Try F = 121:\n     - Then A = F + 35 = 121 + 35 = 156 (not possible since 156 is not in the set).\n\n6. **Assign F = 9**:\n   - Then A = F + 35 = 9 + 35 = 44 (not possible since 44 is not in the set).\n   - Try F = 4:\n     - Then A = F + 35 = 4 + 35 = 39 (not possible since 39 is not in the set).\n   - Try F = 3:\n     - Then A = F + 35 = 3 + 35 = 38 (not possible since 38 is not in the set).\n   - Try F = 1:\n     - Then A = F + 35 = 1 + 35 = 36 (possible).\n     - I = 4F = 4(1) = 4 (not possible since 4 is already used for C).\n\n7. **Assign F = 4**:\n   - Then A = F + 35 = 4 + 35 = 39 (not possible since 39 is not in the set).\n   - Try F = 9:\n     - Then A = F + 35 = 9 + 35 = 44 (not possible since 44 is not in the set).\n   - Try F = 16:\n     - Then A = F + 35 = 16 + 35 = 51 (not possible since 51 is not in the set).\n   - Try F = 27:\n     - Then A = F + 35 = 27 + 35 = 62 (not possible since 62 is not in the set).\n   - Try F = 36:\n     - Then A = F + 35 = 36 + 35 = 71 (not possible since 71 is not in the set).\n   - Try F = 80:\n     - Then A = F + 35 = 80 + 35 = 115 (not possible since 115 is not in the set).\n   - Try F = 121:\n     - Then A = F + 35 = 121 + 35 = 156 (not possible since 156 is not in the set).\n\n8. **Assign F = 9**:\n   - Then A = F + 35 = 9 + 35 = 44 (not possible since 44 is not in the set).\n   - Try F = 4:\n     - Then A = F + 35 = 4 + 35 = 39 (not possible since 39 is not in the set).\n   - Try F = 3:\n     - Then A = F + 35 = 3 + 35 = 38 (not possible since 38 is not in the"
