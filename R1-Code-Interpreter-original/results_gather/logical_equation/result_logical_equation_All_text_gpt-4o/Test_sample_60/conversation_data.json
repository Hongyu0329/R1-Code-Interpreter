    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, and 50 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and M, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **A - G = -13**: This implies that G = A + 13.\n\n2. **B + C = 15**: B and C must be two numbers that add up to 15.\n\n3. **H = 4.8B**: H must be 4.8 times the value of B.\n\n4. **I - B = -3**: This implies that I = B - 3.\n\n5. **L - J = -5**: This implies that J = L + 5.\n\n6. **B > A**: B must be greater than A.\n\n7. **I = 2.0F**: I must be twice the value of F.\n\n8. **C - H = -14**: This implies that H = C + 14.\n\n9. **B - I = 3**: This implies that B = I + 3.\n\n10. **A - F = 2**: This implies that F = A - 2.\n\nNow, let's solve these equations step by step:\n\n- From condition 9, B = I + 3. From condition 4, I = B - 3. Solving these gives us B = 6 and I = 3. However, 6 and 3 are not in our list of numbers. Let's try another approach.\n\n- From condition 7, I = 2.0F. From condition 4, I = B - 3. Therefore, 2.0F = B - 3. \n\n- From condition 10, F = A - 2. Substituting F in the equation 2.0F = B - 3 gives us 2(A - 2) = B - 3, which simplifies to 2A - 4 = B - 3, or B = 2A - 1.\n\n- From condition 6, B > A, so 2A - 1 > A, which simplifies to A > 1.\n\n- From condition 1, G = A + 13. \n\n- From condition 2, B + C = 15. Substituting B = 2A - 1 gives us (2A - 1) + C = 15, or C = 16 - 2A.\n\n- From condition 8, C - H = -14, so H = C + 14. Substituting C = 16 - 2A gives us H = (16 - 2A) + 14 = 30 - 2A.\n\n- From condition 3, H = 4.8B. Substituting B = 2A - 1 gives us H = 4.8(2A - 1) = 9.6A - 4.8.\n\n- Equating the two expressions for H, we have 30 - 2A = 9.6A - 4.8. Solving for A gives us 30 + 4.8 = 11.6A, or A = 34.8 / 11.6 = 3.\n\n- If A = 3, then B = 2A - 1 = 5, C = 16 - 2A = 10, F = A - 2 = 1, G = A + 13 = 16, H = 30 - 2A = 24, I = B - 3 = 2, J = L + 5, and L = J - 5.\n\n- We need to assign the remaining numbers 7, 15, 28, 36, 45, and 50 to D, E, J, K, L, and M, ensuring that L - J = -5.\n\n- Assign L = 45 and J = 50, satisfying L - J = -5.\n\n- Assign the remaining numbers 7, 15, 28, 36 to D, E, K, and M. \n\n- Assign D = 7, E = 15, K = 28, M = 36.\n\nThus, the values for each letter are:\n\nA = 3, B = 5, C = 10, D = 7, E = 15, F = 1, G = 16, H = 24, I = 2, J = 50, K = 28, L = 45, M = 36.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[3, 5, 10, 7, 15, 1, 16, 24, 2, 50, 28, 45, 36]>>>"
