    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, and 50 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and M, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **F = 2.0E**: This implies F is twice the value of E. Therefore, F must be an even number.\n\n2. **B > E**: B must be greater than E.\n\n3. **A - H = 5**: The difference between A and H is 5.\n\n4. **D + L = 48**: The sum of D and L is 48.\n\n5. **B > J**: B must be greater than J.\n\n6. **B + J = 16**: The sum of B and J is 16.\n\n7. **A + B = 22**: The sum of A and B is 22.\n\n8. **A = 1.4E**: A is 1.4 times the value of E. This implies A must be a multiple of 7 since 1.4E = 7/5E.\n\n9. **G + J = 25**: The sum of G and J is 25.\n\n10. **C + E = 21**: The sum of C and E is 21.\n\nNow, let's solve these step by step:\n\n- From condition 6, B + J = 16, and condition 5, B > J, we can deduce possible pairs for (B, J) from the available numbers. The only pair that satisfies both conditions is (10, 6), but 6 is not in the list. So, let's try (15, 1) and (10, 6) again. The correct pair is (15, 1) because 1 is not in the list, so (10, 6) is the only valid pair.\n\n- From condition 7, A + B = 22, and knowing B = 10, we find A = 12, but 12 is not in the list. So, let's try (15, 7) for (B, J). This gives A = 7, which is in the list.\n\n- From condition 8, A = 1.4E, and A = 7, we find E = 5.\n\n- From condition 1, F = 2.0E, and E = 5, we find F = 10.\n\n- From condition 2, B > E, and B = 15, E = 5, this is satisfied.\n\n- From condition 3, A - H = 5, and A = 7, we find H = 2.\n\n- From condition 4, D + L = 48, we need to find a pair from the remaining numbers that sum to 48. The pair (28, 20) is not possible, but (36, 12) is possible. So, D = 36 and L = 12.\n\n- From condition 9, G + J = 25, and J = 1, we find G = 24.\n\n- From condition 10, C + E = 21, and E = 5, we find C = 16.\n\nNow, we assign the remaining numbers to the remaining letters:\n\n- I, K, and M are left with the numbers 3, 45, and 50. Assign them as I = 3, K = 45, and M = 50.\n\nFinally, the values for each letter in alphabetical order are:\n\nA = 7, B = 15, C = 16, D = 36, E = 5, F = 10, G = 24, H = 2, I = 3, J = 1, K = 45, L = 12, M = 50.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[7, 15, 16, 36, 5, 10, 24, 2, 3, 1, 45, 12, 50]>>>"
