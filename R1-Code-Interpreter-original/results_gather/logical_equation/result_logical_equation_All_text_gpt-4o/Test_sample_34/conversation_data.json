    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the given numbers to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K based on the system of inequalities provided. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identify the given numbers**: 3, 9, 16, 27, 36, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225.\n\n2. **Analyze the inequalities**:\n\n   - **G = 3.0C**: G is three times C. Possible pairs (C, G) from the given numbers are (3, 9), (9, 27), (16, 48), and (25, 75).\n\n   - **I = 4.0G**: I is four times G. This means G must be one of the numbers that, when multiplied by 4, results in another number from the list. Possible pairs (G, I) are (3, 12), (9, 36), (16, 64), (27, 108), (48, 192), (75, 300). Only (9, 36) is valid since both numbers are in the list.\n\n   - **A - G = 112**: A is 112 more than G. If G = 9, then A = 121.\n\n   - **K = 3.0J**: K is three times J. Possible pairs (J, K) are (3, 9), (9, 27), (16, 48), (25, 75), (50, 150), and (75, 225). Only (75, 225) is valid.\n\n   - **B + D = 64**: B and D add up to 64. Possible pairs (B, D) are (16, 48) and (27, 36).\n\n   - **E - B = 11**: E is 11 more than B. If B = 27, then E = 38, which is not in the list. If B = 16, then E = 27, which is in the list.\n\n   - **F = 2.0J**: F is twice J. If J = 75, then F = 150, which is in the list.\n\n   - **F - C = 147**: F is 147 more than C. If F = 150, then C = 3.\n\n   - **E - I = -9**: E is 9 less than I. If I = 36, then E = 27.\n\n   - **A + F = 271**: A and F add up to 271. If A = 121 and F = 150, this is satisfied.\n\n3. **Assign the numbers to the letters**:\n\n   - From the analysis, we have:\n     - C = 3\n     - G = 9\n     - I = 36\n     - A = 121\n     - J = 75\n     - K = 225\n     - B = 16\n     - D = 48\n     - E = 27\n     - F = 150\n\n4. **List the values in alphabetical order**:\n\n   - A = 121\n   - B = 16\n   - C = 3\n   - D = 48\n   - E = 27\n   - F = 150\n   - G = 9\n   - H = 80 (the only number left)\n   - I = 36\n   - J = 75\n   - K = 225\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[121, 16, 3, 48, 27, 150, 9, 80, 36, 75, 225]>>>"
