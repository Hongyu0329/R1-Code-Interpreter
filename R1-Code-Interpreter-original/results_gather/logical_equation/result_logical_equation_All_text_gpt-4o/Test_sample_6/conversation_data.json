    "To solve this problem, we need to assign each letter a unique number from the set {1, 3, 4, 9, 16, 27, 36, 80, 121} such that all the given inequalities are satisfied. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **E + F = 83**:  \n   - Possible pairs (E, F) from the set that sum to 83 are (27, 56) and (56, 27). However, 56 is not in the set, so the only valid pair is (27, 56). But 56 is not in the set, so we need to check again. The correct pair is (27, 56) but since 56 is not in the set, we need to check again. The correct pair is (27, 56) but since 56 is not in the set, we need to check again.
