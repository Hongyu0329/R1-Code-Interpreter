    "To solve this problem, we need to assign each letter a unique number from the given set {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50} such that all the inequalities and equations are satisfied. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **D - K = 23**: This implies that D is 23 units greater than K. The possible pairs (D, K) from the set that satisfy this are (28, 5) and (36, 13). However, 13 is not in the set, so (28, 5) is the only valid pair. Thus, D = 28 and K = 5.\n\n2. **L = 3.6A**: L must be 3.6 times A. The possible pairs (A, L) from the set are (5, 18) and (10, 36). However, 18 is not in the set, so (10, 36) is the only valid pair. Thus, A = 10 and L = 36.\n\n3. **A + H = 25**: Since A = 10, H must be 15 to satisfy this equation. Thus, H = 15.\n\n4. **K = 2.5C**: Since K = 5, C must be 2 to satisfy this equation. Thus, C = 2.\n\n5. **B > F**: B must be greater than F. We will determine B and F later, ensuring this condition is satisfied.\n\n6. **E = 2.4A**: Since A = 10, E must be 24 to satisfy this equation. Thus, E = 24.\n\n7. **H = 1.5A**: Since A = 10, H must be 15, which is consistent with our previous finding. Thus, H = 15.\n\n8. **I - G = -42**: This implies that G is 42 units greater than I. The possible pairs (I, G) from the set that satisfy this are (8, 50) and (1, 43). However, 8 and 43 are not in the set, so (1, 50) is the only valid pair. Thus, I = 1 and G = 50.\n\n9. **I - E = -21**: Since I = 1 and E = 24, this equation is satisfied. Thus, I = 1 and E = 24.\n\n10. **L = 1.5E**: Since L = 36 and E = 24, this equation is satisfied. Thus, L = 36 and E = 24.\n\nNow, we have determined the values for A, C, D, E, G, H, I, K, and L. The remaining letters are B, F, J, and M. The remaining numbers from the set are 3, 7, 16, 45.\n\n- **B > F**: We can assign B = 45 and F = 7 to satisfy this condition.\n\n- The remaining numbers are 3 and 16, which we can assign to J and M. Since there are no specific conditions for J and M, we can assign J = 3 and M = 16.\n\nThus, the values for each letter in alphabetical order are:\n\nA = 10, B = 45, C = 2, D = 28, E = 24, F = 7, G = 50, H = 15, I = 1, J = 3, K = 5, L = 36, M = 16.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[10, 45, 2, 28, 24, 7, 50, 15, 1, 3, 5, 36, 16]>>>"
