    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 1, 3, 4, 9, 16, 27, 36, 80, and 121 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I based on the given system of inequalities. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **G = 4.0A**: This implies that G is four times the value of A. The possible pairs (A, G) from the given numbers are (1, 4), (3, 12), (4, 16), (9, 36), and (27, 108). However, only (9, 36) is valid because 12 and 108 are not in the list, and 16 is not four times any number in the list.\n\n2. **G > A**: This condition is satisfied by the pair (9, 36) since 36 > 9.\n\n3. **C = 4.0D**: This implies that C is four times the value of D. The possible pairs (D, C) from the given numbers are (1, 4), (3, 12), and (4, 16). Only (4, 16) is valid because 12 is not in the list.\n\n4. **B + E = 148**: We need to find two numbers from the list that add up to 148. The only pair that satisfies this condition is (27, 121).\n\n5. **A - E = -117**: This implies E = A + 117. From the pair (A, E) = (9, 121), this condition is satisfied.\n\n6. **D - F = -71**: This implies F = D + 71. From the pair (D, F) = (4, 75), this condition is not satisfied because 75 is not in the list. However, if we consider (D, F) = (9, 80), this condition is satisfied.\n\n7. **C + H = 39**: We need to find a number H such that C + H = 39. With C = 16, H must be 23, but 23 is not in the list. Therefore, we need to reconsider the values of C and H. If C = 16, then H = 23, which is not possible. If C = 9, then H = 30, which is also not possible. If C = 4, then H = 35, which is not possible. If C = 36, then H = 3, which is possible.\n\nNow, let's assign the numbers to the letters based on the above analysis:\n\n- A = 9\n- B = 27\n- C = 36\n- D = 4\n- E = 121\n- F = 80\n- G = 36\n- H = 3\n- I = 1 (since it's the only number left)\n\nThus, the values for the letters in alphabetical order are:\n\n<<<[9, 27, 36, 4, 121, 80, 36, 3, 1]>>>"
