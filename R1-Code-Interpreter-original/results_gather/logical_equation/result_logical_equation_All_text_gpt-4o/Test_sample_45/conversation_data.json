    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given system of inequalities and equations step by step. We have 11 letters, each representing a specific number from the set {3, 9, 16, 20, 39, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225}. Let's go through the constraints one by one:\n\n1. **F = 2.4D**: This implies F is 2.4 times D. The possible pairs (D, F) from the set that satisfy this are (20, 48).\n\n2. **G = 1.5K**: This implies G is 1.5 times K. The possible pairs (K, G) from the set that satisfy this are (150, 225).\n\n3. **G + K = 375**: This confirms the pair (K, G) = (150, 225) since 150 + 225 = 375.\n\n4. **F - G = -177**: With F = 48 and G = 225, this equation is satisfied since 48 - 225 = -177.\n\n5. **A + D = 29**: With D = 20, A must be 9 to satisfy this equation since 9 + 20 = 29.\n\n6. **I - D = 19**: With D = 20, I must be 39 to satisfy this equation since 39 - 20 = 19.\n\n7. **A = 3.0H**: With A = 9, H must be 3 to satisfy this equation since 9 = 3 * 3.\n\n8. **F = 3.0B**: With F = 48, B must be 16 to satisfy this equation since 48 = 3 * 16.\n\n9. **F + K = 198**: With F = 48 and K = 150, this equation is satisfied since 48 + 150 = 198.\n\n10. **G > C**: With G = 225, C must be less than 225. The possible values for C are 3, 9, 16, 20, 39, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150. Since A, B, D, F, H, I, and K are already assigned, C can be 75.\n\n11. **J - F = 73**: With F = 48, J must be 121 to satisfy this equation since 121 - 48 = 73.\n\nNow, we have assigned values to all letters:\n\n- A = 9\n- B = 16\n- C = 75\n- D = 20\n- E = 80 (the only remaining number)\n- F = 48\n- G = 225\n- H = 3\n- I = 39\n- J = 121\n- K = 150\n\nThe final answer, in alphabetical order, is:\n\n<<<[9, 16, 75, 20, 80, 48, 225, 3, 39, 121, 150]>>>"
