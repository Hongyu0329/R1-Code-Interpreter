    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, and 96 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and M, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities. Let's analyze each inequality step by step:\n\n1. **I - E = -4**: This implies I = E - 4.\n\n2. **F = 2.5K**: F is 2.5 times K. This suggests that F must be a multiple of 2.5, and K must be a number that when multiplied by 2.5 results in one of the given numbers.\n\n3. **I = 1.5B**: I is 1.5 times B. This suggests that I must be a multiple of 1.5, and B must be a number that when multiplied by 1.5 results in one of the given numbers.\n\n4. **L - A = 33**: This implies L = A + 33.\n\n5. **E = 2.8H**: E is 2.8 times H. This suggests that E must be a multiple of 2.8, and H must be a number that when multiplied by 2.8 results in one of the given numbers.\n\n6. **C + M = 111**: The sum of C and M is 111.\n\n7. **L - C = -60**: This implies L = C - 60.\n\n8. **H = 2.0F**: H is twice F. This suggests that H must be twice the value of F.\n\n9. **F + L = 41**: The sum of F and L is 41.\n\n10. **K - E = -26**: This implies K = E - 26.\n\n11. **A + F = 8**: The sum of A and F is 8.\n\nNow, let's solve these equations step by step:\n\n- From equation 11, **A + F = 8**, we can deduce possible values for A and F. Since F must be a multiple of 2.5 (from equation 2), let's try F = 5 (the only number in the list that is a multiple of 2.5 and less than 8). This gives A = 3.\n\n- From equation 4, **L = A + 33**, we have L = 3 + 33 = 36.\n\n- From equation 9, **F + L = 41**, we have 5 + L = 41, so L = 36, which is consistent.\n\n- From equation 7, **L - C = -60**, we have C = L + 60 = 36 + 60 = 96.\n\n- From equation 6, **C + M = 111**, we have 96 + M = 111, so M = 15.\n\n- From equation 2, **F = 2.5K**, we have 5 = 2.5K, so K = 2.\n\n- From equation 10, **K - E = -26**, we have E = K + 26 = 2 + 26 = 28.\n\n- From equation 1, **I - E = -4**, we have I = E - 4 = 28 - 4 = 24.\n\n- From equation 3, **I = 1.5B**, we have 24 = 1.5B, so B = 16.\n\n- From equation 5, **E = 2.8H**, we have 28 = 2.8H, so H = 10.\n\n- From equation 8, **H = 2.0F**, we have 10 = 2.0F, so F = 5, which is consistent.\n\nNow, we have assigned values to A, B, C, E, F, H, I, K, L, and M. The remaining letters D, G, and J must be assigned the remaining numbers 7, 45, and 50. Since there are no specific constraints on D, G, and J, we can assign them in any order.\n\nThus, the final assignment is:\n- A = 3\n- B = 16\n- C = 96\n- D = 7\n- E = 28\n- F = 5\n- G = 45\n- H = 10\n- I = 24\n- J = 50\n- K = 2\n- L = 36\n- M = 15\n\nThe answer in alphabetical order is:\n<<<[3, 16, 96, 7, 28, 5, 45, 10, 24, 50, 2, 36, 15]>>>"
