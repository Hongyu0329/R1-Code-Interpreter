    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the given numbers to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K based on the system of inequalities and equations provided. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **F = 4.0C**: F is four times C. This suggests that F must be a multiple of 4, and C must be a number that when multiplied by 4 gives another number in the list.\n\n2. **J - A = -48**: J is 48 less than A. This means A must be greater than J by 48.\n\n3. **K - B = -75**: K is 75 less than B. This means B must be greater than K by 75.\n\n4. **J > C**: J must be greater than C.\n\n5. **B = 3.0A**: B is three times A. This suggests that B must be a multiple of 3, and A must be a number that when multiplied by 3 gives another number in the list.\n\n6. **B + C = 234**: The sum of B and C is 234.\n\n7. **F + J = 63**: The sum of F and J is 63.\n\n8. **H + K = 271**: The sum of H and K is 271.\n\n9. **A - I = 59**: A is 59 more than I.\n\n10. **C = 3.0E**: C is three times E. This suggests that C must be a multiple of 3, and E must be a number that when multiplied by 3 gives another number in the list.\n\nNow, let's assign the numbers to the letters:\n\n- From condition 5, B = 3A. The possible pairs (A, B) from the list are (3, 9) and (48, 150). However, (3, 9) does not satisfy condition 6 (B + C = 234), so A = 48 and B = 150.\n\n- From condition 2, J = A - 48 = 48 - 48 = 0. But 0 is not in the list, so we need to reconsider. Let's try A = 75 and B = 225. Then J = 75 - 48 = 27, which is in the list.\n\n- From condition 6, B + C = 234, so C = 234 - 225 = 9.\n\n- From condition 1, F = 4C = 4 * 9 = 36.\n\n- From condition 7, F + J = 63, so J = 63 - 36 = 27.\n\n- From condition 10, C = 3E, so E = C / 3 = 9 / 3 = 3.\n\n- From condition 9, A - I = 59, so I = A - 59 = 75 - 59 = 16.\n\n- From condition 8, H + K = 271. We have K = B - 75 = 225 - 75 = 150, so H = 271 - 150 = 121.\n\nNow, let's verify the assignments:\n\n- A = 75\n- B = 225\n- C = 9\n- D = 27 (not used in any condition, but fits the list)\n- E = 3\n- F = 36\n- G = 48 (not used in any condition, but fits the list)\n- H = 121\n- I = 16\n- J = 27\n- K = 150\n\nAll conditions are satisfied with these assignments. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[75, 225, 9, 27, 3, 36, 48, 121, 16, 27, 150]>>>"
