    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 3, 9, 16, 27, 36, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, and 225 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities. Let's analyze each inequality step by step:\n\n1. **C - I = 13**: This means C is 13 more than I. The possible pairs from the given numbers are (16, 3), (27, 16), (36, 27), (48, 36), (75, 62), (80, 67), (121, 108), (150, 137), and (225, 212). However, only (16, 3) is valid since both numbers must be from the given set.\n\n2. **G - I = 147**: This means G is 147 more than I. The possible pair is (150, 3) because 150 - 3 = 147.\n\n3. **A = 3.0D**: A is three times D. The possible pairs are (9, 3), (48, 16), and (225, 75).\n\n4. **G + J = 186**: G and J together sum to 186. With G = 150, J must be 36 because 150 + 36 = 186.\n\n5. **D + H = 123**: D and H together sum to 123. The possible pairs are (48, 75) and (75, 48).\n\n6. **F - A = -216**: F is 216 less than A. The possible pair is (9, 225) because 9 - 225 = -216.\n\n7. **H + J = 84**: H and J together sum to 84. With J = 36, H must be 48 because 48 + 36 = 84.\n\n8. **F + G = 159**: F and G together sum to 159. With G = 150, F must be 9 because 9 + 150 = 159.\n\n9. **A + B = 346**: A and B together sum to 346. With A = 225, B must be 121 because 225 + 121 = 346.\n\n10. **F = 3.0I**: F is three times I. With F = 9, I must be 3 because 9 = 3 * 3.\n\nNow, let's assign the values to each letter:\n\n- A = 225\n- B = 121\n- C = 16\n- D = 75\n- E = 27 (since E is not involved in any equation, it takes the remaining number)\n- F = 9\n- G = 150\n- H = 48\n- I = 3\n- J = 36\n- K = 80 (since K is not involved in any equation, it takes the remaining number)\n\nThe final answer, in alphabetical order, is:\n\n<<<[225, 121, 16, 75, 27, 9, 150, 48, 3, 36, 80]>>>"
