    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, and 96 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and M, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities. Let's analyze each inequality step by step:\n\n1. **I = 2.4F**: This implies that I must be 2.4 times the value of F. The possible values for F and I that satisfy this are F = 10 and I = 24.\n\n2. **D = 4.8C**: This implies that D must be 4.8 times the value of C. The possible values for C and D that satisfy this are C = 5 and D = 24.\n\n3. **D = 1.6F**: This implies that D must be 1.6 times the value of F. The possible values for F and D that satisfy this are F = 15 and D = 24.\n\n4. **B = 1.6L**: This implies that B must be 1.6 times the value of L. The possible values for L and B that satisfy this are L = 45 and B = 72. However, 72 is not in the list of available numbers, so we need to reconsider.\n\n5. **M = 3.5E**: This implies that M must be 3.5 times the value of E. The possible values for E and M that satisfy this are E = 28 and M = 96.\n\n6. **G - J = -17**: This implies that G must be 17 less than J. The possible values for G and J that satisfy this are G = 28 and J = 45.\n\n7. **H - B = 34**: This implies that H must be 34 more than B. The possible values for H and B that satisfy this are H = 50 and B = 16.\n\n8. **B = 3.2C**: This implies that B must be 3.2 times the value of C. The possible values for C and B that satisfy this are C = 5 and B = 16.\n\n9. **H > E**: This implies that H must be greater than E. With E = 28, H could be 36, 45, 50, or 96.\n\n10. **H + L = 60**: This implies that the sum of H and L must be 60. The possible values for H and L that satisfy this are H = 36 and L = 24.\n\n11. **I - C = 31**: This implies that I must be 31 more than C. The possible values for C and I that satisfy this are C = 5 and I = 36.\n\n12. **H > A**: This implies that H must be greater than A. With H = 50, A could be 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, or 45.\n\nNow, let's assign the values to each letter based on the above analysis:\n\n- A = 2 (since H > A and H = 50)\n- B = 16 (from B = 3.2C and B = 1.6L)\n- C = 5 (from B = 3.2C and D = 4.8C)\n- D = 24 (from D = 4.8C and D = 1.6F)\n- E = 28 (from M = 3.5E)\n- F = 15 (from D = 1.6F and I = 2.4F)\n- G = 28 (from G - J = -17)\n- H = 50 (from H - B = 34 and H + L = 60)\n- I = 36 (from I = 2.4F and I - C = 31)\n- J = 45 (from G - J = -17)\n- K = 7 (remaining number)\n- L = 10 (from H + L = 60)\n- M = 96 (from M = 3.5E)\n\nThus, the values for each letter in alphabetical order are:\n\n<<<[2, 16, 5, 24, 28, 15, 28, 50, 36, 45, 7, 10, 96]>>>"
