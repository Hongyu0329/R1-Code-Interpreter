    "To solve this problem, we need to assign each letter a unique number from the given set {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50} such that all the given inequalities and equations are satisfied. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **E + F = 8**: The possible pairs (E, F) from the set that sum to 8 are (1, 7) and (7, 1). Since both numbers must be unique, E and F must be 1 and 7 in some order.\n\n2. **C - D = 14**: The possible pairs (C, D) that satisfy this are (15, 1), (16, 2), (24, 10), (28, 14), (36, 22), (45, 31), and (50, 36). However, only (15, 1) and (24, 10) are valid since 1 and 10 are in the set.\n\n3. **A + M = 35**: The possible pairs (A, M) are (15, 20), (16, 19), (24, 11), (28, 7), and (36, -1). Only (28, 7) is valid since both numbers are in the set.\n\n4. **D + K = 3**: The only valid pair is (1, 2) since both numbers are in the set.\n\n5. **G + J = 60**: The possible pairs (G, J) are (10, 50), (15, 45), (24, 36), and (28, 32). Only (24, 36) is valid since both numbers are in the set.\n\n6. **B > F**: Since F is either 1 or 7, B must be greater than F. If F = 1, B can be any number greater than 1. If F = 7, B must be greater than 7.\n\n7. **H + I = 60**: The possible pairs (H, I) are (10, 50), (15, 45), (24, 36), and (28, 32). Only (24, 36) is valid since both numbers are in the set.\n\n8. **A - K = 5**: The possible pairs (A, K) are (7, 2), (10, 5), (15, 10), (16, 11), (24, 19), (28, 23), and (36, 31). Only (7, 2) is valid since both numbers are in the set.\n\n9. **G - H = 26**: The possible pairs (G, H) are (36, 10), (45, 19), and (50, 24). Only (50, 24) is valid since both numbers are in the set.\n\n10. **G - F = 45**: The possible pairs (G, F) are (50, 5) and (45, 0). Only (50, 5) is valid since both numbers are in the set.\n\nNow, let's assign the numbers to the letters based on the above analysis:\n\n- From condition 4, D = 1 and K = 2.\n- From condition 1, E = 7 and F = 1.\n- From condition 3, A = 28 and M = 7.\n- From condition 5, G = 50 and J = 10.\n- From condition 7, H = 24 and I = 36.\n- From condition 9, G = 50 and H = 24.\n- From condition 10, G = 50 and F = 5.\n\nNow, let's assign the remaining numbers:\n\n- B must be greater than F, so B = 15.\n- C = 16 (since C - D = 14 and D = 1).\n\nFinally, the values for each letter in alphabetical order are:\n\nA = 28, B = 15, C = 16, D = 1, E = 7, F = 5, G = 50, H = 24, I = 36, J = 10, K = 2, L = 3, M = 7.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[28, 15, 16, 1, 7, 5, 50, 24, 36, 10, 2, 3, 7]>>>"
