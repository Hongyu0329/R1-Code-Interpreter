    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, and 50 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and M, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **A - E = 4** and **E - A = -4**: These two conditions are equivalent and imply that E = A + 4.\n\n2. **I = 4.0J**: This means I is four times the value of J.\n\n3. **D - B = -14**: This implies D = B + 14.\n\n4. **H + M = 26**: The sum of H and M is 26.\n\n5. **L = 3.2A**: L is 3.2 times the value of A.\n\n6. **L = 1.6F**: L is 1.6 times the value of F.\n\n7. **F + L = 26**: The sum of F and L is 26.\n\n8. **H - I = -4**: This implies H = I + 4.\n\n9. **D = 1.5H**: D is 1.5 times the value of H.\n\nNow, let's solve these equations step by step:\n\n- From **L = 3.2A** and **L = 1.6F**, we can equate 3.2A = 1.6F, which simplifies to F = 2A.\n- From **F + L = 26**, substitute F = 2A and L = 3.2A to get 2A + 3.2A = 26, which simplifies to 5.2A = 26. Solving for A gives A = 5.\n- With A = 5, we find F = 2A = 10 and L = 3.2A = 16.\n- From **A - E = 4**, we have E = A + 4 = 9.\n- From **I = 4.0J**, we need to find values for I and J. The possible values for I are 24, 28, 36, 45, and 50. The only value that is a multiple of 4 is 24, so I = 24 and J = 6.\n- From **H - I = -4**, we have H = I + 4 = 28.\n- From **H + M = 26**, we have M = 26 - H = 26 - 28 = -2. However, this is not possible since M must be a positive number from the given set. Let's re-evaluate:\n  - If H = 28, then M = 26 - 28 = -2, which is incorrect. Let's try another approach:\n  - If H = 16 (since 28 is not possible), then M = 26 - 16 = 10.\n- From **D = 1.5H**, with H = 16, we have D = 1.5 * 16 = 24. However, 24 is already assigned to I. Let's try another value for H:\n  - If H = 15, then M = 26 - 15 = 11, which is not in the set. Let's try H = 10:\n  - If H = 10, then M = 26 - 10 = 16, which is already assigned to L. Let's try H = 24:\n  - If H = 24, then M = 26 - 24 = 2, which is possible.\n- From **D = 1.5H**, with H = 24, we have D = 1.5 * 24 = 36.\n- From **D - B = -14**, we have B = D - 14 = 36 - 14 = 22, which is not in the set. Let's try another value for D:\n  - If D = 36, then B = 36 - 14 = 22, which is not possible. Let's try D = 45:\n  - If D = 45, then B = 45 - 14 = 31, which is not possible. Let's try D = 50:\n  - If D = 50, then B = 50 - 14 = 36, which is not possible. Let's try D = 28:\n  - If D = 28, then B = 28 - 14 = 14, which is not possible. Let's try D = 24:\n  - If D = 24, then B = 24 - 14 = 10, which is possible.\n- Now, we have assigned values to A, B, D, E, F, H, I, J, L, and M. The remaining letters are C, G, and K. The remaining numbers are 3, 7, and 45.\n- Assign C = 3, G = 7, and K = 45.\n\nThe final assignment of values is:\n- A = 5\n- B = 10\n- C = 3\n- D = 24\n- E = 9\n- F = 10\n- G = 7\n- H = 24\n- I = 24\n- J = 6\n- K = 45\n- L = 16\n- M = 2\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n<<<[5, 10, 3, 24, 9, 10, 7, 24, 24, 6, 45, 16, 2]>>>"
