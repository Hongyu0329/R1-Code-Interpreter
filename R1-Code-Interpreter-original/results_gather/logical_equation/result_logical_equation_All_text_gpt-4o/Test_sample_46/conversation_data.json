    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the correct numbers to each letter based on the given inequalities and equations. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **A + F = 196**: This equation suggests that the sum of the numbers assigned to A and F is 196.\n\n2. **G - D = -6**: This equation suggests that the number assigned to G is 6 less than the number assigned to D.\n\n3. **G - A = -72**: This equation suggests that the number assigned to G is 72 less than the number assigned to A.\n\n4. **E = 3.0A**: This equation suggests that the number assigned to E is three times the number assigned to A.\n\n5. **B > I**: This inequality suggests that the number assigned to B is greater than the number assigned to I.\n\n6. **K - A = 75**: This equation suggests that the number assigned to K is 75 more than the number assigned to A.\n\n7. **H - F = -41**: This equation suggests that the number assigned to H is 41 less than the number assigned to F.\n\n8. **B - G = 36**: This equation suggests that the number assigned to B is 36 more than the number assigned to G.\n\n9. **A - H = -5**: This equation suggests that the number assigned to A is 5 more than the number assigned to H.\n\n10. **E - A = 150**: This equation suggests that the number assigned to E is 150 more than the number assigned to A.\n\n11. **H - J = 64**: This equation suggests that the number assigned to H is 64 more than the number assigned to J.\n\nNow, let's solve these equations step by step:\n\n- From equation 3, **G = A - 72**.\n- From equation 6, **K = A + 75**.\n- From equation 10, **E = A + 150**.\n- From equation 4, **E = 3A**. Combining with equation 10, we have **3A = A + 150**, which simplifies to **2A = 150**, so **A = 75**.\n- Substituting **A = 75** into **G = A - 72**, we get **G = 3**.\n- Substituting **A = 75** into **K = A + 75**, we get **K = 150**.\n- Substituting **A = 75** into **E = A + 150**, we get **E = 225**.\n- From equation 1, **A + F = 196**, substituting **A = 75**, we get **F = 121**.\n- From equation 9, **A - H = -5**, substituting **A = 75**, we get **H = 80**.\n- From equation 7, **H - F = -41**, substituting **H = 80**, we get **F = 121**, which is consistent.\n- From equation 11, **H - J = 64**, substituting **H = 80**, we get **J = 16**.\n- From equation 2, **G - D = -6**, substituting **G = 3**, we get **D = 9**.\n- From equation 8, **B - G = 36**, substituting **G = 3**, we get **B = 39**.\n- From equation 5, **B > I**, and the remaining number is **48**, so **I = 48**.\n\nNow, we have all the values for each letter:\n\n- A = 75\n- B = 39\n- C = 20\n- D = 9\n- E = 225\n- F = 121\n- G = 3\n- H = 80\n- I = 48\n- J = 16\n- K = 150\n\nThe final answer in alphabetical order is:\n\n<<<[75, 39, 20, 9, 225, 121, 3, 80, 48, 16, 150]>>>"
