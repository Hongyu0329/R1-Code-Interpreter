    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 3, 9, 16, 20, 39, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, and 225 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities. Let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **J + K = 271**: The only pair of numbers that sum to 271 is 121 and 150. Therefore, J and K must be 121 and 150 in some order.\n\n2. **G > I**: This inequality will help us later when we have more information about G and I.\n\n3. **E + J = 141**: Since J is either 121 or 150, and E + J = 141, E must be 20 (since 141 - 121 = 20). Therefore, J = 121 and E = 20.\n\n4. **A + C = 300**: We need to find two numbers from the list that sum to 300. The only pair that works is 75 and 225. Therefore, A and C must be 75 and 225 in some order.\n\n5. **G + K = 230**: Since K is 150, G must be 80 (since 230 - 150 = 80). Therefore, G = 80.\n\n6. **B - K = -141**: Since K is 150, B must be 9 (since 9 - 150 = -141). Therefore, B = 9.\n\n7. **D - C = -209**: Since C is 225, D must be 16 (since 16 - 225 = -209). Therefore, D = 16.\n\n8. **A + I = 78**: Since A is 75, I must be 3 (since 75 + 3 = 78). Therefore, I = 3.\n\n9. **F - D = 23**: Since D is 16, F must be 39 (since 39 - 16 = 23). Therefore, F = 39.\n\n10. **E - H = -28**: Since E is 20, H must be 48 (since 20 - 48 = -28). Therefore, H = 48.\n\n11. **H + K = 198**: Since H is 48 and K is 150, this equation is satisfied (48 + 150 = 198).\n\nNow, let's list the values for each letter in alphabetical order:\n\n- A = 75\n- B = 9\n- C = 225\n- D = 16\n- E = 20\n- F = 39\n- G = 80\n- H = 48\n- I = 3\n- J = 121\n- K = 150\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[75, 9, 225, 16, 20, 39, 80, 48, 3, 121, 150]>>>"
