    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 3, 6, 9, 20, 32, 36, 80, 120, and 121 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities. Let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **G = 1.5C**: This implies that G is 1.5 times the value of C. Among the given numbers, 9 and 6 are candidates for C because 1.5 times 6 is 9, and 1.5 times 9 is not an integer. Therefore, C = 6 and G = 9.\n\n2. **E = 1.8D**: This implies that E is 1.8 times the value of D. Among the given numbers, 20 and 36 are candidates for D because 1.8 times 20 is 36. Therefore, D = 20 and E = 36.\n\n3. **D + I = 141**: Since D = 20, I must be 141 - 20 = 121.\n\n4. **B - H = -88**: This implies B = H - 88.\n\n5. **H + I = 241**: Since I = 121, H must be 241 - 121 = 120.\n\n6. **H - G = 111**: Since H = 120 and G = 9, this equation is satisfied because 120 - 9 = 111.\n\n7. **H - B = 88**: Since H = 120, B must be 120 - 88 = 32.\n\n8. **A + I = 201**: Since I = 121, A must be 201 - 121 = 80.\n\nNow, we have assigned values to A, B, C, D, E, G, H, and I. The only number left is 3, which must be assigned to F.\n\nLet's list the values in alphabetical order:\n\n- A = 80\n- B = 32\n- C = 6\n- D = 20\n- E = 36\n- F = 3\n- G = 9\n- H = 120\n- I = 121\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[80, 32, 6, 20, 36, 3, 9, 120, 121]>>>"
