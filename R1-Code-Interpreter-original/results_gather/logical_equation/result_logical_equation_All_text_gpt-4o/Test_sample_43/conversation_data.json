    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the given numbers to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K based on the system of inequalities provided. Let's analyze each inequality step by step:\n\n1. **J - B = 27**: This means J is 27 more than B.\n\n2. **K - H = 123**: This means K is 123 more than H.\n\n3. **C - I = -71**: This means C is 71 less than I.\n\n4. **I - C = 71**: This is the same as the previous inequality, confirming that I is 71 more than C.\n\n5. **K = 2.0J**: This means K is twice the value of J.\n\n6. **C - B = -39**: This means C is 39 less than B.\n\n7. **G - E = -33**: This means G is 33 less than E.\n\n8. **A + D = 346**: The sum of A and D is 346.\n\n9. **C = 3.0G**: This means C is three times the value of G.\n\n10. **E - B = -12**: This means E is 12 less than B.\n\nNow, let's assign the numbers to the letters:\n\n- The numbers given are: 3, 9, 16, 27, 36, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225.\n\n- From **K = 2.0J**, K must be twice J. The only pair that satisfies this from the given numbers is J = 75 and K = 150.\n\n- From **J - B = 27**, with J = 75, B must be 48.\n\n- From **E - B = -12**, with B = 48, E must be 36.\n\n- From **G - E = -33**, with E = 36, G must be 3.\n\n- From **C = 3.0G**, with G = 3, C must be 9.\n\n- From **C - I = -71**, with C = 9, I must be 80.\n\n- From **A + D = 346**, the only numbers left that sum to 346 are A = 121 and D = 225.\n\n- From **K - H = 123**, with K = 150, H must be 27.\n\nNow, let's list the values for each letter in alphabetical order:\n\n- A = 121\n- B = 48\n- C = 9\n- D = 225\n- E = 36\n- F = 16 (the only number left)\n- G = 3\n- H = 27\n- I = 80\n- J = 75\n- K = 150\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[121, 48, 9, 225, 36, 16, 3, 27, 80, 75, 150]>>>"
