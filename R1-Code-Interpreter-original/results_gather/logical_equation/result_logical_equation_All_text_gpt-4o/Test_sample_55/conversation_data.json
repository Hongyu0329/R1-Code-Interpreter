    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 3, 9, 16, 20, 39, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, and 225 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities. Let's analyze each inequality step by step:\n\n1. **C - K = -17**: This implies C = K + 17.\n\n2. **J = 2.0D**: J is twice the value of D.\n\n3. **G - K = 205**: This implies G = K + 205.\n\n4. **E + H = 119**: The sum of E and H is 119.\n\n5. **C - J = -147**: This implies C = J - 147.\n\n6. **F + K = 36**: The sum of F and K is 36.\n\n7. **F + G = 241**: The sum of F and G is 241.\n\n8. **H - F = 64**: This implies H = F + 64.\n\n9. **I - B = -39**: This implies I = B - 39.\n\n10. **D + K = 95**: The sum of D and K is 95.\n\n11. **B + J = 198**: The sum of B and J is 198.\n\nNow, let's solve these equations step by step:\n\n- From equation 3, G = K + 205. Since G must be 225 (the largest number), K must be 20 (225 - 205 = 20).\n\n- From equation 6, F + K = 36. Since K = 20, F = 16 (36 - 20 = 16).\n\n- From equation 7, F + G = 241. Since F = 16, G = 225 (241 - 16 = 225).\n\n- From equation 10, D + K = 95. Since K = 20, D = 75 (95 - 20 = 75).\n\n- From equation 2, J = 2.0D. Since D = 75, J = 150 (2 * 75 = 150).\n\n- From equation 11, B + J = 198. Since J = 150, B = 48 (198 - 150 = 48).\n\n- From equation 9, I - B = -39. Since B = 48, I = 9 (48 - 39 = 9).\n\n- From equation 5, C - J = -147. Since J = 150, C = 3 (150 - 147 = 3).\n\n- From equation 1, C - K = -17. Since C = 3, K = 20 (3 + 17 = 20).\n\n- From equation 4, E + H = 119. We have E and H left as 39 and 80. Since H = F + 64 and F = 16, H = 80 (16 + 64 = 80), and E = 39 (119 - 80 = 39).\n\nNow, we have all the values:\n\n- A = 121 (the only number left)\n- B = 48\n- C = 3\n- D = 75\n- E = 39\n- F = 16\n- G = 225\n- H = 80\n- I = 9\n- J = 150\n- K = 20\n\nThe final answer in alphabetical order is:\n\n<<<[121, 48, 3, 75, 39, 16, 225, 80, 9, 150, 20]>>>"
