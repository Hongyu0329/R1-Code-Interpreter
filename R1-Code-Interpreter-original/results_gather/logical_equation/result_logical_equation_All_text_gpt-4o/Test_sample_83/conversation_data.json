    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, 96 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M based on the given inequalities. Let's analyze each inequality step by step:\n\n1. **E - D = 25**: This means E is 25 more than D.\n\n2. **H + I = 103**: The sum of H and I is 103.\n\n3. **E = 2.8M**: E is 2.8 times M.\n\n4. **C + I = 120**: The sum of C and I is 120.\n\n5. **A + I = 101**: The sum of A and I is 101.\n\n6. **I - J = 51**: I is 51 more than J.\n\n7. **I + J = 141**: The sum of I and J is 141.\n\n8. **H - I = -89**: H is 89 less than I.\n\n9. **E = 4.0H**: E is 4 times H.\n\n10. **G = 3.0A**: G is 3 times A.\n\n11. **G - E = -13**: G is 13 less than E.\n\nNow, let's solve these equations:\n\n- From equations 6 and 7, we have:\n  - I - J = 51\n  - I + J = 141\n  - Solving these, we get I = 96 and J = 45.\n\n- From equation 8, H - I = -89, we have:\n  - H = I - 89 = 96 - 89 = 7.\n\n- From equation 9, E = 4.0H, we have:\n  - E = 4 * 7 = 28.\n\n- From equation 1, E - D = 25, we have:\n  - D = E - 25 = 28 - 25 = 3.\n\n- From equation 3, E = 2.8M, we have:\n  - M = E / 2.8 = 28 / 2.8 = 10.\n\n- From equation 11, G - E = -13, we have:\n  - G = E - 13 = 28 - 13 = 15.\n\n- From equation 10, G = 3.0A, we have:\n  - A = G / 3 = 15 / 3 = 5.\n\n- From equation 5, A + I = 101, we have:\n  - A = 5, I = 96, so this equation is satisfied.\n\n- From equation 4, C + I = 120, we have:\n  - C = 120 - I = 120 - 96 = 24.\n\nNow, we have assigned values to A, C, D, E, G, H, I, J, and M. The remaining numbers are 2, 16, 36, 50, which need to be assigned to B, F, K, and L.\n\n- The numbers left are 2, 16, 36, 50. We can assign them to B, F, K, and L in any order since there are no constraints on these letters.\n\nLet's assign:\n- B = 2\n- F = 16\n- K = 36\n- L = 50\n\nNow, we have all the letters assigned:\n\n- A = 5\n- B = 2\n- C = 24\n- D = 3\n- E = 28\n- F = 16\n- G = 15\n- H = 7\n- I = 96\n- J = 45\n- K = 36\n- L = 50\n- M = 10\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<[5, 2, 24, 3, 28, 16, 15, 7, 96, 45, 36, 50, 10]>>>"
