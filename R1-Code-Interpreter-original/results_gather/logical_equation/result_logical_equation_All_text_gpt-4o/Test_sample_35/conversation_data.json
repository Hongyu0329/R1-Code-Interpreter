    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of each letter based on the given system of inequalities and the set of possible numbers. Let's analyze the constraints step by step:\n\n1. **E = 1.5K**: This implies E is 1.5 times K.\n\n2. **D + I = 155**: The sum of D and I is 155.\n\n3. **K = 2.0D**: K is twice the value of D.\n\n4. **E = 3.0D**: E is three times the value of D.\n\n5. **D - C = -46**: C is 46 more than D.\n\n6. **F + H = 51**: The sum of F and H is 51.\n\n7. **H + I = 83**: The sum of H and I is 83.\n\n8. **F = 3.0G**: F is three times the value of G.\n\n9. **E + K = 375**: The sum of E and K is 375.\n\n10. **F - D = -27**: D is 27 more than F.\n\nNow, let's solve these equations:\n\n- From **3** and **4**, we have K = 2D and E = 3D. Substituting these into **9** gives:\n  - 3D + 2D = 375\n  - 5D = 375\n  - D = 75\n\n- Using D = 75 in **3**, we find K:\n  - K = 2 * 75 = 150\n\n- Using D = 75 in **4**, we find E:\n  - E = 3 * 75 = 225\n\n- From **2**, D + I = 155:\n  - 75 + I = 155\n  - I = 80\n\n- From **5**, D - C = -46:\n  - 75 - C = -46\n  - C = 121\n\n- From **10**, F - D = -27:\n  - F - 75 = -27\n  - F = 48\n\n- From **8**, F = 3G:\n  - 48 = 3G\n  - G = 16\n\n- From **6**, F + H = 51:\n  - 48 + H = 51\n  - H = 3\n\n- From **7**, H + I = 83:\n  - 3 + 80 = 83 (This is consistent)\n\nNow, we have determined the values for D, E, F, G, H, I, K, and C. The remaining letters are A, B, and J. The numbers left are 9, 27, and 36. We can assign these numbers to A, B, and J in any order since there are no constraints involving these letters.\n\nLet's assign:\n- A = 9\n- B = 27\n- J = 36\n\nThus, the values for each letter in alphabetical order are:\n\nA = 9, B = 27, C = 121, D = 75, E = 225, F = 48, G = 16, H = 3, I = 80, J = 36, K = 150.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<[9, 27, 121, 75, 225, 48, 16, 3, 80, 36, 150]>>>"
