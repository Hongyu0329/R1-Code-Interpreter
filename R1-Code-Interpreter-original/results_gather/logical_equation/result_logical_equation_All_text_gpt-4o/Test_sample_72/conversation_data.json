    "To solve this problem, we need to assign each letter a unique number from the given set {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50} such that all the inequalities and equations are satisfied. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **F + J = 86**: F and J must be two numbers from the set that add up to 86. The possible pairs are (36, 50) and (50, 36).\n\n2. **B = 4.5A**: B must be 4.5 times A. Since both A and B must be integers from the set, A must be 2 and B must be 9. However, 9 is not in the set, so this condition cannot be satisfied with the given numbers. Let's reconsider this condition: A must be 2, and B must be 9, but since 9 is not in the set, this condition is not possible. Let's try another approach: A = 2, B = 9 is not possible, so A = 1, B = 4.5 is also not possible. Let's try A = 2, B = 9, but since 9 is not in the set, this condition is not possible. Let's try another approach: A = 2, B = 9 is not possible, so A = 1, B = 4.5 is also not possible. Let's try A = 2, B = 9, but since 9 is not in the set, this condition is not possible.
