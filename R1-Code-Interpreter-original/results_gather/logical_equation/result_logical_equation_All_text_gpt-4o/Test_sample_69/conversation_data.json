    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, and 50 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and M, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities. Let's analyze each inequality step by step:\n\n1. **F + H = 6**: The possible pairs (F, H) that sum to 6 from the given numbers are (1, 5) and (5, 1). However, since H = 2.5B (inequality 6), H must be a multiple of 2.5, which is not possible with the given numbers. Therefore, we need to reconsider the possible values for F and H.\n\n2. **E = 2.4D**: E must be 2.4 times D. The possible pairs (D, E) from the given numbers are (5, 12), but 12 is not in the list. Therefore, we need to find another pair that satisfies this condition.\n\n3. **B = 2.0F**: B must be twice F. The possible pairs (F, B) are (1, 2) and (5, 10).\n\n4. **C = 3.0M**: C must be three times M. The possible pairs (M, C) are (5, 15) and (10, 30), but 30 is not in the list. Therefore, M = 5 and C = 15.\n\n5. **I - B = 34**: I must be 34 more than B. The possible pairs (B, I) are (1, 35), (2, 36), (3, 37), (5, 39), (7, 41), (10, 44), (15, 49), but only (2, 36) fits within the given numbers.\n\n6. **H = 2.5B**: H must be 2.5 times B. The possible pairs (B, H) are (2, 5).\n\n7. **E + M = 39**: E and M must sum to 39. The possible pairs (E, M) are (24, 15) and (15, 24), but only (24, 15) fits within the given numbers.\n\n8. **L = 4.0J**: L must be four times J. The possible pairs (J, L) are (7, 28).\n\n9. **M = 3.0H**: M must be three times H. The possible pairs (H, M) are (5, 15).\n\n10. **L = 2.8D**: L must be 2.8 times D. The possible pairs (D, L) are (10, 28).\n\nNow, let's assign the numbers to the letters based on the above analysis:\n\n- **F = 1**: From inequality 3, B = 2.0F, so B = 2.\n- **H = 5**: From inequality 6, H = 2.5B, so B = 2.\n- **D = 10**: From inequality 10, L = 2.8D, so L = 28.\n- **E = 24**: From inequality 2, E = 2.4D, so D = 10.\n- **M = 15**: From inequality 9, M = 3.0H, so H = 5.\n- **C = 45**: From inequality 4, C = 3.0M, so M = 15.\n- **I = 36**: From inequality 5, I - B = 34, so B = 2.\n- **J = 7**: From inequality 8, L = 4.0J, so L = 28.\n- **L = 28**: From inequality 8, L = 4.0J, so J = 7.\n- **A, G, K**: The remaining numbers are 3, 16, and 50. Assign them to A, G, and K in any order.\n\nThus, the final assignment is:\n- A = 3\n- B = 2\n- C = 45\n- D = 10\n- E = 24\n- F = 1\n- G = 16\n- H = 5\n- I = 36\n- J = 7\n- K = 50\n- L = 28\n- M = 15\n\nThe answer in alphabetical order is:\n<<<[3, 2, 45, 10, 24, 1, 16, 5, 36, 7, 50, 28, 15]>>>"
