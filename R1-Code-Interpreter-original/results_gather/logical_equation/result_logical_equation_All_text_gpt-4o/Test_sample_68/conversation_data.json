    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, and 50 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and M, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities and equations. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **B + L = 35**: B and L must be two numbers from the list that add up to 35.\n\n2. **J > D**: J must be a number greater than D.\n\n3. **L - J = -8**: This implies L = J - 8.\n\n4. **I = 3.6H**: I must be 3.6 times H.\n\n5. **B + I = 64**: B and I must add up to 64.\n\n6. **H + I = 46**: H and I must add up to 46.\n\n7. **C + L = 31**: C and L must add up to 31.\n\n8. **G + K = 19**: G and K must add up to 19.\n\n9. **M - J = 30**: M must be 30 more than J.\n\n10. **K = 3.2E**: K must be 3.2 times E.\n\nNow, let's solve these equations:\n\n- From **(4)** and **(6)**, we have two equations involving H and I:\n  - I = 3.6H\n  - H + I = 46\n\n  Substituting I = 3.6H into H + I = 46 gives:\n  - H + 3.6H = 46\n  - 4.6H = 46\n  - H = 10\n\n  Substituting H = 10 into I = 3.6H gives:\n  - I = 36\n\n- From **(5)**, B + I = 64, and I = 36:\n  - B + 36 = 64\n  - B = 28\n\n- From **(1)**, B + L = 35, and B = 28:\n  - 28 + L = 35\n  - L = 7\n\n- From **(3)**, L - J = -8, and L = 7:\n  - 7 - J = -8\n  - J = 15\n\n- From **(9)**, M - J = 30, and J = 15:\n  - M - 15 = 30\n  - M = 45\n\n- From **(7)**, C + L = 31, and L = 7:\n  - C + 7 = 31\n  - C = 24\n\n- From **(8)**, G + K = 19:\n  - G + K = 19\n\n- From **(10)**, K = 3.2E:\n  - K = 3.2E\n\nNow, we need to assign the remaining numbers to D, E, F, G, and K. The remaining numbers are 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 16, and 50.\n\n- From **(2)**, J > D, and J = 15, so D must be less than 15. The possible values for D are 1, 2, 3, 5, 10.\n\n- From **(10)**, K = 3.2E, the possible pairs (E, K) from the remaining numbers are (5, 16) because 3.2 * 5 = 16.\n\n- From **(8)**, G + K = 19, and K = 16:\n  - G + 16 = 19\n  - G = 3\n\nNow, we assign the remaining numbers to D and F. The remaining numbers are 1, 2, 5, 10, and 50. Since D < 15, D can be 1, 2, 5, or 10. F can be any of the remaining numbers.\n\nLet's assign:\n- D = 10 (since it is less than 15 and fits the remaining numbers)\n- F = 1 (as it is the smallest remaining number)\n\nNow, we have:\n- A = 50 (the only number left)\n\nThus, the values for each letter are:\n- A = 50\n- B = 28\n- C = 24\n- D = 10\n- E = 5\n- F = 1\n- G = 3\n- H = 10\n- I = 36\n- J = 15\n- K = 16\n- L = 7\n- M = 45\n\nThe final answer in alphabetical order is:\n<<<[50, 28, 24, 10, 5, 1, 3, 10, 36, 15, 16, 7, 45]>>>"
