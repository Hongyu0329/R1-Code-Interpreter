    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, and 96 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and M, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **A = 3.0L**: A must be three times L. This suggests that A and L are related by a factor of 3.\n\n2. **A + M = 39**: The sum of A and M is 39.\n\n3. **L + M = 29**: The sum of L and M is 29.\n\n4. **B = 3.2L**: B is 3.2 times L.\n\n5. **A = 1.5I**: A is 1.5 times I.\n\n6. **C - B = 80**: C is 80 more than B.\n\n7. **E + K = 43**: The sum of E and K is 43.\n\n8. **C > D**: C is greater than D.\n\n9. **E = 2.4A**: E is 2.4 times A.\n\n10. **C + D = 124**: The sum of C and D is 124.\n\n11. **H - A = -12**: H is 12 less than A.\n\n12. **F + G = 47**: The sum of F and G is 47.\n\nNow, let's solve the system:\n\n- From conditions 2 and 3, we can solve for A, L, and M:\n  - A + M = 39\n  - L + M = 29\n  - Subtracting these equations gives A - L = 10, so A = L + 10.\n\n- From condition 1, A = 3L. Combining with A = L + 10, we have:\n  - 3L = L + 10\n  - 2L = 10\n  - L = 5\n  - Therefore, A = 3L = 15.\n\n- From A + M = 39, we have 15 + M = 39, so M = 24.\n\n- From condition 4, B = 3.2L = 3.2 * 5 = 16.\n\n- From condition 5, A = 1.5I, so 15 = 1.5I, giving I = 10.\n\n- From condition 6, C - B = 80, so C = B + 80 = 16 + 80 = 96.\n\n- From condition 10, C + D = 124, so 96 + D = 124, giving D = 28.\n\n- From condition 9, E = 2.4A = 2.4 * 15 = 36.\n\n- From condition 7, E + K = 43, so 36 + K = 43, giving K = 7.\n\n- From condition 11, H - A = -12, so H = A - 12 = 15 - 12 = 3.\n\n- From condition 12, F + G = 47. The remaining numbers are 2, 5, 45, and 50. The only pair that sums to 47 is 2 and 45, so F = 2 and G = 45.\n\n- The remaining number is 50, which must be J.\n\nNow, we can list the values for each letter in alphabetical order:\n\n- A = 15\n- B = 16\n- C = 96\n- D = 28\n- E = 36\n- F = 2\n- G = 45\n- H = 3\n- I = 10\n- J = 50\n- K = 7\n- L = 5\n- M = 24\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[15, 16, 96, 28, 36, 2, 45, 3, 10, 50, 7, 5, 24]>>>"
