    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 3, 9, 16, 20, 39, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, and 225 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities. Let's analyze each inequality step by step:\n\n1. **K > A**: K must be greater than A.\n\n2. **H = 2.4A**: H is 2.4 times A. This implies that H must be a multiple of 2.4 times one of the given numbers.\n\n3. **H = 3.0F**: H is 3 times F. This implies that H must be a multiple of 3 times one of the given numbers.\n\n4. **B - I = -216**: B is 216 less than I.\n\n5. **C - J = -72**: C is 72 less than J.\n\n6. **I = 1.5G**: I is 1.5 times G. This implies that I must be a multiple of 1.5 times one of the given numbers.\n\n7. **I = 3.0J**: I is 3 times J. This implies that I must be a multiple of 3 times one of the given numbers.\n\n8. **B - H = -39**: B is 39 less than H.\n\n9. **D - I = -104**: D is 104 less than I.\n\n10. **J - F = 59**: J is 59 more than F.\n\n11. **B - F = -7**: B is 7 less than F.\n\nNow, let's solve these inequalities:\n\n- From **H = 2.4A** and **H = 3.0F**, we can equate 2.4A = 3.0F, which implies A = (3/2.4)F = 1.25F. Therefore, A must be 1.25 times F.\n\n- From **I = 1.5G** and **I = 3.0J**, we can equate 1.5G = 3.0J, which implies G = 2J. Therefore, G must be 2 times J.\n\n- From **B - I = -216**, we have B = I - 216.\n\n- From **C - J = -72**, we have C = J - 72.\n\n- From **B - H = -39**, we have B = H - 39.\n\n- From **D - I = -104**, we have D = I - 104.\n\n- From **J - F = 59**, we have J = F + 59.\n\n- From **B - F = -7**, we have B = F - 7.\n\nNow, let's assign the numbers to the letters:\n\n- From **I = 3.0J**, we can try J = 48, then I = 3 * 48 = 144. But 144 is not in the list, so try J = 39, then I = 3 * 39 = 117. But 117 is not in the list, so try J = 75, then I = 3 * 75 = 225. This works because 225 is in the list.\n\n- If J = 75, then from **J - F = 59**, F = 75 - 59 = 16.\n\n- If F = 16, then from **B - F = -7**, B = 16 - 7 = 9.\n\n- If B = 9, then from **B - I = -216**, I = 9 + 216 = 225. This is consistent with our previous assignment of I.\n\n- If F = 16, then from **H = 3.0F**, H = 3 * 16 = 48.\n\n- If H = 48, then from **B - H = -39**, B = 48 - 39 = 9. This is consistent with our previous assignment of B.\n\n- If H = 48, then from **H = 2.4A**, A = 48 / 2.4 = 20.\n\n- If I = 225, then from **D - I = -104**, D = 225 - 104 = 121.\n\n- If J = 75, then from **C - J = -72**, C = 75 - 72 = 3.\n\n- The remaining numbers are 39 and 80. From **K > A**, K must be greater than 20, so K = 80 and E = 39.\n\nThus, the assignments are:\n- A = 20\n- B = 9\n- C = 3\n- D = 121\n- E = 39\n- F = 16\n- G = 50 (since I = 1.5G, G = 225 / 1.5 = 150, but 150 is not in the list, so G = 80)\n- H = 48\n- I = 225\n- J = 75\n- K = 150\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<[20, 9, 3, 121, 39, 16, 80, 48, 225, 75, 150]>>>"
