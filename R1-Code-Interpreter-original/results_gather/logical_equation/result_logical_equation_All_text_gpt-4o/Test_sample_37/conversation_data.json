    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the given numbers to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K such that all the given inequalities and equations are satisfied. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **List of numbers**: 3, 9, 16, 27, 36, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225.\n\n2. **Equations and inequalities**:\n   - I = 1.5H\n   - F = 4.0B\n   - C + E = 169\n   - E = 3.0J\n   - J - G = -11\n   - C > F\n   - I + K = 305\n   - I - D = 222\n   - J - F = -20\n   - F + H = 186\n\n3. **Step-by-step analysis**:\n\n   - From equation 1: I = 1.5H. This implies I must be 1.5 times a number in the list. The only pair that satisfies this is I = 121 and H = 80.\n   \n   - From equation 8: I - D = 222. Since I = 121, D = 121 - 222 = -101. This is not possible, so let's re-evaluate. I = 225 and H = 150 works, making D = 3.\n   \n   - From equation 7: I + K = 305. With I = 225, K = 305 - 225 = 80.\n   \n   - From equation 10: F + H = 186. With H = 150, F = 36.\n   \n   - From equation 2: F = 4.0B. With F = 36, B = 36 / 4 = 9.\n   \n   - From equation 9: J - F = -20. With F = 36, J = 16.\n   \n   - From equation 4: E = 3.0J. With J = 16, E = 48.\n   \n   - From equation 3: C + E = 169. With E = 48, C = 169 - 48 = 121.\n   \n   - From equation 5: J - G = -11. With J = 16, G = 16 + 11 = 27.\n   \n   - From equation 6: C > F. With C = 121 and F = 36, this is satisfied.\n\n4. **Assign the remaining numbers**:\n   - A = 3 (the only number left).\n\n5. **Final assignment**:\n   - A = 3\n   - B = 9\n   - C = 121\n   - D = 3\n   - E = 48\n   - F = 36\n   - G = 27\n   - H = 150\n   - I = 225\n   - J = 16\n   - K = 80\n\nThe final answer is <<<[3, 9, 121, 3, 48, 36, 27, 150, 225, 16, 80]>>>."
