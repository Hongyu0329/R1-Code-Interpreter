    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 3, 9, 16, 27, 36, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, and 225 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K based on the given system of inequalities and equations. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **F - C = -141**: This implies F = C - 141. Since F and C are both from the given set of numbers, we need to find two numbers that satisfy this equation.\n\n2. **C > D**: C must be greater than D.\n\n3. **E + K = 305**: E and K must sum to 305.\n\n4. **K = 3.0A**: K is three times A.\n\n5. **H = 3.0F**: H is three times F.\n\n6. **I + J = 157**: I and J must sum to 157.\n\n7. **K = 1.5C**: K is 1.5 times C.\n\n8. **K - A = 150**: K is 150 more than A.\n\n9. **F + G = 25**: F and G must sum to 25.\n\n10. **B + C = 153**: B and C must sum to 153.\n\nNow, let's solve these equations:\n\n- From condition 4 and 8, we have K = 3A and K = A + 150. Solving these gives A = 75 and K = 225.\n\n- From condition 7, K = 1.5C, we have 225 = 1.5C, which gives C = 150.\n\n- From condition 10, B + C = 153, we have B + 150 = 153, which gives B = 3.\n\n- From condition 1, F = C - 141, we have F = 150 - 141, which gives F = 9.\n\n- From condition 9, F + G = 25, we have 9 + G = 25, which gives G = 16.\n\n- From condition 5, H = 3F, we have H = 3 * 9, which gives H = 27.\n\n- From condition 3, E + K = 305, we have E + 225 = 305, which gives E = 80.\n\n- From condition 6, I + J = 157, we need to find two numbers from the remaining set {36, 48, 121} that sum to 157. The numbers 36 and 121 satisfy this condition, so I = 36 and J = 121.\n\n- From condition 2, C > D, we have C = 150, so D must be less than 150. The only remaining number is 48, so D = 48.\n\nNow, we have assigned all numbers to the letters:\n\n- A = 75\n- B = 3\n- C = 150\n- D = 48\n- E = 80\n- F = 9\n- G = 16\n- H = 27\n- I = 36\n- J = 121\n- K = 225\n\nThe final answer in alphabetical order is:\n\n<<<[75, 3, 150, 48, 80, 9, 16, 27, 36, 121, 225]>>>"
