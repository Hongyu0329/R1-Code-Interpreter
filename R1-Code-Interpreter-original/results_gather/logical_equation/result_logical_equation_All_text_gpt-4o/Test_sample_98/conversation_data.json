    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, and 96 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and M, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities.\n\nLet's analyze the inequalities step by step:\n\n1. **A = 2.8K**: A must be 2.8 times K. This suggests that A and K are related by a specific ratio.\n\n2. **A + F = 30**: The sum of A and F is 30.\n\n3. **C + D = 31**: The sum of C and D is 31.\n\n4. **G - L = 45**: G is 45 more than L.\n\n5. **L - C = -19**: L is 19 less than C.\n\n6. **I = 1.5K**: I is 1.5 times K.\n\n7. **A > D**: A is greater than D.\n\n8. **J + K = 13**: The sum of J and K is 13.\n\n9. **B = 3.6K**: B is 3.6 times K.\n\n10. **C = 1.6I**: C is 1.6 times I.\n\n11. **B + G = 86**: The sum of B and G is 86.\n\n12. **K - J = 7**: K is 7 more than J.\n\nNow, let's solve these step by step:\n\n- From inequalities 8 and 12, we have J + K = 13 and K - J = 7. Solving these, we get:\n  - K = 10\n  - J = 3\n\n- From inequality 1, A = 2.8K, and since K = 10, A = 28.\n\n- From inequality 2, A + F = 30, and A = 28, so F = 2.\n\n- From inequality 6, I = 1.5K, and K = 10, so I = 15.\n\n- From inequality 9, B = 3.6K, and K = 10, so B = 36.\n\n- From inequality 11, B + G = 86, and B = 36, so G = 50.\n\n- From inequality 4, G - L = 45, and G = 50, so L = 5.\n\n- From inequality 5, L - C = -19, and L = 5, so C = 24.\n\n- From inequality 3, C + D = 31, and C = 24, so D = 7.\n\n- From inequality 10, C = 1.6I, and I = 15, so C = 24, which is consistent.\n\nNow, we have assigned values to A, B, C, D, F, G, I, J, K, and L. The remaining letters are E, H, and M. The remaining numbers are 16, 45, and 96.\n\n- Since E, H, and M are not directly involved in any inequalities, we can assign the remaining numbers to them. Let's assign:\n  - E = 16\n  - H = 45\n  - M = 96\n\nThus, the values for each letter in alphabetical order are:\n\nA = 28, B = 36, C = 24, D = 7, E = 16, F = 2, G = 50, H = 45, I = 15, J = 3, K = 10, L = 5, M = 96.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[28, 36, 24, 7, 16, 2, 50, 45, 15, 3, 10, 5, 96]>>>"
