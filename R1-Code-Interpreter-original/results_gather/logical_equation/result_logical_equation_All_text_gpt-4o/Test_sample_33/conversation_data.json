    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of each letter based on the given inequalities and the set of possible values. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the possible values for each letter:**\n   - The possible values are: 3, 9, 16, 27, 36, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225.\n\n2. **Analyze the inequalities:**\n   - **E - F = -59:** This implies E = F + 59.\n   - **G - C = 6:** This implies G = C + 6.\n   - **H + J = 107:** This implies H and J must sum to 107.\n   - **E + I = 137:** This implies E and I must sum to 137.\n   - **B = 4.0G:** B is four times the value of G.\n   - **A + G = 234:** This implies A and G must sum to 234.\n   - **G = 3.0C:** G is three times the value of C.\n   - **E - H = -64:** This implies E = H + 64.\n   - **C - E = -13:** This implies C = E - 13.\n   - **F + K = 123:** This implies F and K must sum to 123.\n\n3. **Solve the inequalities:**\n   - From **G = 3.0C** and **G - C = 6**, we can solve for C and G:\n     - G = 3C\n     - G = C + 6\n     - Substituting G = 3C into G = C + 6 gives 3C = C + 6, so 2C = 6, thus C = 3.\n     - Therefore, G = 3 * 3 = 9.\n   - From **B = 4.0G**, we have B = 4 * 9 = 36.\n   - From **A + G = 234**, we have A + 9 = 234, so A = 225.\n   - From **C - E = -13**, we have E = C + 13 = 3 + 13 = 16.\n   - From **E - F = -59**, we have F = E + 59 = 16 + 59 = 75.\n   - From **F + K = 123**, we have K = 123 - 75 = 48.\n   - From **E + I = 137**, we have I = 137 - 16 = 121.\n   - From **E - H = -64**, we have H = E + 64 = 16 + 64 = 80.\n   - From **H + J = 107**, we have J = 107 - 80 = 27.\n\n4. **Verify the solution:**\n   - Check if all values are unique and within the given set: 3, 9, 16, 27, 36, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225.\n   - All values are unique and match the given set.\n\n5. **List the values in alphabetical order:**\n   - A = 225\n   - B = 36\n   - C = 3\n   - D = (not used, so it must be the remaining value 150)\n   - E = 16\n   - F = 75\n   - G = 9\n   - H = 80\n   - I = 121\n   - J = 27\n   - K = 48\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<[225, 36, 3, 150, 16, 75, 9, 80, 121, 27, 48]>>>"
