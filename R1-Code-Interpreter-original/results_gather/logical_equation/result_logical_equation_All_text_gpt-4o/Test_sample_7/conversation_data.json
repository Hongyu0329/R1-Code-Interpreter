    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of each letter based on the given system of inequalities and equations. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identify the possible values for each letter:**\n   - The numbers available are: 1, 3, 4, 9, 16, 27, 36, 80, 121.\n\n2. **Analyze the equations:**\n   - **Equation 1:** \\( D + H = 13 \\)\n   - **Equation 2:** \\( E - C = 15 \\)\n   - **Equation 3:** \\( C + H = 5 \\)\n   - **Equation 4:** \\( H = 4.0C \\)\n   - **Equation 5:** \\( H - B = -117 \\)\n   - **Equation 6:** \\( F = 3.0C \\)\n   - **Equation 7:** \\( F + H = 7 \\)\n\n3. **Solve the equations:**\n   - From **Equation 4**: \\( H = 4.0C \\). This implies \\( C \\) and \\( H \\) must be such that \\( H \\) is four times \\( C \\).\n   - From **Equation 3**: \\( C + H = 5 \\). Substitute \\( H = 4.0C \\) into this equation: \\( C + 4.0C = 5 \\) which simplifies to \\( 5C = 5 \\). Therefore, \\( C = 1 \\).\n   - Substitute \\( C = 1 \\) back into \\( H = 4.0C \\): \\( H = 4 \\).\n\n4. **Substitute known values into other equations:**\n   - **Equation 1:** \\( D + H = 13 \\). With \\( H = 4 \\), we have \\( D + 4 = 13 \\), so \\( D = 9 \\).\n   - **Equation 2:** \\( E - C = 15 \\). With \\( C = 1 \\), we have \\( E - 1 = 15 \\), so \\( E = 16 \\).\n   - **Equation 5:** \\( H - B = -117 \\). With \\( H = 4 \\), we have \\( 4 - B = -117 \\), so \\( B = 121 \\).\n   - **Equation 6:** \\( F = 3.0C \\). With \\( C = 1 \\), we have \\( F = 3 \\).\n   - **Equation 7:** \\( F + H = 7 \\). With \\( F = 3 \\) and \\( H = 4 \\), this equation is satisfied.\n\n5. **Determine the remaining letters:**\n   - The numbers used so far are: 1 (C), 3 (F), 4 (H), 9 (D), 16 (E), 121 (B).\n   - The remaining numbers are: 27, 36, 80.\n   - The remaining letters are: A, G, I.\n\n6. **Assign the remaining numbers to the remaining letters:**\n   - Since there are no further constraints, we can assign the remaining numbers to the remaining letters in any order. Let's assign:\n     - A = 27\n     - G = 36\n     - I = 80\n\n7. **Compile the final answer:**\n   - A = 27\n   - B = 121\n   - C = 1\n   - D = 9\n   - E = 16\n   - F = 3\n   - G = 36\n   - H = 4\n   - I = 80\n\nThe final answer, in alphabetical order, is:\n<<<[27, 121, 1, 9, 16, 3, 36, 4, 80]>>>"
