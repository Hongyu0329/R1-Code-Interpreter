    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 3, 6, 9, 20, 32, 36, 80, 120, and 121 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities. Let's analyze each inequality step by step:\n\n1. **B - I = -74**: This implies B = I - 74. Since B and I are both from the set of numbers, we need to find two numbers that satisfy this equation.\n\n2. **C + E = 140**: We need to find two numbers from the set that add up to 140.\n\n3. **A + G = 39**: We need to find two numbers from the set that add up to 39.\n\n4. **E + H = 29**: We need to find two numbers from the set that add up to 29.\n\n5. **B = 2.0A**: This implies B is twice the value of A.\n\n6. **E + I = 100**: We need to find two numbers from the set that add up to 100.\n\n7. **A + F = 124**: We need to find two numbers from the set that add up to 124.\n\n8. **A - H = -6**: This implies A = H - 6.\n\nNow, let's solve these step by step:\n\n- From inequality 5, B = 2.0A, we can deduce that A and B must be such that B is twice A. The only pair from the set that satisfies this is A = 6 and B = 12. However, 12 is not in the set, so let's try another approach. If A = 6, then B = 12, which is not possible. Let's try A = 3, then B = 6, which is possible.\n\n- With A = 3 and B = 6, check inequality 1: B - I = -74. This implies I = B + 74 = 6 + 74 = 80. So, I = 80.\n\n- From inequality 6, E + I = 100, and I = 80, we have E = 100 - 80 = 20.\n\n- From inequality 2, C + E = 140, and E = 20, we have C = 140 - 20 = 120.\n\n- From inequality 4, E + H = 29, and E = 20, we have H = 29 - 20 = 9.\n\n- From inequality 8, A - H = -6, and A = 3, we have H = A + 6 = 3 + 6 = 9, which is consistent.\n\n- From inequality 3, A + G = 39, and A = 3, we have G = 39 - 3 = 36.\n\n- From inequality 7, A + F = 124, and A = 3, we have F = 124 - 3 = 121.\n\nNow, we have assigned the numbers as follows:\n- A = 3\n- B = 6\n- C = 120\n- E = 20\n- F = 121\n- G = 36\n- H = 9\n- I = 80\n\nThe only number left is 32, which must be assigned to D.\n\nThus, the final values for each letter in alphabetical order are:\nA = 3, B = 6, C = 120, D = 32, E = 20, F = 121, G = 36, H = 9, I = 80.\n\nThe answer is: <<<[3, 6, 120, 32, 20, 121, 36, 9, 80]>>>"
