    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, 96 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M based on the given system of inequalities. Let's analyze each inequality step by step:\n\n1. **C + E = 141**: This implies that C and E must be two numbers from the list that add up to 141. The only possible pair is C = 45 and E = 96.\n\n2. **J + L = 33**: J and L must add up to 33. The only possible pair is J = 28 and L = 5.\n\n3. **K = 2.4H**: K must be 2.4 times H. From the list, K = 24 and H = 10 satisfy this condition.\n\n4. **B - J = 10**: B must be 10 more than J. Since J = 28, B = 38, but 38 is not in the list. Let's check other conditions to find a consistent solution.\n\n5. **E - C = 51**: This confirms our earlier assignment of C = 45 and E = 96.\n\n6. **C > F**: C must be greater than F. Since C = 45, F must be less than 45.\n\n7. **M = 3.2J**: M must be 3.2 times J. With J = 28, M = 89.6, but 89.6 is not in the list. Let's check other conditions to find a consistent solution.\n\n8. **E + K = 120**: E = 96 and K = 24 satisfy this condition.\n\n9. **J - H = -5**: J must be 5 less than H. With J = 28, H = 33, but 33 is not in the list. Let's check other conditions to find a consistent solution.\n\n10. **K - B = 9**: K must be 9 more than B. With K = 24, B = 15 satisfies this condition.\n\n11. **B - M = -1**: B must be 1 less than M. With B = 15, M = 16 satisfies this condition.\n\n12. **C > M**: C must be greater than M. With C = 45 and M = 16, this condition is satisfied.\n\nNow, let's assign the remaining numbers to the remaining letters:\n\n- A, D, F, G, I are left to be assigned the numbers 2, 3, 7, 36, 50.\n- Since C > F, F can be 2, 3, or 7. Let's assign F = 7.\n- A, D, G, I can be 2, 3, 36, 50. There are no further constraints, so we can assign them as follows: A = 2, D = 3, G = 36, I = 50.\n\nNow, let's list the values for each letter in alphabetical order:\n\n- A = 2\n- B = 15\n- C = 45\n- D = 3\n- E = 96\n- F = 7\n- G = 36\n- H = 10\n- I = 50\n- J = 28\n- K = 24\n- L = 5\n- M = 16\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[2, 15, 45, 3, 96, 7, 36, 10, 50, 28, 24, 5, 16]>>>"
