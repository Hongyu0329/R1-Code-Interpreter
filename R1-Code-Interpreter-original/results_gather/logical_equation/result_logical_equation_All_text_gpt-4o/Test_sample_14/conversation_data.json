    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 1, 3, 4, 9, 16, 27, 36, 80, and 121 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I based on the given system of equations. Let's analyze each equation step by step:\n\n1. **A = 3.0E**: This implies that A is three times the value of E.\n\n2. **D + F = 81**: The sum of D and F is 81.\n\n3. **A + D = 28**: The sum of A and D is 28.\n\n4. **C + F = 96**: The sum of C and F is 96.\n\n5. **A + E = 36**: The sum of A and E is 36.\n\n6. **B + E = 12**: The sum of B and E is 12.\n\n7. **B - F = -77**: B is 77 less than F.\n\nNow, let's solve these equations:\n\n- From equation 1, A = 3E.\n- From equation 5, A + E = 36. Substituting A = 3E, we get 3E + E = 36, which simplifies to 4E = 36, so E = 9. Therefore, A = 3 * 9 = 27.\n\n- From equation 6, B + E = 12. Since E = 9, B + 9 = 12, so B = 3.\n\n- From equation 7, B - F = -77. Since B = 3, 3 - F = -77, so F = 80.\n\n- From equation 2, D + F = 81. Since F = 80, D + 80 = 81, so D = 1.\n\n- From equation 3, A + D = 28. Since A = 27 and D = 1, this equation is satisfied.\n\n- From equation 4, C + F = 96. Since F = 80, C + 80 = 96, so C = 16.\n\nNow, we have determined the values for A, B, C, D, E, and F. The remaining numbers are 4, 36, and 121, which need to be assigned to G, H, and I. Since there are no constraints on G, H, and I, we can assign these numbers arbitrarily.\n\nLet's assign:\n- G = 4\n- H = 36\n- I = 121\n\nThus, the values for each letter in alphabetical order are:\nA = 27, B = 3, C = 16, D = 1, E = 9, F = 80, G = 4, H = 36, I = 121.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<[27, 3, 16, 1, 9, 80, 4, 36, 121]>>>"
