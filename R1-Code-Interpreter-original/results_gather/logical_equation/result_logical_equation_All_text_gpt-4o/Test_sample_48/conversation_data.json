    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 3, 9, 16, 20, 39, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, and 225 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities. Let's analyze each inequality step by step:\n\n1. **G + K = 23**: The possible pairs (G, K) from the given numbers that sum to 23 are (3, 20) and (20, 3). However, since 20 is not in the list, this pair is not possible. Therefore, G = 3 and K = 20.\n\n2. **I = 3.0C**: I must be three times C. The possible pairs (C, I) from the given numbers are (3, 9), (9, 27), (16, 48), and (39, 117). However, 27 and 117 are not in the list, so the only possible pair is C = 16 and I = 48.\n\n3. **D - F = 7**: The possible pairs (D, F) from the given numbers that satisfy this equation are (16, 9), (20, 13), (39, 32), (48, 41), (75, 68), and (80, 73). However, only (39, 32) is possible, but 32 is not in the list. Therefore, D = 39 and F = 32 is not possible. We need to find another pair.\n\n4. **D - B = -23**: This means B = D + 23. The possible pairs (D, B) from the given numbers are (16, 39), (20, 43), (39, 62), (48, 71), (75, 98), and (80, 103). However, only (16, 39) is possible, but 43, 62, 71, 98, and 103 are not in the list. Therefore, D = 16 and B = 39.\n\n5. **J = 2.4K**: J must be 2.4 times K. Since K = 20, J = 2.4 * 20 = 48. However, 48 is already assigned to I, so this is not possible. We need to find another pair.\n\n6. **J > B**: J must be greater than B. Since B = 39, J must be one of the numbers greater than 39, which are 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, and 225.\n\n7. **D + I = 241**: The possible pairs (D, I) from the given numbers that sum to 241 are (121, 120), (150, 91), and (225, 16). However, 120 and 91 are not in the list, so the only possible pair is D = 225 and I = 16.\n\n8. **E - G = 118**: This means E = G + 118. Since G = 3, E = 3 + 118 = 121.\n\n9. **B - K = 19**: This means B = K + 19. Since K = 20, B = 20 + 19 = 39.\n\n10. **F = 3.0G**: F must be three times G. Since G = 3, F = 3 * 3 = 9.\n\n11. **C - J = 27**: This means C = J + 27. Since C = 16, J = 16 - 27 = -11, which is not possible. We need to find another pair.\n\nAfter analyzing the inequalities and the possible values, we can assign the numbers to the letters as follows:\n\n- A = 75\n- B = 39\n- C = 16\n- D = 225\n- E = 121\n- F = 9\n- G = 3\n- H = 80\n- I = 48\n- J = 150\n- K = 20\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[75, 39, 16, 225, 121, 9, 3, 80, 48, 150, 20]>>>"
