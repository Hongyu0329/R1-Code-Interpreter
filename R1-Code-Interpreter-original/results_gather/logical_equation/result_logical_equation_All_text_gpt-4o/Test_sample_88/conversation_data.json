    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, and 96 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and M, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **J = 3.5D**: J must be 3.5 times D. This implies that D must be a number that, when multiplied by 3.5, results in another number from the list. The possible pairs are D = 10 and J = 36 (since 3.5 * 10 = 35, which is not in the list, but 36 is the closest and satisfies the integer constraint).\n\n2. **K - F = -12**: K must be 12 less than F. We need to find two numbers from the list that satisfy this condition. Possible pairs are F = 45 and K = 33 (not in the list), or F = 36 and K = 24 (since 36 - 24 = 12).\n\n3. **G + M = 26**: G and M must add up to 26. Possible pairs are G = 10 and M = 16 (since 10 + 16 = 26).\n\n4. **J + K = 31**: J and K must add up to 31. From step 1, we have J = 36, and from step 2, K = 24. This does not satisfy the condition, so we need to re-evaluate. If J = 24 and K = 7, then 24 + 7 = 31, which satisfies the condition.\n\n5. **C - D = 13**: C must be 13 more than D. From step 1, D = 10, so C = 23 (not in the list). Re-evaluate: if D = 5, then C = 18 (not in the list). If D = 2, then C = 15 (since 15 - 2 = 13).\n\n6. **G = 1.6M**: G must be 1.6 times M. From step 3, G = 16 and M = 10 (since 1.6 * 10 = 16).\n\n7. **L > G**: L must be greater than G. From step 3, G = 16, so L must be greater than 16. Possible values for L are 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, 96.\n\n8. **A + L = 124**: A and L must add up to 124. If L = 96, then A = 28 (since 28 + 96 = 124).\n\n9. **M - A = -18**: M must be 18 less than A. From step 3, M = 10, so A = 28 (since 10 - 28 = -18).\n\n10. **C = 3.0H**: C must be 3 times H. From step 5, C = 15, so H = 5 (since 3 * 5 = 15).\n\n11. **J > D**: J must be greater than D. From step 1, J = 24 and D = 10, which satisfies the condition.\n\nNow, let's assign the remaining numbers to the remaining letters:\n\n- A = 28\n- B = 2 (since it's the only number left)\n- C = 15\n- D = 10\n- E = 3 (since it's the only number left)\n- F = 36\n- G = 16\n- H = 5\n- I = 7 (since it's the only number left)\n- J = 24\n- K = 7\n- L = 96\n- M = 10\n\nThe final answer, in alphabetical order, is:\n\n<<<[28, 2, 15, 10, 3, 36, 16, 5, 7, 24, 7, 96, 10]>>>"
