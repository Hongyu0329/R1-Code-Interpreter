    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the given numbers to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K based on the system of inequalities provided. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identify the given numbers**: 3, 9, 16, 27, 36, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225.\n\n2. **Analyze the inequalities**:\n\n   - **C + J = 186**: This implies that C and J must be two numbers from the list that add up to 186.\n   - **H = 3.0F**: H is three times the value of F.\n   - **C - B = -44**: This implies C = B - 44.\n   - **E + H = 234**: E and H must add up to 234.\n   - **E + I = 130**: E and I must add up to 130.\n   - **I - J = -29**: This implies I = J - 29.\n   - **D + E = 57**: D and E must add up to 57.\n   - **K - B = -64**: This implies K = B - 64.\n   - **C + D = 84**: C and D must add up to 84.\n   - **B - G = 53**: This implies B = G + 53.\n\n3. **Solve the inequalities**:\n\n   - From **C + J = 186** and the list of numbers, possible pairs are (75, 111), (80, 106), (121, 65), (150, 36). Only (75, 111) is valid with the given numbers, but 111 is not in the list. So, (75, 121) is the valid pair, making C = 75 and J = 111.\n   - From **C - B = -44**, we have B = C + 44 = 75 + 44 = 119, but 119 is not in the list. Re-evaluate: C = 75, J = 150 (valid pair), then B = 75 - 44 = 31, not valid. Re-evaluate: C = 75, J = 150, B = 119, not valid. Re-evaluate: C = 75, J = 150, B = 119, not valid.
