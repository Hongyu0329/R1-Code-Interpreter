    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, and 96 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and M, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities. Let's analyze each inequality step by step:\n\n1. **I - J = -21**: This implies I = J - 21.\n\n2. **J - D = 14**: This implies J = D + 14.\n\n3. **K = 3.5H**: K must be 3.5 times H. This suggests that K and H must be chosen such that K is a multiple of 3.5.\n\n4. **E = 3.2C**: E must be 3.2 times C. This suggests that E and C must be chosen such that E is a multiple of 3.2.\n\n5. **J - H = 22**: This implies J = H + 22.\n\n6. **M - I = 33**: This implies M = I + 33.\n\n7. **J = 4.8C**: J must be 4.8 times C. This suggests that J and C must be chosen such that J is a multiple of 4.8.\n\n8. **E = 1.6D**: E must be 1.6 times D. This suggests that E and D must be chosen such that E is a multiple of 1.6.\n\n9. **I - L = -12**: This implies I = L - 12.\n\n10. **M = 2.4L**: M must be 2.4 times L. This suggests that M and L must be chosen such that M is a multiple of 2.4.\n\n11. **C - E = -11**: This implies C = E - 11.\n\nNow, let's solve these equations step by step:\n\n- From equation 7, J = 4.8C. The possible values for C that satisfy this are limited by the available numbers. Let's try C = 5, then J = 4.8 * 5 = 24. This is a valid number from the list.\n\n- With C = 5 and J = 24, from equation 4, E = 3.2 * 5 = 16. This is also a valid number.\n\n- From equation 2, J = D + 14, so D = J - 14 = 24 - 14 = 10. This is a valid number.\n\n- From equation 8, E = 1.6D, so 16 = 1.6 * 10, which is consistent.\n\n- From equation 5, J = H + 22, so H = J - 22 = 24 - 22 = 2. This is a valid number.\n\n- From equation 3, K = 3.5H, so K = 3.5 * 2 = 7. This is a valid number.\n\n- From equation 1, I = J - 21, so I = 24 - 21 = 3. This is a valid number.\n\n- From equation 6, M = I + 33, so M = 3 + 33 = 36. This is a valid number.\n\n- From equation 9, I = L - 12, so L = I + 12 = 3 + 12 = 15. This is a valid number.\n\n- From equation 10, M = 2.4L, so 36 = 2.4 * 15, which is consistent.\n\nNow, we have assigned values to C, D, E, H, I, J, K, L, and M. The remaining numbers are 28, 45, 50, and 96, which need to be assigned to A, B, F, and G.\n\n- Assign A = 28, B = 45, F = 50, G = 96.\n\nThus, the values for each letter in alphabetical order are:\n\nA = 28, B = 45, C = 5, D = 10, E = 16, F = 50, G = 96, H = 2, I = 3, J = 24, K = 7, L = 15, M = 36.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[28, 45, 5, 10, 16, 50, 96, 2, 3, 24, 7, 15, 36]>>>"
