    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of each letter based on the given system of inequalities and the set of possible values. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identify the possible values for each letter:**\n   - The possible values are: 3, 9, 16, 20, 39, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225.\n\n2. **Analyze the inequalities:**\n   - **F - K = 36:** This means F is 36 more than K.\n   - **B - K = 111:** This means B is 111 more than K.\n   - **B + E = 230:** The sum of B and E is 230.\n   - **H + J = 25:** The sum of H and J is 25.\n   - **E - A = 77:** E is 77 more than A.\n   - **H + I = 36:** The sum of H and I is 36.\n   - **C + E = 305:** The sum of C and E is 305.\n   - **C - I = 205:** C is 205 more than I.\n   - **C + J = 234:** The sum of C and J is 234.\n   - **G = 3.0H:** G is three times H.\n   - **A + K = 42:** The sum of A and K is 42.\n\n3. **Solve the inequalities step by step:**\n\n   - From **A + K = 42**, we can express A as A = 42 - K.\n   - From **B - K = 111**, we can express B as B = K + 111.\n   - From **F - K = 36**, we can express F as F = K + 36.\n   - From **E - A = 77**, we can express E as E = A + 77 = 42 - K + 77 = 119 - K.\n   - From **B + E = 230**, substitute B and E: (K + 111) + (119 - K) = 230, which simplifies to 230 = 230, confirming consistency.\n   - From **C + E = 305**, substitute E: C + (119 - K) = 305, so C = 186 + K.\n   - From **C - I = 205**, substitute C: (186 + K) - I = 205, so I = (186 + K) - 205 = K - 19.\n   - From **H + I = 36**, substitute I: H + (K - 19) = 36, so H = 55 - K.\n   - From **H + J = 25**, substitute H: (55 - K) + J = 25, so J = K - 30.\n   - From **C + J = 234**, substitute C and J: (186 + K) + (K - 30) = 234, which simplifies to 2K + 156 = 234, so 2K = 78, and K = 39.\n   - Substitute K = 39 into the equations:\n     - A = 42 - 39 = 3\n     - B = 39 + 111 = 150\n     - F = 39 + 36 = 75\n     - E = 119 - 39 = 80\n     - C = 186 + 39 = 225\n     - I = 39 - 19 = 20\n     - H = 55 - 39 = 16\n     - J = 39 - 30 = 9\n     - G = 3 * 16 = 48\n\n4. **Verify the solution:**\n   - Check all inequalities with the found values:\n     - F - K = 75 - 39 = 36 (True)\n     - B - K = 150 - 39 = 111 (True)\n     - B + E = 150 + 80 = 230 (True)\n     - H + J = 16 + 9 = 25 (True)\n     - E - A = 80 - 3 = 77 (True)\n     - H + I = 16 + 20 = 36 (True)\n     - C + E = 225 + 80 = 305 (True)\n     - C - I = 225 - 20 = 205 (True)\n     - C + J = 225 + 9 = 234 (True)\n     - G = 3 * H = 3 * 16 = 48 (True)\n     - A + K = 3 + 39 = 42 (True)\n\nThe values satisfy all the inequalities, so the solution is correct.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<[3, 150, 225, 48, 80, 75, 48, 16, 20, 9, 39]>>>"
