    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, and 50 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and M, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **M = 2.4L**: This implies that M is 2.4 times L. The possible values for L and M that satisfy this condition from the given numbers are L = 10 and M = 24, because 2.4 * 10 = 24.\n\n2. **F = 3.0L**: With L = 10, F must be 3 * 10 = 30. However, 30 is not in the list of available numbers. Therefore, let's reconsider L. If L = 15, then F = 3 * 15 = 45, which is in the list. So, L = 15 and F = 45.\n\n3. **E + I = 8**: The possible pairs (E, I) from the list that sum to 8 are (1, 7) and (7, 1). We will determine which is correct later.\n\n4. **K - H = -8**: This implies K = H - 8. We will use this later.\n\n5. **H > I**: This condition will help us determine the correct pair for E and I. If I = 1, then H must be greater than 1. If I = 7, then H must be greater than 7.\n\n6. **L + M = 51**: With L = 15 and M = 36, this condition is satisfied.\n\n7. **C + J = 9**: The possible pairs (C, J) from the list that sum to 9 are (1, 8) and (3, 6). We will determine which is correct later.\n\n8. **G = 2.0I**: If I = 1, then G = 2 * 1 = 2, which is in the list. If I = 7, then G = 2 * 7 = 14, which is not in the list. Therefore, I = 1 and G = 2.\n\n9. **A - D = 49**: This implies A = D + 49. The only possible values for A and D that satisfy this condition are A = 50 and D = 1.\n\n10. **H = 1.5K**: This implies H is 1.5 times K. The possible values for H and K that satisfy this condition are H = 24 and K = 16, because 1.5 * 16 = 24.\n\nNow, let's assign the remaining numbers:\n\n- From condition 3, since I = 1, E must be 7.\n- From condition 7, since C + J = 9 and the remaining numbers are 3 and 5, C = 3 and J = 6.\n\nFinally, let's list the values for each letter in alphabetical order:\n\n- A = 50\n- B = 5 (the only remaining number)\n- C = 3\n- D = 1\n- E = 7\n- F = 45\n- G = 2\n- H = 24\n- I = 1\n- J = 6\n- K = 16\n- L = 15\n- M = 36\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[50, 5, 3, 1, 7, 45, 2, 24, 1, 6, 16, 15, 36]>>>"
