    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, 96 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M based on the given system of inequalities and equations. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **A - C = 26**: This implies A is 26 units greater than C.\n\n2. **M > L**: M is greater than L.\n\n3. **C = 2.0D**: C is twice the value of D.\n\n4. **E + I = 57**: The sum of E and I is 57.\n\n5. **L = 1.6C**: L is 1.6 times the value of C.\n\n6. **G - K = -12**: G is 12 units less than K.\n\n7. **K = 1.5C**: K is 1.5 times the value of C.\n\n8. **A = 3.6C**: A is 3.6 times the value of C.\n\n9. **M = 4.8D**: M is 4.8 times the value of D.\n\n10. **C + F = 106**: The sum of C and F is 106.\n\n11. **H - G = 42**: H is 42 units greater than G.\n\nNow, let's solve these equations:\n\n- From **C = 2.0D** and **M = 4.8D**, we can express M in terms of C:  \n  \\( M = 2.4C \\).\n\n- From **A = 3.6C**, we can express A in terms of C.\n\n- From **K = 1.5C**, we can express K in terms of C.\n\n- From **L = 1.6C**, we can express L in terms of C.\n\n- From **A - C = 26**, we have \\( 3.6C - C = 26 \\), which simplifies to \\( 2.6C = 26 \\).  \n  Solving for C gives \\( C = 10 \\).\n\n- Using \\( C = 10 \\), we find:\n  - \\( A = 3.6 \\times 10 = 36 \\)\n  - \\( D = \\frac{C}{2} = 5 \\)\n  - \\( M = 4.8 \\times 5 = 24 \\)\n  - \\( K = 1.5 \\times 10 = 15 \\)\n  - \\( L = 1.6 \\times 10 = 16 \\)\n\n- From **M > L**, we have \\( 24 > 16 \\), which is satisfied.\n\n- From **C + F = 106**, we have \\( 10 + F = 106 \\), so \\( F = 96 \\).\n\n- From **G - K = -12**, we have \\( G = K - 12 = 15 - 12 = 3 \\).\n\n- From **H - G = 42**, we have \\( H = G + 42 = 3 + 42 = 45 \\).\n\n- From **E + I = 57**, we need to find E and I such that their sum is 57. The remaining numbers are 2, 7, 28, 50. The only combination that sums to 57 is E = 7 and I = 50.\n\n- The remaining numbers are 2 and 28, which must be assigned to B and J. Since there are no constraints on B and J, we can assign B = 2 and J = 28.\n\nThus, the values for each letter are:\n- A = 36\n- B = 2\n- C = 10\n- D = 5\n- E = 7\n- F = 96\n- G = 3\n- H = 45\n- I = 50\n- J = 28\n- K = 15\n- L = 16\n- M = 24\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<[36, 2, 10, 5, 7, 96, 3, 45, 50, 28, 15, 16, 24]>>>"
