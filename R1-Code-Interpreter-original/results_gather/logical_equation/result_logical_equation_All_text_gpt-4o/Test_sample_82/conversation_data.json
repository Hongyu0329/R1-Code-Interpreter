    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, and 96 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and M, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities. Let's analyze each inequality step by step:\n\n1. **C - E = -21**: This implies that E = C + 21.\n\n2. **J = 4.0C**: J is four times the value of C.\n\n3. **H + K = 23**: The sum of H and K is 23.\n\n4. **D + L = 17**: The sum of D and L is 17.\n\n5. **C - A = -26**: This implies that A = C + 26.\n\n6. **G + M = 8**: The sum of G and M is 8.\n\n7. **F + G = 13**: The sum of F and G is 13.\n\n8. **H - G = 4**: This implies that H = G + 4.\n\n9. **A - C = 26**: This is the same as inequality 5, confirming A = C + 26.\n\n10. **I - J = -68**: This implies that I = J - 68.\n\n11. **F + M = 15**: The sum of F and M is 15.\n\nNow, let's solve these equations step by step:\n\n- From inequalities 5 and 9, we have A = C + 26.\n- From inequality 1, E = C + 21.\n- From inequality 2, J = 4C.\n- From inequality 10, I = 4C - 68.\n- From inequality 8, H = G + 4.\n- From inequality 3, H + K = 23, so K = 23 - H = 23 - (G + 4) = 19 - G.\n- From inequality 6, G + M = 8, so M = 8 - G.\n- From inequality 11, F + M = 15, so F = 15 - M = 15 - (8 - G) = 7 + G.\n\nNow, let's assign the numbers to the letters:\n\n- C must be a number such that 4C is also in the list. The only possibility is C = 10, J = 40 (but 40 is not in the list, so let's try another approach).\n- Let's try C = 5, then J = 20 (not in the list).\n- Let's try C = 7, then J = 28 (28 is in the list).\n\nNow, let's assign the numbers:\n\n- C = 7, J = 28.\n- A = C + 26 = 7 + 26 = 33 (not in the list, so let's try another approach).\n- Let's try C = 5, then J = 20 (not in the list).\n- Let's try C = 10, then J = 40 (not in the list).\n- Let's try C = 24, then J = 96 (96 is in the list).\n\nNow, let's assign the numbers:\n\n- C = 24, J = 96.\n- A = C + 26 = 24 + 26 = 50.\n- E = C + 21 = 24 + 21 = 45.\n- I = J - 68 = 96 - 68 = 28.\n- G + M = 8, and F + M = 15, so G = 2, M = 6, F = 13 (not in the list, so let's try another approach).\n- G = 2, M = 6, F = 15 - 6 = 9 (not in the list, so let's try another approach).\n- G = 3, M = 5, F = 15 - 5 = 10.\n- H = G + 4 = 3 + 4 = 7.\n- K = 19 - G = 19 - 3 = 16.\n- D + L = 17, so D = 2, L = 15.\n\nNow, let's assign the numbers:\n\n- A = 50\n- B = 3\n- C = 24\n- D = 2\n- E = 45\n- F = 10\n- G = 3\n- H = 7\n- I = 28\n- J = 96\n- K = 16\n- L = 15\n- M = 5\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[50, 3, 24, 2, 45, 10, 3, 7, 28, 96, 16, 15, 5]>>>"
