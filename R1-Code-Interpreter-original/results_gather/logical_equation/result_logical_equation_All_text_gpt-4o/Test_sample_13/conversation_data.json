    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 1, 3, 4, 9, 16, 27, 36, 80, and 121 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I based on the given system of inequalities and equations. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **A + E = 107**: This means A and E must be two numbers from the set that add up to 107. The possible pairs are (27, 80) and (80, 27).\n\n2. **D + H = 137**: This means D and H must be two numbers from the set that add up to 137. The possible pair is (16, 121) and (121, 16).\n\n3. **H > C**: This means the number assigned to H must be greater than the number assigned to C.\n\n4. **A + B = 63**: This means A and B must be two numbers from the set that add up to 63. The possible pairs are (27, 36) and (36, 27).\n\n5. **E - F = 79**: This means E and F must be two numbers from the set such that E is 79 more than F. The possible pair is (80, 1).\n\n6. **B + E = 116**: This means B and E must be two numbers from the set that add up to 116. The possible pair is (36, 80).\n\n7. **B - D = -85**: This means B and D must be two numbers from the set such that D is 85 more than B. The possible pair is (36, 121).\n\nNow, let's use these conditions to find the values for each letter:\n\n- From condition 5, E = 80 and F = 1.\n- From condition 1, A + E = 107, and since E = 80, A = 27.\n- From condition 4, A + B = 63, and since A = 27, B = 36.\n- From condition 6, B + E = 116, and since B = 36 and E = 80, this condition is satisfied.\n- From condition 7, B - D = -85, and since B = 36, D = 121.\n- From condition 2, D + H = 137, and since D = 121, H = 16.\n- From condition 3, H > C, and since H = 16, C must be less than 16. The possible values for C are 3, 4, and 9. Since 1 is already used for F, C can be 3, 4, or 9.\n- The remaining numbers are 3, 4, 9, and 36. Since B = 36, the remaining numbers are 3, 4, and 9.\n- Since H = 16, C must be less than 16, so C can be 3, 4, or 9. Let's assign C = 9.\n- The remaining numbers are 3 and 4, which can be assigned to G and I. Let's assign G = 4 and I = 3.\n\nThus, the values for each letter are:\n- A = 27\n- B = 36\n- C = 9\n- D = 121\n- E = 80\n- F = 1\n- G = 4\n- H = 16\n- I = 3\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<[27, 36, 9, 121, 80, 1, 4, 16, 3]>>>"
