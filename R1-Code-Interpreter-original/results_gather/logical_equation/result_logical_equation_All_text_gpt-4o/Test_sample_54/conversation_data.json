    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 3, 9, 16, 20, 39, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, and 225 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities and equations. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **H > G**: This means the number assigned to H must be greater than the number assigned to G.\n\n2. **H + K = 273**: The sum of the numbers assigned to H and K must be 273.\n\n3. **B - F = 60**: The number assigned to B minus the number assigned to F must equal 60.\n\n4. **K - B = 145**: The number assigned to K minus the number assigned to B must equal 145.\n\n5. **F - I = 11**: The number assigned to F minus the number assigned to I must equal 11.\n\n6. **D - E = -59**: The number assigned to D minus the number assigned to E must equal -59, meaning E is greater than D.\n\n7. **B = 4.0F**: The number assigned to B is four times the number assigned to F.\n\n8. **G + H = 51**: The sum of the numbers assigned to G and H must be 51.\n\n9. **K = 3.0E**: The number assigned to K is three times the number assigned to E.\n\n10. **C + K = 264**: The sum of the numbers assigned to C and K must be 264.\n\n11. **I = 3.0G**: The number assigned to I is three times the number assigned to G.\n\nNow, let's solve these equations step by step:\n\n- From equation 7, B = 4F. From equation 3, B - F = 60. Substituting B = 4F into B - F = 60 gives 4F - F = 60, so 3F = 60, which means F = 20. Therefore, B = 80.\n\n- From equation 4, K - B = 145. We know B = 80, so K = 80 + 145 = 225.\n\n- From equation 9, K = 3E. We know K = 225, so 3E = 225, which means E = 75.\n\n- From equation 6, D - E = -59. We know E = 75, so D = 75 - 59 = 16.\n\n- From equation 5, F - I = 11. We know F = 20, so 20 - I = 11, which means I = 9.\n\n- From equation 11, I = 3G. We know I = 9, so 3G = 9, which means G = 3.\n\n- From equation 8, G + H = 51. We know G = 3, so 3 + H = 51, which means H = 48.\n\n- From equation 2, H + K = 273. We know H = 48 and K = 225, and 48 + 225 = 273, which satisfies the equation.\n\n- From equation 10, C + K = 264. We know K = 225, so C + 225 = 264, which means C = 39.\n\nNow, we have assigned numbers to all letters except A and J. The remaining numbers are 121 and 150. Since there are no conditions involving A and J, we can assign these numbers arbitrarily. Let's assign A = 121 and J = 150.\n\nThus, the values for each letter in alphabetical order are:\n\nA = 121, B = 80, C = 39, D = 16, E = 75, F = 20, G = 3, H = 48, I = 9, J = 150, K = 225.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[121, 80, 39, 16, 75, 20, 3, 48, 9, 150, 225]>>>"
