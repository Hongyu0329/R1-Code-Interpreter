    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 3, 9, 16, 20, 39, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, and 225 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **I = 4.0C**: This implies that I is four times the value of C. The possible pairs (C, I) from the given numbers are (3, 12), (9, 36), (16, 64), (20, 80), and (39, 156). However, only (20, 80) fits within the given numbers.\n\n2. **F + I = 83**: With I = 80, F must be 3.\n\n3. **K - E = 82**: The possible pairs (E, K) are (39, 121) and (48, 130). However, only (48, 130) fits within the given numbers, but 130 is not in the list. So, (39, 121) is the correct pair.\n\n4. **E + F = 42**: With E = 39, F must be 3, which is consistent with our previous finding.\n\n5. **A + H = 225**: The possible pairs (A, H) are (75, 150) and (150, 75). However, A > H, so A = 150 and H = 75.\n\n6. **B + K = 130**: With K = 121, B must be 9.\n\n7. **A > B**: With A = 150 and B = 9, this condition is satisfied.\n\n8. **J = 3.0H**: With H = 75, J must be 225.\n\n9. **B = 3.0F**: With F = 3, B must be 9, which is consistent with our previous finding.\n\n10. **C + F = 23**: With F = 3, C must be 20.\n\n11. **A > K**: With A = 150 and K = 121, this condition is satisfied.\n\nNow, let's assign the remaining numbers to the letters:\n\n- D and G are left, and the remaining numbers are 16 and 48. There are no specific conditions for D and G, so we can assign them as D = 16 and G = 48.\n\nFinally, the values for each letter in alphabetical order are:\n\n- A = 150\n- B = 9\n- C = 20\n- D = 16\n- E = 39\n- F = 3\n- G = 48\n- H = 75\n- I = 80\n- J = 225\n- K = 121\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<[150, 9, 20, 16, 39, 3, 48, 75, 80, 225, 121]>>>"
