    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of each letter based on the given inequalities and the set of possible values. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **Identify the possible values for each letter:**\n   - The possible values are: 3, 9, 16, 27, 36, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225.\n\n2. **Analyze the inequalities:**\n\n   - **D - A = 11:** This means D is 11 more than A.\n   - **H + I = 228:** The sum of H and I is 228.\n   - **G = 4.0B:** G is four times B.\n   - **I - F = -118:** I is 118 less than F.\n   - **H - B = 216:** H is 216 more than B.\n   - **A + G = 52:** The sum of A and G is 52.\n   - **F + G = 157:** The sum of F and G is 157.\n   - **E = 3.0A:** E is three times A.\n   - **G + I = 39:** The sum of G and I is 39.\n   - **C - H = -75:** C is 75 less than H.\n\n3. **Solve the inequalities step by step:**\n\n   - From **G = 4.0B**, the possible pairs (B, G) are (9, 36) because 36 is the only number in the list that is four times another number in the list (9).\n\n   - From **H - B = 216**, since B = 9, H = 9 + 216 = 225.\n\n   - From **C - H = -75**, C = H - 75 = 225 - 75 = 150.\n\n   - From **H + I = 228**, I = 228 - H = 228 - 225 = 3.\n\n   - From **I - F = -118**, F = I + 118 = 3 + 118 = 121.\n\n   - From **F + G = 157**, G = 157 - F = 157 - 121 = 36. This is consistent with G = 36 from the pair (B, G).\n\n   - From **A + G = 52**, A = 52 - G = 52 - 36 = 16.\n\n   - From **D - A = 11**, D = A + 11 = 16 + 11 = 27.\n\n   - From **E = 3.0A**, E = 3 * A = 3 * 16 = 48.\n\n4. **Verify all values are used and consistent:**\n\n   - The values used are: A = 16, B = 9, C = 150, D = 27, E = 48, F = 121, G = 36, H = 225, I = 3.\n   - The remaining values are J = 75 and K = 80, which are not constrained by any inequalities, so they can be assigned arbitrarily.\n\n5. **Assign the remaining values:**\n\n   - Assign J = 75 and K = 80.\n\n6. **List the values in alphabetical order:**\n\n   - A = 16\n   - B = 9\n   - C = 150\n   - D = 27\n   - E = 48\n   - F = 121\n   - G = 36\n   - H = 225\n   - I = 3\n   - J = 75\n   - K = 80\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[16, 9, 150, 27, 48, 121, 36, 225, 3, 75, 80]>>>"
