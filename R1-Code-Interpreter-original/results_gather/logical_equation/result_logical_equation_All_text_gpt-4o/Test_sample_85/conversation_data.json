    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, and 96 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and M, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities. Let's analyze each inequality step by step:\n\n1. **E > C**: E must be greater than C.\n\n2. **G = 4.8M**: G is 4.8 times M. This suggests that G and M must be chosen such that G is a multiple of 4.8.\n\n3. **L - C = 12**: L is 12 more than C.\n\n4. **D + H = 66**: The sum of D and H is 66.\n\n5. **L - D = -35**: L is 35 less than D.\n\n6. **E = 3.6B**: E is 3.6 times B. This suggests that E and B must be chosen such that E is a multiple of 3.6.\n\n7. **B - D = -40**: B is 40 less than D.\n\n8. **H - G = -8**: H is 8 more than G.\n\n9. **C = 1.5K**: C is 1.5 times K. This suggests that C and K must be chosen such that C is a multiple of 1.5.\n\n10. **H = 1.6B**: H is 1.6 times B. This suggests that H and B must be chosen such that H is a multiple of 1.6.\n\n11. **J - E = 9**: J is 9 more than E.\n\nNow, let's solve the inequalities:\n\n- From inequality 5, L = D - 35. Substitute this into inequality 3: D - 35 - C = 12, so D - C = 47.\n\n- From inequality 7, B = D - 40. Substitute this into inequality 6: E = 3.6(D - 40) = 3.6D - 144.\n\n- From inequality 10, H = 1.6B = 1.6(D - 40) = 1.6D - 64.\n\n- From inequality 4, D + H = 66, substitute H: D + (1.6D - 64) = 66, so 2.6D = 130, and D = 50.\n\n- Substitute D = 50 into B = D - 40: B = 10.\n\n- Substitute D = 50 into L = D - 35: L = 15.\n\n- Substitute D = 50 into H = 1.6D - 64: H = 16.\n\n- Substitute D = 50 into E = 3.6D - 144: E = 36.\n\n- From inequality 11, J = E + 9 = 36 + 9 = 45.\n\n- From inequality 9, C = 1.5K. Since C must be a number from the list, and 1.5K must also be a number from the list, we find that C = 24 and K = 16.\n\n- From inequality 3, L - C = 12, substitute L = 15: 15 - C = 12, so C = 3. This contradicts our previous finding, so we need to re-evaluate.\n\n- Re-evaluate: C = 24, L = 36 (since L - C = 12).\n\n- From inequality 2, G = 4.8M. Since G must be a number from the list, and 4.8M must also be a number from the list, we find that G = 24 and M = 5.\n\n- From inequality 8, H - G = -8, substitute H = 16: 16 - G = -8, so G = 24.\n\n- Finally, assign the remaining numbers to A, F, and I. The remaining numbers are 2, 7, and 28. Assign them as follows: A = 2, F = 7, I = 28.\n\nThe final assignment of numbers to letters is:\n\n- A = 2\n- B = 10\n- C = 24\n- D = 50\n- E = 36\n- F = 7\n- G = 24\n- H = 16\n- I = 28\n- J = 45\n- K = 16\n- L = 15\n- M = 5\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<[2, 10, 24, 50, 36, 7, 24, 16, 28, 45, 16, 15, 5]>>>"
