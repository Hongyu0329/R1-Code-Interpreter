    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 3, 6, 9, 20, 32, 36, 80, 120, and 121 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities. Let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **H = 1.6G**: This implies that H is 1.6 times G. The possible pairs (G, H) from the given numbers that satisfy this are (80, 128) and (120, 192). However, 128 and 192 are not in the list, so this condition is not directly usable with the given numbers.\n\n2. **F + I = 9**: The possible pairs (F, I) that sum to 9 are (3, 6) and (6, 3). However, F = 2.0I (from condition 6), which means F must be twice I. The only pair that satisfies both conditions is (6, 3).\n\n3. **D = 2.5H**: This implies D is 2.5 times H. The possible pairs (H, D) from the given numbers that satisfy this are (32, 80). \n\n4. **B + D = 201**: Given D = 80, B must be 121 to satisfy this equation.\n\n5. **I - D = -77**: Given I = 3, D must be 80 to satisfy this equation.\n\n6. **F = 2.0I**: We already determined F = 6 and I = 3, which satisfies this condition.\n\n7. **C + D = 89**: Given D = 80, C must be 9 to satisfy this equation.\n\n8. **E + I = 39**: Given I = 3, E must be 36 to satisfy this equation.\n\nNow, let's assign the remaining numbers to the letters:\n\n- A: The only number left is 20.\n- B: We determined B = 121.\n- C: We determined C = 9.\n- D: We determined D = 80.\n- E: We determined E = 36.\n- F: We determined F = 6.\n- G: The only number left is 120.\n- H: We determined H = 32.\n- I: We determined I = 3.\n\nThus, the values for each letter in alphabetical order are:\n\n<<<[20, 121, 9, 80, 36, 6, 120, 32, 3]>>>"
