    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 1, 3, 4, 9, 16, 27, 36, 80, and 121 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I based on the given inequalities and equations. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **C = 3.0B**: This means C is three times B. The possible pairs (B, C) from the given numbers are (3, 9).\n\n2. **A = 4.0C**: A is four times C. If C = 9, then A = 36.\n\n3. **F > A**: F must be greater than A. If A = 36, then F can be 80 or 121.\n\n4. **D = 4.0H**: D is four times H. The possible pairs (H, D) from the given numbers are (4, 16).\n\n5. **E > B**: E must be greater than B. If B = 3, then E can be 4, 9, 16, 27, 36, 80, or 121. However, since C = 9 and D = 16, E can be 27, 80, or 121.\n\n6. **A - H = 32**: A minus H equals 32. If A = 36, then H = 4.\n\n7. **F + H = 84**: F plus H equals 84. If H = 4, then F = 80.\n\nNow, let's assign the numbers to the letters based on the above analysis:\n\n- **A = 36** (from A = 4.0C and C = 9)\n- **B = 3** (from C = 3.0B)\n- **C = 9** (from C = 3.0B)\n- **D = 16** (from D = 4.0H and H = 4)\n- **E = 27** (E > B and E is not 9 or 16)\n- **F = 80** (from F + H = 84 and F > A)\n- **G = 1** (the only number left)\n- **H = 4** (from A - H = 32)\n- **I = 121** (the only number left)\n\nThus, the values for the letters in alphabetical order are:\n\n<<<[36, 3, 9, 16, 27, 80, 1, 4, 121]>>>"
