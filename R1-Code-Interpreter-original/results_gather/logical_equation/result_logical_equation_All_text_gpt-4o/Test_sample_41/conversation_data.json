    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of each letter based on the given system of inequalities and the set of possible values. Let's analyze the constraints step by step:\n\n1. **C = 3.0J**: This implies that C is three times the value of J.\n\n2. **F + K = 375**: The sum of F and K is 375.\n\n3. **H = 3.0D**: H is three times the value of D.\n\n4. **D + F = 234**: The sum of D and F is 234.\n\n5. **J - B = -59**: J is 59 less than B.\n\n6. **J + K = 166**: The sum of J and K is 166.\n\n7. **B - H = 48**: B is 48 more than H.\n\n8. **K - C = 102**: K is 102 more than C.\n\n9. **C + K = 198**: The sum of C and K is 198.\n\n10. **D - B = -66**: D is 66 less than B.\n\nNow, let's solve these equations step by step:\n\n- From equation 9, **C + K = 198**, we can express K as **K = 198 - C**.\n\n- From equation 8, **K - C = 102**, we can express K as **K = C + 102**.\n\n- Equating the two expressions for K, we have:\n  \\[\n  198 - C = C + 102\n  \\]\n  Solving for C, we get:\n  \\[\n  198 - 102 = 2C \\implies 96 = 2C \\implies C = 48\n  \\]\n\n- With C = 48, substitute back to find K:\n  \\[\n  K = 198 - C = 198 - 48 = 150\n  \\]\n\n- From equation 1, **C = 3.0J**, we have:\n  \\[\n  48 = 3J \\implies J = 16\n  \\]\n\n- From equation 6, **J + K = 166**, we have:\n  \\[\n  16 + K = 166 \\implies K = 150\n  \\]\n  (This confirms our previous calculation for K.)\n\n- From equation 5, **J - B = -59**, we have:\n  \\[\n  16 - B = -59 \\implies B = 75\n  \\]\n\n- From equation 10, **D - B = -66**, we have:\n  \\[\n  D - 75 = -66 \\implies D = 9\n  \\]\n\n- From equation 3, **H = 3.0D**, we have:\n  \\[\n  H = 3 \\times 9 = 27\n  \\]\n\n- From equation 7, **B - H = 48**, we have:\n  \\[\n  75 - H = 48 \\implies H = 27\n  \\]\n  (This confirms our previous calculation for H.)\n\n- From equation 4, **D + F = 234**, we have:\n  \\[\n  9 + F = 234 \\implies F = 225\n  \\]\n\n- From equation 2, **F + K = 375**, we have:\n  \\[\n  225 + 150 = 375\n  \\]\n  (This confirms our previous calculation for F and K.)\n\nNow, we have determined the values for B, C, D, F, H, J, and K. The remaining letters A, E, G, and I must be assigned the remaining numbers 3, 36, 80, and 121, respectively, as they do not appear in any of the equations.\n\nThus, the values for each letter in alphabetical order are:\n\n- A = 3\n- B = 75\n- C = 48\n- D = 9\n- E = 36\n- F = 225\n- G = 80\n- H = 27\n- I = 121\n- J = 16\n- K = 150\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<[3, 75, 48, 9, 36, 225, 80, 27, 121, 16, 150]>>>"
