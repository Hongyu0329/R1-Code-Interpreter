    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 3, 9, 16, 27, 36, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, and 225 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K based on the given system of inequalities. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **H + J = 130**: The possible pairs of numbers that sum to 130 are (80, 50) and (121, 9). However, 50 is not in our list, so the only valid pair is (80, 50). Thus, H = 80 and J = 50.\n\n2. **C + I = 177**: The possible pairs that sum to 177 are (75, 102) and (121, 56). However, 102 and 56 are not in our list, so we need to find another pair. The correct pair is (75, 102), but since 102 is not in the list, we need to check other constraints to find the correct values.\n\n3. **C + G = 75**: This implies C = 75 - G. We will use this in conjunction with other constraints.\n\n4. **G = 3.0F**: This implies G is three times F. We will use this to find G and F.\n\n5. **B - E = 150**: This implies B = E + 150. We will use this to find B and E.\n\n6. **J - C = -18**: Since J = 50, this implies C = 50 + 18 = 68. However, 68 is not in our list, so we need to check other constraints.\n\n7. **E + G = 123**: This implies G = 123 - E. We will use this to find G and E.\n\n8. **D + F = 96**: This implies D = 96 - F. We will use this to find D and F.\n\n9. **E + K = 78**: This implies K = 78 - E. We will use this to find K and E.\n\n10. **H + K = 124**: Since H = 80, this implies K = 124 - 80 = 44. However, 44 is not in our list, so we need to check other constraints.\n\nNow, let's solve the system:\n\n- From G = 3.0F, we have G = 3F. The possible values for F are 16, and 48, which gives G = 48 and 144, respectively. Since 144 is not in our list, F = 16 and G = 48.\n\n- From E + G = 123, we have E = 123 - 48 = 75.\n\n- From B - E = 150, we have B = 75 + 150 = 225.\n\n- From E + K = 78, we have K = 78 - 75 = 3.\n\n- From H + J = 130, we have H = 80 and J = 50.\n\n- From C + G = 75, we have C = 75 - 48 = 27.\n\n- From C + I = 177, we have I = 177 - 27 = 150.\n\n- From D + F = 96, we have D = 96 - 16 = 80.\n\nNow, we have all the values:\n\n- A = 9 (the only number left)\n- B = 225\n- C = 27\n- D = 80\n- E = 75\n- F = 16\n- G = 48\n- H = 80\n- I = 150\n- J = 50\n- K = 3\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[9, 225, 27, 80, 75, 16, 48, 80, 150, 50, 3]>>>"
