    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 3, 6, 9, 20, 32, 36, 80, 120, and 121 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **B = 2.0G**: This implies that B is twice the value of G. The possible pairs from the given numbers are (6, 3) and (120, 60). However, 60 is not in the list, so the only possible pair is (6, 3), meaning B = 6 and G = 3.\n\n2. **I = 2.5F**: This implies that I is 2.5 times the value of F. The possible pairs from the given numbers are (80, 32) because 80 = 2.5 * 32.\n\n3. **B + I = 86**: We already know B = 6, so I must be 80 to satisfy this equation (6 + 80 = 86).\n\n4. **A + G = 12**: We know G = 3, so A must be 9 to satisfy this equation (9 + 3 = 12).\n\n5. **I > F**: We have I = 80 and F = 32, which satisfies this inequality.\n\n6. **F + I = 112**: We have F = 32 and I = 80, which satisfies this equation (32 + 80 = 112).\n\n7. **C + H = 140**: We need to find C and H such that their sum is 140. The possible pair from the given numbers is (20, 120) because 20 + 120 = 140.\n\n8. **A - H = -11**: We have A = 9, so H must be 20 to satisfy this equation (9 - 20 = -11).\n\nNow, let's assign the remaining numbers to the remaining letters:\n\n- We have used the numbers 3, 6, 9, 20, 32, 80, and 120. The remaining numbers are 36 and 121.\n- The remaining letters are D and E.\n- Since D and E are not involved in any specific equations, we can assign them the remaining numbers in any order. Let's assign D = 36 and E = 121.\n\nFinally, let's list the values for each letter in alphabetical order:\n\n- A = 9\n- B = 6\n- C = 120\n- D = 36\n- E = 121\n- F = 32\n- G = 3\n- H = 20\n- I = 80\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[9, 6, 120, 36, 121, 32, 3, 20, 80]>>>"
