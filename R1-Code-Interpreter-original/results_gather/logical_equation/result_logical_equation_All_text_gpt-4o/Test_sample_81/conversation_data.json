    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, and 96 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and M, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities. Let's analyze each inequality step by step:\n\n1. **F + G = 46**: This means F and G must be two numbers from the list that add up to 46.\n\n2. **J - M = 80**: J must be 80 more than M.\n\n3. **J - F = 86**: J must be 86 more than F.\n\n4. **H - L = 26**: H must be 26 more than L.\n\n5. **B + M = 31**: B and M must be two numbers from the list that add up to 31.\n\n6. **B = 1.5F**: B must be 1.5 times F.\n\n7. **C = 4.0A**: C must be 4 times A.\n\n8. **L = 1.5M**: L must be 1.5 times M.\n\n9. **G = 3.6F**: G must be 3.6 times F.\n\n10. **D = 1.5E**: D must be 1.5 times E.\n\n11. **L - I = -21**: L must be 21 less than I.\n\nNow, let's solve these step by step:\n\n- From **J - M = 80** and **J - F = 86**, we can deduce that M = F + 6.\n\n- From **B = 1.5F** and **B + M = 31**, we can substitute B = 1.5F into the equation to get 1.5F + M = 31. Since M = F + 6, we have 1.5F + F + 6 = 31, which simplifies to 2.5F = 25, so F = 10.\n\n- If F = 10, then M = F + 6 = 16.\n\n- From **B = 1.5F**, B = 1.5 * 10 = 15.\n\n- From **F + G = 46**, G = 46 - F = 36.\n\n- From **G = 3.6F**, G = 3.6 * 10 = 36, which is consistent.\n\n- From **J - F = 86**, J = F + 86 = 96.\n\n- From **J - M = 80**, J = M + 80 = 96, which is consistent.\n\n- From **L = 1.5M**, L = 1.5 * 16 = 24.\n\n- From **H - L = 26**, H = L + 26 = 24 + 26 = 50.\n\n- From **L - I = -21**, I = L + 21 = 24 + 21 = 45.\n\n- From **C = 4.0A**, we need to find A and C such that C = 4A. The remaining numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 28. The only pair that satisfies this is A = 7 and C = 28.\n\n- From **D = 1.5E**, we need to find D and E such that D = 1.5E. The remaining numbers are 2, 3, and 5. The only pair that satisfies this is E = 2 and D = 3.\n\n- The only number left for K is 5.\n\nNow, we can list the values for each letter in alphabetical order:\n\n- A = 7\n- B = 15\n- C = 28\n- D = 3\n- E = 2\n- F = 10\n- G = 36\n- H = 50\n- I = 45\n- J = 96\n- K = 5\n- L = 24\n- M = 16\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[7, 15, 28, 3, 2, 10, 36, 50, 45, 96, 5, 24, 16]>>>"
