    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the given numbers to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K based on the system of inequalities and equations provided. Let's analyze each step carefully:\n\n1. **D + J = 252**: This equation tells us that the sum of the values for D and J is 252.\n\n2. **D = 3.0K**: This equation indicates that D is three times the value of K.\n\n3. **H - A = 44**: This equation tells us that H is 44 more than A.\n\n4. **J > E**: This inequality indicates that the value of J is greater than the value of E.\n\n5. **C = 2.0K**: This equation tells us that C is twice the value of K.\n\n6. **D > A**: This inequality indicates that the value of D is greater than the value of A.\n\n7. **A + F = 52**: This equation tells us that the sum of the values for A and F is 52.\n\n8. **D + E = 228**: This equation tells us that the sum of the values for D and E is 228.\n\n9. **B = 3.0F**: This equation indicates that B is three times the value of F.\n\n10. **E + I = 124**: This equation tells us that the sum of the values for E and I is 124.\n\nNow, let's assign the numbers to the letters:\n\n- The numbers available are: 3, 9, 16, 27, 36, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225.\n\n- From **D = 3.0K**, D must be 3 times K. The only pair that satisfies this from the list is D = 75 and K = 25. However, 25 is not in the list, so let's try D = 225 and K = 75.\n\n- From **C = 2.0K**, C must be twice K. With K = 75, C = 150.\n\n- From **D + J = 252**, with D = 225, J = 252 - 225 = 27.\n\n- From **D + E = 228**, with D = 225, E = 228 - 225 = 3.\n\n- From **E + I = 124**, with E = 3, I = 124 - 3 = 121.\n\n- From **J > E**, J = 27 and E = 3, which satisfies the inequality.\n\n- From **H - A = 44**, we need to find H and A such that H = A + 44. The possible pairs are A = 36 and H = 80.\n\n- From **A + F = 52**, with A = 36, F = 52 - 36 = 16.\n\n- From **B = 3.0F**, with F = 16, B = 3 * 16 = 48.\n\n- The remaining number is 9, which must be assigned to G.\n\nNow, let's list the values in alphabetical order:\n\n- A = 36\n- B = 48\n- C = 150\n- D = 225\n- E = 3\n- F = 16\n- G = 9\n- H = 80\n- I = 121\n- J = 27\n- K = 75\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[36, 48, 150, 225, 3, 16, 9, 80, 121, 27, 75]>>>"
