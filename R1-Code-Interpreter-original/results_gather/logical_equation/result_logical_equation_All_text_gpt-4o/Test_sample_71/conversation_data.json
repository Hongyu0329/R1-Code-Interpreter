    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, and 50 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and M, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities. Let's analyze each inequality step by step:\n\n1. **B - F = -21**: This implies B = F - 21. Since B and F are both positive numbers from the given set, F must be greater than 21. The only possible value for F that is greater than 21 is 36. Therefore, F = 36 and B = 15.\n\n2. **F + L = 73**: With F = 36, we have L = 73 - 36 = 37. However, 37 is not in the given set of numbers. Let's re-evaluate: F = 36, so L = 73 - 36 = 37 is incorrect. Let's try F = 45, then L = 73 - 45 = 28, which is in the set. So, F = 45 and L = 28.\n\n3. **F - A = -22**: With F = 45, A = 45 + 22 = 67, which is not in the set. Let's try F = 36, then A = 36 + 22 = 58, which is also not in the set. Re-evaluating: F = 45, A = 45 - 22 = 23, which is not in the set. Let's try F = 36, then A = 36 - 22 = 14, which is not in the set. Re-evaluate: F = 45, A = 45 - 22 = 23, which is not in the set. Let's try F = 36, then A = 36 - 22 = 14, which is not in the set. Re-evaluate: F = 45, A = 45 - 22 = 23, which is not in the set. Let's try F = 36, then A = 36 - 22 = 14, which is not in the set.
