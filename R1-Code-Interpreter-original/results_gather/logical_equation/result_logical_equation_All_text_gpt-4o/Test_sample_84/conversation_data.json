    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, and 96 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and M, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities. Let's analyze the inequalities step by step:\n\n1. **B = 1.4G**: This implies B is 1.4 times G. Both B and G must be numbers that satisfy this ratio.\n\n2. **A = 3.2G**: A is 3.2 times G. A and G must satisfy this ratio.\n\n3. **J = 3.0G**: J is 3 times G. J and G must satisfy this ratio.\n\n4. **A = 1.6K**: A is 1.6 times K. A and K must satisfy this ratio.\n\n5. **A + J = 31**: The sum of A and J is 31.\n\n6. **A + B = 23**: The sum of A and B is 23.\n\n7. **F = 2.4K**: F is 2.4 times K. F and K must satisfy this ratio.\n\n8. **M - B = 89**: M is 89 more than B.\n\n9. **I - B = 43**: I is 43 more than B.\n\n10. **F = 4.8G**: F is 4.8 times G. F and G must satisfy this ratio.\n\n11. **B = 3.5L**: B is 3.5 times L. B and L must satisfy this ratio.\n\nNow, let's solve these step by step:\n\n- From **B = 1.4G**, **A = 3.2G**, and **J = 3.0G**, we can express B, A, and J in terms of G:\n  - B = 1.4G\n  - A = 3.2G\n  - J = 3.0G\n\n- From **A + J = 31**, substitute A and J:\n  - 3.2G + 3.0G = 31\n  - 6.2G = 31\n  - G = 5\n\n- Now, substitute G = 5 into the expressions for A, B, and J:\n  - A = 3.2 * 5 = 16\n  - B = 1.4 * 5 = 7\n  - J = 3.0 * 5 = 15\n\n- Check **A + B = 23**:\n  - 16 + 7 = 23 (satisfied)\n\n- From **A = 1.6K**, substitute A:\n  - 16 = 1.6K\n  - K = 10\n\n- From **F = 2.4K**, substitute K:\n  - F = 2.4 * 10 = 24\n\n- From **F = 4.8G**, substitute G:\n  - F = 4.8 * 5 = 24 (consistent)\n\n- From **M - B = 89**, substitute B:\n  - M - 7 = 89\n  - M = 96\n\n- From **I - B = 43**, substitute B:\n  - I - 7 = 43\n  - I = 50\n\n- From **B = 3.5L**, substitute B:\n  - 7 = 3.5L\n  - L = 2\n\nNow, we have the following assignments:\n- A = 16\n- B = 7\n- G = 5\n- J = 15\n- K = 10\n- F = 24\n- M = 96\n- I = 50\n- L = 2\n\nThe remaining numbers are 3, 28, 36, and 45, which need to be assigned to C, D, E, and H. Since there are no constraints on these letters, we can assign them arbitrarily from the remaining numbers.\n\nLet's assign:\n- C = 3\n- D = 28\n- E = 36\n- H = 45\n\nThus, the final answer in alphabetical order is:\n<<<[16, 7, 3, 28, 36, 24, 5, 45, 50, 15, 10, 2, 96]>>>"
