    "To solve this problem, we need to assign each letter a unique number from the set {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50} such that all the given inequalities are satisfied. Let's analyze each inequality step by step:\n\n1. **C + M = 43**: C and M must be two numbers from the set that add up to 43.\n\n2. **C = 1.5L**: C must be 1.5 times L. This implies that C must be a multiple of 1.5.\n\n3. **L = 2.0J**: L must be twice J. This implies that L must be an even number.\n\n4. **A + K = 81**: A and K must be two numbers from the set that add up to 81.\n\n5. **C - B = -35**: C must be 35 less than B.\n\n6. **H - K = -20**: H must be 20 less than K.\n\n7. **F = 4.8J**: F must be 4.8 times J. This implies that F must be a multiple of 4.8.\n\n8. **K - M = 8**: K must be 8 more than M.\n\n9. **D + E = 4**: D and E must be two numbers from the set that add up to 4.\n\n10. **K = 2.4C**: K must be 2.4 times C. This implies that K must be a multiple of 2.4.\n\nNow, let's solve these step by step:\n\n- From inequality 9, D + E = 4, the only possible values for D and E from the set are 1 and 3. So, D = 1 and E = 3.\n\n- From inequality 2, C = 1.5L, and considering the set, C must be 1.5 times a number in the set. The possible values for L are 2 and 24, giving C = 3 and 36, respectively. However, C = 3 is not possible because it would not satisfy other conditions. So, L = 24 and C = 36.\n\n- From inequality 3, L = 2.0J, we have L = 24, so J = 12. But 12 is not in the set, so we need to reconsider. If L = 24, J = 12 is not possible. Let's try L = 10, then J = 5.\n\n- From inequality 7, F = 4.8J, with J = 5, F = 24, but 24 is not in the set. So, let's try L = 10, J = 5, and F = 24.\n\n- From inequality 10, K = 2.4C, with C = 36, K = 86.4, which is not possible. So, let's try C = 15, then K = 36.\n\n- From inequality 1, C + M = 43, with C = 36, M = 7.\n\n- From inequality 5, C - B = -35, with C = 36, B = 1.\n\n- From inequality 8, K - M = 8, with K = 36, M = 28.\n\n- From inequality 4, A + K = 81, with K = 36, A = 45.\n\n- From inequality 6, H - K = -20, with K = 36, H = 16.\n\nNow, let's assign the remaining numbers:\n\n- A = 45\n- B = 1\n- C = 36\n- D = 3\n- E = 1\n- F = 15\n- G = 50 (remaining number)\n- H = 16\n- I = 24 (remaining number)\n- J = 5\n- K = 36\n- L = 24\n- M = 7\n\nThe final answer, in alphabetical order, is:\n\n<<<[45, 1, 36, 3, 1, 15, 50, 16, 24, 5, 36, 24, 7]>>>"
