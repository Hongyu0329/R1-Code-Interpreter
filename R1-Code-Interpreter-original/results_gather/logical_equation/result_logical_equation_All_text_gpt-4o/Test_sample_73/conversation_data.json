    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, and 50 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and M, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities. Let's analyze each inequality step by step:\n\n1. **M = 3.0L**: M must be three times L. The possible pairs (L, M) from the given numbers are (5, 15).\n\n2. **F = 2.5H**: F must be 2.5 times H. The possible pairs (H, F) are (2, 5).\n\n3. **E - L = 9**: E must be 9 more than L. With L = 5, E = 14, but 14 is not in the list. So, let's try another approach.\n\n4. **A + I = 60**: A and I must sum to 60. The possible pairs (A, I) are (24, 36) and (36, 24).\n\n5. **E + J = 17**: E and J must sum to 17. The possible pairs (E, J) are (7, 10) and (10, 7).\n\n6. **G - I = 21**: G must be 21 more than I. With I = 24, G = 45, and with I = 36, G = 57, but 57 is not in the list. So, G = 45 and I = 24.\n\n7. **G - A = -9**: G must be 9 less than A. With G = 45, A = 36.\n\n8. **E + G = 46**: E and G must sum to 46. With G = 45, E = 1.\n\n9. **F + M = 8**: F and M must sum to 8. With F = 5, M = 3.\n\n10. **H + I = 17**: H and I must sum to 17. With I = 24, H = -7, which is not possible. So, let's try another approach.\n\nNow, let's assign the numbers based on the above deductions:\n\n- From inequality 1, L = 5 and M = 15.\n- From inequality 2, H = 2 and F = 5.\n- From inequality 3, E = 14 is not possible, so let's try another approach.\n- From inequality 4, A = 36 and I = 24.\n- From inequality 5, E = 7 and J = 10.\n- From inequality 6, G = 45 and I = 24.\n- From inequality 7, G = 45 and A = 36.\n- From inequality 8, E = 1 and G = 45.\n- From inequality 9, F = 5 and M = 3.\n- From inequality 10, H = 2 and I = 24.\n\nNow, let's assign the remaining numbers to the remaining letters:\n\n- B = 1\n- C = 2\n- D = 3\n- K = 28\n\nThe final assignment of numbers to letters is:\n\nA = 36, B = 1, C = 2, D = 3, E = 7, F = 5, G = 45, H = 2, I = 24, J = 10, K = 28, L = 5, M = 15.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<[36, 1, 2, 3, 7, 5, 45, 2, 24, 10, 28, 5, 15]>>>"
