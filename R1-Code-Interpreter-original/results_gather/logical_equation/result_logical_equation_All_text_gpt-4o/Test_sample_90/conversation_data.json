    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, and 96 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and M, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **E + K = 81**: E and K must be two numbers that sum to 81. The possible pairs from the given numbers are (36, 45) and (45, 36).\n\n2. **K > J**: K must be greater than J. This will help us determine J once K is known.\n\n3. **E = 1.5G**: E must be 1.5 times G. This implies E must be a multiple of 1.5.\n\n4. **B + J = 5**: B and J must sum to 5. The only possible pair from the given numbers is (2, 3) or (3, 2).\n\n5. **M - F = -6**: M must be 6 less than F.\n\n6. **K = 4.5M**: K must be 4.5 times M. This implies K must be a multiple of 4.5.\n\n7. **M > B**: M must be greater than B.\n\n8. **F = 3.2C**: F must be 3.2 times C. This implies F must be a multiple of 3.2.\n\n9. **C - E = -31**: C must be 31 less than E.\n\n10. **L = 1.4C**: L must be 1.4 times C. This implies L must be a multiple of 1.4.\n\n11. **A + M = 38**: A and M must sum to 38.\n\n12. **F + I = 112**: F and I must sum to 112.\n\nNow, let's solve the system:\n\n- From condition 1, E and K can be (36, 45) or (45, 36). Let's assume E = 36 and K = 45.\n- From condition 3, E = 1.5G implies G = 24.\n- From condition 9, C = E - 31 = 36 - 31 = 5.\n- From condition 8, F = 3.2C = 3.2 * 5 = 16.\n- From condition 5, M = F - 6 = 16 - 6 = 10.\n- From condition 6, K = 4.5M = 4.5 * 10 = 45, which is consistent.\n- From condition 11, A + M = 38 implies A = 38 - 10 = 28.\n- From condition 12, F + I = 112 implies I = 112 - 16 = 96.\n- From condition 4, B + J = 5. Since B must be less than M (condition 7), B = 2 and J = 3.\n- From condition 10, L = 1.4C = 1.4 * 5 = 7.\n\nNow, we have the following assignments:\n- A = 28\n- B = 2\n- C = 5\n- D = 3 (since D is not used yet, and 3 is the only number left)\n- E = 36\n- F = 16\n- G = 24\n- H = 15 (since H is not used yet, and 15 is the only number left)\n- I = 96\n- J = 3\n- K = 45\n- L = 7\n- M = 10\n\nThe final answer, in alphabetical order, is:\n<<<[28, 2, 5, 3, 36, 16, 24, 15, 96, 3, 45, 7, 10]>>>"
