    "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given system of equations and inequalities step by step to determine the value of each letter. We have nine letters, each representing a unique number from the set {3, 6, 9, 20, 32, 36, 80, 120, 121}. Let's go through the constraints one by one:\n\n1. **A = 1.6G**: This implies that A is 1.6 times the value of G.\n\n2. **E + H = 129**: The sum of E and H is 129.\n\n3. **H = 1.5B**: H is 1.5 times the value of B.\n\n4. **E + I = 130**: The sum of E and I is 130.\n\n5. **A + B = 112**: The sum of A and B is 112.\n\n6. **D + G = 23**: The sum of D and G is 23.\n\n7. **B = 2.5A**: B is 2.5 times the value of A.\n\n8. **B = 4.0G**: B is 4 times the value of G.\n\nNow, let's solve these equations step by step:\n\n- From equation 8, **B = 4.0G**, we can express B in terms of G.\n\n- From equation 7, **B = 2.5A**, we can express A in terms of B, which is also in terms of G from the previous step.\n\n- From equation 1, **A = 1.6G**, we can confirm the relationship between A and G.\n\n- Using equations 5 and 8, we can solve for A and B:\n  - Substitute B = 4G into A + B = 112:\n    - A + 4G = 112\n  - Substitute A = 1.6G into the above equation:\n    - 1.6G + 4G = 112\n    - 5.6G = 112\n    - G = 20\n\n- With G = 20, we can find A and B:\n  - A = 1.6G = 1.6 * 20 = 32\n  - B = 4G = 4 * 20 = 80\n\n- Now, use equation 6, **D + G = 23**:\n  - D + 20 = 23\n  - D = 3\n\n- Use equation 3, **H = 1.5B**:\n  - H = 1.5 * 80 = 120\n\n- Use equation 2, **E + H = 129**:\n  - E + 120 = 129\n  - E = 9\n\n- Use equation 4, **E + I = 130**:\n  - 9 + I = 130\n  - I = 121\n\nNow, we have determined the values for A, B, D, E, G, H, and I. The remaining letters are C and F, which must be the remaining numbers from the set {3, 6, 9, 20, 32, 36, 80, 120, 121}.\n\n- The numbers we have used so far are 3, 9, 20, 32, 80, 120, and 121. The remaining numbers are 6 and 36.\n\n- Assign C = 6 and F = 36, as they are the only numbers left.\n\nFinally, we list the values in alphabetical order:\n\n- A = 32\n- B = 80\n- C = 6\n- D = 3\n- E = 9\n- F = 36\n- G = 20\n- H = 120\n- I = 121\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[32, 80, 6, 3, 9, 36, 20, 120, 121]>>>"
