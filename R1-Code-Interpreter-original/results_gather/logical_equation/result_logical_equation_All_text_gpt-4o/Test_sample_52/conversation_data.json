    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the given numbers to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K based on the system of inequalities and equations provided. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **D > A**: D must be greater than A.\n2. **D - A = 66**: The difference between D and A is 66.\n3. **F - G = -145**: F is 145 less than G.\n4. **B - G = -209**: B is 209 less than G.\n5. **E = 3.0B**: E is three times B.\n6. **I - A = 112**: The difference between I and A is 112.\n7. **D > C**: D must be greater than C.\n8. **A + H = 159**: The sum of A and H is 159.\n9. **D + H = 225**: The sum of D and H is 225.\n10. **E = 2.4J**: E is 2.4 times J.\n11. **A - H = -141**: The difference between A and H is -141.\n\nNow, let's solve these equations:\n\n- From equations 8 and 11, we have:\n  - \\( A + H = 159 \\)\n  - \\( A - H = -141 \\)\n\n  Adding these two equations:\n  \\[\n  2A = 18 \\implies A = 9\n  \\]\n\n  Substituting \\( A = 9 \\) into \\( A + H = 159 \\):\n  \\[\n  9 + H = 159 \\implies H = 150\n  \\]\n\n- From equation 2, \\( D - A = 66 \\):\n  \\[\n  D - 9 = 66 \\implies D = 75\n  \\]\n\n- From equation 9, \\( D + H = 225 \\):\n  \\[\n  75 + 150 = 225 \\quad \\text{(which is consistent)}\n  \\]\n\n- From equation 6, \\( I - A = 112 \\):\n  \\[\n  I - 9 = 112 \\implies I = 121\n  \\]\n\n- From equation 3, \\( F - G = -145 \\):\n  \\[\n  F = G - 145\n  \\]\n\n- From equation 4, \\( B - G = -209 \\):\n  \\[\n  B = G - 209\n  \\]\n\n- From equation 5, \\( E = 3.0B \\):\n  - We need to find B such that E is one of the given numbers and is three times B.\n\n- From equation 10, \\( E = 2.4J \\):\n  - We need to find J such that E is 2.4 times J.\n\nNow, let's assign the remaining numbers to the letters:\n\n- The numbers left are 3, 16, 20, 39, 48, 80, 225.\n- From \\( E = 3.0B \\) and \\( E = 2.4J \\), we can try:\n  - If \\( B = 16 \\), then \\( E = 3 \\times 16 = 48 \\).\n  - If \\( J = 20 \\), then \\( E = 2.4 \\times 20 = 48 \\).\n\n  This is consistent, so:\n  \\[\n  B = 16, \\quad E = 48, \\quad J = 20\n  \\]\n\n- From \\( B = G - 209 \\), \\( B = 16 \\):\n  \\[\n  G = 16 + 209 = 225\n  \\]\n\n- From \\( F = G - 145 \\):\n  \\[\n  F = 225 - 145 = 80\n  \\]\n\n- The remaining numbers are 3 and 39. Since \\( D > C \\) and \\( D = 75 \\), \\( C \\) must be 39.\n\n- The only number left is 3, which must be assigned to K.\n\nThus, the values for each letter are:\n- A = 9\n- B = 16\n- C = 39\n- D = 75\n- E = 48\n- F = 80\n- G = 225\n- H = 150\n- I = 121\n- J = 20\n- K = 3\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<[9, 16, 39, 75, 48, 80, 225, 150, 121, 20, 3]>>>"
