    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 3, 6, 9, 20, 32, 36, 80, 120, and 121 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities. Let's analyze each condition step by step:\n\n1. **B + I = 156**: The possible pairs (B, I) that sum to 156 are (36, 120) and (120, 36).\n\n2. **B + D = 123**: The possible pairs (B, D) that sum to 123 are (3, 120), (6, 117), (9, 114), (20, 103), (32, 91), (36, 87), (80, 43), (120, 3).\n\n3. **D - A = -29**: This implies A = D + 29. Possible pairs (A, D) are (32, 3), (36, 7), (80, 51), (120, 91), (121, 92).\n\n4. **G = 2.0D**: G must be twice the value of D. Possible pairs (G, D) are (6, 3), (18, 9), (40, 20), (64, 32), (72, 36), (160, 80), (240, 120).\n\n5. **B = 1.5C**: B must be 1.5 times the value of C. Possible pairs (B, C) are (9, 6), (18, 12), (30, 20), (48, 32), (54, 36), (120, 80).\n\n6. **A > D**: A must be greater than D.\n\n7. **A - I = -4**: This implies I = A + 4. Possible pairs (A, I) are (3, 7), (6, 10), (9, 13), (20, 24), (32, 36), (36, 40), (80, 84), (120, 124), (121, 125).\n\n8. **C - F = 71**: This implies F = C - 71. Possible pairs (C, F) are (80, 9).\n\nNow, let's find the values that satisfy all these conditions:\n\n- From condition 8, C = 80 and F = 9.\n- From condition 5, B = 1.5 * 80 = 120.\n- From condition 1, B + I = 156, so I = 156 - 120 = 36.\n- From condition 7, A - I = -4, so A = 36 - 4 = 32.\n- From condition 3, D = A - 29 = 32 - 29 = 3.\n- From condition 4, G = 2.0 * D = 2.0 * 3 = 6.\n\nNow we have:\n- A = 32\n- B = 120\n- C = 80\n- D = 3\n- E = 20 (since E is not involved in any condition, it takes the remaining number)\n- F = 9\n- G = 6\n- H = 121 (since H is not involved in any condition, it takes the remaining number)\n- I = 36\n\nThe final answer, in alphabetical order, is:\n<<<[32, 120, 80, 3, 20, 9, 6, 121, 36]>>>"
