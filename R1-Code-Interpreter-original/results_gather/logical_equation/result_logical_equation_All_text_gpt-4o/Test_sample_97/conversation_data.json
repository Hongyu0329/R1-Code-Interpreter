    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, and 96 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and M, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities. Let's analyze each inequality step by step:\n\n1. **A - L = -5**: This implies L = A + 5.\n\n2. **I = 3.2C**: I is 3.2 times C.\n\n3. **J + M = 60**: The sum of J and M is 60.\n\n4. **L + M = 31**: The sum of L and M is 31.\n\n5. **C = 2.5A**: C is 2.5 times A.\n\n6. **L = 3.5A**: L is 3.5 times A.\n\n7. **D = 4.0M**: D is 4 times M.\n\n8. **B = 4.5G**: B is 4.5 times G.\n\n9. **I + M = 40**: The sum of I and M is 40.\n\n10. **A + D = 98**: The sum of A and D is 98.\n\n11. **F = 1.5G**: F is 1.5 times G.\n\n12. **D + G = 106**: The sum of D and G is 106.\n\nNow, let's solve these equations step by step:\n\n- From equation 6, L = 3.5A. Since L must be one of the given numbers, and 3.5A must also be one of the given numbers, we can try different values for A to satisfy this condition. \n\n- From equation 1, L = A + 5. Combining with equation 6, we have 3.5A = A + 5, which simplifies to 2.5A = 5, giving A = 2. However, A = 2 does not satisfy the given set of numbers. Let's try another approach.\n\n- From equation 5, C = 2.5A. C must be one of the given numbers, so A must be a number such that 2.5A is also in the list. \n\n- From equation 6, L = 3.5A. L must be one of the given numbers, so A must be a number such that 3.5A is also in the list.\n\n- Let's try A = 10. Then C = 2.5 * 10 = 25, which is not in the list. Try A = 5. Then C = 2.5 * 5 = 12.5, which is not in the list. Try A = 7. Then C = 2.5 * 7 = 17.5, which is not in the list. Try A = 2. Then C = 2.5 * 2 = 5, which is in the list.\n\n- If A = 2, then L = 3.5 * 2 = 7, which is not in the list. Try A = 10. Then L = 3.5 * 10 = 35, which is not in the list. Try A = 15.

Then L = 3.5 * 50 = 175, which is not in the list. Try A = 96. Then L = 3.5 * 96 = 336, which is not in the list.\n\n- Let's try A = 10. Then C = 2.5 * 10 = 25, which is not in the list. Try A = 5.
