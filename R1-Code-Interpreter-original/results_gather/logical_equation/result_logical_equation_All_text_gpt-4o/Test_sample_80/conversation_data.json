    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, and 96 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and M, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities. Let's analyze each inequality step by step:\n\n1. **D = 3.0L**: This implies D is three times L. The possible pairs from the given numbers are (15, 5), (24, 8), (36, 12), (45, 15), (96, 32). However, only (96, 32) fits the given numbers, but 32 is not in the list. So, we need to find another pair that fits the constraints.\n\n2. **F + L = 17**: This implies F and L must sum to 17. Possible pairs are (2, 15), (3, 14), (5, 12), (7, 10). Only (2, 15) fits the given numbers.\n\n3. **I + J = 33**: This implies I and J must sum to 33. Possible pairs are (5, 28), (7, 26), (10, 23), (15, 18). Only (5, 28) fits the given numbers.\n\n4. **I - D = -17**: This implies I is 17 less than D. From the numbers, if I = 5, then D = 22, which is not in the list. If I = 28, then D = 45, which fits.\n\n5. **I - E = 21**: This implies I is 21 more than E. If I = 28, then E = 7, which fits.\n\n6. **D - C = 29**: This implies D is 29 more than C. If D = 45, then C = 16, which fits.\n\n7. **A = 4.0B**: This implies A is four times B. Possible pairs are (8, 2), (12, 3), (20, 5), (28, 7). Only (28, 7) fits the given numbers.\n\n8. **F - C = -14**: This implies F is 14 less than C. If F = 2, then C = 16, which fits.\n\n9. **L = 3.0J**: This implies L is three times J. If L = 15, then J = 5, which fits.\n\n10. **L - D = -30**: This implies L is 30 less than D. If L = 15, then D = 45, which fits.\n\n11. **F - B = -22**: This implies F is 22 less than B. If F = 2, then B = 24, which is not in the list. So, we need to find another pair that fits the constraints.\n\nNow, let's assign the numbers to the letters based on the above analysis:\n\n- A = 28\n- B = 7\n- C = 16\n- D = 45\n- E = 7\n- F = 2\n- G = 3 (remaining number)\n- H = 10 (remaining number)\n- I = 28\n- J = 5\n- K = 36 (remaining number)\n- L = 15\n- M = 96 (remaining number)\n\nThe final answer, in alphabetical order, is:\n\n<<<[28, 7, 16, 45, 7, 2, 3, 10, 28, 5, 36, 15, 96]>>>"
