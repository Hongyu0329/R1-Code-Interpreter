    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's analyze what we know:\n- We have 13 letters (A to M)\n- Each letter represents one of: 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, 96\n- We have 11 equations/inequalities\n\n2) Let's write a program to solve this using constraint satisfaction:\n- We'll try all possible permutations and check which one satisfies all conditions\n- We'll use efficient filtering to reduce the search space\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef check_conditions(values, perm):\n    A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M = perm\n    \n    # Check all conditions\n    if L - I != -23:  # Condition 1\n        return False\n    if I + M != 44:   # Condition 2\n        return False\n    if D + K != 98:   # Condition 3\n        return False\n    if F + I != 73:   # Condition 4\n        return False\n    if F <= J:        # Condition 5\n        return False\n    if B - C != 26:   # Condition 6\n        return False\n    if abs(B - 2.4*A) > 0.0001:  # Condition 7 (using small epsilon for float comparison)\n        return False\n    if C + F != 55:   # Condition 8\n        return False\n    if F - J != 38:   # Condition 9\n        return False\n    if H - F != 5:    # Condition 10\n        return False\n    if abs(J - 1.4*L) > 0.0001:  # Condition 11\n        return False\n    return True\n\n# The possible values\nvalues = [2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, 96]\n\n# Try all permutations\nfor perm in permutations(values):\n    if check_conditions(values, perm):\n        print(list(perm))\n        break\n```\n\nLet's analyze the output. The program will give us a list where:\n- Index 0 corresponds to A\n- Index 1 corresponds to B\n- And so on...\n\nThe code will find the unique solution that satisfies all conditions.
