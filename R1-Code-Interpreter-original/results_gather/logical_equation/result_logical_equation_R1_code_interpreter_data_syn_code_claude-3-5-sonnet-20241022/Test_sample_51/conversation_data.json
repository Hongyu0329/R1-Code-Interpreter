    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need to do:\n- We have 11 letters (A to K)\n- Each letter represents one number from the given set\n- We have 11 equations/inequalities to satisfy\n\n2) Let's write a program to solve this using constraint satisfaction:\n- We'll try different permutations of the numbers\n- Check if all equations are satisfied\n- Return the correct assignment\n\nHere's the code to solve this:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef check_conditions(values):\n    A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K = values\n    \n    # Check all conditions\n    if K != 2.0 * E:  # K = 2.0E\n        return False\n    if E - C != 72:  # E - C = 72\n        return False\n    if J - G != -205:  # J - G = -205\n        return False\n    if A + F != 128:  # A + F = 128\n        return False\n    if C + F != 51:  # C + F = 51\n        return False\n    if G != 1.5 * K:  # G = 1.5K\n        return False\n    if B + C != 19:  # B + C = 19\n        return False\n    if H != 3.0 * C:  # H = 3.0C\n        return False\n    if F != 2.4 * J:  # F = 2.4J\n        return False\n    if G + J != 245:  # G + J = 245\n        return False\n    if K <= H:  # K > H\n        return False\n    return True\n\n# Numbers to assign\nnumbers = [3, 9, 16, 20, 39, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225]\n\n# Try all possible permutations\nfor perm in permutations(numbers):\n    if check_conditions(perm):\n        print(list(perm))\n        break\n```\n\nLet's analyze the output.

K = 2.0E: If K = 150 and E = 75, this works\n2. E - C = 72: If E = 75 and C = 3, this works\n3. G + J = 245: If G = 225 and J = 20, this works\n4. F = 2.4J: If F = 48 and J = 20, this works\n5. H = 3.0C: If H = 9 and C = 3, this works\n\nThe solution appears to be correct and satisfies all given conditions.\n\n<<<[80, 16, 3, 39, 75, 48, 225, 9, 121, 20, 150]>>>",
