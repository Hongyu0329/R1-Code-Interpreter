    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we're looking for:\n- We need to assign 13 numbers to 13 letters\n- The numbers are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50\n- We have 10 constraints that need to be satisfied\n\n2) Let's write a program to solve this using constraint satisfaction:\n- We'll try all possible permutations and check which one satisfies all constraints\n- We'll use Python's itertools for permutations\n- We'll create functions to check each constraint\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef check_constraints(perm):\n    # Map letters to values\n    A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M = perm\n    \n    # Check all constraints\n    if F + J != 86: return False  # 1\n    if B != 4.5 * A: return False  # 2\n    if A + K != 15: return False  # 3\n    if M != 3.0 * L: return False  # 4\n    if H != 1.5 * A: return False  # 5\n    if J <= D: return False  # 6\n    if A - M != 7: return False  # 7\n    if B + E != 52: return False  # 8\n    if A <= G: return False  # 9\n    if H <= L: return False  # 10\n    \n    return True\n\n# Numbers to assign\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50]\n\n# Try all permutations\nfor perm in permutations(numbers):\n    if check_constraints(perm):\n        print(list(perm))\n        break\n```\n\nLet's analyze the output.

Starts with F + J = 86 constraint, which can only be satisfied by 50 + 36\n2. Uses the mathematical constraints (B = 4.5A, H = 1.5A, etc.) to drastically reduce the search space\n3. Checks constraints as early as possible to prune invalid branches\n4. Uses remaining numbers lists to avoid duplicates\n\nLet's analyze the output. The program should run much faster now as it's using strong constraints to limit the search space.\n\n<<<[10, 45, 7, 28, 7, 50, 2, 15, 24, 36, 5, 1, 3]>>>"
