    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we're looking for:\n- We need to assign 13 numbers to 13 letters\n- The numbers are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50\n- We have 10 equations/inequalities to satisfy\n\n2) Let's write a program to solve this using constraint satisfaction:\n- We'll try all possible permutations and check which one satisfies all conditions\n- We'll use Python's itertools for permutations\n- We'll create functions to check each condition\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef check_conditions(perm):\n    A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M = perm\n    \n    # Check all conditions\n    if B + L != 35:  # Condition 1\n        return False\n    if J <= D:  # Condition 2\n        return False\n    if L - J != -8:  # Condition 3\n        return False\n    if abs(I - 3.6 * H) > 0.1:  # Condition 4 (using small tolerance)\n        return False\n    if B + I != 64:  # Condition 5\n        return False\n    if H + I != 46:  # Condition 6\n        return False\n    if C + L != 31:  # Condition 7\n        return False\n    if G + K != 19:  # Condition 8\n        return False\n    if M - J != 30:  # Condition 9\n        return False\n    if abs(K - 3.2 * E) > 0.1:  # Condition 10 (using small tolerance)\n        return False\n    return True\n\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50]\n\n# Try all permutations\nfor perm in permutations(numbers):\n    if check_conditions(perm):\n        print(list(perm))\n        break\n```\n\nLet's analyze the output.
