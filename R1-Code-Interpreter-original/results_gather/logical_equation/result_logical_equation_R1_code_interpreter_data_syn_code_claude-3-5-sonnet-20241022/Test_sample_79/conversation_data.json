    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need to do:\n- We need to assign 13 numbers to 13 letters\n- The numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, 96\n- We have 11 equations/constraints to satisfy\n\n2) This is a constraint satisfaction problem. Let's write a program to:\n- Try different combinations\n- Check all constraints\n- Find the valid solution\n\nHere's the code to solve this:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef check_constraints(assignment):\n    A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M = assignment\n    \n    # Check all constraints\n    if F + J != 15: return False  # 1\n    if F - G != -91: return False  # 2\n    if abs(D - 3.5*K) > 0.01: return False  # 3\n    if E + G != 141: return False  # 4\n    if A - K != 13: return False  # 5\n    if F + M != 29: return False  # 6\n    if abs(D - 1.4*F) > 0.01: return False  # 7\n    if abs(L - 4.0*D) > 0.01: return False  # 8\n    if abs(C - 3.6*J) > 0.01: return False  # 9\n    if A + M != 39: return False  # 10\n    if abs(C - 2.4*A) > 0.01: return False  # 11\n    \n    return True\n\n# Numbers to assign\nnumbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, 96]\n\n# Try all possible permutations\nfor perm in permutations(numbers):\n    if check_constraints(perm):\n        print(list(perm))\n        break\n```\n\nLet's analyze the output.
