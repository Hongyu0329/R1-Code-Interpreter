    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need to do:\n- We need to assign 11 numbers to 11 letters\n- The numbers are: 3, 9, 16, 20, 39, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225\n- We have 11 equations/inequalities that must be satisfied\n\n2) Let's write a program to solve this using a systematic approach:\n- We'll try all possible permutations and check which one satisfies all conditions\n- We'll use Python's itertools for permutations\n- We'll create functions to check each condition\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef check_conditions(perm):\n    A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K = perm\n    \n    # Check all conditions\n    if A + I != 300:  # Condition 1\n        return False\n    if abs(E - 2.4*C) > 0.1:  # Condition 2 (using small tolerance)\n        return False\n    if abs(G - 3.0*K) > 0.1:  # Condition 3\n        return False\n    if J <= A:  # Condition 4\n        return False\n    if abs(A - G - 66) > 0.1:  # Condition 5\n        return False\n    if abs(J - 4.0*C) > 0.1:  # Condition 6\n        return False\n    if abs(I - 3.0*A) > 0.1:  # Condition 7\n        return False\n    if abs(F - 2.0*A) > 0.1:  # Condition 8\n        return False\n    if abs(I - 1.5*F) > 0.1:  # Condition 9\n        return False\n    if abs(A - C - 55) > 0.1:  # Condition 10\n        return False\n    if abs(H - A + 59) > 0.1:  # Condition 11\n        return False\n    return True\n\nnumbers = [3, 9, 16, 20, 39, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225]\n\n# Try all permutations\nfor perm in permutations(numbers):\n    if check_conditions(perm):\n        print(list(perm))\n        break\n```\n\nLet's analyze the output. The program will find the unique solution that satisfies all conditions.\n\nBased on the equations:\n1. From A + I = 300 and I = 3.0A, we can deduce that A = 75\n2. Then I = 3.0A = 225\n3. From A - C = 55, we know C = 20\n4. J = 4.0C = 80\n5. F = 2.0A = 150\n6. From A - G = 66, we know G = 9\n7. From G = 3.0K, we know K = 3\n8. From E = 2.4C, we know E = 48\n9. From H - A = -59, we know H = 16\n10. B is the remaining number, which is 39\n\nTherefore, in alphabetical order:\n\n<<<[75, 39, 20, 121, 48, 150, 9, 16, 225, 80, 3]>>>",
    "The code execution confirms my reasoning. Let me verify the solution one final time:\n\nA = 75: Satisfies all equations involving A\nB = 39: This was the remaining number\nC = 20: Satisfies A - C = 55 (75 - 20 = 55)\nD = 121: This was one of the remaining numbers\nE = 48: Satisfies E = 2.4C (48 = 2.4 × 20)\nF = 150: Satisfies F = 2.0A (150 = 2.0 × 75)\nG = 9: Satisfies A - G = 66 (75 - 9 = 66)\nH = 16: Satisfies H - A = -59 (16 - 75 = -59)\nI = 225: Satisfies I = 3.0A (225 = 3.0 × 75)\nJ = 80: Satisfies J = 4.0C (80 = 4.0 × 20)\nK = 3: Satisfies G = 3.0K (9 = 3.0 × 3)\n\nAll conditions are met, and each number from the given set is used exactly once. Therefore, I can confirm the final answer:\n\n<<<[75, 39, 20, 121, 48, 150, 9, 16, 225, 80, 3]>>>"
