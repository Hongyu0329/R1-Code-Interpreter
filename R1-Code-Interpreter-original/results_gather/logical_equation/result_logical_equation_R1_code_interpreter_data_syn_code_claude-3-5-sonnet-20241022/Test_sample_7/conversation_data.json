    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's analyze what we know:\n   - Each letter represents one of: 1, 3, 4, 9, 16, 27, 36, 80, 121\n   - We have several equations that relate these letters\n   - We need to find a unique solution that satisfies all conditions\n\n2) Let's write a program to find all possible combinations that satisfy these conditions:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef check_conditions(values, numbers):\n    A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I = values\n    \n    # Check all conditions\n    if D + H != 13:\n        return False\n    if E - C != 15:\n        return False\n    if C + H != 5:\n        return False\n    if H != 4.0 * C:\n        return False\n    if H - B != -117:\n        return False\n    if F != 3.0 * C:\n        return False\n    if F + H != 7:\n        return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# The possible numbers\nnumbers = [1, 3, 4, 9, 16, 27, 36, 80, 121]\n\n# Try all possible permutations\nfor perm in permutations(numbers):\n    if check_conditions(perm, numbers):\n        print(list(perm))\n```\n\nLet's analyze the output and verify if we have a unique solution.\n\nThe equations give us some direct relationships:\n- From C + H = 5 and H = 4C, we can solve that C = 1 and H = 4\n- From F = 3C and F + H = 7, we can verify that F = 3\n- From H - B = -117, we know that B = 121\n- From D + H = 13, we know that D = 9\n- From E - C = 15, we know that E = 16\n\nLet me write a program to verify this solution and find the remaining values:\n\n```python\ndef verify_solution():\n    numbers = set([1, 3, 4, 9, 16, 27, 36, 80, 121])\n    \n    # Known values\n    C = 1\n    H = 4\n    F = 3\n    B = 121\n    D = 9\n    E = 16\n    \n    # Verify all equations\n    assert D + H == 13\n    assert E - C == 15\n    assert C + H == 5\n    assert H == 4.0 * C\n    assert H - B == -117\n    assert F == 3.0 * C\n    assert F + H == 7\n    \n    # Find remaining values (A, G, I)\n    remaining = numbers - {B, C, D, E, F, H}\n    \n    # Sort all values in alphabetical order\n    solution = [\n        list(remaining)[0],  # A\n        B,                   # B\n        C,                   # C\n        D,                   # D\n        E,                   # E\n        F,                   # F\n        list(remaining)[1],  # G\n        H,                   # I\n        list(remaining)[2]   # H\n    ]\n    \n    print(solution)\n\nverify_solution()\n```\n\nBased on the solution, we can now provide the answer in alphabetical order:\n\n<<<[36, 121, 1, 9, 16, 3, 27, 4, 80]>>>",
    "I notice that the code output shows multiple possible solutions.

However, we need to choose one solution based on the given conditions. Since all solutions have the same values for B, C, D, E, F, and H, the only difference is in the arrangement of A, G, and I among the remaining numbers (27, 36, 80).\n\nLooking at the original problem, there's no additional constraint that would help us distinguish between these solutions.
