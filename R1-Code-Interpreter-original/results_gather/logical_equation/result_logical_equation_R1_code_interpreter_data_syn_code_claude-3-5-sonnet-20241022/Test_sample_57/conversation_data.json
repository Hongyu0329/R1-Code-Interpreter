    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's analyze what we know:\n- We have 11 letters (A to K)\n- Each letter represents one of: 3, 9, 16, 20, 39, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225\n- We have both equality and inequality constraints\n\n2) From the equations:\n- From C - G = -36 and C + G = 42, we can solve for C and G\n  * Adding these equations: 2C = 6, so C = 3\n  * Substituting back: G = 39\n\n3) Let's write a program to find all possible combinations that satisfy all constraints:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef check_constraints(values, positions):\n    A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K = [values[positions[x]] for x in 'ABCDEFGHIJK']\n    \n    # Check all equality constraints\n    if C - G != -36: return False\n    if C - F != -17: return False\n    if B + F != 68: return False\n    if E + H != 137: return False\n    if A + K != 375: return False\n    if C + H != 124: return False\n    if F - G != -19: return False\n    if C + G != 42: return False\n    \n    # Check inequality constraints\n    if not (A > F): return False\n    if not (J > C): return False\n    if not (A > C): return False\n    \n    return True\n\nnumbers = [3, 9, 16, 20, 39, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225]\nletters = 'ABCDEFGHIJK'\n\n# Try all possible permutations\nfor perm in permutations(range(11)):\n    positions = {letter: pos for letter, pos in zip(letters, perm)}\n    if check_constraints(numbers, positions):\n        result = [numbers[positions[letter]] for letter in letters]\n        print(result)\n        break\n```\n\nThe code will try all possible permutations of the numbers and check which one satisfies all the constraints.
