    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we're looking for:\n   - We need to assign 13 numbers to 13 letters\n   - The numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, 96\n   - We have 12 equations/inequalities that must be satisfied\n\n2) Let's write a program to solve this.
