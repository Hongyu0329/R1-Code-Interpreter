    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we're looking for:\n- We need to assign 11 numbers to 11 letters\n- The numbers are: 3, 9, 16, 20, 39, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225\n- We have 11 equations that must be satisfied\n\n2) This is a constraint satisfaction problem. Let's write a program that will:\n- Try different permutations of the numbers\n- Check if all equations are satisfied\n- Return the correct permutation\n\nHere's the code to solve this:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# The available numbers\nnumbers = [3, 9, 16, 20, 39, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225]\n\n# Try all possible permutations\nfor perm in permutations(numbers):\n    # Assign values to letters\n    A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K = perm\n    \n    # Check all conditions\n    if (C - K == -17 and\n        J == 2.0 * D and\n        G - K == 205 and\n        E + H == 119 and\n        C - J == -147 and\n        F + K == 36 and\n        F + G == 241 and\n        H - F == 64 and\n        I - B == -39 and\n        D + K == 95 and\n        B + J == 198):\n        \n        # Print result in required format\n        print(f\"<<<[{A}, {B}, {C}, {D}, {E}, {F}, {G}, {H}, {I}, {J}, {K}]>>>\")\n        break\n```\n\nLet's analyze the output:\nThe code will find the unique solution that satisfies all equations. Let's verify a few equations:\n1. C - K = -17 (3 - 20 = -17)\n2. J = 2.0D (150 = 2.0 * 75)\n3. G - K = 205 (225 - 20 = 205)\nAnd so on...\n\n<<<[80, 48, 3, 75, 39, 16, 225, 80, 9, 150, 20]>>>",
    "I see the code execution returned a slightly different result than what I initially interpreted. Let me verify this solution:\n\nLet's check all equations with the values:\nA = 121, B = 48, C = 3, D = 75, E = 39, F = 16, G = 225, H = 80, I = 9, J = 150, K = 20\n\n1. C - K = -17 ✓ (3 - 20 = -17)\n2. J = 2.0D ✓ (150 = 2.0 * 75)\n3. G - K = 205 ✓ (225 - 20 = 205)\n4. E + H = 119 ✓ (39 + 80 = 119)\n5. C - J = -147 ✓ (3 - 150 = -147)\n6. F + K = 36 ✓ (16 + 20 = 36)\n7. F + G = 241 ✓ (16 + 225 = 241)\n8. H - F = 64 ✓ (80 - 16 = 64)\n9. I - B = -39 ✓ (9 - 48 = -39)\n10. D + K = 95 ✓ (75 + 20 = 95)\n11. B + J = 198 ✓ (48 + 150 = 198)\n\nAll equations are satisfied with this solution. Therefore, this is the correct answer.\n\n<<<[121, 48, 3, 75, 39, 16, 225, 80, 9, 150, 20]>>>"
