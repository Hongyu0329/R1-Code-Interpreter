    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we're looking for:\n- We need to assign 13 numbers to 13 letters\n- The numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, 96\n- We have 11 equations/inequalities to satisfy\n\n2) Let's write a program to solve this using constraint satisfaction:\n- We'll try all possible permutations and check which one satisfies all conditions\n- We'll use Python's itertools for permutations\n- We'll create functions to check each condition\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef check_conditions(perm):\n    A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M = perm\n    \n    # Check all conditions\n    if K - G != 25: return False\n    if F != 3.5 * M: return False\n    if B + E != 141: return False\n    if J + K != 38: return False\n    if B + I != 50: return False\n    if A - G != 33: return False\n    if I + M != 7: return False\n    if A - H != -14: return False\n    if M - H != -48: return False\n    if C - E != -72: return False\n    if F != 1.4 * I: return False\n    \n    return True\n\nnumbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, 96]\n\n# Try all permutations\nfor perm in permutations(numbers):\n    if check_conditions(perm):\n        print(list(perm))\n        break\n```\n\nLet's analyze the output.
