    "Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we need to do:\n- We need to assign 13 numbers to 13 letters\n- The numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, 96\n- We have 11 equations/inequalities to satisfy\n\n2) Let's write a program to solve this using constraint satisfaction:\n- We'll try all possible permutations and check which one satisfies all conditions\n- We'll use Python's itertools for permutations\n- We'll create functions to check each condition\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef check_conditions(perm):\n    A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M = perm\n    \n    # Check all conditions\n    if A - C != 26:  # Condition 1\n        return False\n    if M <= L:  # Condition 2\n        return False\n    if abs(C - 2.0 * D) > 0.01:  # Condition 3\n        return False\n    if E + I != 57:  # Condition 4\n        return False\n    if abs(L - 1.6 * C) > 0.01:  # Condition 5\n        return False\n    if G - K != -12:  # Condition 6\n        return False\n    if abs(K - 1.5 * C) > 0.01:  # Condition 7\n        return False\n    if abs(A - 3.6 * C) > 0.01:  # Condition 8\n        return False\n    if abs(M - 4.8 * D) > 0.01:  # Condition 9\n        return False\n    if C + F != 106:  # Condition 10\n        return False\n    if H - G != 42:  # Condition 11\n        return False\n    return True\n\nnumbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, 96]\n\n# Try all permutations\nfor perm in permutations(numbers):\n    if check_conditions(perm):\n        print(list(perm))\n        break\n```\n\nLet's analyze the output.
