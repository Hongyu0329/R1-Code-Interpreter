    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the correct numbers to each letter based on the given system of inequalities. We have 11 letters and 11 numbers, and we need to satisfy all the given equations.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **C = 3.0J**: This means C is three times J.\n2. **F + K = 375**: The sum of F and K is 375.\n3. **H = 3.0D**: H is three times D.\n4. **D + F = 234**: The sum of D and F is 234.\n5. **J - B = -59**: J is 59 less than B.\n6. **J + K = 166**: The sum of J and K is 166.\n7. **B - H = 48**: B is 48 more than H.\n8. **K - C = 102**: K is 102 more than C.\n9. **C + K = 198**: The sum of C and K is 198.\n10. **D - B = -66**: D is 66 less than B.\n\nGiven numbers: 3, 9, 16, 27, 36, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225.\n\nWe will use these equations to find the values of each letter. Let's start by solving the equations step by step.\n\nFirst, let's solve for C and K using equations 8 and 9:\n- From equation 9: C + K = 198\n- From equation 8: K - C = 102\n\nAdding these two equations:\n- (C + K) + (K - C) = 198 + 102\n- 2K = 300\n- K = 150\n\nSubstitute K = 150 into equation 9:\n- C + 150 = 198\n- C = 48\n\nNow, let's solve for J using equation 1:\n- C = 3.0J\n- 48 = 3.0J\n- J = 16\n\nNext, solve for B using equation 5:\n- J - B = -59\n- 16 - B = -59\n- B = 75\n\nNow, solve for D using equation 10:\n- D - B = -66\n- D - 75 = -66\n- D = 9\n\nNow, solve for H using equation 3:\n- H = 3.0D\n- H = 3 * 9\n- H = 27\n\nNow, solve for F using equation 4:\n- D + F = 234\n- 9 + F = 234\n- F = 225\n\nFinally, we have all the values except A, E, G, and I. We will assign the remaining numbers to these letters.\n\nRemaining numbers: 3, 36, 80, 121\n\nLet's assign them in alphabetical order:\n- A = 3\n- E = 36\n- G = 80\n- I = 121\n\nNow, let's verify the solution by checking if all equations are satisfied with these values.\n\n```python\n# Assigning the values to the letters\nA, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K = 3, 75, 48, 9, 36, 225, 80, 27, 121, 16, 150\n\n# Checking all the equations\nequations = [\n    C == 3.0 * J,\n    F + K == 375,\n    H == 3.0 * D,\n    D + F == 234,\n    J - B == -59,\n    J + K == 166,\n    B - H == 48,\n    K - C == 102,\n    C + K == 198,\n    D - B == -66\n]\n\n# Verify if all equations are satisfied\nall_satisfied = all(equations)\n\nprint(all_satisfied)\n```\n\nIf the code returns `True`, it means all equations are satisfied with the assigned values. Let's execute the code to verify.",
    "The code output indicates that all the equations are satisfied with the assigned values. Therefore, the solution is correct.\n\nThe values for each letter in alphabetical order are:\n\n- A = 3\n- B = 75\n- C = 48\n- D = 9\n- E = 36\n- F = 225\n- G = 80\n- H = 27\n- I = 121\n- J = 16\n- K = 150\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[3, 75, 48, 9, 36, 225, 80, 27, 121, 16, 150]>>>"
