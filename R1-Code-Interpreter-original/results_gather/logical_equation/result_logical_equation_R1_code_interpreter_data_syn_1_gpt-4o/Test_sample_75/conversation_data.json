    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, 96 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M such that all the given inequalities and equations are satisfied.\n\nLet's break down the constraints and solve them step by step:\n\n1. **L - I = -23**: This implies L = I - 23.\n2. **I + M = 44**: This implies M = 44 - I.\n3. **D + K = 98**: D and K must be chosen such that their sum is 98.\n4. **F + I = 73**: This implies F = 73 - I.\n5. **F > J**: F must be greater than J.\n6. **B - C = 26**: This implies B = C + 26.\n7. **B = 2.4A**: B must be 2.4 times A.\n8. **C + F = 55**: This implies F = 55 - C.\n9. **F - J = 38**: This implies J = F - 38.\n10. **H - F = 5**: This implies H = F + 5.\n11. **J = 1.4L**: J must be 1.4 times L.\n\nWe will use these equations to find the values of the letters. Let's start by writing a Python script to solve these equations and find the values of each letter.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Possible values for the letters\nvalues = [2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, 96]\n\n# Iterate over all permutations of the values\nfor perm in permutations(values):\n    A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M = perm\n    \n    # Check all conditions\n    if (L - I == -23 and\n        I + M == 44 and\n        D + K == 98 and\n        F + I == 73 and\n        F > J and\n        B - C == 26 and\n        B == 2.4 * A and\n        C + F == 55 and\n        F - J == 38 and\n        H - F == 5 and\n        J == 1.4 * L):\n        \n        # If all conditions are satisfied, print the result\n        print([A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M])\n        break\n```\n\nThis script will iterate over all permutations of the given values and check if they satisfy all the given conditions.

    "The timeout error indicates that the code took too long to execute, likely due to the large number of permutations being checked. To optimize the solution, we can reduce the search space by solving some of the equations analytically before iterating over permutations. Let's solve some of the equations to narrow down the possibilities:\n\n1. From **L - I = -23**, we have L = I - 23.\n2. From **I + M = 44**, we have M = 44 - I.\n3.
