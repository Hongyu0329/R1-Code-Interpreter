    "To solve this problem, we need to find the values of the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I that satisfy the given system of inequalities. The values that each letter can take are 3, 6, 9, 20, 32, 36, 80, 120, and 121.\n\nLet's analyze the inequalities:\n\n1. \\( D = 1.5I \\)\n2. \\( I = 2.5H \\)\n3. \\( C + H = 52 \\)\n4. \\( I = 4.0C \\)\n5. \\( C - H = -12 \\)\n6. \\( D + I = 200 \\)\n7. \\( B - H = -23 \\)\n8. \\( H = 1.6C \\)\n\nFrom inequalities 3 and 5, we can derive:\n- \\( C + H = 52 \\)\n- \\( C - H = -12 \\)\n\nAdding these two equations, we get:\n- \\( 2C = 40 \\) which implies \\( C = 20 \\).\n\nSubstituting \\( C = 20 \\) into \\( C + H = 52 \\), we get:\n- \\( 20 + H = 52 \\) which implies \\( H = 32 \\).\n\nNow, substituting \\( H = 32 \\) into \\( I = 2.5H \\), we get:\n- \\( I = 2.5 \\times 32 = 80 \\).\n\nSubstituting \\( I = 80 \\) into \\( D = 1.5I \\), we get:\n- \\( D = 1.5 \\times 80 = 120 \\).\n\nNow, substituting \\( H = 32 \\) into \\( B - H = -23 \\), we get:\n- \\( B - 32 = -23 \\) which implies \\( B = 9 \\).\n\nNow, we have the values for C, H, I, D, and B. The remaining letters are A, E, F, and G. The remaining numbers are 3, 6, 36, and 121.\n\nSince there are no specific inequalities for A, E, F, and G, we can assign the remaining numbers to these letters in any order. Let's assign them in ascending order:\n\n- A = 3\n- E = 6\n- F = 36\n- G = 121\n\nNow, let's verify the solution by checking if all inequalities are satisfied with these values. If they are, we can return the final answer.\n\nLet's write a Python script to verify the solution and ensure all inequalities are satisfied.\n\n```python\n# Assigning values to the letters\nA = 3\nB = 9\nC = 20\nD = 120\nE = 6\nF = 36\nG = 121\nH = 32\nI = 80\n\n# Verifying the inequalities\ninequalities_satisfied = (\n    D == 1.5 * I and\n    I == 2.5 * H and\n    C + H == 52 and\n    I == 4.0 * C and\n    C - H == -12 and\n    D + I == 200 and\n    B - H == -23 and\n    H == 1.6 * C\n)\n\nprint(inequalities_satisfied)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify if all inequalities are satisfied.",
    "The code output indicates that all the inequalities are satisfied with the assigned values. Therefore, the solution is correct. The values for each letter in alphabetical order are:\n\n- A = 3\n- B = 9\n- C = 20\n- D = 120\n- E = 6\n- F = 36\n- G = 121\n- H = 32\n- I = 80\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[3, 9, 20, 120, 6, 36, 121, 32, 80]>>>"
