    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the given numbers to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K such that all the given inequalities and equations are satisfied. The numbers available are 3, 9, 16, 20, 39, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, and 225.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n\n1. \\( F = 2.4D \\)\n2. \\( G = 1.5K \\)\n3. \\( G + K = 375 \\)\n4. \\( F - G = -177 \\)\n5. \\( A + D = 29 \\)\n6. \\( I - D = 19 \\)\n7. \\( A = 3.0H \\)\n8. \\( F = 3.0B \\)\n9. \\( F + K = 198 \\)\n10. \\( G > C \\)\n11. \\( J - F = 73 \\)\n\nWe can start by solving some of these equations to find relationships between the variables:\n\n- From equation 3: \\( G + K = 375 \\)\n- From equation 2: \\( G = 1.5K \\) implies \\( 1.5K + K = 375 \\) which simplifies to \\( 2.5K = 375 \\) giving \\( K = 150 \\) and \\( G = 225 \\).\n\nNow, let's use these values to find others:\n\n- From equation 9: \\( F + K = 198 \\) and \\( K = 150 \\), so \\( F = 198 - 150 = 48 \\).\n- From equation 4: \\( F - G = -177 \\) and \\( F = 48 \\), so \\( 48 - G = -177 \\) which gives \\( G = 225 \\) (consistent with our earlier calculation).\n- From equation 1: \\( F = 2.4D \\) and \\( F = 48 \\), so \\( 48 = 2.4D \\) which gives \\( D = 20 \\).\n- From equation 5: \\( A + D = 29 \\) and \\( D = 20 \\), so \\( A = 29 - 20 = 9 \\).\n- From equation 6: \\( I - D = 19 \\) and \\( D = 20 \\), so \\( I = 20 + 19 = 39 \\).\n- From equation 7: \\( A = 3.0H \\) and \\( A = 9 \\), so \\( 9 = 3.0H \\) which gives \\( H = 3 \\).\n- From equation 8: \\( F = 3.0B \\) and \\( F = 48 \\), so \\( 48 = 3.0B \\) which gives \\( B = 16 \\).\n- From equation 11: \\( J - F = 73 \\) and \\( F = 48 \\), so \\( J = 48 + 73 = 121 \\).\n\nNow, we have the following assignments:\n- A = 9\n- B = 16\n- D = 20\n- F = 48\n- G = 225\n- H = 3\n- I = 39\n- J = 121\n- K = 150\n\nThe remaining numbers are 75 and 80, which need to be assigned to C and E. From equation 10, \\( G > C \\), and since \\( G = 225 \\), both 75 and 80 satisfy this condition. We can assign:\n- C = 75\n- E = 80\n\nNow, let's verify if all constraints are satisfied with these assignments. If they are, we can return the final answer.\n\n```python\n# Assigning the values based on the reasoning\nA = 9\nB = 16\nC = 75\nD = 20\nE = 80\nF = 48\nG = 225\nH = 3\nI = 39\nJ = 121\nK = 150\n\n# Check all constraints\nconstraints_satisfied = (\n    F == 2.4 * D and\n    G == 1.5 * K and\n    G + K == 375 and\n    F - G == -177 and\n    A + D == 29 and\n    I - D == 19 and\n    A == 3.0 * H and\n    F == 3.0 * B and\n    F + K == 198 and\n    G > C and\n    J - F == 73\n)\n\n# Print the result\nprint([A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K] if constraints_satisfied else \"Constraints not satisfied\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the solution.",
    "The code execution confirms that the assignments satisfy all the given constraints. Therefore, the values for each letter in alphabetical order are:\n\n- A = 9\n- B = 16\n- C = 75\n- D = 20\n- E = 80\n- F = 48\n- G = 225\n- H = 3\n- I = 39\n- J = 121\n- K = 150\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[9, 16, 75, 20, 80, 48, 225, 3, 39, 121, 150]>>>"
