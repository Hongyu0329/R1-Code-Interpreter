    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 1, 3, 4, 9, 16, 27, 36, 80, and 121 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I, respectively, while satisfying the given inequalities and equations.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n\n1. \\( A - D = -77 \\) implies \\( D = A + 77 \\).\n2. \\( H > A \\).\n3. \\( I = 3.0E \\) implies \\( I = 3E \\).\n4. \\( I > B \\).\n5. \\( E - H = -27 \\) implies \\( H = E + 27 \\).\n6. \\( G - A = -2 \\) implies \\( G = A + 2 \\).\n7. \\( H = 4.0E \\) implies \\( H = 4E \\).\n\nFrom constraints 5 and 7, we have:\n- \\( H = E + 27 \\)\n- \\( H = 4E \\)\n\nEquating these, we get:\n\\[ E + 27 = 4E \\]\n\\[ 3E = 27 \\]\n\\[ E = 9 \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( E = 9 \\) into \\( H = 4E \\), we get:\n\\[ H = 4 \\times 9 = 36 \\]\n\nNow, substituting \\( E = 9 \\) into \\( I = 3E \\), we get:\n\\[ I = 3 \\times 9 = 27 \\]\n\nNow, we know:\n- \\( E = 9 \\)\n- \\( H = 36 \\)\n- \\( I = 27 \\)\n\nUsing \\( A - D = -77 \\), we need to find \\( A \\) and \\( D \\) such that \\( D = A + 77 \\). The only possible values for \\( A \\) and \\( D \\) from the list are \\( A = 1 \\) and \\( D = 80 \\).\n\nUsing \\( G - A = -2 \\), we find \\( G = A + 2 \\). With \\( A = 1 \\), \\( G = 3 \\).\n\nNow, we have:\n- \\( A = 1 \\)\n- \\( D = 80 \\)\n- \\( G = 3 \\)\n\nThe remaining numbers are 4, 16, and 121, which need to be assigned to B, C, and F. We know \\( I > B \\), so \\( B \\) must be less than 27. The possible values for \\( B \\) are 4 and 16. Since \\( I = 27 \\), \\( B = 16 \\) is the only possibility.\n\nNow, we have:\n- \\( B = 16 \\)\n\nThe remaining numbers are 4 and 121, which need to be assigned to C and F. Since there are no constraints on C and F, we can assign:\n- \\( C = 4 \\)\n- \\( F = 121 \\)\n\nLet's verify the assignments:\n- \\( A = 1 \\)\n- \\( B = 16 \\)\n- \\( C = 4 \\)\n- \\( D = 80 \\)\n- \\( E = 9 \\)\n- \\( F = 121 \\)\n- \\( G = 3 \\)\n- \\( H = 36 \\)\n- \\( I = 27 \\)\n\nAll constraints are satisfied with these assignments. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[1, 16, 4, 80, 9, 121, 3, 36, 27]>>>"
