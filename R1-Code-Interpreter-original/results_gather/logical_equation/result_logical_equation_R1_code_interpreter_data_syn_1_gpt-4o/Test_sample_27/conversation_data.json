    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 3, 6, 9, 20, 32, 36, 80, 120, and 121 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n\n1. \\( C = 3.0H \\)\n2. \\( A - I = 16 \\)\n3. \\( I - H = 17 \\)\n4. \\( B = 4.0I \\)\n5. \\( E + F = 127 \\)\n6. \\( F - G = -114 \\)\n7. \\( A = 4.0C \\)\n8. \\( B = 2.5D \\)\n\nWe will use these constraints to determine the values of each letter. Let's start by solving the equations step by step:\n\n1. From \\( C = 3.0H \\), we know that C must be a multiple of 3. The possible values for C are 3, 9, 36, 120. However, since C is 3 times H, and the only value that satisfies this condition is C = 9 and H = 3.\n\n2. From \\( I - H = 17 \\), we have \\( I = H + 17 \\). Since H = 3, I = 20.\n\n3. From \\( A - I = 16 \\), we have \\( A = I + 16 \\). Since I = 20, A = 36.\n\n4. From \\( B = 4.0I \\), we have \\( B = 4 \\times 20 = 80 \\).\n\n5. From \\( E + F = 127 \\), we need to find two numbers that sum to 127. The possible pairs are (32, 95) and (36, 91). However, since 36 is already used for A, the only possible pair is (32, 95).\n\n6. From \\( F - G = -114 \\), we have \\( F = G - 114 \\). Since F = 95, G = 95 - 114 = -19, which is not possible. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the possible values for E and F. Let's try E = 32 and F = 95.\n\n7. From \\( A = 4.0C \\), we have \\( A = 4 \\times 9 = 36 \\), which is consistent with our previous calculation.\n\n8. From \\( B = 2.5D \\), we have \\( D = B / 2.5 = 80 / 2.5 = 32 \\).\n\nNow, let's verify the assignments and check if they satisfy all the constraints. We will use Python to automate this process and ensure all constraints are satisfied.\n\n```python\n# Possible values for each letter\nvalues = [3, 6, 9, 20, 32, 36, 80, 120, 121]\n\n# Assign values based on constraints\nA = 36\nB = 80\nC = 9\nD = 32\nE = 32\nF = 95\nG = 9\nH = 3\nI = 20\n\n# Check constraints\nconstraints_satisfied = (\n    C == 3.0 * H and\n    A - I == 16 and\n    I - H == 17 and\n    B == 4.0 * I and\n    E + F == 127 and\n    F - G == -114 and\n    A == 4.0 * C and\n    B == 2.5 * D\n)\n\n# Print the result if all constraints are satisfied\nif constraints_satisfied:\n    print([A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I])\nelse:\n    print(\"Constraints not satisfied\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the solution.",
