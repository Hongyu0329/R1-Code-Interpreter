    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the given numbers to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K such that all the given inequalities are satisfied. We will use a systematic approach to solve this by considering the constraints and using Python to help us find the solution.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n\n1. C + J = 186\n2. H = 3.0F\n3. C - B = -44\n4. E + H = 234\n5. E + I = 130\n6. I - J = -29\n7. D + E = 57\n8. K - B = -64\n9. C + D = 84\n10. B - G = 53\n\nWe have the numbers: 3, 9, 16, 27, 36, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225.\n\nLet's start by solving the equations step by step:\n\n- From equation 3, C = B - 44.\n- From equation 1, J = 186 - C.\n- From equation 6, I = J - 29.\n- From equation 5, E = 130 - I.\n- From equation 4, H = 234 - E.\n- From equation 2, F = H / 3.\n- From equation 7, D = 57 - E.\n- From equation 9, D = 84 - C.\n- From equation 8, K = B - 64.\n- From equation 10, G = B - 53.\n\nWe will use these relationships to find the values of each letter. Let's write a Python script to solve this:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Possible values for the letters\nvalues = [3, 9, 16, 27, 36, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225]\n\n# Iterate over all permutations of the values\nfor perm in permutations(values):\n    A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K = perm\n    \n    # Check all the conditions\n    if (C + J == 186 and\n        H == 3 * F and\n        C - B == -44 and\n        E + H == 234 and\n        E + I == 130 and\n        I - J == -29 and\n        D + E == 57 and\n        K - B == -64 and\n        C + D == 84 and\n        B - G == 53):\n        print([A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K])\n        break\n```\n\nThis code will iterate over all permutations of the given numbers and check if they satisfy all the constraints. Once it finds a valid permutation, it will print the values corresponding to each letter.",
