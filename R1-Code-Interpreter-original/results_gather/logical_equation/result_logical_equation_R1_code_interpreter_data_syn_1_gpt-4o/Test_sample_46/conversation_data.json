    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the given numbers to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K such that all the inequalities are satisfied. The numbers available are 3, 9, 16, 20, 39, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, and 225.\n\nLet's analyze the inequalities:\n\n1. A + F = 196\n2. G - D = -6\n3. G - A = -72\n4. E = 3.0A\n5. B > I\n6. K - A = 75\n7. H - F = -41\n8. B - G = 36\n9. A - H = -5\n10. E - A = 150\n11. H - J = 64\n\nFrom these inequalities, we can derive some relationships:\n\n- From inequality 3, G = A - 72.\n- From inequality 6, K = A + 75.\n- From inequality 10, E = A + 150.\n- From inequality 9, H = A - 5.\n- From inequality 11, J = H - 64 = A - 5 - 64 = A - 69.\n\nNow, let's use these relationships to find the values of the letters. We will use a systematic approach to assign values to the letters and check if they satisfy all the inequalities.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Possible values for the letters\nvalues = [3, 9, 16, 20, 39, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225]\n\n# Iterate over all permutations of the values\nfor perm in permutations(values):\n    A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K = perm\n    \n    # Check all the inequalities\n    if (A + F == 196 and\n        G - D == -6 and\n        G - A == -72 and\n        E == 3.0 * A and\n        B > I and\n        K - A == 75 and\n        H - F == -41 and\n        B - G == 36 and\n        A - H == -5 and\n        E - A == 150 and\n        H - J == 64):\n        print([A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K])\n        break\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the correct assignment of values to the letters.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the correct assignment of values to the letters based on the given inequalities. The list `[75, 39, 48, 9, 225, 121, 3, 80, 20, 16, 150]` corresponds to the values for the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K, respectively.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[75, 39, 48, 9, 225, 121, 3, 80, 20, 16, 150]>>>"
