    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the given numbers to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M such that all the inequalities are satisfied. We will use the constraints provided to narrow down the possibilities and find a consistent assignment.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n\n1. \\( M = 3.0L \\)\n2. \\( F = 2.5H \\)\n3. \\( E - L = 9 \\)\n4. \\( A + I = 60 \\)\n5. \\( E + J = 17 \\)\n6. \\( G - I = 21 \\)\n7. \\( G - A = -9 \\)\n8. \\( E + G = 46 \\)\n9. \\( F + M = 8 \\)\n10. \\( H + I = 17 \\)\n\nWe will use these constraints to find the values of each letter. Let's start by solving the equations step by step:\n\n- From equation 1, \\( M = 3.0L \\), M must be a multiple of 3. The possible values for M are 3, 15, and 45. Correspondingly, L could be 1, 5, or 15.\n- From equation 2, \\( F = 2.5H \\), F must be a multiple of 2.5. The possible values for F are 10, and 15. Correspondingly, H could be 4 or 6.\n- From equation 3, \\( E - L = 9 \\), E must be 9 more than L.\n- From equation 4, \\( A + I = 60 \\), A and I must sum to 60.\n- From equation 5, \\( E + J = 17 \\), J must be 17 minus E.\n- From equation 6, \\( G - I = 21 \\), G must be 21 more than I.\n- From equation 7, \\( G - A = -9 \\), G must be 9 less than A.\n- From equation 8, \\( E + G = 46 \\), G must be 46 minus E.\n- From equation 9, \\( F + M = 8 \\), F and M must sum to 8.\n- From equation 10, \\( H + I = 17 \\), H and I must sum to 17.\n\nLet's use Python to solve this system of equations and find the values for each letter.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Possible values for the letters\nvalues = [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50]\n\n# Iterate over all permutations of the values\nfor perm in permutations(values):\n    A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M = perm\n    \n    # Check all the constraints\n    if (M == 3 * L and\n        F == 2.5 * H and\n        E - L == 9 and\n        A + I == 60 and\n        E + J == 17 and\n        G - I == 21 and\n        G - A == -9 and\n        E + G == 46 and\n        F + M == 8 and\n        H + I == 17):\n        \n        # If all constraints are satisfied, print the result\n        print([A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M])\n        break\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the solution.",
