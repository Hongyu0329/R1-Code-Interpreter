    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the given numbers to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M such that all the inequalities and equations are satisfied. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **A - C = 26**: This implies that A is 26 units greater than C.\n2. **M > L**: M is greater than L.\n3. **C = 2.0D**: C is twice the value of D.\n4. **E + I = 57**: The sum of E and I is 57.\n5. **L = 1.6C**: L is 1.6 times the value of C.\n6. **G - K = -12**: G is 12 units less than K.\n7. **K = 1.5C**: K is 1.5 times the value of C.\n8. **A = 3.6C**: A is 3.6 times the value of C.\n9. **M = 4.8D**: M is 4.8 times the value of D.\n10. **C + F = 106**: The sum of C and F is 106.\n11. **H - G = 42**: H is 42 units greater than G.\n\nGiven the numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, 96, we need to assign them to the letters such that all the above conditions are satisfied.\n\nLet's start by solving the equations involving C and D, as they appear in multiple equations:\n\n- From **C = 2.0D**, we can express D in terms of C: \\( D = \\frac{C}{2} \\).\n- From **A = 3.6C**, we can express A in terms of C: \\( A = 3.6C \\).\n- From **K = 1.5C**, we can express K in terms of C: \\( K = 1.5C \\).\n- From **L = 1.6C**, we can express L in terms of C: \\( L = 1.6C \\).\n- From **M = 4.8D**, and since \\( D = \\frac{C}{2} \\), we have \\( M = 4.8 \\times \\frac{C}{2} = 2.4C \\).\n\nNow, let's use these expressions to find the possible values for C and other variables:\n\n```python\n# Given numbers\nnumbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, 96]\n\n# Function to check if a given assignment satisfies all conditions\ndef check_conditions(assignment):\n    A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M = assignment\n    return (\n        A - C == 26 and\n        M > L and\n        C == 2.0 * D and\n        E + I == 57 and\n        L == 1.6 * C and\n        G - K == -12 and\n        K == 1.5 * C and\n        A == 3.6 * C and\n        M == 4.8 * D and\n        C + F == 106 and\n        H - G == 42\n    )\n\n# Try all permutations of the numbers to find a valid assignment\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nfor perm in permutations(numbers):\n    if check_conditions(perm):\n        print(list(perm))\n        break\n```\n\nThis code will iterate over all permutations of the given numbers and check if they satisfy all the conditions. Once a valid assignment is found, it will print the list of values corresponding to A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M.",
    "The timeout error indicates that the code took too long to execute, likely due to the large number of permutations being checked. To optimize the solution, we can reduce the search space by using the relationships between the variables to directly calculate some values and limit the permutations to a smaller subset of numbers.\n\nLet's focus on the key relationships and solve for C first, as it appears in multiple equations:\n\n1. **A = 3.6C** and **A - C = 26**: From these, we can express A in terms of C and solve for C.\n2. **C = 2.0D**: This gives us D in terms of C.\n3. **K = 1.5C**: This gives us K in terms of C.\n4. **L = 1.6C**: This gives us L in terms of C.\n5. **M = 4.8D**: Since D is in terms of C, M can also be expressed in terms of C.\n\nLet's solve these equations to find the possible value of C and then check the remaining conditions:\n\n```python\n# Given numbers\nnumbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, 96]\n\n# Function to check if a given assignment satisfies all conditions\ndef check_conditions(assignment):\n    A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M = assignment\n    return (\n        A - C == 26 and\n        M > L and\n        C == 2.0 * D and\n        E + I == 57 and\n        L == 1.6 * C and\n        G - K == -12 and\n        K == 1.5 * C and\n        A == 3.6 * C and\n        M == 4.8 * D and\n        C + F == 106 and\n        H - G == 42\n    )\n\n# Calculate possible values for C based on the equations\npossible_C_values = [c for c in numbers if 3.6 * c in numbers and 2.0 * c / 2 in numbers and 1.5 * c in numbers and 1.6 * c in numbers]\n\n# Try permutations of the remaining numbers for the other variables\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nfor C in possible_C_values:\n    A = 3.6 * C\n    D = C / 2\n    K = 1.5 * C\n    L = 1.6 * C\n    M = 4.8 * D\n    remaining_numbers = [n for n in numbers if n not in {A, C, D, K, L, M}]\n    \n    for perm in permutations(remaining_numbers):\n        B, E, F, G, H, I, J = perm\n        if check_conditions([A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M]):\n            print([A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M])\n            break\n```\n\nThis code reduces the number of permutations by pre-calculating possible values for C and directly calculating A, D, K, L, and M based on C. Then, it only permutes the remaining numbers for the other variables. This should significantly reduce the execution time.",
