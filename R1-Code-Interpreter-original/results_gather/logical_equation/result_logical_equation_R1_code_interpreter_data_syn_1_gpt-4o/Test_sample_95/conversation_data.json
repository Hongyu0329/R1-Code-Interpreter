    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the given numbers to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M such that all the inequalities and equations are satisfied. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **D - A = 43**: This implies D = A + 43. Since the largest number is 96, A must be 2, and D must be 45.\n\n2. **F = 1.5C**: F must be 1.5 times C.\n\n3. **A + F = 43**: Since A is 2, F must be 41.\n\n4. **C = 1.6L**: C must be 1.6 times L.\n\n5. **L = 3.0J**: L must be 3 times J.\n\n6. **F - J = 31**: Since F is 41, J must be 10.\n\n7. **H > L**: H must be greater than L.\n\n8. **M = 4.5G**: M must be 4.5 times G.\n\n9. **E + G = 12**: E and G must sum to 12.\n\n10. **J + K = 33**: Since J is 10, K must be 23.\n\n11. **F = 3.6G**: F must be 3.6 times G.\n\n12. **M > A**: M must be greater than A.\n\nNow, let's use these constraints to find the values of each letter. We will use Python to solve this system of equations and inequalities.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbols\nA, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M = symbols('A B C D E F G H I J K L M')\n\n# Define the equations based on the constraints\nequations = [\n    Eq(D, A + 43),\n    Eq(F, 1.5 * C),\n    Eq(A + F, 43),\n    Eq(C, 1.6 * L),\n    Eq(L, 3.0 * J),\n    Eq(F - J, 31),\n    Eq(M, 4.5 * G),\n    Eq(E + G, 12),\n    Eq(J + K, 33),\n    Eq(F, 3.6 * G)\n]\n\n# Solve the equations\nsolution = solve(equations, (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M))\n\n# Extract the solution in alphabetical order\nresult = [solution[A], solution[B], solution[C], solution[D], solution[E], solution[F], solution[G], solution[H], solution[I], solution[J], solution[K], solution[L], solution[M]]\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will solve the system of equations and return the values of the letters in alphabetical order.

    "The error indicates that the solution dictionary does not contain a key for the letter B.
