    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the given numbers to the letters A through M such that all the inequalities and equations are satisfied.

    "The timeout error indicates that the code took too long to execute, likely due to the large number of permutations being checked. To optimize the solution, we can reduce the search space by applying some constraints before iterating over permutations.
