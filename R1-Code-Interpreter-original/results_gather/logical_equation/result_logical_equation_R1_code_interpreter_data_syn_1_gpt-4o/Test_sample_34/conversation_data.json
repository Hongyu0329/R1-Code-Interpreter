    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the given numbers to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K such that all the given inequalities are satisfied. The numbers available are 3, 9, 16, 27, 36, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, and 225.\n\nLet's break down the inequalities and solve them step by step:\n\n1. \\( G = 3.0C \\)\n2. \\( I = 4.0G \\)\n3. \\( A - G = 112 \\)\n4. \\( K = 3.0J \\)\n5. \\( B + D = 64 \\)\n6. \\( E - B = 11 \\)\n7. \\( F = 2.0J \\)\n8. \\( F - C = 147 \\)\n9. \\( E - I = -9 \\)\n10. \\( A + F = 271 \\)\n\nWe will use these equations to find the values of the letters. Let's start by solving the equations that involve fewer variables and then use those solutions to solve the more complex equations.\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n1. **Equation 1 and 2**: \\( G = 3.0C \\) and \\( I = 4.0G \\)\n   - From the list of numbers, we need to find a pair (C, G) such that G is three times C and both are in the list.\n   - Similarly, I should be four times G.\n\n2. **Equation 3**: \\( A - G = 112 \\)\n   - Once G is found, A can be determined.\n\n3. **Equation 4**: \\( K = 3.0J \\)\n   - Find a pair (J, K) such that K is three times J.\n\n4. **Equation 5 and 6**: \\( B + D = 64 \\) and \\( E - B = 11 \\)\n   - These equations can be solved together to find B, D, and E.\n\n5. **Equation 7 and 8**: \\( F = 2.0J \\) and \\( F - C = 147 \\)\n   - These equations can be used to find F and C.\n\n6. **Equation 9**: \\( E - I = -9 \\)\n   - This equation can be used to verify the values of E and I.\n\n7. **Equation 10**: \\( A + F = 271 \\)\n   - This equation can be used to verify the values of A and F.\n\nLet's implement a Python script to find the correct assignment of numbers to letters.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Given numbers\nnumbers = [3, 9, 16, 27, 36, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225]\n\n# Iterate over all permutations of the numbers\nfor perm in permutations(numbers):\n    A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K = perm\n    \n    # Check all conditions\n    if (G == 3 * C and\n        I == 4 * G and\n        A - G == 112 and\n        K == 3 * J and\n        B + D == 64 and\n        E - B == 11 and\n        F == 2 * J and\n        F - C == 147 and\n        E - I == -9 and\n        A + F == 271):\n        result = [A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K]\n        break\n\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis script will iterate over all permutations of the given numbers and check if they satisfy all the given inequalities. Once a valid permutation is found, it will print the result. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code has successfully found a permutation of the numbers that satisfies all the given inequalities. The output list represents the values assigned to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K in alphabetical order.\n\nThe solution is:\n- A = 121\n- B = 16\n- C = 3\n- D = 48\n- E = 27\n- F = 150\n- G = 9\n- H = 80\n- I = 36\n- J = 75\n- K = 225\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[121, 16, 3, 48, 27, 150, 9, 80, 36, 75, 225]>>>"
