    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 3, 6, 9, 20, 32, 36, 80, 120, and 121 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities.\n\nLet's break down the inequalities and solve them step by step:\n\n1. **B + I = 156**: This implies that B and I must be two numbers from the list that add up to 156.\n2. **B + D = 123**: This implies that B and D must be two numbers from the list that add up to 123.\n3. **D - A = -29**: This implies that A = D + 29.\n4. **G = 2.0D**: This implies that G is twice the value of D.\n5. **B = 1.5C**: This implies that B is 1.5 times the value of C.\n6. **A > D**: This is consistent with inequality 3 since A = D + 29.\n7. **A - I = -4**: This implies that A = I + 4.\n8. **C - F = 71**: This implies that C is 71 more than F.\n\nNow, let's use these constraints to find the values of each letter. We will use Python to help us find the correct assignment of numbers to letters.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Possible values for the letters\nvalues = [3, 6, 9, 20, 32, 36, 80, 120, 121]\n\n# Iterate over all permutations of the values\nfor perm in permutations(values):\n    A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I = perm\n    \n    # Check all the conditions\n    if (B + I == 156 and\n        B + D == 123 and\n        D - A == -29 and\n        G == 2.0 * D and\n        B == 1.5 * C and\n        A > D and\n        A - I == -4 and\n        C - F == 71):\n        print([A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I])\n        break\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the solution.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the values for each letter based on the given constraints. The output list `[32, 120, 80, 3, 20, 9, 6, 121, 36]` corresponds to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I, respectively.\n\nTherefore, the values for each letter are:\n- A = 32\n- B = 120\n- C = 80\n- D = 3\n- E = 20\n- F = 9\n- G = 6\n- H = 121\n- I = 36\n\nThe final answer, in alphabetical order starting with A, is:\n\n<<<[32, 120, 80, 3, 20, 9, 6, 121, 36]>>>"
