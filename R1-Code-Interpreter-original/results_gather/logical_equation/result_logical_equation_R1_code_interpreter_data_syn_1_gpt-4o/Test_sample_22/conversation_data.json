    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 3, 6, 9, 20, 32, 36, 80, 120, and 121 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n\n1. \\( B = 2.0G \\)\n2. \\( I = 2.5F \\)\n3. \\( B + I = 86 \\)\n4. \\( A + G = 12 \\)\n5. \\( I > F \\)\n6. \\( F + I = 112 \\)\n7. \\( C + H = 140 \\)\n8. \\( A - H = -11 \\)\n\nWe will use these constraints to determine the values of each letter. Let's start by solving the equations and inequalities step by step:\n\n- From equation 6, \\( F + I = 112 \\), and equation 2, \\( I = 2.5F \\), we can substitute to find \\( F \\) and \\( I \\).\n- From equation 1, \\( B = 2.0G \\), we can find \\( B \\) once we know \\( G \\).\n- From equation 3, \\( B + I = 86 \\), we can use the values of \\( B \\) and \\( I \\) to check consistency.\n- From equation 4, \\( A + G = 12 \\), we can find \\( A \\) once we know \\( G \\).\n- From equation 8, \\( A - H = -11 \\), we can find \\( H \\) once we know \\( A \\).\n- From equation 7, \\( C + H = 140 \\), we can find \\( C \\) once we know \\( H \\).\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the values of each letter.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Possible values for the letters\nvalues = [3, 6, 9, 20, 32, 36, 80, 120, 121]\n\n# Iterate over all permutations of the values\nfor perm in permutations(values):\n    A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I = perm\n    \n    # Check all conditions\n    if (B == 2.0 * G and\n        I == 2.5 * F and\n        B + I == 86 and\n        A + G == 12 and\n        I > F and\n        F + I == 112 and\n        C + H == 140 and\n        A - H == -11):\n        print([A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I])\n        break\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the solution.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the values for each letter based on the given constraints. The output list corresponds to the values of the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I in that order.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the problem is:\n\n- A = 9\n- B = 6\n- C = 120\n- D = 36\n- E = 121\n- F = 32\n- G = 3\n- H = 20\n- I = 80\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[9, 6, 120, 36, 121, 32, 3, 20, 80]>>>"
