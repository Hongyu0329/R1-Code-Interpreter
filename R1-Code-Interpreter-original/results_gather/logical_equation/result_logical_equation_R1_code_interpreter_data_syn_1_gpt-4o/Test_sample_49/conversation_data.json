    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the correct values to each letter based on the given inequalities and equations. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the possible values for each letter**: The numbers given are 3, 9, 16, 20, 39, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225.\n\n2. **Analyze the equations and inequalities**:\n   - A + I = 300\n   - E = 2.4C\n   - G = 3.0K\n   - J > A\n   - A - G = 66\n   - J = 4.0C\n   - I = 3.0A\n   - F = 2.0A\n   - I = 1.5F\n   - A - C = 55\n   - H - A = -59\n\n3. **Start solving the equations**:\n   - From equation 7: I = 3.0A\n   - From equation 1: A + I = 300, substituting I = 3.0A gives A + 3.0A = 300, so 4A = 300, thus A = 75.\n   - Substituting A = 75 into I = 3.0A gives I = 225.\n   - From equation 5: A - G = 66, substituting A = 75 gives 75 - G = 66, so G = 9.\n   - From equation 3: G = 3.0K, substituting G = 9 gives 9 = 3.0K, so K = 3.\n   - From equation 8: F = 2.0A, substituting A = 75 gives F = 150.\n   - From equation 9: I = 1.5F, substituting I = 225 gives 225 = 1.5F, so F = 150 (consistent with equation 8).\n   - From equation 10: A - C = 55, substituting A = 75 gives 75 - C = 55, so C = 20.\n   - From equation 2: E = 2.4C, substituting C = 20 gives E = 48.\n   - From equation 6: J = 4.0C, substituting C = 20 gives J = 80.\n   - From equation 4: J > A, substituting J = 80 and A = 75 is consistent.\n   - From equation 11: H - A = -59, substituting A = 75 gives H - 75 = -59, so H = 16.\n\n4. **Assign the remaining value**:\n   - The only number left is 39, which must be assigned to B.\n\nNow, let's verify the solution by checking if all equations and inequalities are satisfied with these assignments. If they are, we can conclude that the solution is correct.\n\nLet's write a Python script to verify the solution:\n\n```python\n# Assign values to letters\nA = 75\nB = 39\nC = 20\nD = None  # D is not involved in any equation, so it can be any unused number\nE = 48\nF = 150\nG = 9\nH = 16\nI = 225\nJ = 80\nK = 3\n\n# Check all equations and inequalities\nequations_satisfied = (\n    A + I == 300,\n    E == 2.4 * C,\n    G == 3.0 * K,\n    J > A,\n    A - G == 66,\n    J == 4.0 * C,\n    I == 3.0 * A,\n    F == 2.0 * A,\n    I == 1.5 * F,\n    A - C == 55,\n    H - A == -59\n)\n\n# Check if all equations are satisfied\nall_satisfied = all(equations_satisfied)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(all_satisfied)\n```\n\nIf the script returns `True`, it means all equations and inequalities are satisfied with the assigned values. Let's execute the code to verify.",
    "The code output `True` indicates that all the equations and inequalities are satisfied with the assigned values. Therefore, the solution is correct. The values for each letter, in alphabetical order, are:\n\n- A = 75\n- B = 39\n- C = 20\n- D = 3 (since D is not involved in any equation, it can be any unused number)\n- E = 48\n- F = 150\n- G = 9\n- H = 16\n- I = 225\n- J = 80\n- K = 3\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[75, 39, 20, 3, 48, 150, 9, 16, 225, 80, 3]>>>"
