    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 3, 9, 16, 20, 39, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, and 225 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K, respectively, while satisfying the given inequalities and equations.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n\n1. H > G\n2. H + K = 273\n3. B - F = 60\n4. K - B = 145\n5. F - I = 11\n6. D - E = -59\n7. B = 4.0F\n8. G + H = 51\n9. K = 3.0E\n10. C + K = 264\n11. I = 3.0G\n\nWe can use these constraints to deduce the values step by step:\n\n- From constraint 7, B = 4.0F, we can deduce that B must be 4 times F.\n- From constraint 3, B - F = 60, we can deduce that B = F + 60.\n- Combining these two, we get F + 60 = 4F, which simplifies to 3F = 60, so F = 20 and B = 80.\n- From constraint 4, K - B = 145, we get K = 225.\n- From constraint 9, K = 3.0E, we get E = 75.\n- From constraint 6, D - E = -59, we get D = 16.\n- From constraint 10, C + K = 264, we get C = 39.\n- From constraint 2, H + K = 273, we get H = 48.\n- From constraint 8, G + H = 51, we get G = 3.\n- From constraint 11, I = 3.0G, we get I = 9.\n- From constraint 5, F - I = 11, we already have F = 20 and I = 9, which satisfies this constraint.\n\nNow, we have the following assignments:\n- A = 150 (the only number left)\n- B = 80\n- C = 39\n- D = 16\n- E = 75\n- F = 20\n- G = 3\n- H = 48\n- I = 9\n- J = 121 (the only number left)\n- K = 225\n\nLet's verify these assignments with a Python script to ensure all constraints are satisfied.\n\n```python\n# Assign the numbers to the letters\nA, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K = 150, 80, 39, 16, 75, 20, 3, 48, 9, 121, 225\n\n# Check all constraints\nconstraints_satisfied = (\n    H > G and\n    H + K == 273 and\n    B - F == 60 and\n    K - B == 145 and\n    F - I == 11 and\n    D - E == -59 and\n    B == 4.0 * F and\n    G + H == 51 and\n    K == 3.0 * E and\n    C + K == 264 and\n    I == 3.0 * G\n)\n\nprint(constraints_satisfied)\nprint([A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K])\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the solution.",
