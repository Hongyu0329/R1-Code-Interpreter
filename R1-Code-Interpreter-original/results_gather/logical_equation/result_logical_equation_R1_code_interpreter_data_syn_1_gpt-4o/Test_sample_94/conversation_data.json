    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, 96 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M such that all the given inequalities and equations are satisfied.\n\nLet's break down the constraints and solve them step by step:\n\n1. **G + I = 55**: This means G and I must be two numbers from the list that add up to 55.\n2. **E > D**: E must be greater than D.\n3. **G + L = 57**: G and L must be two numbers from the list that add up to 57.\n4. **G - E = 5**: E is 5 less than G.\n5. **C + H = 27**: C and H must be two numbers from the list that add up to 27.\n6. **A - I = 5**: A is 5 more than I.\n7. **F - I = 91**: F is 91 more than I.\n8. **B - C = -9**: C is 9 more than B.\n9. **K > C**: K must be greater than C.\n10. **H + L = 10**: H and L must be two numbers from the list that add up to 10.\n11. **J - D = 14**: J is 14 more than D.\n12. **B - F = -81**: F is 81 more than B.\n\nWe will use these constraints to find the values of each letter. Let's start by writing a Python script to solve this system of equations and inequalities.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Possible values for the letters\nvalues = [2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, 96]\n\n# Iterate over all permutations of the values\nfor perm in permutations(values):\n    A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M = perm\n    \n    # Check all the conditions\n    if (G + I == 55 and\n        E > D and\n        G + L == 57 and\n        G - E == 5 and\n        C + H == 27 and\n        A - I == 5 and\n        F - I == 91 and\n        B - C == -9 and\n        K > C and\n        H + L == 10 and\n        J - D == 14 and\n        B - F == -81):\n        \n        # If all conditions are satisfied, print the result\n        print([A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M])\n        break\n```\n\nThis code will iterate over all permutations of the given numbers and check if they satisfy all the given conditions. Once it finds a valid permutation, it will print the result. Let's execute this code to find the solution.",
    "The timeout error indicates that the code took too long to execute, likely due to the large number of permutations (13! = 6,227,020,800 permutations). To address this, we can optimize the code by reducing the search space using the constraints more effectively. Let's try to solve the problem by narrowing down the possibilities before iterating over permutations.\n\n1. **G + I = 55**: We can find pairs of numbers that add up to 55.\n2. **G - E = 5**: This implies E = G - 5.\n3. **G + L = 57**: This implies L = 57 - G.\n4. **F - I = 91**: This implies F = I + 91.\n5. **B - C = -9**: This implies B = C - 9.\n6. **H + L = 10**: This implies L = 10 - H.\n\nLet's use these constraints to reduce the number of permutations we need to check.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Possible values for the letters\nvalues = [2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, 96]\n\n# Pre-calculate possible pairs for G and I\npossible_g_i_pairs = [(g, i) for g in values for i in values if g + i == 55]\n\n# Iterate over possible G and I pairs\nfor G, I in possible_g_i_pairs:\n    E = G - 5\n    L = 57 - G\n    F = I + 91\n    \n    # Check if E, L, F are in the list of values\n    if E in values and L in values and F in values:\n        # Remove G, I, E, L, F from the list of values\n        remaining_values = [v for v in values if v not in {G, I, E, L, F}]\n        \n        # Iterate over permutations of the remaining values\n        for perm in permutations(remaining_values):\n            A, B, C, D, H, J, K, M = perm\n            \n            # Check all the conditions\n            if (E > D and\n                C + H == 27 and\n                A - I == 5 and\n                B - C == -9 and\n                K > C and\n                H + L == 10 and\n                J - D == 14 and\n                B - F == -81):\n                \n                # If all conditions are satisfied, print the result\n                print([A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M])\n                break\n```\n\nThis code reduces the number of permutations by pre-calculating possible values for G, I, E, L, and F based on the constraints.
