    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the given numbers to the letters A through M such that all the given inequalities are satisfied. Let's break down the problem and solve it step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the given numbers**: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50.\n\n2. **List the inequalities**:\n   - F + H = 6\n   - E = 2.4D\n   - B = 2.0F\n   - C = 3.0M\n   - I - B = 34\n   - H = 2.5B\n   - E + M = 39\n   - L = 4.0J\n   - M = 3.0H\n   - L = 2.8D\n\n3. **Analyze the constraints**:\n   - From F + H = 6, F and H must be small numbers.\n   - From B = 2.0F, B must be twice F.\n   - From I - B = 34, I must be much larger than B.\n   - From H = 2.5B, H must be 2.5 times B.\n   - From M = 3.0H, M must be three times H.\n   - From L = 4.0J, L must be four times J.\n   - From L = 2.8D, L must be 2.8 times D.\n\n4. **Solve the equations**:\n   - Start with F + H = 6. Possible pairs (F, H) are (1, 5) and (2, 4).\n   - If F = 2, then B = 4, and H = 4. But H = 2.5B = 10, which is not possible.\n   - If F = 1, then B = 2, and H = 5. H = 2.5B = 5, which is possible.\n   - M = 3.0H = 15.\n   - C = 3.0M = 45.\n   - I = B + 34 = 36.\n   - E + M = 39, so E = 24.\n   - E = 2.4D, so D = 10.\n   - L = 2.8D = 28.\n   - L = 4.0J, so J = 7.\n\n5. **Assign the remaining numbers**:\n   - The remaining numbers are 3, 16, and 50.\n   - A, G, and K are left. Assign them to 3, 16, and 50.\n\nLet's write a Python script to verify these assignments and ensure all constraints are satisfied.\n\n```python\n# Assign the numbers to the letters based on the reasoning above\nA = 3\nB = 2\nC = 45\nD = 10\nE = 24\nF = 1\nG = 16\nH = 5\nI = 36\nJ = 7\nK = 50\nL = 28\nM = 15\n\n# Verify the constraints\nconstraints_satisfied = (\n    F + H == 6 and\n    E == 2.4 * D and\n    B == 2.0 * F and\n    C == 3.0 * M and\n    I - B == 34 and\n    H == 2.5 * B and\n    E + M == 39 and\n    L == 4.0 * J and\n    M == 3.0 * H and\n    L == 2.8 * D\n)\n\n# Print the result if all constraints are satisfied\nif constraints_satisfied:\n    print([A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M])\nelse:\n    print(\"Constraints not satisfied\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the solution.",
