    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, 96 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M such that all the given inequalities and equations are satisfied.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **C + E = 141**: This implies that C and E must be two numbers from the list that add up to 141. The only possible pair is (45, 96) or (96, 45).\n\n2. **E - C = 51**: This implies E is greater than C by 51. So, E = 96 and C = 45.\n\n3. **J + L = 33**: J and L must be two numbers from the list that add up to 33. The only possible pair is (3, 30) or (30, 3), but since 30 is not in the list, we need to find another pair. The correct pair is (3, 30) but since 30 is not in the list, we need to find another pair.
