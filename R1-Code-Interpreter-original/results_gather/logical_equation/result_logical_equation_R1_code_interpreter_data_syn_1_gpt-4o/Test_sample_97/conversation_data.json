    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the given numbers to the letters A through M such that all the inequalities are satisfied. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the given numbers**: 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, 96.\n\n2. **Analyze the inequalities**:\n   - A - L = -5 implies L = A + 5.\n   - I = 3.2C.\n   - J + M = 60.\n   - L + M = 31.\n   - C = 2.5A.\n   - L = 3.5A.\n   - D = 4.0M.\n   - B = 4.5G.\n   - I + M = 40.\n   - A + D = 98.\n   - F = 1.5G.\n   - D + G = 106.\n\n3. **Substitute and solve**:\n   - From L = 3.5A and L = A + 5, we get 3.5A = A + 5, which simplifies to 2.5A = 5, so A = 2.\n   - Substitute A = 2 into C = 2.5A, we get C = 5.\n   - Substitute A = 2 into L = A + 5, we get L = 7.\n   - Substitute A = 2 into L = 3.5A, we get L = 7 (consistent).\n   - Substitute C = 5 into I = 3.2C, we get I = 16.\n   - Substitute L = 7 into L + M = 31, we get M = 24.\n   - Substitute M = 24 into J + M = 60, we get J = 36.\n   - Substitute M = 24 into D = 4.0M, we get D = 96.\n   - Substitute A = 2 and D = 96 into A + D = 98, which is consistent.\n   - Substitute M = 24 and I = 16 into I + M = 40, which is consistent.\n   - Substitute D = 96 into D + G = 106, we get G = 10.\n   - Substitute G = 10 into B = 4.5G, we get B = 45.\n   - Substitute G = 10 into F = 1.5G, we get F = 15.\n\n4. **Assign the remaining numbers**:\n   - The numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, 96 have been used for A, C, L, G, F, I, M, J, B, D respectively.\n   - The remaining numbers are 3, 28, 50.\n   - H and K are left. Assign H = 3 and K = 28.\n\nNow, let's verify the assignments and ensure all inequalities are satisfied. We will write a Python script to check the assignments and verify the inequalities.\n\n```python\n# Assign values to letters\nA = 2\nB = 45\nC = 5\nD = 96\nE = 50\nF = 15\nG = 10\nH = 3\nI = 16\nJ = 36\nK = 28\nL = 7\nM = 24\n\n# Verify inequalities\ninequalities = [\n    A - L == -5,\n    I == 3.2 * C,\n    J + M == 60,\n    L + M == 31,\n    C == 2.5 * A,\n    L == 3.5 * A,\n    D == 4.0 * M,\n    B == 4.5 * G,\n    I + M == 40,\n    A + D == 98,\n    F == 1.5 * G,\n    D + G == 106\n]\n\n# Check if all inequalities are satisfied\nall_satisfied = all(inequalities)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(all_satisfied)\n```\n\nLet's execute the code to verify the solution.",
    "The code output indicates that all the inequalities are satisfied with the assigned values. Therefore, the solution is correct. The values for each letter, in alphabetical order, are:\n\n- A = 2\n- B = 45\n- C = 5\n- D = 96\n- E = 50\n- F = 15\n- G = 10\n- H = 3\n- I = 16\n- J = 36\n- K = 28\n- L = 7\n- M = 24\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[2, 45, 5, 96, 50, 15, 10, 3, 16, 36, 28, 7, 24]>>>"
