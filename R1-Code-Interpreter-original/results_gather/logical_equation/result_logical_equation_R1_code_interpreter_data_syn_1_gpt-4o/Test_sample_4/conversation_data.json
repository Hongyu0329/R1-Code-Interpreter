    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 1, 3, 4, 9, 16, 27, 36, 80, and 121 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities.\n\nLet's break down the inequalities and solve them step by step:\n\n1. **C - E = -5**: This implies C = E - 5.\n2. **D - F = 79**: This implies D = F + 79.\n3. **G = 4.0E**: This implies G = 4 * E.\n4. **H = 4.0C**: This implies H = 4 * C.\n5. **E - G = -27**: This implies E = G - 27.\n6. **E + H = 25**: This implies H = 25 - E.\n7. **A + H = 137**: This implies A = 137 - H.\n\nWe can use these equations to find the values of the letters. Let's start by solving the equations involving E and G:\n\nFrom equation 3 and 5:\n- G = 4 * E\n- E = G - 27\n\nSubstituting G = 4 * E into E = G - 27 gives:\nE = 4 * E - 27\n3 * E = 27\nE = 9\n\nNow, substituting E = 9 into G = 4 * E:\nG = 4 * 9 = 36\n\nNow, let's solve for C using equation 1:\nC = E - 5 = 9 - 5 = 4\n\nNext, solve for H using equation 4:\nH = 4 * C = 4 * 4 = 16\n\nNow, solve for A using equation 7:\nA = 137 - H = 137 - 16 = 121\n\nNow, solve for D and F using equation 2:\nSince D - F = 79, and we have the numbers 1, 3, 4, 9, 16, 27, 36, 80, 121, the only possible values for D and F that satisfy this equation are D = 80 and F = 1.\n\nNow, we have the following assignments:\n- A = 121\n- C = 4\n- D = 80\n- E = 9\n- F = 1\n- G = 36\n- H = 16\n\nThe remaining numbers are 3 and 27, which must be assigned to B and I. Since there are no constraints on B and I, we can assign them as follows:\n- B = 3\n- I = 27\n\nLet's verify these assignments satisfy all the inequalities:\n1. C - E = 4 - 9 = -5 (satisfied)\n2. D - F = 80 - 1 = 79 (satisfied)\n3. G = 4.0E = 4 * 9 = 36 (satisfied)\n4. H = 4.0C = 4 * 4 = 16 (satisfied)\n5. E - G = 9 - 36 = -27 (satisfied)\n6. E + H = 9 + 16 = 25 (satisfied)\n7. A + H = 121 + 16 = 137 (satisfied)\n\nAll inequalities are satisfied, so the assignments are correct.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<[121, 3, 4, 80, 9, 1, 36, 16, 27]>>>"
