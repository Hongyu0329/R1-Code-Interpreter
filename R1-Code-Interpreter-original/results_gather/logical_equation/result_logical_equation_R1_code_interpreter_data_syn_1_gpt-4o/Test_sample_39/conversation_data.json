    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the given numbers to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K such that all the inequalities are satisfied. The numbers are 3, 9, 16, 27, 36, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225.\n\nLet's break down the inequalities and solve them step by step:\n\n1. \\( K - H = -150 \\) implies \\( K = H - 150 \\).\n2. \\( G - K = 46 \\) implies \\( G = K + 46 \\).\n3. \\( B - F = 70 \\) implies \\( B = F + 70 \\).\n4. \\( K - A = 59 \\) implies \\( A = K - 59 \\).\n5. \\( H = 3.0K \\) implies \\( H = 3K \\).\n6. \\( C + H = 252 \\) implies \\( C = 252 - H \\).\n7. \\( D = 4.0I \\) implies \\( D = 4I \\).\n8. \\( C + F = 107 \\) implies \\( F = 107 - C \\).\n9. \\( J - B = -102 \\) implies \\( J = B - 102 \\).\n10. \\( G - I = 112 \\) implies \\( I = G - 112 \\).\n\nWe will use these equations to find the values of the letters. Let's write a Python script to solve this system of equations.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbols\nA, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K = symbols('A B C D E F G H I J K')\n\n# Define the equations based on the inequalities\neq1 = Eq(K - H, -150)\neq2 = Eq(G - K, 46)\neq3 = Eq(B - F, 70)\neq4 = Eq(K - A, 59)\neq5 = Eq(H, 3 * K)\neq6 = Eq(C + H, 252)\neq7 = Eq(D, 4 * I)\neq8 = Eq(C + F, 107)\neq9 = Eq(J - B, -102)\neq10 = Eq(G - I, 112)\n\n# List of possible values\nvalues = [3, 9, 16, 27, 36, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225]\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2, eq3, eq4, eq5, eq6, eq7, eq8, eq9, eq10), (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K))\n\n# Filter the solution to match the possible values\nfinal_solution = {var: val for var, val in solution.items() if val in values}\n\n# Sort the solution by the variable names\nsorted_solution = [final_solution[var] for var in sorted(final_solution)]\n\nprint(sorted_solution)\n```\n\nThis script will solve the system of equations and filter the solutions to match the given possible values.

    "The error indicates that the solution contains relational expressions that cannot be directly evaluated to a boolean value. This typically happens when the solution is not fully numeric or when the solution set includes symbolic expressions.\n\nTo address this, we need to ensure that the solution is fully numeric and matches the given set of possible values. Let's modify the code to check each possible combination of values for the variables and see if they satisfy all the equations.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Define the possible values\nvalues = [3, 9, 16, 27, 36, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225]\n\n# Iterate over all permutations of the values\nfor perm in permutations(values):\n    A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K = perm\n    \n    # Check if the current permutation satisfies all the equations\n    if (K - H == -150 and\n        G - K == 46 and\n        B - F == 70 and\n        K - A == 59 and\n        H == 3 * K and\n        C + H == 252 and\n        D == 4 * I and\n        C + F == 107 and\n        J - B == -102 and\n        G - I == 112):\n        \n        # If all conditions are satisfied, print the solution\n        solution = [A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K]\n        break\n\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code will try all permutations of the given values and check if they satisfy all the equations. Once a valid solution is found, it will print the solution. Let's execute this code to find the correct assignment of values to the letters.",
