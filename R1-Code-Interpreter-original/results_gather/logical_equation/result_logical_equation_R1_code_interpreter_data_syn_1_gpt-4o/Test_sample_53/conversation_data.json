    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the given numbers to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K such that all the given inequalities are satisfied. The numbers available are 3, 9, 16, 20, 39, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, and 225.\n\nLet's break down the constraints and solve them step by step:\n\n1. F - K = 36\n2. B - K = 111\n3. B + E = 230\n4. H + J = 25\n5. E - A = 77\n6. H + I = 36\n7. C + E = 305\n8. C - I = 205\n9. C + J = 234\n10. G = 3.0H\n11. A + K = 42\n\nWe will use these constraints to deduce the values of each letter. Let's start by solving the equations that involve fewer variables and use them to find the others.\n\nFirst, let's solve the equations that involve only two variables:\n\n- From equation 1: F = K + 36\n- From equation 2: B = K + 111\n- From equation 5: E = A + 77\n- From equation 11: A = 42 - K\n\nNow, let's substitute these into the other equations and solve for the values:\n\n- From equation 3: B + E = 230\n  - Substitute B = K + 111 and E = A + 77\n  - K + 111 + A + 77 = 230\n  - K + A = 42 (which is consistent with equation 11)\n\n- From equation 4: H + J = 25\n- From equation 6: H + I = 36\n- From equation 7: C + E = 305\n  - Substitute E = A + 77\n  - C + A + 77 = 305\n  - C + A = 228\n\n- From equation 8: C - I = 205\n- From equation 9: C + J = 234\n- From equation 10: G = 3.0H\n\nNow, let's use these equations to find the values of the letters. We will use Python to solve this system of equations.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbols\nA, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K = symbols('A B C D E F G H I J K')\n\n# Define the equations\neq1 = Eq(F - K, 36)\neq2 = Eq(B - K, 111)\neq3 = Eq(B + E, 230)\neq4 = Eq(H + J, 25)\neq5 = Eq(E - A, 77)\neq6 = Eq(H + I, 36)\neq7 = Eq(C + E, 305)\neq8 = Eq(C - I, 205)\neq9 = Eq(C + J, 234)\neq10 = Eq(G, 3 * H)\neq11 = Eq(A + K, 42)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2, eq3, eq4, eq5, eq6, eq7, eq8, eq9, eq10, eq11), (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K))\n\n# Extract the values in alphabetical order\nresult = [solution[A], solution[B], solution[C], solution[D], solution[E], solution[F], solution[G], solution[H], solution[I], solution[J], solution[K]]\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the values of each letter.",
    "The error indicates that the variable `D` is not part of the solution set, which makes sense because there is no equation involving `D`. Let's remove `D` from the list of variables and solve the system again. \n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the symbols\nA, B, C, E, F, G, H, I, J, K = symbols('A B C E F G H I J K')\n\n# Define the equations\neq1 = Eq(F - K, 36)\neq2 = Eq(B - K, 111)\neq3 = Eq(B + E, 230)\neq4 = Eq(H + J, 25)\neq5 = Eq(E - A, 77)\neq6 = Eq(H + I, 36)\neq7 = Eq(C + E, 305)\neq8 = Eq(C - I, 205)\neq9 = Eq(C + J, 234)\neq10 = Eq(G, 3 * H)\neq11 = Eq(A + K, 42)\n\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = solve((eq1, eq2, eq3, eq4, eq5, eq6, eq7, eq8, eq9, eq10, eq11), (A, B, C, E, F, G, H, I, J, K))\n\n# Extract the values in alphabetical order\nresult = [solution[A], solution[B], solution[C], solution[E], solution[F], solution[G], solution[H], solution[I], solution[J], solution[K]]\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the values of each letter.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the values for each letter, except for `D`, which was not part of any equation. The values are in alphabetical order, corresponding to the letters A, B, C, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K. Since `D` is not involved in any constraints, it must be assigned the remaining number from the list of available numbers.\n\nThe available numbers are: 3, 9, 16, 20, 39, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, and 225. The numbers used in the solution are 3, 150, 225, 80, 75, 48, 16, 20, 9, and 39. The only number not used is 121, which must be assigned to `D`.\n\nThus, the final values for the letters A through K are:\n\n- A = 3\n- B = 150\n- C = 225\n- D = 121\n- E = 80\n- F = 75\n- G = 48\n- H = 16\n- I = 20\n- J = 9\n- K = 39\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<[3, 150, 225, 121, 80, 75, 48, 16, 20, 9, 39]>>>"
