    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the given numbers to the letters A through M such that all the inequalities are satisfied. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **List of numbers**: 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, 96.\n2. **Inequalities**:\n   - K - G = 25\n   - F = 3.5M\n   - B + E = 141\n   - J + K = 38\n   - B + I = 50\n   - A - G = 33\n   - I + M = 7\n   - A - H = -14\n   - M - H = -48\n   - C - E = -72\n   - F = 1.4I\n\nLet's start by solving the inequalities step by step:\n\n- From inequality 7 (I + M = 7), since the smallest numbers are 2, 3, 5, and 7, the only possible values for I and M are 2 and 5, respectively.\n- From inequality 9 (M - H = -48), we have M = 5, so H = 53. However, 53 is not in the list, so let's re-evaluate. If M = 2, then H = 50.\n- From inequality 8 (A - H = -14), we have H = 50, so A = 36.\n- From inequality 6 (A - G = 33), we have A = 36, so G = 3.\n- From inequality 1 (K - G = 25), we have G = 3, so K = 28.\n- From inequality 4 (J + K = 38), we have K = 28, so J = 10.\n- From inequality 3 (B + E = 141), the possible values for B and E are 45 and 96.\n- From inequality 5 (B + I = 50), we have I = 2, so B = 48. However, 48 is not in the list, so B = 45 and I = 5.\n- From inequality 10 (C - E = -72), we have E = 96, so C = 24.\n- From inequality 2 (F = 3.5M), we have M = 2, so F = 7.\n- From inequality 11 (F = 1.4I), we have I = 5, so F = 7.\n\nNow, let's assign the remaining numbers to the letters:\n\n- A = 36\n- B = 45\n- C = 24\n- D = 16 (remaining number)\n- E = 96\n- F = 7\n- G = 3\n- H = 50\n- I = 5\n- J = 10\n- K = 28\n- L = 15 (remaining number)\n- M = 2\n\nLet's verify the solution by checking all inequalities:\n\n- K - G = 28 - 3 = 25 (satisfied)\n- F = 3.5M = 3.5 * 2 = 7 (satisfied)\n- B + E = 45 + 96 = 141 (satisfied)\n- J + K = 10 + 28 = 38 (satisfied)\n- B + I = 45 + 5 = 50 (satisfied)\n- A - G = 36 - 3 = 33 (satisfied)\n- I + M = 5 + 2 = 7 (satisfied)\n- A - H = 36 - 50 = -14 (satisfied)\n- M - H = 2 - 50 = -48 (satisfied)\n- C - E = 24 - 96 = -72 (satisfied)\n- F = 1.4I = 1.4 * 5 = 7 (satisfied)\n\nAll inequalities are satisfied. Now, let's return the final answer in alphabetical order:\n\n<<<[36, 45, 24, 16, 96, 7, 3, 50, 5, 10, 28, 15, 2]>>>"
