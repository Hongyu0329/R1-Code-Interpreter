    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the given numbers to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K such that all the given inequalities are satisfied. The numbers available are 3, 9, 16, 27, 36, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, and 225.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n\n1. H + J = 130\n2. C + I = 177\n3. C + G = 75\n4. G = 3.0F\n5. B - E = 150\n6. J - C = -18\n7. E + G = 123\n8. D + F = 96\n9. E + K = 78\n10. H + K = 124\n\nWe can start by analyzing the constraints to find relationships between the variables:\n\n- From constraint 4, G = 3F, we can deduce that G must be 3 times F. The only pair of numbers that satisfy this condition from the list is G = 75 and F = 25.\n- From constraint 3, C + G = 75, and knowing G = 75, we find C = 0, which is not possible since 0 is not in the list. So, we need to re-evaluate.\n- From constraint 5, B - E = 150, B must be 150 more than E. The only pair that satisfies this is B = 225 and E = 75.\n- From constraint 7, E + G = 123, and knowing E = 75, we find G = 48.\n- From constraint 4, G = 3F, and knowing G = 48, we find F = 16.\n- From constraint 8, D + F = 96, and knowing F = 16, we find D = 80.\n- From constraint 6, J - C = -18, we can express J = C - 18.\n- From constraint 1, H + J = 130, we can express H = 130 - J.\n- From constraint 2, C + I = 177, we can express I = 177 - C.\n- From constraint 9, E + K = 78, and knowing E = 75, we find K = 3.\n- From constraint 10, H + K = 124, and knowing K = 3, we find H = 121.\n\nNow, let's use these deductions to find the values of the remaining variables using Python code:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Given numbers\nnumbers = [3, 9, 16, 27, 36, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225]\n\n# Constraints\ndef check_constraints(values):\n    A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K = values\n    return (\n        H + J == 130 and\n        C + I == 177 and\n        C + G == 75 and\n        G == 3 * F and\n        B - E == 150 and\n        J - C == -18 and\n        E + G == 123 and\n        D + F == 96 and\n        E + K == 78 and\n        H + K == 124\n    )\n\n# Find the correct permutation\nfor perm in permutations(numbers):\n    if check_constraints(perm):\n        print(list(perm))\n        break\n```\n\nThis code will find the correct assignment of numbers to letters that satisfy all the constraints. Let's execute it to find the solution.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the correct assignment of numbers to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K. Based on the output, we can map the numbers to the letters in alphabetical order:\n\n- A = 36\n- B = 225\n- C = 27\n- D = 80\n- E = 75\n- F = 16\n- G = 48\n- H = 121\n- I = 150\n- J = 9\n- K = 3\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[36, 225, 27, 80, 75, 16, 48, 121, 150, 9, 3]>>>"
