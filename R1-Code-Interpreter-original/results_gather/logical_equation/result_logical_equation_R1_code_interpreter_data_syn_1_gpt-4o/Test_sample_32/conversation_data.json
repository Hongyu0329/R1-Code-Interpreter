    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the given numbers to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K such that all the given inequalities are satisfied. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **List of numbers**: 3, 9, 16, 27, 36, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225\n2. **Equations**:\n   - D - A = 11\n   - H + I = 228\n   - G = 4.0B\n   - I - F = -118\n   - H - B = 216\n   - A + G = 52\n   - F + G = 157\n   - E = 3.0A\n   - G + I = 39\n   - C - H = -75\n\nLet's start by solving these equations step by step:\n\n- From equation 3, G = 4.0B, G must be a multiple of 4. The possible values for B are 3, 9, 16, 27, 36, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225. The possible values for G are 12, 36, 64, 108, 144, 192, 300, 320, 484, 600, 900. The only possible value for G from the given list is 48, which means B = 12, but 12 is not in the list. Let's try another approach.\n\n- From equation 6, A + G = 52. The possible pairs (A, G) are (3, 49), (9, 43), (16, 36), (27, 25), (36, 16), (48, 4). The only valid pair from the list is (16, 36).\n\n- From equation 1, D - A = 11, and A = 16, so D = 27.\n\n- From equation 8, E = 3.0A, and A = 16, so E = 48.\n\n- From equation 7, F + G = 157, and G = 36, so F = 121.\n\n- From equation 4, I - F = -118, and F = 121, so I = 3.\n\n- From equation 2, H + I = 228, and I = 3, so H = 225.\n\n- From equation 5, H - B = 216, and H = 225, so B = 9.\n\n- From equation 10, C - H = -75, and H = 225, so C = 150.\n\nNow, we have the values for A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I. The remaining numbers are 75 and 80, which can be assigned to J and K. Let's assign J = 75 and K = 80.\n\nLet's verify these assignments with the given equations and constraints using a Python script:\n\n```python\n# Assigning values to letters\nA = 16\nB = 9\nC = 150\nD = 27\nE = 48\nF = 121\nG = 36\nH = 225\nI = 3\nJ = 75\nK = 80\n\n# Verifying the equations\nequations = [\n    D - A == 11,\n    H + I == 228,\n    G == 4.0 * B,\n    I - F == -118,\n    H - B == 216,\n    A + G == 52,\n    F + G == 157,\n    E == 3.0 * A,\n    G + I == 39,\n    C - H == -75\n]\n\n# Check if all equations are satisfied\nall_satisfied = all(equations)\n\nprint(all_satisfied)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify if all equations are satisfied.",
    "The code output indicates that all the equations are satisfied with the assigned values. Therefore, the values for each letter are as follows:\n\n- A = 16\n- B = 9\n- C = 150\n- D = 27\n- E = 48\n- F = 121\n- G = 36\n- H = 225\n- I = 3\n- J = 75\n- K = 80\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[16, 9, 150, 27, 48, 121, 36, 225, 3, 75, 80]>>>"
