    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the given numbers to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K such that all the given inequalities are satisfied. The numbers available are 3, 9, 16, 20, 39, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, and 225.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the inequalities:\n\n1. \\( C - K = -17 \\) implies \\( C = K + 17 \\).\n2. \\( J = 2.0D \\) implies \\( J \\) is twice \\( D \\).\n3. \\( G - K = 205 \\) implies \\( G = K + 205 \\).\n4. \\( E + H = 119 \\).\n5. \\( C - J = -147 \\) implies \\( C = J - 147 \\).\n6. \\( F + K = 36 \\) implies \\( F = 36 - K \\).\n7. \\( F + G = 241 \\) implies \\( G = 241 - F \\).\n8. \\( H - F = 64 \\) implies \\( H = F + 64 \\).\n9. \\( I - B = -39 \\) implies \\( I = B - 39 \\).\n10. \\( D + K = 95 \\) implies \\( D = 95 - K \\).\n11. \\( B + J = 198 \\) implies \\( B = 198 - J \\).\n\nWe can use these equations to find the values of the letters. Let's write a Python script to solve this system of equations by trying all possible combinations of the given numbers.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# The numbers to be assigned\nnumbers = [3, 9, 16, 20, 39, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225]\n\n# Iterate over all permutations of the numbers\nfor perm in permutations(numbers):\n    A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K = perm\n    \n    # Check all conditions\n    if (C - K == -17 and\n        J == 2 * D and\n        G - K == 205 and\n        E + H == 119 and\n        C - J == -147 and\n        F + K == 36 and\n        F + G == 241 and\n        H - F == 64 and\n        I - B == -39 and\n        D + K == 95 and\n        B + J == 198):\n        \n        # If all conditions are satisfied, print the result\n        print([A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K])\n        break\n```\n\nThis code will iterate over all permutations of the numbers and check if they satisfy all the given inequalities. Once a valid assignment is found, it will print the values in alphabetical order.",
