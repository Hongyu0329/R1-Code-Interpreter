    "The error is due to the use of `is_integer()` on integer values, which is unnecessary. Let's correct the code by removing the `is_integer()` check and ensure that the calculations result in integers by using integer division where necessary.\n\nHere's the corrected approach:\n\n```python\n# Given numbers\nnumbers = [2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, 96]\n\n# Iterate over possible values for F\nfor F in numbers:\n    # Calculate dependent variables\n    B = 1.5 * F\n    G = 3.6 * F\n    J = F + 86\n    M = F + 6\n    L = 1.5 * M\n    \n    # Check if B, G, J, M, L are integers and in the list of numbers\n    if all(x in numbers for x in [B, G, J, M, L]):\n        # Convert to integers\n        B, G, J, M, L = int(B), int(G), int(J), int(M), int(L)\n        \n        # Remove used numbers\n        remaining_numbers = set(numbers) - {F, B, G, J, M, L}\n        \n        # Iterate over possible values for A\n        for A in remaining_numbers:\n            C = 4.0 * A\n            if C in remaining_numbers:\n                # Convert to integer\n                C = int(C)\n                \n                # Remove used numbers\n                remaining_numbers_2 = remaining_numbers - {A, C}\n                \n                # Iterate over possible values for E\n                for E in remaining_numbers_2:\n                    D = 1.5 * E\n                    if D in remaining_numbers_2:\n                        # Convert to integer\n                        D = int(D)\n                        \n                        # Remove used numbers\n                        remaining_numbers_3 = remaining_numbers_2 - {E, D}\n                        \n                        # Iterate over possible values for H\n                        for H in remaining_numbers_3:\n                            I = L + 21\n                            if I in remaining_numbers_3:\n                                # Convert to integer\n                                I = int(I)\n                                \n                                # Remaining number is K\n                                K = (remaining_numbers_3 - {H, I}).pop()\n                                \n                                # Check all conditions\n                                if (H - L == 26 and\n                                    B + M == 31 and\n                                    L - I == -21):\n                                    # If all conditions are satisfied, print the result\n                                    print([A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M])\n                                    break\n```\n\nThis code should now correctly handle the integer checks and calculations.

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Calculate the number for each letter based on the range and set of inequalities that the given letter represents.
