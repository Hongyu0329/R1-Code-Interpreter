    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 1, 3, 4, 9, 16, 27, 36, 80, and 121 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I, respectively, while satisfying the given system of equations. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Equation Analysis:**\n   - A = 3.0E\n   - D + F = 81\n   - A + D = 28\n   - C + F = 96\n   - A + E = 36\n   - B + E = 12\n   - B - F = -77\n\n2. **Initial Observations:**\n   - From equation 7, B = F - 77.\n   - From equation 2, D = 81 - F.\n   - From equation 3, A = 28 - D = 28 - (81 - F) = F - 53.\n   - From equation 5, E = 36 - A = 36 - (F - 53) = 89 - F.\n   - From equation 6, B = 12 - E = 12 - (89 - F) = F - 77.\n\n3. **Substituting Values:**\n   - We have two expressions for B: B = F - 77 and B = F - 77, which are consistent.\n   - We need to find F such that all values are within the given set of numbers.\n\n4. **Iterate Over Possible Values:**\n   - We will iterate over the possible values for F and check if the resulting values for A, B, C, D, E, and F are within the given set of numbers.\n\nLet's write a Python script to find the correct assignment of numbers to letters.\n\n```python\n# Possible values for the letters\npossible_values = [1, 3, 4, 9, 16, 27, 36, 80, 121]\n\n# Iterate over possible values for F\nfor F in possible_values:\n    B = F - 77\n    D = 81 - F\n    A = F - 53\n    E = 89 - F\n    C = 96 - F\n    \n    # Check if all values are in the possible values list\n    if all(x in possible_values for x in [A, B, C, D, E, F]):\n        # Check if A = 3.0E\n        if A == 3 * E:\n            # Check if B + E = 12\n            if B + E == 12:\n                # Check if A + D = 28\n                if A + D == 28:\n                    # Check if C + F = 96\n                    if C + F == 96:\n                        # Check if A + E = 36\n                        if A + E == 36:\n                            # Check if B - F = -77\n                            if B - F == -77:\n                                # If all conditions are satisfied, print the result\n                                print([A, B, C, D, E, F])\n                                break\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the solution.",
    "The code execution has provided us with the values for the letters A, B, C, D, E, and F. Let's analyze the results:\n\n- A = 27\n- B = 3\n- C = 16\n- D = 1\n- E = 9\n- F = 80\n\nThese values satisfy all the given equations:\n\n1. A = 3.0E: 27 = 3 * 9\n2. D + F = 81: 1 + 80 = 81\n3. A + D = 28: 27 + 1 = 28\n4. C + F = 96: 16 + 80 = 96\n5. A + E = 36: 27 + 9 = 36\n6. B + E = 12: 3 + 9 = 12\n7. B - F = -77: 3 - 80 = -77\n\nThe values are consistent with the constraints provided.
