    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the correct numbers to each letter based on the given inequalities. We have a set of numbers and a set of equations that relate these numbers to each other. Let's break down the problem and solve it step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the numbers and letters:**\n   - Numbers: 3, 9, 16, 20, 39, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225\n   - Letters: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K\n\n2. **Analyze the equations:**\n   - B + E = 170\n   - H - C = -46\n   - K = 3.0G\n   - B + I = 230\n   - C - H = 46\n   - D = 3.0H\n   - C - D = -104\n   - H - J = 36\n   - A = 2.4E\n   - I - E = 60\n   - C - K = 112\n\n3. **Solve the equations:**\n   - From equations 2 and 5, we have H = C - 46 and C = H + 46.
