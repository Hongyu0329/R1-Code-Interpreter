    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the given numbers to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M such that all the inequalities and equations are satisfied. The numbers available are 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50, 96.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n\n1. A = 2.8K\n2. A + F = 30\n3. C + D = 31\n4. G - L = 45\n5. L - C = -19\n6. I = 1.5K\n7. A > D\n8. J + K = 13\n9. B = 3.6K\n10. C = 1.6I\n11. B + G = 86\n12. K - J = 7\n\nWe can start by solving the equations that involve fewer variables and then use those solutions to solve the more complex equations.\n\n1. From equation 8 and 12, we have:\n   - J + K = 13\n   - K - J = 7\n\n   Solving these two equations simultaneously gives us:\n   - K = 10\n   - J = 3\n\n2. Using K = 10 in equation 1:\n   - A = 2.8 * 10 = 28\n\n3. Using K = 10 in equation 6:\n   - I = 1.5 * 10 = 15\n\n4. Using K = 10 in equation 9:\n   - B = 3.6 * 10 = 36\n\n5. Using I = 15 in equation 10:\n   - C = 1.6 * 15 = 24\n\n6. Using C = 24 in equation 5:\n   - L = C - 19 = 24 - 19 = 5\n\n7. Using L = 5 in equation 4:\n   - G = L + 45 = 5 + 45 = 50\n\n8. Using B = 36 and G = 50 in equation 11:\n   - B + G = 86, which is satisfied.\n\n9. Using A = 28 in equation 2:\n   - F = 30 - A = 30 - 28 = 2\n\n10. Using C = 24 in equation 3:\n    - D = 31 - C = 31 - 24 = 7\n\n11. Check if A > D:\n    - 28 > 7, which is satisfied.\n\nNow, we have assigned values to all letters except E, H, and M. The remaining numbers are 3, 16, and 96. Since there are no constraints involving E, H, and M, we can assign these numbers arbitrarily to these letters.\n\nLet's assign:\n- E = 3\n- H = 16\n- M = 96\n\nNow, let's compile the final list of values for each letter in alphabetical order:\n\n```python\n# Assigning the values to the letters\nA = 28\nB = 36\nC = 24\nD = 7\nE = 3\nF = 2\nG = 50\nH = 16\nI = 15\nJ = 3\nK = 10\nL = 5\nM = 96\n\n# Creating the list in alphabetical order\nresult = [A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M]\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to get the final answer.",
    "The code execution has provided the list of values for each letter in alphabetical order. Let's verify the solution against the constraints:\n\n1. A = 2.8K: A = 28, K = 10, so 2.8 * 10 = 28, which is correct.\n2. A + F = 30: A = 28, F = 2, so 28 + 2 = 30, which is correct.\n3. C + D = 31: C = 24, D = 7, so 24 + 7 = 31, which is correct.\n4. G - L = 45: G = 50, L = 5, so 50 - 5 = 45, which is correct.\n5. L - C = -19: L = 5, C = 24, so 5 - 24 = -19, which is correct.\n6. I = 1.5K: I = 15, K = 10, so 1.5 * 10 = 15, which is correct.\n7. A > D: A = 28, D = 7, so 28 > 7, which is correct.\n8. J + K = 13: J = 3, K = 10, so 3 + 10 = 13, which is correct.\n9. B = 3.6K: B = 36, K = 10, so 3.6 * 10 = 36, which is correct.\n10. C = 1.6I: C = 24, I = 15, so 1.6 * 15 = 24, which is correct.\n11. B + G = 86: B = 36, G = 50, so 36 + 50 = 86, which is correct.\n12. K - J = 7: K = 10, J = 3, so 10 - 3 = 7, which is correct.\n\nAll constraints are satisfied, and the values are correctly assigned. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[28, 36, 24, 7, 3, 2, 50, 16, 15, 3, 10, 5, 96]>>>"
