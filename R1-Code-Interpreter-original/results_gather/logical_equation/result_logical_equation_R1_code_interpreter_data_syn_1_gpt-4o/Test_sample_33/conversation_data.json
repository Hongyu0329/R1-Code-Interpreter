    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the given numbers to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K such that all the given inequalities are satisfied. Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **List of numbers**: 3, 9, 16, 27, 36, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225\n2. **Equations**:\n   - E - F = -59\n   - G - C = 6\n   - H + J = 107\n   - E + I = 137\n   - B = 4.0G\n   - A + G = 234\n   - G = 3.0C\n   - E - H = -64\n   - C - E = -13\n   - F + K = 123\n\nLet's start by solving the equations that involve direct relationships:\n\n- From G = 3.0C, we can determine that G must be three times the value of C.\n- From B = 4.0G, B must be four times the value of G.\n- From C - E = -13, we can express E in terms of C: E = C + 13.\n- From E - F = -59, we can express F in terms of E: F = E + 59.\n- From E - H = -64, we can express H in terms of E: H = E + 64.\n- From E + I = 137, we can express I in terms of E: I = 137 - E.\n- From H + J = 107, we can express J in terms of H: J = 107 - H.\n- From A + G = 234, we can express A in terms of G: A = 234 - G.\n- From F + K = 123, we can express K in terms of F: K = 123 - F.\n\nNow, let's use these relationships to find the values of the letters. We will use a systematic approach to assign values to the letters and check if they satisfy all the equations.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# List of possible values\nvalues = [3, 9, 16, 27, 36, 48, 75, 80, 121, 150, 225]\n\n# Iterate over all permutations of the values\nfor perm in permutations(values):\n    A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K = perm\n    \n    # Check all the conditions\n    if (E - F == -59 and\n        G - C == 6 and\n        H + J == 107 and\n        E + I == 137 and\n        B == 4.0 * G and\n        A + G == 234 and\n        G == 3.0 * C and\n        E - H == -64 and\n        C - E == -13 and\n        F + K == 123):\n        \n        # If all conditions are satisfied, print the result\n        print([A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K])\n        break\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the correct assignment of values to the letters.",
