The output `[80, 39, 75, 16, 121, 9, 3, 150, 225, 48, 20]` corresponds to the values of the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K, respectively.\n\nTherefore, the values for each letter in alphabetical order are:\n\n- A = 80\n- B = 39\n- C = 75\n- D = 16\n- E = 121\n- F = 9\n- G = 3\n- H = 150\n- I = 225\n- J = 48\n- K = 20\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<[80, 39, 75, 16, 121, 9, 3, 150, 225, 48, 20]>>>"
