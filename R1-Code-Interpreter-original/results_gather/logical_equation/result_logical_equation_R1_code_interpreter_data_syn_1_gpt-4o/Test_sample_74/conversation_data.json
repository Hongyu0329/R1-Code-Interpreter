    "To solve this problem, we need to assign the numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, and 50 to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and M, respectively, while satisfying the given system of inequalities.\n\nLet's break down the constraints and solve them step by step:\n\n1. **E + F = 8**: The possible pairs (E, F) are (1, 7) and (7, 1).\n\n2. **C - D = 14**: The possible pairs (C, D) are (15, 1), (16, 2), (24, 10), (28, 14), (36, 22), (45, 31), and (50, 36). However, only (15, 1) and (16, 2) are valid since 1 and 2 are in the list.\n\n3. **A + M = 35**: The possible pairs (A, M) are (15, 20), (16, 19), (24, 11), (28, 7), and (36, -1). Only (28, 7) is valid since both numbers are in the list.\n\n4. **D + K = 3**: Since D = 1 from the previous step, K must be 2.\n\n5. **G + J = 60**: The possible pairs (G, J) are (24, 36) and (36, 24).\n\n6. **B > F**: Since F is either 1 or 7, B must be greater than F.\n\n7. **H + I = 60**: The possible pairs (H, I) are (24, 36) and (36, 24).\n\n8. **A - K = 5**: Since A = 28 and K = 2, this constraint is satisfied.\n\n9. **G - H = 26**: The possible pairs (G, H) are (36, 10) and (50, 24).\n\n10. **G - F = 45**: Since F = 1, G must be 46, which is not in the list. Therefore, F must be 5, and G must be 50.\n\nNow, let's use these constraints to find the values for each letter. We'll write a Python script to solve this:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Possible values for the letters\nvalues = [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50]\n\n# Constraints\ndef check_constraints(assignment):\n    A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M = assignment\n    return (\n        E + F == 8 and\n        C - D == 14 and\n        A + M == 35 and\n        D + K == 3 and\n        G + J == 60 and\n        B > F and\n        H + I == 60 and\n        A - K == 5 and\n        G - H == 26 and\n        G - F == 45\n    )\n\n# Find the correct permutation\nfor perm in permutations(values):\n    if check_constraints(perm):\n        print(list(perm))\n        break\n```\n\nThis code will find the correct assignment of numbers to letters that satisfies all the given constraints. Let's execute it to find the solution.",
    "The timeout error suggests that the code is taking too long to execute, likely due to the large number of permutations being checked. To optimize the solution, we can reduce the search space by applying some constraints directly before generating permutations. Let's refine the approach:\n\n1. **E + F = 8**: E and F can only be (1, 7) or (7, 1).\n2. **D + K = 3**: D and K can only be (1, 2) or (2, 1).\n3. **A + M = 35**: A and M can only be (28, 7) or (7, 28).\n4. **G - F = 45**: G must be 50 and F must be 5.\n\nWith these constraints, we can significantly reduce the number of permutations needed. Let's implement this:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\n# Possible values for the letters\nvalues = [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 16, 24, 28, 36, 45, 50]\n\n# Constraints\ndef check_constraints(assignment):\n    A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M = assignment\n    return (\n        E + F == 8 and\n        C - D == 14 and\n        A + M == 35 and\n        D + K == 3 and\n        G + J == 60 and\n        B > F and\n        H + I == 60 and\n        A - K == 5 and\n        G - H == 26 and\n        G - F == 45\n    )\n\n# Pre-assign known values based on constraints\nF = 5\nG = 50\n\n# Remaining values to permute\nremaining_values = [v for v in values if v not in (F, G)]\n\n# Find the correct permutation\nfor perm in permutations(remaining_values):\n    A, B, C, D, E, H, I, J, K, L, M = perm\n    if check_constraints((A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M)):\n        print([A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M])\n        break\n```\n\nThis code should execute more efficiently by reducing the number of permutations. Let's run it to find the solution.",
