    "To solve this problem, we need to select 12 different numbers from the 6x6 grid such that the product of the selected numbers in each row and column is greater than 0. We start with the number 2 at position (0,5) as our first selected number. Let's analyze the grid and select numbers step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Selection**: Start with the number 2 at position (0,5).\n\n2. **Row and Column Analysis**:\n   - We need to ensure that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive. This means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column or all positive numbers.\n\n3. **Selection Strategy**:\n   - We will select numbers such that each row and column has a positive product.\n   - We will try to balance the selection of positive and negative numbers.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Selection**:\n   - **Row 0**: We have already selected (0,5). We need to select one more number from this row. Choose (0,3) which is 12 (positive).\n   - **Row 1**: Select (1,0) which is 8 (positive) and (1,4) which is 12 (positive).\n   - **Row 2**: Select (2,0) which is 6 (positive) and (2,3) which is 9 (positive).\n   - **Row 3**: Select (3,0) which is 4 (positive) and (3,5) which is 11 (positive).\n   - **Row 4**: Select (4,2) which is 8 (positive) and (4,5) which is 11 (positive).\n   - **Row 5**: Select (5,0) which is 6 (positive) and (5,3) which is 11 (positive).\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - Check each row and column to ensure the product of selected numbers is positive.\n   - Each row has two selected numbers, and each column has two selected numbers.\n\n6. **Final Selection**:\n   - The selected positions are: (0,3), (0,5), (1,0), (1,4), (2,0), (2,3), (3,0), (3,5), (4,2), (4,5), (5,0), (5,3).\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 3, 0 5, 1 0, 1 4, 2 0, 2 3, 3 0, 3 5, 4 2, 4 5, 5 0, 5 3>>>"
