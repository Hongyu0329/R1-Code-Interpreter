    "To solve this problem, we need to select three different numbers from a 2x2 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 1 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) is already selected. Let's analyze the grid and the constraints step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Representation:**\n   - The grid is given as:\n     ```\n     3, 1\n     2, 3\n     ```\n   - In terms of coordinates, this grid can be represented as:\n     ```\n     (0,0): 3, (0,1): 1\n     (1,0): 2, (1,1): 3\n     ```\n\n2. **Selected Number:**\n   - We are required to select the number 1 at position (0,1) as the first selected number.\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - We need to select two more numbers such that:\n     - The sum of the selected numbers in each row is ≤ 4.\n     - The sum of the selected numbers in each column is ≤ 4.\n\n4. **Analysis:**\n   - Since (0,1) is already selected, the number 1 is part of the sum for row 0 and column 1.\n   - We need to select two more numbers from the remaining three positions: (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1).\n\n5. **Possible Selections:**\n   - Let's consider the possible selections:\n     - If we select (0,0) and (1,0):\n       - Row 0 sum: 3 (from (0,0)) + 1 (from (0,1)) = 4\n       - Row 1 sum: 2 (from (1,0))\n       - Column 0 sum: 3 (from (0,0)) + 2 (from (1,0)) = 5 (exceeds 4)\n       - Column 1 sum: 1 (from (0,1))\n       - This selection does not satisfy the column constraint.\n     - If we select (0,0) and (1,1):\n       - Row 0 sum: 3 (from (0,0)) + 1 (from (0,1)) = 4\n       - Row 1 sum: 3 (from (1,1))\n       - Column 0 sum: 3 (from (0,0))\n       - Column 1 sum: 1 (from (0,1)) + 3 (from (1,1)) = 4\n       - This selection satisfies all constraints.\n     - If we select (1,0) and (1,1):\n       - Row 0 sum: 1 (from (0,1))\n       - Row 1 sum: 2 (from (1,0)) + 3 (from (1,1)) = 5 (exceeds 4)\n       - Column 0 sum: 2 (from (1,0))\n       - Column 1 sum: 1 (from (0,1)) + 3 (from (1,1)) = 4\n       - This selection does not satisfy the row constraint.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only selection that satisfies all constraints is selecting the numbers at positions (0,0), (0,1), and (1,1).\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<0 0, 0 1, 1 1>>>"
