    "To solve this problem, we need to select 16 different numbers from the 7x7 grid such that the product of the numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We start by selecting the number 8 at position (0,6) as given.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Selection**: Start with the number 8 at position (0,6).\n\n2. **Understanding the Grid**: The grid is a 7x7 matrix with numbers ranging from -14 to 14. We need to ensure that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive.\n\n3. **Product Condition**: For the product to be positive, we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers.\n\n4. **Selection Strategy**:\n   - We need to select 16 numbers, which means some rows and columns will have more than one selected number.\n   - We should aim to balance the number of negative and positive numbers in each row and column.\n\n5. **Start with the Given Number**: We have the number 8 at position (0,6). This is a positive number.\n\n6. **Select Numbers in the First Row**: \n   - We need to select at least one more number in the first row to ensure the product is positive.\n   - Choose numbers that will help balance the negatives and positives in the row and column.\n\n7. **Continue Selection**:\n   - Move to the next rows and columns, ensuring that the product condition is met.\n   - Keep track of the number of negative numbers selected in each row and column.\n\n8. **Ensure 16 Numbers are Selected**: \n   - Carefully select numbers to ensure exactly 16 numbers are chosen.\n   - Check that the product condition is satisfied for each row and column.\n\n9. **Final Check**: Verify that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive.\n\n### Final Selection:\n\nAfter analyzing the grid and applying the above strategy, the selected positions are:\n\n<<<0 6, 0 0, 0 3, 1 1, 1 6, 2 0, 2 3, 2 6, 3 0, 3 3, 3 6, 4 0, 4 3, 5 0, 5 3, 6 0>>>"
