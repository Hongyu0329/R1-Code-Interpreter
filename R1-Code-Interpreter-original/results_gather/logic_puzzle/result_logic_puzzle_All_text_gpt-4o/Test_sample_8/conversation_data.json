    "To solve this problem, we need to select three different numbers from a 2x2 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 3 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) is already selected. Let's analyze the grid and the constraints step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Representation:**\n   - The grid is represented as:\n     ```\n     (0,0) (0,1)\n     (1,0) (1,1)\n     ```\n   - The numbers in the grid are:\n     ```\n     2, 3\n     3, 1\n     ```\n\n2. **Selected Number:**\n   - We are given that the number 3 at position (0,1) is already selected.\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - We need to select two more numbers such that:\n     - The sum of the selected numbers in each row is ≤ 4.\n     - The sum of the selected numbers in each column is ≤ 4.\n\n4. **Possible Selections:**\n   - We need to select two more numbers from the remaining three positions: (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1).\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n   - **Select (0,1):** Number is 3 (already selected).\n   - **Select (0,0):** Number is 2.\n     - Row 0 sum = 2 + 3 = 5 (exceeds 4, not possible).\n   - **Select (1,0):** Number is 3.\n     - Column 0 sum = 3 + 3 = 6 (exceeds 4, not possible).\n   - **Select (1,1):** Number is 1.\n     - Row 1 sum = 3 + 1 = 4 (valid).\n     - Column 1 sum = 3 + 1 = 4 (valid).\n\n6. **Final Selection:**\n   - The valid selection is to choose numbers at positions (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1).\n\nTherefore, the selected positions are <<<0 1, 1 0, 1 1>>>."
