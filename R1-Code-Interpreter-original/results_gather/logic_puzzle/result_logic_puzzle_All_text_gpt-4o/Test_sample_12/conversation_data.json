    "To solve this problem, we need to select three different numbers from a 2x2 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 3 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) is already selected. Let's analyze the grid and the constraints step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Representation:**\n   - The grid is represented as follows:\n     ```\n     (0,0) (0,1)\n     (1,0) (1,1)\n     ```\n   - The numbers in the grid are:\n     ```\n     1, 3\n     1, 2\n     ```\n\n2. **Selected Number:**\n   - We are given that the number 3 at position (0,1) is already selected.\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - We need to select two more numbers such that:\n     - The sum of the selected numbers in each row is ≤ 4.\n     - The sum of the selected numbers in each column is ≤ 4.\n\n4. **Possible Selections:**\n   - We need to select two more numbers from the remaining three positions: (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1).\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n   - **Select (0,0):** The number at (0,0) is 1.\n     - Row 0 sum: 1 (at 0,0) + 3 (at 0,1) = 4 (valid)\n     - Column 0 sum: 1 (at 0,0) + 1 (at 1,0) = 2 (valid)\n   - **Select (1,0):** The number at (1,0) is 1.\n     - Row 1 sum: 1 (at 1,0) + 2 (at 1,1) = 3 (valid)\n     - Column 0 sum: 1 (at 0,0) + 1 (at 1,0) = 2 (valid)\n   - **Select (1,1):** The number at (1,1) is 2.\n     - Row 1 sum: 1 (at 1,0) + 2 (at 1,1) = 3 (valid)\n     - Column 1 sum: 3 (at 0,1) + 2 (at 1,1) = 5 (invalid)\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The valid selections are (0,0) and (1,0) along with the already selected (0,1).\n   - The sum constraints are satisfied for both rows and columns.\n\nTherefore, the positions of the selected numbers are: <<<0 1, 0 0, 1 0>>>."
