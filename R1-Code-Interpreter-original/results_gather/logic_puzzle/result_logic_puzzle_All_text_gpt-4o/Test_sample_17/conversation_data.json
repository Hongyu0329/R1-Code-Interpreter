    "To solve this problem, we need to select four different numbers from the given 3x3 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 3 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) is the first selected number. Let's analyze the grid and constraints step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis:**\n   ```\n   (0,0) 1, (0,1) 2, (0,2) 3\n   (1,0) 2, (1,1) 3, (1,2) 3\n   (2,0) 1, (2,1) 4, (2,2) 2\n   ```\n\n2. **Initial Selection:**\n   - We start by selecting the number 3 at position (0,2).\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - We need to select three more numbers such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4.\n   - We must select four different numbers.\n\n4. **Selection Strategy:**\n   - Since we have already selected 3 at (0,2), the remaining numbers to select must be 1, 2, and 4.\n   - We need to ensure that the sum in each row and column does not exceed 4.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Selection:**\n   - **Row 0:** We have already selected 3 at (0,2). We cannot select any more numbers from this row because any additional number would exceed the sum of 4.\n   - **Row 1:** We can select 2 at (1,0). This keeps the sum in row 1 as 2, which is within the limit.\n   - **Row 2:** We can select 1 at (2,0). This keeps the sum in row 2 as 1, which is within the limit.\n\n6. **Column Constraints:**\n   - **Column 0:** We have selected 2 at (1,0) and 1 at (2,0). The sum is 3, which is within the limit.\n   - **Column 1:** We have not selected any numbers from this column, so the sum is 0.\n   - **Column 2:** We have selected 3 at (0,2). We cannot select any more numbers from this column because any additional number would exceed the sum of 4.\n\n7. **Final Selection:**\n   - The selected numbers are at positions (0,2), (1,0), and (2,0).\n\n8. **Verification:**\n   - We have selected the numbers 3, 2, and 1, which are different.\n   - The sum in each row and column is within the limit of 4.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 2, 1 0, 2 0>>>"
