    "To solve this problem, we need to select four different numbers from the given 3x3 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 1 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) is the first selected number. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Representation:**\n   - The grid is:\n     ```\n     4, 4, 1\n     3, 2, 1\n     2, 2, 4\n     ```\n   - The coordinates for each cell are:\n     ```\n     (0,0), (0,1), (0,2)\n     (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)\n     (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n     ```\n\n2. **Initial Selection:**\n   - We start by selecting the number 1 at position (0,2).\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - We need to select three more numbers such that:\n     - The sum of selected numbers in each row is ≤ 4.\n     - The sum of selected numbers in each column is ≤ 4.\n   - We must select four different numbers.\n\n4. **Selection Strategy:**\n   - Since we have already selected 1 at (0,2), the sum for row 0 is currently 1, and the sum for column 2 is currently 1.\n   - We need to select numbers such that the sum in each row and column does not exceed 4.\n\n5. **Possible Selections:**\n   - Let's consider selecting numbers from different rows and columns to satisfy the constraints:\n     - From row 1, we can select the number 3 at (1,0).\n     - From row 2, we can select the number 2 at (2,0).\n     - We need one more number, and it should be different from the ones already selected (1, 3, 2).\n\n6. **Checking Constraints:**\n   - If we select 3 at (1,0), the sum for row 1 becomes 3, and the sum for column 0 becomes 5 (which is not allowed).\n   - If we select 2 at (2,0), the sum for row 2 becomes 2, and the sum for column 0 becomes 2.\n   - We need to adjust our selection to ensure all constraints are met.\n\n7. **Final Selection:**\n   - Select 1 at (0,2).\n   - Select 2 at (1,1).\n   - Select 1 at (1,2).\n   - Select 2 at (2,0).\n\n8. **Verification:**\n   - Row 0: 1 (sum = 1)\n   - Row 1: 2 + 1 = 3 (sum = 3)\n   - Row 2: 2 (sum = 2)\n   - Column 0: 2 (sum = 2)\n   - Column 1: 2 (sum = 2)\n   - Column 2: 1 + 1 = 2 (sum = 2)\n\nAll constraints are satisfied, and we have selected four different numbers.\n\nThe selected positions are:\n<<<0 2, 1 1, 1 2, 2 0>>>"
