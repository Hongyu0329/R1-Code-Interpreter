    "To solve this problem, we need to select 9 different numbers from the 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 8 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Grid and Constraints:**\n   - We have a 5x5 grid with numbers ranging from -7 to 8.\n   - We need to select 9 numbers such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0.\n   - The number at position (0,4) is already selected.\n\n2. **Product Greater than 0:**\n   - For the product of numbers in a row or column to be greater than 0, the number of negative numbers must be even, or all numbers must be positive.\n\n3. **Initial Selection:**\n   - Start with the given number at (0,4), which is 8.\n\n4. **Strategy for Selection:**\n   - We need to ensure that each row and column with selected numbers has a positive product.\n   - We should aim to select numbers such that the number of negative numbers in any row or column is even.\n\n5. **Select Numbers:**\n   - Start by selecting numbers in the same row and column as the initial number (0,4) to ensure a positive product.\n   - Choose numbers from other rows and columns while maintaining the condition for a positive product.\n\n6. **Step-by-Step Selection:**\n   - Select (0,4) as given.\n   - Select (0,3) to ensure a positive product in row 0.\n   - Select (1,3) to ensure a positive product in column 3.\n   - Select (1,4) to ensure a positive product in row 1.\n   - Select (2,4) to ensure a positive product in column 4.\n   - Select (3,4) to ensure a positive product in column 4.\n   - Select (4,4) to ensure a positive product in column 4.\n   - Select (4,3) to ensure a positive product in row 4.\n   - Select (4,2) to ensure a positive product in row 4.\n\n7. **Verify Selection:**\n   - Check each row and column with selected numbers to ensure the product is positive.\n\nBy following this strategy, we can select the numbers as follows:\n\n<<<0 3, 0 4, 1 3, 1 4, 2 4, 3 4, 4 2, 4 3, 4 4>>>"
