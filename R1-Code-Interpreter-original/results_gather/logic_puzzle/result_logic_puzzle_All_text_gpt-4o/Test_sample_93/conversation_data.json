    "To solve this problem, we need to select 12 different numbers from the 6x6 grid such that the product of the selected numbers in each row and column is greater than 0. We start by selecting the number 1 at position (0,5) as given. The goal is to ensure that the product of the selected numbers in each row and column is positive, which means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n\nLet's analyze the grid and select numbers step by step:\n\n1. **Start with the given number:**\n   - (0,5) = 1\n\n2. **Select numbers from the first row:**\n   - We already have (0,5) = 1.\n   - Select (0,0) = 5 and (0,3) = 11. This gives us three positive numbers in the first row.\n\n3. **Select numbers from the second row:**\n   - Select (1,0) = 7 and (1,1) = 9. Both are positive.\n   - Select (1,3) = 12. This gives us three positive numbers in the second row.\n\n4. **Select numbers from the third row:**\n   - Select (2,0) = 3 and (2,1) = 10. Both are positive.\n   - Select (2,5) = 1. This gives us three positive numbers in the third row.\n\n5. **Select numbers from the fourth row:**\n   - Select (3,4) = 3 and (3,5) = 6. Both are positive.\n   - Select (3,0) = 3. This gives us three positive numbers in the fourth row.\n\n6. **Select numbers from the fifth row:**\n   - Select (4,4) = 2 and (4,5) = 3. Both are positive.\n   - Select (4,0) = 3. This gives us three positive numbers in the fifth row.\n\n7. **Select numbers from the sixth row:**\n   - Select (5,2) = 8 and (5,3) = 4. Both are positive.\n   - Select (5,5) = 6. This gives us three positive numbers in the sixth row.\n\nNow, let's verify the column products:\n\n- **Column 0:** (0,0) = 5, (1,0) = 7, (2,0) = 3, (3,0) = 3, (4,0) = 3. Product = 5 * 7 * 3 * 3 * 3 > 0.\n- **Column 1:** (1,1) = 9, (2,1) = 10. Product = 9 * 10 > 0.\n- **Column 2:** (5,2) = 8. Product = 8 > 0.\n- **Column 3:** (0,3) = 11, (1,3) = 12, (5,3) = 4. Product = 11 * 12 * 4 > 0.\n- **Column 4:** (3,4) = 3, (4,4) = 2. Product = 3 * 2 > 0.\n- **Column 5:** (0,5) = 1, (2,5) = 1, (3,5) = 6, (4,5) = 3, (5,5) = 6. Product = 1 * 1 * 6 * 3 * 6 > 0.\n\nAll row and column products are positive, and we have selected 12 numbers.\n\nThe selected positions are:\n<<<0 0, 0 3, 0 5, 1 0, 1 1, 1 3, 2 0, 2 1, 2 5, 3 0, 3 4, 3 5>>>"
