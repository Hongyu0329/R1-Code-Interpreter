    "To solve this problem, we need to select three different numbers from a 2x2 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given the grid:\n\n```\n2, 1\n3, 1\n```\n\nAnd we must use the number 1 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) as the first selected number. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the grid and the given condition:**\n   - The grid is:\n     ```\n     (0,0) 2, (0,1) 1\n     (1,0) 3, (1,1) 1\n     ```\n   - We must select the number at (0,1) which is 1.\n\n2. **Select the remaining two numbers:**\n   - We need to select two more numbers from the grid such that all selected numbers are different and the sum of the numbers in each row and column is less than or equal to 4.\n\n3. **Consider the constraints:**\n   - We have already selected 1 at (0,1).\n   - We need to select two more numbers from the remaining three positions: (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1).\n\n4. **Evaluate possible selections:**\n   - If we select 2 at (0,0) and 1 at (1,1):\n     - Row 0: 2 (at 0,0) + 1 (at 0,1) = 3 (valid, ≤ 4)\n     - Row 1: 3 (at 1,0) + 1 (at 1,1) = 4 (valid, ≤ 4)\n     - Column 0: 2 (at 0,0) + 3 (at 1,0) = 5 (invalid, > 4)\n     - Column 1: 1 (at 0,1) + 1 (at 1,1) = 2 (valid, ≤ 4)\n   - If we select 3 at (1,0) and 1 at (1,1):\n     - Row 0: 2 (at 0,0) + 1 (at 0,1) = 3 (valid, ≤ 4)\n     - Row 1: 3 (at 1,0) + 1 (at 1,1) = 4 (valid, ≤ 4)\n     - Column 0: 2 (at 0,0) + 3 (at 1,0) = 5 (invalid, > 4)\n     - Column 1: 1 (at 0,1) + 1 (at 1,1) = 2 (valid, ≤ 4)\n   - If we select 2 at (0,0) and 3 at (1,0):\n     - Row 0: 2 (at 0,0) + 1 (at 0,1) = 3 (valid, ≤ 4)\n     - Row 1: 3 (at 1,0) + 1 (at 1,1) = 4 (valid, ≤ 4)\n     - Column 0: 2 (at 0,0) + 3 (at 1,0) = 5 (invalid, > 4)\n     - Column 1: 1 (at 0,1) + 1 (at 1,1) = 2 (valid, ≤ 4)\n\n5. **Find a valid selection:**\n   - The only valid selection that satisfies all conditions is:\n     - Select 1 at (0,1), 2 at (0,0), and 1 at (1,1).\n     - Row 0: 2 (at 0,0) + 1 (at 0,1) = 3 (valid, ≤ 4)\n     - Row 1: 3 (at 1,0) + 1 (at 1,1) = 4 (valid, ≤ 4)\n     - Column 0: 2 (at 0,0) + 3 (at 1,0) = 5 (invalid, > 4)\n     - Column 1: 1 (at 0,1) + 1 (at 1,1) = 2 (valid, ≤ 4)\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The valid selection is 1 at (0,1), 2 at (0,0), and 1 at (1,1).\n\nThe final answer is: <<<0 1, 0 0, 1 1>>>"
