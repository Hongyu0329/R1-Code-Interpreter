    "To solve this problem, we need to select 10 different numbers from the 5x5 grid such that the product of the numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We start with the number 2 at position (0,4) as our first selected number. Let's analyze the grid and select the numbers step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Selection**: We start with the number 2 at position (0,4).\n\n2. **Row and Column Analysis**:\n   - For row 0, we have selected 2 at (0,4). We need to select other numbers such that their product is positive. Since 2 is positive, we need an even number of negative numbers or all positive numbers in this row.\n   - For column 4, we have selected 2 at (0,4). Similarly, we need an even number of negative numbers or all positive numbers in this column.\n\n3. **Selecting Numbers**:\n   - **Row 0**: We have 2 at (0,4). We can select 1 at (0,3) and 2 at (0,0) to ensure the product is positive (2 * 1 * 2 = 4).\n   - **Column 4**: We have 2 at (0,4). We can select 6 at (1,4) and 10 at (4,4) to ensure the product is positive (2 * 6 * 10 = 120).\n\n4. **Continue Selection**:\n   - **Row 1**: We have 6 at (1,4). We can select 2 at (1,1) and 7 at (1,2) to ensure the product is positive (2 * 7 * 6 = 84).\n   - **Row 2**: We can select 3 at (2,0) and 9 at (2,3) to ensure the product is positive (3 * 9 = 27).\n   - **Row 3**: We can select 4 at (3,1) and 7 at (3,3) to ensure the product is positive (4 * 7 = 28).\n   - **Row 4**: We have 10 at (4,4). We can select 8 at (4,0) and 5 at (4,3) to ensure the product is positive (8 * 5 * 10 = 400).\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - Ensure that each row and column with selected numbers has a positive product.\n   - Ensure that we have selected exactly 10 numbers.\n\nAfter selecting the numbers, we have the following positions:\n\n- (0,4), (0,3), (0,0)\n- (1,4), (1,1), (1,2)\n- (2,0), (2,3)\n- (3,1), (3,3)\n- (4,0), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nHowever, we need to ensure we have exactly 10 numbers. Let's adjust:\n\n- (0,4), (0,3)\n- (1,4), (1,1)\n- (2,0), (2,3)\n- (3,1), (3,3)\n- (4,0), (4,4)\n\nThis gives us exactly 10 numbers, and the product of each row and column is positive.\n\nFinal answer: <<<0 4, 0 3, 1 4, 1 1, 2 0, 2 3, 3 1, 3 3, 4 0, 4 4>>>"
