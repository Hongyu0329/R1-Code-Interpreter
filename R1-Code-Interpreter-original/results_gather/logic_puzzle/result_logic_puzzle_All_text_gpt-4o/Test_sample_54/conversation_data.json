    "To solve this problem, we need to select 9 different numbers from the 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number -8 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Grid and Constraints:**\n   - We have a 5x5 grid with numbers ranging from -8 to 8.\n   - We need to select 9 numbers such that the product of numbers in each row and column is greater than 0.\n   - The product being greater than 0 means it must be positive, which implies an even number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n\n2. **Initial Selection:**\n   - We start with the number -8 at position (0,4).\n\n3. **Strategy for Selection:**\n   - Since we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column, and we already have one negative number at (0,4), we need to select another negative number in row 0 and column 4 to make their products positive.\n   - We need to ensure that the total number of selected numbers is 9, and they are distributed such that each row and column has a positive product.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Selection:**\n   - **Row 0:** We have -8 at (0,4). We need another negative number in this row. Select -6 at (0,1).\n   - **Column 4:** We have -8 at (0,4). We need another negative number in this column. Select -4 at (1,4).\n   - **Row 1:** We have -4 at (1,4). We need another negative number in this row. Select -5 at (1,1).\n   - **Column 1:** We have -6 at (0,1) and -5 at (1,1). We need a positive number to make the product positive. Select 8 at (2,1).\n   - **Row 2:** We have 8 at (2,1). We need another positive number. Select 5 at (2,3).\n   - **Column 3:** We have 5 at (2,3). We need another positive number. Select 3 at (3,3).\n   - **Row 3:** We have 3 at (3,3). We need another positive number. Select 7 at (3,0).\n   - **Column 0:** We have 7 at (3,0). We need another positive number. Select 6 at (4,0).\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   - Check each row and column to ensure the product of selected numbers is positive.\n   - Row 0: -6, -8 (product is positive)\n   - Row 1: -5, -4 (product is positive)\n   - Row 2: 8, 5 (product is positive)\n   - Row 3: 7, 3 (product is positive)\n   - Row 4: 6 (product is positive)\n   - Column 0: 7, 6 (product is positive)\n   - Column 1: -6, -5, 8 (product is positive)\n   - Column 3: 5, 3 (product is positive)\n   - Column 4: -8, -4 (product is positive)\n\n6. **Final Selection:**\n   - The selected positions are: (0,1), (0,4), (1,1), (1,4), (2,1), (2,3), (3,0), (3,3), (4,0).\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 1, 0 4, 1 1, 1 4, 2 1, 2 3, 3 0, 3 3, 4 0>>>"
