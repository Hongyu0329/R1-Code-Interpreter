    "To solve this problem, we need to select 10 different numbers from the given 5x5 grid such that the product of the numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Grid and Constraints:**\n   - The grid is 5x5, and we need to select 10 numbers.\n   - The product of numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers must be greater than 0, which means the product must be positive.\n   - We start with the number 2 at position (0,4).\n\n2. **Initial Selection:**\n   - We have already selected the number at (0,4), which is 2.\n\n3. **Selecting Numbers:**\n   - We need to ensure that the product of numbers in each row and column is positive. This means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column or all positive numbers.\n   - We need to carefully select numbers to maintain this condition.\n\n4. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by selecting numbers in the first row and first column to ensure the product is positive.\n   - Then, select numbers in other rows and columns, ensuring the product condition is met.\n\n5. **Selection Process:**\n   - **Row 0:** We have (0,4) = 2. We need more numbers in this row.\n     - Select (0,0) = 4 and (0,1) = 7. Now, the product for row 0 is 4 * 7 * 2 = 56, which is positive.\n   - **Column 4:** We have (0,4) = 2. We need more numbers in this column.\n     - Select (1,4) = 2 and (2,4) = 4. Now, the product for column 4 is 2 * 2 * 4 = 16, which is positive.\n   - **Row 1:** We have (1,4) = 2. We need more numbers in this row.\n     - Select (1,2) = 3 and (1,3) = 10. Now, the product for row 1 is -3 * 3 * 10 * 2 = -180, which is negative. We need to adjust.\n     - Instead, select (1,0) = -6 and (1,2) = 3. Now, the product for row 1 is -6 * 3 * 2 = -36, which is negative. We need to adjust.\n     - Select (1,0) = -6, (1,1) = -3, and (1,3) = 10. Now, the product for row 1 is -6 * -3 * 10 * 2 = 360, which is positive.\n   - **Row 2:** We have (2,4) = 4. We need more numbers in this row.\n     - Select (2,0) = 9 and (2,2) = 10. Now, the product for row 2 is 9 * 10 * 4 = 360, which is positive.\n   - **Column 0:** We have (0,0) = 4, (1,0) = -6, and (2,0) = 9. The product is 4 * -6 * 9 = -216, which is negative. We need to adjust.\n     - Select (3,0) = -4. Now, the product for column 0 is 4 * -6 * 9 * -4 = 864, which is positive.\n   - **Column 2:** We have (1,2) = 3 and (2,2) = 10. We need more numbers in this column.\n     - Select (3,2) = 8. Now, the product for column 2 is 3 * 10 * 8 = 240, which is positive.\n\n6. **Final Selection:**\n   - We have selected 10 numbers: (0,0), (0,1), (0,4), (1,0), (1,1), (1,3), (2,0), (2,2), (2,4), (3,0).\n\n7. **Verify:**\n   - Check each row and column to ensure the product is positive.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 0, 0 1, 0 4, 1 0, 1 1, 1 3, 2 0, 2 2, 2 4, 3 0>>>"
