    "To solve this problem, we need to select three different numbers from a 2x2 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) is already selected. Let's analyze the grid and the constraints step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Layout and Initial Selection:**\n   - The grid is:\n     ```\n     1, 2\n     3, 2\n     ```\n   - The coordinates for the grid are:\n     - (0,0) = 1\n     - (0,1) = 2\n     - (1,0) = 3\n     - (1,1) = 2\n   - We are given that the number 2 at position (0,1) is already selected.\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - We need to select two more numbers such that:\n     - The sum of the selected numbers in each row is ≤ 4.\n     - The sum of the selected numbers in each column is ≤ 4.\n\n3. **Selection Process:**\n   - Since (0,1) is already selected, we need to select two more numbers from the remaining positions: (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1).\n   - We need to ensure that the selected numbers are different. The numbers in the grid are 1, 2, and 3.\n\n4. **Possible Selections:**\n   - Let's consider selecting the number at (0,0) which is 1:\n     - Selected numbers: 2 (at 0,1) and 1 (at 0,0).\n     - We need one more number, and it must be different from 1 and 2, so we select 3 (at 1,0).\n     - Selected numbers are now: 2 (at 0,1), 1 (at 0,0), and 3 (at 1,0).\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   - Check the sum for each row and column:\n     - Row 0: 1 (at 0,0) + 2 (at 0,1) = 3 (≤ 4)\n     - Row 1: 3 (at 1,0) = 3 (≤ 4)\n     - Column 0: 1 (at 0,0) + 3 (at 1,0) = 4 (≤ 4)\n     - Column 1: 2 (at 0,1) = 2 (≤ 4)\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The selection satisfies all the constraints.\n   - The selected positions are (0,0), (0,1), and (1,0).\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<0 0, 0 1, 1 0>>>"
