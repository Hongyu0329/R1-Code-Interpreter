    "To solve this problem, we need to select 12 different numbers from the 6x6 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We start by selecting the number 3 at position (0,5) as given.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Selection:**\n   - Start with the number 3 at position (0,5).\n\n2. **Understanding the Grid:**\n   - The grid is 6x6, and we need to select 12 numbers.\n   - The product of numbers in each row and column must be positive, meaning it should be either all positive or an even number of negative numbers.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - We need to ensure that each row and column with selected numbers has a positive product.\n   - We can achieve this by selecting an even number of negative numbers in each row and column or all positive numbers.\n\n4. **Selection Process:**\n   - We will select numbers ensuring that each row and column has a positive product.\n   - We will start by selecting numbers in the same row and column as the initial number (0,5) and then proceed to other rows and columns.\n\n5. **Row and Column Analysis:**\n   - **Row 0:** Already has 3 at (0,5). We need to select more numbers ensuring a positive product.\n   - **Column 5:** Already has 3 at (0,5). We need to select more numbers ensuring a positive product.\n\n6. **Selection:**\n   - **Row 0:** Select numbers at (0,0) = 8, (0,2) = 7, (0,3) = 6. This gives us a positive product for row 0.\n   - **Column 5:** Select numbers at (1,5) = 8, (4,5) = 11. This gives us a positive product for column 5.\n   - **Row 1:** Select numbers at (1,0) = 11, (1,2) = 7. This gives us a positive product for row 1.\n   - **Row 2:** Select numbers at (2,2) = 10, (2,4) = 4. This gives us a positive product for row 2.\n   - **Row 3:** Select numbers at (3,0) = 3, (3,1) = 10. This gives us a positive product for row 3.\n\n7. **Verification:**\n   - Ensure that each row and column with selected numbers has a positive product.\n   - Check that we have selected exactly 12 numbers.\n\n8. **Final Selection:**\n   - The selected positions are: (0,0), (0,2), (0,3), (0,5), (1,0), (1,2), (1,5), (2,2), (2,4), (3,0), (3,1), (4,5).\n\n### Final Answer:\n<<<0 0, 0 2, 0 3, 0 5, 1 0, 1 2, 1 5, 2 2, 2 4, 3 0, 3 1, 4 5>>>"
