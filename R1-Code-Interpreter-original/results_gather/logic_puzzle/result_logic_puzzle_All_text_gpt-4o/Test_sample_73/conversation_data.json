    "To solve this problem, we need to select 10 different numbers from the 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number -6 at position (0,4) is already selected. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Grid and Initial Selection:**\n   - The grid is:\n     ```\n     -8, 2, -9, 9, -6\n     4, 2, -2, 7, 7\n     -7, 6, 8, -4, -5\n     10, -1, -7, 4, 1\n     -8, -9, 3, 7, 10\n     ```\n   - The first selected number is -6 at position (0,4).\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - We need to select 10 numbers in total.\n   - The product of selected numbers in each row and column must be greater than 0, meaning it must be positive.\n   - A positive product can be achieved by selecting an even number of negative numbers or all positive numbers in each row and column.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Since -6 is already selected, we need to ensure that the product of the selected numbers in row 0 and column 4 is positive.\n   - We need to select numbers such that each row and column has an even number of negative numbers or all positive numbers.\n\n4. **Selection Process:**\n   - **Row 0:** We have -6 selected. To make the product positive, we need to select an odd number of additional negative numbers or all positive numbers. Let's select -8 (0,0) and -9 (0,2) to make the product positive.\n   - **Row 1:** Select 4 (1,0) and 7 (1,3) to ensure a positive product.\n   - **Row 2:** Select 6 (2,1) and 8 (2,2) to ensure a positive product.\n   - **Row 3:** Select 10 (3,0) and 4 (3,3) to ensure a positive product.\n   - **Row 4:** Select 3 (4,2) and 10 (4,4) to ensure a positive product.\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   - **Row 0:** Selected numbers are -8, -9, -6. Product = (-8) * (-9) * (-6) = -432. (Odd number of negatives, product is negative, need to adjust)\n   - **Row 1:** Selected numbers are 4, 7. Product = 28. (Positive)\n   - **Row 2:** Selected numbers are 6, 8. Product = 48. (Positive)\n   - **Row 3:** Selected numbers are 10, 4. Product = 40. (Positive)\n   - **Row 4:** Selected numbers are 3, 10. Product = 30. (Positive)\n\n   Adjust row 0 by selecting 9 (0,3) instead of -9 (0,2) to make the product positive:\n   - **Row 0:** Selected numbers are -8, 9, -6. Product = (-8) * 9 * (-6) = 432. (Positive)\n\n6. **Final Selection:**\n   - Ensure that each column also has a positive product:\n     - **Column 0:** Selected numbers are -8, 4, 10. Product = (-8) * 4 * 10 = -320. (Negative, need to adjust)\n     - **Column 1:** Selected numbers are 6. Product = 6. (Positive)\n     - **Column 2:** Selected numbers are 3, 8. Product = 24. (Positive)\n     - **Column 3:** Selected numbers are 9, 7, 4. Product = 252. (Positive)\n     - **Column 4:** Selected numbers are -6, 7, 10. Product = -420. (Negative, need to adjust)\n\n   Adjust column 0 by selecting -7 (2,0) instead of 10 (3,0) to make the product positive:\n   - **Column 0:** Selected numbers are -8, 4, -7. Product = (-8) * 4 * (-7) = 224. (Positive)\n\n   Adjust column 4 by selecting 1 (3,4) instead of 10 (4,4) to make the product positive:\n   - **Column 4:** Selected numbers are -6, 7, 1. Product = -42. (Negative, need to adjust)\n\n   Adjust column 4 by selecting 7 (4,3) instead of 1 (3,4) to make the product positive:\n   - **Column 4:** Selected numbers are -6, 7, 7. Product = 294. (Positive)\n\n7. **Final Answer:**\n   - The selected positions are: <<<0 0, 0 3, 0 4, 1 0, 1 3, 2 1, 2 2, 3 3, 4 2, 4 3>>>"
