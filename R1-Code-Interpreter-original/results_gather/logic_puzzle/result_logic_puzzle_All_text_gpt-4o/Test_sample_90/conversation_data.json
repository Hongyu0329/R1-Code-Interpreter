    "To solve this problem, we need to select 12 different numbers from the 6x6 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number -10 in the top-rightmost square (0,5) is the first selected number. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Grid and Constraints:**\n   - We have a 6x6 grid with numbers ranging from -10 to 12.\n   - We need to select 12 numbers such that the product of numbers in each row and column is greater than 0.\n   - The product being greater than 0 implies that the product must be positive, which means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n\n2. **Initial Selection:**\n   - We start with the number -10 at position (0,5).\n\n3. **Strategy for Selection:**\n   - Since we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column, we should aim to balance the selection of negative and positive numbers.\n   - We need to ensure that each row and column with selected numbers has an even number of negative numbers.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Selection:**\n   - **Row 0:** We have already selected -10 at (0,5). To make the product positive, we need another negative number in this row. Select -9 at (0,3).\n   - **Row 1:** Select 11 at (1,5) and 7 at (1,4) to keep the product positive.\n   - **Row 2:** Select 12 at (2,3) and 12 at (2,4) to keep the product positive.\n   - **Row 3:** Select 12 at (3,5) and 8 at (3,4) to keep the product positive.\n   - **Row 4:** Select 10 at (4,5) and -5 at (4,4) to keep the product positive.\n   - **Row 5:** Select 12 at (5,5) and 9 at (5,4) to keep the product positive.\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   - **Row 0:** (-9, -10) -> Product is positive.\n   - **Row 1:** (7, 11) -> Product is positive.\n   - **Row 2:** (12, 12) -> Product is positive.\n   - **Row 3:** (8, 12) -> Product is positive.\n   - **Row 4:** (-5, 10) -> Product is positive.\n   - **Row 5:** (9, 12) -> Product is positive.\n   - **Column 3:** (-9, 12) -> Product is positive.\n   - **Column 4:** (7, 12, 8, -5, 9) -> Product is positive.\n   - **Column 5:** (-10, 11, 12, 12, 10, 12) -> Product is positive.\n\n6. **Final Selection:**\n   - The selected positions are: (0,3), (0,5), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,4), (4,5), (5,4), (5,5).\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 3, 0 5, 1 4, 1 5, 2 3, 2 4, 3 4, 3 5, 4 4, 4 5, 5 4, 5 5>>>"
