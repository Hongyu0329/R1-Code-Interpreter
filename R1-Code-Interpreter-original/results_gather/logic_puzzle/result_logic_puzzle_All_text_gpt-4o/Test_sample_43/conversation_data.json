    "To solve this problem, we need to select 6 different numbers from the 4x4 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 6 in the top-rightmost square (0,3) is the first selected number. Let's analyze the grid and the constraints step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis:**\n   ```\n   7, -3, 5, 6\n   6, 6, -3, 2\n   4, 4, 5, -4\n   2, 8, 8, 7\n   ```\n\n2. **Initial Selection:**\n   - We start with the number 6 at position (0,3).\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - We need to select 6 numbers in total.\n   - The product of numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers must be greater than 0.\n   - This implies that the product must be positive, which means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers.\n\n4. **Strategy:**\n   - We need to ensure that the product of numbers in each row and column is positive.\n   - We will try to balance the selection of positive and negative numbers to achieve this.\n\n5. **Selection Process:**\n   - Start with (0,3) = 6.\n   - Select (0,0) = 7 to ensure a positive product in row 0.\n   - Select (1,0) = 6 to ensure a positive product in column 0.\n   - Select (1,1) = 6 to ensure a positive product in row 1.\n   - Select (2,2) = 5 to ensure a positive product in column 2.\n   - Select (3,3) = 7 to ensure a positive product in column 3.\n\n6. **Verification:**\n   - Row 0: 7, 6 (Product = 42, positive)\n   - Row 1: 6, 6 (Product = 36, positive)\n   - Row 2: 5 (Product = 5, positive)\n   - Row 3: 7 (Product = 7, positive)\n   - Column 0: 7, 6 (Product = 42, positive)\n   - Column 1: 6 (Product = 6, positive)\n   - Column 2: 5 (Product = 5, positive)\n   - Column 3: 6, 7 (Product = 42, positive)\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - All selected numbers satisfy the condition that the product of numbers in each row and column is positive.\n\nThe selected positions are: <<<0 3, 0 0, 1 0, 1 1, 2 2, 3 3>>>."
