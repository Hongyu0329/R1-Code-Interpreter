    "To solve this problem, we need to select 9 different numbers from the 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number -6 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Grid and Constraints:**\n   - The grid is 5x5, and we need to select 9 numbers.\n   - The product of numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers must be greater than 0, meaning the product must be positive.\n   - A positive product can be achieved if there is an even number of negative numbers or all numbers are positive.\n\n2. **Initial Selection:**\n   - We start with the number -6 at position (0,4).\n\n3. **Strategy for Selection:**\n   - We need to ensure that each row and column with selected numbers has a positive product.\n   - We should aim to balance the number of negative numbers in each row and column to ensure an even count or use positive numbers.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Selection:**\n   - **Row 0:** We have -6 at (0,4). To make the product positive, we need an even number of negative numbers. We can select 1 at (0,3) and 8 at (0,1).\n   - **Row 1:** We can select 7 at (1,1) and 5 at (1,3). This gives us a positive product for row 1.\n   - **Row 2:** We can select 3 at (2,0) and 3 at (2,3). This gives us a positive product for row 2.\n   - **Row 3:** We can select 4 at (3,1) and 8 at (3,2). This gives us a positive product for row 3.\n   - **Row 4:** We do not need to select any numbers from row 4 as we have already selected 9 numbers.\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   - **Column 0:** We have 3 at (2,0). Positive product.\n   - **Column 1:** We have 8 at (0,1) and 7 at (1,1) and 4 at (3,1). Positive product.\n   - **Column 2:** We have 8 at (3,2). Positive product.\n   - **Column 3:** We have 1 at (0,3), 5 at (1,3), and 3 at (2,3). Positive product.\n   - **Column 4:** We have -6 at (0,4). Positive product as it is the only number.\n\n6. **Final Selection:**\n   - The selected positions are: (0,1), (0,3), (0,4), (1,1), (1,3), (2,0), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2).\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 1, 0 3, 0 4, 1 1, 1 3, 2 0, 2 3, 3 1, 3 2>>>"
