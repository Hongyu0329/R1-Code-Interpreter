    "To solve this problem, we need to select three different numbers from a 2x2 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) is already selected. Let's analyze the grid and the constraints step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Layout and Initial Selection:**\n   - The grid is:\n     ```\n     1, 2\n     3, 3\n     ```\n   - The coordinates for the grid are:\n     ```\n     (0,0), (0,1)\n     (1,0), (1,1)\n     ```\n   - We are given that the number 2 at position (0,1) is already selected.\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - We need to select two more numbers such that:\n     - The sum of the selected numbers in each row is ≤ 4.\n     - The sum of the selected numbers in each column is ≤ 4.\n   - We must select three different numbers.\n\n3. **Possible Selections:**\n   - The numbers available in the grid are 1, 2, and 3.\n   - We have already selected 2 at position (0,1).\n\n4. **Selecting Additional Numbers:**\n   - We need to select two more numbers from the remaining cells: (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1).\n   - The numbers at these positions are:\n     - (0,0): 1\n     - (1,0): 3\n     - (1,1): 3\n\n5. **Checking Constraints:**\n   - If we select 1 at (0,0) and 3 at (1,0), the selections are:\n     - Row 0: 1 (at 0,0) + 2 (at 0,1) = 3 (which is ≤ 4)\n     - Row 1: 3 (at 1,0) = 3 (which is ≤ 4)\n     - Column 0: 1 (at 0,0) + 3 (at 1,0) = 4 (which is ≤ 4)\n     - Column 1: 2 (at 0,1) = 2 (which is ≤ 4)\n   - This selection satisfies all the constraints.\n\n6. **Final Selection:**\n   - The selected numbers are at positions (0,0), (0,1), and (1,0).\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<0 0, 0 1, 1 0>>>"
