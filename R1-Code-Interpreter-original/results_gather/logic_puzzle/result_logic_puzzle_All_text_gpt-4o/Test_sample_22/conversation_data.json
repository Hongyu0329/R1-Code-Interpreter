    "To solve this problem, we need to select four different numbers from the given 3x3 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 1 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) is already selected. Let's analyze the grid and the constraints step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis:**\n   - The grid is:\n     ```\n     3, 4, 1\n     4, 4, 2\n     3, 3, 1\n     ```\n   - The coordinates for each cell are:\n     ```\n     (0,0), (0,1), (0,2)\n     (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)\n     (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n     ```\n\n2. **Initial Selection:**\n   - We are given that the number 1 at position (0,2) is selected.\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - We need to select three more numbers such that:\n     - The sum of the selected numbers in each row is ≤ 4.\n     - The sum of the selected numbers in each column is ≤ 4.\n   - We must select four different numbers.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Selection:**\n   - **Row 0:** We have already selected 1 at (0,2). The remaining numbers in this row are 3 and 4. We cannot select both because their sum would exceed 4. We cannot select any more numbers from this row because the sum would exceed 4.\n   - **Row 1:** The numbers are 4, 4, and 2. We can select the number 2 at (1,2) because it is different from 1 and does not exceed the sum constraint for the column.\n   - **Row 2:** The numbers are 3, 3, and 1. We can select the number 3 at (2,0) because it is different from 1 and 2, and it does not exceed the sum constraint for the row or column.\n   - **Final Selection:** We need one more number. We can select the number 1 at (2,2) because it is different from the other selected numbers and does not exceed the sum constraint for the row or column.\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   - **Row 0:** Selected number is 1. Sum = 1 ≤ 4.\n   - **Row 1:** Selected number is 2. Sum = 2 ≤ 4.\n   - **Row 2:** Selected numbers are 3 and 1. Sum = 3 + 1 = 4 ≤ 4.\n   - **Column 0:** Selected number is 3. Sum = 3 ≤ 4.\n   - **Column 1:** No selected numbers. Sum = 0 ≤ 4.\n   - **Column 2:** Selected numbers are 1, 2, and 1. Sum = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 ≤ 4.\n\nThe selected numbers are at positions (0,2), (1,2), (2,0), and (2,2).\n\nFinal answer: <<<0 2, 1 2, 2 0, 2 2>>>"
