    "To solve this problem, we need to select 10 different numbers from the 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 5 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number. Let's analyze the grid and select the numbers step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis:**\n   ```\n   10,  8,  3, -9,  5\n   -2,  5,  7, 10,  2\n    9,  6,  4, -4,  9\n    4,  4, -6,  4,  1\n    8, -9, -9, 10,  4\n   ```\n\n2. **Initial Selection:**\n   - We start with the number 5 at position (0,4).\n\n3. **Selecting Numbers:**\n   - We need to ensure that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive. This means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n\n4. **Row and Column Analysis:**\n   - **Row 0:** We have selected 5 at (0,4). We need to select numbers such that the product is positive. We can select 10 at (0,0) and 8 at (0,1) to ensure a positive product.\n   - **Row 1:** We can select 5 at (1,1) and 7 at (1,2) to ensure a positive product.\n   - **Row 2:** We can select 9 at (2,0) and 4 at (2,2) to ensure a positive product.\n   - **Row 3:** We can select 4 at (3,0) and 4 at (3,1) to ensure a positive product.\n   - **Row 4:** We can select 8 at (4,0) and 10 at (4,3) to ensure a positive product.\n\n5. **Column Analysis:**\n   - **Column 0:** We have selected 10 at (0,0), 9 at (2,0), and 8 at (4,0). The product is positive.\n   - **Column 1:** We have selected 8 at (0,1), 5 at (1,1), and 4 at (3,1). The product is positive.\n   - **Column 2:** We have selected 7 at (1,2) and 4 at (2,2). The product is positive.\n   - **Column 3:** We have selected 10 at (4,3). We need to ensure the product is positive, so we select 4 at (3,3).\n   - **Column 4:** We have selected 5 at (0,4). We need to ensure the product is positive, so we select 9 at (2,4).\n\n6. **Final Selection:**\n   - The selected numbers are at positions: (0,0), (0,1), (0,4), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (4,0).\n\n7. **Verification:**\n   - Verify that each row and column has a positive product with the selected numbers.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 0, 0 1, 0 4, 1 1, 1 2, 2 0, 2 2, 3 0, 3 1, 4 0>>>"
