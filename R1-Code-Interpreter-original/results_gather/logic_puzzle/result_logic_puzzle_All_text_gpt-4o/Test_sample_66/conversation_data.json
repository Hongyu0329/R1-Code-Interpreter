    "To solve this problem, we need to select 10 different numbers from the 5x5 grid such that the product of the numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 8 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number. Let's analyze the grid and select the numbers step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis:**\n   ```\n   6, -8, -3, 9, 8\n   4, 8, 9, 3, -8\n   9, 4, 5, 2, 1\n   -4, -2, -4, 2, 7\n   1, -3, 9, 1, -10\n   ```\n\n2. **Initial Selection:**\n   - We start with the number 8 at position (0,4).\n\n3. **Row and Column Product Requirements:**\n   - We need to ensure that the product of the selected numbers in each row and column is greater than 0. This means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column or all positive numbers.\n\n4. **Selection Strategy:**\n   - We will select numbers such that each row and column has an even number of negative numbers or all positive numbers.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Selection:**\n   - **Row 0:** We have selected 8 at (0,4). We can select 6 at (0,0) and 9 at (0,3) to ensure the product is positive.\n   - **Row 1:** Select 8 at (1,1) and 9 at (1,2) to ensure the product is positive.\n   - **Row 2:** Select 9 at (2,0) and 5 at (2,2) to ensure the product is positive.\n   - **Row 3:** Select 2 at (3,3) and 7 at (3,4) to ensure the product is positive.\n   - **Row 4:** Select 9 at (4,2) and 1 at (4,3) to ensure the product is positive.\n\n6. **Verification:**\n   - **Column 0:** Selected numbers are 6 (0,0) and 9 (2,0) - product is positive.\n   - **Column 1:** Selected numbers are 8 (1,1) - product is positive.\n   - **Column 2:** Selected numbers are 9 (1,2), 5 (2,2), and 9 (4,2) - product is positive.\n   - **Column 3:** Selected numbers are 9 (0,3), 2 (3,3), and 1 (4,3) - product is positive.\n   - **Column 4:** Selected numbers are 8 (0,4) and 7 (3,4) - product is positive.\n\n7. **Final Selection:**\n   - The selected positions are: (0,0), (0,3), (0,4), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2).\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 0, 0 3, 0 4, 1 1, 1 2, 2 0, 2 2, 3 3, 3 4, 4 2>>>"
