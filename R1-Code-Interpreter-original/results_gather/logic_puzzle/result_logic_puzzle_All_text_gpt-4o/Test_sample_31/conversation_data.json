    "To solve this problem, we need to select four different numbers from the given 3x3 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) is already selected. Let's analyze the grid and the constraints step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis:**\n   ```\n   2, 1, 2\n   3, 1, 3\n   4, 2, 2\n   ```\n\n2. **Selected Number:**\n   - We start with the number 2 at position (0,2).\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - We need to select three more numbers such that:\n     - The sum of the selected numbers in each row is ≤ 4.\n     - The sum of the selected numbers in each column is ≤ 4.\n   - We must select four different numbers.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Selection:**\n   - **Row 0:** We have already selected 2 at (0,2). The remaining numbers in this row are 2 and 1. We cannot select both because 2 + 1 = 3, and adding another number would exceed 4. So, we can only select one more number from this row.\n   - **Row 1:** The numbers are 3, 1, and 3. We can select 1 because selecting 3 would exceed the sum constraint when combined with other numbers.\n   - **Row 2:** The numbers are 4, 2, and 2. We can select 2 because selecting 4 would exceed the sum constraint when combined with other numbers.\n\n5. **Selection:**\n   - From Row 0, we select 1 at (0,1).\n   - From Row 1, we select 1 at (1,1).\n   - From Row 2, we select 2 at (2,1).\n\n6. **Verification:**\n   - **Row 0:** Selected numbers are 2 (at 0,2) and 1 (at 0,1). Sum = 3.\n   - **Row 1:** Selected number is 1 (at 1,1). Sum = 1.\n   - **Row 2:** Selected number is 2 (at 2,1). Sum = 2.\n   - **Column 0:** No numbers selected. Sum = 0.\n   - **Column 1:** Selected numbers are 1 (at 0,1), 1 (at 1,1), and 2 (at 2,1). Sum = 4.\n   - **Column 2:** Selected number is 2 (at 0,2). Sum = 2.\n\nAll constraints are satisfied, and we have selected four different numbers.\n\nThe selected positions are: <<<0 2, 0 1, 1 1, 2 1>>>."
