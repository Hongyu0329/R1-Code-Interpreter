  "question": "Given a 7*7 grid where each cell contains a number (between -13 to 14), you must select 16 different numbers from these cells. The product of each row and column of the selected number must be greater than 0.

    "To solve this problem, we need to select 16 different numbers from the 7x7 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We start by selecting the number 7 at position (0,6) as given.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Selection**: Start with the number 7 at position (0,6).\n\n2. **Understanding the Grid**: \n   - The grid is 7x7, and we need to select 16 numbers.\n   - The product of numbers in each row and column must be positive, which means the product must be either all positive numbers or an even number of negative numbers.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - We need to ensure that each row and column with selected numbers has a positive product.\n   - We can achieve this by selecting an even number of negative numbers in each row and column or all positive numbers.\n\n4. **Selection Process**:\n   - Start by selecting numbers in a way that balances the negatives and positives in each row and column.\n   - Since we have already selected (0,6), we need to select numbers in the same row and column to ensure a positive product.\n\n5. **Row and Column Analysis**:\n   - **Row 0**: We have 7 at (0,6). We need to select more numbers in this row to ensure a positive product.\n   - **Column 6**: We have 7 at (0,6). We need to select more numbers in this column to ensure a positive product.\n\n6. **Selection**:\n   - **Row 0**: Select numbers such that the product is positive. We can select 10 at (0,0), -10 at (0,1), and -5 at (0,2). This gives us a positive product for row 0.\n   - **Column 6**: Select numbers such that the product is positive. We can select 6 at (1,6), 5 at (3,6), and 3 at (4,6). This gives us a positive product for column 6.\n\n7. **Continue Selection**:\n   - **Row 1**: Select 13 at (1,0) and 14 at (1,1) to ensure a positive product.\n   - **Row 2**: Select 2 at (2,0) and 12 at (2,5) to ensure a positive product.\n   - **Row 3**: Select 14 at (3,1) and 12 at (3,2) to ensure a positive product.\n   - **Row 4**: Select 10 at (4,0) and 1 at (4,1) to ensure a positive product.\n   - **Row 5**: Select 8 at (5,0) and 2 at (5,1) to ensure a positive product.\n   - **Row 6**: Select 13 at (6,0) and 1 at (6,1) to ensure a positive product.\n\n8. **Verification**:\n   - Ensure that each row and column with selected numbers has a positive product.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe selected positions are:\n<<<0 0, 0 1, 0 2, 0 6, 1 0, 1 1, 1 6, 2 0, 2 5, 3 1, 3 2, 3 6, 4 0, 4 1, 5 0, 5 1>>>"
