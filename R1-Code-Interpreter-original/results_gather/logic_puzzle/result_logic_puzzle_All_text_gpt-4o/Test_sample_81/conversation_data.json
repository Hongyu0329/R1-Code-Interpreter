    "To solve this problem, we need to select 12 different numbers from the 6x6 grid such that the product of the selected numbers in each row and column is greater than 0. We start by selecting the number 11 at position (0,5) as given.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Selection**: Start with the number 11 at position (0,5).\n\n2. **Row and Column Product Requirement**: For each row and column, the product of the selected numbers must be greater than 0. This means:\n   - The product must be positive.\n   - We can achieve this by selecting an even number of negative numbers or all positive numbers in each row and column.\n\n3. **Grid Analysis**:\n   - **Row 0**: Already selected 11 at (0,5). We need to select one more number from this row. Choose 9 at (0,1) to keep the product positive.\n   - **Row 1**: Select 10 at (1,0) and 9 at (1,2) to keep the product positive.\n   - **Row 2**: Select 11 at (2,1) and 9 at (2,2) to keep the product positive.\n   - **Row 3**: Select 4 at (3,0) and 10 at (3,5) to keep the product positive.\n   - **Row 4**: Select 11 at (4,0) and 7 at (4,5) to keep the product positive.\n   - **Row 5**: Select 6 at (5,2) and 5 at (5,4) to keep the product positive.\n\n4. **Column Analysis**:\n   - **Column 0**: Selected numbers are 10 at (1,0), 4 at (3,0), and 11 at (4,0). Product is positive.\n   - **Column 1**: Selected numbers are 9 at (0,1) and 11 at (2,1). Product is positive.\n   - **Column 2**: Selected numbers are 9 at (1,2), 9 at (2,2), and 6 at (5,2). Product is positive.\n   - **Column 3**: No numbers selected, so no need to check.\n   - **Column 4**: Selected numbers are 5 at (5,4). Product is positive.\n   - **Column 5**: Selected numbers are 11 at (0,5), 10 at (3,5), and 7 at (4,5). Product is positive.\n\n5. **Verification**: Ensure that each row and column with selected numbers has a positive product.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe selected positions are:\n<<<0 5, 0 1, 1 0, 1 2, 2 1, 2 2, 3 0, 3 5, 4 0, 4 5, 5 2, 5 4>>>"
