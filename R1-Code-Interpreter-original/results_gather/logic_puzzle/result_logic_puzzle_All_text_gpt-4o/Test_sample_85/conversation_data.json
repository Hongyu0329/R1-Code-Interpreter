    "To solve this problem, we need to select 12 different numbers from the 6x6 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We start with the number 9 at position (0,5) as the first selected number. The goal is to ensure that the product of the selected numbers in each row and column is positive, which means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n\nLet's analyze the grid and select the numbers step by step:\n\n1. **Start with the given number:**\n   - (0,5) = 9 (positive)\n\n2. **Select numbers from the first row:**\n   - We already have (0,5) = 9.\n   - To ensure a positive product, we can select two more positive numbers from the first row.\n   - Select (0,3) = 1 and (0,4) = 7.\n\n3. **Select numbers from the second row:**\n   - We need an even number of negative numbers.\n   - Select (1,1) = 10 (positive) and (1,5) = 6 (positive).\n\n4. **Select numbers from the third row:**\n   - Select (2,0) = 12 (positive) and (2,4) = 11 (positive).\n\n5. **Select numbers from the fourth row:**\n   - Select (3,1) = 12 (positive) and (3,4) = 7 (positive).\n\n6. **Select numbers from the fifth row:**\n   - Select (4,0) = 12 (positive) and (4,4) = 12 (positive).\n\n7. **Select numbers from the sixth row:**\n   - Select (5,5) = 9 (positive).\n\nNow, let's verify the selection:\n\n- **Row 0:** (0,3) = 1, (0,4) = 7, (0,5) = 9. Product = 1 * 7 * 9 = 63 (positive).\n- **Row 1:** (1,1) = 10, (1,5) = 6. Product = 10 * 6 = 60 (positive).\n- **Row 2:** (2,0) = 12, (2,4) = 11. Product = 12 * 11 = 132 (positive).\n- **Row 3:** (3,1) = 12, (3,4) = 7. Product = 12 * 7 = 84 (positive).\n- **Row 4:** (4,0) = 12, (4,4) = 12. Product = 12 * 12 = 144 (positive).\n- **Row 5:** (5,5) = 9. Product = 9 (positive).\n\n- **Column 0:** (2,0) = 12, (4,0) = 12. Product = 12 * 12 = 144 (positive).\n- **Column 1:** (1,1) = 10, (3,1) = 12. Product = 10 * 12 = 120 (positive).\n- **Column 3:** (0,3) = 1. Product = 1 (positive).\n- **Column 4:** (0,4) = 7, (2,4) = 11, (3,4) = 7, (4,4) = 12. Product = 7 * 11 * 7 * 12 = 6468 (positive).\n- **Column 5:** (0,5) = 9, (1,5) = 6, (5,5) = 9. Product = 9 * 6 * 9 = 486 (positive).\n\nAll row and column products are positive, and we have selected 12 numbers.\n\nThe selected positions are:\n<<<0 3, 0 4, 0 5, 1 1, 1 5, 2 0, 2 4, 3 1, 3 4, 4 0, 4 4, 5 5>>>"
