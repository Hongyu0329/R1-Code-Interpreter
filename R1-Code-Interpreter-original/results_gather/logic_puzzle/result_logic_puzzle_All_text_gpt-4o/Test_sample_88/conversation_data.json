    "To solve this problem, we need to select 12 different numbers from the 6x6 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We start by selecting the number -9 at position (0,5) as given.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Selection**: Start with the number -9 at position (0,5).\n\n2. **Understanding the Grid**:\n   - The grid is 6x6, and we need to select 12 numbers.\n   - The product of numbers in each row and column must be positive, meaning it must be either all positive or an even number of negative numbers.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - We need to ensure that each row and column with selected numbers has a positive product.\n   - Since we have already selected a negative number (-9), we need to balance it with another negative number in the same row or column or ensure an even number of negative numbers in the row and column.\n\n4. **Selection Process**:\n   - **Row 0**: We have -9 at (0,5). To make the product positive, we need another negative number in this row. Select -7 at (0,0).\n   - **Column 5**: We have -9 at (0,5). To make the product positive, we need another negative number in this column. Select -8 at (5,5).\n   - **Row 5**: We have -8 at (5,5). To make the product positive, select 10 at (5,0).\n   - **Column 0**: We have 10 at (5,0). To make the product positive, select -5 at (1,0).\n   - **Row 1**: We have -5 at (1,0). To make the product positive, select 12 at (1,4).\n   - **Column 4**: We have 12 at (1,4). To make the product positive, select 2 at (0,4).\n   - **Row 0**: We have -7, 2, and -9. The product is positive.\n   - **Column 4**: We have 2 and 12. The product is positive.\n   - **Row 1**: We have -5 and 12. The product is positive.\n   - **Column 0**: We have -5 and 10. The product is positive.\n   - **Row 5**: We have 10 and -8. The product is positive.\n   - **Column 5**: We have -9 and -8. The product is positive.\n\n5. **Continue Selection**:\n   - **Row 2**: Select 12 at (2,2) and 7 at (2,3) to ensure a positive product.\n   - **Column 2**: Select 6 at (1,2) to ensure a positive product.\n   - **Row 1**: We have -5, 6, and 12. The product is positive.\n   - **Column 2**: We have 6 and 12. The product is positive.\n   - **Row 2**: We have 12 and 7. The product is positive.\n\n6. **Final Check**:\n   - Ensure all selected numbers form a positive product in their respective rows and columns.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe selected positions are:\n<<<0 0, 0 4, 0 5, 1 0, 1 2, 1 4, 2 2, 2 3, 5 0, 5 5>>>"
