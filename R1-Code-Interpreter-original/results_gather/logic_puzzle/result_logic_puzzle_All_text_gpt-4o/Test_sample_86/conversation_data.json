    "To solve this problem, we need to select 12 different numbers from the 6x6 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 5 in the top-rightmost square (0,5) is the first selected number. Let's analyze the grid and select the numbers step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Selection**: We start with the number 5 at position (0,5).\n\n2. **Row and Column Analysis**:\n   - We need to ensure that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive. This means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column or all positive numbers.\n\n3. **Grid Analysis**:\n   - Row 0: -9, 11, 7, 9, 8, 5\n   - Row 1: 1, 3, -3, -3, -4, 12\n   - Row 2: 1, 7, 6, 11, 10, 2\n   - Row 3: 7, 9, 3, 1, 7, 8\n   - Row 4: 11, -3, 5, 12, 1, 9\n   - Row 5: -3, 8, -1, 6, -5, 5\n\n4. **Selection Strategy**:\n   - We need to select numbers such that each row and column has a positive product.\n   - We start with the number 5 at (0,5). This means we need to select numbers in row 0 and column 5 that ensure a positive product.\n\n5. **Selecting from Row 0**:\n   - We already have 5 at (0,5). We can select positive numbers to ensure a positive product.\n   - Select 11 at (0,1) and 9 at (0,3).\n\n6. **Selecting from Column 5**:\n   - We have 5 at (0,5). We need to select numbers from other rows in column 5.\n   - Select 12 at (1,5), 2 at (2,5), and 8 at (3,5).\n\n7. **Ensuring Positive Product in Other Rows**:\n   - Row 1: Select 3 at (1,1) and 12 at (1,5).\n   - Row 2: Select 7 at (2,1) and 2 at (2,5).\n   - Row 3: Select 9 at (3,1) and 8 at (3,5).\n   - Row 4: Select 11 at (4,0) and 9 at (4,5).\n   - Row 5: Select 8 at (5,1) and 5 at (5,5).\n\n8. **Ensuring Positive Product in Other Columns**:\n   - Column 0: Select 11 at (4,0).\n   - Column 1: Select 11 at (0,1), 3 at (1,1), 7 at (2,1), 9 at (3,1), 8 at (5,1).\n   - Column 2: Select 6 at (2,2).\n   - Column 3: Select 9 at (0,3).\n   - Column 4: Select 10 at (2,4).\n\n9. **Final Selection**:\n   - Ensure that we have selected 12 numbers and that the product of each row and column is positive.\n\nThe selected positions are:\n<<<0 1, 0 3, 0 5, 1 1, 1 5, 2 1, 2 5, 3 1, 3 5, 4 0, 4 5, 5 1>>>"
