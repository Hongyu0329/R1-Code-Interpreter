    "To solve this problem, we need to select 6 different numbers from the given 4x4 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 8 in the top-rightmost square (0,3) is the first selected number. Let's analyze the grid and the constraints step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis:**\n   ```\n   (0,0) -3, (0,1) -4, (0,2) 3, (0,3) 8\n   (1,0) 2,  (1,1) 3,  (1,2) 1, (1,3) -2\n   (2,0) 3,  (2,1) -1, (2,2) -5, (2,3) 5\n   (3,0) -2, (3,1) 3,  (3,2) 6, (3,3) -3\n   ```\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - We must select 6 different numbers.\n   - The product of each row and column of the selected numbers must be greater than 0.\n   - The number 8 at position (0,3) is already selected.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Since the product must be greater than 0, we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers.\n   - We start with the number 8 at (0,3), which is positive.\n\n4. **Selection Process:**\n   - **Row 0:** We have already selected 8 at (0,3). We need to select one more number from this row. To keep the product positive, we can select another positive number, 3 at (0,2).\n   - **Row 1:** We need to select two numbers. We can select 2 at (1,0) and 3 at (1,1), both positive.\n   - **Row 2:** We need to select one number. We can select 5 at (2,3), which is positive.\n   - **Row 3:** We need to select one number. We can select 6 at (3,2), which is positive.\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   - **Row 0:** Selected numbers are 3 and 8. Product = 3 * 8 = 24 > 0.\n   - **Row 1:** Selected numbers are 2 and 3. Product = 2 * 3 = 6 > 0.\n   - **Row 2:** Selected number is 5. Product = 5 > 0.\n   - **Row 3:** Selected number is 6. Product = 6 > 0.\n   - **Column 0:** Selected number is 2. Product = 2 > 0.\n   - **Column 1:** Selected number is 3. Product = 3 > 0.\n   - **Column 2:** Selected numbers are 3 and 6. Product = 3 * 6 = 18 > 0.\n   - **Column 3:** Selected numbers are 8 and 5. Product = 8 * 5 = 40 > 0.\n\nAll conditions are satisfied with the selected numbers.\n\nThe selected positions are: <<<0 3, 0 2, 1 0, 1 1, 2 3, 3 2>>>."
