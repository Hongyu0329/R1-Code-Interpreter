    "To solve this problem, we need to select 6 different numbers from the 4x4 grid such that the product of the numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number -5 in the top-rightmost square (0,3) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's analyze the grid and the constraints step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis:**\n   ```\n   (0,0) 6,  (0,1) 1,  (0,2) -5, (0,3) -5\n   (1,0) 8,  (1,1) -4, (1,2) -4, (1,3) 2\n   (2,0) -4, (2,1) 2,  (2,2) 8,  (2,3) 5\n   (3,0) 4,  (3,1) 8,  (3,2) -2, (3,3) 5\n   ```\n\n2. **Initial Selection:**\n   - We start with the number -5 at position (0,3).\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - We need to select 6 numbers in total.\n   - The product of the numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers must be greater than 0.\n\n4. **Product Constraint:**\n   - A product is greater than 0 if it is positive. This means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers.\n\n5. **Selection Strategy:**\n   - Since we have already selected -5 at (0,3), we need to ensure that the remaining selections balance the negatives to make the product positive.\n\n6. **Step-by-Step Selection:**\n   - **Row 0:** We have -5 at (0,3). To make the product positive, we need another negative number in this row. Select -5 at (0,2).\n   - **Row 1:** Select 8 at (1,0) and 2 at (1,3). The product is 8 * 2 = 16, which is positive.\n   - **Row 2:** Select 2 at (2,1) and 5 at (2,3). The product is 2 * 5 = 10, which is positive.\n   - **Row 3:** Select 4 at (3,0) and 5 at (3,3). The product is 4 * 5 = 20, which is positive.\n\n7. **Column Check:**\n   - **Column 0:** We have 8 at (1,0) and 4 at (3,0). The product is 8 * 4 = 32, which is positive.\n   - **Column 1:** We have 2 at (2,1). This column is not fully selected, so it doesn't affect the product constraint.\n   - **Column 2:** We have -5 at (0,2). This column is not fully selected, so it doesn't affect the product constraint.\n   - **Column 3:** We have -5 at (0,3), 2 at (1,3), and 5 at (2,3). The product is -5 * 2 * 5 = -50, which is negative. We need to adjust this.\n\n8. **Adjustment:**\n   - To fix the column 3 issue, we need to ensure an even number of negative numbers. We can select 5 at (3,3) to balance the negatives.\n\n9. **Final Selection:**\n   - (0,2) -5\n   - (0,3) -5\n   - (1,0) 8\n   - (1,3) 2\n   - (2,1) 2\n   - (3,3) 5\n\n10. **Verification:**\n    - Check each row and column to ensure the product is positive.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 2, 0 3, 1 0, 1 3, 2 1, 3 3>>>"
