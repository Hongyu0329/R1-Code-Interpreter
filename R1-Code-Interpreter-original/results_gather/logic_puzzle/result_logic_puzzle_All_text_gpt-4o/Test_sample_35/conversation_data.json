    "To solve this problem, we need to select 6 different numbers from the 4x4 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 8 in the top-rightmost square (0,3) is the first selected number. Let's analyze the grid and the constraints step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis:**\n   ```\n   (0,0) 1,  (0,1) 3,  (0,2) -3, (0,3) 8\n   (1,0) 8,  (1,1) 7,  (1,2) 8,  (1,3) -3\n   (2,0) 2,  (2,1) 2,  (2,2) -4, (2,3) -1\n   (3,0) 8,  (3,1) 2,  (3,2) 2,  (3,3) 4\n   ```\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - We must select 6 different numbers.\n   - The product of each row and column of the selected numbers must be greater than 0.\n   - The number at (0,3) is already selected.\n\n3. **Initial Selection:**\n   - We start with (0,3) = 8.\n\n4. **Selecting Additional Numbers:**\n   - We need to ensure that the product of numbers in each row and column is positive. This means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column or all positive numbers.\n\n5. **Strategy:**\n   - Since (0,3) is positive, we can select other positive numbers or pairs of negative numbers to ensure the product is positive.\n   - We need to carefully choose numbers to maintain the balance of positive and negative numbers in each row and column.\n\n6. **Selection Process:**\n   - From row 0, we already have (0,3). We can select (0,0) = 1 and (0,1) = 3 to keep the product positive.\n   - From row 1, we can select (1,0) = 8 and (1,2) = 8. This keeps the product positive.\n   - From row 2, we can select (2,0) = 2. This keeps the product positive.\n   - From row 3, we can select (3,0) = 8. This keeps the product positive.\n\n7. **Verification:**\n   - Row 0: (0,0), (0,1), (0,3) = 1, 3, 8 → Product = 24 (positive)\n   - Row 1: (1,0), (1,2) = 8, 8 → Product = 64 (positive)\n   - Row 2: (2,0) = 2 → Product = 2 (positive)\n   - Row 3: (3,0) = 8 → Product = 8 (positive)\n   - Column 0: (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0) = 1, 8, 2, 8 → Product = 128 (positive)\n   - Column 1: (0,1) = 3 → Product = 3 (positive)\n   - Column 2: (1,2) = 8 → Product = 8 (positive)\n   - Column 3: (0,3) = 8 → Product = 8 (positive)\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   - All rows and columns have a positive product with the selected numbers.\n\nThe selected positions are: <<<0 0, 0 1, 0 3, 1 0, 1 2, 2 0>>>."
