    "To solve this problem, we need to select 6 different numbers from the 4x4 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number -1 in the top-rightmost square (0,3) is the first selected number. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**: \n   - The grid is:\n     ```\n     3, -4, 3, -1\n     8, -4, -2, 1\n     7, 4, -4, 2\n     5, 4, 5, 3\n     ```\n   - The coordinates are 0-based, so the top-left cell is (0,0) and the bottom-right cell is (3,3).\n\n2. **Initial Selection**:\n   - We start with the number -1 at position (0,3).\n\n3. **Product Condition**:\n   - We need to ensure that the product of the selected numbers in each row and column is greater than 0. This means the product must be positive, which implies an even number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n\n4. **Selection Strategy**:\n   - Since we have already selected a negative number (-1), we need to select other numbers such that the total number of negative numbers in each row and column is even.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Selection**:\n   - **Row 0**: We have selected -1 at (0,3). To make the product positive, we need another negative number in this row. Select -4 at (0,1).\n   - **Row 1**: Select 8 at (1,0) and 1 at (1,3). The product is positive (8 * 1 = 8).\n   - **Row 2**: Select 7 at (2,0) and 2 at (2,3). The product is positive (7 * 2 = 14).\n   - **Row 3**: Select 5 at (3,0) and 3 at (3,3). The product is positive (5 * 3 = 15).\n\n6. **Column Check**:\n   - **Column 0**: Selected numbers are 8 (1,0), 7 (2,0), and 5 (3,0). The product is positive (8 * 7 * 5 = 280).\n   - **Column 1**: Selected number is -4 (0,1). No other number is selected in this column, so the product condition is not applicable.\n   - **Column 2**: No numbers are selected in this column, so the product condition is not applicable.\n   - **Column 3**: Selected numbers are -1 (0,3), 1 (1,3), 2 (2,3), and 3 (3,3). The product is positive (-1 * 1 * 2 * 3 = -6).\n\n7. **Final Selection**:\n   - The selected positions are: (0,3), (0,1), (1,0), (1,3), (2,0), (2,3).\n\nThe final answer is: <<<0 3, 0 1, 1 0, 1 3, 2 0, 2 3>>>"
