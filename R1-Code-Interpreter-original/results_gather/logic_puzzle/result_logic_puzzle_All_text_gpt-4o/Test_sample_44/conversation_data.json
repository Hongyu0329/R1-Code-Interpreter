    "To solve this problem, we need to select 6 different numbers from the given 4x4 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,3) is the first selected number. Let's analyze the grid and the constraints step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis:**\n   ```\n   7, -2, 4, 2\n   2, 4, 3, 8\n   1, 5, -3, -3\n   2, 7, -4, 6\n   ```\n\n2. **Initial Selection:**\n   - We start with the number 2 at position (0,3).\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - We need to select 6 numbers in total.\n   - The product of selected numbers in each row and column must be greater than 0.\n\n4. **Strategy:**\n   - Since the product must be greater than 0, we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers.\n   - We should aim to select numbers such that the product of each row and column is positive.\n\n5. **Selection Process:**\n   - Start with (0,3) = 2.\n   - We need to select numbers from different rows and columns to ensure the product condition is met.\n\n6. **Row and Column Analysis:**\n   - **Row 0:** We have selected (0,3). We can select (0,0) = 7 to ensure a positive product in row 0.\n   - **Row 1:** Select (1,1) = 4 and (1,2) = 3. This ensures a positive product in row 1.\n   - **Row 2:** Select (2,0) = 1. This ensures a positive product in row 2.\n   - **Row 3:** Select (3,1) = 7. This ensures a positive product in row 3.\n\n7. **Verification:**\n   - **Row 0:** (0,0) = 7 and (0,3) = 2. Product = 14 > 0.\n   - **Row 1:** (1,1) = 4 and (1,2) = 3. Product = 12 > 0.\n   - **Row 2:** (2,0) = 1. Product = 1 > 0.\n   - **Row 3:** (3,1) = 7. Product = 7 > 0.\n   - **Column 0:** (0,0) = 7 and (2,0) = 1. Product = 7 > 0.\n   - **Column 1:** (1,1) = 4 and (3,1) = 7. Product = 28 > 0.\n   - **Column 2:** (1,2) = 3. Product = 3 > 0.\n   - **Column 3:** (0,3) = 2. Product = 2 > 0.\n\n8. **Final Selection:**\n   - The selected positions are (0,3), (0,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), and (3,1).\n\nThe final answer is: <<<0 3, 0 0, 1 1, 1 2, 2 0, 3 1>>>"
