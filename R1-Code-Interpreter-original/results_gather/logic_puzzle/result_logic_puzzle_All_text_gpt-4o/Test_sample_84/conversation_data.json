    "To solve this problem, we need to select 12 different numbers from the 6x6 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 10 in the top-rightmost square (0,5) is the first selected number. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Grid and Constraints:**\n   - We have a 6x6 grid with numbers ranging from -12 to 12.\n   - We need to select 12 numbers such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0.\n   - The number 10 at position (0,5) is already selected.\n\n2. **Product Greater than 0:**\n   - For the product of numbers in a row or column to be greater than 0, the number of negative numbers must be even, or all numbers must be positive.\n\n3. **Initial Selection:**\n   - We start with the number 10 at position (0,5).\n\n4. **Strategy for Selection:**\n   - We need to ensure that each row and column with selected numbers has an even number of negative numbers or all positive numbers.\n   - We will try to balance the selection of positive and negative numbers across rows and columns.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Selection:**\n   - Start with the given number at (0,5).\n   - Select numbers from each row and column, ensuring the product condition is met.\n\n6. **Selection Process:**\n   - Row 0: Already have (0,5). Select (0,0) = 12, (0,1) = 2, (0,2) = 8, (0,3) = 9, (0,4) = 4. This row is all positive.\n   - Row 1: Select (1,2) = 10, (1,3) = 2. This row has an even number of negatives.\n   - Row 2: Select (2,1) = 9, (2,2) = 4. This row has an even number of negatives.\n   - Row 3: Select (3,1) = 12, (3,3) = 11. This row has an even number of negatives.\n   - Row 4: Select (4,2) = 11, (4,3) = 3. This row has an even number of negatives.\n   - Row 5: Select (5,0) = 11, (5,4) = 4. This row has an even number of negatives.\n\n7. **Verification:**\n   - Check each column to ensure the product condition is met:\n     - Column 0: (0,0), (5,0) are positive.\n     - Column 1: (0,1), (2,1), (3,1) are positive.\n     - Column 2: (0,2), (1,2), (2,2), (4,2) are positive.\n     - Column 3: (0,3), (1,3), (3,3), (4,3) are positive.\n     - Column 4: (0,4), (5,4) are positive.\n     - Column 5: (0,5) is positive.\n\n8. **Final Selection:**\n   - The selected positions are: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (3,3).\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 0, 0 1, 0 2, 0 3, 0 4, 0 5, 1 2, 1 3, 2 1, 2 2, 3 1, 3 3>>>"
