    "To solve this problem, we need to select 12 different numbers from the 6x6 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 11 in the top-rightmost square (0,5) is the first selected number. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Grid and Constraints:**\n   - We have a 6x6 grid with numbers ranging from -12 to 12.\n   - We need to select 12 numbers such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0.\n   - The number at position (0,5) is already selected.\n\n2. **Initial Selection:**\n   - Start with the number 11 at position (0,5).\n\n3. **Ensure Positive Product in Rows and Columns:**\n   - For a product to be greater than 0, it must be positive. This means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers.\n   - We need to carefully select numbers to ensure this condition is met.\n\n4. **Select Numbers:**\n   - We need to select numbers such that each row and column has an even number of negative numbers or all positive numbers.\n   - We will select numbers from each row and column, ensuring the product condition is satisfied.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Selection:**\n   - **Row 0:** Already selected (0,5) with number 11.\n   - **Row 1:** Select (1,3) with number 11 and (1,5) with number 8.\n   - **Row 2:** Select (2,0) with number 8 and (2,5) with number 5.\n   - **Row 3:** Select (3,1) with number 12 and (3,2) with number 11.\n   - **Row 4:** Select (4,4) with number 5 and (4,5) with number 12.\n   - **Row 5:** Select (5,4) with number 4 and (5,5) with number 12.\n\n6. **Verify Selection:**\n   - Check each row and column to ensure the product of selected numbers is positive.\n   - Adjust selections if necessary to maintain the condition.\n\n7. **Final Selection:**\n   - After verifying, the selected positions are:\n     - (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (2,0), (2,5), (3,1), (3,2), (4,4), (4,5), (5,4), (5,5).\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 5, 1 3, 1 5, 2 0, 2 5, 3 1, 3 2, 4 4, 4 5, 5 4, 5 5>>>"
