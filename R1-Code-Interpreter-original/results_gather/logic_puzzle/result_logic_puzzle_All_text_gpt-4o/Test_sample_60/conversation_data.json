    "To solve this problem, we need to select 9 different numbers from the 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 8 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number. Let's analyze the grid and the constraints step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis:**\n   - The grid is as follows:\n     ```\n     7, 4, -2, -8, 8\n     2, 2, 4, 4, 1\n     4, -5, 5, -1, 3\n     -5, 3, 6, 4, 2\n     6, 6, -4, -6, 2\n     ```\n   - We need to select 9 numbers such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0.\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - The product of numbers in each row and column must be positive, which means the product must be either all positive numbers or an even number of negative numbers.\n   - We start with the number 8 at position (0,4).\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - We need to ensure that each row and column with selected numbers has a positive product.\n   - We will try to balance the number of negative numbers in each row and column to ensure a positive product.\n\n4. **Selection Process:**\n   - Start with the given number 8 at (0,4).\n   - Select numbers from each row and column, ensuring the product is positive.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Selection:**\n   - **Row 0:** We have 8 at (0,4). We can select 7 at (0,0) and 4 at (0,1) to ensure a positive product.\n   - **Row 1:** Select 2 at (1,0) and 4 at (1,2) to ensure a positive product.\n   - **Row 2:** Select 4 at (2,0) and 5 at (2,2) to ensure a positive product.\n   - **Row 3:** Select 3 at (3,1) and 4 at (3,3) to ensure a positive product.\n   - **Row 4:** Select 6 at (4,0) to ensure a positive product.\n\n6. **Verification:**\n   - **Row 0:** 7, 4, 8 (Product: 224 > 0)\n   - **Row 1:** 2, 4 (Product: 8 > 0)\n   - **Row 2:** 4, 5 (Product: 20 > 0)\n   - **Row 3:** 3, 4 (Product: 12 > 0)\n   - **Row 4:** 6 (Product: 6 > 0)\n   - **Column 0:** 7, 2, 4, 6 (Product: 336 > 0)\n   - **Column 1:** 4, 3 (Product: 12 > 0)\n   - **Column 2:** 4, 5 (Product: 20 > 0)\n   - **Column 3:** 4 (Product: 4 > 0)\n   - **Column 4:** 8 (Product: 8 > 0)\n\n7. **Final Selection:**\n   - The selected positions are: (0,0), (0,1), (0,4), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,1), (4,0).\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 0, 0 1, 0 4, 1 0, 1 2, 2 0, 2 2, 3 1, 4 0>>>"
