    "To solve this problem, we need to select 12 different numbers from the 6x6 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 9 in the top-rightmost square (0,5) is the first selected number. Let's analyze the grid and select the numbers step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Selection**: We start with the number 9 at position (0,5).\n\n2. **Row and Column Analysis**:\n   - We need to ensure that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive. This means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n\n3. **Grid Analysis**:\n   - Row 0: 8, 12, 9, 3, -11, 9\n   - Row 1: 12, -12, -4, 11, 10, 7\n   - Row 2: -8, 6, 9, 10, 1, 3\n   - Row 3: 5, 11, 6, 7, -9, 11\n   - Row 4: 6, 1, 11, 12, 4, -3\n   - Row 5: 2, 9, 4, 3, 10, 9\n\n4. **Selection Strategy**:\n   - We need to select numbers such that each row and column has an even number of negative numbers.\n   - We start with the number 9 at (0,5). This is a positive number.\n\n5. **Selecting Numbers**:\n   - From Row 0, we already have (0,5). We can select (0,0) which is 8, a positive number.\n   - From Row 1, select (1,0) which is 12, a positive number, and (1,3) which is 11, a positive number.\n   - From Row 2, select (2,1) which is 6, a positive number, and (2,3) which is 10, a positive number.\n   - From Row 3, select (3,0) which is 5, a positive number, and (3,3) which is 7, a positive number.\n   - From Row 4, select (4,0) which is 6, a positive number, and (4,3) which is 12, a positive number.\n   - From Row 5, select (5,0) which is 2, a positive number, and (5,3) which is 3, a positive number.\n\n6. **Verification**:\n   - Check each row and column to ensure the product of selected numbers is positive.\n   - Each row and column has an even number of negative numbers (in this case, zero negative numbers), ensuring the product is positive.\n\n7. **Final Selection**:\n   - The selected positions are: (0,5), (0,0), (1,0), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,0), (3,3), (4,0), (4,3), (5,0), (5,3).\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 5, 0 0, 1 0, 1 3, 2 1, 2 3, 3 0, 3 3, 4 0, 4 3, 5 0, 5 3>>>"
