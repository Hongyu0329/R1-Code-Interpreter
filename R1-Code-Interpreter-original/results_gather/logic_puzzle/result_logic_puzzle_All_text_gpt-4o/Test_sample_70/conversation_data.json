    "To solve this problem, we need to select 10 different numbers from the given 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 9 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Grid and Initial Selection:**\n   - The grid is a 5x5 matrix with numbers ranging from -10 to 10.\n   - The first selected number is 9 at position (0,4).\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Select 10 numbers such that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is greater than 0.\n   - This implies that the product must be positive, which can be achieved if there is an even number of negative numbers or all numbers are positive in each row and column.\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - We must select exactly 10 numbers.\n   - The selection must include the number 9 at position (0,4).\n\n4. **Strategy:**\n   - Start by selecting the number 9 at (0,4).\n   - Ensure that each row and column with selected numbers has a positive product.\n   - Consider the distribution of positive and negative numbers in the grid.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Selection:**\n   - **Row 0:** We have already selected 9 at (0,4). To ensure a positive product, we can select 8 at (0,3) because 8 is positive.\n   - **Row 1:** Select 7 at (1,1) and 3 at (1,3). Both are positive, ensuring a positive product.\n   - **Row 2:** Select 4 at (2,2) and 6 at (2,3). Both are positive.\n   - **Row 3:** Select 8 at (3,0) and 10 at (3,2). Both are positive.\n   - **Row 4:** Select 5 at (4,0) and 8 at (4,2). Both are positive.\n\n6. **Verification:**\n   - **Row 0:** Selected numbers are 8 and 9. Product = 8 * 9 = 72 (positive).\n   - **Row 1:** Selected numbers are 7 and 3. Product = 7 * 3 = 21 (positive).\n   - **Row 2:** Selected numbers are 4 and 6. Product = 4 * 6 = 24 (positive).\n   - **Row 3:** Selected numbers are 8 and 10. Product = 8 * 10 = 80 (positive).\n   - **Row 4:** Selected numbers are 5 and 8. Product = 5 * 8 = 40 (positive).\n   - **Column 0:** Selected numbers are 8 and 5. Product = 8 * 5 = 40 (positive).\n   - **Column 1:** Selected number is 7. Product = 7 (positive).\n   - **Column 2:** Selected numbers are 4, 10, and 8. Product = 4 * 10 * 8 = 320 (positive).\n   - **Column 3:** Selected numbers are 8 and 3. Product = 8 * 3 = 24 (positive).\n   - **Column 4:** Selected number is 9. Product = 9 (positive).\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - All rows and columns with selected numbers have a positive product.\n   - We have selected exactly 10 numbers.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 3, 0 4, 1 1, 1 3, 2 2, 2 3, 3 0, 3 2, 4 0, 4 2>>>"
