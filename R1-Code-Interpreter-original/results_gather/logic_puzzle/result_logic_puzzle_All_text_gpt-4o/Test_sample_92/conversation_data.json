  "question": "Given a 6*6 grid where each cell contains a number (between -10 to 12), you must select 12 different numbers from these cells. The product of each row and column of the selected number must be greater than 0.

    "To solve this problem, we need to select 12 different numbers from the 6x6 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We start with the number 2 at position (0,5) as our first selected number. Let's analyze the grid and select numbers step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Selection**: Start with the number 2 at position (0,5).\n\n2. **Row and Column Analysis**:\n   - We need to ensure that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive. This means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column or all positive numbers.\n\n3. **Selecting Numbers**:\n   - **Row 0**: We have already selected 2 at (0,5). We need to select one more number from this row. Choose 11 at (0,4) to keep the product positive.\n   - **Row 1**: Choose 5 at (1,0) and 4 at (1,5). The product is positive.\n   - **Row 2**: Choose 6 at (2,0) and 8 at (2,5). The product is positive.\n   - **Row 3**: Choose 12 at (3,0) and 1 at (3,5). The product is positive.\n   - **Row 4**: Choose 11 at (4,3) and 7 at (4,5). The product is positive.\n   - **Row 5**: Choose 10 at (5,2) and 12 at (5,5). The product is positive.\n\n4. **Column Analysis**:\n   - **Column 0**: We have selected 5, 6, and 12. The product is positive.\n   - **Column 5**: We have selected 2, 4, 8, 1, 7, and 12. The product is positive.\n   - **Column 4**: We have selected 11. The product is positive.\n   - **Column 3**: We have selected 11. The product is positive.\n   - **Column 2**: We have selected 10. The product is positive.\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - Ensure that each row and column with selected numbers has a positive product.\n   - Ensure that we have selected exactly 12 numbers.\n\nBy following these steps, we ensure that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0.\n\nThe selected positions are:\n<<<0 4, 0 5, 1 0, 1 5, 2 0, 2 5, 3 0, 3 5, 4 3, 4 5, 5 2, 5 5>>>"
