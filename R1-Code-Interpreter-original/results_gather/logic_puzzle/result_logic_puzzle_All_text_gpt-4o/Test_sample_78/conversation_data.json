    "To solve this problem, we need to select 10 different numbers from the 5x5 grid such that the product of the selected numbers in each row and column is greater than 0. We are given that the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number. Let's analyze the grid and select the numbers step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Selection**: We start with the number 2 at position (0,4).\n\n2. **Row and Column Analysis**:\n   - **Row 0**: We have selected 2 at (0,4). We need to select other numbers such that their product is positive. We can select 10 at (0,0) and 6 at (0,1) to ensure a positive product for row 0.\n   - **Column 4**: We have selected 2 at (0,4). We need to select other numbers such that their product is positive. We can select 8 at (4,4) to ensure a positive product for column 4.\n\n3. **Continue Selection**:\n   - **Row 1**: We can select 4 at (1,0) and 6 at (1,2) to ensure a positive product for row 1.\n   - **Row 2**: We can select 5 at (2,0) and 6 at (2,2) to ensure a positive product for row 2.\n   - **Row 3**: We can select 7 at (3,0) and 5 at (3,1) to ensure a positive product for row 3.\n   - **Row 4**: We have already selected 8 at (4,4). We can select 6 at (4,1) to ensure a positive product for row 4.\n\n4. **Column Analysis**:\n   - **Column 0**: We have selected 10 at (0,0), 4 at (1,0), 5 at (2,0), and 7 at (3,0). The product is positive.\n   - **Column 1**: We have selected 6 at (0,1), 5 at (3,1), and 6 at (4,1). The product is positive.\n   - **Column 2**: We have selected 6 at (1,2) and 6 at (2,2). The product is positive.\n   - **Column 3**: We have not selected any numbers in column 3, but we have already selected 10 numbers.\n\n5. **Final Check**: Ensure that we have selected exactly 10 numbers and that the product of the selected numbers in each row and column is positive.\n\nThe selected positions are:\n- (0,0), (0,1), (0,4)\n- (1,0), (1,2)\n- (2,0), (2,2)\n- (3,0), (3,1)\n- (4,1), (4,4)\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n<<<0 0, 0 1, 0 4, 1 0, 1 2, 2 0, 2 2, 3 0, 3 1, 4 4>>>"
