    "To solve this problem, we need to select 12 different numbers from the 6x6 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 7 in the top-rightmost square (0,5) is the first selected number. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Grid and Constraints:**\n   - We have a 6x6 grid with numbers ranging from -12 to 12.\n   - We need to select 12 numbers such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0.\n   - The number 7 at position (0,5) is already selected.\n\n2. **Product Greater than 0:**\n   - For the product of numbers in a row or column to be greater than 0, the number of negative numbers must be even, or all numbers must be positive.\n\n3. **Initial Selection:**\n   - Start with the given number 7 at position (0,5).\n\n4. **Strategy for Selection:**\n   - We need to ensure that each row and column has a product greater than 0.\n   - We should aim to select an even number of negative numbers in each row and column or all positive numbers.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Selection:**\n   - **Row 0:** We have already selected (0,5). We need to select more numbers from this row.\n     - Select (0,0) = 2, (0,1) = 8, and (0,4) = 9. This gives us a product of 2 * 8 * 9 * 7 = 1008, which is positive.\n   - **Row 1:** Select (1,0) = 2, (1,1) = 7, and (1,3) = 3. This gives us a product of 2 * 7 * 3 = 42, which is positive.\n   - **Row 2:** Select (2,0) = 9 and (2,1) = 12. This gives us a product of 9 * 12 = 108, which is positive.\n   - **Row 3:** Select (3,0) = 6 and (3,4) = 5. This gives us a product of 6 * 5 = 30, which is positive.\n   - **Row 4:** Select (4,4) = 12. This is a single positive number.\n   - **Row 5:** Select (5,2) = 11. This is a single positive number.\n\n6. **Verification:**\n   - **Column 0:** Selected numbers are (0,0) = 2, (1,0) = 2, (2,0) = 9, (3,0) = 6. Product = 2 * 2 * 9 * 6 = 216, positive.\n   - **Column 1:** Selected numbers are (0,1) = 8, (1,1) = 7, (2,1) = 12. Product = 8 * 7 * 12 = 672, positive.\n   - **Column 3:** Selected numbers are (1,3) = 3. Product = 3, positive.\n   - **Column 4:** Selected numbers are (0,4) = 9, (3,4) = 5, (4,4) = 12. Product = 9 * 5 * 12 = 540, positive.\n   - **Column 5:** Selected number is (0,5) = 7. Product = 7, positive.\n\n7. **Final Selection:**\n   - The selected positions are: (0,0), (0,1), (0,4), (0,5), (1,0), (1,1), (1,3), (2,0), (2,1), (3,0), (3,4), (4,4).\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 0, 0 1, 0 4, 0 5, 1 0, 1 1, 1 3, 2 0, 2 1, 3 0, 3 4, 4 4>>>"
