    "To solve this problem, we need to select 9 different numbers from the 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 5 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Grid and Constraints:**\n   - We have a 5x5 grid with numbers ranging from -7 to 8.\n   - We need to select 9 numbers such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0.\n   - The number at position (0,4) is already selected.\n\n2. **Initial Selection:**\n   - Start with the number at (0,4), which is 5.\n\n3. **Product Constraint:**\n   - For the product of numbers in a row or column to be greater than 0, the product must be positive.\n   - This means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers.\n\n4. **Strategy:**\n   - We need to ensure that each row and column with selected numbers has an even number of negative numbers.\n   - We will try to balance the selection of positive and negative numbers across the grid.\n\n5. **Selection Process:**\n   - Start by selecting numbers in a way that balances the number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n   - We need to ensure that the total number of selected numbers is 9.\n\n6. **Step-by-Step Selection:**\n   - Select (0,4) as given.\n   - Select (0,3) which is 7 (positive).\n   - Select (1,4) which is 3 (positive).\n   - Select (2,4) which is 6 (positive).\n   - Select (3,4) which is -4 (negative).\n   - Select (4,4) which is 3 (positive).\n   - Select (1,0) which is 6 (positive).\n   - Select (2,0) which is 7 (positive).\n   - Select (3,0) which is -4 (negative).\n\n7. **Verification:**\n   - Check each row and column to ensure the product of selected numbers is positive.\n   - Row 0: 5, 7 (positive product)\n   - Row 1: 6, 3 (positive product)\n   - Row 2: 7, 6 (positive product)\n   - Row 3: -4, -4 (positive product)\n   - Row 4: 3 (positive product)\n   - Column 0: 6, 7, -4 (positive product)\n   - Column 3: 7 (positive product)\n   - Column 4: 5, 3, 6, -4, 3 (positive product)\n\n8. **Final Selection:**\n   - The selected positions are: (0,3), (0,4), (1,0), (1,4), (2,0), (2,4), (3,0), (3,4), (4,4).\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 3, 0 4, 1 0, 1 4, 2 0, 2 4, 3 0, 3 4, 4 4>>>"
