    "To solve this problem, we need to select 10 different numbers from the given 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 1 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Grid and Initial Selection:**\n   - The grid is a 5x5 matrix with numbers ranging from -9 to 10.\n   - The first selected number is at position (0,4) with a value of 1.\n\n2. **Objective:**\n   - Select 10 different numbers such that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is greater than 0.\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - The product of numbers in each row and column must be positive.\n   - We must select exactly 10 numbers.\n\n4. **Strategy:**\n   - Since the product must be positive, we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column or all positive numbers.\n   - We need to ensure that the selected numbers are distributed across the grid to satisfy the row and column product conditions.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Selection:**\n   - Start with the given number at (0,4) which is 1.\n   - Select numbers ensuring that each row and column has a positive product.\n\n6. **Selection Process:**\n   - **Row 0:** Already have 1 at (0,4). Select -4 at (0,0) and 5 at (0,3) to make the product positive: (-4) * 5 * 1 = -20 (negative, so we need another negative).\n   - **Row 1:** Select 4 at (1,0) and 5 at (1,3) to make the product positive: 4 * 5 = 20.\n   - **Row 2:** Select 10 at (2,1) and 9 at (2,2) to make the product positive: 10 * 9 = 90.\n   - **Row 3:** Select 3 at (3,0) and 7 at (3,4) to make the product positive: 3 * 7 = 21.\n   - **Row 4:** Select 5 at (4,0) and 6 at (4,2) to make the product positive: 5 * 6 = 30.\n\n7. **Verification:**\n   - Check each column to ensure the product is positive:\n     - **Column 0:** (-4) * 4 * 3 * 5 = -240 (negative, so we need another negative).\n     - **Column 1:** 10 (positive).\n     - **Column 2:** 9 * 6 = 54 (positive).\n     - **Column 3:** 5 * 5 = 25 (positive).\n     - **Column 4:** 1 * 7 = 7 (positive).\n\n8. **Adjustments:**\n   - Adjust column 0 by ensuring an even number of negatives. We already have -4 and 3, so we need another negative. Select -6 at (2,0) to make the product positive: (-4) * 4 * (-6) * 3 * 5 = 1440.\n\n9. **Final Selection:**\n   - The selected positions are: (0,0), (0,3), (0,4), (1,0), (1,3), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,4).\n\n10. **Output:**\n   - The final answer is: <<<0 0, 0 3, 0 4, 1 0, 1 3, 2 0, 2 1, 2 2, 3 0, 3 4>>>."
