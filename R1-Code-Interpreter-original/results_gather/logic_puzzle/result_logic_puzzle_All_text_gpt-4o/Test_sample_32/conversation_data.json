    "To solve this problem, we need to select 6 different numbers from the given 4x4 grid such that the product of the numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 4 in the top-rightmost square (0,3) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's analyze the grid and the constraints step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis:**\n   ```\n   Row 0: -4, 8, 4, 4\n   Row 1: 4, -5, 4, -2\n   Row 2: -1, 6, 2, 8\n   Row 3: 5, -3, 6, 3\n   ```\n\n2. **Initial Selection:**\n   - We start with the number 4 at position (0,3).\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - We need to select 6 numbers in total.\n   - The product of the numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers must be greater than 0.\n\n4. **Strategy:**\n   - Since the product must be greater than 0, we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers.\n   - We need to ensure that the selected numbers are spread across different rows and columns to satisfy the product condition.\n\n5. **Selection Process:**\n   - Start with (0,3) which is 4 (positive).\n   - Select (0,1) which is 8 (positive) to ensure the product in row 0 is positive.\n   - Select (1,0) which is 4 (positive) to ensure the product in column 0 is positive.\n   - Select (1,2) which is 4 (positive) to ensure the product in row 1 is positive.\n   - Select (2,1) which is 6 (positive) to ensure the product in column 1 is positive.\n   - Select (3,2) which is 6 (positive) to ensure the product in column 2 is positive.\n\n6. **Verification:**\n   - Row 0: (0,1) and (0,3) are both positive, product > 0.\n   - Row 1: (1,0) and (1,2) are both positive, product > 0.\n   - Row 2: (2,1) is positive, product > 0.\n   - Row 3: (3,2) is positive, product > 0.\n   - Column 0: (1,0) is positive, product > 0.\n   - Column 1: (0,1) and (2,1) are both positive, product > 0.\n   - Column 2: (1,2) and (3,2) are both positive, product > 0.\n   - Column 3: (0,3) is positive, product > 0.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - The selected numbers satisfy the condition that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 3, 0 1, 1 0, 1 2, 2 1, 3 2>>>"
