    "To solve this problem, we need to select 9 different numbers from the 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 3 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Grid and Constraints:**\n   - We have a 5x5 grid with numbers ranging from -8 to 8.\n   - We need to select 9 numbers such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0.\n   - The number at position (0,4) is already selected.\n\n2. **Initial Selection:**\n   - Start with the number at (0,4), which is 3.\n\n3. **Product Constraint:**\n   - For the product of numbers in a row or column to be greater than 0, the product must be positive.\n   - This means we need an even number of negative numbers or all positive numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers.\n\n4. **Strategy:**\n   - We need to carefully select numbers to ensure that each row and column with selected numbers has a positive product.\n   - We will try to balance the number of negative and positive numbers in each row and column.\n\n5. **Selection Process:**\n   - Start by selecting numbers in the first row. We already have (0,4) selected.\n   - Choose (0,0) = 8 and (0,2) = 5. This gives us a positive product for the first row: 8 * 5 * 3 = 120.\n   - Move to the second row. Choose (1,1) = 5 and (1,3) = 3. This gives us a positive product for the second row: 8 * 5 * 3 = 120.\n   - For the third row, choose (2,0) = 5 and (2,2) = 7. This gives us a positive product for the third row: 5 * 7 * -8 = -280. We need to adjust this later.\n   - For the fourth row, choose (3,4) = 1. This gives us a positive product for the fourth row: -2 * -3 * 1 = 6.\n   - For the fifth row, choose (4,1) = 8. This gives us a positive product for the fifth row: -1 * 8 * 8 = -64. We need to adjust this later.\n\n6. **Adjustments:**\n   - We need to ensure that the product of each column is also positive.\n   - Adjust the third row by selecting (2,4) = -8. Now the product is 5 * 7 * -8 * -8 = 2240, which is positive.\n   - Adjust the fifth row by selecting (4,3) = -4. Now the product is -1 * 8 * -4 = 32, which is positive.\n\n7. **Final Selection:**\n   - After adjustments, we have selected the following positions: (0,0), (0,2), (0,4), (1,1), (1,3), (2,0), (2,2), (3,4), (4,1).\n\n8. **Verification:**\n   - Verify that each row and column with selected numbers has a positive product.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 0, 0 2, 0 4, 1 1, 1 3, 2 0, 2 2, 3 4, 4 1>>>"
