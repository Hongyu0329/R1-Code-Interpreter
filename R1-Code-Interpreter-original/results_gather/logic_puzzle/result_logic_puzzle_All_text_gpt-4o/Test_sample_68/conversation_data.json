    "To solve this problem, we need to select 10 different numbers from the 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 5 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number. Let's analyze the grid and select the numbers step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Selection**: We start with the number at position (0,4), which is 5.\n\n2. **Row and Column Analysis**:\n   - We need to ensure that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive. This means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column or all positive numbers.\n\n3. **Selecting Numbers**:\n   - **Row 0**: We have already selected (0,4). We need to select one more number from this row. Choose (0,0) which is 9 (positive).\n   - **Row 1**: Choose (1,1) which is 4 (positive) and (1,4) which is 5 (positive).\n   - **Row 2**: Choose (2,0) which is 7 (positive) and (2,4) which is 8 (positive).\n   - **Row 3**: Choose (3,0) which is 4 (positive) and (3,4) which is 6 (positive).\n   - **Row 4**: Choose (4,1) which is 6 (positive) and (4,4) which is 3 (positive).\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   - **Row 0**: Selected numbers are 9 and 5. Product = 9 * 5 = 45 (positive).\n   - **Row 1**: Selected numbers are 4 and 5. Product = 4 * 5 = 20 (positive).\n   - **Row 2**: Selected numbers are 7 and 8. Product = 7 * 8 = 56 (positive).\n   - **Row 3**: Selected numbers are 4 and 6. Product = 4 * 6 = 24 (positive).\n   - **Row 4**: Selected numbers are 6 and 3. Product = 6 * 3 = 18 (positive).\n\n   - **Column 0**: Selected numbers are 9, 7, 4. Product = 9 * 7 * 4 = 252 (positive).\n   - **Column 1**: Selected numbers are 4, 6. Product = 4 * 6 = 24 (positive).\n   - **Column 4**: Selected numbers are 5, 5, 8, 6, 3. Product = 5 * 5 * 8 * 6 * 3 = 3600 (positive).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - We have selected 10 numbers, and the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is positive.\n\nThe selected positions are:\n<<<0 0, 0 4, 1 1, 1 4, 2 0, 2 4, 3 0, 3 4, 4 1, 4 4>>>"
