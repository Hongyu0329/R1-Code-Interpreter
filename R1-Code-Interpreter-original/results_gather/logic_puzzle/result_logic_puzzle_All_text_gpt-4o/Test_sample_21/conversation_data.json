    "To solve this problem, we need to select four different numbers from the given 3x3 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 1 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) is the first selected number. Let's analyze the grid and constraints step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis:**\n   ```\n   (0,0) 3, (0,1) 1, (0,2) 1\n   (1,0) 4, (1,1) 1, (1,2) 4\n   (2,0) 4, (2,1) 2, (2,2) 4\n   ```\n\n2. **Initial Selection:**\n   - We start with the number 1 at position (0,2).\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - We need to select four different numbers.\n   - The sum of selected numbers in each row and column must be ≤ 4.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Selection:**\n   - **Row 0:** We have already selected 1 at (0,2). The remaining numbers in this row are 3 at (0,0) and 1 at (0,1). We cannot select 3 because it would make the row sum exceed 4. So, we select 1 at (0,1).\n   - **Row 1:** The numbers are 4 at (1,0), 1 at (1,1), and 4 at (1,2). We cannot select 4 because it would make the row sum exceed 4. So, we select 1 at (1,1).\n   - **Row 2:** The numbers are 4 at (2,0), 2 at (2,1), and 4 at (2,2). We cannot select 4 for the same reason. So, we select 2 at (2,1).\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   - **Row 0:** Selected numbers are 1 (at 0,1) and 1 (at 0,2). Sum = 2.\n   - **Row 1:** Selected number is 1 (at 1,1). Sum = 1.\n   - **Row 2:** Selected number is 2 (at 2,1). Sum = 2.\n   - **Column 0:** No numbers selected. Sum = 0.\n   - **Column 1:** Selected numbers are 1 (at 0,1), 1 (at 1,1), and 2 (at 2,1). Sum = 4.\n   - **Column 2:** Selected number is 1 (at 0,2). Sum = 1.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - We have selected four different numbers: 1 (at 0,2), 1 (at 0,1), 1 (at 1,1), and 2 (at 2,1).\n   - All row and column sums are ≤ 4.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<0 2, 0 1, 1 1, 2 1>>>"
