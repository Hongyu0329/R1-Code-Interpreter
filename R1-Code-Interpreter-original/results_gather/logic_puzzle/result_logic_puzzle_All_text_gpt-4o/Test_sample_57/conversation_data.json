    "To solve this problem, we need to select 9 different numbers from the 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 5 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Grid and Constraints:**\n   - We have a 5x5 grid with numbers ranging from -8 to 8.\n   - We need to select 9 numbers such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0.\n   - The number at position (0,4) is already selected.\n\n2. **Initial Selection:**\n   - Start with the number at (0,4), which is 5.\n\n3. **Product Constraint:**\n   - For the product of numbers in a row or column to be greater than 0, the number of negative numbers in that row or column must be even, or all numbers must be positive.\n\n4. **Strategy:**\n   - We need to carefully select numbers to ensure that each row and column with selected numbers has an even number of negative numbers or all positive numbers.\n   - We will try to balance the selection of positive and negative numbers.\n\n5. **Selection Process:**\n   - Start with the given number at (0,4).\n   - Select numbers from each row and column, ensuring the product constraint is satisfied.\n\n6. **Step-by-Step Selection:**\n   - Row 0: Already have (0,4). Select (0,0) and (0,1) to ensure positive product. Numbers: 8, 3, 5.\n   - Row 1: Select (1,2) and (1,4). Numbers: 7, 3.\n   - Row 2: Select (2,0) and (2,3). Numbers: 3, 8.\n   - Row 3: Select (3,1). Number: 5.\n   - Row 4: Select (4,3). Number: 5.\n\n7. **Verification:**\n   - Check each row and column to ensure the product of selected numbers is positive.\n   - Row 0: 8, 3, 5 (positive product).\n   - Row 1: 7, 3 (positive product).\n   - Row 2: 3, 8 (positive product).\n   - Row 3: 5 (positive product).\n   - Row 4: 5 (positive product).\n   - Column 0: 8, 3 (positive product).\n   - Column 1: 3, 5 (positive product).\n   - Column 2: 7 (positive product).\n   - Column 3: 8, 5 (positive product).\n   - Column 4: 5, 3 (positive product).\n\n8. **Final Selection:**\n   - The selected positions are: (0,0), (0,1), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,0), (2,3), (3,1), (4,3).\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 0, 0 1, 0 4, 1 2, 1 4, 2 0, 2 3, 3 1, 4 3>>>"
