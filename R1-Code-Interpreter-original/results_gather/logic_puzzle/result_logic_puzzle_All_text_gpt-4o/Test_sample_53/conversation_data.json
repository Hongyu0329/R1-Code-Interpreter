    "To solve this problem, we need to select 9 different numbers from the 5x5 grid such that the product of the numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 3 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number. Let's analyze the grid and the constraints step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis:**\n   ```\n   3,  4, -7,  7,  3\n  -5, -2,  2, -1,  1\n  -6,  4,  1, -4,  7\n   7,  6,  1,  3, -6\n   6, -3,  3, -3,  8\n   ```\n\n2. **Initial Selection:**\n   - We start with the number 3 at position (0,4).\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - We need to select 9 numbers.\n   - The product of numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers must be greater than 0.\n   - This implies that each row and column must have an even number of negative numbers or no negative numbers at all.\n\n4. **Strategy:**\n   - We need to ensure that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive.\n   - We will try to balance the number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n\n5. **Selection Process:**\n   - Start with the given number at (0,4).\n   - Select numbers such that each row and column has an even number of negative numbers or no negative numbers.\n\n6. **Step-by-Step Selection:**\n   - Row 0: Select (0,0) = 3, (0,1) = 4, (0,4) = 3 (already selected).\n   - Row 1: Select (1,2) = 2, (1,4) = 1.\n   - Row 2: Select (2,1) = 4, (2,4) = 7.\n   - Row 3: Select (3,0) = 7, (3,3) = 3.\n   - Row 4: Select (4,4) = 8.\n\n7. **Verification:**\n   - Check each row and column to ensure the product is positive:\n     - Row 0: 3 * 4 * 3 = 36 (positive)\n     - Row 1: 2 * 1 = 2 (positive)\n     - Row 2: 4 * 7 = 28 (positive)\n     - Row 3: 7 * 3 = 21 (positive)\n     - Row 4: 8 (positive)\n     - Column 0: 3 * 7 = 21 (positive)\n     - Column 1: 4 * 4 = 16 (positive)\n     - Column 2: 2 (positive)\n     - Column 3: 3 (positive)\n     - Column 4: 3 * 1 * 7 * 8 = 168 (positive)\n\n8. **Final Selection:**\n   - The selected positions are: (0,0), (0,1), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,1), (2,4), (3,0), (3,3), (4,4).\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 0, 0 1, 0 4, 1 2, 1 4, 2 1, 2 4, 3 0, 3 3, 4 4>>>"
