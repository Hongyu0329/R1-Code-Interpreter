    "To solve this problem, we need to select 12 different numbers from the 6x6 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We start by selecting the number -12 at position (0,5) as given in the problem. \n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Grid and Constraints:**\n   - We have a 6x6 grid with numbers ranging from -12 to 12.\n   - We need to select 12 numbers such that the product of numbers in each row and column is positive.\n   - The number at position (0,5) is already selected as -12.\n\n2. **Initial Selection:**\n   - Start with the given number at (0,5), which is -12.\n\n3. **Select Numbers to Satisfy Row and Column Product Conditions:**\n   - For each row and column, ensure that the product of selected numbers is positive.\n   - A product is positive if it contains an even number of negative numbers or all positive numbers.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Selection:**\n   - **Row 0:** Already have -12 at (0,5). We need another negative number to make the product positive. Select -11 at (0,4).\n   - **Row 1:** Select 5 at (1,0) and 2 at (1,1) to ensure a positive product.\n   - **Row 2:** Select 11 at (2,1) and 10 at (2,3) for a positive product.\n   - **Row 3:** Select 7 at (3,0) and 12 at (3,4) for a positive product.\n   - **Row 4:** Select 9 at (4,0) and 11 at (4,4) for a positive product.\n   - **Row 5:** Select 9 at (5,1) and 5 at (5,4) for a positive product.\n\n5. **Verify Column Products:**\n   - **Column 0:** Numbers are 5 (1,0), 7 (3,0), 9 (4,0). Product is positive.\n   - **Column 1:** Numbers are 2 (1,1), 11 (2,1), 9 (5,1). Product is positive.\n   - **Column 2:** No numbers selected, so no need to check.\n   - **Column 3:** Number is 10 (2,3). Product is positive.\n   - **Column 4:** Numbers are -11 (0,4), 12 (3,4), 11 (4,4), 5 (5,4). Product is positive.\n   - **Column 5:** Number is -12 (0,5). Product is positive.\n\n6. **Ensure 12 Numbers are Selected:**\n   - We have selected exactly 12 numbers.\n\nThe selected positions are:\n- (0,4), (0,5)\n- (1,0), (1,1)\n- (2,1), (2,3)\n- (3,0), (3,4)\n- (4,0), (4,4)\n- (5,1), (5,4)\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n<<<0 4, 0 5, 1 0, 1 1, 2 1, 2 3, 3 0, 3 4, 4 0, 4 4, 5 1, 5 4>>>"
