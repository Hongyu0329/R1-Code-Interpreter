    "To solve this problem, we need to select 9 different numbers from the 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 5 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Grid and Constraints:**\n   - We have a 5x5 grid with numbers ranging from -8 to 8.\n   - We need to select 9 numbers such that the product of numbers in each row and column is greater than 0.\n   - The number 5 at position (0,4) is already selected.\n\n2. **Product Greater than 0:**\n   - For the product of numbers in a row or column to be greater than 0, the number of negative numbers must be even, or all numbers must be positive.\n\n3. **Initial Selection:**\n   - Start with the given number 5 at position (0,4).\n\n4. **Select Numbers to Satisfy Row and Column Conditions:**\n   - We need to ensure that each row and column with selected numbers has a positive product.\n   - We will select numbers such that the number of negative numbers in each row and column is even.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Selection:**\n   - **Row 0:** We have already selected (0,4). We need to select two more numbers from this row. Choose (0,0) = -7 and (0,3) = 6. The product is -7 * 6 * 5 = -210, which is negative. We need to adjust our selection.\n   - Instead, choose (0,1) = 1 and (0,2) = 1. The product is 1 * 1 * 5 = 5, which is positive.\n   - **Row 1:** Choose (1,0) = 7 and (1,3) = 8. The product is 7 * 8 = 56, which is positive.\n   - **Row 2:** Choose (2,0) = 7 and (2,4) = 1. The product is 7 * 1 = 7, which is positive.\n   - **Row 3:** Choose (3,0) = 7 and (3,4) = 2. The product is 7 * 2 = 14, which is positive.\n   - **Row 4:** Choose (4,0) = 3 and (4,4) = 7. The product is 3 * 7 = 21, which is positive.\n\n6. **Verify Column Conditions:**\n   - **Column 0:** We have selected (0,0) = -7, (1,0) = 7, (2,0) = 7, (3,0) = 7, (4,0) = 3. The product is -7 * 7 * 7 * 7 * 3, which is negative. We need to adjust.\n   - Instead, select (0,1) = 1, (1,0) = 7, (2,0) = 7, (3,0) = 7, (4,0) = 3. The product is 1 * 7 * 7 * 7 * 3, which is positive.\n   - **Column 1:** We have selected (0,1) = 1, (1,1) = 1. The product is 1 * 1 = 1, which is positive.\n   - **Column 2:** We have selected (0,2) = 1. The product is 1, which is positive.\n   - **Column 3:** We have selected (1,3) = 8. The product is 8, which is positive.\n   - **Column 4:** We have selected (0,4) = 5, (2,4) = 1, (3,4) = 2, (4,4) = 7. The product is 5 * 1 * 2 * 7 = 70, which is positive.\n\n7. **Final Selection:**\n   - The selected positions are: (0,1), (0,2), (0,4), (1,0), (1,3), (2,0), (2,4), (3,0), (4,0).\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 1, 0 2, 0 4, 1 0, 1 3, 2 0, 2 4, 3 0, 4 0>>>"
