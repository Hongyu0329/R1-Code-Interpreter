    "To solve this problem, we need to select four different numbers from the given 3x3 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 4 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) is already selected. Let's analyze the grid and the constraints step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis:**\n   ```\n   1, 4, 4\n   2, 1, 4\n   2, 3, 3\n   ```\n\n2. **Initial Selection:**\n   - We start by selecting the number 4 at position (0,2).\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - We need to select three more numbers such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4.\n   - We must select four different numbers in total.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Selection:**\n   - **Row 0:** We have already selected 4 at (0,2). The remaining numbers in this row are 1 at (0,0) and 4 at (0,1). We cannot select another 4, so we consider selecting 1 at (0,0).\n   - **Row 1:** The numbers are 2 at (1,0), 1 at (1,1), and 4 at (1,2). We can select 1 at (1,1) to keep the sum low.\n   - **Row 2:** The numbers are 2 at (2,0), 3 at (2,1), and 3 at (2,2). We can select 2 at (2,0) to keep the sum low.\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   - **Row 0:** Selected numbers are 1 (at 0,0) and 4 (at 0,2). Sum = 1 + 4 = 5. This exceeds 4, so we need to adjust.\n   - **Row 1:** Selected number is 1 (at 1,1). Sum = 1. This is valid.\n   - **Row 2:** Selected number is 2 (at 2,0). Sum = 2. This is valid.\n   - **Column 0:** Selected numbers are 1 (at 0,0) and 2 (at 2,0). Sum = 1 + 2 = 3. This is valid.\n   - **Column 1:** Selected number is 1 (at 1,1). Sum = 1. This is valid.\n   - **Column 2:** Selected number is 4 (at 0,2). Sum = 4. This is valid.\n\n6. **Adjustment:**\n   - Since the sum in Row 0 exceeds 4, we need to adjust our selection. Let's try selecting 1 at (1,1) and 2 at (2,0) without selecting 1 at (0,0).\n\n7. **Final Selection:**\n   - Select 4 at (0,2), 1 at (1,1), and 2 at (2,0).\n\n8. **Verification of Final Selection:**\n   - **Row 0:** Selected number is 4 (at 0,2). Sum = 4. This is valid.\n   - **Row 1:** Selected number is 1 (at 1,1). Sum = 1. This is valid.\n   - **Row 2:** Selected number is 2 (at 2,0). Sum = 2. This is valid.\n   - **Column 0:** Selected number is 2 (at 2,0). Sum = 2. This is valid.\n   - **Column 1:** Selected number is 1 (at 1,1). Sum = 1. This is valid.\n   - **Column 2:** Selected number is 4 (at 0,2). Sum = 4. This is valid.\n\nThe final selection satisfies all the constraints.\n\n**Answer:**\n<<<0 2, 1 1, 2 0>>>"
