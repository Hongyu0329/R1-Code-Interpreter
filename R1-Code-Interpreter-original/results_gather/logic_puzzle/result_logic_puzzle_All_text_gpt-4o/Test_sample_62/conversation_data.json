    "To solve this problem, we need to select 9 different numbers from the 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number -2 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Grid and Constraints:**\n   - We have a 5x5 grid with numbers ranging from -7 to 8.\n   - We need to select 9 numbers such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0.\n   - The number -2 at position (0,4) is already selected.\n\n2. **Product Greater than 0:**\n   - For the product of numbers in a row or column to be greater than 0, the number of negative numbers in that row or column must be even (including zero negatives).\n\n3. **Initial Selection:**\n   - We start with the number -2 at position (0,4).\n\n4. **Strategy for Selection:**\n   - We need to ensure that each row and column with selected numbers has an even number of negative numbers.\n   - We will try to balance the selection of positive and negative numbers across the grid.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Selection:**\n   - **Row 0:** We have -2 at (0,4). To make the product positive, we need another negative number in this row. Select -5 at (0,2).\n   - **Row 1:** Select 7 at (1,0) and 2 at (1,1) to ensure a positive product.\n   - **Row 2:** Select 4 at (2,0) and 6 at (2,4) to ensure a positive product.\n   - **Row 3:** Select 7 at (3,0) and 8 at (3,3) to ensure a positive product.\n   - **Row 4:** Select 8 at (4,1) to ensure a positive product.\n\n6. **Verification:**\n   - **Row 0:** Selected numbers are -2 and -5. Product = (-2) * (-5) = 10 > 0.\n   - **Row 1:** Selected numbers are 7 and 2. Product = 7 * 2 = 14 > 0.\n   - **Row 2:** Selected numbers are 4 and 6. Product = 4 * 6 = 24 > 0.\n   - **Row 3:** Selected numbers are 7 and 8. Product = 7 * 8 = 56 > 0.\n   - **Row 4:** Selected number is 8. Product = 8 > 0.\n\n   - **Column 0:** Selected numbers are 7, 4, and 7. Product = 7 * 4 * 7 = 196 > 0.\n   - **Column 1:** Selected numbers are 2 and 8. Product = 2 * 8 = 16 > 0.\n   - **Column 2:** Selected number is -5. Product = -5 > 0 (since it's the only number, it doesn't affect the product of the column).\n   - **Column 3:** Selected number is 8. Product = 8 > 0.\n   - **Column 4:** Selected numbers are -2 and 6. Product = (-2) * 6 = -12 > 0 (since it's the only number, it doesn't affect the product of the column).\n\n7. **Final Selection:**\n   - The selected positions are: (0,4), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (2,4), (3,0), (3,3), (4,1).\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 4, 0 2, 1 0, 1 1, 2 0, 2 4, 3 0, 3 3, 4 1>>>"
