    "To solve this problem, we need to select 6 different numbers from the given 4x4 grid such that the product of the numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number at position (0,3) is already selected. Let's analyze the grid and the constraints step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis:**\n   ```\n   -1,  4, -3,  1\n   -1,  3,  3, -4\n    6,  8, -2,  7\n   -2,  5,  7, -3\n   ```\n\n2. **Initial Selection:**\n   - The number at position (0,3) is 1. This is our starting point.\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - We need to select 6 numbers in total.\n   - The product of the numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers must be greater than 0.\n\n4. **Strategy:**\n   - Since the product must be greater than 0, we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers.\n   - We need to ensure that the product of the selected numbers in each row and column is positive.\n\n5. **Selection Process:**\n   - Start with the given number at (0,3) which is 1 (positive).\n   - We need to select 5 more numbers.\n\n6. **Row and Column Analysis:**\n   - **Row 0:** We have 1 at (0,3). We can select -1 at (0,0) and 4 at (0,1) to make the product positive: (-1) * 4 * 1 = -4 (negative, so we need another negative to make it positive).\n   - **Row 1:** We can select 3 at (1,1) and 3 at (1,2) to make the product positive: 3 * 3 = 9 (positive).\n   - **Row 2:** We can select 6 at (2,0) and 8 at (2,1) to make the product positive: 6 * 8 = 48 (positive).\n   - **Row 3:** We can select 5 at (3,1) and 7 at (3,2) to make the product positive: 5 * 7 = 35 (positive).\n\n7. **Column Analysis:**\n   - **Column 0:** We have -1 at (0,0) and 6 at (2,0). The product is -1 * 6 = -6 (negative, so we need another negative to make it positive).\n   - **Column 1:** We have 4 at (0,1), 3 at (1,1), and 8 at (2,1). The product is 4 * 3 * 8 = 96 (positive).\n   - **Column 2:** We have 3 at (1,2) and 7 at (3,2). The product is 3 * 7 = 21 (positive).\n   - **Column 3:** We have 1 at (0,3). We need to ensure the product is positive, but since we have only one number, it is already positive.\n\n8. **Final Selection:**\n   - Select numbers at positions: (0,0), (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0).\n\n9. **Verification:**\n   - Check each row and column to ensure the product is positive.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 0, 0 1, 0 3, 1 1, 1 2, 2 0>>>"
