    "To solve this problem, we need to select 10 different numbers from the 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 4 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number. Let's analyze the grid and select the numbers step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Selection**: We start with the number 4 at position (0,4).\n\n2. **Row and Column Analysis**:\n   - We need to ensure that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive. This means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column or all positive numbers.\n\n3. **Selecting Numbers**:\n   - **Row 0**: We have already selected 4 at (0,4). We need to select one more number from this row. Choose 9 at (0,3) to keep the product positive.\n   - **Row 1**: Choose 6 at (1,2) and 5 at (1,3). Both are positive, ensuring a positive product.\n   - **Row 2**: Choose 8 at (2,1) and 5 at (2,2). Both are positive, ensuring a positive product.\n   - **Row 3**: Choose 10 at (3,0) and 9 at (3,4). Both are positive, ensuring a positive product.\n   - **Row 4**: Choose 5 at (4,0) and 3 at (4,1). Both are positive, ensuring a positive product.\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   - **Column 0**: Selected numbers are 10 (3,0) and 5 (4,0). Product is positive.\n   - **Column 1**: Selected numbers are 8 (2,1) and 3 (4,1). Product is positive.\n   - **Column 2**: Selected number is 6 (1,2). Product is positive.\n   - **Column 3**: Selected numbers are 9 (0,3) and 5 (1,3). Product is positive.\n   - **Column 4**: Selected numbers are 4 (0,4) and 9 (3,4). Product is positive.\n\n5. **Final Selection**:\n   - The selected positions are: (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,4), (4,0), (4,1).\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 3, 0 4, 1 2, 1 3, 2 1, 2 2, 3 0, 3 4, 4 0, 4 1>>>"
