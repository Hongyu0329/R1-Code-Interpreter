    "To solve this problem, we need to select 9 different numbers from the 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number -6 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Grid and Constraints:**\n   - We have a 5x5 grid with numbers ranging from -8 to 8.\n   - We need to select 9 numbers such that the product of numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0.\n   - The number -6 at position (0,4) is already selected.\n\n2. **Product Greater than 0:**\n   - For the product of numbers in a row or column to be greater than 0, the number of negative numbers must be even, or all numbers must be positive.\n\n3. **Initial Selection:**\n   - Start with the given number -6 at position (0,4).\n\n4. **Select Numbers:**\n   - We need to select 8 more numbers while ensuring the product condition is satisfied for each row and column.\n\n5. **Strategy:**\n   - Since -6 is negative, we need to select an even number of negative numbers in the row and column containing (0,4).\n   - We can select numbers from different rows and columns to balance the negatives and positives.\n\n6. **Selection Process:**\n   - Select numbers from the grid ensuring that each row and column with selected numbers has an even number of negative numbers or all positive numbers.\n\n7. **Example Selection:**\n   - Row 0: Select (0,4) which is -6.\n   - Row 1: Select (1,2) which is 7, and (1,4) which is 8.\n   - Row 2: Select (2,0) which is 4, and (2,2) which is 6.\n   - Row 3: Select (3,0) which is 8, and (3,3) which is 8.\n   - Row 4: Select (4,2) which is 4, and (4,4) which is 3.\n\n8. **Verify Product Condition:**\n   - Check each row and column to ensure the product of selected numbers is greater than 0.\n\n9. **Final Selection:**\n   - After verifying, the selected positions are: (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,0), (2,2), (3,0), (3,3), (4,2), (4,4).\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 4, 1 2, 1 4, 2 0, 2 2, 3 0, 3 3, 4 2, 4 4>>>"
