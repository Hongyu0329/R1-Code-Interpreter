    "To solve this problem, we need to select 10 different numbers from the 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We start with the number -1 at position (0,4) as the first selected number. Let's analyze the grid and select the numbers step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Selection**: We start with the number -1 at position (0,4).\n\n2. **Row and Column Analysis**:\n   - We need to ensure that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive. This means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column or all positive numbers.\n\n3. **Selecting Numbers**:\n   - **Row 0**: We have already selected -1 at (0,4). To make the product positive, we need another negative number in this row. We can select -3 at (0,2).\n   - **Row 1**: We can select 5 at (1,0) and 6 at (1,1) to ensure a positive product.\n   - **Row 2**: We can select 9 at (2,0) and 10 at (2,3) to ensure a positive product.\n   - **Row 3**: We can select 10 at (3,0) and 4 at (3,2) to ensure a positive product.\n   - **Row 4**: We can select 6 at (4,1) and 10 at (4,3) to ensure a positive product.\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   - **Column 0**: Selected numbers are 5 (1,0), 9 (2,0), and 10 (3,0). Product is positive.\n   - **Column 1**: Selected numbers are 6 (1,1) and 6 (4,1). Product is positive.\n   - **Column 2**: Selected numbers are -3 (0,2) and 4 (3,2). Product is negative, so we need to adjust.\n   - **Column 3**: Selected numbers are 10 (2,3) and 10 (4,3). Product is positive.\n   - **Column 4**: Selected number is -1 (0,4). We need to ensure an even number of negatives in this column.\n\n5. **Adjustments**:\n   - To fix column 2, we can select -2 at (4,2) to make the product positive.\n   - For column 4, we need another negative number. We can select -5 at (2,4).\n\n6. **Final Selection**:\n   - The selected numbers are at positions: (0,4), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (2,3), (3,0), (3,2), (4,1), and (4,2).\n\n7. **Verification of Final Selection**:\n   - **Row 0**: -1 and -3, product is positive.\n   - **Row 1**: 5 and 6, product is positive.\n   - **Row 2**: 9, 10, and -5, product is positive.\n   - **Row 3**: 10 and 4, product is positive.\n   - **Row 4**: 6, -2, and 10, product is positive.\n   - **Column 0**: 5, 9, and 10, product is positive.\n   - **Column 1**: 6 and 6, product is positive.\n   - **Column 2**: -3 and 4, product is positive with -2.\n   - **Column 3**: 10 and 10, product is positive.\n   - **Column 4**: -1 and -5, product is positive.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 4, 0 2, 1 0, 1 1, 2 0, 2 3, 3 0, 3 2, 4 1, 4 2>>>"
