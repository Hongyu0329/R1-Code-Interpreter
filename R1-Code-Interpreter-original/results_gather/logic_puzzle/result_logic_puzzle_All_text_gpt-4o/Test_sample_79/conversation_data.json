    "To solve this problem, we need to select 10 different numbers from the 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number -9 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number. Let's analyze the grid and select the numbers step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Selection**: We start with the number -9 at position (0,4).\n\n2. **Row and Column Analysis**:\n   - For each row and column, we need to ensure that the product of the selected numbers is positive. This means we need an even number of negative numbers or all positive numbers in each row and column.\n\n3. **Selecting Numbers**:\n   - **Row 0**: We have -9 at (0,4). To make the product positive, we need another negative number in this row. Select -3 at (0,2).\n   - **Row 1**: Select -8 at (1,1) and -3 at (1,4) to ensure the product is positive.\n   - **Row 2**: Select 6 at (2,1) and 10 at (2,4) to ensure the product is positive.\n   - **Row 3**: Select -2 at (3,0) and 6 at (3,2) to ensure the product is positive.\n   - **Row 4**: Select -10 at (4,1) and 6 at (4,3) to ensure the product is positive.\n\n4. **Column Analysis**:\n   - **Column 0**: We have -2 at (3,0). To make the product positive, we need another negative number. Select -1 at (0,0).\n   - **Column 1**: We have -8 at (1,1), 6 at (2,1), and -10 at (4,1). The product is positive.\n   - **Column 2**: We have -3 at (0,2) and 6 at (3,2). The product is positive.\n   - **Column 3**: We have 6 at (4,3). To make the product positive, select 8 at (0,3).\n   - **Column 4**: We have -9 at (0,4), -3 at (1,4), and 10 at (2,4). The product is positive.\n\n5. **Final Selection**:\n   - The selected numbers are at positions: (0,0), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,1), (1,4), (2,1), (2,4), (3,0), (4,1).\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 0, 0 2, 0 3, 0 4, 1 1, 1 4, 2 1, 2 4, 3 0, 4 1>>>"
