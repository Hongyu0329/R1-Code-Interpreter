    "To solve this problem, we need to select three different numbers from a 2x2 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 1 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) is already selected. Let's analyze the grid and the constraints step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Representation:**\n   - The grid is given as:\n     ```\n     3, 1\n     3, 2\n     ```\n   - In terms of coordinates, the grid is:\n     ```\n     (0,0) -> 3, (0,1) -> 1\n     (1,0) -> 3, (1,1) -> 2\n     ```\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - We need to select three different numbers.\n   - The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column should be less than or equal to 4.\n   - The number 1 at position (0,1) is already selected.\n\n3. **Selection Process:**\n   - Since (0,1) is already selected, we have:\n     - Row 0: 1\n     - Column 1: 1\n\n4. **Possible Selections:**\n   - We need to select two more numbers from the remaining cells: (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1).\n   - The numbers in these cells are 3, 3, and 2, respectively.\n\n5. **Checking Combinations:**\n   - We need to ensure that the sum in each row and column is ≤ 4.\n   - Let's try selecting (0,0) and (1,1):\n     - Selected numbers: 1 (at 0,1), 3 (at 0,0), 2 (at 1,1)\n     - Row 0 sum: 3 + 1 = 4\n     - Row 1 sum: 2\n     - Column 0 sum: 3\n     - Column 1 sum: 1 + 2 = 3\n   - All sums are ≤ 4, so this selection is valid.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The valid selection of positions is (0,1), (0,0), and (1,1).\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<0 1, 0 0, 1 1>>>"
