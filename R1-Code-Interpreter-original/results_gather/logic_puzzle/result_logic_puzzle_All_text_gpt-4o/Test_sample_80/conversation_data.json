    "To solve this problem, we need to select 12 different numbers from the 6x6 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We start with the number 1 at position (0,5) as the first selected number. Let's analyze the grid and select the numbers step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Selection**: We start with the number 1 at position (0,5).\n\n2. **Row and Column Analysis**:\n   - We need to ensure that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is greater than 0. This means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column or all positive numbers.\n\n3. **Selection Strategy**:\n   - We will try to select numbers such that each row and column has an even number of negative numbers or all positive numbers.\n   - We will also ensure that we select exactly 12 numbers.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Selection**:\n   - **Row 0**: We have already selected (0,5). We need to select one more number from this row. Choose (0,0) which is 1 (positive).\n   - **Row 1**: Select (1,1) which is 3 (positive) and (1,5) which is 6 (positive).\n   - **Row 2**: Select (2,0) which is 2 (positive) and (2,5) which is 11 (positive).\n   - **Row 3**: Select (3,0) which is 10 (positive) and (3,5) which is 12 (positive).\n   - **Row 4**: Select (4,0) which is 2 (positive) and (4,5) which is 7 (positive).\n   - **Row 5**: Select (5,0) which is 1 (positive) and (5,5) which is 1 (positive).\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - **Row 0**: Selected numbers are 1, 1. Product = 1 (positive).\n   - **Row 1**: Selected numbers are 3, 6. Product = 18 (positive).\n   - **Row 2**: Selected numbers are 2, 11. Product = 22 (positive).\n   - **Row 3**: Selected numbers are 10, 12. Product = 120 (positive).\n   - **Row 4**: Selected numbers are 2, 7. Product = 14 (positive).\n   - **Row 5**: Selected numbers are 1, 1. Product = 1 (positive).\n   - **Column 0**: Selected numbers are 1, 3, 2, 10, 2, 1. Product = 120 (positive).\n   - **Column 5**: Selected numbers are 1, 6, 11, 12, 7, 1. Product = 5544 (positive).\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - We have selected 12 numbers, and the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0.\n\nThe selected positions are:\n<<<0 0, 0 5, 1 1, 1 5, 2 0, 2 5, 3 0, 3 5, 4 0, 4 5, 5 0, 5 5>>>"
