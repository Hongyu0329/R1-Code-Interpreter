    "To solve this problem, we need to select 9 different numbers from the 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 7 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Grid and Constraints:**\n   - The grid is 5x5, and each cell contains a number between -8 and 8.\n   - We need to select 9 numbers such that the product of numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0.\n   - The number 7 at position (0,4) is already selected.\n\n2. **Product Greater than 0:**\n   - For the product of numbers in a row or column to be greater than 0, the number of negative numbers must be even, or all numbers must be positive.\n\n3. **Initial Selection:**\n   - Start with the given number 7 at position (0,4).\n\n4. **Strategy for Selection:**\n   - We need to ensure that each row and column with selected numbers has a positive product.\n   - We should aim to balance the number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n\n5. **Select Numbers:**\n   - We will select numbers from each row and column, ensuring the product condition is met.\n\n6. **Step-by-Step Selection:**\n   - **Row 0:** Already have 7 at (0,4). Select 3 at (0,0) and 1 at (0,1) to ensure positive product.\n   - **Row 1:** Select 7 at (1,0) and 6 at (1,4) to ensure positive product.\n   - **Row 2:** Select 1 at (2,0) and 3 at (2,1) to ensure positive product.\n   - **Row 3:** Select 6 at (3,0) and 5 at (3,4) to ensure positive product.\n   - **Row 4:** Select 1 at (4,0) to ensure positive product.\n\n7. **Verify Column Products:**\n   - **Column 0:** 3 (0,0), 7 (1,0), 1 (2,0), 6 (3,0), 1 (4,0) -> Product is positive.\n   - **Column 1:** 1 (0,1), 3 (2,1) -> Product is positive.\n   - **Column 4:** 7 (0,4), 6 (1,4), 5 (3,4) -> Product is positive.\n\n8. **Final Selection:**\n   - Ensure that we have selected exactly 9 numbers.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the selected positions are:\n<<<0 0, 0 1, 0 4, 1 0, 1 4, 2 0, 2 1, 3 0, 3 4>>>"
