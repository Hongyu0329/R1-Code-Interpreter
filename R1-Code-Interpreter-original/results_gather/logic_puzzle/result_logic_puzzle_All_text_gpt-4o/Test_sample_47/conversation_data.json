    "To solve this problem, we need to select 6 different numbers from the 4x4 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 7 in the top-rightmost square (0,3) is the first selected number. Let's analyze the grid and select the numbers step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis:**\n   ```\n   -3, 8, 8, 7\n   2, -3, 5, 3\n   5, 4, 6, 5\n   6, -5, 5, 1\n   ```\n\n2. **Initial Selection:**\n   - We start with the number 7 at position (0,3).\n\n3. **Selecting Additional Numbers:**\n   - We need to select numbers such that the product of each row and column containing the selected numbers is positive.\n   - Since we have already selected 7 at (0,3), we need to ensure that the product of numbers in row 0 and column 3 is positive.\n\n4. **Row 0 Selection:**\n   - We have 7 at (0,3). To ensure a positive product in row 0, we can select 8 at (0,1) and 8 at (0,2). This gives us a product of 8 * 8 * 7 = 448, which is positive.\n\n5. **Column 3 Selection:**\n   - We have 7 at (0,3). To ensure a positive product in column 3, we can select 3 at (1,3) and 5 at (2,3). This gives us a product of 7 * 3 * 5 = 105, which is positive.\n\n6. **Selecting the 6th Number:**\n   - We have selected 5 numbers so far: (0,3), (0,1), (0,2), (1,3), and (2,3).\n   - We need to select one more number such that the product of numbers in its row and column is positive.\n   - We can select 5 at (2,0). This ensures a positive product in row 2 (5 * 4 * 6 * 5 = 600) and column 0 (5 * 2 * 5 * 6 = 300).\n\n7. **Final Selection:**\n   - The selected positions are (0,3), (0,1), (0,2), (1,3), (2,3), and (2,0).\n\nThe final answer is: <<<0 3, 0 1, 0 2, 1 3, 2 3, 2 0>>>"
