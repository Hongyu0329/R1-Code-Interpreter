    "To solve this problem, we need to select three different numbers from a 2x2 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 1 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) is already selected. Let's analyze the grid and the constraints step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Representation:**\n   - The grid is:\n     ```\n     2, 1\n     1, 3\n     ```\n   - In terms of coordinates (0-based index):\n     ```\n     (0,0) = 2, (0,1) = 1\n     (1,0) = 1, (1,1) = 3\n     ```\n\n2. **Selected Number:**\n   - We are given that the number 1 at position (0,1) is already selected.\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - We need to select two more numbers such that:\n     - The sum of the selected numbers in each row is ≤ 4.\n     - The sum of the selected numbers in each column is ≤ 4.\n\n4. **Selection Process:**\n   - We have already selected the number at (0,1), which is 1.\n   - We need to select two more numbers from the remaining three positions: (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1).\n\n5. **Checking Possible Combinations:**\n   - Let's consider selecting the number at (0,0) which is 2:\n     - Row 0: Selected numbers are 2 (at 0,0) and 1 (at 0,1). Sum = 2 + 1 = 3 (≤ 4).\n     - Now, we need to select one more number from row 1.\n     - If we select the number at (1,0) which is 1:\n       - Row 1: Selected number is 1 (at 1,0). Sum = 1 (≤ 4).\n       - Column 0: Selected numbers are 2 (at 0,0) and 1 (at 1,0). Sum = 2 + 1 = 3 (≤ 4).\n       - Column 1: Selected number is 1 (at 0,1). Sum = 1 (≤ 4).\n     - This selection satisfies all constraints.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The selected numbers are at positions (0,1), (0,0), and (1,0).\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<0 1, 0 0, 1 0>>>"
