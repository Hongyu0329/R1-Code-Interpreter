    "To solve this problem, we need to select 10 different numbers from the 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number. Let's analyze the grid and select the numbers step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Selection**: We start with the number 2 at position (0,4).\n\n2. **Row and Column Analysis**:\n   - We need to ensure that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive. This means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column or all positive numbers.\n\n3. **Grid Layout**:\n   ```\n   -8, 10, -8, -3, 2\n    4, 10,  5,  2, 9\n   -5, -4,  5,  9, -2\n    1,  1,  5, -4, -9\n   -9, -5,  1, 10, 3\n   ```\n\n4. **Selection Strategy**:\n   - We need to select numbers such that each row and column has a positive product.\n   - We already have (0,4) selected. We need to select 9 more numbers.\n\n5. **Row 0**: \n   - We have selected (0,4) = 2.\n   - To make the product positive, we can select two more numbers from this row. Let's choose (0,1) = 10 and (0,3) = -3. The product is 2 * 10 * -3 = -60, which is negative. So, we need to adjust our selection.\n\n6. **Adjust Row 0**:\n   - Select (0,0) = -8 and (0,2) = -8. Now, the product is 2 * -8 * -8 = 128, which is positive.\n\n7. **Row 1**:\n   - Select (1,0) = 4 and (1,1) = 10. The product is 4 * 10 = 40, which is positive.\n\n8. **Row 2**:\n   - Select (2,2) = 5 and (2,3) = 9. The product is 5 * 9 = 45, which is positive.\n\n9. **Row 3**:\n   - Select (3,0) = 1 and (3,1) = 1. The product is 1 * 1 = 1, which is positive.\n\n10. **Row 4**:\n    - Select (4,3) = 10. The product is 10, which is positive.\n\n11. **Column Check**:\n    - Column 0: (-8, 4, 1) = -32, which is negative. Adjust by selecting (4,0) = -9. Now, the product is -8 * 4 * 1 * -9 = 288, which is positive.\n    - Column 1: (10, 10, 1) = 100, which is positive.\n    - Column 2: (-8, 5) = -40, which is negative. Adjust by selecting (4,2) = 1. Now, the product is -8 * 5 * 1 = -40, which is negative. Adjust by selecting (3,2) = 5. Now, the product is -8 * 5 * 5 = -200, which is negative. Adjust by selecting (2,1) = -4. Now, the product is -8 * -4 * 5 * 5 = 800, which is positive.\n    - Column 3: (-3, 9, 10) = -270, which is negative. Adjust by selecting (4,3) = 10. Now, the product is -3 * 9 * 10 * 10 = -2700, which is negative. Adjust by selecting (3,3) = -4. Now, the product is -3 * 9 * 10 * 10 * -4 = 10800, which is positive.\n    - Column 4: (2, 9, -2, -9, 3) = 972, which is positive.\n\n12. **Final Selection**:\n    - After ensuring all row and column products are positive, the selected positions are:\n      - (0,0), (0,2), (0,4)\n      - (1,0), (1,1)\n      - (2,1), (2,2)\n      - (3,0), (3,3)\n      - (4,3)\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 0, 0 2, 0 4, 1 0, 1 1, 2 1, 2 2, 3 0, 3 3, 4 3>>>"
