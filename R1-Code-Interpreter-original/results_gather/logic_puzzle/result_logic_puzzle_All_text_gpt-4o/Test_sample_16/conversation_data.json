    "To solve this problem, we need to select four different numbers from the given 3x3 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 1 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) is the first selected number. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Representation:**\n   - The grid is:\n     ```\n     3, 3, 1\n     4, 3, 2\n     4, 4, 3\n     ```\n   - The coordinates for each cell are:\n     ```\n     (0,0), (0,1), (0,2)\n     (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)\n     (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n     ```\n\n2. **Initial Selection:**\n   - We start by selecting the number 1 at position (0,2).\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - We need to select three more numbers such that:\n     - The sum of selected numbers in each row is ≤ 4.\n     - The sum of selected numbers in each column is ≤ 4.\n   - We must select four different numbers.\n\n4. **Analysis of Possible Selections:**\n   - Since we have already selected 1 at (0,2), the remaining sum allowed for row 0 is 3.\n   - For column 2, the remaining sum allowed is 3.\n\n5. **Selecting Additional Numbers:**\n   - We need to select numbers from the remaining cells while respecting the constraints.\n   - Let's consider selecting the number 3 at (0,0). This would make the sum for row 0 equal to 4 (3 + 1), which is valid.\n   - Now, we need to select numbers from rows 1 and 2 such that the sum in each row and column remains ≤ 4.\n\n6. **Further Selection:**\n   - Select the number 2 at (1,2). This makes the sum for column 2 equal to 3 (1 + 2), which is valid.\n   - Now, select the number 3 at (2,2). This makes the sum for column 2 equal to 6 (1 + 2 + 3), which exceeds the limit. So, this selection is invalid.\n\n7. **Re-evaluation:**\n   - Instead, select the number 2 at (1,2) and the number 3 at (2,1).\n   - This makes the sum for column 2 equal to 3 (1 + 2), which is valid.\n   - The sum for row 1 is 2, and for row 2 is 3, both of which are valid.\n\n8. **Final Selection:**\n   - The selected numbers are at positions (0,2), (0,0), (1,2), and (2,1).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 2, 0 0, 1 2, 2 1>>>"
