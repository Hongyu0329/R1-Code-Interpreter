    "To solve this problem, we need to select 10 different numbers from the 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 6 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number. Let's analyze the grid and select the numbers step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis:**\n   - The grid is as follows:\n     ```\n     -4, -5, -7, -6, 6\n      5,  7,  4, -6, -1\n      2, -5, -7,  5,  6\n      4, -6, -3,  3, -3\n      9,  5, -5,  5,  6\n     ```\n   - We need to select 10 numbers such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0.\n\n2. **Initial Selection:**\n   - We start with the number 6 at position (0,4).\n\n3. **Selecting Numbers:**\n   - We need to ensure that the product of numbers in each row and column is positive. This means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column or all positive numbers.\n   - Let's select numbers from each row and column carefully:\n\n4. **Row and Column Analysis:**\n   - **Row 0:** We have already selected 6 at (0,4). We need to select one more number to make the product positive. Select -4 at (0,0).\n   - **Row 1:** Select 5 at (1,0) and 7 at (1,1). The product is positive.\n   - **Row 2:** Select 2 at (2,0) and 5 at (2,3). The product is positive.\n   - **Row 3:** Select 4 at (3,0) and 3 at (3,3). The product is positive.\n   - **Row 4:** Select 9 at (4,0) and 5 at (4,3). The product is positive.\n\n5. **Column Analysis:**\n   - **Column 0:** We have selected -4 at (0,0), 5 at (1,0), 2 at (2,0), 4 at (3,0), and 9 at (4,0). The product is positive.\n   - **Column 1:** We have selected 7 at (1,1). We need to select one more number to make the product positive. Select -5 at (2,1).\n   - **Column 2:** We have not selected any number. Select -7 at (0,2) and -3 at (3,2). The product is positive.\n   - **Column 3:** We have selected 5 at (2,3) and 3 at (3,3). The product is positive.\n   - **Column 4:** We have selected 6 at (0,4). We need to select one more number to make the product positive. Select 6 at (2,4).\n\n6. **Final Selection:**\n   - The selected numbers are at positions:\n     - (0,0), (0,2), (0,4)\n     - (1,0), (1,1)\n     - (2,0), (2,1), (2,3), (2,4)\n     - (3,0), (3,2), (3,3)\n     - (4,0), (4,3)\n\n7. **Ensure 10 Numbers:**\n   - We need exactly 10 numbers. Let's adjust the selection to ensure we have 10 numbers while maintaining the positive product condition.\n\n8. **Adjust Selection:**\n   - Final selection of 10 numbers:\n     - (0,0), (0,4)\n     - (1,0), (1,1)\n     - (2,0), (2,3)\n     - (3,0), (3,3)\n     - (4,0), (4,3)\n\n9. **Verification:**\n   - Verify that each row and column product is positive with the selected numbers.\n\n10. **Final Answer:**\n   - <<<0 0, 0 4, 1 0, 1 1, 2 0, 2 3, 3 0, 3 3, 4 0, 4 3>>>"
