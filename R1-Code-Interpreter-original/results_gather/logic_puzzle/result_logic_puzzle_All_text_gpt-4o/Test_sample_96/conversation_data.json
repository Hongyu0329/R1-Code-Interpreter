  "question": "Given a 7*7 grid where each cell contains a number (between -10 to 14), you must select 16 different numbers from these cells. The product of each row and column of the selected number must be greater than 0.

    "To solve this problem, we need to select 16 different numbers from the 7x7 grid such that the product of the numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We start by selecting the number 6 at position (0,6) as given.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Selection**: Start with the number 6 at position (0,6).\n\n2. **Row and Column Constraints**: \n   - For each row and column, the product of the selected numbers must be positive. This means we need an even number of negative numbers or all positive numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers.\n\n3. **Selection Strategy**:\n   - We need to select 16 numbers, which means we will have some rows and columns with more than one selected number.\n   - We should aim to balance the number of negative and positive numbers in each row and column to ensure the product is positive.\n\n4. **Grid Analysis**:\n   - Analyze each row and column to determine potential selections that satisfy the constraints.\n   - Consider the distribution of negative and positive numbers in the grid.\n\n5. **Selection Process**:\n   - Start with the given number at (0,6).\n   - Select numbers from each row and column ensuring the product constraint is satisfied.\n   - Ensure that the total number of selected numbers is 16.\n\n6. **Example Selection**:\n   - Row 0: Select (0,6) and (0,3) to have a positive product (6 and 13).\n   - Row 1: Select (1,3) and (1,5) to have a positive product (6 and 6).\n   - Row 2: Select (2,0) and (2,3) to have a positive product (7 and 7).\n   - Row 3: Select (3,0) and (3,6) to have a positive product (6 and 9).\n   - Row 4: Select (4,1) and (4,2) to have a positive product (14 and 12).\n   - Row 5: Select (5,2) and (5,3) to have a positive product (14 and 14).\n   - Row 6: Select (6,4) and (6,6) to have a positive product (7 and 9).\n\n7. **Verification**:\n   - Check each row and column to ensure the product of selected numbers is positive.\n   - Ensure the total number of selected numbers is 16.\n\n### Final Answer:\n<<<0 6, 0 3, 1 3, 1 5, 2 0, 2 3, 3 0, 3 6, 4 1, 4 2, 5 2, 5 3, 6 4, 6 6>>>"
