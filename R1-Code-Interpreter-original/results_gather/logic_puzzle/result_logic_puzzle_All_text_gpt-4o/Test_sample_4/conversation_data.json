    "To solve this problem, we need to select three different numbers from a 2x2 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) is already selected. Let's analyze the grid and the constraints step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Representation:**\n   ```\n   (0,0) (0,1)\n   (1,0) (1,1)\n   ```\n   The grid with numbers is:\n   ```\n   3, 2\n   1, 2\n   ```\n\n2. **Selected Number:**\n   - We are given that the number 2 at position (0,1) is already selected.\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - We need to select two more numbers such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4.\n   - We must select three different numbers.\n\n4. **Possible Selections:**\n   - The numbers in the grid are 3, 2, 1, and 2. We need to select three different numbers, so the possible numbers to select are 3, 2, and 1.\n\n5. **Selection Analysis:**\n   - We have already selected 2 at (0,1).\n   - We need to select two more numbers from the remaining positions: (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1).\n\n6. **Checking Constraints:**\n   - If we select 3 at (0,0) and 1 at (1,0), the selections are:\n     - Row 0: 3 (at 0,0) + 2 (at 0,1) = 5 (which exceeds 4, so this is not valid).\n   - If we select 1 at (1,0) and 2 at (1,1), the selections are:\n     - Row 0: 2 (at 0,1) = 2 (valid, as it is less than or equal to 4).\n     - Row 1: 1 (at 1,0) + 2 (at 1,1) = 3 (valid, as it is less than or equal to 4).\n     - Column 0: 1 (at 1,0) = 1 (valid, as it is less than or equal to 4).\n     - Column 1: 2 (at 0,1) + 2 (at 1,1) = 4 (valid, as it is less than or equal to 4).\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - The valid selection that satisfies all constraints is selecting the numbers at positions (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1).\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<0 1, 1 0, 1 1>>>"
