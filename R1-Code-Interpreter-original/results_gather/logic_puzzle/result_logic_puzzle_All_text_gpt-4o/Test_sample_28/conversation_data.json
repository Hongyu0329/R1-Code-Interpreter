    "To solve this problem, we need to select 4 different numbers from the 3x3 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) is the first selected number. Let's analyze the grid and the constraints step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Layout:**\n   ```\n   (0,0) 1, (0,1) 3, (0,2) 2\n   (1,0) 4, (1,1) 1, (1,2) 3\n   (2,0) 3, (2,1) 3, (2,2) 4\n   ```\n\n2. **Initial Selection:**\n   - We start by selecting the number 2 at position (0,2).\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - We need to select 4 different numbers.\n   - The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column should be less than or equal to 4.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Selection:**\n   - **Row 0:** We have already selected 2 at (0,2). The remaining numbers in this row are 1 at (0,0) and 3 at (0,1). We cannot select both 1 and 3 because their sum with 2 would exceed 4. Therefore, we can select 1 at (0,0).\n   - **Row 1:** The numbers are 4 at (1,0), 1 at (1,1), and 3 at (1,2). We cannot select 4 because it would exceed the sum limit. We can select 1 at (1,1).\n   - **Row 2:** The numbers are 3 at (2,0), 3 at (2,1), and 4 at (2,2). We cannot select 4 because it would exceed the sum limit. We can select 3 at (2,0).\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   - **Row 0:** Selected numbers are 1 and 2. Sum = 3.\n   - **Row 1:** Selected number is 1. Sum = 1.\n   - **Row 2:** Selected number is 3. Sum = 3.\n   - **Column 0:** Selected numbers are 1 and 3. Sum = 4.\n   - **Column 1:** Selected number is 1. Sum = 1.\n   - **Column 2:** Selected number is 2. Sum = 2.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The selected numbers are 1 at (0,0), 2 at (0,2), 1 at (1,1), and 3 at (2,0).\n   - All constraints are satisfied.\n\nThe final answer is: <<<0 0, 0 2, 1 1, 2 0>>>"
