    "To solve this problem, we need to select 6 different numbers from the 4x4 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number at position (0,3) is already selected, which is 1. Let's analyze the grid and the constraints step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis:**\n   ```\n   -1, 8, 4, 1\n   3, 4, 6, 1\n   -4, 1, -1, 4\n   -1, 2, 4, -2\n   ```\n\n2. **Initial Selection:**\n   - The number at position (0,3) is 1. This is our starting point.\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - We need to select 6 numbers in total.\n   - The product of numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers must be greater than 0.\n\n4. **Strategy:**\n   - Since the product must be greater than 0, we need to ensure that each row and column with selected numbers has an even number of negative numbers or no negative numbers at all.\n   - We need to carefully choose numbers to satisfy these conditions.\n\n5. **Selection Process:**\n   - Start with the given number at (0,3) which is 1.\n   - We need to select 5 more numbers.\n\n6. **Row and Column Analysis:**\n   - **Row 0:** Already has 1 at (0,3). We can select 8 at (0,1) and 4 at (0,2) to ensure positive product.\n   - **Row 1:** Select 3 at (1,0) and 6 at (1,2) to ensure positive product.\n   - **Row 2:** Select 1 at (2,1) to ensure positive product.\n   - **Row 3:** No need to select from this row as we already have 6 numbers.\n\n7. **Column Analysis:**\n   - **Column 0:** Select 3 at (1,0) to ensure positive product.\n   - **Column 1:** Select 8 at (0,1) and 1 at (2,1) to ensure positive product.\n   - **Column 2:** Select 4 at (0,2) and 6 at (1,2) to ensure positive product.\n   - **Column 3:** Already has 1 at (0,3).\n\n8. **Final Selection:**\n   - The selected numbers are at positions: (0,3), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1).\n\n9. **Verification:**\n   - Check each row and column to ensure the product is positive:\n     - Row 0: 8, 4, 1 -> Product = 32 (positive)\n     - Row 1: 3, 6 -> Product = 18 (positive)\n     - Row 2: 1 -> Product = 1 (positive)\n     - Column 0: 3 -> Product = 3 (positive)\n     - Column 1: 8, 1 -> Product = 8 (positive)\n     - Column 2: 4, 6 -> Product = 24 (positive)\n     - Column 3: 1 -> Product = 1 (positive)\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 3, 0 1, 0 2, 1 0, 1 2, 2 1>>>"
