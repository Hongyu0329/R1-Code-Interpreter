    "To solve this problem, we need to select 10 different numbers from the 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 7 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number. Let's analyze the grid and select the numbers step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis:**\n   - The grid is as follows:\n     ```\n     -8, 5, -9, 6, 7\n     10, -7, 3, 9, 9\n     -2, 7, -5, 10, 1\n     4, 9, 6, -5, 1\n     7, 9, 3, 7, 5\n     ```\n   - We need to select 10 numbers such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0.\n\n2. **Initial Selection:**\n   - We start with the number 7 at position (0,4).\n\n3. **Selecting Numbers:**\n   - We need to ensure that the product of numbers in each row and column is positive. This means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column or all positive numbers.\n   - Let's select numbers from each row and column carefully:\n\n4. **Row and Column Analysis:**\n   - **Row 0:** We have already selected 7 at (0,4). We need to select one more number from this row. Choose 6 at (0,3) to keep the product positive.\n   - **Row 1:** Choose 10 at (1,0) and 9 at (1,3). Both are positive, ensuring a positive product.\n   - **Row 2:** Choose 7 at (2,1) and 10 at (2,3). Both are positive, ensuring a positive product.\n   - **Row 3:** Choose 9 at (3,1) and 6 at (3,2). Both are positive, ensuring a positive product.\n   - **Row 4:** Choose 7 at (4,0) and 5 at (4,4). Both are positive, ensuring a positive product.\n\n5. **Column Analysis:**\n   - **Column 0:** We have 10 at (1,0) and 7 at (4,0). Both are positive.\n   - **Column 1:** We have 7 at (2,1) and 9 at (3,1). Both are positive.\n   - **Column 2:** We have 6 at (3,2). We need to ensure the product is positive, so we don't select any more from this column.\n   - **Column 3:** We have 6 at (0,3), 9 at (1,3), and 10 at (2,3). All are positive.\n   - **Column 4:** We have 7 at (0,4) and 5 at (4,4). Both are positive.\n\n6. **Final Selection:**\n   - The selected positions are: (0,3), (0,4), (1,0), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,4).\n\n7. **Verification:**\n   - Check each row and column to ensure the product of selected numbers is positive. All conditions are satisfied.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 3, 0 4, 1 0, 1 3, 2 1, 2 3, 3 1, 3 2, 4 0, 4 4>>>"
