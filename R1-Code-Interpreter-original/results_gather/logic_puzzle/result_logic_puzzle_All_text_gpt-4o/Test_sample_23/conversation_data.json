The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column should be less than or equal to 4.

    "To solve this problem, we need to select four different numbers from the given 3x3 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) is the first selected number. Let's analyze the grid and constraints step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis:**\n   ```\n   3, 4, 2\n   1, 3, 4\n   4, 4, 3\n   ```\n\n2. **Initial Selection:**\n   - We start by selecting the number 2 at position (0,2).\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - We need to select three more numbers such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4.\n   - We must select four different numbers.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Selection:**\n   - **Row 0:** We have already selected 2 at (0,2). The remaining numbers in this row are 3 and 4. We cannot select both because their sum with 2 would exceed 4. We cannot select any more numbers from this row.\n   - **Row 1:** The numbers are 1, 3, and 4. We can select 1 at (1,0) because it is different from 2 and does not exceed the sum constraint for the row or column.\n   - **Row 2:** The numbers are 4, 4, and 3. We can select 3 at (2,2) because it is different from 2 and 1, and it does not exceed the sum constraint for the row or column.\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   - **Row 0:** Selected number is 2. Sum = 2 (≤ 4).\n   - **Row 1:** Selected number is 1. Sum = 1 (≤ 4).\n   - **Row 2:** Selected number is 3. Sum = 3 (≤ 4).\n   - **Column 0:** Selected number is 1. Sum = 1 (≤ 4).\n   - **Column 1:** No numbers selected. Sum = 0 (≤ 4).\n   - **Column 2:** Selected numbers are 2 and 3. Sum = 5, which exceeds 4. We need to adjust our selection.\n\n6. **Adjustment:**\n   - Since the sum in column 2 exceeds 4, we need to adjust our selection. Let's try selecting 1 at (1,0), 3 at (2,2), and 4 at (2,0).\n\n7. **Final Selection:**\n   - Select 2 at (0,2), 1 at (1,0), 3 at (2,2), and 4 at (2,0).\n\n8. **Verification of Final Selection:**\n   - **Row 0:** Selected number is 2. Sum = 2 (≤ 4).\n   - **Row 1:** Selected number is 1. Sum = 1 (≤ 4).\n   - **Row 2:** Selected numbers are 4 and 3. Sum = 7, which exceeds 4. We need to adjust again.\n\n9. **Correct Selection:**\n   - Select 2 at (0,2), 1 at (1,0), 3 at (1,1), and 3 at (2,2).\n\n10. **Verification of Correct Selection:**\n    - **Row 0:** Selected number is 2. Sum = 2 (≤ 4).\n    - **Row 1:** Selected numbers are 1 and 3. Sum = 4 (≤ 4).\n    - **Row 2:** Selected number is 3. Sum = 3 (≤ 4).\n    - **Column 0:** Selected number is 1. Sum = 1 (≤ 4).\n    - **Column 1:** Selected number is 3. Sum = 3 (≤ 4).\n    - **Column 2:** Selected numbers are 2 and 3. Sum = 5, which exceeds 4. We need to adjust again.\n\n11. **Final Correct Selection:**\n    - Select 2 at (0,2), 1 at (1,0), 3 at (1,1), and 4 at (2,0).\n\n12. **Verification of Final Correct Selection:**\n    - **Row 0:** Selected number is 2. Sum = 2 (≤ 4).\n    - **Row 1:** Selected numbers are 1 and 3. Sum = 4 (≤ 4).\n    - **Row 2:** Selected number is 4. Sum = 4 (≤ 4).\n    - **Column 0:** Selected numbers are 1 and 4.
