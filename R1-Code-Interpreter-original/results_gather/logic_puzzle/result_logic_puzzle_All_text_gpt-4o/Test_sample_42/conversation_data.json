    "To solve this problem, we need to select 6 different numbers from the 4x4 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number at position (0,3) is already selected. Let's analyze the grid and the constraints step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis:**\n   ```\n   8,  4,  5,  1\n   1, -4, -1,  4\n  -5, -3,  7,  6\n   4,  1,  7,  5\n   ```\n\n2. **Initial Selection:**\n   - The number at position (0,3) is 1. This is our first selected number.\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - We need to select 6 numbers in total.\n   - The product of selected numbers in each row and column must be greater than 0.\n\n4. **Strategy:**\n   - Since the product must be greater than 0, we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column of selected numbers.\n   - We should aim to select numbers that are either all positive or have an even number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n\n5. **Selection Process:**\n   - Start with the given number at (0,3) which is 1 (positive).\n   - We need to select 5 more numbers.\n\n6. **Row and Column Analysis:**\n   - **Row 0:** We have selected (0,3). We can select (0,0) which is 8 (positive).\n   - **Row 1:** We can select (1,0) which is 1 (positive) and (1,3) which is 4 (positive).\n   - **Row 2:** We can select (2,2) which is 7 (positive).\n   - **Row 3:** We can select (3,0) which is 4 (positive).\n\n7. **Verification:**\n   - **Row 0:** Selected numbers are (0,0) and (0,3) -> 8 and 1. Product = 8 (positive).\n   - **Row 1:** Selected numbers are (1,0) and (1,3) -> 1 and 4. Product = 4 (positive).\n   - **Row 2:** Selected number is (2,2) -> 7. Product = 7 (positive).\n   - **Row 3:** Selected number is (3,0) -> 4. Product = 4 (positive).\n   - **Column 0:** Selected numbers are (0,0), (1,0), and (3,0) -> 8, 1, and 4. Product = 32 (positive).\n   - **Column 2:** Selected number is (2,2) -> 7. Product = 7 (positive).\n   - **Column 3:** Selected numbers are (0,3) and (1,3) -> 1 and 4. Product = 4 (positive).\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   - All selected numbers satisfy the condition that the product of each row and column is greater than 0.\n\nThe selected positions are: <<<0 3, 0 0, 1 0, 1 3, 2 2, 3 0>>>."
