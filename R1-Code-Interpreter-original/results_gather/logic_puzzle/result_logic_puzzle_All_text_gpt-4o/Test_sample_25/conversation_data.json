    "To solve this problem, we need to select four different numbers from the given 3x3 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 1 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) is the first selected number. Let's analyze the grid and constraints step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis:**\n   ```\n   2, 1, 1\n   4, 2, 3\n   3, 3, 3\n   ```\n\n2. **Initial Selection:**\n   - We start by selecting the number 1 at position (0,2).\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - We need to select three more numbers such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4.\n   - We must select four different numbers.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Selection:**\n   - **Row 0:** We have already selected 1 at (0,2). The remaining numbers in this row are 2 at (0,0) and 1 at (0,1).\n   - **Row 1:** The numbers are 4 at (1,0), 2 at (1,1), and 3 at (1,2).\n   - **Row 2:** The numbers are 3 at (2,0), 3 at (2,1), and 3 at (2,2).\n\n5. **Selecting Additional Numbers:**\n   - We need to ensure that the sum in each row and column remains ≤ 4.\n   - Since we have already selected 1 at (0,2), we can select 1 at (0,1) to keep the sum in row 0 as 2, which is ≤ 4.\n   - Next, we can select 2 at (1,1) to keep the sum in row 1 as 2, which is ≤ 4.\n   - Finally, we can select 3 at (2,0) to keep the sum in row 2 as 3, which is ≤ 4.\n\n6. **Verification:**\n   - **Row 0:** Selected numbers are 1 (at 0,2) and 1 (at 0,1). Sum = 2.\n   - **Row 1:** Selected number is 2 (at 1,1). Sum = 2.\n   - **Row 2:** Selected number is 3 (at 2,0). Sum = 3.\n   - **Column 0:** Selected number is 3 (at 2,0). Sum = 3.\n   - **Column 1:** Selected numbers are 1 (at 0,1) and 2 (at 1,1). Sum = 3.\n   - **Column 2:** Selected number is 1 (at 0,2). Sum = 1.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - All selected numbers are different: 1, 1, 2, 3.\n   - The sum in each row and column is ≤ 4.\n\nThe selected positions are:\n<<<0 2, 0 1, 1 1, 2 0>>>"
