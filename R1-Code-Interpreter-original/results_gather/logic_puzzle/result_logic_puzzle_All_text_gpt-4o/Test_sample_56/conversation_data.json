    "To solve this problem, we need to select 9 different numbers from the 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number -1 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number. Let's analyze the grid and select the numbers step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Selection**: We start with the number -1 at position (0,4).\n\n2. **Row and Column Analysis**:\n   - For the product of each row and column to be greater than 0, the product must be positive. This means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column or no negative numbers at all.\n\n3. **Grid Analysis**:\n   - Row 0: -5, 7, -7, 6, -1\n   - Row 1: -2, 2, 8, 6, -3\n   - Row 2: 3, 4, 4, 3, 8\n   - Row 3: -8, -2, 5, 8, 2\n   - Row 4: -2, 6, 8, 2, -1\n\n4. **Selection Strategy**:\n   - We need to select numbers such that each row and column has an even number of negative numbers or no negative numbers.\n   - We already have one negative number in column 4 (0,4). We need to balance this with another negative number in the same column or ensure other columns have an even count of negative numbers.\n\n5. **Step-by-Step Selection**:\n   - **Row 0**: We have -5, 7, -7, 6, -1. We already have -1. We can select 7 and 6 to make the product positive.\n   - **Row 1**: Select 2 and 8. This row has -2 and -3, but selecting 2 and 8 ensures a positive product.\n   - **Row 2**: Select 3 and 4. This row has all positive numbers, so any selection will work.\n   - **Row 3**: Select 5 and 8. This row has -8 and -2, but selecting 5 and 8 ensures a positive product.\n   - **Row 4**: Select 6 and 8. This row has -2 and -1, but selecting 6 and 8 ensures a positive product.\n\n6. **Final Selection**:\n   - (0,4): -1\n   - (0,1): 7\n   - (0,3): 6\n   - (1,1): 2\n   - (1,2): 8\n   - (2,0): 3\n   - (2,1): 4\n   - (3,2): 5\n   - (3,3): 8\n\n7. **Verification**:\n   - Check each row and column to ensure the product is positive:\n     - Row 0: 7, 6, -1 (Product: 7 * 6 * -1 = -42, which is negative, so adjust selection)\n     - Row 1: 2, 8 (Product: 2 * 8 = 16, positive)\n     - Row 2: 3, 4 (Product: 3 * 4 = 12, positive)\n     - Row 3: 5, 8 (Product: 5 * 8 = 40, positive)\n     - Row 4: 6, 8 (Product: 6 * 8 = 48, positive)\n\n   - Adjust selection for Row 0 to ensure positive product:\n     - Select -5, 7, 6 instead of -1, 7, 6 to balance negatives.\n\n8. **Corrected Final Selection**:\n   - (0,0): -5\n   - (0,1): 7\n   - (0,3): 6\n   - (1,1): 2\n   - (1,2): 8\n   - (2,0): 3\n   - (2,1): 4\n   - (3,2): 5\n   - (3,3): 8\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 0, 0 1, 0 3, 1 1, 1 2, 2 0, 2 1, 3 2, 3 3>>>"
