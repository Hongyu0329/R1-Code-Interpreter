    "To solve this problem, we need to select 9 different numbers from the 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number -3 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Grid and Constraints:**\n   - We have a 5x5 grid with numbers ranging from -8 to 8.\n   - We need to select 9 numbers such that the product of numbers in each row and column is greater than 0.\n   - The product being greater than 0 implies that the product must be positive, which means it can either be all positive numbers or an even number of negative numbers.\n\n2. **Initial Selection:**\n   - We start with the number -3 at position (0,4).\n\n3. **Strategy for Selection:**\n   - We need to ensure that each row and column with selected numbers has a positive product.\n   - Since we have 5 rows and 5 columns, and we need to select 9 numbers, some rows and columns will have more than one selected number.\n   - We need to balance the number of negative numbers in each row and column to ensure a positive product.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Selection:**\n   - Start with the given number -3 at (0,4).\n   - Select numbers such that each row and column has a positive product.\n   - Consider the distribution of negative and positive numbers in the grid.\n\n5. **Selection Process:**\n   - Row 0: We have -3 at (0,4). To make the product positive, we need another negative number or positive numbers. Select 3 at (0,3).\n   - Row 1: Select 4 at (1,0) and 8 at (1,1) to ensure a positive product.\n   - Row 2: Select 7 at (2,2) and -8 at (2,3) to balance the negatives.\n   - Row 3: Select 6 at (3,0) and 4 at (3,3) for a positive product.\n   - Row 4: Select 8 at (4,0) to ensure a positive product.\n\n6. **Verification:**\n   - Check each row and column to ensure the product is positive.\n   - Row 0: 3, -3 (positive product)\n   - Row 1: 4, 8 (positive product)\n   - Row 2: 7, -8 (positive product)\n   - Row 3: 6, 4 (positive product)\n   - Row 4: 8 (positive product)\n   - Column 0: 4, 6, 8 (positive product)\n   - Column 1: 8 (positive product)\n   - Column 2: 7 (positive product)\n   - Column 3: 3, 4 (positive product)\n   - Column 4: -3 (positive product)\n\n7. **Final Selection:**\n   - The selected positions are: (0,3), (0,4), (1,0), (1,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,0), (3,3), (4,0).\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 3, 0 4, 1 0, 1 1, 2 2, 2 3, 3 0, 3 3, 4 0>>>"
