    "To solve this problem, we need to select 6 different numbers from the 4x4 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number at position (0,3), which is -1, is already selected. Let's analyze the grid and the requirements step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis:**\n   ```\n   -4,  5,  7, -1\n    2, -4, -2, -5\n    6,  6, -4,  4\n   -1,  2,  1, -1\n   ```\n\n2. **Initial Selection:**\n   - We start with the number at position (0,3), which is -1.\n\n3. **Objective:**\n   - Select 5 more numbers such that the product of each row and column containing the selected numbers is greater than 0.\n\n4. **Constraints:**\n   - The product of numbers in each row and column must be positive, meaning it must be either all positive or an even number of negative numbers.\n\n5. **Strategy:**\n   - We need to ensure that each row and column with selected numbers has an even number of negative numbers or all positive numbers.\n\n6. **Step-by-Step Selection:**\n   - **Row 0:** Already has -1 at (0,3). We need another negative number to make the product positive. Choose -4 at (0,0).\n   - **Row 1:** Choose 2 at (1,0) and -4 at (1,1). This gives a product of -8, which is negative, so we need another negative number. Choose -5 at (1,3).\n   - **Row 2:** Choose 6 at (2,0) and 4 at (2,3). The product is positive.\n   - **Row 3:** Choose 2 at (3,1) and 1 at (3,2). The product is positive.\n\n7. **Verification:**\n   - **Column 0:** Contains -4 (0,0), 2 (1,0), and 6 (2,0). Product is positive.\n   - **Column 1:** Contains -4 (1,1) and 2 (3,1). Product is negative, but we need another negative number. Choose 5 at (0,1).\n   - **Column 2:** Contains 1 (3,2). Product is positive.\n   - **Column 3:** Contains -1 (0,3), -5 (1,3), and 4 (2,3). Product is positive.\n\n8. **Final Selection:**\n   - The selected positions are: (0,0), (0,1), (0,3), (1,0), (1,1), (1,3).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n<<<0 0, 0 1, 0 3, 1 0, 1 1, 1 3>>>"
