    "To solve this problem, we need to select 10 different numbers from the 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number -6 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number. Let's analyze the grid and select the numbers step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis:**\n   - The grid is as follows:\n     ```\n     -5, 3, 2, 10, -6\n     4, 7, 7, 2, 4\n     2, -7, -3, 7, 3\n     -1, 8, 9, 8, -9\n     -6, 2, -3, 9, 10\n     ```\n   - We need to select 10 numbers such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0.\n\n2. **Initial Selection:**\n   - We start with the number -6 at position (0,4).\n\n3. **Selecting Numbers:**\n   - We need to ensure that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive. This means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Selection:**\n   - **Row 0:** We have -6 at (0,4). To make the product positive, we need another negative number. Select -5 at (0,0).\n   - **Row 1:** Select 4 at (1,0) and 7 at (1,1). Both are positive, so the product is positive.\n   - **Row 2:** Select 2 at (2,0) and -3 at (2,2). The product is negative, so we need another negative number. Select -7 at (2,1).\n   - **Row 3:** Select 8 at (3,1) and 9 at (3,2). Both are positive, so the product is positive.\n   - **Row 4:** Select -6 at (4,0) and 10 at (4,4). The product is negative, so we need another negative number. Select -3 at (4,2).\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   - **Row 0:** (-5) * (-6) = 30 (positive)\n   - **Row 1:** 4 * 7 = 28 (positive)\n   - **Row 2:** 2 * (-7) * (-3) = 42 (positive)\n   - **Row 3:** 8 * 9 = 72 (positive)\n   - **Row 4:** (-6) * (-3) * 10 = 180 (positive)\n   - **Column 0:** (-5) * 4 * 2 * (-6) = 240 (positive)\n   - **Column 1:** 7 * (-7) * 8 = -392 (negative, need adjustment)\n   - **Column 2:** (-3) * 9 * (-3) = 81 (positive)\n   - **Column 3:** 10 (positive)\n   - **Column 4:** (-6) * 4 * 10 = -240 (negative, need adjustment)\n\n6. **Adjustments:**\n   - For column 1, we need to adjust to make the product positive. We can select 3 at (0,1) instead of 7 at (1,1).\n   - For column 4, we need to adjust to make the product positive. We can select 3 at (2,4) instead of 4 at (1,4).\n\n7. **Final Selection:**\n   - After adjustments, the selected positions are:\n     - (0,0), (0,1), (0,4)\n     - (1,0)\n     - (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n     - (3,1), (3,2)\n     - (4,0), (4,2), (4,4)\n\n8. **Final Answer:**\n   - <<<0 0, 0 1, 0 4, 1 0, 2 0, 2 1, 2 2, 3 1, 3 2, 4 0, 4 2, 4 4>>>"
