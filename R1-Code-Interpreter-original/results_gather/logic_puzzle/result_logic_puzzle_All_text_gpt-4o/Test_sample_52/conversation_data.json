    "To solve this problem, we need to select 9 different numbers from the 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number. Let's analyze the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Understand the Grid and Constraints:**\n   - We have a 5x5 grid with numbers ranging from -7 to 7.\n   - We need to select 9 numbers such that the product of numbers in each row and column is greater than 0.\n   - The number at position (0,4) is already selected.\n\n2. **Initial Selection:**\n   - Start with the number at (0,4), which is 2.\n\n3. **Product Constraint:**\n   - For the product of numbers in a row or column to be greater than 0, the number of negative numbers must be even, or all numbers must be positive.\n\n4. **Strategy:**\n   - We need to ensure that each row and column with selected numbers has an even number of negative numbers or all positive numbers.\n   - We will select numbers such that each row and column with selected numbers satisfies this condition.\n\n5. **Selection Process:**\n   - Start with the given number at (0,4).\n   - Select numbers from each row and column, ensuring the product condition is met.\n\n6. **Step-by-Step Selection:**\n   - Row 0: Already have (0,4). Select (0,0) and (0,3) to make the product positive: 1, 5, 2.\n   - Row 1: Select (1,2) and (1,3) to make the product positive: 7, 4.\n   - Row 2: Select (2,2) and (2,4) to make the product positive: 4, 6.\n   - Row 3: Select (3,3) to make the product positive: 4.\n   - Row 4: Select (4,2) to make the product positive: 6.\n\n7. **Verification:**\n   - Check each row and column to ensure the product of selected numbers is positive.\n   - Row 0: 1, 5, 2 (positive)\n   - Row 1: 7, 4 (positive)\n   - Row 2: 4, 6 (positive)\n   - Row 3: 4 (positive)\n   - Row 4: 6 (positive)\n   - Column 2: 7, 4, 6 (positive)\n   - Column 3: 5, 4, 4 (positive)\n   - Column 4: 2, 6 (positive)\n\n8. **Final Selection:**\n   - The selected positions are: (0,0), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2).\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 0, 0 3, 0 4, 1 2, 1 3, 2 2, 2 4, 3 3, 4 2>>>"
