    "To solve this problem, we need to select three different numbers from a 2x2 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 3 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) is already selected. Let's analyze the grid and the constraints step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Representation:**\n   ```\n   (0,0) (0,1)\n   (1,0) (1,1)\n   ```\n\n   Given grid:\n   ```\n   1, 3\n   3, 2\n   ```\n\n2. **Selected Number:**\n   - The number 3 at position (0,1) is already selected.\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - We need to select two more numbers such that:\n     - The sum of the selected numbers in each row is ≤ 4.\n     - The sum of the selected numbers in each column is ≤ 4.\n\n4. **Possible Selections:**\n   - We have the following numbers and positions to consider:\n     - (0,0): 1\n     - (1,0): 3\n     - (1,1): 2\n\n5. **Analysis:**\n   - Since (0,1) is already selected with the number 3, we need to select two more numbers from the remaining positions: (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1).\n   - We need to ensure that the sum in each row and column does not exceed 4.\n\n6. **Selection Strategy:**\n   - Select (0,0): 1\n     - Row 0 sum: 1 + 3 = 4 (valid)\n     - Column 0 sum: 1 (valid)\n   - Select (1,1): 2\n     - Row 1 sum: 2 (valid)\n     - Column 1 sum: 3 + 2 = 5 (invalid)\n\n   The above selection is invalid due to column 1 sum exceeding 4.\n\n   - Instead, select (1,0): 3\n     - Row 1 sum: 3 (valid)\n     - Column 0 sum: 1 + 3 = 4 (valid)\n     - Column 1 sum: 3 (valid)\n\n   This selection satisfies all constraints.\n\n7. **Final Selection:**\n   - The selected positions are (0,1), (0,0), and (1,0).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<0 1, 0 0, 1 0>>>"
