    "To solve this problem, we need to select 6 different numbers from the 4x4 grid such that the product of the numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number -2 at position (0,3) is already selected. Let's analyze the grid and the constraints step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis:**\n   ```\n   1,  2,  4, -2\n  -4,  3,  3,  1\n   2,  1,  7,  2\n   7, -3,  7, -3\n   ```\n\n2. **Initial Selection:**\n   - We start with the number -2 at position (0,3).\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - We need to select 6 numbers in total.\n   - The product of the numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers must be greater than 0.\n\n4. **Strategy:**\n   - Since we have a negative number (-2) in the first row, we need to ensure that the product of the selected numbers in this row is positive. This means we need an even number of negative numbers in the row.\n   - Similarly, for the column containing -2, we need an even number of negative numbers to ensure a positive product.\n\n5. **Selection Process:**\n   - **Row 0:** We have -2 at (0,3). To make the product positive, we can select two more numbers from this row. Let's choose 1 at (0,0) and 4 at (0,2). Now, the product for row 0 is 1 * 4 * (-2) = -8, which is negative. We need to adjust this later.\n   - **Column 3:** We have -2 at (0,3). We need to select another number from this column to make the product positive. Let's choose 2 at (2,3). Now, the product for column 3 is -2 * 2 = -4, which is negative. We need to adjust this later.\n   - **Row 2:** We have 2 at (2,3). Let's select 7 at (2,2) to make the product positive. Now, the product for row 2 is 2 * 7 = 14, which is positive.\n   - **Column 2:** We have 7 at (2,2). Let's select 3 at (1,2) to make the product positive. Now, the product for column 2 is 4 * 3 * 7 = 84, which is positive.\n   - **Row 1:** We have 3 at (1,2). Let's select 3 at (1,1) to make the product positive. Now, the product for row 1 is 3 * 3 = 9, which is positive.\n   - **Column 1:** We have 3 at (1,1). Let's select 2 at (0,1) to make the product positive. Now, the product for column 1 is 2 * 3 = 6, which is positive.\n\n6. **Final Check:**\n   - We have selected the numbers at positions (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), and (2,2). However, we need only 6 numbers.\n   - Let's remove one number while maintaining the positive product condition. We can remove (0,0) since it doesn't affect the positive product condition for row 0 or column 0.\n\n7. **Final Selection:**\n   - The selected positions are (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), and (2,2).\n\nThe final answer is: <<<0 1, 0 2, 0 3, 1 1, 1 2, 2 2>>>"
