    "To solve this problem, we need to select four different numbers from the given 3x3 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 3 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) is the first selected number. Let's analyze the grid and constraints step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis:**\n   ```\n   3, 1, 3\n   1, 1, 2\n   4, 3, 4\n   ```\n\n2. **Initial Selection:**\n   - We start by selecting the number 3 at position (0,2).\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - We need to select three more numbers such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4.\n   - We must select four different numbers.\n\n4. **Step-by-Step Selection:**\n   - **Row 0:** We have already selected 3 at (0,2). The remaining numbers in this row are 3 and 1. We cannot select another 3 because we need four different numbers. So, we can select 1 at (0,1).\n   - **Row 1:** The numbers are 1, 1, and 2. We can select 1 at (1,0) because it is different from the numbers already selected (3 and 1).\n   - **Row 2:** The numbers are 4, 3, and 4. We can select 4 at (2,0) because it is different from the numbers already selected (3, 1, and 1).\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   - **Row 0:** Selected numbers are 3 (at 0,2) and 1 (at 0,1). Sum = 3 + 1 = 4.\n   - **Row 1:** Selected number is 1 (at 1,0). Sum = 1.\n   - **Row 2:** Selected number is 4 (at 2,0). Sum = 4.\n   - **Column 0:** Selected numbers are 1 (at 1,0) and 4 (at 2,0). Sum = 1 + 4 = 5 (This exceeds 4, so we need to adjust).\n   - **Column 1:** Selected number is 1 (at 0,1). Sum = 1.\n   - **Column 2:** Selected number is 3 (at 0,2). Sum = 3.\n\n6. **Adjustment:**\n   - Since the sum in column 0 exceeds 4, we need to adjust our selection. Let's try selecting 1 at (1,1) instead of (1,0).\n   - **New Selection:**\n     - (0,2) = 3\n     - (0,1) = 1\n     - (1,1) = 1\n     - (2,0) = 4\n\n7. **Verification After Adjustment:**\n   - **Row 0:** Selected numbers are 3 (at 0,2) and 1 (at 0,1). Sum = 3 + 1 = 4.\n   - **Row 1:** Selected number is 1 (at 1,1). Sum = 1.\n   - **Row 2:** Selected number is 4 (at 2,0). Sum = 4.\n   - **Column 0:** Selected number is 4 (at 2,0). Sum = 4.\n   - **Column 1:** Selected numbers are 1 (at 0,1) and 1 (at 1,1). Sum = 1 + 1 = 2.\n   - **Column 2:** Selected number is 3 (at 0,2). Sum = 3.\n\nAll constraints are satisfied with this selection.\n\nFinal answer: <<<0 2, 0 1, 1 1, 2 0>>>"
