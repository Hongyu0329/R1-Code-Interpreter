    "To solve this problem, we need to select 12 different numbers from the 6x6 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We start by selecting the number 8 at position (0,5) as given.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1. **Initial Selection**: Start with the number 8 at position (0,5).\n\n2. **Understanding the Grid**: \n   - The grid is 6x6, and we need to select 12 numbers.\n   - Each row and column of the selected numbers must have a product greater than 0, meaning the product must be positive.\n\n3. **Positive Product Requirement**:\n   - A positive product can be achieved by selecting an even number of negative numbers or all positive numbers in each row and column.\n\n4. **Strategy**:\n   - Since we need to select 12 numbers, we can aim to select 2 numbers from each row, ensuring that the product of each row and column remains positive.\n   - We need to carefully choose numbers such that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive.\n\n5. **Selection Process**:\n   - **Row 0**: We have already selected (0,5). Choose another positive number, (0,0) which is 12.\n   - **Row 1**: Choose (1,1) which is 8 and (1,3) which is 3.\n   - **Row 2**: Choose (2,0) which is 5 and (2,4) which is 9.\n   - **Row 3**: Choose (3,0) which is 7 and (3,5) which is 6.\n   - **Row 4**: Choose (4,2) which is 10 and (4,5) which is 12.\n   - **Row 5**: Choose (5,1) which is 11 and (5,3) which is 8.\n\n6. **Verification**:\n   - **Row 0**: (12, 8) -> Product = 96 (positive)\n   - **Row 1**: (8, 3) -> Product = 24 (positive)\n   - **Row 2**: (5, 9) -> Product = 45 (positive)\n   - **Row 3**: (7, 6) -> Product = 42 (positive)\n   - **Row 4**: (10, 12) -> Product = 120 (positive)\n   - **Row 5**: (11, 8) -> Product = 88 (positive)\n\n   - **Column 0**: (12, 5, 7) -> Product = 420 (positive)\n   - **Column 1**: (8, 11) -> Product = 88 (positive)\n   - **Column 2**: (10) -> Product = 10 (positive)\n   - **Column 3**: (3, 8) -> Product = 24 (positive)\n   - **Column 4**: (9) -> Product = 9 (positive)\n   - **Column 5**: (8, 6, 12) -> Product = 576 (positive)\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - All rows and columns have a positive product with the selected numbers.\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 0, 0 5, 1 1, 1 3, 2 0, 2 4, 3 0, 3 5, 4 2, 4 5, 5 1, 5 3>>>"
