    "To solve this problem, we need to select three different numbers from a 2x2 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) is already selected. Let's analyze the grid and the constraints step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Representation:**\n   - The grid is:\n     ```\n     1, 2\n     3, 1\n     ```\n   - In terms of coordinates, the grid is:\n     ```\n     (0,0): 1, (0,1): 2\n     (1,0): 3, (1,1): 1\n     ```\n\n2. **Selected Number:**\n   - We are given that the number 2 at position (0,1) is already selected.\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - We need to select two more numbers such that:\n     - The sum of the selected numbers in each row is ≤ 4.\n     - The sum of the selected numbers in each column is ≤ 4.\n\n4. **Selection Process:**\n   - Since (0,1) is already selected, we need to select two more numbers from the remaining positions: (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1).\n\n5. **Checking Possible Combinations:**\n   - Let's consider selecting (0,0) and (1,0):\n     - Selected numbers: 2 (at 0,1), 1 (at 0,0), 3 (at 1,0).\n     - Row sums:\n       - Row 0: 1 (at 0,0) + 2 (at 0,1) = 3 (≤ 4)\n       - Row 1: 3 (at 1,0) = 3 (≤ 4)\n     - Column sums:\n       - Column 0: 1 (at 0,0) + 3 (at 1,0) = 4 (≤ 4)\n       - Column 1: 2 (at 0,1) = 2 (≤ 4)\n     - This combination satisfies all constraints.\n\n   - Let's consider selecting (0,0) and (1,1):\n     - Selected numbers: 2 (at 0,1), 1 (at 0,0), 1 (at 1,1).\n     - Row sums:\n       - Row 0: 1 (at 0,0) + 2 (at 0,1) = 3 (≤ 4)\n       - Row 1: 1 (at 1,1) = 1 (≤ 4)\n     - Column sums:\n       - Column 0: 1 (at 0,0) = 1 (≤ 4)\n       - Column 1: 2 (at 0,1) + 1 (at 1,1) = 3 (≤ 4)\n     - This combination also satisfies all constraints.\n\n   - Let's consider selecting (1,0) and (1,1):\n     - Selected numbers: 2 (at 0,1), 3 (at 1,0), 1 (at 1,1).\n     - Row sums:\n       - Row 0: 2 (at 0,1) = 2 (≤ 4)\n       - Row 1: 3 (at 1,0) + 1 (at 1,1) = 4 (≤ 4)\n     - Column sums:\n       - Column 0: 3 (at 1,0) = 3 (≤ 4)\n       - Column 1: 2 (at 0,1) + 1 (at 1,1) = 3 (≤ 4)\n     - This combination also satisfies all constraints.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - All three combinations satisfy the constraints, but we need to select one. Let's choose the first valid combination for simplicity.\n\nThe selected positions are: <<<0 1, 0 0, 1 0>>>."
