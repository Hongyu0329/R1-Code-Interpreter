    "To solve this problem, we need to select three different numbers from a 2x2 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) is already selected. Let's analyze the grid and the constraints step by step:\n\n1. **Grid Layout and Initial Selection:**\n   - The grid is:\n     ```\n     1, 2\n     3, 1\n     ```\n   - The coordinates for the grid are:\n     - (0,0) = 1\n     - (0,1) = 2\n     - (1,0) = 3\n     - (1,1) = 1\n   - We are given that the number 2 at position (0,1) is already selected.\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - We need to select two more numbers such that:\n     - The sum of the selected numbers in each row is ≤ 4.\n     - The sum of the selected numbers in each column is ≤ 4.\n\n3. **Selection Process:**\n   - We have already selected the number 2 at (0,1).\n   - We need to select two more numbers from the remaining positions: (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1).\n\n4. **Checking Possible Combinations:**\n   - Let's consider selecting the number at (0,0) which is 1:\n     - Selected numbers: 2 (at 0,1) and 1 (at 0,0).\n     - Sum of row 0: 1 + 2 = 3 (which is ≤ 4).\n   - Now, we need to select one more number from row 1:\n     - If we select the number at (1,0) which is 3:\n       - Selected numbers: 2 (at 0,1), 1 (at 0,0), and 3 (at 1,0).\n       - Sum of row 1: 3 (which is ≤ 4).\n       - Sum of column 0: 1 (at 0,0) + 3 (at 1,0) = 4 (which is ≤ 4).\n       - Sum of column 1: 2 (at 0,1) (which is ≤ 4).\n     - This selection satisfies all constraints.\n\n5. **Final Selection:**\n   - The selected numbers are at positions (0,1), (0,0), and (1,0).\n\nTherefore, the answer is: <<<0 1, 0 0, 1 0>>>"
