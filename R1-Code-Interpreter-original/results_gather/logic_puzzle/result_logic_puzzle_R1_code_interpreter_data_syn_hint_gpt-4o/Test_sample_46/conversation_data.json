The product of each row and column of the selected number must be greater than 0.

    "To solve this problem, we need to select 6 different numbers from the given 4x4 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number at position (0,3) is already selected.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial Selection**: We start with the number at position (0,3), which is 1. This number is neutral for multiplication, so it doesn't affect the sign of the product.\n\n2. **Constraints**: \n   - We need to select 6 numbers in total.\n   - The product of numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers must be greater than 0. This means the product must be positive.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - We need to ensure that the product of numbers in each row and column is positive. This can be achieved by having an even number of negative numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers.\n   - We need to carefully choose numbers such that the above condition is satisfied.\n\n4. **Grid Analysis**:\n   - Row 0: [-1, 4, -3, 1]\n   - Row 1: [-1, 3, 3, -4]\n   - Row 2: [6, 8, -2, 7]\n   - Row 3: [-2, 5, 7, -3]\n\n5. **Selection Process**:\n   - We already have (0,3) selected.\n   - We need to select 5 more numbers ensuring the product condition.\n\nLet's try to select numbers and check the conditions:\n\n- Select (0,1) = 4, (1,0) = -1, (1,2) = 3, (2,0) = 6, (3,2) = 7\n\nNow, let's check the product conditions:\n\n- Row 0: 1, 4 (Product = 4, positive)\n- Row 1: -1, 3 (Product = -3, negative)\n- Row 2: 6 (Product = 6, positive)\n- Row 3: 7 (Product = 7, positive)\n\n- Column 0: -1, 6 (Product = -6, negative)\n- Column 1: 4 (Product = 4, positive)\n- Column 2: 3, 7 (Product = 21, positive)\n- Column 3: 1 (Product = 1, positive)\n\nWe need to adjust the selection to ensure all products are positive.
