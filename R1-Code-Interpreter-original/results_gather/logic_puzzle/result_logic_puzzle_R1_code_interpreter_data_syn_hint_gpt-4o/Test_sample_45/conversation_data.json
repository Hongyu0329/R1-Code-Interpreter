    "To solve this problem, we need to select 6 different numbers from the given 4x4 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number -2 at position (0,3) is already selected.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**: \n   - The grid is:\n     ```\n     1, 2, 4, -2\n     -4, 3, 3, 1\n     2, 1, 7, 2\n     7, -3, 7, -3\n     ```\n   - We need to select 5 more numbers in addition to the number at (0,3).\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - The product of selected numbers in each row and column must be greater than 0.\n   - This implies that each row and column with selected numbers must have an even number of negative numbers or no negative numbers at all.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Start with the given number -2 at (0,3).\n   - Select numbers such that the product of each row and column remains positive.\n   - Ensure that the total number of selected numbers is 6.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - We will iterate over possible combinations of numbers and check if they satisfy the conditions.\n   - We will use Python to automate the checking process.\n\nLet's write a Python script to find a valid selection of numbers.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [1, 2, 4, -2],\n    [-4, 3, 3, 1],\n    [2, 1, 7, 2],\n    [7, -3, 7, -3]\n]\n\n# Pre-select the given number\nselected_positions = [(0, 3)]\n\n# Function to check if the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive\ndef is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n    row_products = [1] * 4\n    col_products = [1] * 4\n    \n    for r, c in selected_positions:\n        row_products[r] *= grid[r][c]\n        col_products[c] *= grid[r][c]\n    \n    return all(p > 0 for p in row_products) and all(p > 0 for p in col_products)\n\n# Generate all possible combinations of 5 additional positions\nall_positions = [(r, c) for r in range(4) for c in range(4) if (r, c) != (0, 3)]\nfor additional_positions in combinations(all_positions, 5):\n    current_selection = selected_positions + list(additional_positions)\n    if is_valid_selection(current_selection):\n        # Convert positions to the required format\n        result = ', '.join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in current_selection)\n        print(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n        break\n```\n\nThis script will find a valid selection of numbers that satisfies the given conditions. Let's execute it to get the answer."
