    "To solve this problem, we need to select three different numbers from the given 2x2 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) is already selected.\n\nThe grid is as follows:\n\n```\n3, 2\n1, 2\n```\n\nThe coordinates for each cell are:\n- (0,0): 3\n- (0,1): 2\n- (1,0): 1\n- (1,1): 2\n\nWe have already selected the number 2 at position (0,1). Now, we need to select two more numbers from the remaining cells: (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1).\n\nLet's consider the constraints:\n1. The sum of the selected numbers in each row should be ≤ 4.\n2. The sum of the selected numbers in each column should be ≤ 4.\n\nLet's evaluate the possible selections:\n\n1. Select (0,1) = 2 (already selected)\n2. Select (0,0) = 3\n3. Select (1,0) = 1\n\nChecking the sums:\n- Row 0: 3 + 2 = 5 (exceeds 4)\n- Column 0: 3 + 1 = 4 (valid)\n- Column 1: 2 (valid)\n\nThis selection is invalid because the sum in Row 0 exceeds 4.\n\nLet's try another combination:\n\n1. Select (0,1) = 2 (already selected)\n2. Select (0,0) = 3\n3. Select (1,1) = 2\n\nChecking the sums:\n- Row 0: 3 + 2 = 5 (exceeds 4)\n- Column 0: 3 (valid)\n- Column 1: 2 + 2 = 4 (valid)\n\nThis selection is invalid because the sum in Row 0 exceeds 4.\n\nLet's try another combination:\n\n1. Select (0,1) = 2 (already selected)\n2. Select (1,0) = 1\n3. Select (1,1) = 2\n\nChecking the sums:\n- Row 0: 2 (valid)\n- Row 1: 1 + 2 = 3 (valid)\n- Column 0: 1 (valid)\n- Column 1: 2 + 2 = 4 (valid)\n\nThis selection is valid because all sums are ≤ 4.\n\nTherefore, the valid selection is:\n- (0,1): 2\n- (1,0): 1\n- (1,1): 2\n\nThe positions of the selected numbers are (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1).\n\n<<<0 1, 1 0, 1 1>>>"
