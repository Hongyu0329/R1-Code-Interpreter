  "question": "Given a 3*3 grid where each cell contains a number (between 1 to 4), you must select 4 different numbers from these cells. The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column should be less than or equal to 4. The numbers in the same row are separated by ',', and the coordinate system uses the top-left cell as the coordinate (1,1), with the horizontal coordinate under the top-left cell increasing and the vertical coordinate to the right of the top-left cell increasing.\nUsing the number 3 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) as the first selected number\n1, 2, 3\n2, 3, 3\n1, 4, 2\n\nReturn your answer with the format <<<list of selected number positions>>>, where each position is given as row column (0-based indices). For example, <<<0 3, 1 0, 2 4>>> means numbers selected are at positions (0,3), (1,0), and (2,4).",

    "To solve this problem, we need to select 4 different numbers from the given 3x3 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 3 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) is already selected.\n\nLet's break down the grid:\n\n```\n1, 2, 3\n2, 3, 3\n1, 4, 2\n```\n\nThe coordinates for each cell are as follows:\n\n```\n(0,0), (0,1), (0,2)\n(1,0), (1,1), (1,2)\n(2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n```\n\nWe have already selected the number 3 at position (0,2). Now, we need to select 3 more numbers such that:\n\n1. The sum of the selected numbers in each row is ≤ 4.\n2. The sum of the selected numbers in each column is ≤ 4.\n3. All selected numbers are different.\n\nLet's start by selecting the number 3 at (0,2) and then find the other numbers that satisfy the conditions.\n\n- From row 0, we have selected 3 at (0,2). We cannot select any more numbers from this row because the sum would exceed 4.\n- From row 1, we can select 2 at (1,0) because it is different from 3 and the sum in row 1 would be 2.\n- From row 2, we can select 1 at (2,0) because it is different from 3 and 2, and the sum in row 2 would be 1.\n\nNow, let's check the column constraints:\n\n- Column 0: We have selected 2 at (1,0) and 1 at (2,0). The sum is 3, which is ≤ 4.\n- Column 1: We have not selected any numbers from this column.\n- Column 2: We have selected 3 at (0,2). The sum is 3, which is ≤ 4.\n\nWe have selected 3 numbers so far: (0,2), (1,0), and (2,0). We need one more number.\n\n- From row 1, we can select 3 at (1,1) because it is different from 2 and 1, and the sum in row 1 would be 5, which exceeds 4. So, we cannot select this.\n- From row 2, we can select 2 at (2,2) because it is different from 1 and 3, and the sum in row 2 would be 3, which is ≤ 4.\n\nNow, let's check the column constraints again:\n\n- Column 0: We have selected 2 at (1,0) and 1 at (2,0). The sum is 3, which is ≤ 4.\n- Column 1: We have not selected any numbers from this column.\n- Column 2: We have selected 3 at (0,2) and 2 at (2,2). The sum is 5, which exceeds 4. So, we cannot select this.\n\nLet's try another combination:\n\n- From row 1, we can select 2 at (1,0) and 3 at (1,1). The sum in row 1 would be 5, which exceeds 4. So, we cannot select this.\n- From row 2, we can select 1 at (2,0) and 4 at (2,1). The sum in row 2 would be 5, which exceeds 4.
