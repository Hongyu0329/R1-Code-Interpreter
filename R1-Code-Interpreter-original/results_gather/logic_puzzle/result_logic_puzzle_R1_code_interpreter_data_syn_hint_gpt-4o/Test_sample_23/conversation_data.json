  "question": "Given a 3*3 grid where each cell contains a number (between 1 to 4), you must select 4 different numbers from these cells. The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column should be less than or equal to 4. The numbers in the same row are separated by ',', and the coordinate system uses the top-left cell as the coordinate (1,1), with the horizontal coordinate under the top-left cell increasing and the vertical coordinate to the right of the top-left cell increasing.\nUsing the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) as the first selected number\n3, 4, 2\n1, 3, 4\n4, 4, 3\n\nReturn your answer with the format <<<list of selected number positions>>>, where each position is given as row column (0-based indices). For example, <<<0 3, 1 0, 2 4>>> means numbers selected are at positions (0,3), (1,0), and (2,4).",

    "To solve this problem, we need to select four different numbers from the given 3x3 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) is already selected.\n\nLet's break down the grid:\n\n```\n3, 4, 2\n1, 3, 4\n4, 4, 3\n```\n\nThe selected number 2 is at position (0,2).\n\nNow, we need to select three more numbers from the grid, ensuring that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and column is less than or equal to 4.\n\n1. **Row 0**: We have already selected 2. We cannot select any more numbers from this row because any additional number will exceed the sum of 4.\n\n2. **Row 1**: We can select 1 from position (1,0) because it is the only number that will not exceed the sum of 4 in this row.\n\n3. **Row 2**: We can select 3 from position (2,2) because it is the only number that will not exceed the sum of 4 in this row.\n\nNow, let's check the columns:\n\n- **Column 0**: We have selected 1 from position (1,0). We cannot select any more numbers from this column because any additional number will exceed the sum of 4.\n\n- **Column 1**: We have not selected any number from this column. We can select 3 from position (1,1) because it will not exceed the sum of 4 in this column.\n\n- **Column 2**: We have selected 2 from position (0,2) and 3 from position (2,2). The sum is 5, which exceeds 4. Therefore, we cannot select any more numbers from this column.\n\nThe selected numbers are at positions (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), and (2,2).\n\nLet's verify the solution:\n\n- **Row 0**: Sum = 2\n- **Row 1**: Sum = 1 + 3 = 4\n- **Row 2**: Sum = 3\n\n- **Column 0**: Sum = 1\n- **Column 1**: Sum = 3\n- **Column 2**: Sum = 2 + 3 = 5 (exceeds 4, but we cannot change the selection of 2 at (0,2))\n\nThe solution satisfies the condition for rows and columns except for column 2, which is unavoidable due to the initial selection constraint.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 2, 1 0, 1 1, 2 2>>>"
