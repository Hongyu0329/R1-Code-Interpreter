    "To solve this problem, we need to select three different numbers from the given 2x2 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) is already selected.\n\nThe grid is as follows:\n\n```\n3, 2\n1, 1\n```\n\nThe coordinates for each cell are:\n- (0,0): 3\n- (0,1): 2 (already selected)\n- (1,0): 1\n- (1,1): 1\n\nSince we have already selected the number 2 at position (0,1), we need to select two more numbers from the remaining cells: (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1).\n\nLet's consider the constraints:\n1. The sum of the selected numbers in each row should be ≤ 4.\n2. The sum of the selected numbers in each column should be ≤ 4.\n\nLet's evaluate the possible selections:\n\n- If we select the number at (0,0) which is 3, the sum of the first row would be 3 + 2 = 5, which exceeds the limit. So, we cannot select (0,0).\n\n- If we select the numbers at (1,0) and (1,1), both are 1. The sum of the second row would be 1 + 1 = 2, which is within the limit. The sum of the first column would be 3 + 1 = 4, which is within the limit. The sum of the second column would be 2 + 1 = 3, which is within the limit.\n\nThus, the valid selection is:\n- (0,1): 2 (already selected)\n- (1,0): 1\n- (1,1): 1\n\nThis selection satisfies all the constraints.\n\nTherefore, the positions of the selected numbers are:\n- (0,1)\n- (1,0)\n- (1,1)\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 1, 1 0, 1 1>>>"
