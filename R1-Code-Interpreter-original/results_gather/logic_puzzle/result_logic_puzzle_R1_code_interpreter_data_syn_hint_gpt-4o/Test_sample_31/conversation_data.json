  "question": "Given a 3*3 grid where each cell contains a number (between 1 to 4), you must select 4 different numbers from these cells. The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column should be less than or equal to 4. The numbers in the same row are separated by ',', and the coordinate system uses the top-left cell as the coordinate (1,1), with the horizontal coordinate under the top-left cell increasing and the vertical coordinate to the right of the top-left cell increasing.\nUsing the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) as the first selected number\n2, 1, 2\n3, 1, 3\n4, 2, 2\n\nReturn your answer with the format <<<list of selected number positions>>>, where each position is given as row column (0-based indices). For example, <<<0 3, 1 0, 2 4>>> means numbers selected are at positions (0,3), (1,0), and (2,4).",

    "To solve this problem, we need to select four different numbers from the given 3x3 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) is already selected.\n\nLet's break down the grid:\n\n```\nRow 0: 2, 1, 2\nRow 1: 3, 1, 3\nRow 2: 4, 2, 2\n```\n\nThe selected number at position (0,2) is 2. We need to select three more numbers from the grid, ensuring that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and column does not exceed 4.\n\n### Step-by-step Reasoning:\n\n1. **Select the first number (already given):**\n   - Position: (0,2) with value 2.\n\n2. **Select the second number:**\n   - We need to select a number from the remaining cells such that the sum in row 0 and column 2 does not exceed 4.\n   - Possible candidates: (0,0), (0,1), (1,2), (2,2).\n   - Select (0,1) with value 1. Now, row 0 sum = 3, column 2 sum = 3.\n\n3. **Select the third number:**\n   - We need to select a number from the remaining cells such that the sum in row 1 and column 2 does not exceed 4.\n   - Possible candidates: (1,0), (1,1), (2,2).\n   - Select (1,1) with value 1. Now, row 1 sum = 1, column 1 sum = 2.\n\n4. **Select the fourth number:**\n   - We need to select a number from the remaining cells such that the sum in row 2 and column 1 does not exceed 4.\n   - Possible candidates: (2,0), (2,1).\n   - Select (2,1) with value 2. Now, row 2 sum = 2, column 1 sum = 4.\n\nThe selected numbers are at positions (0,2), (0,1), (1,1), and (2,1).\n\nLet's verify the sums:\n- Row 0: 2 + 1 = 3\n- Row 1: 1\n- Row 2: 2\n- Column 0: 0\n- Column 1: 1 + 2 = 3\n- Column 2: 2\n\nAll sums are less than or equal to 4.\n\nTherefore, the selected positions are:\n\n<<<0 2, 0 1, 1 1, 2 1>>>"
