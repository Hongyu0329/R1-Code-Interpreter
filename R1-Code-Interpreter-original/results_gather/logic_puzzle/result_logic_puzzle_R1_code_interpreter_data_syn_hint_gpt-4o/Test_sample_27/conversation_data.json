    "To solve this problem, we need to select 4 different numbers from the given 3x3 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 3 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) is already selected.\n\nLet's break down the grid:\n\n```\n3, 4, 3\n3, 1, 2\n1, 2, 3\n```\n\nThe coordinates for each cell are as follows:\n\n```\n(0,0), (0,1), (0,2)\n(1,0), (1,1), (1,2)\n(2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n```\n\nWe have already selected the number at (0,2), which is 3. Now, we need to select 3 more numbers such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and column is less than or equal to 4.\n\nLet's consider the constraints:\n- The sum of selected numbers in each row and column should be â‰¤ 4.\n- We need to select 4 different numbers.\n\nSince we have already selected 3 at (0,2), we need to be careful with the selection of other numbers to ensure the sum constraint is satisfied.\n\nLet's try to find a combination that satisfies these conditions:\n\n1. Select (0,2) = 3 (already selected)\n2. Select (1,1) = 1\n3. Select (2,0) = 1\n4. Select (0,0) = 3\n\nNow, let's check the sums:\n\n- Row 0: 3 (at 0,2) + 3 (at 0,0) = 6 (This doesn't satisfy the condition)\n- Row 1: 1 (at 1,1) = 1\n- Row 2: 1 (at 2,0) = 1\n\n- Column 0: 3 (at 0,0) + 1 (at 2,0) = 4\n- Column 1: 1 (at 1,1) = 1\n- Column 2: 3 (at 0,2) = 3\n\nThe sum in Row 0 exceeds the limit, so this selection doesn't work. Let's try another combination:\n\n1. Select (0,2) = 3 (already selected)\n2. Select (1,0) = 3\n3. Select (2,0) = 1\n4. Select (0,1) = 4\n\nNow, let's check the sums:\n\n- Row 0: 3 (at 0,2) + 4 (at 0,1) = 7 (This doesn't satisfy the condition)\n- Row 1: 3 (at 1,0) = 3\n- Row 2: 1 (at 2,0) = 1\n\n- Column 0: 3 (at 1,0) + 1 (at 2,0) = 4\n- Column 1: 4 (at 0,1) = 4\n- Column 2: 3 (at 0,2) = 3\n\nThe sum in Row 0 exceeds the limit, so this selection doesn't work either.\n\nLet's try another combination:\n\n1. Select (0,2) = 3 (already selected)\n2. Select (1,1) = 1\n3. Select (2,0) = 1\n4. Select (0,0) = 3\n\nNow, let's check the sums:\n\n- Row 0: 3 (at 0,2) + 3 (at 0,0) = 6 (This doesn't satisfy the condition)\n- Row 1: 1 (at 1,1) = 1\n- Row 2: 1 (at 2,0) = 1\n\n- Column 0: 3 (at 0,0) + 1 (at 2,0) = 4\n- Column 1: 1 (at 1,1) = 1\n- Column 2: 3 (at 0,2) = 3\n\nThe sum in Row 0 exceeds the limit, so this selection doesn't work.\n\nLet's try another combination:\n\n1. Select (0,2) = 3 (already selected)\n2. Select (1,1) = 1\n3. Select (2,0) = 1\n4. Select (0,1) = 4\n\nNow, let's check the sums:\n\n- Row 0: 3 (at 0,2) + 4 (at 0,1) = 7 (This doesn't satisfy the condition)\n- Row 1: 1 (at 1,1) = 1\n- Row 2: 1 (at 2,0) = 1\n\n- Column 0: 1 (at 2,0) = 1\n- Column 1: 1 (at 1,1) + 4 (at 0,1) = 5 (This doesn't satisfy the condition)\n- Column 2: 3 (at 0,2) = 3\n\nThe sum in Row 0 and Column 1 exceeds the limit, so this selection doesn't work.\n\nLet's try another combination:\n\n1. Select (0,2) = 3 (already selected)\n2. Select (1,1) = 1\n3. Select (2,0) = 1\n4. Select (2,1) = 2\n\nNow, let's check the sums:\n\n- Row 0: 3 (at 0,2) = 3\n- Row 1: 1 (at 1,1) = 1\n- Row 2: 1 (at 2,0) + 2 (at 2,1) = 3\n\n- Column 0: 1 (at 2,0) = 1\n- Column 1: 1 (at 1,1) + 2 (at 2,1) = 3\n- Column 2: 3 (at 0,2) = 3\n\nThis selection satisfies all the conditions. Therefore, the selected positions are:\n\n- (0,2)\n- (1,1)\n- (2,0)\n- (2,1)\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 2, 1 1, 2 0, 2 1>>>"
