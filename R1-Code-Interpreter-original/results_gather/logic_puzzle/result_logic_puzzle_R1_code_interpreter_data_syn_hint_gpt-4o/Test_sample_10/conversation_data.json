    "To solve this problem, we need to select three different numbers from the given 2x2 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) is already selected.\n\nThe grid is as follows:\n\n```\n1, 2\n3, 1\n```\n\nThe coordinates for each cell are:\n- (0,0): 1\n- (0,1): 2\n- (1,0): 3\n- (1,1): 1\n\nWe have already selected the number 2 at position (0,1). Now, we need to select two more numbers from the remaining cells: (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1).\n\nLet's analyze the constraints:\n1. The sum of the selected numbers in each row should be ≤ 4.\n2. The sum of the selected numbers in each column should be ≤ 4.\n\nSince we have already selected the number 2 at (0,1), we need to choose two more numbers such that these constraints are satisfied.\n\nLet's consider the possible selections:\n\n- If we select the number at (0,0) which is 1, the sum for row 0 becomes 1 + 2 = 3, which is valid.\n- If we select the number at (1,0) which is 3, the sum for column 0 becomes 1 + 3 = 4, which is valid.\n- If we select the number at (1,1) which is 1, the sum for row 1 becomes 3 + 1 = 4, which is valid.\n\nNow, let's check the possible combinations:\n\n1. Select (0,0) and (1,0):\n   - Row 0: 1 + 2 = 3\n   - Row 1: 3\n   - Column 0: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Column 1: 2\n\n2. Select (0,0) and (1,1):\n   - Row 0: 1 + 2 = 3\n   - Row 1: 1\n   - Column 0: 1\n   - Column 1: 2 + 1 = 3\n\n3. Select (1,0) and (1,1):\n   - Row 0: 2\n   - Row 1: 3 + 1 = 4\n   - Column 0: 3\n   - Column 1: 2 + 1 = 3\n\nAll combinations satisfy the constraints, but we need to select three different numbers. The combination (0,0), (1,0) with (0,1) already selected gives us the numbers 1, 2, and 3, which are all different.\n\nTherefore, the selected positions are (0,1), (0,0), and (1,0).\n\n<<<0 1, 0 0, 1 0>>>"
