    "To solve this problem, we need to select 10 different numbers from the given 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number -9 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial Selection**: We start with the number -9 at position (0,4).\n\n2. **Constraints**: \n   - We need to select 10 different numbers.\n   - The product of selected numbers in each row and column must be greater than 0. This implies that each row and column must have an even number of negative numbers or no negative numbers at all.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - We will try to select numbers such that the product condition is satisfied.\n   - We will ensure that each row and column has an even number of negative numbers or no negative numbers.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - We will iterate over the grid and select numbers while keeping track of the count of negative numbers in each row and column.\n   - We will ensure that the total number of selected numbers is 10.\n\nLet's implement this strategy using Python code to find the positions of the selected numbers.\n\n```python\ngrid = [\n    [-1, 2, -3, 8, -9],\n    [2, -8, -5, 1, -3],\n    [-10, 6, 1, 1, 10],\n    [-2, -2, 6, 9, -6],\n    [-3, -10, 2, 6, -9]\n]\n\nselected_positions = [(0, 4)]\nselected_numbers = [-9]\n\n# We need to select 9 more numbers\nfor i in range(5):\n    for j in range(5):\n        if len(selected_positions) == 10:\n            break\n        if (i, j) not in selected_positions:\n            # Check if adding this number keeps the product of each row and column positive\n            row_neg_count = sum(1 for x in range(5) if (i, x) in selected_positions and grid[i][x] < 0)\n            col_neg_count = sum(1 for x in range(5) if (x, j) in selected_positions and grid[x][j] < 0)\n            \n            if grid[i][j] < 0:\n                row_neg_count += 1\n                col_neg_count += 1\n            \n            if row_neg_count % 2 == 0 and col_neg_count % 2 == 0:\n                selected_positions.append((i, j))\n                selected_numbers.append(grid[i][j])\n\n# Output the selected positions\nprint(selected_positions)\n```\n\nThis code will select 10 numbers from the grid while ensuring that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is positive. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code execution result shows that we have selected 10 positions, but we need to ensure that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. Let's analyze the result and improve the selection process.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Product Condition**: For the product of numbers in each row and column to be positive, the number of negative numbers in each row and column must be even or zero.\n\n2. **Current Selection**: The current selection might not satisfy the product condition for all rows and columns. We need to verify and adjust the selection to meet the criteria.\n\n### Improved Strategy:\n- We need to carefully select numbers such that each row and column has an even number of negative numbers.\n- We can use a backtracking approach to explore different combinations and ensure the product condition is met.\n\n### Implementation:\nLet's implement a backtracking approach to find a valid selection of 10 numbers.\n\n```python\ndef is_valid_selection(selected_positions, grid):\n    # Check if the product condition is satisfied for each row and column\n    for i in range(5):\n        row_neg_count = sum(1 for j in range(5) if (i, j) in selected_positions and grid[i][j] < 0)\n        if row_neg_count % 2 != 0:\n            return False\n    for j in range(5):\n        col_neg_count = sum(1 for i in range(5) if (i, j) in selected_positions and grid[i][j] < 0)\n        if col_neg_count % 2 != 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef find_selection(grid):\n    selected_positions = [(0, 4)]\n    selected_numbers = [-9]\n\n    def backtrack():\n        if len(selected_positions) == 10:\n            if is_valid_selection(selected_positions, grid):\n                return True\n            return False\n\n        for i in range(5):\n            for j in range(5):\n                if (i, j) not in selected_positions:\n                    selected_positions.append((i, j))\n                    selected_numbers.append(grid[i][j])\n                    if backtrack():\n                        return True\n                    selected_positions.pop()\n                    selected_numbers.pop()\n        return False\n\n    backtrack()\n    return selected_positions\n\ngrid = [\n    [-1, 2, -3, 8, -9],\n    [2, -8, -5, 1, -3],\n    [-10, 6, 1, 1, 10],\n    [-2, -2, 6, 9, -6],\n    [-3, -10, 2, 6, -9]\n]\n\nselected_positions = find_selection(grid)\nprint(selected_positions)\n```\n\nThis code uses a backtracking approach to find a valid selection of 10 numbers that satisfy the product condition for each row and column. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The previous approach using backtracking might have been too slow or inefficient, leading to a timeout. Let's reconsider the problem and try a more efficient strategy.\n\n### Problem Restatement:\nWe need to select 10 different numbers from a 5x5 grid such that:\n- The product of selected numbers in each row and column is greater than 0.\n- We start with the number -9 at position (0,4).\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Product Condition**: For the product to be positive, each row and column must have an even number of negative numbers or no negative numbers at all.\n2. **Initial Selection**: We have already selected -9 at (0,4), which is a negative number. We need to balance this with other selections.\n\n### Strategy:\n- We will use a greedy approach to select numbers, ensuring that each row and column maintains an even count of negative numbers.\n- We will prioritize selecting positive numbers to avoid complicating the balance of negatives.\n\n### Implementation:\nLet's implement a more efficient greedy approach to solve the problem.\n\n```python\ngrid = [\n    [-1, 2, -3, 8, -9],\n    [2, -8, -5, 1, -3],\n    [-10, 6, 1, 1, 10],\n    [-2, -2, 6, 9, -6],\n    [-3, -10, 2, 6, -9]\n]\n\nselected_positions = [(0, 4)]\nselected_numbers = [-9]\n\n# Track negative counts in rows and columns\nrow_neg_count = [0] * 5\ncol_neg_count = [0] * 5\nrow_neg_count[0] += 1\ncol_neg_count[4] += 1\n\n# Function to check if adding a number keeps the product condition valid\ndef can_add(i, j):\n    temp_row_neg = row_neg_count[i]\n    temp_col_neg = col_neg_count[j]\n    if grid[i][j] < 0:\n        temp_row_neg += 1\n        temp_col_neg += 1\n    return temp_row_neg % 2 == 0 and temp_col_neg % 2 == 0\n\n# Greedily select numbers\nfor i in range(5):\n    for j in range(5):\n        if len(selected_positions) == 10:\n            break\n        if (i, j) not in selected_positions and can_add(i, j):\n            selected_positions.append((i, j))\n            selected_numbers.append(grid[i][j])\n            if grid[i][j] < 0:\n                row_neg_count[i] += 1\n                col_neg_count[j] += 1\n\nprint(selected_positions)\n```\n\nThis code attempts to select numbers while maintaining the product condition using a greedy approach. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The previous attempts have not successfully ensured that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is positive. Let's take a step back and analyze the problem more thoroughly.\n\n### Problem Analysis:\n1. **Initial Selection**: We start with the number -9 at position (0,4), which is a negative number.\n2. **Product Condition**: For the product of numbers in each row and column to be positive, the number of negative numbers in each row and column must be even or zero.\n3. **Selection Strategy**: We need to select numbers such that each row and column has an even number of negative numbers.\n\n### Improved Strategy:\n- We will use a combination of reasoning and a systematic approach to ensure that the selection meets the criteria.\n- We will manually select numbers to ensure that each row and column has an even number of negative numbers.\n\n### Manual Selection:\nLet's manually select numbers to satisfy the conditions:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Start with -9 at (0,4). We need another negative number to balance it. Select -3 at (0,2).\n2. **Row 1**: Select 2 at (1,0) and 1 at (1,3) to avoid adding more negatives.\n3. **Row 2**: Select 6 at (2,1), 1 at (2,2), and 1 at (2,3) to keep the row positive.\n4. **Row 3**: Select 6 at (3,2) and 9 at (3,3) to keep the row positive.\n5. **Row 4**: Select 2 at (4,2) and 6 at (4,3) to keep the row positive.\n\n### Final Selection:\n- (0,4), (0,2)\n- (1,0), (1,3)\n- (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)\n- (3,2), (3,3)\n- (4,2), (4,3)\n\nThis selection ensures that each row and column has an even number of negative numbers, satisfying the product condition.\n\n<<<'0 4, 0 2, 1 0, 1 3, 2 1, 2 2, 2 3, 3 2, 3 3, 4 2'>>>"
