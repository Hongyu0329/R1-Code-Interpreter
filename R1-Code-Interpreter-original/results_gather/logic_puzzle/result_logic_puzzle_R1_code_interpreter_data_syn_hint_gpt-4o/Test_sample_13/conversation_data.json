    "To solve this problem, we need to select three different numbers from the given 2x2 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 3 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) is already selected.\n\nLet's break down the grid and the constraints:\n\nGrid:\n```\n(0,0) 2, (0,1) 3\n(1,0) 1, (1,1) 1\n```\n\nSelected number: 3 at position (0,1).\n\nConstraints:\n- We need to select two more numbers from the grid.\n- The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column should be ≤ 4.\n\nLet's analyze the possible selections:\n\n1. We have already selected the number 3 at position (0,1).\n2. We need to select two more numbers from the remaining positions: (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1).\n\nLet's consider the possible selections:\n\n- If we select the number at (0,0) which is 2, the sum of the first row becomes 2 + 3 = 5, which violates the constraint.\n- If we select the number at (1,0) which is 1, the sum of the first column becomes 3 + 1 = 4, which satisfies the constraint.\n- If we select the number at (1,1) which is 1, the sum of the second row becomes 1 + 1 = 2, which satisfies the constraint.\n\nTherefore, the valid selection is:\n- Select the number at (1,0) which is 1.\n- Select the number at (1,1) which is 1.\n\nNow, let's verify the constraints:\n- Row 0: 3 (at 0,1) + 0 (no other selection) = 3 ≤ 4\n- Row 1: 1 (at 1,0) + 1 (at 1,1) = 2 ≤ 4\n- Column 0: 0 (no selection) + 1 (at 1,0) = 1 ≤ 4\n- Column 1: 3 (at 0,1) + 1 (at 1,1) = 4 ≤ 4\n\nAll constraints are satisfied.\n\nThus, the selected positions are (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1).\n\n<<<0 1, 1 0, 1 1>>>"
