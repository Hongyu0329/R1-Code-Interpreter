    "To solve this problem, we need to select three different numbers from the given 2x2 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 1 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) is already selected.\n\nThe grid is as follows:\n\n```\n3, 1\n2, 3\n```\n\nThe coordinates for each cell are:\n- (0,0): 3\n- (0,1): 1\n- (1,0): 2\n- (1,1): 3\n\nWe have already selected the number at (0,1), which is 1. Now, we need to select two more numbers from the remaining cells: (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1).\n\nLet's consider the constraints:\n1. The sum of the selected numbers in each row should be ≤ 4.\n2. The sum of the selected numbers in each column should be ≤ 4.\n\nSince we have already selected 1 at (0,1), we need to choose two more numbers such that these constraints are satisfied.\n\nLet's evaluate the possible selections:\n\n- If we select (0,0) and (1,0):\n  - Row 0 sum: 3 + 1 = 4 (satisfies the constraint)\n  - Row 1 sum: 2 (satisfies the constraint)\n  - Column 0 sum: 3 + 2 = 5 (does not satisfy the constraint)\n  - Column 1 sum: 1 (satisfies the constraint)\n\n- If we select (0,0) and (1,1):\n  - Row 0 sum: 3 + 1 = 4 (satisfies the constraint)\n  - Row 1 sum: 3 (satisfies the constraint)\n  - Column 0 sum: 3 (satisfies the constraint)\n  - Column 1 sum: 1 + 3 = 4 (satisfies the constraint)\n\n- If we select (1,0) and (1,1):\n  - Row 0 sum: 1 (satisfies the constraint)\n  - Row 1 sum: 2 + 3 = 5 (does not satisfy the constraint)\n  - Column 0 sum: 2 (satisfies the constraint)\n  - Column 1 sum: 1 + 3 = 4 (satisfies the constraint)\n\nThe only valid selection that satisfies all constraints is selecting (0,0) and (1,1) along with the already selected (0,1).\n\nThus, the selected positions are (0,1), (0,0), and (1,1).\n\n<<<0 1, 0 0, 1 1>>>"
