    "To solve this problem, we need to select 12 different numbers from the given 6x6 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 3 in the top-rightmost square (0,5) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Understanding the Grid**: We have a 6x6 grid with numbers ranging from -12 to 12. We need to select 12 numbers such that the product of numbers in each row and column is positive.\n\n2. **Constraints**: \n   - The product of numbers in each row and column must be positive.\n   - We must select exactly 12 numbers.\n   - The number at position (0,5) is already selected.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - We need to ensure that the product of numbers in each row and column is positive. This means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n   - We can start by selecting the number at (0,5) and then carefully choose other numbers to satisfy the constraints.\n\n4. **Approach**:\n   - Start with the given number at (0,5).\n   - Select numbers from each row and column ensuring an even number of negative numbers.\n   - Check the product condition for each row and column.\n\nLet's implement this strategy using Python code to find a valid selection of numbers.\n\n```python\ngrid = [\n    [8, -2, 7, 6, -4, 3],\n    [11, -11, 7, 11, -8, 8],\n    [-4, -6, 10, -6, 4, -12],\n    [3, 10, 1, 9, -1, -4],\n    [4, 7, 12, -10, 7, 11],\n    [8, 7, 9, -11, 3, 7]\n]\n\n# Start with the given number at (0,5)\nselected_positions = [(0, 5)]\n\n# Function to check if the product of selected numbers in a row or column is positive\ndef is_product_positive(selected_positions, grid):\n    row_products = [1] * 6\n    col_products = [1] * 6\n    for r, c in selected_positions:\n        row_products[r] *= grid[r][c]\n        col_products[c] *= grid[r][c]\n    return all(p > 0 for p in row_products) and all(p > 0 for p in col_products)\n\n# Try to select 12 numbers\ndef select_numbers(grid, selected_positions):\n    for r in range(6):\n        for c in range(6):\n            if (r, c) not in selected_positions:\n                selected_positions.append((r, c))\n                if len(selected_positions) == 12 and is_product_positive(selected_positions, grid):\n                    return selected_positions\n                elif len(selected_positions) < 12:\n                    result = select_numbers(grid, selected_positions)\n                    if result:\n                        return result\n                selected_positions.pop()\n    return None\n\n# Find the solution\nsolution = select_numbers(grid, selected_positions)\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code attempts to find a valid selection of 12 numbers from the grid that satisfies the given conditions.
