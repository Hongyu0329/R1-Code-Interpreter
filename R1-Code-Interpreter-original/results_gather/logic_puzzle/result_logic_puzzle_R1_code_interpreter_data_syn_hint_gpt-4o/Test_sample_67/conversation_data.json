    "To solve this problem, we need to select 10 different numbers from the given 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**: We have a 5x5 grid with numbers ranging from -7 to 10. We need to select 10 numbers such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is positive.\n\n2. **Constraints**: \n   - We must include the number at position (0,4).\n   - The product of selected numbers in each row and column must be positive. This implies that each row and column with selected numbers must have an even number of negative numbers or no negative numbers at all.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Start by including the given number at (0,4).\n   - Select numbers from each row and column ensuring the product condition is met.\n   - We need to ensure that the total number of selected numbers is 10.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - We will iterate over the grid and select numbers while checking the product condition.\n   - We will use a greedy approach to select numbers that help in maintaining the product condition.\n\nLet's implement this strategy in code to find the positions of the selected numbers.\n\n```python\n# Given grid\ngrid = [\n    [4, 7, -7, 6, 2],\n    [-6, -3, 3, 10, 2],\n    [9, 4, 10, 5, 4],\n    [-4, 4, 8, 5, 7],\n    [8, 1, 10, -2, 10]\n]\n\n# Start with the given number at (0,4)\nselected_positions = [(0, 4)]\n\n# Function to check if the product of selected numbers in a row or column is positive\ndef is_product_positive(selected_positions, grid):\n    row_products = [1] * 5\n    col_products = [1] * 5\n    for r, c in selected_positions:\n        row_products[r] *= grid[r][c]\n        col_products[c] *= grid[r][c]\n    return all(p > 0 for p in row_products if p != 1) and all(p > 0 for p in col_products if p != 1)\n\n# Select numbers ensuring the product condition\nfor r in range(5):\n    for c in range(5):\n        if (r, c) not in selected_positions:\n            selected_positions.append((r, c))\n            if len(selected_positions) == 10:\n                if is_product_positive(selected_positions, grid):\n                    break\n                else:\n                    selected_positions.pop()\n            elif not is_product_positive(selected_positions, grid):\n                selected_positions.pop()\n    if len(selected_positions) == 10:\n        break\n\n# Output the selected positions\nprint(selected_positions)\n```\n\nThis code will select 10 numbers from the grid while ensuring the product condition is met.
