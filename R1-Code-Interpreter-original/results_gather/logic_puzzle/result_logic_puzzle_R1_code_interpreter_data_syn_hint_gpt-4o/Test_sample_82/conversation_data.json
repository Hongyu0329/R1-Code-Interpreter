    "To solve this problem, we need to select 12 different numbers from the 6x6 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 11 in the top-rightmost square (0,5) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**: We have a 6x6 grid with numbers ranging from -12 to 12. We need to select 12 numbers such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is positive.\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - We must select exactly 12 numbers.\n   - The product of selected numbers in each row and column must be positive.\n   - The number 11 at position (0,5) is already selected.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Since the product must be positive, we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n   - We can start by selecting numbers that are positive or zero to ensure the product remains positive.\n   - We need to carefully select negative numbers to ensure an even count in each row and column.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - We will iterate through the grid and select numbers while keeping track of the count of selected numbers in each row and column.\n   - We will ensure that the product condition is satisfied by maintaining an even count of negative numbers in each row and column.\n\nLet's implement this strategy in code to find the solution.\n\n```python\ngrid = [\n    [9, 5, 1, 12, -2, 11],\n    [-5, 6, 6, 11, 10, 8],\n    [8, -1, -6, 1, -8, 5],\n    [1, 12, 11, 10, -9, 12],\n    [3, 3, -12, -4, 5, 12],\n    [-1, -10, -3, -2, 4, 12]\n]\n\n# Start with the given number\nselected_positions = [(0, 5)]\nselected_numbers = [11]\n\n# Function to check if adding a number keeps the product positive\ndef is_valid_selection(row_counts, col_counts, row, col, num):\n    if num < 0:\n        row_counts[row] += 1\n        col_counts[col] += 1\n    valid = (row_counts[row] % 2 == 0) and (col_counts[col] % 2 == 0)\n    if num < 0:\n        row_counts[row] -= 1\n        col_counts[col] -= 1\n    return valid\n\n# Initialize row and column negative counts\nrow_counts = [0] * 6\ncol_counts = [0] * 6\n\n# Mark the initial selection\nrow_counts[0] += 0\ncol_counts[5] += 0\n\n# Select numbers\nfor r in range(6):\n    for c in range(6):\n        if len(selected_positions) == 12:\n            break\n        if (r, c) not in selected_positions:\n            num = grid[r][c]\n            if num > 0 or is_valid_selection(row_counts, col_counts, r, c, num):\n                selected_positions.append((r, c))\n                selected_numbers.append(num)\n                if num < 0:\n                    row_counts[r] += 1\n                    col_counts[c] += 1\n\n# Output the selected positions\nprint(', '.join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in selected_positions))\n```\n\nThis code will select 12 numbers from the grid while ensuring the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is positive.
