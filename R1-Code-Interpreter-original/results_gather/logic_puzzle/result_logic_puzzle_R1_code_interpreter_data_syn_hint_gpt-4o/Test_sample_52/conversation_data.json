    "To solve this problem, we need to select 9 different numbers from the given 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Constraints**: \n   - We need to select 9 numbers.\n   - The product of numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers must be greater than 0.\n   - We must include the number at position (0,4).\n\n2. **Grid Analysis**:\n   - The grid is:\n     ```\n     1, -4, -1, 5, 2\n     -7, -6, 7, 4, 2\n     -2, -5, 4, -1, 6\n     -3, -4, -7, 4, 4\n     1, -7, 6, 5, 6\n     ```\n   - We need to ensure that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive. This means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Start with the given number at (0,4).\n   - Select numbers such that each row and column of the selected numbers has an even number of negative numbers.\n   - Ensure that the total count of selected numbers is 9.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - We will use a combination of reasoning and code to find a valid selection of numbers.\n\nLet's proceed with the implementation to find a valid selection of numbers.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [1, -4, -1, 5, 2],\n    [-7, -6, 7, 4, 2],\n    [-2, -5, 4, -1, 6],\n    [-3, -4, -7, 4, 4],\n    [1, -7, 6, 5, 6]\n]\n\n# Start with the given number at (0,4)\nselected_positions = [(0, 4)]\n\n# Function to check if the product of numbers in each row and column is positive\ndef is_valid_selection(positions):\n    row_products = [1] * 5\n    col_products = [1] * 5\n    for r, c in positions:\n        row_products[r] *= grid[r][c]\n        col_products[c] *= grid[r][c]\n    return all(p > 0 for p in row_products if p != 1) and all(p > 0 for p in col_products if p != 1)\n\n# Try to find a valid selection of 9 numbers\nfor positions in itertools.combinations([(r, c) for r in range(5) for c in range(5) if (r, c) != (0, 4)], 8):\n    positions = selected_positions + list(positions)\n    if is_valid_selection(positions):\n        print(positions)\n        break\n```\n\nThe code will attempt to find a valid selection of 9 numbers, including the given number at (0,4), such that the product of numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers is positive. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code execution result indicates that a valid selection of numbers was found, but we need to verify if this selection indeed satisfies the condition that the product of numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers is positive. Let's analyze the result:\n\n1. **Selected Positions**: \n   - [(0, 4), (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 1), (3, 0), (3, 2)]\n\n2. **Verification**:\n   - We need to check if the product of numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers is positive.\n\n3. **Analysis**:\n   - Row 0: 1, -4, -1, 5, 2 (Product: 1 * -4 * -1 * 5 * 2 = 40, Positive)\n   - Row 1: -7, -6 (Product: -7 * -6 = 42, Positive)\n   - Row 3: -3, -7 (Product: -3 * -7 = 21, Positive)\n   - Column 0: 1, -7, -3 (Product: 1 * -7 * -3 = 21, Positive)\n   - Column 1: -4, -6 (Product: -4 * -6 = 24, Positive)\n   - Column 2: -1, -7 (Product: -1 * -7 = 7, Positive)\n   - Column 3: 5 (Product: 5, Positive)\n   - Column 4: 2 (Product: 2, Positive)\n\nThe selected numbers satisfy the condition that the product of numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers is positive. Therefore, the solution is valid.\n\nLet's provide the final answer in the required format.\n\n<<<0 4, 0 0, 0 1, 0 2, 0 3, 1 0, 1 1, 3 0, 3 2>>>"
