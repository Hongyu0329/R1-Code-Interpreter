    "To solve this problem, we need to select 10 different numbers from the given 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 5 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial Selection**: We start with the number at position (0,4), which is 5.\n\n2. **Constraints**: \n   - We need to select 10 numbers in total.\n   - The product of numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers must be greater than 0. This means that each row and column must have an even number of negative numbers or no negative numbers at all.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - We will try to select numbers such that the product condition is satisfied.\n   - We will ensure that the selection includes a mix of positive and negative numbers such that the product in each row and column remains positive.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - We will iterate over the grid and select numbers while keeping track of the number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n   - We will ensure that the total number of selected numbers is 10.\n\nLet's implement this strategy using Python code to find a valid selection of numbers.\n\n```python\ngrid = [\n    [9, 7, 4, 5, 5],\n    [-7, 4, -3, -4, 5],\n    [7, 1, 3, 2, 8],\n    [4, 9, 2, 1, 6],\n    [-4, 6, -9, 7, 3]\n]\n\n# Start with the given number\nselected_positions = [(0, 4)]\nselected_numbers = [grid[0][4]]\n\n# Function to check if the current selection is valid\ndef is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n    row_count = [0] * 5\n    col_count = [0] * 5\n    for r, c in selected_positions:\n        if grid[r][c] < 0:\n            row_count[r] += 1\n            col_count[c] += 1\n    # Check if each row and column has an even number of negative numbers\n    for count in row_count + col_count:\n        if count % 2 != 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Try to select 10 numbers\nfor r in range(5):\n    for c in range(5):\n        if (r, c) not in selected_positions:\n            selected_positions.append((r, c))\n            selected_numbers.append(grid[r][c])\n            if len(selected_positions) == 10:\n                if is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n                    break\n                else:\n                    selected_positions.pop()\n                    selected_numbers.pop()\n    if len(selected_positions) == 10 and is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n        break\n\n# Output the selected positions\nprint(selected_positions)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to select 10 numbers from the grid while ensuring that the product of numbers in each row and column is positive.
