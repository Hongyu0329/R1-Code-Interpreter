    "To solve this problem, we need to select 6 different numbers from the given 4x4 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 8 in the top-rightmost square (0,3) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**: \n   - The grid is:\n     ```\n     1, 3, -3, 8\n     8, 7, 8, -3\n     2, 2, -4, -1\n     8, 2, 2, 4\n     ```\n   - We need to select 6 numbers, including the number at (0,3).\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - The product of selected numbers in each row and column must be greater than 0.\n   - This implies that for each row and column, the number of negative numbers selected must be even (including zero).\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Start with the number at (0,3) which is 8.\n   - Select numbers such that the product of numbers in each row and column is positive.\n   - Ensure that the total number of selected numbers is 6.\n\n4. **Selection**:\n   - We need to carefully choose numbers to satisfy the constraints. \n   - We can start by selecting numbers that are positive or zero to ensure the product remains positive.\n\nLet's try to find a valid selection:\n\n- Start with (0,3) = 8.\n- Select (1,0) = 8, (1,2) = 8, (3,0) = 8, (3,3) = 4, and (2,0) = 2.\n\nNow, let's verify:\n\n- **Row 0**: (0,3) = 8\n- **Row 1**: (1,0) = 8, (1,2) = 8\n- **Row 2**: (2,0) = 2\n- **Row 3**: (3,0) = 8, (3,3) = 4\n\n- **Column 0**: (1,0) = 8, (2,0) = 2, (3,0) = 8\n- **Column 2**: (1,2) = 8\n- **Column 3**: (0,3) = 8, (3,3) = 4\n\nAll selected numbers are positive, ensuring the product of each row and column is positive.\n\nThus, the selected positions are:\n- (0,3), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (3,0), (3,3)\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 3, 1 0, 1 2, 2 0, 3 0, 3 3>>>"
