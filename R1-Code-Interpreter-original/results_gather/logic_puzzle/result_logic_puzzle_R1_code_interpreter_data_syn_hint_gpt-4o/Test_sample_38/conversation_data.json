    "To solve this problem, we need to select 6 different numbers from the given 4x4 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number at position (0,3) is already selected, which is -1.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**: \n   - The grid is:\n     ```\n     3, -4, 3, -1\n     8, -4, -2, 1\n     7, 4, -4, 2\n     5, 4, 5, 3\n     ```\n   - We need to select 6 numbers, including the number at (0,3).\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - The product of selected numbers in each row and column must be greater than 0.\n   - This implies that the product must be positive, which can be achieved by selecting an even number of negative numbers or all positive numbers in each row and column.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Since we have already selected a negative number (-1) at (0,3), we need to ensure that the product of the selected numbers in the first row and the fourth column is positive.\n   - We need to select 5 more numbers such that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive.\n\n4. **Selection**:\n   - We will start by selecting numbers that are positive or ensure an even number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n\nLet's try to find a valid selection:\n\n- **Row 0**: We have -1 at (0,3). We can select 3 at (0,0) and 3 at (0,2) to make the product positive.\n- **Row 1**: Select 8 at (1,0) and 1 at (1,3) to make the product positive.\n- **Row 2**: Select 4 at (2,1) and 2 at (2,3) to make the product positive.\n- **Row 3**: Select 5 at (3,0) and 3 at (3,3) to make the product positive.\n\nNow, let's check the columns:\n\n- **Column 0**: We have 3 at (0,0), 8 at (1,0), and 5 at (3,0). The product is positive.\n- **Column 1**: We have 4 at (2,1). We need to ensure the product is positive, but since we have only one number, it doesn't affect the overall selection.\n- **Column 2**: We have 3 at (0,2). We need to ensure the product is positive, but since we have only one number, it doesn't affect the overall selection.\n- **Column 3**: We have -1 at (0,3), 1 at (1,3), 2 at (2,3), and 3 at (3,3). The product is positive.\n\nThe selected positions are:\n- (0,0), (0,2), (0,3)\n- (1,0), (1,3)\n- (2,1), (2,3)\n- (3,0), (3,3)\n\nHowever, we need to select exactly 6 numbers. Let's adjust the selection to meet the criteria:\n\n- Select (0,3), (0,0), (1,0), (1,3), (2,1), (3,0)\n\nThis selection ensures that the product of each row and column is positive.\n\nFinal answer:\n<<<0 3, 0 0, 1 0, 1 3, 2 1, 3 0>>>"
