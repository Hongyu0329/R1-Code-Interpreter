The product of each row and column of the selected number must be greater than 0.

    "To solve this problem, we need to select 6 different numbers from the given 4x4 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 7 at position (0,3) is already selected.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial Selection**: We have already selected the number 7 at position (0,3).\n\n2. **Constraints**: \n   - We need to select 5 more numbers.\n   - The product of numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers must be greater than 0.\n   - This implies that each row and column with selected numbers must have an even number of negative numbers or no negative numbers at all.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Start with the given number 7 at (0,3).\n   - Select numbers such that the product of numbers in each row and column remains positive.\n   - Ensure that the selection covers different rows and columns to meet the requirement of 6 different numbers.\n\n4. **Grid Analysis**:\n   - Row 0: -3, 8, 8, 7\n   - Row 1: 2, -3, 5, 3\n   - Row 2: 5, 4, 6, 5\n   - Row 3: 6, -5, 5, 1\n\n5. **Selection Process**:\n   - We need to ensure that the selected numbers in each row and column have an even number of negative numbers or no negative numbers.\n   - We will start by selecting numbers that are positive to avoid negative products.\n\nLet's proceed with the selection:\n\n- From Row 0, we already have 7 at (0,3).\n- From Row 1, select 2 at (1,0) and 5 at (1,2).\n- From Row 2, select 5 at (2,0) and 6 at (2,2).\n- From Row 3, select 6 at (3,0).\n\nNow, let's verify the selection:\n\n- Row 0: 7 (positive)\n- Row 1: 2, 5 (positive)\n- Row 2: 5, 6 (positive)\n- Row 3: 6 (positive)\n\n- Column 0: 5, 6 (positive)\n- Column 2: 5, 6 (positive)\n- Column 3: 7 (positive)\n\nAll selected numbers in each row and column have a positive product.\n\nThus, the selected positions are:\n- (0,3), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,0)\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 3, 1 0, 1 2, 2 0, 2 2, 3 0>>>"
