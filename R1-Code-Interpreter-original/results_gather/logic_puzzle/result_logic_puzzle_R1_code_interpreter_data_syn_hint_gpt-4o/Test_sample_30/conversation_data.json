The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column should be less than or equal to 4.

    "To solve this problem, we need to select 4 different numbers from the given 3x3 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 4 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) is already selected.\n\nLet's break down the grid:\n\n```\n1, 4, 4\n2, 1, 4\n2, 3, 3\n```\n\nThe coordinates for each cell are as follows:\n\n- (0,0): 1\n- (0,1): 4\n- (0,2): 4 (selected)\n- (1,0): 2\n- (1,1): 1\n- (1,2): 4\n- (2,0): 2\n- (2,1): 3\n- (2,2): 3\n\nWe need to select 3 more numbers such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and column is less than or equal to 4. The number 4 is already selected at (0,2).\n\nLet's consider the constraints:\n\n1. Row 0: We have already selected 4 at (0,2). We cannot select any more numbers from this row because the sum would exceed 4.\n2. Row 1: We can select numbers such that their sum is less than or equal to 4.\n3. Row 2: We can select numbers such that their sum is less than or equal to 4.\n\nSimilarly, for columns:\n\n1. Column 0: We can select numbers such that their sum is less than or equal to 4.\n2. Column 1: We can select numbers such that their sum is less than or equal to 4.\n3. Column 2: We have already selected 4 at (0,2). We cannot select any more numbers from this column because the sum would exceed 4.\n\nNow, let's try to find a valid selection of numbers:\n\n- From Row 1, we can select (1,1) which is 1.\n- From Row 2, we can select (2,0) which is 2.\n- From Row 2, we can select (2,1) which is 3.\n\nLet's check if this selection satisfies the constraints:\n\n- Row 0: Sum = 4 (valid)\n- Row 1: Sum = 1 (valid)\n- Row 2: Sum = 2 + 3 = 5 (invalid, exceeds 4)\n\nLet's try another combination:\n\n- From Row 1, we can select (1,0) which is 2.\n- From Row 2, we can select (2,0) which is 2.\n\nLet's check if this selection satisfies the constraints:\n\n- Row 0: Sum = 4 (valid)\n- Row 1: Sum = 2 (valid)\n- Row 2: Sum = 2 (valid)\n\n- Column 0: Sum = 2 + 2 = 4 (valid)\n- Column 1: Sum = 0 (valid)\n- Column 2: Sum = 4 (valid)\n\nThis selection satisfies all the constraints. Therefore, the selected positions are:\n\n- (0,2)\n- (1,0)\n- (2,0)\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 2, 1 0, 2 0>>>"
