    "To solve this problem, we need to select 12 different numbers from the 6x6 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 5 in the top-rightmost square (0,5) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Understanding the Grid**: We have a 6x6 grid with numbers ranging from -9 to 12. We need to select 12 numbers such that the product of numbers in each row and column is positive.\n\n2. **Constraints**: \n   - We must select 12 different numbers.\n   - The product of selected numbers in each row and column must be positive.\n   - The number at position (0,5) is already selected.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Since the product must be positive, we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n   - We need to ensure that the number of selected numbers in each row and column is balanced to achieve the required product condition.\n\n4. **Approach**:\n   - Start with the given number at (0,5).\n   - Select numbers ensuring an even number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n   - Check the product condition for each row and column.\n\nLet's implement this strategy using Python to find a valid selection of numbers.\n\n```python\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [-9, 11, 7, 9, 8, 5],\n    [1, 3, -3, -3, -4, 12],\n    [1, 7, 6, 11, 10, 2],\n    [7, 9, 3, 1, 7, 8],\n    [11, -3, 5, 12, 1, 9],\n    [-3, 8, -1, 6, -5, 5]\n]\n\n# Start with the given number at (0,5)\nselected_positions = [(0, 5)]\n\n# Function to check if the product of selected numbers in a row or column is positive\ndef is_product_positive(selected_positions, grid):\n    # Check rows\n    for i in range(6):\n        product = 1\n        count = 0\n        for j in range(6):\n            if (i, j) in selected_positions:\n                product *= grid[i][j]\n                count += 1\n        if count > 0 and product <= 0:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check columns\n    for j in range(6):\n        product = 1\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(6):\n            if (i, j) in selected_positions:\n                product *= grid[i][j]\n                count += 1\n        if count > 0 and product <= 0:\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# Try to select 12 numbers\ndef select_numbers(grid, selected_positions):\n    for i in range(6):\n        for j in range(6):\n            if (i, j) not in selected_positions:\n                selected_positions.append((i, j))\n                if len(selected_positions) == 12 and is_product_positive(selected_positions, grid):\n                    return selected_positions\n                elif len(selected_positions) < 12:\n                    result = select_numbers(grid, selected_positions)\n                    if result:\n                        return result\n                selected_positions.pop()\n    return None\n\n# Find the solution\nsolution = select_numbers(grid, selected_positions)\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to find a valid selection of 12 numbers that satisfy the given conditions.
