  "question": "Given a 3*3 grid where each cell contains a number (between 1 to 4), you must select 4 different numbers from these cells. The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column should be less than or equal to 4. The numbers in the same row are separated by ',', and the coordinate system uses the top-left cell as the coordinate (1,1), with the horizontal coordinate under the top-left cell increasing and the vertical coordinate to the right of the top-left cell increasing.\nUsing the number 1 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) as the first selected number\n4, 4, 1\n3, 2, 1\n2, 2, 4\n\nReturn your answer with the format <<<list of selected number positions>>>, where each position is given as row column (0-based indices). For example, <<<0 3, 1 0, 2 4>>> means numbers selected are at positions (0,3), (1,0), and (2,4).",

    "To solve this problem, we need to select 4 different numbers from the given 3x3 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 1 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) is already selected.\n\nLet's break down the grid:\n\n```\n4, 4, 1\n3, 2, 1\n2, 2, 4\n```\n\nThe selected number at (0,2) is 1. We need to select 3 more numbers from the grid, ensuring that the sum of selected numbers in each row and column is ≤ 4.\n\n1. **Row 0**: We have already selected 1 at (0,2). We can select 3 at (0,0) to keep the sum ≤ 4.\n2. **Row 1**: We can select 1 at (1,2) to keep the sum ≤ 4.\n3. **Row 2**: We can select 2 at (2,1) to keep the sum ≤ 4.\n\nNow, let's check the column constraints:\n\n- **Column 0**: Selected numbers are 3 (from (0,0)) and 2 (from (2,0)), sum = 5. This exceeds 4, so we need to adjust.\n- **Column 1**: Selected number is 2 (from (2,1)), sum = 2.\n- **Column 2**: Selected numbers are 1 (from (0,2)) and 1 (from (1,2)), sum = 2.\n\nTo satisfy the column constraint for column 0, we need to adjust our selection. Let's try selecting 2 at (0,0) instead of 3:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Select 2 at (0,0) and 1 at (0,2), sum = 3.\n2. **Row 1**: Select 1 at (1,2), sum = 1.\n3. **Row 2**: Select 2 at (2,1), sum = 2.\n\nNow, check the column constraints again:\n\n- **Column 0**: Selected number is 2 (from (0,0)), sum = 2.\n- **Column 1**: Selected number is 2 (from (2,1)), sum = 2.\n- **Column 2**: Selected numbers are 1 (from (0,2)) and 1 (from (1,2)), sum = 2.\n\nAll constraints are satisfied. The selected positions are:\n\n- (0,0) for number 2\n- (0,2) for number 1\n- (1,2) for number 1\n- (2,1) for number 2\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 0, 0 2, 1 2, 2 1>>>"
