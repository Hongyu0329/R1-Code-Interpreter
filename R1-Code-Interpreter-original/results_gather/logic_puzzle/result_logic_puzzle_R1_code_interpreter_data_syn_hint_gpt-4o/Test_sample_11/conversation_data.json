    "To solve this problem, we need to select three different numbers from the given 2x2 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 1 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) is already selected.\n\nLet's break down the grid and the constraints:\n\nGrid:\n```\n(0,0) 2, (0,1) 1\n(1,0) 1, (1,1) 3\n```\n\nSelected number: (0,1) with value 1.\n\nWe need to select two more numbers from the remaining cells: (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1).\n\nConstraints:\n1. The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column should be less than or equal to 4.\n\nLet's evaluate the possible selections:\n\n1. If we select (0,0) with value 2 and (1,0) with value 1:\n   - Row 0 sum: 2 + 1 = 3 (satisfies constraint)\n   - Row 1 sum: 1 (satisfies constraint)\n   - Column 0 sum: 2 + 1 = 3 (satisfies constraint)\n   - Column 1 sum: 1 (satisfies constraint)\n\n2. If we select (0,0) with value 2 and (1,1) with value 3:\n   - Row 0 sum: 2 + 1 = 3 (satisfies constraint)\n   - Row 1 sum: 3 (satisfies constraint)\n   - Column 0 sum: 2 (satisfies constraint)\n   - Column 1 sum: 1 + 3 = 4 (satisfies constraint)\n\n3. If we select (1,0) with value 1 and (1,1) with value 3:\n   - Row 0 sum: 1 (satisfies constraint)\n   - Row 1 sum: 1 + 3 = 4 (satisfies constraint)\n   - Column 0 sum: 1 (satisfies constraint)\n   - Column 1 sum: 1 + 3 = 4 (satisfies constraint)\n\nAll three options satisfy the constraints, but we need to select the one that uses the number 1 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) as the first selected number. Since all options use this number, we can choose any of them.\n\nLet's choose the first option for simplicity: (0,0), (0,1), and (1,0).\n\nThus, the selected positions are:\n- (0,0)\n- (0,1)\n- (1,0)\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 0, 0 1, 1 0>>>"
