  "question": "Given a 2*2 grid where each cell contains a number (between 1 to 3), you must select 3 different numbers from these cells. The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column should be less than or equal to 4. The numbers in the same row are separated by ',', and the coordinate system uses the top-left cell as the coordinate (1,1), with the horizontal coordinate under the top-left cell increasing and the vertical coordinate to the right of the top-left cell increasing.\nUsing the number 3 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) as the first selected number\n2, 3\n3, 1\n\nReturn your answer with the format <<<list of selected number positions>>>, where each position is given as row column (0-based indices). For example, <<<0 3, 1 0, 2 4>>> means numbers selected are at positions (0,3), (1,0), and (2,4).",

    "To solve this problem, we need to select three different numbers from the given 2x2 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 3 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) is already selected.\n\nThe grid is as follows:\n\n```\n2, 3\n3, 1\n```\n\nThe coordinates for each cell are:\n- (0,0): 2\n- (0,1): 3\n- (1,0): 3\n- (1,1): 1\n\nWe need to select two more numbers from the remaining cells: (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1).\n\nLet's analyze the constraints:\n1. The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column should be less than or equal to 4.\n2. We have already selected the number 3 at position (0,1).\n\nNow, let's consider the possible selections:\n\n- If we select the number at (0,0) which is 2, the sum for row 0 would be 2 + 3 = 5, which exceeds the limit of 4. So, we cannot select (0,0).\n\n- If we select the number at (1,0) which is 3, the sum for column 0 would be 2 + 3 = 5, which exceeds the limit of 4. So, we cannot select (1,0).\n\n- If we select the number at (1,1) which is 1, the sum for row 1 would be 3 + 1 = 4, which is within the limit. The sum for column 1 would be 3 + 1 = 4, which is also within the limit.\n\nTherefore, the only valid selection is to choose the number at (1,1).\n\nThus, the selected numbers are at positions (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1).\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 1, 1 0, 1 1>>>"
