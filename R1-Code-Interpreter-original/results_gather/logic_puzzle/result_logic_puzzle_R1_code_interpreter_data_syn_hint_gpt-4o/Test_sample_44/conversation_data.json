    "To solve this problem, we need to select 6 different numbers from the given 4x4 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,3) is already selected.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**: \n   - The grid is:\n     ```\n     7, -2, 4, 2\n     2, 4, 3, 8\n     1, 5, -3, -3\n     2, 7, -4, 6\n     ```\n   - We need to select 6 numbers, and one of them is already selected at position (0,3).\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - The product of selected numbers in each row and column must be greater than 0.\n   - This implies that for each row and column with selected numbers, the product must be positive.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - We need to ensure that the selected numbers in each row and column have an even number of negative numbers or no negative numbers at all.\n   - We will start by selecting the number at (0,3) and then choose additional numbers while ensuring the constraints are met.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - We will iterate through possible combinations of numbers and check if they satisfy the conditions.\n   - We will use Python to automate the checking process.\n\nLet's implement the code to find a valid selection of numbers.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [7, -2, 4, 2],\n    [2, 4, 3, 8],\n    [1, 5, -3, -3],\n    [2, 7, -4, 6]\n]\n\n# Pre-select the given number\nselected_positions = [(0, 3)]\n\n# Function to check if the product of numbers in a list is positive\ndef is_positive_product(positions):\n    row_products = [1] * 4\n    col_products = [1] * 4\n    for r, c in positions:\n        row_products[r] *= grid[r][c]\n        col_products[c] *= grid[r][c]\n    return all(p > 0 for p in row_products) and all(p > 0 for p in col_products)\n\n# Generate all possible combinations of 5 additional positions\nall_positions = [(r, c) for r in range(4) for c in range(4) if (r, c) != (0, 3)]\nfor additional_positions in combinations(all_positions, 5):\n    current_selection = selected_positions + list(additional_positions)\n    if is_positive_product(current_selection):\n        print(current_selection)\n        break\n```\n\nThis code will find a valid selection of 6 numbers, including the pre-selected number, that satisfies the condition of having a positive product in each row and column. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code execution result indicates that a valid selection of numbers was found, but we need to ensure that the solution is correct and meets all the constraints. Let's verify the solution and ensure that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is indeed positive.\n\n### Verification of the Solution:\n\n1. **Selected Positions**: \n   - The selected positions are [(0, 3), (0, 0), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2)].\n\n2. **Selected Numbers**:\n   - From the grid, the selected numbers are:\n     - Row 0: 2 (at 0,3), 7 (at 0,0), 4 (at 0,2)\n     - Row 1: 2 (at 1,0), 4 (at 1,1), 3 (at 1,2)\n\n3. **Product Calculation**:\n   - **Row 0 Product**: 2 * 7 * 4 = 56 (positive)\n   - **Row 1 Product**: 2 * 4 * 3 = 24 (positive)\n   - **Column 0 Product**: 7 * 2 = 14 (positive)\n   - **Column 1 Product**: 4 (positive)\n   - **Column 2 Product**: 4 * 3 = 12 (positive)\n   - **Column 3 Product**: 2 (positive)\n\nThe solution satisfies the condition that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive. Therefore, the solution is valid.\n\nLet's finalize the answer in the required format.\n\n<<<0 3, 0 0, 0 2, 1 0, 1 1, 1 2>>>"
