  "question": "Given a 4*4 grid where each cell contains a number (between -4 to 8), you must select 6 different numbers from these cells. The product of each row and column of the selected number must be greater than 0. The numbers in the same row are separated by ',', and the coordinate system uses the top-left cell as the coordinate (1,1), with the horizontal coordinate under the top-left cell increasing and the vertical coordinate to the right of the top-left cell increasing.\nUsing the number 6 in the top-rightmost square (0,3) as the first selected number\n7, -3, 5, 6\n6, 6, -3, 2\n4, 4, 5, -4\n2, 8, 8, 7\n\nReturn your answer with the format <<<list of selected number positions>>>, where each position is given as row column (0-based indices).

    "To solve this problem, we need to select 6 different numbers from the given 4x4 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 6 in the top-rightmost square (0,3) is already selected.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**: \n   - The grid is:\n     ```\n     7, -3, 5, 6\n     6, 6, -3, 2\n     4, 4, 5, -4\n     2, 8, 8, 7\n     ```\n   - We need to select 6 numbers, and one of them is already selected at position (0,3).\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - The product of selected numbers in each row and column must be greater than 0.\n   - This implies that for each row and column with selected numbers, the count of negative numbers must be even (including zero negatives).\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Start with the given number at (0,3).\n   - Select additional numbers ensuring the product condition is satisfied for each row and column.\n   - We need to carefully choose numbers to ensure the product condition is met.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - We will iterate over possible combinations of numbers and check if they satisfy the conditions.\n   - We will use Python to automate the checking process.\n\nLet's implement the code to find a valid selection of numbers.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [7, -3, 5, 6],\n    [6, 6, -3, 2],\n    [4, 4, 5, -4],\n    [2, 8, 8, 7]\n]\n\n# Pre-select the given number\nselected_positions = [(0, 3)]\n\n# Function to check if the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive\ndef is_valid_selection(positions):\n    row_products = [1] * 4\n    col_products = [1] * 4\n    \n    for r, c in positions:\n        row_products[r] *= grid[r][c]\n        col_products[c] *= grid[r][c]\n    \n    return all(p > 0 for p in row_products) and all(p > 0 for p in col_products)\n\n# Generate all possible combinations of 5 additional positions\nall_positions = [(r, c) for r in range(4) for c in range(4) if (r, c) != (0, 3)]\nfor additional_positions in combinations(all_positions, 5):\n    current_selection = selected_positions + list(additional_positions)\n    if is_valid_selection(current_selection):\n        print(current_selection)\n        break\n```\n\nThis code will find a valid selection of 6 numbers, including the pre-selected number, that satisfies the product condition for each row and column.",
    "The code execution result indicates that a valid selection of numbers was found, but we need to ensure that the solution is correct and meets all the constraints. Let's verify the selected positions and their corresponding numbers:\n\n1. **Selected Positions**: \n   - (0, 3): 6\n   - (0, 0): 7\n   - (0, 2): 5\n   - (1, 0): 6\n   - (1, 1): 6\n   - (1, 3): 2\n\n2. **Verification**:\n   - **Row 0**: Numbers are 7, 5, 6. Product = 7 * 5 * 6 = 210 (positive)\n   - **Row 1**: Numbers are 6, 6, 2. Product = 6 * 6 * 2 = 72 (positive)\n   - **Column 0**: Numbers are 7, 6. Product = 7 * 6 = 42 (positive)\n   - **Column 1**: Numbers are 6. Product = 6 (positive)\n   - **Column 2**: Numbers are 5. Product = 5 (positive)\n   - **Column 3**: Numbers are 6, 2. Product = 6 * 2 = 12 (positive)\n\nAll row and column products are positive, satisfying the problem's constraints. Therefore, the selected positions are valid.\n\nNow, let's format the final answer as requested:\n\n<<<0 3, 0 0, 0 2, 1 0, 1 1, 1 3>>>"
