  "question": "Given a 3*3 grid where each cell contains a number (between 1 to 4), you must select 4 different numbers from these cells. The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column should be less than or equal to 4. The numbers in the same row are separated by ',', and the coordinate system uses the top-left cell as the coordinate (1,1), with the horizontal coordinate under the top-left cell increasing and the vertical coordinate to the right of the top-left cell increasing.\nUsing the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) as the first selected number\n3, 1, 2\n2, 4, 4\n3, 2, 1\n\nReturn your answer with the format <<<list of selected number positions>>>, where each position is given as row column (0-based indices). For example, <<<0 3, 1 0, 2 4>>> means numbers selected are at positions (0,3), (1,0), and (2,4).",

    "To solve this problem, we need to select 4 different numbers from the 3x3 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) is already selected.\n\nLet's break down the grid:\n\n```\n3, 1, 2\n2, 4, 4\n3, 2, 1\n```\n\nThe coordinates for each cell are as follows:\n\n```\n(0,0), (0,1), (0,2)\n(1,0), (1,1), (1,2)\n(2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n```\n\nWe have already selected the number at (0,2), which is 2. Now, we need to select 3 more numbers such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4.\n\nLet's consider the constraints:\n- The sum of selected numbers in each row and column should be â‰¤ 4.\n- We need to select 4 different numbers.\n\nWe can start by selecting numbers that are 1 or 2, as they are more likely to satisfy the sum constraint.\n\nLet's try to find a combination that satisfies these conditions:\n\n1. We have already selected (0,2) = 2.\n2. We can select (0,1) = 1, which makes the sum of the first row 3.\n3. We can select (2,2) = 1, which makes the sum of the third column 3.\n4. We can select (1,0) = 2, which makes the sum of the first column 5, which is not valid.\n\nLet's try another combination:\n\n1. We have already selected (0,2) = 2.\n2. We can select (0,1) = 1, which makes the sum of the first row 3.\n3. We can select (2,0) = 3, which makes the sum of the first column 3.\n4. We can select (1,1) = 4, which makes the sum of the second row 4.\n\nNow, let's check the sums:\n- Row 0: 3 (valid)\n- Row 1: 4 (valid)\n- Row 2: 3 (valid)\n- Column 0: 3 (valid)\n- Column 1: 5 (not valid)\n- Column 2: 3 (valid)\n\nThe sum of the second column is not valid. Let's try another combination:\n\n1. We have already selected (0,2) = 2.\n2. We can select (0,0) = 3, which makes the sum of the first row 5, which is not valid.\n\nLet's try another combination:\n\n1. We have already selected (0,2) = 2.\n2. We can select (1,0) = 2, which makes the sum of the first column 4.\n3. We can select (2,1) = 2, which makes the sum of the second column 4.\n4. We can select (0,1) = 1, which makes the sum of the first row 3.\n\nNow, let's check the sums:\n- Row 0: 3 (valid)\n- Row 1: 2 (valid)\n- Row 2: 2 (valid)\n- Column 0: 4 (valid)\n- Column 1: 4 (valid)\n- Column 2: 2 (valid)\n\nThis combination satisfies all the constraints. Therefore, the selected positions are:\n\n<<<0 2, 1 0, 2 1, 0 1>>>"
