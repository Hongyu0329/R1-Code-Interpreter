    "To solve this problem, we need to select 16 different numbers from the given 7x7 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 7 in the top-rightmost square (0,6) is the first selected number.\n\nThe key points to consider are:\n1. The product of numbers in each row and column must be positive, which means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n2. We need to select exactly 16 numbers, which means we will have 4 rows and 4 columns with selected numbers.\n3. We need to ensure that the selected numbers are distributed in such a way that the product condition is satisfied.\n\nLet's start by selecting numbers from the grid, ensuring that the product condition is met. We will use a systematic approach to select numbers from each row and column.\n\n### Step-by-step Approach:\n1. Start with the given number 7 at position (0,6).\n2. Select numbers from each row and column, ensuring an even number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n3. Check the product condition for each row and column after selecting numbers.\n\nLet's implement this approach using Python code to find a valid selection of numbers.\n\n```python\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [10, -10, -5, -13, -7, 5, 7],\n    [13, 14, 3, 3, 3, -9, 6],\n    [2, -10, -9, 5, -3, 12, -13],\n    [-3, 14, 12, 9, 11, 6, 5],\n    [10, 1, 13, 9, 8, 6, 3],\n    [8, 2, -4, 8, 12, 8, 4],\n    [13, 1, 14, -2, 1, -13, 1]\n]\n\n# Initialize the selected positions with the given number\nselected_positions = [(0, 6)]\n\n# Function to check if the product of selected numbers in a row or column is positive\ndef is_product_positive(selected_positions, grid):\n    row_count = [0] * 7\n    col_count = [0] * 7\n    for r, c in selected_positions:\n        if grid[r][c] < 0:\n            row_count[r] += 1\n            col_count[c] += 1\n    for count in row_count + col_count:\n        if count % 2 != 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Function to select numbers ensuring the product condition\ndef select_numbers(grid, selected_positions):\n    for r in range(7):\n        for c in range(7):\n            if (r, c) not in selected_positions:\n                selected_positions.append((r, c))\n                if len(selected_positions) == 16 and is_product_positive(selected_positions, grid):\n                    return selected_positions\n                if len(selected_positions) < 16:\n                    result = select_numbers(grid, selected_positions)\n                    if result:\n                        return result\n                selected_positions.pop()\n    return None\n\n# Find the valid selection of numbers\nresult = select_numbers(grid, selected_positions)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to find a valid selection of 16 numbers from the grid that satisfies the product condition for each row and column. The function `select_numbers` recursively selects numbers and checks the product condition using `is_product_positive`. If a valid selection is found, it returns the list of selected positions.",
