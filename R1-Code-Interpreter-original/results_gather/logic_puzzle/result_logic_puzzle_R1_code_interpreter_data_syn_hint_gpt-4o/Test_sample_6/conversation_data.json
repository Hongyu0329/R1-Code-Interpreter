    "To solve this problem, we need to select three different numbers from the given 2x2 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 1 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) is already selected.\n\nThe grid is as follows:\n\n```\n3, 1\n3, 2\n```\n\nThe coordinates for each cell are:\n- (0,0): 3\n- (0,1): 1\n- (1,0): 3\n- (1,1): 2\n\nWe have already selected the number at (0,1), which is 1. Now, we need to select two more numbers from the remaining cells: (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1).\n\nLet's evaluate the possible selections:\n\n1. If we select (0,0) and (1,1):\n   - Row 0 sum: 3 (from (0,0)) + 1 (from (0,1)) = 4\n   - Row 1 sum: 2 (from (1,1))\n   - Column 0 sum: 3 (from (0,0))\n   - Column 1 sum: 1 (from (0,1)) + 2 (from (1,1)) = 3\n\n2. If we select (1,0) and (1,1):\n   - Row 0 sum: 1 (from (0,1))\n   - Row 1 sum: 3 (from (1,0)) + 2 (from (1,1)) = 5 (exceeds 4)\n   - Column 0 sum: 3 (from (1,0))\n   - Column 1 sum: 1 (from (0,1)) + 2 (from (1,1)) = 3\n\n3. If we select (0,0) and (1,0):\n   - Row 0 sum: 3 (from (0,0)) + 1 (from (0,1)) = 4\n   - Row 1 sum: 3 (from (1,0))\n   - Column 0 sum: 3 (from (0,0)) + 3 (from (1,0)) = 6 (exceeds 4)\n   - Column 1 sum: 1 (from (0,1))\n\nFrom the above evaluations, the only valid selection that satisfies the condition of the sum being less than or equal to 4 for each row and column is selecting the numbers at positions (0,0), (0,1), and (1,1).\n\nThus, the selected positions are (0,0), (0,1), and (1,1).\n\n<<<0 0, 0 1, 1 1>>>"
