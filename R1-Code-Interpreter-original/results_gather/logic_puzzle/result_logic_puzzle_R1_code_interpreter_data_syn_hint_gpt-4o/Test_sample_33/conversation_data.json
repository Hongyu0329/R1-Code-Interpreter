    "To solve this problem, we need to select 6 different numbers from the given 4x4 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number -5 in the top-rightmost square (0,3) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**: \n   - The grid is:\n     ```\n     6, 1, -5, -5\n     8, -4, -4, 2\n     -4, 2, 8, 5\n     4, 8, -2, 5\n     ```\n   - We need to select 6 numbers, including the number at (0,3), which is -5.\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - The product of selected numbers in each row and column must be greater than 0.\n   - This implies that for each row and column with selected numbers, the count of negative numbers must be even (including zero negatives).\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Start with the given number at (0,3).\n   - Select additional numbers ensuring the product constraint is satisfied.\n   - We need to carefully choose numbers to ensure the product of each row and column is positive.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - We will iterate over possible combinations of numbers and check if they satisfy the constraints.\n   - We will use Python to automate the checking process.\n\nLet's write a Python script to find a valid selection of numbers.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [6, 1, -5, -5],\n    [8, -4, -4, 2],\n    [-4, 2, 8, 5],\n    [4, 8, -2, 5]\n]\n\n# Pre-select the given number\nselected_positions = [(0, 3)]\n\n# Function to check if a selection is valid\ndef is_valid_selection(positions):\n    # Check row and column products\n    row_products = [1] * 4\n    col_products = [1] * 4\n    for r, c in positions:\n        row_products[r] *= grid[r][c]\n        col_products[c] *= grid[r][c]\n    return all(p > 0 for p in row_products) and all(p > 0 for p in col_products)\n\n# Generate all possible combinations of 5 additional positions\nall_positions = [(r, c) for r in range(4) for c in range(4) if (r, c) != (0, 3)]\nfor additional_positions in combinations(all_positions, 5):\n    current_selection = selected_positions + list(additional_positions)\n    if is_valid_selection(current_selection):\n        # Convert positions to the required format\n        result = ', '.join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in current_selection)\n        print(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n        break\n```\n\nThis script will find a valid selection of numbers that satisfy the constraints and print the result in the required format."
