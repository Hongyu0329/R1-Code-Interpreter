    "To solve this problem, we need to select 6 different numbers from the given 4x4 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number at position (0,3) is -1 and it is already selected.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**: \n   - The grid is:\n     ```\n     -4, 5, 7, -1\n     2, -4, -2, -5\n     6, 6, -4, 4\n     -1, 2, 1, -1\n     ```\n   - We need to select 5 more numbers since one number is already selected at (0,3).\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - The product of selected numbers in each row and column must be greater than 0.\n   - This implies that the product must be positive, which can be achieved by having an even number of negative numbers or all positive numbers in each row and column.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Start with the given number at (0,3) which is -1.\n   - Select numbers such that each row and column containing a selected number has a positive product.\n   - Ensure that the total number of selected numbers is 6.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - We will try to select numbers such that the conditions are satisfied.\n   - We will use a systematic approach to check combinations and ensure the product conditions are met.\n\nLet's proceed with the implementation to find a valid selection of numbers.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [-4, 5, 7, -1],\n    [2, -4, -2, -5],\n    [6, 6, -4, 4],\n    [-1, 2, 1, -1]\n]\n\n# Pre-selected position\nselected_positions = [(0, 3)]\n\n# Function to calculate product of selected numbers in a row or column\ndef product_of_selected(selected, grid, is_row=True):\n    products = [1] * 4\n    for r, c in selected:\n        if is_row:\n            products[r] *= grid[r][c]\n        else:\n            products[c] *= grid[r][c]\n    return products\n\n# Check if the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive\ndef is_valid_selection(selected, grid):\n    row_products = product_of_selected(selected, grid, is_row=True)\n    col_products = product_of_selected(selected, grid, is_row=False)\n    return all(p > 0 for p in row_products) and all(p > 0 for p in col_products)\n\n# Generate all possible combinations of 5 additional positions\nall_positions = [(r, c) for r in range(4) for c in range(4) if (r, c) != (0, 3)]\nfor additional_positions in combinations(all_positions, 5):\n    selected = selected_positions + list(additional_positions)\n    if is_valid_selection(selected, grid):\n        # Format the output as required\n        result = ', '.join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in selected)\n        print(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n        break\n```\n\nThis code will find a valid selection of 6 numbers from the grid that satisfies the given conditions.",
    "The code execution result provided a valid selection of numbers, but it seems there was an error in the output format or logic. Let's analyze the situation and ensure the solution meets all the criteria.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Selected Numbers**: The output suggests selecting numbers at positions (0,3), (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (3,0), and (3,3).\n2. **Product Check**: We need to ensure that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive.\n\n### Verification:\n- **Row 0**: Positions (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3) are selected. The numbers are -4, 5, 7, -1. The product is positive because there are two negative numbers.\n- **Row 3**: Positions (3,0), (3,3) are selected. The numbers are -1, -1. The product is positive because there are two negative numbers.\n- **Column 0**: Positions (0,0), (3,0) are selected. The numbers are -4, -1. The product is positive because there are two negative numbers.\n- **Column 3**: Positions (0,3), (3,3) are selected. The numbers are -1, -1. The product is positive because there are two negative numbers.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe selected positions satisfy the condition that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive. The output format is correct, and the solution is valid.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 3, 0 0, 0 1, 0 2, 3 0, 3 3>>>"
