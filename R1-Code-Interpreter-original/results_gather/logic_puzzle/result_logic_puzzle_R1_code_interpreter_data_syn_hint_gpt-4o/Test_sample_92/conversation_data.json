    "To solve this problem, we need to select 12 different numbers from the given 6x6 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,5) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**: We have a 6x6 grid with numbers ranging from -10 to 12. We need to select 12 numbers, ensuring that the product of numbers in each row and column is positive.\n\n2. **Constraints**: \n   - The product of numbers in each row and column must be positive. This implies that each row and column must have an even number of negative numbers (including zero negatives).\n   - We must select exactly 12 numbers, and they must be distinct.\n\n3. **Initial Selection**: We start with the number at position (0,5), which is 2.\n\n4. **Strategy**:\n   - We need to ensure that each row and column has an even number of negative numbers.\n   - We can start by selecting numbers that are positive or zero to avoid introducing negative products.\n   - We need to carefully select negative numbers to ensure they are paired in each row and column.\n\n5. **Implementation**: We will use a systematic approach to select numbers, ensuring the constraints are met. We will use Python to help us compute and verify the selection.\n\nLet's proceed with the implementation:\n\n```python\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [-4, 2, 3, -10, 11, 2],\n    [5, 4, -6, -10, 4, 4],\n    [6, -9, 4, 12, 6, 8],\n    [12, -10, 6, 6, -5, 1],\n    [11, -4, 1, 11, 11, 7],\n    [-5, -3, 10, 11, -6, 12]\n]\n\n# Start with the given number at position (0,5)\nselected_positions = [(0, 5)]\n\n# Function to check if the current selection is valid\ndef is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n    # Check row and column products\n    row_products = [1] * 6\n    col_products = [1] * 6\n    for r, c in selected_positions:\n        row_products[r] *= grid[r][c]\n        col_products[c] *= grid[r][c]\n    return all(p > 0 for p in row_products) and all(p > 0 for p in col_products)\n\n# Try to select 12 numbers\ndef select_numbers():\n    # Start with the initial selection\n    selected_positions = [(0, 5)]\n    # Iterate over the grid to select numbers\n    for r in range(6):\n        for c in range(6):\n            if (r, c) not in selected_positions:\n                selected_positions.append((r, c))\n                if len(selected_positions) == 12:\n                    if is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n                        return selected_positions\n                    selected_positions.pop()\n    return None\n\n# Get the selected positions\nselected_positions = select_numbers()\n\n# Print the selected positions\nprint(selected_positions)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to select 12 numbers from the grid, starting with the given number at position (0,5), and ensure that the product of numbers in each row and column is positive. The output will be the list of selected positions.",
    "The previous approach was too simplistic and did not effectively solve the problem. Let's switch to a more structured reasoning process to ensure we meet the constraints of the problem.\n\n### Problem Restatement\nWe need to select 12 numbers from a 6x6 grid such that:\n- The product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive.\n- We start with the number at position (0,5), which is 2.\n\n### Strategy\n1. **Initial Selection**: Start with the number at (0,5).\n2. **Positive Product Requirement**: Ensure that each row and column has an even number of negative numbers.\n3. **Selection Process**:\n   - Prioritize selecting positive numbers to maintain positive products.\n   - Carefully select negative numbers to ensure they are paired in each row and column.\n\n### Revised Approach\n1. **Identify Positive Numbers**: List all positive numbers and their positions.\n2. **Select Negative Numbers**: Pair negative numbers in each row and column to maintain positive products.\n3. **Iterative Selection**: Use a backtracking approach to explore possible selections and validate them.\n\nLet's implement this revised approach using Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [-4, 2, 3, -10, 11, 2],\n    [5, 4, -6, -10, 4, 4],\n    [6, -9, 4, 12, 6, 8],\n    [12, -10, 6, 6, -5, 1],\n    [11, -4, 1, 11, 11, 7],\n    [-5, -3, 10, 11, -6, 12]\n]\n\n# Start with the given number at position (0,5)\nselected_positions = [(0, 5)]\n\n# Function to check if the current selection is valid\ndef is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n    # Check row and column products\n    row_products = [1] * 6\n    col_products = [1] * 6\n    for r, c in selected_positions:\n        row_products[r] *= grid[r][c]\n        col_products[c] *= grid[r][c]\n    return all(p > 0 for p in row_products) and all(p > 0 for p in col_products)\n\n# Function to select numbers\ndef select_numbers():\n    # Start with the initial selection\n    selected_positions = [(0, 5)]\n    # List of all positions\n    all_positions = [(r, c) for r in range(6) for c in range(6)]\n    # Remove the initial position\n    all_positions.remove((0, 5))\n    \n    # Backtracking function\n    def backtrack(selected_positions):\n        if len(selected_positions) == 12:\n            if is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n                return selected_positions\n            return None\n        \n        for pos in all_positions:\n            if pos not in selected_positions:\n                selected_positions.append(pos)\n                result = backtrack(selected_positions)\n                if result:\n                    return result\n                selected_positions.pop()\n        return None\n    \n    return backtrack(selected_positions)\n\n# Get the selected positions\nselected_positions = select_numbers()\n\n# Print the selected positions\nprint(selected_positions)\n```\n\nThis code uses a backtracking approach to explore possible selections of numbers from the grid, ensuring that the product of numbers in each row and column is positive.

    "The previous approach using backtracking was not efficient enough, leading to a timeout.
