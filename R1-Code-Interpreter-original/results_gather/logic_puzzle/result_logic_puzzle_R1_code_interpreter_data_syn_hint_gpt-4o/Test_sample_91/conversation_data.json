    "To solve this problem, we need to select 12 different numbers from the 6x6 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 8 in the top-rightmost square (0,5) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Understanding the Grid**: We have a 6x6 grid with numbers ranging from -12 to 12. We need to select 12 numbers such that the product of numbers in each row and column is positive.\n\n2. **Constraints**: \n   - We must select 12 different numbers.\n   - The product of selected numbers in each row and column must be positive.\n   - We start with the number 8 at position (0,5).\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Since the product must be positive, we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n   - We can start by selecting numbers that are positive or zero, as they will not affect the sign of the product.\n   - We need to ensure that the number of selected numbers in each row and column is balanced to maintain a positive product.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - We will iterate through the grid and select numbers while keeping track of the number of selected numbers in each row and column.\n   - We will ensure that the product condition is satisfied by carefully choosing numbers.\n\nLet's implement this strategy in code to find the positions of the selected numbers.\n\n```python\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [12, 3, 5, 8, 1, 8],\n    [12, 8, 1, 3, 1, 2],\n    [5, 4, -9, -8, 9, -4],\n    [7, 10, -6, -7, 7, 6],\n    [3, 1, 10, 9, -10, 12],\n    [2, 11, -4, 8, 11, -12]\n]\n\n# Start with the given number\nselected_positions = [(0, 5)]\n\n# Function to check if the product of selected numbers in a row or column is positive\ndef is_product_positive(selected_positions, grid):\n    row_count = [0] * 6\n    col_count = [0] * 6\n    row_product = [1] * 6\n    col_product = [1] * 6\n    \n    for r, c in selected_positions:\n        row_count[r] += 1\n        col_count[c] += 1\n        row_product[r] *= grid[r][c]\n        col_product[c] *= grid[r][c]\n    \n    for i in range(6):\n        if row_count[i] > 0 and row_product[i] <= 0:\n            return False\n        if col_count[i] > 0 and col_product[i] <= 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Select numbers ensuring the product condition\nfor r in range(6):\n    for c in range(6):\n        if len(selected_positions) >= 12:\n            break\n        if (r, c) not in selected_positions:\n            selected_positions.append((r, c))\n            if not is_product_positive(selected_positions, grid):\n                selected_positions.pop()\n\n# Print the selected positions\nprint(selected_positions)\n```\n\nThis code will select 12 numbers from the grid while ensuring the product condition is met.
