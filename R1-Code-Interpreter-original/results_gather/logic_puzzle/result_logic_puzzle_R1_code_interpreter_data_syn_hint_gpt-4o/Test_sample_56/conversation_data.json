    "To solve this problem, we need to select 9 different numbers from the given 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number -1 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Constraints**: \n   - We need to select 9 numbers.\n   - The product of numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers must be greater than 0.\n   - The number -1 at position (0,4) is already selected.\n\n2. **Grid Analysis**:\n   - The grid is:\n     ```\n     -5, 7, -7, 6, -1\n     -2, 2, 8, 6, -3\n     3, 4, 4, 3, 8\n     -8, -2, 5, 8, 2\n     -2, 6, 8, 2, -1\n     ```\n   - We need to ensure that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive. This means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Start with the given number -1 at (0,4).\n   - Select numbers such that each row and column of the selected numbers has an even number of negative numbers.\n   - Ensure that the total number of selected numbers is 9.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - We will use a combination of reasoning and code to find a valid selection of numbers.\n\nLet's proceed with the implementation to find a valid selection of numbers.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Given grid\ngrid = [\n    [-5, 7, -7, 6, -1],\n    [-2, 2, 8, 6, -3],\n    [3, 4, 4, 3, 8],\n    [-8, -2, 5, 8, 2],\n    [-2, 6, 8, 2, -1]\n]\n\n# Start with the given number -1 at (0,4)\nselected_positions = [(0, 4)]\n\n# Function to check if the product of numbers in each row and column is positive\ndef is_valid_selection(positions):\n    row_count = [0] * 5\n    col_count = [0] * 5\n    for r, c in positions:\n        if grid[r][c] < 0:\n            row_count[r] += 1\n            col_count[c] += 1\n    return all(count % 2 == 0 for count in row_count) and all(count % 2 == 0 for count in col_count)\n\n# Try to find a valid selection of 9 numbers\nfor positions in itertools.combinations([(r, c) for r in range(5) for c in range(5) if (r, c) != (0, 4)], 8):\n    positions = selected_positions + list(positions)\n    if is_valid_selection(positions):\n        print(positions)\n        break\n```\n\nThe code will find a valid selection of 9 numbers, including the given number at (0,4), such that the product of numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers is positive.
