    "To solve this problem, we need to select 12 different numbers from the grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 11 in the top-rightmost square (0,5) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial Selection**: We start with the number 11 at position (0,5).\n\n2. **Product Constraint**: For each row and column, the product of the selected numbers must be greater than 0. This means:\n   - The product must be positive, which implies an even number of negative numbers or all positive numbers in each row and column.\n\n3. **Selection Strategy**:\n   - We need to ensure that each row and column has a positive product.\n   - We should aim to balance the number of negative and positive numbers in each row and column.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - We will iterate through the grid and select numbers while keeping track of the product of each row and column.\n   - We will ensure that the selection of numbers satisfies the product constraint.\n\nLet's implement this strategy using Python code to find a valid selection of numbers.\n\n```python\ngrid = [\n    [-2, 9, -9, -3, -3, 11],\n    [10, 10, 9, 6, 5, -11],\n    [5, 11, 9, 9, 1, 8],\n    [4, 3, -5, -11, 4, 10],\n    [11, -8, 6, 6, 2, 7],\n    [-12, -11, 6, 2, 5, -3]\n]\n\n# Start with the given number\nselected_positions = [(0, 5)]\nselected_numbers = [11]\n\n# Function to check if the product of selected numbers in a row or column is positive\ndef is_product_positive(selected_positions, grid):\n    row_products = [1] * 6\n    col_products = [1] * 6\n    for r, c in selected_positions:\n        row_products[r] *= grid[r][c]\n        col_products[c] *= grid[r][c]\n    return all(p > 0 for p in row_products) and all(p > 0 for p in col_products)\n\n# Try to select 12 numbers\nfor r in range(6):\n    for c in range(6):\n        if (r, c) not in selected_positions:\n            selected_positions.append((r, c))\n            selected_numbers.append(grid[r][c])\n            if len(selected_positions) == 12:\n                if is_product_positive(selected_positions, grid):\n                    break\n                else:\n                    selected_positions.pop()\n                    selected_numbers.pop()\n    if len(selected_positions) == 12:\n        break\n\n# Output the selected positions\nprint(selected_positions)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to select 12 numbers from the grid while ensuring that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is positive.
