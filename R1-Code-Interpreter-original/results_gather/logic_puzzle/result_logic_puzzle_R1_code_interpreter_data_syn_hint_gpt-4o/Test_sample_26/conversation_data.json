The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column should be less than or equal to 4.

    "To solve this problem, we need to select 4 different numbers from the 3x3 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) is already selected.\n\nLet's break down the grid:\n\n```\n1, 1, 2\n3, 4, 3\n4, 4, 3\n```\n\nThe selected number 2 is at position (0,2).\n\nNow, we need to select 3 more numbers from the grid, ensuring that:\n1. The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is ≤ 4.\n2. All selected numbers are different.\n\nLet's analyze the grid and constraints:\n\n- Row 0: We have already selected 2 at (0,2). We can select 1 from (0,0) or (0,1) to keep the sum ≤ 4.\n- Row 1: We can select 3 from (1,0) to keep the sum ≤ 4.\n- Row 2: We can select 3 from (2,2) to keep the sum ≤ 4.\n\nLet's verify the column constraints:\n- Column 0: Selecting 1 from (0,0) and 3 from (1,0) gives a sum of 4.\n- Column 1: Selecting 1 from (0,1) and no other number gives a sum of 1.\n- Column 2: We have already selected 2 from (0,2) and 3 from (2,2), giving a sum of 5, which violates the constraint.\n\nTo satisfy the column constraint, we need to adjust our selection. Let's try selecting 1 from (0,0), 3 from (1,0), and 4 from (2,1).\n\n- Row 0: 1 (from 0,0) + 2 (from 0,2) = 3\n- Row 1: 3 (from 1,0) = 3\n- Row 2: 4 (from 2,1) = 4\n\n- Column 0: 1 (from 0,0) + 3 (from 1,0) = 4\n- Column 1: 4 (from 2,1) = 4\n- Column 2: 2 (from 0,2) = 2\n\nThis selection satisfies all constraints. Let's finalize the selected positions:\n\n- (0,0) for number 1\n- (0,2) for number 2 (already selected)\n- (1,0) for number 3\n- (2,1) for number 4\n\nThus, the selected positions are (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), and (2,1).\n\n<<<0 0, 0 2, 1 0, 2 1>>>"
