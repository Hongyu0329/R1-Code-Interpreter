  "question": "Given a 4*4 grid where each cell contains a number (between -5 to 8), you must select 6 different numbers from these cells. The product of each row and column of the selected number must be greater than 0. The numbers in the same row are separated by ',', and the coordinate system uses the top-left cell as the coordinate (1,1), with the horizontal coordinate under the top-left cell increasing and the vertical coordinate to the right of the top-left cell increasing.\nUsing the number -1 in the top-rightmost square (0,3) as the first selected number\n8, 6, 2, -1\n1, 8, -3, 5\n4, -4, 1, 4\n8, 7, -5, 3\n\nReturn your answer with the format <<<list of selected number positions>>>, where each position is given as row column (0-based indices). For example, <<<0 3, 1 0, 2 4>>> means numbers selected are at positions (0,3), (1,0), and (2,4).",

    "To solve this problem, we need to select 6 different numbers from the given 4x4 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number at position (0,3) is -1, and it must be included in our selection.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**: We have a 4x4 grid with numbers ranging from -5 to 8. We need to select 6 numbers, including the number at (0,3), which is -1.\n\n2. **Product Condition**: The product of the selected numbers in each row and column must be greater than 0. This implies that the product must be positive.\n\n3. **Selection Strategy**: Since we have a negative number (-1) at (0,3), we need to ensure that the product of the selected numbers in each row and column is positive. This means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column where a negative number is present.\n\n4. **Initial Selection**: Start with the number at (0,3) which is -1. We need to select 5 more numbers.\n\n5. **Balancing Negatives**: We need to ensure that the number of negative numbers in each row and column is even to make the product positive.\n\nLet's proceed with the selection:\n\n- Start with (0,3) = -1.\n- Select (0,0) = 8, (0,1) = 6, (1,1) = 8, (2,2) = 1, and (3,0) = 8.\n\nNow, let's verify the product condition for each row and column:\n\n- **Row 0**: Selected numbers are 8, 6, -1. Product = 8 * 6 * (-1) = -48 (not valid, need adjustment).\n- **Row 1**: Selected numbers are 8. Product = 8 (valid).\n- **Row 2**: Selected numbers are 1. Product = 1 (valid).\n- **Row 3**: Selected numbers are 8. Product = 8 (valid).\n\n- **Column 0**: Selected numbers are 8, 8. Product = 8 * 8 = 64 (valid).\n- **Column 1**: Selected numbers are 6, 8. Product = 6 * 8 = 48 (valid).\n- **Column 2**: Selected numbers are 1. Product = 1 (valid).\n- **Column 3**: Selected numbers are -1. Product = -1 (not valid, need adjustment).\n\nWe need to adjust our selection to ensure all products are positive. Let's try a different combination:\n\n- Start with (0,3) = -1.\n- Select (0,0) = 8, (1,1) = 8, (1,2) = -3, (2,0) = 4, and (3,0) = 8.\n\nNow, let's verify the product condition for each row and column:\n\n- **Row 0**: Selected numbers are 8, -1. Product = 8 * (-1) = -8 (not valid, need adjustment).\n- **Row 1**: Selected numbers are 8, -3. Product = 8 * (-3) = -24 (not valid, need adjustment).\n- **Row 2**: Selected numbers are 4. Product = 4 (valid).\n- **Row 3**: Selected numbers are 8. Product = 8 (valid).\n\n- **Column 0**: Selected numbers are 8, 4, 8. Product = 8 * 4 * 8 = 256 (valid).\n- **Column 1**: Selected numbers are 8. Product = 8 (valid).\n- **Column 2**: Selected numbers are -3. Product = -3 (not valid, need adjustment).\n- **Column 3**: Selected numbers are -1. Product = -1 (not valid, need adjustment).\n\nLet's try another combination:\n\n- Start with (0,3) = -1.\n- Select (0,0) = 8, (1,0) = 1, (1,1) = 8, (2,0) = 4, and (3,0) = 8.\n\nNow, let's verify the product condition for each row and column:\n\n- **Row 0**: Selected numbers are 8, -1.
