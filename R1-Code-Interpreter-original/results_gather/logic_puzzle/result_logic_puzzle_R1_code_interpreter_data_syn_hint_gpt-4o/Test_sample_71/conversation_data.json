    "To solve this problem, we need to select 10 different numbers from the given 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0.

We need to select 10 numbers, ensuring that the product of numbers in each row and column is positive.\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - The product of numbers in each row and column must be positive.\n   - We must use the number 7 at position (0,4).\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Since the product must be positive, we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n   - We can start by selecting the number 7 at (0,4) and then strategically select other numbers to satisfy the constraints.\n\n4. **Selection Process**:\n   - We will start by selecting the number 7 at (0,4).\n   - We will then select numbers from each row and column, ensuring that the product remains positive.\n\nLet's implement a solution using Python to find a valid selection of numbers.\n\n```python\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [-8, 5, -9, 6, 7],\n    [10, -7, 3, 9, 9],\n    [-2, 7, -5, 10, 1],\n    [4, 9, 6, -5, 1],\n    [7, 9, 3, 7, 5]\n]\n\n# Start with the given number 7 at position (0,4)\nselected_positions = [(0, 4)]\n\n# Function to check if the product of selected numbers in a row or column is positive\ndef is_product_positive(selected_positions, grid):\n    # Check rows\n    for i in range(5):\n        product = 1\n        for j in range(5):\n            if (i, j) in selected_positions:\n                product *= grid[i][j]\n        if product <= 0:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check columns\n    for j in range(5):\n        product = 1\n        for i in range(5):\n            if (i, j) in selected_positions:\n                product *= grid[i][j]\n        if product <= 0:\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# Try to select 10 numbers\ndef select_numbers(grid, selected_positions):\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(5):\n            if (i, j) not in selected_positions:\n                selected_positions.append((i, j))\n                if len(selected_positions) == 10 and is_product_positive(selected_positions, grid):\n                    return selected_positions\n                elif len(selected_positions) < 10:\n                    result = select_numbers(grid, selected_positions)\n                    if result:\n                        return result\n                selected_positions.pop()\n    return None\n\n# Find the solution\nsolution = select_numbers(grid, selected_positions)\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(solution)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to find a valid selection of 10 numbers from the grid that satisfies the given constraints.
