  "question": "Given a 2*2 grid where each cell contains a number (between 1 to 3), you must select 3 different numbers from these cells. The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column should be less than or equal to 4. The numbers in the same row are separated by ',', and the coordinate system uses the top-left cell as the coordinate (1,1), with the horizontal coordinate under the top-left cell increasing and the vertical coordinate to the right of the top-left cell increasing.\nUsing the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) as the first selected number\n1, 2\n3, 1\n\nReturn your answer with the format <<<list of selected number positions>>>, where each position is given as row column (0-based indices). For example, <<<0 3, 1 0, 2 4>>> means numbers selected are at positions (0,3), (1,0), and (2,4).",

    "To solve this problem, we need to select three different numbers from the given 2x2 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) is already selected.\n\nThe grid is as follows:\n\n```\n1, 2\n3, 1\n```\n\nThe coordinates for each cell are:\n- (0,0): 1\n- (0,1): 2\n- (1,0): 3\n- (1,1): 1\n\nWe have already selected the number 2 at position (0,1). Now, we need to select two more numbers from the remaining cells: (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1).\n\nLet's analyze the possible selections:\n\n1. If we select the number at (0,0) which is 1:\n   - Row 0 sum: 1 + 2 = 3 (valid)\n   - Column 0 sum: 1 (valid)\n\n2. If we select the number at (1,0) which is 3:\n   - Row 1 sum: 3 (valid)\n   - Column 0 sum: 1 + 3 = 4 (valid)\n\n3. If we select the number at (1,1) which is 1:\n   - Row 1 sum: 1 (valid)\n   - Column 1 sum: 2 + 1 = 3 (valid)\n\nWe need to select two more numbers such that the sum in each row and column is less than or equal to 4. Let's try selecting (0,0) and (1,1):\n\n- Selected numbers: (0,1), (0,0), (1,1)\n- Row 0 sum: 1 + 2 = 3 (valid)\n- Row 1 sum: 1 (valid)\n- Column 0 sum: 1 (valid)\n- Column 1 sum: 2 + 1 = 3 (valid)\n\nThis selection satisfies all the conditions. Therefore, the selected positions are (0,1), (0,0), and (1,1).\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 1, 0 0, 1 1>>>"
