    "To solve this problem, we need to select 10 different numbers from the given 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 5 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial Selection**: We start with the number 5 at position (0,4).\n\n2. **Constraints**: \n   - We need to select 10 different numbers.\n   - The product of selected numbers in each row and column must be greater than 0.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - We need to ensure that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive. This means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column or all positive numbers.\n   - We should carefully choose numbers to maintain the balance of positive and negative numbers.\n\n4. **Approach**:\n   - Start with the given number and try to select numbers in a way that maintains the product constraint.\n   - We can use a greedy approach to select numbers row by row or column by column, ensuring the constraints are met.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find a valid selection of numbers.\n\n```python\n# Given grid\ngrid = [\n    [10, 8, 3, -9, 5],\n    [-2, 5, 7, 10, 2],\n    [9, 6, 4, -4, 9],\n    [4, 4, -6, 4, 1],\n    [8, -9, -9, 10, 4]\n]\n\n# Start with the given number at (0,4)\nselected_positions = [(0, 4)]\n\n# Function to check if the product of selected numbers in a row or column is positive\ndef is_product_positive(selected_positions, grid):\n    row_products = [1] * 5\n    col_products = [1] * 5\n    for r, c in selected_positions:\n        row_products[r] *= grid[r][c]\n        col_products[c] *= grid[r][c]\n    return all(p > 0 for p in row_products) and all(p > 0 for p in col_products)\n\n# Try to select 10 numbers\nfor r in range(5):\n    for c in range(5):\n        if (r, c) not in selected_positions:\n            selected_positions.append((r, c))\n            if len(selected_positions) == 10:\n                if is_product_positive(selected_positions, grid):\n                    break\n                else:\n                    selected_positions.pop()\n    if len(selected_positions) == 10:\n        break\n\n# Output the selected positions\nprint(selected_positions)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to select 10 numbers from the grid, starting with the given number, and ensure that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive.

    "The previous attempts have not been successful in finding a valid solution.

We can select 10, 8, and 3 at (0,0), (0,1), and (0,2) to ensure a positive product.\n- **Row 1**: We can select 5, 7, and 10 at (1,1), (1,2), and (1,3) to ensure a positive product.\n- **Row 2**: We can select 9 and 6 at (2,0) and (2,1) to ensure a positive product.\n- **Row 3**: We can select 4 and 4 at (3,0) and (3,1) to ensure a positive product.\n- **Row 4**: We can select 8 and 10 at (4,0) and (4,3) to ensure a positive product.\n\nNow, let's check the columns:\n\n- **Column 0**: We have 10, 9, 4, and 8, which gives a positive product.\n- **Column 1**: We have 8, 5, 6, and 4, which gives a positive product.\n- **Column 2**: We have 3, 7, and 4, which gives a positive product.\n- **Column 3**: We have 10 and 10, which gives a positive product.\n- **Column 4**: We have 5, which is already positive.\n\nBased on this analysis, a valid selection of positions is:\n- (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,4)\n- (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)\n- (2,0), (2,1)\n- (3,0), (3,1)\n- (4,0), (4,3)\n\nThis selection ensures that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive.\n\n<<<'answer'>>>"
