    "To solve this problem, we need to select 9 different numbers from the given 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are also given that the number 7 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Constraints**:\n   - We need to select 9 numbers.\n   - The product of numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers must be positive.\n   - The number 7 at position (0,4) is already selected.\n\n2. **Grid Analysis**:\n   - The grid is:\n     ```\n     3, 1, -1, -6, 7\n     7, -4, -3, 1, 6\n     1, 3, -2, 5, 3\n     6, 8, -7, -8, 5\n     1, 4, 5, 1, -7\n     ```\n   - We need to ensure that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive. This means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Start with the given number 7 at (0,4).\n   - Select numbers such that each row and column of the selected numbers has an even number of negative numbers.\n   - Ensure that the total count of selected numbers is 9.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - We will manually select numbers based on the constraints and verify the conditions.\n\nLet's proceed with selecting the numbers:\n\n- Start with (0,4) which is 7.\n- Select (0,0) which is 3, (0,1) which is 1, and (0,2) which is -1. This gives us a positive product for row 0.\n- Select (1,0) which is 7, (1,3) which is 1. This gives us a positive product for row 1.\n- Select (2,1) which is 3, (2,3) which is 5. This gives us a positive product for row 2.\n- Select (3,0) which is 6, (3,1) which is 8. This gives us a positive product for row 3.\n\nNow, let's verify the column products:\n- Column 0: 3, 7, 6 (positive product)\n- Column 1: 1, 3, 8 (positive product)\n- Column 2: -1 (no other selected number, so product is positive by default)\n- Column 3: 1, 5 (positive product)\n- Column 4: 7 (no other selected number, so product is positive by default)\n\nWe have selected 9 numbers and all row and column products are positive.\n\nThe selected positions are:\n- (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,4)\n- (1,0), (1,3)\n- (2,1), (2,3)\n- (3,0), (3,1)\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n<<<0 0, 0 1, 0 2, 0 4, 1 0, 1 3, 2 1, 2 3, 3 0>>>"
