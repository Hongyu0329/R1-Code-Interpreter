    "To solve this problem, we need to select 4 different numbers from the given 3x3 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) is already selected.\n\nLet's break down the grid and the constraints:\n\nGrid:\n```\n2, 1, 2\n3, 1, 4\n3, 2, 3\n```\n\nConstraints:\n1. We must select 4 different numbers.\n2. The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column should be ≤ 4.\n3. The number 2 at position (0,2) is already selected.\n\nNow, let's analyze the grid and try to find a combination of numbers that satisfies these constraints.\n\n- The number at (0,2) is 2, which is already selected.\n- We need to select 3 more numbers from the grid.\n\nLet's consider the possible selections:\n\n1. From the first row, we can select the number 1 at (0,1) because selecting another 2 at (0,0) would violate the constraint of selecting different numbers.\n2. From the second row, we can select the number 1 at (1,1).\n3. From the third row, we can select the number 2 at (2,1).\n\nLet's verify if this selection satisfies the constraints:\n\n- Row 0: Selected numbers are 1 (at 0,1) and 2 (at 0,2). Sum = 1 + 2 = 3 ≤ 4.\n- Row 1: Selected number is 1 (at 1,1). Sum = 1 ≤ 4.\n- Row 2: Selected number is 2 (at 2,1). Sum = 2 ≤ 4.\n\n- Column 0: No numbers selected. Sum = 0 ≤ 4.\n- Column 1: Selected numbers are 1 (at 0,1), 1 (at 1,1), and 2 (at 2,1). Sum = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 ≤ 4.\n- Column 2: Selected number is 2 (at 0,2). Sum = 2 ≤ 4.\n\nAll constraints are satisfied with this selection.\n\nTherefore, the selected positions are (0,1), (0,2), (1,1), and (2,1).\n\n<<<0 1, 0 2, 1 1, 2 1>>>"
