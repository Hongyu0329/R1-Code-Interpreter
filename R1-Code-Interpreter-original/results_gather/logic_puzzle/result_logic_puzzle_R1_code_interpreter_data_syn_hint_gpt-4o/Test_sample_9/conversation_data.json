The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column should be less than or equal to 4.

    "To solve this problem, we need to select three different numbers from the given 2x2 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 3 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) is already selected.\n\nThe grid is as follows:\n\n```\n1, 3\n3, 2\n```\n\nThe coordinates for each cell are:\n- (0,0): 1\n- (0,1): 3\n- (1,0): 3\n- (1,1): 2\n\nWe need to select two more numbers from the remaining cells (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1) such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and column is less than or equal to 4.\n\nLet's analyze the possibilities:\n\n1. We have already selected the number 3 at (0,1).\n2. We need to select two more numbers from the remaining cells: (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1).\n\nLet's consider the possible selections:\n\n- If we select the number at (0,0) which is 1, the sum for row 0 will be 1 + 3 = 4, which is valid.\n- If we select the number at (1,1) which is 2, the sum for column 1 will be 3 + 2 = 5, which is invalid.\n- If we select the number at (1,0) which is 3, the sum for column 0 will be 1 + 3 = 4, which is valid.\n\nTherefore, the valid selection is:\n- (0,0): 1\n- (0,1): 3 (already selected)\n- (1,0): 3\n\nThis selection satisfies the condition that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and column is less than or equal to 4.\n\nThus, the selected positions are (0,1), (0,0), and (1,0).\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 1, 0 0, 1 0>>>"
