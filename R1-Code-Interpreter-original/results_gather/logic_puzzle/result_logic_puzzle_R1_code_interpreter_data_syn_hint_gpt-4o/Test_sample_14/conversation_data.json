    "To solve this problem, we need to select three different numbers from the given 2x2 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 1 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) is already selected.\n\nThe grid is as follows:\n\n```\n2, 1\n3, 1\n```\n\nThe coordinates for each cell are:\n- (0,0): 2\n- (0,1): 1 (already selected)\n- (1,0): 3\n- (1,1): 1\n\nWe need to select two more numbers from the remaining cells: (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1).\n\nLet's analyze the possible selections:\n\n1. We have already selected the number 1 at (0,1).\n2. We need to select two more numbers from the remaining cells: (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1).\n\nLet's consider the possible combinations:\n\n- If we select (0,0) and (1,0):\n  - Row 0 sum: 2 (from (0,0)) + 1 (from (0,1)) = 3\n  - Row 1 sum: 3 (from (1,0))\n  - Column 0 sum: 2 (from (0,0)) + 3 (from (1,0)) = 5 (exceeds 4)\n  - Column 1 sum: 1 (from (0,1))\n\n- If we select (0,0) and (1,1):\n  - Row 0 sum: 2 (from (0,0)) + 1 (from (0,1)) = 3\n  - Row 1 sum: 1 (from (1,1))\n  - Column 0 sum: 2 (from (0,0))\n  - Column 1 sum: 1 (from (0,1)) + 1 (from (1,1)) = 2\n\n- If we select (1,0) and (1,1):\n  - Row 0 sum: 1 (from (0,1))\n  - Row 1 sum: 3 (from (1,0)) + 1 (from (1,1)) = 4\n  - Column 0 sum: 3 (from (1,0))\n  - Column 1 sum: 1 (from (0,1)) + 1 (from (1,1)) = 2\n\nThe combination (0,0) and (1,1) satisfies the condition that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4.\n\nTherefore, the selected positions are (0,1), (0,0), and (1,1).\n\n<<<0 1, 0 0, 1 1>>>"
