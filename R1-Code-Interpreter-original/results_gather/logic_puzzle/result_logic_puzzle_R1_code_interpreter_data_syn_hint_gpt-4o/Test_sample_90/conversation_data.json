    "To solve this problem, we need to select 12 different numbers from the given 6x6 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number -10 at position (0,5) is already selected.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial Selection**: We start with the number -10 at position (0,5).\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - We need to select 12 numbers in total.\n   - The product of selected numbers in each row and column must be greater than 0. This implies that the product must be positive, which means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - We need to ensure that each row and column with selected numbers has an even number of negative numbers.\n   - We will start by selecting numbers that help balance the negatives in the row and column of the initial selection.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - We will iterate through the grid and select numbers while keeping track of the count of negative numbers in each row and column.\n   - We will ensure that the total number of selected numbers is 12.\n\nLet's implement this strategy using Python code to find a valid selection of numbers.\n\n```python\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [6, 1, 5, -9, 3, -10],\n    [-9, -4, -9, 2, 7, 11],\n    [9, -8, 6, 12, 12, -2],\n    [9, -2, 11, -6, 8, 12],\n    [4, 1, 2, -2, -5, 10],\n    [3, -5, 6, -1, 9, 12]\n]\n\n# Initial selection\nselected_positions = [(0, 5)]\nselected_numbers = [-10]\n\n# Function to check if the product of selected numbers in a row or column is positive\ndef is_product_positive(selected_positions, grid):\n    row_neg_count = [0] * 6\n    col_neg_count = [0] * 6\n    \n    for r, c in selected_positions:\n        if grid[r][c] < 0:\n            row_neg_count[r] += 1\n            col_neg_count[c] += 1\n    \n    for count in row_neg_count + col_neg_count:\n        if count % 2 != 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Try to select 12 numbers\nfor r in range(6):\n    for c in range(6):\n        if (r, c) not in selected_positions:\n            selected_positions.append((r, c))\n            selected_numbers.append(grid[r][c])\n            if len(selected_positions) == 12 and is_product_positive(selected_positions, grid):\n                break\n            if len(selected_positions) > 12 or not is_product_positive(selected_positions, grid):\n                selected_positions.pop()\n                selected_numbers.pop()\n    if len(selected_positions) == 12:\n        break\n\n# Output the selected positions\nprint(', '.join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in selected_positions))\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to find a valid selection of 12 numbers from the grid that satisfies the given conditions.

    "The previous approach was too simplistic and did not effectively handle the constraints of ensuring an even number of negative numbers in each row and column. Let's rethink the strategy:\n\n1. **Initial Selection**: We start with the number -10 at position (0,5).\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - We need to select 12 numbers in total.\n   - The product of selected numbers in each row and column must be greater than 0, meaning an even number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n\n3. **Revised Strategy**:\n   - We will use a backtracking approach to explore possible selections of numbers.\n   - We will keep track of the number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n   - We will ensure that the total number of selected numbers is 12 and that the product condition is satisfied.\n\nLet's implement this revised strategy using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [6, 1, 5, -9, 3, -10],\n    [-9, -4, -9, 2, 7, 11],\n    [9, -8, 6, 12, 12, -2],\n    [9, -2, 11, -6, 8, 12],\n    [4, 1, 2, -2, -5, 10],\n    [3, -5, 6, -1, 9, 12]\n]\n\n# Initial selection\nselected_positions = [(0, 5)]\nselected_numbers = [-10]\n\n# Function to check if the product of selected numbers in a row or column is positive\ndef is_product_positive(selected_positions, grid):\n    row_neg_count = [0] * 6\n    col_neg_count = [0] * 6\n    \n    for r, c in selected_positions:\n        if grid[r][c] < 0:\n            row_neg_count[r] += 1\n            col_neg_count[c] += 1\n    \n    for count in row_neg_count + col_neg_count:\n        if count % 2 != 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Backtracking function to find a valid selection\ndef find_selection(selected_positions, grid):\n    if len(selected_positions) == 12:\n        if is_product_positive(selected_positions, grid):\n            return selected_positions\n        else:\n            return None\n    \n    for r in range(6):\n        for c in range(6):\n            if (r, c) not in selected_positions:\n                selected_positions.append((r, c))\n                if is_product_positive(selected_positions, grid):\n                    result = find_selection(selected_positions, grid)\n                    if result is not None:\n                        return result\n                selected_positions.pop()\n    return None\n\n# Find a valid selection\nresult = find_selection(selected_positions, grid)\n\n# Output the selected positions\nif result:\n    print(', '.join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in result))\nelse:\n    print(\"No valid selection found\")\n```\n\nThis code uses a backtracking approach to explore possible selections of numbers and checks if the product condition is satisfied. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The previous approach using backtracking did not yield a valid selection, indicating that the constraints were not properly managed. Let's switch to a more structured reasoning approach to identify a valid selection strategy.\n\n### Textual Reasoning\n\n1. **Initial Selection**: We have the number -10 at position (0,5). This means the first row and the last column each have one negative number.\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - We need to select 12 numbers in total.\n   - The product of selected numbers in each row and column must be positive, implying an even number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - We need to balance the negative numbers across the rows and columns.\n   - Since we have already selected a negative number in the first row and last column, we need to select another negative number in these to make the product positive.\n   - We should aim to select numbers such that each row and column has an even number of negative numbers.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - We will manually select numbers to ensure the constraints are met.\n   - We will start by selecting numbers that balance the negatives in the first row and last column.\n\nLet's manually select numbers based on this reasoning:\n\n- **Row 0**: Already has -10 at (0,5). We need another negative number, select -9 at (0,3).\n- **Row 1**: Select -9 at (1,0) and 11 at (1,5).\n- **Row 2**: Select 9 at (2,0) and 12 at (2,3).\n- **Row 3**: Select 9 at (3,0) and 12 at (3,5).\n- **Row 4**: Select 4 at (4,0) and 10 at (4,5).\n- **Row 5**: Select 3 at (5,0) and 12 at (5,5).\n\nThis selection ensures that each row and column has an even number of negative numbers, satisfying the product condition.\n\nThe selected positions are:\n- (0,3), (0,5)\n- (1,0), (1,5)\n- (2,0), (2,3)\n- (3,0), (3,5)\n- (4,0), (4,5)\n- (5,0), (5,5)\n\nLet's format this as the final answer.\n\n<<<0 3, 0 5, 1 0, 1 5, 2 0, 2 3, 3 0, 3 5, 4 0, 4 5, 5 0, 5 5>>>"
