    "To solve this problem, we need to select 6 different numbers from the given 4x4 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number at position (0,3) is already selected.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**: \n   - The grid is:\n     ```\n     8, 4, 5, 1\n     1, -4, -1, 4\n     -5, -3, 7, 6\n     4, 1, 7, 5\n     ```\n   - The number at position (0,3) is 1, which is already selected.\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - We need to select 6 numbers in total.\n   - The product of selected numbers in each row and column must be greater than 0.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Since the product must be positive, we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n   - We will start by selecting numbers that ensure the product condition is met.\n\n4. **Selection Process**:\n   - We already have (0,3) selected.\n   - We need to select 5 more numbers.\n   - We will try to balance the selection of positive and negative numbers to ensure the product is positive.\n\nLet's proceed with the selection:\n\n- **Row 0**: We have 1 at (0,3). We can select 8 at (0,0) and 4 at (0,1) to ensure a positive product.\n- **Row 1**: We can select 1 at (1,0) and 4 at (1,3) to ensure a positive product.\n- **Row 2**: We can select 7 at (2,2) and 6 at (2,3) to ensure a positive product.\n- **Row 3**: We can select 4 at (3,0) and 5 at (3,3) to ensure a positive product.\n\nNow, let's check the columns:\n\n- **Column 0**: We have 8 at (0,0), 1 at (1,0), and 4 at (3,0). The product is positive.\n- **Column 1**: We have 4 at (0,1). We need to ensure the product is positive, so we can select 1 at (3,1).\n- **Column 2**: We have 7 at (2,2). We need to ensure the product is positive, so we can select 5 at (0,2).\n- **Column 3**: We have 1 at (0,3), 4 at (1,3), and 6 at (2,3). The product is positive.\n\nLet's finalize the selection:\n\n- Selected positions: (0,0), (0,1), (0,3), (1,0), (1,3), (2,2)\n\nNow, let's format the answer:\n\n<<<0 0, 0 1, 0 3, 1 0, 1 3, 2 2>>>"
