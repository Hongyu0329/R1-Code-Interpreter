  "question": "Given a 4*4 grid where each cell contains a number (between -5 to 8), you must select 6 different numbers from these cells. The product of each row and column of the selected number must be greater than 0. The numbers in the same row are separated by ',', and the coordinate system uses the top-left cell as the coordinate (1,1), with the horizontal coordinate under the top-left cell increasing and the vertical coordinate to the right of the top-left cell increasing.\nUsing the number 8 in the top-rightmost square (0,3) as the first selected number\n-3, -4, 3, 8\n2, 3, 1, -2\n3, -1, -5, 5\n-2, 3, 6, -3\n\nReturn your answer with the format <<<list of selected number positions>>>, where each position is given as row column (0-based indices). For example, <<<0 3, 1 0, 2 4>>> means numbers selected are at positions (0,3), (1,0), and (2,4).",

    "To solve this problem, we need to select 6 different numbers from the given 4x4 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 8 at position (0,3) is already selected.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Constraints**: \n   - We need to select 6 numbers.\n   - The product of numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers must be greater than 0.\n   - The number 8 at position (0,3) is already selected.\n\n2. **Grid Analysis**:\n   ```\n   -3, -4,  3,  8\n    2,  3,  1, -2\n    3, -1, -5,  5\n   -2,  3,  6, -3\n   ```\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Since the product must be greater than 0, we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers.\n   - We already have a positive number (8) at (0,3).\n   - We need to carefully select the remaining numbers to ensure the product condition is satisfied.\n\n4. **Selection**:\n   - Start with the given number 8 at (0,3).\n   - Choose numbers such that each row and column has an even number of negative numbers or all positive numbers.\n\nLet's try to find a valid selection:\n\n- Select (0,3): 8 (positive)\n- Select (0,2): 3 (positive)\n- Select (1,0): 2 (positive)\n- Select (1,1): 3 (positive)\n- Select (2,0): 3 (positive)\n- Select (3,2): 6 (positive)\n\nNow, let's verify:\n\n- Row 0: 3, 8 (positive product)\n- Row 1: 2, 3 (positive product)\n- Row 2: 3 (positive product)\n- Row 3: 6 (positive product)\n\n- Column 0: 2, 3 (positive product)\n- Column 1: 3 (positive product)\n- Column 2: 3, 6 (positive product)\n- Column 3: 8 (positive product)\n\nAll rows and columns have a positive product, satisfying the condition.\n\nTherefore, the selected positions are:\n- (0,3), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (3,2)\n\nThe final answer is:\n<<<0 3, 0 2, 1 0, 1 1, 2 0, 3 2>>>"
