    "To solve this problem, we need to select 10 different numbers from the given 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial Selection**: We start with the number 2 at position (0,4).\n\n2. **Constraints**: \n   - We need to select 10 different numbers.\n   - The product of selected numbers in each row and column must be greater than 0. This implies that each row and column with selected numbers must have an even number of negative numbers or no negative numbers at all.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - We will try to select numbers such that the product condition is satisfied.\n   - We will ensure that we have a balanced number of negative numbers in each row and column where we select numbers.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - We will iterate over the grid and select numbers while keeping track of the number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n   - We will ensure that the total number of selected numbers is 10.\n\nLet's implement this strategy using Python code to find a valid selection of numbers.\n\n```python\ngrid = [\n    [2, -6, -10, 1, 2],\n    [-3, 2, 7, -3, 6],\n    [3, 7, 4, 9, 1],\n    [-4, 4, 3, 7, 7],\n    [8, 4, 3, 5, 10]\n]\n\n# Start with the given number\nselected_positions = [(0, 4)]\nselected_numbers = [2]\n\n# Function to check if adding a number keeps the product positive\ndef is_valid_selection(selected_positions, new_position):\n    row_counts = [0] * 5\n    col_counts = [0] * 5\n    for r, c in selected_positions:\n        if grid[r][c] < 0:\n            row_counts[r] += 1\n            col_counts[c] += 1\n    r, c = new_position\n    if grid[r][c] < 0:\n        row_counts[r] += 1\n        col_counts[c] += 1\n    # Check if any row or column has an odd number of negatives\n    for count in row_counts + col_counts:\n        if count % 2 != 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Try to select 9 more numbers\nfor r in range(5):\n    for c in range(5):\n        if (r, c) not in selected_positions:\n            if is_valid_selection(selected_positions, (r, c)):\n                selected_positions.append((r, c))\n                selected_numbers.append(grid[r][c])\n                if len(selected_positions) == 10:\n                    break\n    if len(selected_positions) == 10:\n        break\n\n# Output the selected positions\nprint(selected_positions)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to select 10 numbers from the grid while ensuring the product condition is met.
