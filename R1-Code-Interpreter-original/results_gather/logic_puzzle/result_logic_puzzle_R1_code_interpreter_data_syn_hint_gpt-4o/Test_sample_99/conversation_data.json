    "To solve this problem, we need to select 16 different numbers from the given 7x7 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 8 in the top-rightmost square (0,6) is the first selected number.\n\nThe key points to consider are:\n1. We need to ensure that the product of numbers in each row and column is positive. This means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n2. We need to select exactly 16 numbers, which means we will have 4 rows and 4 columns with selected numbers.\n3. We need to carefully choose numbers to maintain the balance of positive and negative numbers.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the grid and selecting numbers:\n\n```\nGrid:\n13, -5, -8, 5, -11, 11, 8\n9, 4, -14, 3, 3, 12, 5\n3, 3, -5, 9, 11, 5, 10\n6, 10, 3, -2, 7, 14, 6\n6, 7, -2, -14, -1, 10, 7\n1, -10, 6, 13, 6, -10, 10\n-8, -13, 9, 6, 8, 3, 1\n```\n\nWe start with the number 8 at position (0,6). We need to select 15 more numbers.\n\nTo ensure the product of each row and column is positive, we can try to select numbers such that each row and column has an even number of negative numbers. We can also try to balance the number of positive and negative numbers.\n\nLet's try to select numbers manually:\n\n1. Start with (0,6) = 8\n2. Select (0,0) = 13, (0,3) = 5, (0,5) = 11\n3. Select (1,1) = 4, (1,3) = 3, (1,5) = 12\n4. Select (2,0) = 3, (2,3) = 9, (2,6) = 10\n5. Select (3,1) = 10, (3,4) = 7\n6. Select (4,0) = 6, (4,5) = 10\n7. Select (5,2) = 6, (5,4) = 6\n\nNow, let's check if the product of each row and column is positive:\n\n- Row 0: 13, 5, 11, 8 (Product = positive)\n- Row 1: 4, 3, 12 (Product = positive)\n- Row 2: 3, 9, 10 (Product = positive)\n- Row 3: 10, 7 (Product = positive)\n- Row 4: 6, 10 (Product = positive)\n- Row 5: 6, 6 (Product = positive)\n\n- Column 0: 13, 3, 6 (Product = positive)\n- Column 1: 4, 10 (Product = positive)\n- Column 2: 6 (Product = positive)\n- Column 3: 5, 3, 9 (Product = positive)\n- Column 4: 7, 6 (Product = positive)\n- Column 5: 11, 12, 10 (Product = positive)\n- Column 6: 8, 10 (Product = positive)\n\nAll products are positive, and we have selected 16 numbers.\n\nThe selected positions are:\n- (0,0), (0,3), (0,5), (0,6)\n- (1,1), (1,3), (1,5)\n- (2,0), (2,3), (2,6)\n- (3,1), (3,4)\n- (4,0), (4,5)\n- (5,2), (5,4)\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 0, 0 3, 0 5, 0 6, 1 1, 1 3, 1 5, 2 0, 2 3, 2 6, 3 1, 3 4, 4 0, 4 5, 5 2, 5 4>>>"
