    "To solve this problem, we need to select three different numbers from the given 2x2 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) is already selected.\n\nThe grid is as follows:\n\n```\n1, 2\n3, 2\n```\n\nLet's denote the grid with coordinates:\n\n```\n(0,0) -> 1\n(0,1) -> 2\n(1,0) -> 3\n(1,1) -> 2\n```\n\nWe have already selected the number at (0,1), which is 2. Now, we need to select two more numbers from the remaining cells: (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1).\n\nLet's consider the constraints:\n1. The sum of the selected numbers in each row should be ≤ 4.\n2. The sum of the selected numbers in each column should be ≤ 4.\n\nWe can start by selecting the number at (0,0), which is 1. This gives us:\n\n- Row 0: 1 + 2 = 3 (satisfies the constraint)\n- Column 0: 1 (satisfies the constraint)\n\nNow, we need to select one more number from the remaining cells: (1,0) or (1,1).\n\nIf we select the number at (1,0), which is 3, we have:\n\n- Row 1: 3 (satisfies the constraint)\n- Column 0: 1 + 3 = 4 (satisfies the constraint)\n- Column 1: 2 (satisfies the constraint)\n\nThis selection satisfies all the constraints. Therefore, the selected numbers are at positions (0,1), (0,0), and (1,0).\n\nLet's format the answer as required:\n\n<<<0 1, 0 0, 1 0>>>"
