    "To solve this problem, we need to select 12 different numbers from the given 6x6 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number -9 in the top-rightmost square (0,5) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**: We have a 6x6 grid with numbers ranging from -10 to 12. We need to select 12 numbers, ensuring that the product of numbers in each row and column is positive.\n\n2. **Constraints**: \n   - The product of numbers in each row and column must be greater than 0. This implies that each row and column must have an even number of negative numbers or no negative numbers at all.\n   - We must include the number -9 at position (0,5).\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Start by including the given number -9 at position (0,5).\n   - Select additional numbers ensuring that each row and column has an even number of negative numbers.\n   - We need to carefully choose numbers to maintain the balance of positive and negative numbers.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - We will iterate over the grid and select numbers while keeping track of the count of negative numbers in each row and column.\n   - We will ensure that the selection of numbers satisfies the condition of having an even number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n\nLet's implement this strategy using Python code to find the positions of the selected numbers.\n\n```python\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [-7, 8, 9, 3, 2, -9],\n    [-5, -8, 6, 10, 12, 2],\n    [-4, 5, 12, 7, 6, 12],\n    [1, 7, 7, -2, -5, 6],\n    [-10, 6, -5, 9, 2, -8],\n    [10, -10, 2, 1, -1, -8]\n]\n\n# Initialize the selected positions with the given number\nselected_positions = [(0, 5)]\n\n# Function to check if a selection is valid\ndef is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n    row_neg_count = [0] * 6\n    col_neg_count = [0] * 6\n    \n    for r, c in selected_positions:\n        if grid[r][c] < 0:\n            row_neg_count[r] += 1\n            col_neg_count[c] += 1\n    \n    # Check if all rows and columns have even number of negatives\n    for count in row_neg_count + col_neg_count:\n        if count % 2 != 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Try to select 12 numbers\nfor r in range(6):\n    for c in range(6):\n        if (r, c) not in selected_positions:\n            selected_positions.append((r, c))\n            if len(selected_positions) == 12 and is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n                break\n            if len(selected_positions) > 12 or not is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n                selected_positions.pop()\n    if len(selected_positions) == 12:\n        break\n\n# Print the selected positions\nprint(selected_positions)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to select 12 numbers from the grid, ensuring that the product of numbers in each row and column is positive.

    "The previous attempt to solve the problem was not successful because it did not properly implement the logic to select 12 numbers while ensuring the product of numbers in each row and column is positive. Let's switch to a more structured approach to solve this problem.\n\n### Revised Approach:\n\n1. **Initial Selection**: Start with the given number -9 at position (0,5).\n\n2. **Selection Strategy**:\n   - We need to ensure that each row and column has an even number of negative numbers or no negative numbers at all.\n   - We will iterate over the grid and select numbers while keeping track of the count of negative numbers in each row and column.\n   - We will use a backtracking approach to explore possible selections and backtrack if a selection does not satisfy the conditions.\n\n3. **Backtracking**:\n   - Use a recursive function to try selecting numbers.\n   - If a selection leads to an invalid state (odd number of negatives in any row or column), backtrack and try a different selection.\n\nLet's implement this approach using Python code.\n\n```python\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [-7, 8, 9, 3, 2, -9],\n    [-5, -8, 6, 10, 12, 2],\n    [-4, 5, 12, 7, 6, 12],\n    [1, 7, 7, -2, -5, 6],\n    [-10, 6, -5, 9, 2, -8],\n    [10, -10, 2, 1, -1, -8]\n]\n\n# Initialize the selected positions with the given number\nselected_positions = [(0, 5)]\n\n# Function to check if a selection is valid\ndef is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n    row_neg_count = [0] * 6\n    col_neg_count = [0] * 6\n    \n    for r, c in selected_positions:\n        if grid[r][c] < 0:\n            row_neg_count[r] += 1\n            col_neg_count[c] += 1\n    \n    # Check if all rows and columns have even number of negatives\n    for count in row_neg_count + col_neg_count:\n        if count % 2 != 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Backtracking function to select numbers\ndef select_numbers(selected_positions, start_row, start_col):\n    if len(selected_positions) == 12:\n        return selected_positions if is_valid_selection(selected_positions) else None\n    \n    for r in range(start_row, 6):\n        for c in range(start_col if r == start_row else 0, 6):\n            if (r, c) not in selected_positions:\n                selected_positions.append((r, c))\n                result = select_numbers(selected_positions, r, c + 1)\n                if result:\n                    return result\n                selected_positions.pop()\n    return None\n\n# Start the selection process\nresult = select_numbers(selected_positions, 0, 0)\n\n# Print the selected positions\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code uses a backtracking approach to find a valid selection of 12 numbers.
