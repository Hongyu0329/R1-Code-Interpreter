  "question": "Given a 3*3 grid where each cell contains a number (between 1 to 4), you must select 4 different numbers from these cells. The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column should be less than or equal to 4. The numbers in the same row are separated by ',', and the coordinate system uses the top-left cell as the coordinate (1,1), with the horizontal coordinate under the top-left cell increasing and the vertical coordinate to the right of the top-left cell increasing.\nUsing the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) as the first selected number\n1, 3, 2\n4, 1, 3\n3, 3, 4\n\nReturn your answer with the format <<<list of selected number positions>>>, where each position is given as row column (0-based indices). For example, <<<0 3, 1 0, 2 4>>> means numbers selected are at positions (0,3), (1,0), and (2,4).",

    "To solve this problem, we need to select four different numbers from the 3x3 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) is already selected.\n\nLet's break down the grid:\n\n```\n1, 3, 2\n4, 1, 3\n3, 3, 4\n```\n\nThe coordinates for each cell are as follows:\n\n```\n(0,0), (0,1), (0,2)\n(1,0), (1,1), (1,2)\n(2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n```\n\nWe have already selected the number 2 at position (0,2). Now, we need to select three more numbers such that:\n\n1. The sum of the selected numbers in each row is ≤ 4.\n2. The sum of the selected numbers in each column is ≤ 4.\n3. All selected numbers are different.\n\nLet's start by considering the constraints:\n\n- Row 0: We have already selected 2 at (0,2). We can select 1 at (0,0) to keep the sum ≤ 4.\n- Row 1: We can select 1 at (1,1) to keep the sum ≤ 4.\n- Row 2: We can select 3 at (2,0) to keep the sum ≤ 4.\n\nNow, let's check the column constraints:\n\n- Column 0: We have selected 1 at (0,0) and 3 at (2,0). The sum is 4.\n- Column 1: We have selected 1 at (1,1). The sum is 1.\n- Column 2: We have selected 2 at (0,2). The sum is 2.\n\nAll constraints are satisfied, and all selected numbers are different.\n\nThe selected positions are (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), and (2,0).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 0, 0 2, 1 1, 2 0>>>"
