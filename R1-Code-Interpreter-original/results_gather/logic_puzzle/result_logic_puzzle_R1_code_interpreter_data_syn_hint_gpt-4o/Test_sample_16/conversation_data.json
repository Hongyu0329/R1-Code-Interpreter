The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column should be less than or equal to 4.

    "To solve this problem, we need to select four different numbers from the given 3x3 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 1 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) is already selected.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Grid Representation:**\n   ```\n   3, 3, 1\n   4, 3, 2\n   4, 4, 3\n   ```\n\n2. **Constraints:**\n   - We need to select four different numbers.\n   - The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column should be ≤ 4.\n   - The number at position (0,2) is already selected.\n\n3. **Initial Selection:**\n   - We have already selected the number 1 at position (0,2).\n\n4. **Strategy:**\n   - We need to select three more numbers from the grid.\n   - We should aim to select numbers that are 1 or 2, as these are the only numbers that can keep the sum ≤ 4 when combined with the number 1.\n\n5. **Possible Selections:**\n   - We can select the number 2 at position (1,2).\n   - We can select the number 1 at position (0,2) (already selected).\n   - We need to find two more numbers that are either 1 or 2.\n\n6. **Checking the Grid:**\n   - The grid has the following numbers:\n     - Row 0: 3, 3, 1\n     - Row 1: 4, 3, 2\n     - Row 2: 4, 4, 3\n\n7. **Selection Process:**\n   - We have already selected (0,2).\n   - We can select (1,2) which is 2.\n   - We need to find two more numbers that are either 1 or 2.\n\n8. **Final Selection:**\n   - We can select (0,2) which is 1.\n   - We can select (1,2) which is 2.\n   - We can select (0,0) which is 3.\n   - We can select (0,1) which is 3.\n\nLet's verify the selection:\n\n- Row 0: 1 (at 0,2) + 3 (at 0,0) + 3 (at 0,1) = 7 (not valid)\n- Row 1: 2 (at 1,2) = 2 (valid)\n- Row 2: No selection = 0 (valid)\n\n- Column 0: 3 (at 0,0) = 3 (valid)\n- Column 1: 3 (at 0,1) = 3 (valid)\n- Column 2: 1 (at 0,2) + 2 (at 1,2) = 3 (valid)\n\nThe selection is not valid as the sum in Row 0 exceeds 4. Let's try another approach:\n\n- Select (0,2) which is 1.\n- Select (1,2) which is 2.\n- Select (1,0) which is 4.\n- Select (2,0) which is 4.\n\nLet's verify this selection:\n\n- Row 0: 1 (at 0,2) = 1 (valid)\n- Row 1: 2 (at 1,2) + 4 (at 1,0) = 6 (not valid)\n- Row 2: 4 (at 2,0) = 4 (valid)\n\n- Column 0: 4 (at 1,0) + 4 (at 2,0) = 8 (not valid)\n- Column 1: No selection = 0 (valid)\n- Column 2: 1 (at 0,2) + 2 (at 1,2) = 3 (valid)\n\nThe selection is not valid as the sum in Row 1 and Column 0 exceeds 4.
