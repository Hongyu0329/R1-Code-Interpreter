    "To solve this problem, we need to select four different numbers from the given 3x3 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 1 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) is already selected.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Grid Representation:**\n   ```\n   2, 1, 1\n   4, 2, 3\n   3, 3, 3\n   ```\n\n2. **Selected Number:**\n   - The number 1 at position (0,2) is already selected.\n\n3. **Constraints:**\n   - We need to select four different numbers.\n   - The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column should be less than or equal to 4.\n\n4. **Approach:**\n   - We need to select three more numbers from the grid.\n   - We need to ensure that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and column is less than or equal to 4.\n   - We need to ensure that all selected numbers are different.\n\nLet's analyze the grid and try to find a solution:\n\n- The number 1 at (0,2) is already selected.\n- We need to select numbers such that the sum in each row and column is â‰¤ 4.\n\nLet's try to find a combination that satisfies these conditions:\n\n- Select 1 at (0,2)\n- Select 2 at (0,1)\n- Select 3 at (2,0)\n- Select 4 at (1,0)\n\nNow, let's check the sums:\n\n- Row 0: 2 + 1 = 3 (satisfies the condition)\n- Row 1: 4 (satisfies the condition)\n- Row 2: 3 (satisfies the condition)\n\n- Column 0: 3 + 4 = 7 (does not satisfy the condition)\n- Column 1: 2 (satisfies the condition)\n- Column 2: 1 (satisfies the condition)\n\nThe column 0 sum exceeds 4, so this selection does not work. Let's try another combination:\n\n- Select 1 at (0,2)\n- Select 2 at (0,1)\n- Select 3 at (2,1)\n- Select 4 at (1,0)\n\nNow, let's check the sums:\n\n- Row 0: 2 + 1 = 3 (satisfies the condition)\n- Row 1: 4 (satisfies the condition)\n- Row 2: 3 (satisfies the condition)\n\n- Column 0: 4 (satisfies the condition)\n- Column 1: 2 + 3 = 5 (does not satisfy the condition)\n- Column 2: 1 (satisfies the condition)\n\nThe column 1 sum exceeds 4, so this selection does not work. Let's try another combination:\n\n- Select 1 at (0,2)\n- Select 2 at (0,1)\n- Select 3 at (2,2)\n- Select 4 at (1,0)\n\nNow, let's check the sums:\n\n- Row 0: 2 + 1 = 3 (satisfies the condition)\n- Row 1: 4 (satisfies the condition)\n- Row 2: 3 (satisfies the condition)\n\n- Column 0: 4 (satisfies the condition)\n- Column 1: 2 (satisfies the condition)\n- Column 2: 1 + 3 = 4 (satisfies the condition)\n\nThis selection satisfies all the conditions. Therefore, the selected positions are:\n\n- (0,2)\n- (0,1)\n- (2,2)\n- (1,0)\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 2, 0 1, 2 2, 1 0>>>"
