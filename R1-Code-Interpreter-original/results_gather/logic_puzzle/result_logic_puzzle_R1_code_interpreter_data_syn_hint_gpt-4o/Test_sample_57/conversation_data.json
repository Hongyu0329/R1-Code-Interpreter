    "To solve this problem, we need to select 9 different numbers from the given 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 5 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Constraints**: \n   - We need to select 9 numbers.\n   - The product of numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers must be greater than 0.\n   - We must include the number at position (0,4).\n\n2. **Grid Analysis**:\n   - The grid is:\n     ```\n     8, 3, -8, -6, 5\n     -2, -7, 7, -3, 3\n     3, 2, 2, 8, -3\n     4, 5, -5, -2, -5\n     4, -4, -7, 5, 8\n     ```\n   - We need to ensure that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive. This means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Start with the given number at (0,4).\n   - Select numbers such that each row and column has an even number of negative numbers.\n   - Ensure that we have exactly 9 numbers selected.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - We will use a brute-force approach to try different combinations and check the conditions.\n   - We will use Python to automate the selection and checking process.\n\nLet's implement the code to find a valid selection of numbers.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [8, 3, -8, -6, 5],\n    [-2, -7, 7, -3, 3],\n    [3, 2, 2, 8, -3],\n    [4, 5, -5, -2, -5],\n    [4, -4, -7, 5, 8]\n]\n\n# Pre-select the given number\npre_selected = [(0, 4)]\n\n# Function to check if the product of numbers in each row and column is positive\ndef is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n    row_products = [1] * 5\n    col_products = [1] * 5\n    for r, c in selected_positions:\n        row_products[r] *= grid[r][c]\n        col_products[c] *= grid[r][c]\n    return all(p > 0 for p in row_products) and all(p > 0 for p in col_products)\n\n# Generate all possible combinations of 8 additional positions\nall_positions = [(r, c) for r in range(5) for c in range(5) if (r, c) != (0, 4)]\nfor additional_positions in combinations(all_positions, 8):\n    selected_positions = pre_selected + list(additional_positions)\n    if is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n        # Format the output as required\n        result = ', '.join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in selected_positions)\n        print(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n        break\n```\n\nThis code will find a valid selection of 9 numbers, including the pre-selected number at (0,4), and ensure that the product of numbers in each row and column is positive.
