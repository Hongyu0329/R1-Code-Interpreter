The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column should be less than or equal to 4.

    "To solve this problem, we need to select 4 different numbers from the given 3x3 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 1 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) is already selected.\n\nLet's break down the grid:\n\n```\n3, 4, 1\n4, 4, 2\n3, 3, 1\n```\n\nThe coordinates for each cell are as follows:\n\n- (0,0) = 3\n- (0,1) = 4\n- (0,2) = 1 (selected)\n- (1,0) = 4\n- (1,1) = 4\n- (1,2) = 2\n- (2,0) = 3\n- (2,1) = 3\n- (2,2) = 1\n\nWe need to select 3 more numbers such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and column is ≤ 4.\n\nLet's start by considering the constraints:\n\n1. Row 0: We have already selected 1 at (0,2). We can select 3 at (0,0) to make the sum 4.\n2. Row 1: We can select 2 at (1,2) to keep the sum ≤ 4.\n3. Row 2: We can select 1 at (2,2) to keep the sum ≤ 4.\n\nNow, let's check the column constraints:\n\n- Column 0: Selecting 3 at (0,0) and 1 at (2,2) gives a sum of 4.\n- Column 1: No numbers selected, so the sum is 0.\n- Column 2: We have selected 1 at (0,2) and 2 at (1,2), giving a sum of 3.\n\nAll constraints are satisfied. Therefore, the selected positions are:\n\n- (0,2) = 1 (given)\n- (0,0) = 3\n- (1,2) = 2\n- (2,2) = 1\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 2, 0 0, 1 2, 2 2>>>"
