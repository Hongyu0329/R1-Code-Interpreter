The product of each row and column of the selected number must be greater than 0.

    "To solve this problem, we need to select 6 different numbers from the given 4x4 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number at position (0,3) is already selected.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**: \n   - The grid is:\n     ```\n     6, -4, 2, 1\n     -5, 1, -5, -3\n     -4, 4, -1, 5\n     -1, 3, 1, -1\n     ```\n   - We need to select 6 numbers, and one of them is already selected at position (0,3) with the value 1.\n\n2. **Product Condition**:\n   - The product of numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers must be greater than 0. This implies that the product must be positive.\n\n3. **Selection Strategy**:\n   - Since the product must be positive, we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers.\n   - We already have a positive number (1) at (0,3). We need to select 5 more numbers.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - We will try to select numbers such that the product condition is satisfied for each row and column.\n   - We will use a combination of positive and negative numbers to ensure the product is positive.\n\nLet's write a Python script to find a valid selection of numbers:\n\n```python\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [6, -4, 2, 1],\n    [-5, 1, -5, -3],\n    [-4, 4, -1, 5],\n    [-1, 3, 1, -1]\n]\n\n# Pre-select the number at (0,3)\nselected_positions = [(0, 3)]\n\n# Function to check if the product of selected numbers in a row or column is positive\ndef is_product_positive(selected_positions, grid):\n    # Check rows\n    for i in range(4):\n        product = 1\n        for j in range(4):\n            if (i, j) in selected_positions:\n                product *= grid[i][j]\n        if product <= 0:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check columns\n    for j in range(4):\n        product = 1\n        for i in range(4):\n            if (i, j) in selected_positions:\n                product *= grid[i][j]\n        if product <= 0:\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# Try to select 5 more numbers\ndef find_selection(grid, selected_positions):\n    for i in range(4):\n        for j in range(4):\n            if (i, j) not in selected_positions:\n                selected_positions.append((i, j))\n                if len(selected_positions) == 6 and is_product_positive(selected_positions, grid):\n                    return selected_positions\n                elif len(selected_positions) < 6:\n                    result = find_selection(grid, selected_positions)\n                    if result:\n                        return result\n                selected_positions.pop()\n    return None\n\n# Find a valid selection\nresult = find_selection(grid, selected_positions)\n\n# Print the result\nif result:\n    print(\"<<<\" + \", \".join(f\"{i} {j}\" for i, j in result) + \">>>\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No valid selection found\")\n```\n\nThis script will attempt to find a valid selection of 6 numbers from the grid that satisfies the product condition for each row and column. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code execution result provided a valid selection of numbers from the grid that satisfies the condition of having a positive product for each row and column. However, let's verify the solution and ensure that it meets all the criteria.\n\n### Verification of the Solution:\n\n1. **Selected Positions**: \n   - The positions selected are: (0,3), (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,1), and (2,3).\n\n2. **Values at Selected Positions**:\n   - (0,3) = 1\n   - (0,0) = 6\n   - (0,2) = 2\n   - (1,1) = 1\n   - (2,1) = 4\n   - (2,3) = 5\n\n3. **Product Check**:\n   - **Row 0**: 6, 2, 1 (Product = 12, positive)\n   - **Row 1**: 1 (Product = 1, positive)\n   - **Row 2**: 4, 5 (Product = 20, positive)\n   - **Column 0**: 6 (Product = 6, positive)\n   - **Column 1**: 1, 4 (Product = 4, positive)\n   - **Column 2**: 2 (Product = 2, positive)\n   - **Column 3**: 1, 5 (Product = 5, positive)\n\nThe solution satisfies the condition that the product of numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0.\n\nSince the solution is valid, we can conclude with the final answer.\n\n<<<0 3, 0 0, 0 2, 1 1, 2 1, 2 3>>>"
