  "question": "Given a 5*5 grid where each cell contains a number (between -7 to 7), you must select 9 different numbers from these cells. The product of each row and column of the selected number must be greater than 0.

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to select 9 different numbers from the given 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number at position (0,4) is already selected.\n\nLet's analyze the grid and select numbers strategically to ensure that the product of each row and column is positive. We need to consider the signs of the numbers to ensure that the product is positive.\n\nHere's the grid for reference:\n\n```\n1, -4, -1, 5, 2\n-7, -6, 7, 4, 2\n-2, -5, 4, -1, 6\n-3, -4, -7, 4, 4\n1, -7, 6, 5, 6\n```\n\nLet's start by selecting the number at (0,4) and then choose additional numbers to satisfy the conditions. We'll aim to balance the number of negative and positive numbers in each row and column to ensure a positive product.\n\nLet's proceed with the selection:\nassistant > To ensure that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is positive, we need to carefully choose numbers such that the number of negative numbers in each row and column is even (including zero). We already have the number at position (0,4) selected, which is 2 (a positive number).\n\nLet's select the numbers step by step:\n\n1. **Row 0**: We have selected (0,4) which is 2. We need to select two more numbers. Let's choose (0,0) which is 1 (positive) and (0,3) which is 5 (positive). This gives us a positive product for row 0.\n\n2. **Row 1**: We need to select three numbers. Let's choose (1,2) which is 7 (positive), (1,3) which is 4 (positive), and (1,4) which is 2 (positive). This gives us a positive product for row 1.\n\n3. **Row 2**: We need to select one number. Let's choose (2,2) which is 4 (positive). This gives us a positive product for row 2.\n\n4. **Row 3**: We need to select two numbers. Let's choose (3,3) which is 4 (positive) and (3,4) which is 4 (positive). This gives us a positive product for row 3.\n\n5. **Row 4**: We need to select one number. Let's choose (4,2) which is 6 (positive). This gives us a positive product for row 4.\n\nNow, let's verify the columns:\n\n- **Column 0**: We have selected (0,0) which is 1 (positive).\n- **Column 1**: We have not selected any numbers from this column.\n- **Column 2**: We have selected (1,2) which is 7 (positive), (2,2) which is 4 (positive), and (4,2) which is 6 (positive).\n- **Column 3**: We have selected (0,3) which is 5 (positive), (1,3) which is 4 (positive), and (3,3) which is 4 (positive).\n- **Column 4**: We have selected (0,4) which is 2 (positive), (1,4) which is 2 (positive), and (3,4) which is 4 (positive).\n\nAll selected columns have a positive product.\n\nThe selected positions are:\n- (0,0), (0,3), (0,4)\n- (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)\n- (2,2)\n- (3,3), (3,4)\n- (4,2)\n\nLet's format the answer as requested: \n\n<<<0 0, 0 3, 0 4, 1 2, 1 3, 1 4, 2 2, 3 3, 3 4>>>"
