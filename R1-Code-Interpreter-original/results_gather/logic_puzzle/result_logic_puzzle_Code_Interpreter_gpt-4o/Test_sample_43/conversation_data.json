  "question": "Given a 4*4 grid where each cell contains a number (between -4 to 8), you must select 6 different numbers from these cells. The product of each row and column of the selected number must be greater than 0. The numbers in the same row are separated by ',', and the coordinate system uses the top-left cell as the coordinate (1,1), with the horizontal coordinate under the top-left cell increasing and the vertical coordinate to the right of the top-left cell increasing.\nUsing the number 6 in the top-rightmost square (0,3) as the first selected number\n7, -3, 5, 6\n6, 6, -3, 2\n4, 4, 5, -4\n2, 8, 8, 7\n\nReturn your answer with the format <<<list of selected number positions>>>, where each position is given as row column (0-based indices). For example, <<<0 3, 1 0, 2 4>>> means numbers selected are at positions (0,3), (1,0), and (2,4).",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to select 6 different numbers from the grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the first selected number is 6 at position (0,3).\n\nLet's analyze the grid:\n\n```\nRow 0: 7, -3, 5, 6\nRow 1: 6, 6, -3, 2\nRow 2: 4, 4, 5, -4\nRow 3: 2, 8, 8, 7\n```\n\nWe need to ensure that the product of the selected numbers in each row and column is positive. This means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers.\n\nLet's start by selecting the number at (0,3) and then choose the remaining numbers to satisfy the conditions. \n\n1. Select (0,3): 6 (positive)\n2. Select (1,0): 6 (positive)\n3. Select (2,0): 4 (positive)\n4. Select (3,0): 2 (positive)\n5. Select (3,1): 8 (positive)\n6. Select (3,3): 7 (positive)\n\nNow, let's verify the product conditions:\n\n- Row 0: Only one selected number (6), product = 6 (positive)\n- Row 1: Only one selected number (6), product = 6 (positive)\n- Row 2: Only one selected number (4), product = 4 (positive)\n- Row 3: Three selected numbers (2, 8, 7), product = 2 * 8 * 7 = 112 (positive)\n\n- Column 0: Four selected numbers (6, 4, 2), product = 6 * 4 * 2 = 48 (positive)\n- Column 1: One selected number (8), product = 8 (positive)\n- Column 3: Two selected numbers (6, 7), product = 6 * 7 = 42 (positive)\n\nAll products are positive, so this selection satisfies the conditions.\n\nThe selected positions are: (0,3), (1,0), (2,0), (3,0), (3,1), (3,3).\n\nThe answer in the required format is:\n\n<<<0 3, 1 0, 2 0, 3 0, 3 1, 3 3>>>"
