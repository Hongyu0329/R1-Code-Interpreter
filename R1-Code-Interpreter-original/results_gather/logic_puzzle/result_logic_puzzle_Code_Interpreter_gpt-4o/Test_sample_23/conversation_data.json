  "question": "Given a 3*3 grid where each cell contains a number (between 1 to 4), you must select 4 different numbers from these cells. The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column should be less than or equal to 4. The numbers in the same row are separated by ',', and the coordinate system uses the top-left cell as the coordinate (1,1), with the horizontal coordinate under the top-left cell increasing and the vertical coordinate to the right of the top-left cell increasing.\nUsing the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) as the first selected number\n3, 4, 2\n1, 3, 4\n4, 4, 3\n\nReturn your answer with the format <<<list of selected number positions>>>, where each position is given as row column (0-based indices).

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to select 4 different numbers from the 3x3 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's represent the grid as follows:\n\n```\n3, 4, 2\n1, 3, 4\n4, 4, 3\n```\n\nThe coordinates for each cell are:\n- (0,0) = 3\n- (0,1) = 4\n- (0,2) = 2\n- (1,0) = 1\n- (1,1) = 3\n- (1,2) = 4\n- (2,0) = 4\n- (2,1) = 4\n- (2,2) = 3\n\nWe need to select 3 more numbers such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. Let's find a valid selection.\nassistant > To solve this, we need to carefully select numbers such that the sum constraints are satisfied. We start with the number 2 at position (0,2). \n\nLet's analyze the grid:\n\n```\n3, 4, 2\n1, 3, 4\n4, 4, 3\n```\n\nWe need to select 3 more numbers. Let's consider the constraints:\n\n1. The sum of selected numbers in each row should be ≤ 4.\n2. The sum of selected numbers in each column should be ≤ 4.\n\nStarting with the number 2 at (0,2), we can consider the following selections:\n\n- From row 0, we cannot select any more numbers because the sum would exceed 4.\n- From row 1, we can select the number 1 at (1,0).\n- From row 2, we can select the number 3 at (2,2).\n\nNow, let's check the column constraints:\n\n- Column 0: We have selected 1 from (1,0).\n- Column 1: We have not selected any numbers.\n- Column 2: We have selected 2 from (0,2) and 3 from (2,2).\n\nThe current selections are:\n- (0,2) = 2\n- (1,0) = 1\n- (2,2) = 3\n\nThe sum in each row and column is:\n- Row 0: 2\n- Row 1: 1\n- Row 2: 3\n- Column 0: 1\n- Column 1: 0\n- Column 2: 5 (exceeds 4)\n\nSince column 2 exceeds the sum constraint, we need to adjust our selection. Let's try selecting a different number from row 2.\n\nInstead of selecting (2,2), let's select (2,0) = 4. Now, let's check the constraints again:\n\n- (0,2) = 2\n- (1,0) = 1\n- (2,0) = 4\n\nThe sum in each row and column is:\n- Row 0: 2\n- Row 1: 1\n- Row 2: 4\n- Column 0: 5 (exceeds 4)\n- Column 1: 0\n- Column 2: 2\n\nColumn 0 exceeds the sum constraint. Let's try selecting (2,1) = 4 instead of (2,0).\n\nNow, let's check the constraints again:\n\n- (0,2) = 2\n- (1,0) = 1\n- (2,1) = 4\n\nThe sum in each row and column is:\n- Row 0: 2\n- Row 1: 1\n- Row 2: 4\n- Column 0: 1\n- Column 1: 4\n- Column 2: 2\n\nColumn 1 exceeds the sum constraint. Let's try selecting (2,2) = 3 instead of (2,1).\n\nNow, let's check the constraints again:\n\n- (0,2) = 2\n- (1,0) = 1\n- (2,2) = 3\n\nThe sum in each row and column is:\n- Row 0: 2\n- Row 1: 1\n- Row 2: 3\n- Column 0: 1\n- Column 1: 0\n- Column 2: 5 (exceeds 4)\n\nIt seems we are unable to satisfy the constraints with the current approach. Let's try a different combination:\n\n- (0,2) = 2\n- (1,1) = 3\n- (2,0) = 4\n\nThe sum in each row and column is:\n- Row 0: 2\n- Row 1: 3\n- Row 2: 4\n- Column 0: 4\n- Column 1: 3\n- Column 2: 2\n\nThis selection satisfies the constraints. Therefore, the selected positions are:\n\n<<<0 2, 1 1, 2 0>>>"
