    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to select three different numbers from the given 2x2 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 1 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) is already selected.\n\nLet's analyze the grid:\n\n```\n2, 1\n3, 1\n```\n\nThe grid with coordinates is:\n\n```\n(0,0) 2, (0,1) 1\n(1,0) 3, (1,1) 1\n```\n\nWe need to select two more numbers from the grid, ensuring that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and column is less than or equal to 4.\n\n1. The number at (0,1) is already selected: 1.\n2. We need to select two more numbers from the remaining cells: (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1).\n\nLet's evaluate the possible selections:\n\n- If we select the number at (0,0) which is 2, the sum of the first row becomes 3 (2 + 1), which is valid.\n- If we select the number at (1,0) which is 3, the sum of the first column becomes 4 (1 + 3), which is valid.\n- The number at (1,1) is 1, which can be selected without exceeding the sum limit.\n\nLet's choose the numbers at positions (0,0) and (1,0) to satisfy the conditions:\n\n- Row 0: 2 (at 0,0) + 1 (at 0,1) = 3\n- Row 1: 3 (at 1,0)\n- Column 0: 2 (at 0,0) + 3 (at 1,0) = 5 (exceeds the limit)\n\nThe above selection does not satisfy the column condition. Let's try another combination:\n\n- Select the number at (0,0) which is 2.\n- Select the number at (1,1) which is 1.\n\nNow, let's check the sums:\n\n- Row 0: 2 (at 0,0) + 1 (at 0,1) = 3\n- Row 1: 1 (at 1,1)\n- Column 0: 2 (at 0,0)\n- Column 1: 1 (at 0,1) + 1 (at 1,1) = 2\n\nThis selection satisfies all the conditions. Therefore, the selected positions are:\n\n- (0,1) for the first number (already selected)\n- (0,0) for the second number\n- (1,1) for the third number\n\nThe answer is:\n\n<<<0 1, 0 0, 1 1>>>"
