    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to select 6 different numbers from the given 4x4 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 7 in the top-rightmost square (0,3) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's analyze the grid and select the numbers:\n\n```\n-1,  7, -5,  7\n 3,  3,  1,  2\n 4, -2, -3,  3\n-2, -1,  1,  6\n```\n\nWe start with the number at position (0,3), which is 7. We need to select 5 more numbers such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0.\n\n1. **Row 0**: We have selected 7 at (0,3). To ensure the product of this row is positive, we can select -1 at (0,0) and -5 at (0,2). The product of the selected numbers in this row will be \\((-1) \\times (-5) \\times 7 = 35\\), which is positive.\n\n2. **Column 3**: We have selected 7 at (0,3). To ensure the product of this column is positive, we can select 2 at (1,3) and 6 at (3,3). The product of the selected numbers in this column will be \\(7 \\times 2 \\times 6 = 84\\), which is positive.\n\n3. **Row 1**: We have selected 2 at (1,3). To ensure the product of this row is positive, we can select 3 at (1,0). The product of the selected numbers in this row will be \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\), which is positive.\n\n4. **Row 3**: We have selected 6 at (3,3). To ensure the product of this row is positive, we can select -2 at (3,0). The product of the selected numbers in this row will be \\((-2) \\times 6 = -12\\), which is negative. To make it positive, we need to select one more negative number in this row. We can select -1 at (3,1). The product of the selected numbers in this row will be \\((-2) \\times (-1) \\times 6 = 12\\), which is positive.\n\n5. **Column 0**: We have selected -1 at (0,0), 3 at (1,0), and -2 at (3,0). The product of the selected numbers in this column will be \\((-1) \\times 3 \\times (-2) = 6\\), which is positive.\n\nNow, let's list the selected positions:\n\n- (0,0): -1\n- (0,2): -5\n- (0,3): 7\n- (1,0): 3\n- (1,3): 2\n- (3,0): -2\n- (3,1): -1\n- (3,3): 6\n\nWe have selected 8 numbers, but we need only 6. Let's refine the selection to meet the criteria with exactly 6 numbers.\n\nLet's try another approach to select exactly 6 numbers:\n\n1. **Row 0**: Select -1 at (0,0) and 7 at (0,3). The product is \\((-1) \\times 7 = -7\\), which is negative. We need to select one more negative number in this row to make it positive. Select -5 at (0,2). The product is \\((-1) \\times (-5) \\times 7 = 35\\), which is positive.\n\n2. **Column 3**: We have selected 7 at (0,3). To ensure the product of this column is positive, we can select 2 at (1,3) and 6 at (3,3). The product of the selected numbers in this column will be \\(7 \\times 2 \\times 6 = 84\\), which is positive.\n\n3. **Row 1**: We have selected 2 at (1,3). To ensure the product of this row is positive, we can select 3 at (1,0). The product of the selected numbers in this row will be \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\), which is positive.\n\n4. **Row 3**: We have selected 6 at (3,3). To ensure the product of this row is positive, we can select -2 at (3,0). The product of the selected numbers in this row will be \\((-2) \\times 6 = -12\\), which is negative. To make it positive, we need to select one more negative number in this row. We can select -1 at (3,1). The product of the selected numbers in this row will be \\((-2) \\times (-1) \\times 6 = 12\\), which is positive.\n\n5. **Column 0**: We have selected -1 at (0,0), 3 at (1,0), and -2 at (3,0). The product of the selected numbers in this column will be \\((-1) \\times 3 \\times (-2) = 6\\), which is positive.\n\nNow, let's list the selected positions:\n\n- (0,0): -1\n- (0,2): -5\n- (0,3): 7\n- (1,0): 3\n- (1,3): 2\n- (3,0): -2\n\nThe selected positions are:\n\n<<<0 0, 0 2, 0 3, 1 0, 1 3, 3 0>>>"
