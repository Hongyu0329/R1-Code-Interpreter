    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to select 9 different numbers from the given 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number -8 at position (0,4) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's break down the steps to find a solution:\n\n1. **Select the first number**: We start with the number -8 at position (0,4).\n\n2. **Select additional numbers**: We need to select 8 more numbers such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is positive. This means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers.\n\n3. **Ensure distinct positions**: All selected numbers must be from different positions.\n\n4. **Check constraints**: Ensure that the product of numbers in each row and column is positive.\n\nLet's proceed to find a valid selection of numbers.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [-1, -6, 5, 5, -8],\n    [1, -5, 5, -1, -4],\n    [5, 8, 6, 5, 3],\n    [7, 5, 2, 3, 5],\n    [6, 4, 6, 7, 3]\n]\n\n# Start with the given number at position (0, 4)\nselected_positions = [(0, 4)]\n\n# Function to check if the product of numbers in a row or column is positive\ndef is_product_positive(selected_positions, grid):\n    # Create a set of selected positions for quick lookup\n    selected_set = set(selected_positions)\n    \n    # Check rows\n    for i in range(5):\n        product = 1\n        count = 0\n        for j in range(5):\n            if (i, j) in selected_set:\n                product *= grid[i][j]\n                count += 1\n        if count > 0 and product <= 0:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check columns\n    for j in range(5):\n        product = 1\n        count = 0\n        for i in range(5):\n            if (i, j) in selected_set:\n                product *= grid[i][j]\n                count += 1\n        if count > 0 and product <= 0:\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# Try to select 8 more numbers\ndef find_selection(grid, selected_positions):\n    # Try all combinations of 8 more positions\n    from itertools import combinations\n    \n    # All possible positions except the already selected one\n    all_positions = [(i, j) for i in range(5) for j in range(5) if (i, j) != (0, 4)]\n    \n    # Check combinations\n    for combo in combinations(all_positions, 8):\n        current_selection = selected_positions + list(combo)\n        if is_product_positive(current_selection, grid):\n            return current_selection\n    return None\n\n# Find a valid selection\nvalid_selection = find_selection(grid, selected_positions)\nvalid_selection\nassistant > A valid selection of 9 numbers from the grid, ensuring that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is positive, is as follows:\n\n- Selected positions: \\((0, 4), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 0)\\)\n\nIn the required format, the selected positions are:\n\n```\n<<<0 4, 0 1, 0 2, 0 3, 1 0, 1 1, 1 2, 1 4, 2 0>>>\n```"
