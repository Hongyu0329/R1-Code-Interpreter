    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to select three different numbers from the given 2x2 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 1 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) is already selected.\n\nLet's analyze the grid:\n\n```\n2, 1\n1, 3\n```\n\nThe grid with coordinates is:\n\n```\n(0,0) 2, (0,1) 1\n(1,0) 1, (1,1) 3\n```\n\nWe need to select two more numbers from the grid, ensuring that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4.\n\n1. The first selected number is at position (0,1) with value 1.\n2. We need to select two more numbers from the remaining positions: (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1).\n\nLet's evaluate the possible selections:\n\n- If we select (0,0) with value 2 and (1,0) with value 1:\n  - Row 0 sum: 2 + 1 = 3 (valid)\n  - Row 1 sum: 1 (valid)\n  - Column 0 sum: 2 + 1 = 3 (valid)\n  - Column 1 sum: 1 (valid)\n\n- If we select (0,0) with value 2 and (1,1) with value 3:\n  - Row 0 sum: 2 + 1 = 3 (valid)\n  - Row 1 sum: 3 (valid)\n  - Column 0 sum: 2 (valid)\n  - Column 1 sum: 1 + 3 = 4 (valid)\n\n- If we select (1,0) with value 1 and (1,1) with value 3:\n  - Row 0 sum: 1 (valid)\n  - Row 1 sum: 1 + 3 = 4 (valid)\n  - Column 0 sum: 1 (valid)\n  - Column 1 sum: 1 + 3 = 4 (valid)\n\nAll these combinations are valid, but we need to ensure that the numbers are different. The first combination (selecting (0,0) and (1,0)) uses the same number (1) twice, which is not allowed. The second and third combinations use different numbers.\n\nLet's choose the second combination: selecting (0,0) and (1,1).\n\nThe selected positions are:\n- (0,1) with value 1\n- (0,0) with value 2\n- (1,1) with value 3\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<<<0 1, 0 0, 1 1>>>"
