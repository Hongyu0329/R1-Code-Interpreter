  "question": "Given a 5*5 grid where each cell contains a number (between -9 to 10), you must select 10 different numbers from these cells. The product of each row and column of the selected number must be greater than 0.

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to select 10 different numbers from the grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's analyze the grid and select numbers accordingly:\n\n```\n-8, 10, -8, -3, 2\n 4, 10,  5,  2, 9\n-5, -4,  5,  9, -2\n 1,  1,  5, -4, -9\n-9, -5,  1, 10, 3\n```\n\nWe need to ensure that the product of the selected numbers in each row and column is positive. This means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers.\n\nLet's start by selecting numbers and checking the conditions.
