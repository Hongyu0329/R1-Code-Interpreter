  "question": "Given a 3*3 grid where each cell contains a number (between 1 to 4), you must select 4 different numbers from these cells. The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column should be less than or equal to 4. The numbers in the same row are separated by ',', and the coordinate system uses the top-left cell as the coordinate (1,1), with the horizontal coordinate under the top-left cell increasing and the vertical coordinate to the right of the top-left cell increasing.\nUsing the number 1 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) as the first selected number\n3, 4, 1\n4, 4, 2\n3, 3, 1\n\nReturn your answer with the format <<<list of selected number positions>>>, where each position is given as row column (0-based indices).

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to select 4 different numbers from the 3x3 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 1 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's represent the grid as follows:\n\n```\n3, 4, 1\n4, 4, 2\n3, 3, 1\n```\n\nThe coordinates for each cell in the grid are:\n\n```\n(0,0), (0,1), (0,2)\n(1,0), (1,1), (1,2)\n(2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n```\n\nWe need to select 3 more numbers such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. Let's try to find a valid selection.\nassistant > Given the constraints, we need to carefully select numbers such that the sum in each row and column remains less than or equal to 4. We already have the number 1 selected at position (0,2).\n\nLet's analyze the grid:\n\n```\n3, 4, 1\n4, 4, 2\n3, 3, 1\n```\n\n- The number 1 at position (0,2) contributes to the first row and the third column.\n- We need to select 3 more numbers, ensuring that the sum in each row and column does not exceed 4.\n\nLet's try selecting the number 1 at position (2,2) next. This will contribute to the third row and the third column.\n\nNow, let's select the number 3 at position (0,0). This will contribute to the first row and the first column.\n\nFinally, let's select the number 3 at position (2,0). This will contribute to the third row and the first column.\n\nLet's verify if this selection satisfies the conditions:\n\n- Row 0: 3 (at 0,0) + 1 (at 0,2) = 4\n- Row 2: 3 (at 2,0) + 1 (at 2,2) = 4\n- Column 0: 3 (at 0,0) + 3 (at 2,0) = 6 (exceeds 4)\n- Column 2: 1 (at 0,2) + 1 (at 2,2) = 2\n\nThe selection does not satisfy the column condition for column 0. Let's try a different selection.\n\nLet's try selecting the number 2 at position (1,2) instead of 3 at (2,0). This will contribute to the second row and the third column.\n\nNow, let's verify this selection:\n\n- Row 0: 3 (at 0,0) + 1 (at 0,2) = 4\n- Row 1: 2 (at 1,2) = 2\n- Row 2: 1 (at 2,2) = 1\n- Column 0: 3 (at 0,0) = 3\n- Column 2: 1 (at 0,2) + 2 (at 1,2) + 1 (at 2,2) = 4\n\nThis selection satisfies the conditions. Therefore, the selected positions are:\n\n- (0,2) for the first number 1\n- (1,2) for the number 2\n- (0,0) for the number 3\n- (2,2) for the second number 1\n\nThe answer in the required format is:\n\n<<<0 2, 1 2, 0 0, 2 2>>>"
