    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to select 10 different numbers from the 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number -6 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's break down the steps to find a valid selection:\n\n1. **Understand the Grid**: We have a 5x5 grid with numbers ranging from -9 to 10. We need to select 10 numbers such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is positive.\n\n2. **Initial Selection**: We start with the number -6 at position (0,4).\n\n3. **Constraints**: \n   - The product of numbers in each row and column must be positive.\n   - We need to select exactly 10 numbers.\n\n4. **Strategy**:\n   - Since the product must be positive, we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n   - We can start by selecting numbers that balance the negatives and positives in each row and column.\n\nLet's proceed with selecting the numbers and checking the conditions.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [-5, 3, 2, 10, -6],\n    [4, 7, 7, 2, 4],\n    [2, -7, -3, 7, 3],\n    [-1, 8, 9, 8, -9],\n    [-6, 2, -3, 9, 10]\n]\n\n# Initialize the selected positions with the given starting point\nselected_positions = [(0, 4)]\n\n# Function to check if the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive\ndef is_valid_selection(selected_positions, grid):\n    # Create a 5x5 matrix to mark selected positions\n    selected_matrix = [[0] * 5 for _ in range(5)]\n    for r, c in selected_positions:\n        selected_matrix[r][c] = 1\n    \n    # Check rows\n    for r in range(5):\n        product = 1\n        for c in range(5):\n            if selected_matrix[r][c] == 1:\n                product *= grid[r][c]\n        if product <= 0:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check columns\n    for c in range(5):\n        product = 1\n        for r in range(5):\n            if selected_matrix[r][c] == 1:\n                product *= grid[r][c]\n        if product <= 0:\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# Try to select 10 numbers such that the product condition is satisfied\ndef select_numbers(grid, selected_positions):\n    # We need to select 9 more numbers\n    while len(selected_positions) < 10:\n        for r in range(5):\n            for c in range(5):\n                if (r, c) not in selected_positions:\n                    selected_positions.append((r, c))\n                    if is_valid_selection(selected_positions, grid):\n                        if len(selected_positions) == 10:\n                            return selected_positions\n                    else:\n                        selected_positions.pop()\n    return selected_positions\n\n# Get the selected positions\nselected_positions = select_numbers(grid, selected_positions)\nselected_positions\nassistant > The approach I used to find the solution was inefficient and took too long to compute.
