    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to select 9 different numbers from the 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number -1 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We need to select 9 numbers, including the given number at position (0,4).\n2. The product of the numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers must be positive. This means that each row and column must have an even number of negative numbers or no negative numbers at all.\n3. We need to ensure that the selected numbers are distinct and cover 9 different positions.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the grid and selecting the numbers.
