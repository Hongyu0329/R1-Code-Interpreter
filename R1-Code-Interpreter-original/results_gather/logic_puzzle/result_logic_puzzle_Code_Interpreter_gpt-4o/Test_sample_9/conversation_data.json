    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to select three different numbers from the given 2x2 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 3 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) is already selected.\n\nThe grid is as follows:\n\n```\n1, 3\n3, 2\n```\n\nLet's denote the grid with coordinates:\n\n```\n(0,0), (0,1)\n(1,0), (1,1)\n```\n\nGiven that the number 3 at position (0,1) is already selected, we need to select two more numbers from the remaining cells: (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1).\n\nLet's evaluate the possible selections:\n\n1. **Select (0,0) and (1,0):**\n   - Numbers: 1 (at 0,0), 3 (at 0,1), 3 (at 1,0)\n   - Row 0 sum: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Column 0 sum: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Column 1 sum: 3\n   - Row 1 sum: 3\n   - This selection satisfies the condition.\n\n2. **Select (0,0) and (1,1):**\n   - Numbers: 1 (at 0,0), 3 (at 0,1), 2 (at 1,1)\n   - Row 0 sum: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Column 0 sum: 1\n   - Column 1 sum: 3 + 2 = 5 (exceeds 4)\n   - Row 1 sum: 2\n   - This selection does not satisfy the condition.\n\n3. **Select (1,0) and (1,1):**\n   - Numbers: 3 (at 0,1), 3 (at 1,0), 2 (at 1,1)\n   - Row 0 sum: 3\n   - Column 0 sum: 3\n   - Column 1 sum: 3 + 2 = 5 (exceeds 4)\n   - Row 1 sum: 3 + 2 = 5 (exceeds 4)\n   - This selection does not satisfy the condition.\n\nThe only valid selection is the first one: selecting numbers at positions (0,0), (0,1), and (1,0).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n<<<0 0, 0 1, 1 0>>>"
