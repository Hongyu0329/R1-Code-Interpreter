    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to select three different numbers from the 2x2 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 3 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) is already selected.\n\nThe grid is as follows:\n\n```\n2, 3\n3, 1\n```\n\nLet's denote the grid with coordinates:\n\n```\n(0,0) (0,1)\n(1,0) (1,1)\n```\n\nThe number 3 is already selected at position (0,1). We need to select two more numbers from the remaining cells: (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1).\n\nLet's evaluate the possible selections:\n\n1. Select (0,1) = 3 (already selected)\n2. Select (0,0) = 2\n3. Select (1,1) = 1\n\nNow, let's check the sum constraints:\n\n- Row 0: 2 (at 0,0) + 3 (at 0,1) = 5 (exceeds 4)\n- Row 1: 3 (at 1,0) + 1 (at 1,1) = 4 (valid)\n- Column 0: 2 (at 0,0) + 3 (at 1,0) = 5 (exceeds 4)\n- Column 1: 3 (at 0,1) + 1 (at 1,1) = 4 (valid)\n\nThe sum in Row 0 and Column 0 exceeds 4, so this selection is not valid.\n\nLet's try another combination:\n\n1. Select (0,1) = 3 (already selected)\n2. Select (1,0) = 3\n3. Select (1,1) = 1\n\nNow, let's check the sum constraints:\n\n- Row 0: 3 (at 0,1) = 3 (valid)\n- Row 1: 3 (at 1,0) + 1 (at 1,1) = 4 (valid)\n- Column 0: 3 (at 1,0) = 3 (valid)\n- Column 1: 3 (at 0,1) + 1 (at 1,1) = 4 (valid)\n\nThis selection satisfies all the constraints. Therefore, the selected positions are:\n\n- (0,1)\n- (1,0)\n- (1,1)\n\nIn 0-based index format, the answer is:\n\n<<<0 1, 1 0, 1 1>>>"
