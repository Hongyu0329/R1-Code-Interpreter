  "question": "Given a 4*4 grid where each cell contains a number (between -5 to 8), you must select 6 different numbers from these cells. The product of each row and column of the selected number must be greater than 0. The numbers in the same row are separated by ',', and the coordinate system uses the top-left cell as the coordinate (1,1), with the horizontal coordinate under the top-left cell increasing and the vertical coordinate to the right of the top-left cell increasing.\nUsing the number 8 in the top-rightmost square (0,3) as the first selected number\n-3, -4, 3, 8\n2, 3, 1, -2\n3, -1, -5, 5\n-2, 3, 6, -3\n\nReturn your answer with the format <<<list of selected number positions>>>, where each position is given as row column (0-based indices). For example, <<<0 3, 1 0, 2 4>>> means numbers selected are at positions (0,3), (1,0), and (2,4).",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to select 6 different numbers from the grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 8 at position (0,3) is already selected.\n\nLet's analyze the grid and select the numbers:\n\n```\nGrid:\n-3, -4,  3,  8\n 2,  3,  1, -2\n 3, -1, -5,  5\n-2,  3,  6, -3\n```\n\nWe need to ensure that the product of the selected numbers in each row and column is positive. Since we have already selected 8 at position (0,3), we need to select 5 more numbers.\n\nLet's proceed with the selection:\n\n1. Select 8 at position (0,3).\n2. Select -3 at position (0,0) to ensure the product in the first row is positive.\n3. Select 3 at position (1,1) to ensure the product in the second row is positive.\n4. Select 5 at position (2,3) to ensure the product in the third row is positive.\n5. Select 6 at position (3,2) to ensure the product in the fourth row is positive.\n6. Select 2 at position (1,0) to ensure the product in the first column is positive.\n\nNow, let's verify if the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0:\n\n- Row 0: -3, 8 (Product: -3 * 8 = -24)\n- Row 1: 2, 3 (Product: 2 * 3 = 6)\n- Row 2: 5 (Product: 5)\n- Row 3: 6 (Product: 6)\n\n- Column 0: -3, 2 (Product: -3 * 2 = -6)\n- Column 1: 3 (Product: 3)\n- Column 2: 6 (Product: 6)\n- Column 3: 8, 5 (Product: 8 * 5 = 40)\n\nIt seems there is an issue with the product of the first row and first column being negative. Let's adjust the selection to ensure all products are positive.\n\nLet's try a different selection:\n\n1. Select 8 at position (0,3).\n2. Select 3 at position (0,2) to ensure the product in the first row is positive.\n3. Select 3 at position (1,1) to ensure the product in the second row is positive.\n4. Select 5 at position (2,3) to ensure the product in the third row is positive.\n5. Select 6 at position (3,2) to ensure the product in the fourth row is positive.\n6. Select 2 at position (1,0) to ensure the product in the first column is positive.\n\nNow, let's verify the products again:\n\n- Row 0: 3, 8 (Product: 3 * 8 = 24)\n- Row 1: 2, 3 (Product: 2 * 3 = 6)\n- Row 2: 5 (Product: 5)\n- Row 3: 6 (Product: 6)\n\n- Column 0: 2 (Product: 2)\n- Column 1: 3 (Product: 3)\n- Column 2: 3, 6 (Product: 3 * 6 = 18)\n- Column 3: 8, 5 (Product: 8 * 5 = 40)\n\nAll products are positive. Therefore, the selected positions are:\n\n<<<0 3, 0 2, 1 1, 2 3, 3 2, 1 0>>>"
