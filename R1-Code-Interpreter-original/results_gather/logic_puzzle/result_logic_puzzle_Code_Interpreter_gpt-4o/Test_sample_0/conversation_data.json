    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to select three different numbers from the given 2x2 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) is the first selected number.\n\nThe grid is as follows:\n\n```\n1, 2\n3, 1\n```\n\nLet's denote the grid with coordinates:\n\n```\n(0,0) (0,1)\n(1,0) (1,1)\n```\n\nWe need to select two more numbers from the grid, ensuring that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and column is less than or equal to 4.\n\nLet's analyze the possibilities:\n\n1. We have already selected the number 2 at position (0,1).\n2.

For example, the first valid selection is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{<<<0 1, 0 0, 1 0>>>}\n\\]\n\nThis means the selected numbers are at positions (0,1), (0,0), and (1,0)."
