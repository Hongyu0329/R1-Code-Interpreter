  "question": "Given a 3*3 grid where each cell contains a number (between 1 to 4), you must select 4 different numbers from these cells. The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column should be less than or equal to 4. The numbers in the same row are separated by ',', and the coordinate system uses the top-left cell as the coordinate (1,1), with the horizontal coordinate under the top-left cell increasing and the vertical coordinate to the right of the top-left cell increasing.\nUsing the number 1 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) as the first selected number\n2, 1, 1\n4, 2, 3\n3, 3, 3\n\nReturn your answer with the format <<<list of selected number positions>>>, where each position is given as row column (0-based indices). For example, <<<0 3, 1 0, 2 4>>> means numbers selected are at positions (0,3), (1,0), and (2,4).",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to select 4 different numbers from the 3x3 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 1 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's analyze the grid:\n\n```\n2, 1, 1\n4, 2, 3\n3, 3, 3\n```\n\nThe coordinates for each cell are as follows:\n\n```\n(0,0), (0,1), (0,2)\n(1,0), (1,1), (1,2)\n(2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n```\n\nWe need to select 4 different numbers, starting with the number at (0,2), which is 1. We will then select additional numbers while ensuring that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and column is less than or equal to 4.\n\nLet's proceed with the selection.\nassistant > Given the constraints, we start with the number at position (0,2), which is 1. We need to select three more numbers such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and column is less than or equal to 4.\n\nLet's consider the grid again:\n\n```\n2, 1, 1\n4, 2, 3\n3, 3, 3\n```\n\n- We have already selected the number at (0,2), which is 1.\n- We need to select numbers such that the sum in each row and column is â‰¤ 4.\n\nLet's try to select the numbers:\n\n1. **Select (0,2):** 1 (already selected)\n2. **Select (0,0):** 2 (Row 0 sum: 2 + 1 = 3, Column 0 sum: 2)\n3. **Select (1,1):** 2 (Row 1 sum: 2, Column 1 sum: 1 + 2 = 3)\n4. **Select (2,0):** 3 (Row 2 sum: 3, Column 0 sum: 2 + 3 = 5)\n\nHowever, selecting (2,0) makes the column sum exceed 4. Let's try a different selection:\n\n1. **Select (0,2):** 1 (already selected)\n2. **Select (0,0):** 2 (Row 0 sum: 2 + 1 = 3, Column 0 sum: 2)\n3. **Select (1,1):** 2 (Row 1 sum: 2, Column 1 sum: 1 + 2 = 3)\n4. **Select (2,1):** 3 (Row 2 sum: 3, Column 1 sum: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6)\n\nThis also doesn't work. Let's try another approach:\n\n1. **Select (0,2):** 1 (already selected)\n2. **Select (0,0):** 2 (Row 0 sum: 2 + 1 = 3, Column 0 sum: 2)\n3. **Select (1,1):** 2 (Row 1 sum: 2, Column 1 sum: 1 + 2 = 3)\n4. **Select (2,2):** 3 (Row 2 sum: 3, Column 2 sum: 1 + 3 = 4)\n\nThis selection satisfies the condition. Let's finalize the selected positions:\n\n- (0,2)\n- (0,0)\n- (1,1)\n- (2,2)\n\nThe selected positions are: <<<0 2, 0 0, 1 1, 2 2>>>."
