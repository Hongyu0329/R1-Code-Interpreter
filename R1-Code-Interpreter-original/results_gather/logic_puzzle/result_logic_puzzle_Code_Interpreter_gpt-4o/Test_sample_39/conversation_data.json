  "question": "Given a 4*4 grid where each cell contains a number (between -5 to 8), you must select 6 different numbers from these cells. The product of each row and column of the selected number must be greater than 0. The numbers in the same row are separated by ',', and the coordinate system uses the top-left cell as the coordinate (1,1), with the horizontal coordinate under the top-left cell increasing and the vertical coordinate to the right of the top-left cell increasing.\nUsing the number -1 in the top-rightmost square (0,3) as the first selected number\n8, 6, 2, -1\n1, 8, -3, 5\n4, -4, 1, 4\n8, 7, -5, 3\n\nReturn your answer with the format <<<list of selected number positions>>>, where each position is given as row column (0-based indices). For example, <<<0 3, 1 0, 2 4>>> means numbers selected are at positions (0,3), (1,0), and (2,4).",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to select 6 different numbers from the given 4x4 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number at position (0,3) is -1, and it is the first selected number.\n\nLet's analyze the grid and select the numbers:\n\n```\n8,  6,  2, -1\n1,  8, -3,  5\n4, -4,  1,  4\n8,  7, -5,  3\n```\n\nWe need to ensure that the product of the selected numbers in each row and column is positive. Since we have already selected -1 at position (0,3), we need to select an odd number of negative numbers in each row and column that contains -1 to ensure a positive product.\n\nLet's proceed with the selection:\n\n1. Select -1 at position (0,3).\n2. Select 8 at position (0,0) to ensure a positive product in the first row.\n3. Select 5 at position (1,3) to ensure a positive product in the fourth column.\n4. Select 1 at position (1,0) to ensure a positive product in the second row.\n5. Select 4 at position (2,0) to ensure a positive product in the third row.\n6. Select 3 at position (3,3) to ensure a positive product in the fourth row.\n\nNow, let's verify the selection:\n\n- Row 0: 8, -1 (Product: -8, not positive)\n- Row 1: 1, 5 (Product: 5, positive)\n- Row 2: 4 (Product: 4, positive)\n- Row 3: 3 (Product: 3, positive)\n\n- Column 0: 8, 1, 4 (Product: 32, positive)\n- Column 3: -1, 5, 3 (Product: -15, not positive)\n\nIt seems we need to adjust the selection to ensure all products are positive. Let's try a different approach:\n\n1. Select -1 at position (0,3).\n2. Select 8 at position (0,0).\n3. Select 8 at position (1,1).\n4. Select 4 at position (2,3).\n5. Select 7 at position (3,1).\n6.

    "Given a 4*4 grid where each cell contains a number (between -5 to 8), you must select 6 different numbers from these cells. The product of each row and column of the selected number must be greater than 0. The numbers in the same row are separated by ',', and the coordinate system uses the top-left cell as the coordinate (1,1), with the horizontal coordinate under the top-left cell increasing and the vertical coordinate to the right of the top-left cell increasing.\nUsing the number -1 in the top-rightmost square (0,3) as the first selected number\n8, 6, 2, -1\n1, 8, -3, 5\n4, -4, 1, 4\n8, 7, -5, 3\n\nReturn your answer with the format <<<list of selected number positions>>>, where each position is given as row column (0-based indices).
