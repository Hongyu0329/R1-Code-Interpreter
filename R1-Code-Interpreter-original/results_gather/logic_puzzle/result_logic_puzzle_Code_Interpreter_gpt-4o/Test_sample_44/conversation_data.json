    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to select 6 different numbers from the 4x4 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,3) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's analyze the grid and select the numbers:\n\n```\n7, -2,  4,  2\n2,  4,  3,  8\n1,  5, -3, -3\n2,  7, -4,  6\n```\n\nWe need to ensure that the product of the selected numbers in each row and column is positive.
