    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to select 6 different numbers from the given 4x4 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number at position (0,3) is already selected.\n\nLet's analyze the grid and select the numbers:\n\n```\n8,  4,  5,  1\n1, -4, -1,  4\n-5, -3,  7,  6\n4,  1,  7,  5\n```\n\nThe selected number at position (0,3) is 1. We need to select 5 more numbers such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0.\n\n1. **Row 0**: We have selected 1 at (0,3). We need to select another number from this row. Let's select 8 at (0,0).\n\n2. **Row 1**: We need to select a number such that the product is positive. Let's select 4 at (1,3).\n\n3. **Row 2**: We need to select a number such that the product is positive. Let's select 7 at (2,2).\n\n4. **Row 3**: We need to select a number such that the product is positive. Let's select 7 at (3,2).\n\nNow, let's check the columns:\n\n- **Column 0**: We have selected 8 at (0,0). We need to select another number from this column. Let's select 4 at (3,0).\n\n- **Column 1**: We need to select a number such that the product is positive. Let's select 1 at (3,1).\n\nNow, let's verify if the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0:\n\n- **Row 0**: 8, 1 (Product = 8)\n- **Row 1**: 4 (Product = 4)\n- **Row 2**: 7 (Product = 7)\n- **Row 3**: 4, 1, 7 (Product = 28)\n\n- **Column 0**: 8, 4 (Product = 32)\n- **Column 1**: 1 (Product = 1)\n- **Column 2**: 7, 7 (Product = 49)\n- **Column 3**: 1, 4 (Product = 4)\n\nAll products are greater than 0. Therefore, the selected positions are:\n\n- (0,0), (0,3), (1,3), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2)\n\nLet's format the answer as requested:\n\n<<<0 0, 0 3, 1 3, 2 2, 3 0, 3 2>>>"
