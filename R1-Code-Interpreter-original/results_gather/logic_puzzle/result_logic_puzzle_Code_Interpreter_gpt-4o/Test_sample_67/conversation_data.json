    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to select 10 different numbers from the given 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Select the first number**: We start with the number 2 at position (0,4).\n\n2. **Ensure positive product for rows and columns**: We need to select numbers such that the product of the selected numbers in each row and column is positive. This means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n\n3. **Select additional numbers**: We will select additional numbers while ensuring the above condition is met.\n\nLet's proceed with selecting the numbers.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [4, 7, -7, 6, 2],\n    [-6, -3, 3, 10, 2],\n    [9, 4, 10, 5, 4],\n    [-4, 4, 8, 5, 7],\n    [8, 1, 10, -2, 10]\n]\n\n# Start with the given number at position (0, 4)\nselected_positions = [(0, 4)]\n\n# Function to check if the product of selected numbers in a row or column is positive\ndef is_product_positive(selected_positions, grid):\n    # Initialize row and column products\n    row_products = [1] * 5\n    col_products = [1] * 5\n    \n    # Calculate the product for each row and column\n    for r, c in selected_positions:\n        row_products[r] *= grid[r][c]\n        col_products[c] *= grid[r][c]\n    \n    # Check if all products are positive\n    return all(p > 0 for p in row_products) and all(p > 0 for p in col_products)\n\n# Try to select 9 more numbers\nfor r in range(5):\n    for c in range(5):\n        if (r, c) not in selected_positions:\n            selected_positions.append((r, c))\n            if len(selected_positions) == 10 and is_product_positive(selected_positions, grid):\n                break\n            elif len(selected_positions) > 10 or not is_product_positive(selected_positions, grid):\n                selected_positions.pop()\n    if len(selected_positions) == 10:\n        break\n\nselected_positions\nassistant > The selected positions that satisfy the condition of having a positive product for each row and column are:\n\n- (0, 4)\n- (0, 0)\n- (0, 1)\n- (0, 3)\n- (1, 2)\n- (1, 3)\n- (1, 4)\n- (2, 0)\n- (2, 1)\n- (2, 2)\n\nIn the required format, the answer is:\n\n```\n<<<0 4, 0 0, 0 1, 0 3, 1 2, 1 3, 1 4, 2 0, 2 1, 2 2>>>\n```"
