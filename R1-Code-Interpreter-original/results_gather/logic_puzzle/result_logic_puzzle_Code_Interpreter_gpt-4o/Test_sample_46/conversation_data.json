    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to select 6 different numbers from the given 4x4 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number at position (0,3) is already selected.\n\nLet's analyze the grid and select the numbers:\n\n```\nGrid:\n-1,  4, -3,  1\n-1,  3,  3, -4\n 6,  8, -2,  7\n-2,  5,  7, -3\n```\n\nWe need to ensure that the product of the selected numbers in each row and column is positive. This means that each row and column with selected numbers must have an even number of negative numbers (including zero negatives).\n\nLet's start by selecting the number at (0,3) and then choose additional numbers to satisfy the conditions. \n\n1. Start with (0,3) = 1 (already selected).\n2. Select (0,1) = 4 (positive).\n3. Select (1,2) = 3 (positive).\n4. Select (2,0) = 6 (positive).\n5. Select (3,1) = 5 (positive).\n6. Select (3,2) = 7 (positive).\n\nNow, let's verify the product conditions for each row and column:\n\n- Row 0: 4, 1 → Product = 4 (positive)\n- Row 1: 3 → Product = 3 (positive)\n- Row 2: 6 → Product = 6 (positive)\n- Row 3: 5, 7 → Product = 35 (positive)\n\n- Column 0: 6 → Product = 6 (positive)\n- Column 1: 4, 5 → Product = 20 (positive)\n- Column 2: 3, 7 → Product = 21 (positive)\n- Column 3: 1 → Product = 1 (positive)\n\nAll products are positive, so the selection is valid.\n\nThe selected positions are:\n- (0,3)\n- (0,1)\n- (1,2)\n- (2,0)\n- (3,1)\n- (3,2)\n\nLet's format the answer as requested:\n\n<<<0 3, 0 1, 1 2, 2 0, 3 1, 3 2>>>"
