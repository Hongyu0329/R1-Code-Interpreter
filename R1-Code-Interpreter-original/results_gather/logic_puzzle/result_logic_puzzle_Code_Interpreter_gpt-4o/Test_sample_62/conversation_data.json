    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to select 9 different numbers from the given 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number -2 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's analyze the grid and select numbers that satisfy the condition:\n\n```\n2, -2, -5, -7, -2\n7, 2, -7, 8, -1\n4, -5, -6, 5, 6\n7, -6, 2, 8, 4\n-1, 8, 4, -4, 5\n```\n\nWe need to ensure that the product of the selected numbers in each row and column is positive.
