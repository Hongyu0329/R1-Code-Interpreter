    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to select 6 different numbers from the given 4x4 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number at position (0,3) is already selected.\n\nLet's analyze the grid and select the numbers:\n\n```\n-1, 8, 4, 1\n3, 4, 6, 1\n-4, 1, -1, 4\n-1, 2, 4, -2\n```\n\nThe selected number at position (0,3) is 1. We need to select 5 more numbers such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is positive.\n\n1. **Row 0**: We have selected 1 at (0,3). We need to select another number in this row. We can select 8 at (0,1) because 1 * 8 = 8, which is positive.\n\n2. **Row 1**: We can select 3 at (1,0) and 4 at (1,1). The product 3 * 4 = 12, which is positive.\n\n3. **Row 2**: We can select 1 at (2,1) and 4 at (2,3). The product 1 * 4 = 4, which is positive.\n\n4. **Row 3**: We can select 2 at (3,1) and 4 at (3,2). The product 2 * 4 = 8, which is positive.\n\nNow, let's check the columns:\n\n- **Column 0**: We have selected 3 at (1,0). The product is positive.\n- **Column 1**: We have selected 8 at (0,1), 4 at (1,1), 1 at (2,1), and 2 at (3,1). The product 8 * 4 * 1 * 2 = 64, which is positive.\n- **Column 2**: We have selected 4 at (3,2). The product is positive.\n- **Column 3**: We have selected 1 at (0,3) and 4 at (2,3). The product 1 * 4 = 4, which is positive.\n\nThe selected positions are:\n- (0,3) for 1\n- (0,1) for 8\n- (1,0) for 3\n- (1,1) for 4\n- (2,1) for 1\n- (2,3) for 4\n\nLet's format the answer as requested:\n\n<<<0 3, 0 1, 1 0, 1 1, 2 1, 2 3>>>"
