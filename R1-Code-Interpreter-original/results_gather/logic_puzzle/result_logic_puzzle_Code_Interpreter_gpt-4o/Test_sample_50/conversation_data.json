    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to select 9 different numbers from the 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 7 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the grid and selecting numbers that satisfy the conditions:\n\n```\n3,  1, -1, -6,  7\n7, -4, -3,  1,  6\n1,  3, -2,  5,  3\n6,  8, -7, -8,  5\n1,  4,  5,  1, -7\n```\n\nWe need to ensure that the product of the selected numbers in each row and column is positive. This means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers.\n\nLet's start by selecting numbers and checking the conditions:\n\n1. Start with (0,4) = 7 (given).\n2. Select (0,0) = 3 and (0,1) = 1 to ensure the product of the first row is positive.\n3. Select (1,0) = 7 and (1,3) = 1 to ensure the product of the second row is positive.\n4. Select (2,1) = 3 and (2,3) = 5 to ensure the product of the third row is positive.\n5. Select (3,0) = 6 and (3,1) = 8 to ensure the product of the fourth row is positive.\n6. Select (4,2) = 5 to ensure the product of the fifth row is positive.\n\nNow, let's verify the selection:\n\n- Row 0: (0,0), (0,1), (0,4) = 3, 1, 7 → Product = 21 (positive)\n- Row 1: (1,0), (1,3) = 7, 1 → Product = 7 (positive)\n- Row 2: (2,1), (2,3) = 3, 5 → Product = 15 (positive)\n- Row 3: (3,0), (3,1) = 6, 8 → Product = 48 (positive)\n- Row 4: (4,2) = 5 → Product = 5 (positive)\n\n- Column 0: (0,0), (1,0), (3,0) = 3, 7, 6 → Product = 126 (positive)\n- Column 1: (0,1), (2,1), (3,1) = 1, 3, 8 → Product = 24 (positive)\n- Column 2: (4,2) = 5 → Product = 5 (positive)\n- Column 3: (1,3), (2,3) = 1, 5 → Product = 5 (positive)\n- Column 4: (0,4) = 7 → Product = 7 (positive)\n\nAll products are positive, so the selection is valid.\n\nThe selected positions are:\n- (0,0), (0,1), (0,4)\n- (1,0), (1,3)\n- (2,1), (2,3)\n- (3,0), (3,1)\n- (4,2)\n\nLet's format the answer as requested:\n\n<<<0 0, 0 1, 0 4, 1 0, 1 3, 2 1, 2 3, 3 0, 3 1>>>"
