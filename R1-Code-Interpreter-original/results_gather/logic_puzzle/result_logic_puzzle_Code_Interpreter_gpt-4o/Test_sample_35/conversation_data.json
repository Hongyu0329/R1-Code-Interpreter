    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to select 6 different numbers from the grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 8 in the top-rightmost square (0,3) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's analyze the grid and select the numbers:\n\n```\n1, 3, -3, 8\n8, 7, 8, -3\n2, 2, -4, -1\n8, 2, 2, 4\n```\n\nWe need to ensure that the product of the selected numbers in each row and column is positive. This means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers.\n\nLet's start by selecting the number at (0,3) and then choose the remaining numbers to satisfy the conditions.
