    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to select three different numbers from the 2x2 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's represent the grid as follows:\n\n```\n(0,0) (0,1)\n(1,0) (1,1)\n```\n\nGiven grid:\n```\n1, 2\n3, 1\n```\n\nWe need to select two more numbers from the grid, ensuring that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4.\n\nLet's analyze the possible selections:\n\n1.
