  "question": "Given a 6*6 grid where each cell contains a number (between -10 to 12), you must select 12 different numbers from these cells. The product of each row and column of the selected number must be greater than 0. The numbers in the same row are separated by ',', and the coordinate system uses the top-left cell as the coordinate (1,1), with the horizontal coordinate under the top-left cell increasing and the vertical coordinate to the right of the top-left cell increasing.\nUsing the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,5) as the first selected number\n-4, 2, 3, -10, 11, 2\n5, 4, -6, -10, 4, 4\n6, -9, 4, 12, 6, 8\n12, -10, 6, 6, -5, 1\n11, -4, 1, 11, 11, 7\n-5, -3, 10, 11, -6, 12\n\nReturn your answer with the format <<<list of selected number positions>>>, where each position is given as row column (0-based indices).

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to select 12 different numbers from the 6x6 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,5) is the first selected number.\n\nTo ensure the product of each row and column is greater than 0, we need to have an even number of negative numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers.
