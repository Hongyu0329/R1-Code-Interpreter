    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to select 6 different numbers from the given 4x4 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number at position (0,3) is -1 and must be included in our selection.\n\nLet's analyze the grid and select numbers that satisfy the conditions:\n\n```\nGrid:\n-4,  5,  7, -1\n 2, -4, -2, -5\n 6,  6, -4,  4\n-1,  2,  1, -1\n```\n\nWe need to ensure that the product of the selected numbers in each row and column is positive. This means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers.\n\nLet's start by selecting numbers and checking the conditions:\n\n1.
