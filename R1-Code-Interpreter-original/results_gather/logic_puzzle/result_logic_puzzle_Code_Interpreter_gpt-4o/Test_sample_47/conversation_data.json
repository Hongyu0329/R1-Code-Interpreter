  "question": "Given a 4*4 grid where each cell contains a number (between -5 to 8), you must select 6 different numbers from these cells. The product of each row and column of the selected number must be greater than 0. The numbers in the same row are separated by ',', and the coordinate system uses the top-left cell as the coordinate (1,1), with the horizontal coordinate under the top-left cell increasing and the vertical coordinate to the right of the top-left cell increasing.\nUsing the number 7 in the top-rightmost square (0,3) as the first selected number\n-3, 8, 8, 7\n2, -3, 5, 3\n5, 4, 6, 5\n6, -5, 5, 1\n\nReturn your answer with the format <<<list of selected number positions>>>, where each position is given as row column (0-based indices). For example, <<<0 3, 1 0, 2 4>>> means numbers selected are at positions (0,3), (1,0), and (2,4).",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to select 6 different numbers from the 4x4 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 7 at position (0,3) is already selected.\n\nLet's analyze the grid and select the numbers:\n\n```\nGrid:\n-3, 8, 8, 7\n2, -3, 5, 3\n5, 4, 6, 5\n6, -5, 5, 1\n```\n\nWe need to ensure that the product of the selected numbers in each row and column is positive. This means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers.\n\nLet's start by selecting the number 7 at position (0,3) and then choose the remaining numbers:\n\n1. Select 7 at (0,3).\n2. Select 8 at (0,1) and 8 at (0,2) to ensure the product of the first row is positive.\n3. Select 5 at (2,0) and 6 at (2,2) to ensure the product of the third row is positive.\n4. Select 5 at (3,2) to ensure the product of the third column is positive.\n\nNow, let's verify the selections:\n\n- Row 0: 8, 8, 7 (Product: 8 * 8 * 7 = 448 > 0)\n- Row 2: 5, 6 (Product: 5 * 6 = 30 > 0)\n- Column 2: 8, 6, 5 (Product: 8 * 6 * 5 = 240 > 0)\n- Column 3: 7 (Product: 7 > 0)\n\nThe selected positions are: (0,3), (0,1), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,2).\n\nLet's format the answer as requested:\n\n<<<0 3, 0 1, 0 2, 2 0, 2 2, 3 2>>>"
