    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to select 16 different numbers from the 7x7 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number -7 in the top-rightmost square (0,6) is the first selected number.\n\nThe key points to consider are:\n1. The product of numbers in each row and column must be positive, which means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n2. We need to select exactly 16 numbers, which means some rows and columns will have more than one selected number.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the grid and selecting numbers that satisfy the conditions. We'll ensure that the product of numbers in each row and column is positive by carefully choosing an even number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n\nHere's the grid for reference:\n\n```\n-13,  6, 12, 14, 12, -3, -7\n 13, -13,  1, 13, 13,  2, -10\n  2,  6, -9, 13,  1, 10, 12\n  8, -6, 13,  8, 14,  9, 13\n  3, 10,-14, 10, -6,  5, 11\n -9, 11,  4,  5,  7,-11,-10\n -5,  1,  4, 13, 14,  2, 12\n```\n\nLet's proceed with selecting the numbers.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [-13,  6, 12, 14, 12, -3, -7],\n    [ 13, -13,  1, 13, 13,  2, -10],\n    [  2,  6, -9, 13,  1, 10, 12],\n    [  8, -6, 13,  8, 14,  9, 13],\n    [  3, 10,-14, 10, -6,  5, 11],\n    [ -9, 11,  4,  5,  7,-11,-10],\n    [ -5,  1,  4, 13, 14,  2, 12]\n]\n\n# Start with the given number at position (0, 6)\nselected_positions = [(0, 6)]\n\n# Function to check if the product of selected numbers in a row or column is positive\ndef is_product_positive(selected_positions, grid):\n    # Check rows\n    for row in range(7):\n        product = 1\n        for col in range(7):\n            if (row, col) in selected_positions:\n                product *= grid[row][col]\n        if product <= 0:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check columns\n    for col in range(7):\n        product = 1\n        for row in range(7):\n            if (row, col) in selected_positions:\n                product *= grid[row][col]\n        if product <= 0:\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# Function to select numbers ensuring the product condition\ndef select_numbers(grid, selected_positions):\n    # Try to select numbers ensuring the product condition\n    for row in range(7):\n        for col in range(7):\n            if (row, col) not in selected_positions:\n                selected_positions.append((row, col))\n                if len(selected_positions) == 16 and is_product_positive(selected_positions, grid):\n                    return selected_positions\n                elif len(selected_positions) < 16:\n                    result = select_numbers(grid, selected_positions)\n                    if result:\n                        return result\n                selected_positions.pop()\n    return None\n\n# Select numbers\nselected_positions = select_numbers(grid, selected_positions)\nselected_positions\nassistant > The recursive approach I attempted took too long to find a solution due to the large number of possible combinations.
