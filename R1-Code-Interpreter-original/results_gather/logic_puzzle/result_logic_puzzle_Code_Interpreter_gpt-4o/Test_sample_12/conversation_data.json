    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to select three different numbers from the 2x2 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 3 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's analyze the grid:\n\n```\nRow 0: 1, 3\nRow 1: 1, 2\n```\n\nThe grid with coordinates is:\n\n```\n(0,0): 1, (0,1): 3\n(1,0): 1, (1,1): 2\n```\n\nWe need to select two more numbers from the grid, ensuring that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and column is less than or equal to 4.\n\nLet's consider the constraints:\n\n1. We have already selected the number 3 at position (0,1).\n2. We need to select two more numbers from the remaining cells: (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1).\n3.
