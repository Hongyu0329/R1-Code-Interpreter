The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column should be less than or equal to 4.

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to select three different numbers from the given 2x2 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 1 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) is already selected.\n\nLet's analyze the grid:\n\n```\n(0,0) (0,1)\n  3     1\n(1,0) (1,1)\n  3     2\n```\n\nWe need to select two more numbers from the grid, ensuring that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and column is less than or equal to 4.\n\n1. The number at (0,1) is 1, which is already selected.\n2. We need to select two more numbers from the remaining cells: (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1).\n\nLet's evaluate the possible selections:\n\n- If we select the number at (0,0) which is 3, the sum of the first row becomes 3 + 1 = 4, which is valid.\n- If we select the number at (1,1) which is 2, the sum of the second row becomes 3 + 2 = 5, which is invalid.\n- If we select the number at (1,0) which is 3, the sum of the second row becomes 3 + 3 = 6, which is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the only valid selection is to choose the number at (0,0) which is 3, and the number at (1,1) which is 2.\n\nLet's verify this selection:\n\n- Row 0: 3 (at 0,0) + 1 (at 0,1) = 4\n- Row 1: 2 (at 1,1) = 2\n- Column 0: 3 (at 0,0) = 3\n- Column 1: 1 (at 0,1) + 2 (at 1,1) = 3\n\nAll sums are less than or equal to 4.\n\nThus, the selected positions are (0,1), (0,0), and (1,1).\n\nThe answer in the required format is:\n\n<<<0 1, 0 0, 1 1>>>"
