  "question": "Given a 5*5 grid where each cell contains a number (between -10 to 9), you must select 10 different numbers from these cells. The product of each row and column of the selected number must be greater than 0.

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to select 10 different numbers from the 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 8 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's analyze the grid and select numbers that satisfy the condition:\n\n```\n6,  -8, -3,  9,  8\n4,   8,  9,  3, -8\n9,   4,  5,  2,  1\n-4, -2, -4,  2,  7\n1,  -3,  9,  1, -10\n```\n\nWe need to ensure that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive.
