    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to select 12 different numbers from the 6x6 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 10 in the top-rightmost square (0,5) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's break down the steps to solve this:\n\n1. **Understand the Grid**: We have a 6x6 grid with numbers ranging from -12 to 12. We need to select 12 numbers such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is positive.\n\n2. **Constraints**: \n   - The product of numbers in each row and column must be positive. This means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n   - We must select exactly 12 numbers.\n\n3. **Initial Selection**: We start with the number 10 at position (0,5).\n\n4. **Strategy**:\n   - We need to ensure that each row and column with selected numbers has an even number of negative numbers to ensure a positive product.\n   - We will try to balance the selection of positive and negative numbers across the grid.\n\n5. **Implementation**: We will iterate through the grid and select numbers while keeping track of the constraints.\n\nLet's implement this strategy.\nassistant > code_interpreter\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [12, 2, 8, 9, 4, 10],\n    [-9, -12, 10, 2, -8, 7],\n    [-4, 9, 4, -8, -10, -11],\n    [-4, 12, -1, 11, -5, -2],\n    [-1, 8, 11, 3, -6, 2],\n    [11, -6, -12, -11, 4, 4]\n]\n\n# Initialize the selected positions with the given starting point\nselected_positions = [(0, 5)]\n\n# Function to check if the current selection is valid\ndef is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n    # Check row and column products\n    row_products = [1] * 6\n    col_products = [1] * 6\n    for r, c in selected_positions:\n        row_products[r] *= grid[r][c]\n        col_products[c] *= grid[r][c]\n    \n    # Check if all products are positive\n    return all(p > 0 for p in row_products) and all(p > 0 for p in col_products)\n\n# Try to select 12 numbers\ndef select_numbers(grid, selected_positions):\n    # Iterate over the grid to select numbers\n    for r in range(6):\n        for c in range(6):\n            if (r, c) not in selected_positions:\n                selected_positions.append((r, c))\n                if len(selected_positions) == 12:\n                    if is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n                        return selected_positions\n                    else:\n                        selected_positions.pop()\n                elif len(selected_positions) < 12:\n                    result = select_numbers(grid, selected_positions)\n                    if result:\n                        return result\n                    selected_positions.pop()\n    return None\n\n# Get the selected positions\nselected_positions = select_numbers(grid, selected_positions)\n\n# Format the output\nselected_positions_str = ', '.join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in selected_positions)\nselected_positions_str\nassistant > The selected positions in the grid that satisfy the conditions are:\n\n<<<0 5, 0 0, 0 1, 0 2, 0 3, 0 4, 1 0, 1 1, 2 0, 2 3, 5 1, 5 3>>>\n\nThese positions ensure that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0."
