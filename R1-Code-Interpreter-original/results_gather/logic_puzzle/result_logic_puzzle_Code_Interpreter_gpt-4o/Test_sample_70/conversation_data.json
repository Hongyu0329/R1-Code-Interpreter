    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to select 10 different numbers from the grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 9 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's analyze the grid and select numbers accordingly:\n\n```\n-2, -3, -8,  8,  9\n-5,  7, -3,  3,  2\n-6, -2,  4,  6, -8\n 8, -10, 10,  8, -6\n 5, -9,  8, -10, -4\n```\n\n1. Start with the number 9 at position (0,4).\n2. We need to ensure that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive. This means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n\nLet's select the numbers step by step:\n\n- Row 0: We have selected 9 at (0,4). We can select 8 at (0,3) to ensure a positive product for row 0.\n- Row 1: Select 7 at (1,1) and 3 at (1,3) to ensure a positive product for row 1.\n- Row 2: Select 4 at (2,2) and 6 at (2,3) to ensure a positive product for row 2.\n- Row 3: Select 10 at (3,2) and 8 at (3,3) to ensure a positive product for row 3.\n- Row 4: Select 8 at (4,2) and 5 at (4,0) to ensure a positive product for row 4.\n\nNow, let's verify the column products:\n\n- Column 0: 5 at (4,0) ensures a positive product.\n- Column 1: 7 at (1,1) ensures a positive product.\n- Column 2: 4 at (2,2), 10 at (3,2), and 8 at (4,2) ensure a positive product.\n- Column 3: 8 at (0,3), 3 at (1,3), 6 at (2,3), and 8 at (3,3) ensure a positive product.\n- Column 4: 9 at (0,4) ensures a positive product.\n\nThe selected positions are:\n- (0,4), (0,3)\n- (1,1), (1,3)\n- (2,2), (2,3)\n- (3,2), (3,3)\n- (4,2), (4,0)\n\nLet's format the answer as requested:\n\n<<<0 4, 0 3, 1 1, 1 3, 2 2, 2 3, 3 2, 3 3, 4 2, 4 0>>>"
