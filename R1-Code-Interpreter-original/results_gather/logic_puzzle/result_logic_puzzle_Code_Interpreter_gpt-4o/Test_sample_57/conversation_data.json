  "question": "Given a 5*5 grid where each cell contains a number (between -8 to 8), you must select 9 different numbers from these cells. The product of each row and column of the selected number must be greater than 0. The numbers in the same row are separated by ',', and the coordinate system uses the top-left cell as the coordinate (1,1), with the horizontal coordinate under the top-left cell increasing and the vertical coordinate to the right of the top-left cell increasing.\nUsing the number 5 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) as the first selected number\n8, 3, -8, -6, 5\n-2, -7, 7, -3, 3\n3, 2, 2, 8, -3\n4, 5, -5, -2, -5\n4, -4, -7, 5, 8\n\nReturn your answer with the format <<<list of selected number positions>>>, where each position is given as row column (0-based indices). For example, <<<0 3, 1 0, 2 4>>> means numbers selected are at positions (0,3), (1,0), and (2,4).",

    "\nassistant > To solve this problem, we need to select 9 different numbers from the given 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number at position (0,4) is already selected, which is 5.\n\nLet's analyze the grid and select the numbers step by step:\n\n```\n8,  3, -8, -6,  5\n-2, -7,  7, -3,  3\n 3,  2,  2,  8, -3\n 4,  5, -5, -2, -5\n 4, -4, -7,  5,  8\n```\n\n1. Start with the number at (0,4), which is 5.\n2. We need to ensure that the product of the selected numbers in each row and column is positive. This means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column or all positive numbers.\n\nLet's try to select the numbers:\n\n- From row 0, we already have 5 at (0,4). We can select 8 at (0,0) and 3 at (0,1) to ensure a positive product.\n- From row 1, we can select 7 at (1,2) and 3 at (1,4) to ensure a positive product.\n- From row 2, we can select 3 at (2,0) and 2 at (2,1) to ensure a positive product.\n- From row 3, we can select 4 at (3,0) and 5 at (3,1) to ensure a positive product.\n\nNow, let's check the columns:\n\n- Column 0: We have 8 at (0,0), 3 at (2,0), and 4 at (3,0) - product is positive.\n- Column 1: We have 3 at (0,1), 2 at (2,1), and 5 at (3,1) - product is positive.\n- Column 2: We have 7 at (1,2) - we need to select more numbers here.\n- Column 3: We have no selected numbers - we need to select numbers here.\n- Column 4: We have 5 at (0,4) and 3 at (1,4) - product is positive.\n\nLet's finalize the selection:\n\n- Select 8 at (2,3) to ensure a positive product in column 3.\n- Select -3 at (2,4) to ensure a positive product in column 2.\n\nNow, let's list the selected positions:\n\n- (0,0), (0,1), (0,4)\n- (1,2), (1,4)\n- (2,0), (2,1), (2,3), (2,4)\n\nLet's format the answer as requested:\n\n```\n<<<0 0, 0 1, 0 4, 1 2, 1 4, 2 0, 2 1, 2 3, 2 4>>>\n```\n\nThis selection ensures that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0."
