    "To solve this problem, we need to select 9 different numbers from the given 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number.\n\nThe grid is as follows:\n\n```\n1, -4, -1, 5, 2\n-7, -6, 7, 4, 2\n-2, -5, 4, -1, 6\n-3, -4, -7, 4, 4\n1, -7, 6, 5, 6\n```\n\nThe constraints imply that for each row and column, the product of the selected numbers must be positive. This means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers.\n\nLet's start by selecting the number at (0,4) and then try to find a combination of 8 other numbers that satisfy the conditions.\n\n### Strategy:\n1. Start with the given number at (0,4).\n2. Select numbers such that each row and column has an even number of negative numbers.\n3. Ensure that the total number of selected numbers is 9.\n\n### Steps:\n- We will iterate over possible combinations of numbers and check if they satisfy the conditions.\n- We will use a brute-force approach to try different combinations and check the product conditions.\n\nLet's write a Python script to find a valid combination of numbers.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [1, -4, -1, 5, 2],\n    [-7, -6, 7, 4, 2],\n    [-2, -5, 4, -1, 6],\n    [-3, -4, -7, 4, 4],\n    [1, -7, 6, 5, 6]\n]\n\n# Start with the given number at (0,4)\nselected_positions = [(0, 4)]\n\n# Function to check if the product of numbers in each row and column is positive\ndef is_valid_selection(positions):\n    row_products = [1] * 5\n    col_products = [1] * 5\n    for r, c in positions:\n        row_products[r] *= grid[r][c]\n        col_products[c] *= grid[r][c]\n    return all(p > 0 for p in row_products) and all(p > 0 for p in col_products)\n\n# Try to find a valid combination\nfor combination in itertools.combinations([(r, c) for r in range(5) for c in range(5) if (r, c) != (0, 4)], 8):\n    positions = selected_positions + list(combination)\n    if is_valid_selection(positions):\n        print(positions)\n        break\n```\n\nThis script will attempt to find a valid combination of 9 numbers, including the given number at (0,4), that satisfies the conditions. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code has successfully found a valid combination of positions that satisfy the conditions. The selected positions are:\n\n- (0, 4)\n- (0, 0)\n- (0, 1)\n- (0, 2)\n- (0, 3)\n- (1, 0)\n- (1, 1)\n- (3, 0)\n- (3, 2)\n\nThese positions ensure that the product of numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0.\n\n<<<0 4, 0 0, 0 1, 0 2, 0 3, 1 0, 1 1, 3 0, 3 2>>>"
