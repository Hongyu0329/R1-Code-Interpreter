    "To solve this problem, we need to select 12 different numbers from the 6x6 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 9 in the top-rightmost square (0,5) is the first selected number.\n\nThe constraints imply that for each row and column, the product of the selected numbers must be positive. This means that for each row and column, we must select an even number of negative numbers or all positive numbers.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Selection**: Start with the given number at position (0,5).\n\n2. **Selection Strategy**:\n   - We need to ensure that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive.\n   - We can achieve this by selecting an even number of negative numbers in each row and column or selecting all positive numbers.\n\n3. **Implementation**:\n   - We will iterate over the grid and select numbers while keeping track of the number of negative numbers selected in each row and column.\n   - We will ensure that the total number of selected numbers is 12.\n\n4. **Constraints**:\n   - We must select exactly 12 numbers.\n   - The product of selected numbers in each row and column must be positive.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\ngrid = [\n    [9, -11, -5, 1, 7, 9],\n    [-12, 10, 3, -5, 3, 6],\n    [12, -12, -5, 4, 11, 11],\n    [4, 12, 8, -6, 7, 7],\n    [12, 3, 4, 7, 12, 4],\n    [5, 12, 6, 1, 2, 9]\n]\n\nselected_positions = [(0, 5)]\nselected_numbers = [grid[0][5]]\n\n# Function to check if the product of selected numbers in a row or column is positive\ndef is_product_positive(selected, grid, row=None, col=None):\n    product = 1\n    if row is not None:\n        for c in range(6):\n            if (row, c) in selected:\n                product *= grid[row][c]\n    if col is not None:\n        for r in range(6):\n            if (r, col) in selected:\n                product *= grid[r][col]\n    return product > 0\n\n# Select numbers ensuring the product of each row and column is positive\nfor r in range(6):\n    for c in range(6):\n        if len(selected_positions) >= 12:\n            break\n        if (r, c) not in selected_positions:\n            selected_positions.append((r, c))\n            selected_numbers.append(grid[r][c])\n            # Check if the current selection maintains positive product\n            if not (is_product_positive(selected_positions, grid, row=r) and is_product_positive(selected_positions, grid, col=c)):\n                # If not, remove the last added number\n                selected_positions.pop()\n                selected_numbers.pop()\n\n# Ensure we have exactly 12 numbers\nwhile len(selected_positions) > 12:\n    selected_positions.pop()\n    selected_numbers.pop()\n\nprint(selected_positions)\n```\n\nThis code will select 12 numbers from the grid while ensuring the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided a list of selected positions. Let's verify the solution:\n\nThe selected positions are:\n- Row 0: (0, 5), (0, 0), (0, 3), (0, 4)\n- Row 1: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (1, 5)\n- Row 2: (2, 0), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5)\n\nFor each row and column, the product of the selected numbers should be positive. Let's check:\n\n- **Row 0**: 9, 9, 1, 7 (Product: 9 * 9 * 1 * 7 = 567, positive)\n- **Row 1**: 10, 3, 3, 6 (Product: 10 * 3 * 3 * 6 = 540, positive)\n- **Row 2**: 12, 4, 11, 11 (Product: 12 * 4 * 11 * 11 = 5808, positive)\n\n- **Column 0**: 9, 12 (Product: 9 * 12 = 108, positive)\n- **Column 1**: 10 (Product: 10, positive)\n- **Column 2**: 3 (Product: 3, positive)\n- **Column 3**: 1, 4 (Product: 1 * 4 = 4, positive)\n- **Column 4**: 7, 3, 11 (Product: 7 * 3 * 11 = 231, positive)\n- **Column 5**: 9, 6, 11 (Product: 9 * 6 * 11 = 594, positive)\n\nThe solution satisfies the condition that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 5, 0 0, 0 3, 0 4, 1 1, 1 2, 1 4, 1 5, 2 0, 2 3, 2 4, 2 5>>>"
