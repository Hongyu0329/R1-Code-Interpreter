  "question": "Given a 3*3 grid where each cell contains a number (between 1 to 4), you must select 4 different numbers from these cells. The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column should be less than or equal to 4. The numbers in the same row are separated by ',', and the coordinate system uses the top-left cell as the coordinate (1,1), with the horizontal coordinate under the top-left cell increasing and the vertical coordinate to the right of the top-left cell increasing.\nUsing the number 4 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) as the first selected number\n1, 4, 4\n2, 1, 4\n2, 3, 3\n\nReturn your answer with the format <<<list of selected number positions>>>, where each position is given as row column (0-based indices). For example, <<<0 3, 1 0, 2 4>>> means numbers selected are at positions (0,3), (1,0), and (2,4).",

    "To solve this problem, we need to select 4 different numbers from the given 3x3 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 4 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) is already selected.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have a 3x3 grid:\n   ```\n   1, 4, 4\n   2, 1, 4\n   2, 3, 3\n   ```\n\n2. The first selected number is 4 at position (0,2).\n\n3. We need to select 3 more numbers such that:\n   - The sum of the selected numbers in each row is ≤ 4.\n   - The sum of the selected numbers in each column is ≤ 4.\n   - All selected numbers are different.\n\n4. We need to ensure that the selected numbers are different, and we have to consider the constraints on the sums for rows and columns.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the grid and the constraints:\n\n- The first selected number is 4 at (0,2). This means the sum for row 0 and column 2 is already 4, so we cannot select any more numbers from row 0 or column 2.\n\n- We need to select numbers from the remaining positions: (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1), and (2,2).\n\n- We need to ensure that the selected numbers are different and that the sum constraints are satisfied.\n\nLet's write a Python script to find a valid selection of numbers.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# The grid\ngrid = [\n    [1, 4, 4],\n    [2, 1, 4],\n    [2, 3, 3]\n]\n\n# The first selected number is 4 at (0,2)\nselected_positions = [(0, 2)]\nselected_numbers = {4}\n\n# Possible positions to select from\npossible_positions = [(1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)]\n\n# Try all combinations of 3 positions from the possible positions\nfor positions in itertools.combinations(possible_positions, 3):\n    numbers = {grid[r][c] for r, c in positions}\n    if len(numbers) == 3 and not numbers.intersection(selected_numbers):\n        # Check row and column sums\n        row_sums = [0, 0, 0]\n        col_sums = [0, 0, 0]\n        \n        # Add the first selected number\n        row_sums[0] += 4\n        col_sums[2] += 4\n        \n        # Add the new selected numbers\n        for r, c in positions:\n            row_sums[r] += grid[r][c]\n            col_sums[c] += grid[r][c]\n        \n        # Check if all sums are <= 4\n        if all(s <= 4 for s in row_sums) and all(s <= 4 for s in col_sums):\n            # Found a valid selection\n            selected_positions.extend(positions)\n            break\n\n# Output the selected positions\nprint(selected_positions)\n```\n\nThis script will find a valid selection of numbers that satisfies all the constraints. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and found a valid selection of numbers that satisfies the constraints. The selected positions are:\n\n- (0, 2): The first selected number, which is 4.\n- (1, 0): The number 2.\n- (1, 1): The number 1.\n- (2, 1): The number 3.\n\nThese selections ensure that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4, and all selected numbers are different.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<0 2, 1 0, 1 1, 2 1>>>"
