  "question": "Given a 2*2 grid where each cell contains a number (between 1 to 3), you must select 3 different numbers from these cells. The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column should be less than or equal to 4.

    "To solve this problem, we need to select three different numbers from the given 2x2 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) is already selected.\n\nLet's break down the grid and the constraints:\n\nGrid:\n```\n(0,0) 1, (0,1) 2\n(1,0) 3, (1,1) 1\n```\n\nConstraints:\n1. We must select three different numbers.\n2. The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column should be ≤ 4.\n3. The number 2 at position (0,1) is already selected.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible selections:\n\n- We have already selected the number 2 at position (0,1).\n- We need to select two more numbers from the remaining three positions: (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1).\n\nLet's consider the possible selections and check the constraints:\n\n1. Select (0,0) and (1,1):\n   - Selected numbers: 2 (at 0,1), 1 (at 0,0), 1 (at 1,1)\n   - Row sums: Row 0: 1 + 2 = 3, Row 1: 1 = 1\n   - Column sums: Column 0: 1, Column 1: 2 + 1 = 3\n   - All sums are ≤ 4.\n\n2. Select (0,0) and (1,0):\n   - Selected numbers: 2 (at 0,1), 1 (at 0,0), 3 (at 1,0)\n   - Row sums: Row 0: 1 + 2 = 3, Row 1: 3 = 3\n   - Column sums: Column 0: 1 + 3 = 4, Column 1: 2\n   - All sums are ≤ 4.\n\n3. Select (1,0) and (1,1):\n   - Selected numbers: 2 (at 0,1), 3 (at 1,0), 1 (at 1,1)\n   - Row sums: Row 0: 2, Row 1: 3 + 1 = 4\n   - Column sums: Column 0: 3, Column 1: 2 + 1 = 3\n   - All sums are ≤ 4.\n\nAll three options satisfy the constraints, but we need to select one. Let's choose the first option for simplicity.\n\nLet's write the code to verify this selection:\n\n```python\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [1, 2],\n    [3, 1]\n]\n\n# Selected positions\nselected_positions = [(0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 1)]\n\n# Calculate row and column sums\nrow_sums = [0, 0]\ncol_sums = [0, 0]\n\nfor r, c in selected_positions:\n    row_sums[r] += grid[r][c]\n    col_sums[c] += grid[r][c]\n\n# Check if all sums are <= 4\nvalid = all(sum_val <= 4 for sum_val in row_sums + col_sums)\n\n# Output the result\nprint(selected_positions if valid else \"No valid selection\")\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the selection.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output indicates that the selected positions are valid according to the constraints. The selected positions are:\n\n- (0, 1): Number 2\n- (0, 0): Number 1\n- (1, 1): Number 1\n\nThese selections satisfy the condition that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 1, 0 0, 1 1>>>"
