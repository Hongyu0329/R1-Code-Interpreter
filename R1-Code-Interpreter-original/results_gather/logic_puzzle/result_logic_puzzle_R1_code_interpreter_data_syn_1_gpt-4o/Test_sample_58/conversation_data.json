    "To solve this problem, we need to select 9 different numbers from the given 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 8 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**: We have a 5x5 grid with numbers ranging from -7 to 8. We need to select 9 numbers such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is positive.\n\n2. **Constraints**: \n   - The product of numbers in each row and column must be greater than 0. This implies that each row and column must have an even number of negative numbers or no negative numbers at all.\n   - We must use the number 8 at position (0,4).\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Start by selecting the number 8 at position (0,4).\n   - Ensure that each row and column with selected numbers has an even number of negative numbers.\n   - Select numbers such that the total count is 9.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - We will use a brute-force approach to try different combinations of numbers and check if they satisfy the conditions.\n   - We will use Python to implement this logic and find a valid selection of numbers.\n\nLet's implement the code to find a valid selection of numbers:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [-2, 3, 7, 8, 8],\n    [-5, 1, 5, 8, 6],\n    [7, -3, -1, -4, 2],\n    [5, -4, -7, 3, 3],\n    [2, -4, 3, 1, 6]\n]\n\n# Initial selected position\ninitial_position = (0, 4)\n\n# Function to check if the product of numbers in each row and column is positive\ndef is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n    row_count = [0] * 5\n    col_count = [0] * 5\n    for r, c in selected_positions:\n        if grid[r][c] < 0:\n            row_count[r] += 1\n            col_count[c] += 1\n    # Check if each row and column has an even number of negative numbers\n    for count in row_count + col_count:\n        if count % 2 != 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Generate all possible combinations of 8 additional positions\nall_positions = [(r, c) for r in range(5) for c in range(5) if (r, c) != initial_position]\nfor combination in itertools.combinations(all_positions, 8):\n    selected_positions = [initial_position] + list(combination)\n    if is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n        print(selected_positions)\n        break\n```\n\nThis code will find a valid selection of 9 numbers from the grid, including the initial number at position (0,4), such that the product of numbers in each row and column is positive. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code has successfully found a valid selection of numbers from the grid. The selected positions are:\n\n- (0, 4): 8\n- (0, 1): 3\n- (0, 2): 7\n- (0, 3): 8\n- (1, 1): 1\n- (1, 2): 5\n- (1, 3): 8\n- (1, 4): 6\n- (2, 0): 7\n\nThese positions ensure that the product of numbers in each row and column is positive, satisfying the problem's constraints.\n\n<<<0 4, 0 1, 0 2, 0 3, 1 1, 1 2, 1 3, 1 4, 2 0>>>"
