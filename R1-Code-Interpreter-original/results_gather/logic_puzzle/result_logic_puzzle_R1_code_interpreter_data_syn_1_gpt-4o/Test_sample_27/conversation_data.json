  "question": "Given a 3*3 grid where each cell contains a number (between 1 to 4), you must select 4 different numbers from these cells. The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column should be less than or equal to 4. The numbers in the same row are separated by ',', and the coordinate system uses the top-left cell as the coordinate (1,1), with the horizontal coordinate under the top-left cell increasing and the vertical coordinate to the right of the top-left cell increasing.\nUsing the number 3 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) as the first selected number\n3, 4, 3\n3, 1, 2\n1, 2, 3\n\nReturn your answer with the format <<<list of selected number positions>>>, where each position is given as row column (0-based indices). For example, <<<0 3, 1 0, 2 4>>> means numbers selected are at positions (0,3), (1,0), and (2,4).",

    "To solve this problem, we need to select four different numbers from the given 3x3 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 3 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) is already selected.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**: \n   - The grid is:\n     ```\n     3, 4, 3\n     3, 1, 2\n     1, 2, 3\n     ```\n   - We need to select four different numbers, and one of them is already selected at position (0,2) with the value 3.\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - The sum of selected numbers in each row and each column should be less than or equal to 4.\n   - We need to select four different numbers.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Start with the selected number at (0,2).\n   - Try to select numbers such that the sum constraints are satisfied.\n   - Ensure that all selected numbers are different.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - We will iterate over possible selections and check if they satisfy the constraints.\n   - We will use a brute-force approach to try different combinations and check their validity.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find a valid selection of numbers.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [3, 4, 3],\n    [3, 1, 2],\n    [1, 2, 3]\n]\n\n# Pre-selected position\npre_selected = (0, 2)\n\n# Function to check if a selection is valid\ndef is_valid_selection(selection):\n    # Check if all numbers are different\n    selected_numbers = [grid[r][c] for r, c in selection]\n    if len(set(selected_numbers)) != len(selected_numbers):\n        return False\n    \n    # Check row and column sums\n    row_sums = [0] * 3\n    col_sums = [0] * 3\n    for r, c in selection:\n        row_sums[r] += grid[r][c]\n        col_sums[c] += grid[r][c]\n    \n    if any(s > 4 for s in row_sums) or any(s > 4 for s in col_sums):\n        return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# Generate all possible selections of 4 positions including the pre-selected one\nall_positions = [(r, c) for r in range(3) for c in range(3)]\nall_positions.remove(pre_selected)\n\n# Try all combinations\nfor selection in itertools.combinations(all_positions, 3):\n    selection = [pre_selected] + list(selection)\n    if is_valid_selection(selection):\n        # Format the output as required\n        result = ', '.join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in selection)\n        print(result)\n        break\n```\n\nThis code will find a valid selection of numbers that satisfies the given constraints. Let's execute it to get the result."
