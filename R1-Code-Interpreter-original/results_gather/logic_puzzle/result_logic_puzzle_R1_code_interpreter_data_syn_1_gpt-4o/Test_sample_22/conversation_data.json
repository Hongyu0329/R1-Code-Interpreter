  "question": "Given a 3*3 grid where each cell contains a number (between 1 to 4), you must select 4 different numbers from these cells. The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column should be less than or equal to 4. The numbers in the same row are separated by ',', and the coordinate system uses the top-left cell as the coordinate (1,1), with the horizontal coordinate under the top-left cell increasing and the vertical coordinate to the right of the top-left cell increasing.\nUsing the number 1 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) as the first selected number\n3, 4, 1\n4, 4, 2\n3, 3, 1\n\nReturn your answer with the format <<<list of selected number positions>>>, where each position is given as row column (0-based indices). For example, <<<0 3, 1 0, 2 4>>> means numbers selected are at positions (0,3), (1,0), and (2,4).",

    "To solve this problem, we need to select 4 different numbers from the given 3x3 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 1 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) is already selected.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have a 3x3 grid:\n   ```\n   3, 4, 1\n   4, 4, 2\n   3, 3, 1\n   ```\n\n2. The selected numbers must be different, and their sum in each row and column should be ≤ 4.\n\n3. We start with the number 1 at position (0,2).\n\n4. We need to select 3 more numbers from the grid, ensuring the constraints are met.\n\nLet's analyze the grid and constraints:\n\n- The number at (0,2) is 1.\n- We need to select numbers such that:\n  - The sum of numbers in each row ≤ 4.\n  - The sum of numbers in each column ≤ 4.\n\nGiven the constraints, let's try to find a combination of numbers that satisfies these conditions. We can use a brute-force approach to check possible combinations.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [3, 4, 1],\n    [4, 4, 2],\n    [3, 3, 1]\n]\n\n# Pre-select the number at (0,2)\nselected_positions = [(0, 2)]\nselected_numbers = [grid[0][2]]\n\n# All possible positions except the pre-selected one\nall_positions = [(i, j) for i in range(3) for j in range(3) if (i, j) != (0, 2)]\n\n# Function to check if a selection is valid\ndef is_valid_selection(positions):\n    # Check if all numbers are different\n    numbers = [grid[i][j] for i, j in positions]\n    if len(set(numbers)) != len(numbers):\n        return False\n    \n    # Check row and column sums\n    row_sums = [0] * 3\n    col_sums = [0] * 3\n    for i, j in positions:\n        row_sums[i] += grid[i][j]\n        col_sums[j] += grid[i][j]\n    \n    if all(s <= 4 for s in row_sums) and all(s <= 4 for s in col_sums):\n        return True\n    return False\n\n# Try all combinations of 3 positions from the remaining positions\nfor positions in itertools.combinations(all_positions, 3):\n    full_selection = selected_positions + list(positions)\n    if is_valid_selection(full_selection):\n        # Convert positions to the required format\n        result = ', '.join(f\"{i} {j}\" for i, j in full_selection)\n        print(result)\n        break\n```\n\nThe code will find a valid combination of positions that satisfy the constraints and print them in the required format. Let's execute the code to find the solution."
