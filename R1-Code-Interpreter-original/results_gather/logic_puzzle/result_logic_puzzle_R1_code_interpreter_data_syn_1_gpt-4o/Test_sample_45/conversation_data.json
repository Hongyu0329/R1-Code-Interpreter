    "To solve this problem, we need to select 6 different numbers from the given 4x4 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number -2 in the top-rightmost square (0,3) is already selected.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**: We have a 4x4 grid with numbers ranging from -4 to 7. The grid is as follows:\n   ```\n   1,  2,  4, -2\n  -4,  3,  3,  1\n   2,  1,  7,  2\n   7, -3,  7, -3\n   ```\n\n2. **Constraints**: \n   - We need to select 6 numbers.\n   - The product of selected numbers in each row and column must be greater than 0.\n   - The number -2 at position (0,3) is already selected.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - We need to ensure that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive. This means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n   - We will start by selecting the number -2 at (0,3) and then choose additional numbers to satisfy the constraints.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - We will iterate over possible combinations of numbers and check if they satisfy the constraints.\n   - We will use Python to automate the checking process.\n\nLet's write a Python script to find a valid selection of numbers.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [1, 2, 4, -2],\n    [-4, 3, 3, 1],\n    [2, 1, 7, 2],\n    [7, -3, 7, -3]\n]\n\n# Pre-select the number -2 at position (0,3)\nselected_positions = [(0, 3)]\n\n# Function to calculate the product of selected numbers in a row or column\ndef product_of_selected(selected, indices, is_row=True):\n    product = 1\n    for idx in indices:\n        if is_row:\n            product *= grid[selected[idx][0]][selected[idx][1]]\n        else:\n            product *= grid[selected[idx][1]][selected[idx][0]]\n    return product\n\n# Check if the selection is valid\ndef is_valid_selection(selected):\n    # Check each row\n    for row in range(4):\n        row_indices = [i for i, (r, c) in enumerate(selected) if r == row]\n        if len(row_indices) > 0 and product_of_selected(selected, row_indices) <= 0:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check each column\n    for col in range(4):\n        col_indices = [i for i, (r, c) in enumerate(selected) if c == col]\n        if len(col_indices) > 0 and product_of_selected(selected, col_indices, is_row=False) <= 0:\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# Try to find a valid selection\nfor comb in combinations([(r, c) for r in range(4) for c in range(4) if (r, c) != (0, 3)], 5):\n    selected = selected_positions + list(comb)\n    if is_valid_selection(selected):\n        print(selected)\n        break\n```\n\nThis script will find a valid selection of 6 numbers, including the pre-selected number -2 at position (0,3), that satisfies the constraints. Let's execute the code to find the solution."
