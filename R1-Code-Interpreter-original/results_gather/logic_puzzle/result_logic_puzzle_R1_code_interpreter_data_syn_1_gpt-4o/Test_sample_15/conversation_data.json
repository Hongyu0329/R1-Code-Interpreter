  "question": "Given a 2*2 grid where each cell contains a number (between 1 to 3), you must select 3 different numbers from these cells. The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column should be less than or equal to 4. The numbers in the same row are separated by ',', and the coordinate system uses the top-left cell as the coordinate (1,1), with the horizontal coordinate under the top-left cell increasing and the vertical coordinate to the right of the top-left cell increasing.\nUsing the number 1 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) as the first selected number\n2, 1\n1, 3\n\nReturn your answer with the format <<<list of selected number positions>>>, where each position is given as row column (0-based indices).

    "To solve this problem, we need to select three different numbers from the given 2x2 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 1 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) is already selected.\n\nThe grid is as follows:\n```\n2, 1\n1, 3\n```\n\nThe coordinates for the grid are:\n- (0,0) = 2\n- (0,1) = 1 (already selected)\n- (1,0) = 1\n- (1,1) = 3\n\nWe need to select two more numbers from the remaining cells: (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1).\n\nLet's analyze the possible selections:\n1. We have already selected 1 at (0,1).\n2. We need to select two more numbers such that the sum in each row and column is â‰¤ 4.\n\nLet's consider the possible combinations:\n- If we select 2 at (0,0) and 1 at (1,0), the sums would be:\n  - Row 0: 2 + 1 = 3\n  - Row 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n  - Column 0: 2 + 1 = 3\n  - Column 1: 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThis combination satisfies the condition for both rows and columns.\n\nLet's verify this with a code to ensure the selection is correct:\n\n```python\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [2, 1],\n    [1, 3]\n]\n\n# Pre-selected number\nselected_positions = [(0, 1)]  # (0,1) is already selected\n\n# Check possible selections\ndef is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n    # Calculate sums for rows and columns\n    row_sums = [0, 0]\n    col_sums = [0, 0]\n    \n    for r, c in selected_positions:\n        row_sums[r] += grid[r][c]\n        col_sums[c] += grid[r][c]\n    \n    # Check if all sums are <= 4\n    return all(s <= 4 for s in row_sums + col_sums)\n\n# Try selecting (0,0) and (1,0)\nselected_positions.append((0, 0))\nselected_positions.append((1, 0))\n\n# Check if this selection is valid\nif is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n    print(selected_positions)\nelse:\n    print(\"No valid selection found\")\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to verify the selection.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the selected positions as `[(0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0)]`. This means the numbers selected are at positions (0,1), (0,0), and (1,0).\n\nThe selection satisfies the condition that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 1, 0 0, 1 0>>>"
