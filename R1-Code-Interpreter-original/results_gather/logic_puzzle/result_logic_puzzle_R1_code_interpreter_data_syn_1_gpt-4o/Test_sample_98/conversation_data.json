    "To solve this problem, we need to select 16 different numbers from the given 7x7 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number -7 in the top-rightmost square (0,6) is the first selected number.\n\nThe constraints imply that we need to ensure that each row and column of the selected numbers has an even number of negative numbers to ensure a positive product. Since we have already selected one negative number (-7), we need to carefully select the remaining numbers to satisfy the condition.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Selection**: Start with the given number -7 at position (0,6).\n\n2. **Selection Strategy**:\n   - We need to select 15 more numbers.\n   - Ensure that each row and column with selected numbers has an even number of negative numbers.\n   - Try to balance the selection of positive and negative numbers across rows and columns.\n\n3. **Implementation**:\n   - Use a greedy approach to select numbers, ensuring the condition of positive product is met.\n   - Keep track of the number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n\nLet's implement this strategy using Python code to find a valid selection of numbers.\n\n```python\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [-13, 6, 12, 14, 12, -3, -7],\n    [13, -13, 1, 13, 13, 2, -10],\n    [2, 6, -9, 13, 1, 10, 12],\n    [8, -6, 13, 8, 14, 9, 13],\n    [3, 10, -14, 10, -6, 5, 11],\n    [-9, 11, 4, 5, 7, -11, -10],\n    [-5, 1, 4, 13, 14, 2, 12]\n]\n\n# Start with the given number -7 at position (0,6)\nselected_positions = [(0, 6)]\n\n# Function to check if the current selection is valid\ndef is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n    row_neg_count = [0] * 7\n    col_neg_count = [0] * 7\n    for r, c in selected_positions:\n        if grid[r][c] < 0:\n            row_neg_count[r] += 1\n            col_neg_count[c] += 1\n    # Check if all rows and columns have even negative counts\n    for count in row_neg_count + col_neg_count:\n        if count % 2 != 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Try to select 15 more numbers\nfor r in range(7):\n    for c in range(7):\n        if (r, c) != (0, 6) and len(selected_positions) < 16:\n            selected_positions.append((r, c))\n            if not is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n                selected_positions.pop()\n\n# Print the selected positions\nprint(selected_positions)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to select 16 numbers from the grid, ensuring that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is positive.
