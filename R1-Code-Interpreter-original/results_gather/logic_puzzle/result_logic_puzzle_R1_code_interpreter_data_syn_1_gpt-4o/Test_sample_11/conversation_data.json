  "question": "Given a 2*2 grid where each cell contains a number (between 1 to 3), you must select 3 different numbers from these cells. The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column should be less than or equal to 4. The numbers in the same row are separated by ',', and the coordinate system uses the top-left cell as the coordinate (1,1), with the horizontal coordinate under the top-left cell increasing and the vertical coordinate to the right of the top-left cell increasing.\nUsing the number 1 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) as the first selected number\n2, 1\n1, 3\n\nReturn your answer with the format <<<list of selected number positions>>>, where each position is given as row column (0-based indices). For example, <<<0 3, 1 0, 2 4>>> means numbers selected are at positions (0,3), (1,0), and (2,4).",

    "To solve this problem, we need to select three different numbers from the given 2x2 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 1 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) is already selected.\n\nThe grid is as follows:\n```\n2, 1\n1, 3\n```\n\nThe coordinates for each cell are:\n- (0,0): 2\n- (0,1): 1 (already selected)\n- (1,0): 1\n- (1,1): 3\n\nWe need to select two more numbers from the remaining cells: (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1).\n\nLet's consider the constraints:\n1. The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column should be less than or equal to 4.\n2. We need to select three different numbers.\n\nSince (0,1) is already selected, we have:\n- Row 0: 1 (from (0,1))\n- Column 1: 1 (from (0,1))\n\nNow, let's try to select two more numbers such that the constraints are satisfied.\n\nWe can use a brute-force approach to try all combinations of selecting two more numbers from the remaining cells and check if they satisfy the constraints.\n\nLet's write a Python script to find the valid selection of numbers.\n\n```python\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [2, 1],\n    [1, 3]\n]\n\n# Already selected number\nselected_positions = [(0, 1)]\n\n# Function to check if the selection is valid\ndef is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n    row_sums = [0, 0]\n    col_sums = [0, 0]\n    \n    for r, c in selected_positions:\n        row_sums[r] += grid[r][c]\n        col_sums[c] += grid[r][c]\n    \n    return all(s <= 4 for s in row_sums) and all(s <= 4 for s in col_sums)\n\n# Try all combinations of selecting two more numbers\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Remaining positions to select from\nremaining_positions = [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1)]\n\n# Check all combinations of selecting two more numbers\nfor combo in combinations(remaining_positions, 2):\n    current_selection = selected_positions + list(combo)\n    if is_valid_selection(current_selection):\n        print(current_selection)\n        break\n```\n\nThis script will output the valid selection of positions that satisfy the constraints. Let's execute it to find the solution.",
    "The code has successfully found a valid selection of positions that satisfy the constraints. The selected positions are:\n\n- (0, 1): 1 (already selected)\n- (0, 0): 2\n- (1, 0): 1\n\nLet's verify the solution:\n\n- Row 0: 2 (from (0,0)) + 1 (from (0,1)) = 3, which is ≤ 4\n- Row 1: 1 (from (1,0)) = 1, which is ≤ 4\n- Column 0: 2 (from (0,0)) + 1 (from (1,0)) = 3, which is ≤ 4\n- Column 1: 1 (from (0,1)) = 1, which is ≤ 4\n\nAll constraints are satisfied, and we have selected three different numbers.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 1, 0 0, 1 0>>>"
