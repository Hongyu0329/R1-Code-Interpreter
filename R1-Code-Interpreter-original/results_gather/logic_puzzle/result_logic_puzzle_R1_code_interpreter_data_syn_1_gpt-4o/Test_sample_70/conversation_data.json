    "To solve this problem, we need to select 10 different numbers from the given 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 9 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Constraints**:\n   - We need to select 10 different numbers.\n   - The product of selected numbers in each row and column must be greater than 0.\n   - The number 9 at position (0,4) is already selected.\n\n2. **Grid Analysis**:\n   - The grid is:\n     ```\n     -2, -3, -8, 8, 9\n     -5, 7, -3, 3, 2\n     -6, -2, 4, 6, -8\n     8, -10, 10, 8, -6\n     5, -9, 8, -10, -4\n     ```\n   - We need to ensure that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive. This means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Start with the given number 9 at (0,4).\n   - Select numbers such that each row and column has an even number of negative numbers.\n   - Ensure that the total count of selected numbers is 10.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - We will use a brute-force approach to try different combinations and check the conditions.\n   - We will use Python to automate the selection and checking process.\n\nLet's write a Python script to find a valid selection of numbers.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [-2, -3, -8, 8, 9],\n    [-5, 7, -3, 3, 2],\n    [-6, -2, 4, 6, -8],\n    [8, -10, 10, 8, -6],\n    [5, -9, 8, -10, -4]\n]\n\n# Initial selected position\ninitial_position = (0, 4)\n\n# Function to check if the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive\ndef is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n    row_products = [1] * 5\n    col_products = [1] * 5\n    \n    for r, c in selected_positions:\n        row_products[r] *= grid[r][c]\n        col_products[c] *= grid[r][c]\n    \n    return all(p > 0 for p in row_products) and all(p > 0 for p in col_products)\n\n# Generate all possible combinations of 9 additional positions\nall_positions = [(r, c) for r in range(5) for c in range(5) if (r, c) != initial_position]\ncombinations = itertools.combinations(all_positions, 9)\n\n# Find a valid combination\nfor combo in combinations:\n    selected_positions = [initial_position] + list(combo)\n    if is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n        result = selected_positions\n        break\n\n# Format the result\nformatted_result = ', '.join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in result)\nprint(formatted_result)\n```\n\nThis script will find a valid selection of 10 numbers from the grid that satisfies the given conditions. Let's execute the code to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned a valid selection of numbers from the grid. The selected positions are:\n\n<<<0 4, 0 0, 0 1, 0 3, 1 1, 1 3, 1 4, 2 0, 2 1, 2 2>>>"
