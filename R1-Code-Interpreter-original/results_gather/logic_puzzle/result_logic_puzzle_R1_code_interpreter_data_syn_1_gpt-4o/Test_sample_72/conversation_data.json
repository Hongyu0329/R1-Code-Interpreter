  "question": "Given a 5*5 grid where each cell contains a number (between -10 to 10), you must select 10 different numbers from these cells. The product of each row and column of the selected number must be greater than 0.

    "To solve this problem, we need to select 10 different numbers from the given 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are also required to use the number 4 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) as the first selected number.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**: We have a 5x5 grid with numbers ranging from -10 to 10. We need to ensure that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive.\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - We must select exactly 10 numbers.\n   - The product of selected numbers in each row and column must be positive.\n   - The number at position (0,4) must be included.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Start by selecting the number at (0,4).\n   - Ensure that each row and column with selected numbers has a positive product. This means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column or no negative numbers at all.\n   - We need to carefully choose numbers to satisfy these conditions.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - We will use a brute-force approach to try different combinations of numbers and check if they satisfy the conditions.\n   - We will use Python to automate the selection and checking process.\n\nLet's write a Python script to find a valid selection of numbers.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [7, 8, 1, 9, 4],\n    [-6, 1, 6, 5, 6],\n    [-7, 8, 5, -9, 6],\n    [10, 1, 2, 3, 9],\n    [5, 3, -10, 6, 10]\n]\n\n# Pre-select the number at (0,4)\nselected_positions = [(0, 4)]\n\n# Function to check if the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive\ndef is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n    row_products = [1] * 5\n    col_products = [1] * 5\n    for r, c in selected_positions:\n        row_products[r] *= grid[r][c]\n        col_products[c] *= grid[r][c]\n    return all(p > 0 for p in row_products) and all(p > 0 for p in col_products)\n\n# Try to find a valid selection\nfor positions in itertools.combinations([(r, c) for r in range(5) for c in range(5) if (r, c) != (0, 4)], 9):\n    current_selection = selected_positions + list(positions)\n    if is_valid_selection(current_selection):\n        print(current_selection)\n        break\n```\n\nThis script will attempt to find a valid selection of 10 numbers, including the pre-selected number at (0,4), that satisfies the condition of having a positive product in each row and column. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code successfully found a valid selection of numbers that satisfies the conditions. The selected positions are:\n\n- (0, 4)\n- (0, 0)\n- (0, 1)\n- (0, 2)\n- (0, 3)\n- (1, 1)\n- (1, 2)\n- (1, 3)\n- (1, 4)\n- (2, 1)\n\nThese positions ensure that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive. \n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<0 4, 0 0, 0 1, 0 2, 0 3, 1 1, 1 2, 1 3, 1 4, 2 1>>>"
