  "question": "Given a 3*3 grid where each cell contains a number (between 1 to 4), you must select 4 different numbers from these cells. The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column should be less than or equal to 4. The numbers in the same row are separated by ',', and the coordinate system uses the top-left cell as the coordinate (1,1), with the horizontal coordinate under the top-left cell increasing and the vertical coordinate to the right of the top-left cell increasing.\nUsing the number 3 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) as the first selected number\n3, 1, 3\n1, 1, 2\n4, 3, 4\n\nReturn your answer with the format <<<list of selected number positions>>>, where each position is given as row column (0-based indices).

    "To solve this problem, we need to select 4 different numbers from the given 3x3 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 3 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) is already selected.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Grid Representation**: \n   ```\n   3, 1, 3\n   1, 1, 2\n   4, 3, 4\n   ```\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - We need to select 4 different numbers.\n   - The sum of selected numbers in each row and column should be â‰¤ 4.\n   - The number at position (0,2) is already selected.\n\n3. **Approach**:\n   - Start with the number at (0,2).\n   - Try to select numbers such that the sum constraints are satisfied.\n   - Ensure that all selected numbers are different.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - We will iterate over possible combinations of numbers and check if they satisfy the constraints.\n   - We will use Python to automate the checking process.\n\nLet's write a Python script to find the solution:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [3, 1, 3],\n    [1, 1, 2],\n    [4, 3, 4]\n]\n\n# Pre-select the number at (0, 2)\nselected_positions = [(0, 2)]\nselected_numbers = {grid[0][2]}\n\n# Function to check if the selection is valid\ndef is_valid_selection(positions):\n    row_sums = [0] * 3\n    col_sums = [0] * 3\n    numbers = set()\n    \n    for r, c in positions:\n        num = grid[r][c]\n        if num in numbers:\n            return False\n        numbers.add(num)\n        row_sums[r] += num\n        col_sums[c] += num\n    \n    return all(s <= 4 for s in row_sums) and all(s <= 4 for s in col_sums)\n\n# Try to find a valid selection\nfor positions in itertools.combinations([(r, c) for r in range(3) for c in range(3) if (r, c) != (0, 2)], 3):\n    positions = selected_positions + list(positions)\n    if is_valid_selection(positions):\n        print(positions)\n        break\n```\n\nThis code will find a valid selection of positions that satisfy the constraints. Let's execute it to see the result."

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation.
