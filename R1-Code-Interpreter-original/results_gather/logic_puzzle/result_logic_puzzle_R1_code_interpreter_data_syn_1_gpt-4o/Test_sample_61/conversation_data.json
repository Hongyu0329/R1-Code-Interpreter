    "To solve this problem, we need to select 9 different numbers from the given 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number -6 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number.\n\nThe grid is as follows:\n\n```\n-8,  8, -4,  1, -6\n-7,  7, -1,  5,  4\n 3, -1, -3,  3, -2\n 2,  4,  8,  8, -3\n-6, -7, -7, -6,  3\n```\n\nThe constraints imply that for each row and column containing selected numbers, the product of those numbers must be positive. This means that each row and column must contain an even number of negative numbers or no negative numbers at all.\n\nGiven that we have already selected -6 at position (0,4), we need to carefully choose the remaining 8 numbers to satisfy the conditions.\n\nLet's start by selecting numbers and checking the conditions:\n\n1. We have already selected (0,4) with value -6.\n2. We need to select 8 more numbers.\n\nTo ensure the product of each row and column is positive, we can try to balance the number of negative numbers in each row and column. We will use a brute-force approach to find a valid selection.\n\nLet's write a Python script to help us find a valid selection of numbers:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [-8,  8, -4,  1, -6],\n    [-7,  7, -1,  5,  4],\n    [ 3, -1, -3,  3, -2],\n    [ 2,  4,  8,  8, -3],\n    [-6, -7, -7, -6,  3]\n]\n\n# Pre-select the first number\nselected_positions = [(0, 4)]\n\n# Function to calculate the product of selected numbers in a row or column\ndef product_of_selected(selected, indices, is_row=True):\n    prod = 1\n    for idx in indices:\n        if is_row:\n            prod *= grid[selected[idx][0]][selected[idx][1]]\n        else:\n            prod *= grid[selected[idx][1]][selected[idx][0]]\n    return prod\n\n# Check if the selection is valid\ndef is_valid_selection(selected):\n    # Check rows\n    for row in range(5):\n        row_indices = [i for i, (r, c) in enumerate(selected) if r == row]\n        if row_indices and product_of_selected(selected, row_indices, is_row=True) <= 0:\n            return False\n    # Check columns\n    for col in range(5):\n        col_indices = [i for i, (r, c) in enumerate(selected) if c == col]\n        if col_indices and product_of_selected(selected, col_indices, is_row=False) <= 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Try to find a valid selection\nfor combination in itertools.combinations([(r, c) for r in range(5) for c in range(5) if (r, c) != (0, 4)], 8):\n    selected = selected_positions + list(combination)\n    if is_valid_selection(selected):\n        print(selected)\n        break\n```\n\nThis script will attempt to find a valid selection of 9 numbers, including the pre-selected number at (0,4), such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is positive. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code has successfully found a valid selection of numbers that satisfy the given conditions. The selected positions are:\n\n- (0, 4) with value -6\n- (0, 0) with value -8\n- (0, 1) with value 8\n- (0, 3) with value 1\n- (1, 1) with value 7\n- (1, 3) with value 5\n- (2, 0) with value 3\n- (2, 1) with value -1\n- (2, 4) with value -2\n\nThese selections ensure that the product of each row and column containing these numbers is greater than 0.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 4, 0 0, 0 1, 0 3, 1 1, 1 3, 2 0, 2 1, 2 4>>>"
