    "To solve this problem, we need to select 12 different numbers from the 6x6 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We start with the number 2 at position (0,5) as the first selected number.\n\n### Reasoning Process:\n\n1. **Understanding the Grid and Constraints:**\n   - We have a 6x6 grid with numbers ranging from -11 to 12.\n   - We need to select 12 numbers such that the product of numbers in each row and column is positive.\n   - We start with the number 2 at position (0,5).\n\n2. **Initial Considerations:**\n   - A positive product means an even number of negative numbers or all positive numbers in each row and column.\n   - We need to carefully select numbers to ensure the product condition is met.\n\n3. **Strategy:**\n   - Start with the given number at (0,5).\n   - Select numbers ensuring that each row and column has an even number of negative numbers or all positive numbers.\n   - Check the product condition for each row and column as we select numbers.\n\n4. **Implementation:**\n   - Use a backtracking approach to try different combinations of numbers.\n   - Ensure that the selected numbers meet the product condition for each row and column.\n\nLet's implement this strategy using Python code to find a valid selection of numbers.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# The grid\ngrid = [\n    [10, 3, 9, 12, 1, 2],\n    [8, 10, -10, -4, 12, -8],\n    [6, 12, 12, 9, 11, 10],\n    [4, 5, 7, 8, -8, 11],\n    [1, -5, 8, -2, 6, 11],\n    [6, -11, -3, 11, 9, 3]\n]\n\n# Start with the given number at (0,5)\nselected_positions = [(0, 5)]\n\n# Function to check if the product of selected numbers in a row or column is positive\ndef is_product_positive(selected_positions):\n    # Check rows\n    for i in range(6):\n        product = 1\n        for j in range(6):\n            if (i, j) in selected_positions:\n                product *= grid[i][j]\n        if product <= 0:\n            return False\n\n    # Check columns\n    for j in range(6):\n        product = 1\n        for i in range(6):\n            if (i, j) in selected_positions:\n                product *= grid[i][j]\n        if product <= 0:\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\n# Try to find a valid selection of 12 numbers\ndef find_selection():\n    # Generate all possible positions except the starting one\n    all_positions = [(i, j) for i in range(6) for j in range(6) if (i, j) != (0, 5)]\n    \n    # Try all combinations of 11 positions (since we already have one)\n    for combination in itertools.combinations(all_positions, 11):\n        current_selection = selected_positions + list(combination)\n        if is_product_positive(current_selection):\n            return current_selection\n\n# Find a valid selection\nvalid_selection = find_selection()\n\n# Format the output\noutput = ', '.join(f\"{i} {j}\" for i, j in valid_selection)\nprint(f\"<<<{output}>>>\")\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to find a valid selection of 12 numbers that satisfy the given conditions. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code has successfully found a valid selection of 12 numbers from the grid that satisfies the condition of having a positive product for each row and column.
