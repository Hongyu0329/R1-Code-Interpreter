The product of each row and column of the selected number must be greater than 0.

    "To solve this problem, we need to select 6 different numbers from the given 4x4 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number at position (0,3) is -1, and it must be included in our selection.\n\nThe grid is as follows:\n\n```\n8, 6, 2, -1\n1, 8, -3, 5\n4, -4, 1, 4\n8, 7, -5, 3\n```\n\nThe coordinates of the grid are:\n\n```\n(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3)\n(1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)\n(2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)\n(3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)\n```\n\nWe need to ensure that the product of the selected numbers in each row and column is greater than 0. This means that the product must be positive, which can be achieved if there is an even number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n\nSince we have already selected -1 at (0,3), we need to carefully choose the remaining 5 numbers to satisfy the condition.\n\nLet's try to find a solution by selecting numbers that will satisfy the condition:\n\n1. Select -1 at (0,3).\n2. We need to select numbers such that each row and column has an even number of negative numbers.\n\nLet's write a Python script to help us find a valid selection of numbers.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [8, 6, 2, -1],\n    [1, 8, -3, 5],\n    [4, -4, 1, 4],\n    [8, 7, -5, 3]\n]\n\n# Pre-select the number at (0,3)\nselected_positions = [(0, 3)]\n\n# Function to check if the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive\ndef is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n    row_products = [1] * 4\n    col_products = [1] * 4\n    \n    for r, c in selected_positions:\n        row_products[r] *= grid[r][c]\n        col_products[c] *= grid[r][c]\n    \n    return all(p > 0 for p in row_products) and all(p > 0 for p in col_products)\n\n# Try all combinations of 5 more positions\nall_positions = [(r, c) for r in range(4) for c in range(4) if (r, c) != (0, 3)]\nfor combination in itertools.combinations(all_positions, 5):\n    current_selection = selected_positions + list(combination)\n    if is_valid_selection(current_selection):\n        print(current_selection)\n        break\n```\n\nThis script will try all combinations of 5 additional positions and check if the product of the selected numbers in each row and column is positive. If a valid selection is found, it will print the positions. Let's execute the code to find the solution."
