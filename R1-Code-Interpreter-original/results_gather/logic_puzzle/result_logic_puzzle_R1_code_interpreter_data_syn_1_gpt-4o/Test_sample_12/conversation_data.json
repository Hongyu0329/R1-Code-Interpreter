  "question": "Given a 2*2 grid where each cell contains a number (between 1 to 3), you must select 3 different numbers from these cells. The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column should be less than or equal to 4. The numbers in the same row are separated by ',', and the coordinate system uses the top-left cell as the coordinate (1,1), with the horizontal coordinate under the top-left cell increasing and the vertical coordinate to the right of the top-left cell increasing.\nUsing the number 3 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) as the first selected number\n1, 3\n1, 2\n\nReturn your answer with the format <<<list of selected number positions>>>, where each position is given as row column (0-based indices). For example, <<<0 3, 1 0, 2 4>>> means numbers selected are at positions (0,3), (1,0), and (2,4).",

    "To solve this problem, we need to select three different numbers from the given 2x2 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 3 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) is already selected.\n\nThe grid is as follows:\n```\n1, 3\n1, 2\n```\n\nThe coordinates for the grid are:\n- (0,0) = 1\n- (0,1) = 3\n- (1,0) = 1\n- (1,1) = 2\n\nWe need to select two more numbers from the remaining cells: (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1).\n\nLet's analyze the constraints:\n1. The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column should be less than or equal to 4.\n2. We have already selected the number 3 at position (0,1).\n\nNow, let's consider the possible selections:\n- If we select the number at (0,0) which is 1, the sum of the first row becomes 1 + 3 = 4, which is valid.\n- If we select the number at (1,0) which is 1, the sum of the first column becomes 1 + 3 = 4, which is valid.\n- If we select the number at (1,1) which is 2, the sum of the second column becomes 3 + 2 = 5, which is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the valid selections are:\n- (0,0) = 1\n- (1,0) = 1\n\nLet's verify:\n- Row 0: 1 (at 0,0) + 3 (at 0,1) = 4\n- Row 1: 1 (at 1,0) = 1\n- Column 0: 1 (at 0,0) + 1 (at 1,0) = 2\n- Column 1: 3 (at 0,1) = 3\n\nAll sums are less than or equal to 4, so this selection is valid.\n\nThus, the selected positions are (0,1), (0,0), and (1,0).\n\n<<<0 1, 0 0, 1 0>>>"
