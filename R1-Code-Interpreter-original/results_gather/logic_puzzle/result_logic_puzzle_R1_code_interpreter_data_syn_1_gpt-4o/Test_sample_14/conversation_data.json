    "To solve this problem, we need to select three different numbers from the given 2x2 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 1 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) is already selected.\n\nThe grid is as follows:\n```\n2, 1\n3, 1\n```\n\nThe coordinates of the grid are:\n- (0,0) -> 2\n- (0,1) -> 1 (already selected)\n- (1,0) -> 3\n- (1,1) -> 1\n\nWe need to select two more numbers from the remaining three positions: (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1).\n\nLet's analyze the possible selections:\n1. If we select (0,0) and (1,0), the numbers are 2 and 3. The sums would be:\n   - Row 0: 2 + 1 = 3\n   - Row 1: 3 + 1 = 4\n   - Column 0: 2 + 3 = 5 (exceeds 4)\n   - Column 1: 1 + 1 = 2\n\n2. If we select (0,0) and (1,1), the numbers are 2 and 1. The sums would be:\n   - Row 0: 2 + 1 = 3\n   - Row 1: 1 + 1 = 2\n   - Column 0: 2 + 1 = 3\n   - Column 1: 1 + 1 = 2\n\n3. If we select (1,0) and (1,1), the numbers are 3 and 1. The sums would be:\n   - Row 0: 1 + 3 = 4\n   - Row 1: 3 + 1 = 4\n   - Column 0: 3 + 1 = 4\n   - Column 1: 1 + 1 = 2\n\nThe only valid selection that satisfies the condition of the sum being less than or equal to 4 for each row and column is the second option: selecting (0,0) and (1,1).\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script to ensure the logic is correct.\n\n```python\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [2, 1],\n    [3, 1]\n]\n\n# Pre-selected position\nselected_positions = [(0, 1)]\n\n# Possible positions to select from\npossible_positions = [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1)]\n\n# Function to check if the selection is valid\ndef is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n    row_sums = [0, 0]\n    col_sums = [0, 0]\n    \n    for r, c in selected_positions:\n        row_sums[r] += grid[r][c]\n        col_sums[c] += grid[r][c]\n    \n    return all(s <= 4 for s in row_sums + col_sums)\n\n# Try all combinations of two additional selections\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\nfor additional_selection in combinations(possible_positions, 2):\n    current_selection = selected_positions + list(additional_selection)\n    if is_valid_selection(current_selection):\n        print(current_selection)\n        break\n```\n\nThe code will output the valid selection of positions. Let's execute it to confirm our reasoning.",
    "The code output confirms our reasoning that the valid selection of positions is \\((0, 1)\\), \\((0, 0)\\), and \\((1, 1)\\). This selection satisfies the condition that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 1, 0 0, 1 1>>>"
