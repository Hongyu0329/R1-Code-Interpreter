    "To solve this problem, we need to select 6 different numbers from the given 4x4 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 6 in the top-rightmost square (0,3) is already selected.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**: \n   - The grid is:\n     ```\n     7, -3, 5, 6\n     6, 6, -3, 2\n     4, 4, 5, -4\n     2, 8, 8, 7\n     ```\n   - We need to select 6 numbers, and one of them is already selected at position (0,3).\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - The product of selected numbers in each row and column must be greater than 0.\n   - This implies that for each row and column with selected numbers, the product must be positive.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - We need to ensure that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive.\n   - We can achieve this by ensuring an even number of negative numbers in each row and column with selected numbers.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - Start with the number at (0,3).\n   - Select additional numbers ensuring the product condition is met.\n\nLet's write a Python script to find a valid selection of numbers.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [7, -3, 5, 6],\n    [6, 6, -3, 2],\n    [4, 4, 5, -4],\n    [2, 8, 8, 7]\n]\n\n# Pre-select the number at (0,3)\nselected_positions = [(0, 3)]\n\n# Function to check if the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive\ndef is_valid_selection(positions):\n    row_products = [1] * 4\n    col_products = [1] * 4\n    \n    for r, c in positions:\n        row_products[r] *= grid[r][c]\n        col_products[c] *= grid[r][c]\n    \n    return all(p > 0 for p in row_products if p != 1) and all(p > 0 for p in col_products if p != 1)\n\n# Try to find a valid selection\nfor positions in itertools.combinations([(r, c) for r in range(4) for c in range(4) if (r, c) != (0, 3)], 5):\n    positions = selected_positions + list(positions)\n    if is_valid_selection(positions):\n        print(positions)\n        break\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to find a valid selection of 6 numbers, including the pre-selected number at (0,3), such that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code execution has provided us with a valid selection of positions. Let's verify the solution:\n\n1. **Selected Positions**: \n   - (0, 3): 6\n   - (0, 0): 7\n   - (0, 2): 5\n   - (1, 0): 6\n   - (1, 1): 6\n   - (1, 3): 2\n\n2. **Verification**:\n   - **Row 0**: 7, 5, 6 (Product = 7 * 5 * 6 = 210, which is positive)\n   - **Row 1**: 6, 6, 2 (Product = 6 * 6 * 2 = 72, which is positive)\n   - **Column 0**: 7, 6 (Product = 7 * 6 = 42, which is positive)\n   - **Column 1**: 6 (Product = 6, which is positive)\n   - **Column 2**: 5 (Product = 5, which is positive)\n   - **Column 3**: 6, 2 (Product = 6 * 2 = 12, which is positive)\n\nAll conditions are satisfied, and the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 3, 0 0, 0 2, 1 0, 1 1, 1 3>>>"
