    "To solve this problem, we need to select 12 different numbers from the given 6x6 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 10 in the top-rightmost square (0,5) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**: We have a 6x6 grid with numbers ranging from -12 to 12. We need to select 12 numbers such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is positive.\n\n2. **Initial Selection**: We start with the number 10 at position (0,5).\n\n3. **Product Condition**: For the product of numbers in each row and column to be positive, we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers.\n\n4. **Selection Strategy**: We need to carefully select numbers to ensure the product condition is met. We can start by selecting numbers in a way that balances the number of negative and positive numbers in each row and column.\n\n5. **Implementation**: We will use a backtracking approach to try different combinations of numbers and check if they satisfy the conditions.\n\nLet's implement the solution using Python code to find the positions of the selected numbers.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [12, 2, 8, 9, 4, 10],\n    [-9, -12, 10, 2, -8, 7],\n    [-4, 9, 4, -8, -10, -11],\n    [-4, 12, -1, 11, -5, -2],\n    [-1, 8, 11, 3, -6, 2],\n    [11, -6, -12, -11, 4, 4]\n]\n\n# Initial selected position\nselected_positions = [(0, 5)]\n\n# Function to check if the product of numbers in each row and column is positive\ndef is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n    row_products = [1] * 6\n    col_products = [1] * 6\n    for r, c in selected_positions:\n        row_products[r] *= grid[r][c]\n        col_products[c] *= grid[r][c]\n    return all(p > 0 for p in row_products) and all(p > 0 for p in col_products)\n\n# Try to find a valid selection of 12 numbers\ndef find_selection():\n    # Generate all possible positions except the initial one\n    all_positions = [(r, c) for r in range(6) for c in range(6) if (r, c) != (0, 5)]\n    \n    # Try all combinations of 11 positions from the remaining positions\n    for combination in itertools.combinations(all_positions, 11):\n        current_selection = selected_positions + list(combination)\n        if is_valid_selection(current_selection):\n            return current_selection\n    return None\n\n# Find the selection\nselection = find_selection()\n\n# Format the output\nif selection:\n    result = ', '.join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in selection)\n    print(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No valid selection found.\")\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to find a valid selection of 12 numbers that satisfy the given conditions. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code has successfully found a valid selection of 12 numbers from the grid that satisfies the condition that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0.
