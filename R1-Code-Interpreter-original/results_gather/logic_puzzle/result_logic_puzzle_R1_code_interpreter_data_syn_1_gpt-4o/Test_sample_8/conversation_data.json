  "question": "Given a 2*2 grid where each cell contains a number (between 1 to 3), you must select 3 different numbers from these cells. The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column should be less than or equal to 4. The numbers in the same row are separated by ',', and the coordinate system uses the top-left cell as the coordinate (1,1), with the horizontal coordinate under the top-left cell increasing and the vertical coordinate to the right of the top-left cell increasing.\nUsing the number 3 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) as the first selected number\n2, 3\n3, 1\n\nReturn your answer with the format <<<list of selected number positions>>>, where each position is given as row column (0-based indices). For example, <<<0 3, 1 0, 2 4>>> means numbers selected are at positions (0,3), (1,0), and (2,4).",

    "To solve this problem, we need to select three different numbers from the given 2x2 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 3 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) is already selected.\n\nThe grid is as follows:\n\n```\n2, 3\n3, 1\n```\n\nThe coordinates for each cell are:\n- (0,0): 2\n- (0,1): 3\n- (1,0): 3\n- (1,1): 1\n\nWe need to select two more numbers from the remaining cells (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1) such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4.\n\nLet's analyze the possibilities:\n\n1. We have already selected the number 3 at (0,1).\n2. We need to select two more numbers from the remaining cells: (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1).\n\nLet's consider the constraints:\n- Row 0: The sum of selected numbers should be ≤ 4.\n- Row 1: The sum of selected numbers should be ≤ 4.\n- Column 0: The sum of selected numbers should be ≤ 4.\n- Column 1: The sum of selected numbers should be ≤ 4.\n\nNow, let's try to find a combination that satisfies these constraints.\n\nWe can write a small script to check the possible combinations:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Grid representation\ngrid = [\n    [2, 3],\n    [3, 1]\n]\n\n# Pre-selected number at (0,1)\nselected_positions = [(0, 1)]\n\n# Possible positions to select from\npossible_positions = [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1)]\n\n# Check all combinations of two additional selections\nfor combo in combinations(possible_positions, 2):\n    # Combine with the pre-selected position\n    selected = selected_positions + list(combo)\n    \n    # Calculate sums for rows and columns\n    row_sums = [0, 0]\n    col_sums = [0, 0]\n    \n    for r, c in selected:\n        row_sums[r] += grid[r][c]\n        col_sums[c] += grid[r][c]\n    \n    # Check if all sums are <= 4\n    if all(s <= 4 for s in row_sums + col_sums):\n        print(selected)\n        break\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the valid selection of numbers.",
    "The code execution has provided us with a valid selection of numbers from the grid. The selected positions are:\n\n- (0, 1): This is the pre-selected number 3.\n- (1, 0): This is the number 3.\n- (1, 1): This is the number 1.\n\nLet's verify the constraints:\n\n- Row 0: The sum is 3 (only one number selected, which is 3).\n- Row 1: The sum is 3 + 1 = 4.\n- Column 0: The sum is 3.\n- Column 1: The sum is 3 + 1 = 4.\n\nAll sums are less than or equal to 4, satisfying the problem's constraints.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 1, 1 0, 1 1>>>"
