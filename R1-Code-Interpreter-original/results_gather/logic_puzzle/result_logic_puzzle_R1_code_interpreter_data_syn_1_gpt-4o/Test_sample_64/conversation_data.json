  "question": "Given a 5*5 grid where each cell contains a number (between -9 to 10), you must select 10 different numbers from these cells.

    "To solve this problem, we need to select 10 different numbers from the given 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number -6 at position (0,4) is already selected.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial Selection**: We start with the number -6 at position (0,4).\n\n2. **Constraints**: \n   - We need to select 10 numbers in total.\n   - The product of selected numbers in each row and column must be greater than 0.\n   - This implies that each row and column with selected numbers must have an even number of negative numbers or no negative numbers at all.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - We will iterate through the grid and try to select numbers while ensuring the constraints are met.\n   - We will keep track of the number of negative numbers in each row and column to ensure the product condition is satisfied.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - We will use a greedy approach to select numbers, starting from the given number and ensuring that the constraints are met as we proceed.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [-5, 3, 2, 10, -6],\n    [4, 7, 7, 2, 4],\n    [2, -7, -3, 7, 3],\n    [-1, 8, 9, 8, -9],\n    [-6, 2, -3, 9, 10]\n]\n\n# Initialize the selected positions with the given starting point\nselected_positions = [(0, 4)]\n\n# Initialize counters for negative numbers in each row and column\nrow_neg_count = [0] * 5\ncol_neg_count = [0] * 5\n\n# Update the counters for the initial selection\nrow_neg_count[0] += 1\ncol_neg_count[4] += 1\n\n# Function to check if adding a number keeps the product positive\ndef can_add(row, col):\n    # Check if adding this number will keep the product of the row and column positive\n    new_row_neg_count = row_neg_count[row] + (1 if grid[row][col] < 0 else 0)\n    new_col_neg_count = col_neg_count[col] + (1 if grid[row][col] < 0 else 0)\n    return new_row_neg_count % 2 == 0 and new_col_neg_count % 2 == 0\n\n# Try to select numbers\nfor r in range(5):\n    for c in range(5):\n        if len(selected_positions) >= 10:\n            break\n        if (r, c) not in selected_positions and can_add(r, c):\n            selected_positions.append((r, c))\n            if grid[r][c] < 0:\n                row_neg_count[r] += 1\n                col_neg_count[c] += 1\n\n# Print the selected positions\nprint(selected_positions)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to select 10 numbers from the grid while ensuring the product of each row and column of selected numbers is positive. Let's execute this code to find the solution.",
    "The code has successfully selected 10 positions from the grid, ensuring that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. The selected positions are:\n\n- (0, 4): -6\n- (1, 0): 4\n- (1, 1): 7\n- (1, 2): 7\n- (1, 3): 2\n- (2, 0): 2\n- (2, 3): 7\n- (3, 1): 8\n- (3, 2): 9\n- (3, 3): 8\n\nThese selections ensure that each row and column with selected numbers has an even number of negative numbers, thus satisfying the condition that the product is greater than 0.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<0 4, 1 0, 1 1, 1 2, 1 3, 2 0, 2 3, 3 1, 3 2, 3 3>>>"
