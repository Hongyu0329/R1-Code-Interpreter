    "To solve this problem, we need to select 10 different numbers from the given 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Grid Representation**: We have a 5x5 grid with numbers ranging from -10 to 10. We need to select 10 numbers from this grid.\n\n2. **Initial Selection**: We start with the number at position (0,4), which is 2.\n\n3. **Product Condition**: The product of the selected numbers in each row and column must be greater than 0. This implies that for each row and column, the number of negative numbers selected must be even (including zero).\n\n4. **Selection Strategy**: We need to ensure that the selected numbers satisfy the product condition for each row and column. We can start by selecting numbers that are positive or zero, and then adjust by adding pairs of negative numbers if necessary.\n\n5. **Implementation**: We will iterate over the grid, select numbers, and check if the product condition is satisfied. If not, we will adjust our selection.\n\nLet's implement this strategy in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [2, -6, -10, 1, 2],\n    [-3, 2, 7, -3, 6],\n    [3, 7, 4, 9, 1],\n    [-4, 4, 3, 7, 7],\n    [8, 4, 3, 5, 10]\n]\n\n# Initial selection\nselected_positions = [(0, 4)]\n\n# Function to check if the product condition is satisfied\ndef is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n    row_count = [0] * 5\n    col_count = [0] * 5\n    for r, c in selected_positions:\n        if grid[r][c] < 0:\n            row_count[r] += 1\n            col_count[c] += 1\n    # Check if all rows and columns have an even number of negative numbers\n    return all(count % 2 == 0 for count in row_count) and all(count % 2 == 0 for count in col_count)\n\n# Try to select 10 numbers\nfor r in range(5):\n    for c in range(5):\n        if (r, c) != (0, 4) and len(selected_positions) < 10:\n            selected_positions.append((r, c))\n            if not is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n                selected_positions.pop()\n\n# Ensure we have exactly 10 numbers\nwhile len(selected_positions) < 10:\n    for r in range(5):\n        for c in range(5):\n            if (r, c) not in selected_positions:\n                selected_positions.append((r, c))\n                if is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n                    break\n                else:\n                    selected_positions.pop()\n        if len(selected_positions) == 10:\n            break\n\n# Sort the selected positions\nselected_positions.sort()\n\n# Print the selected positions\nprint(selected_positions)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to select 10 numbers from the grid while ensuring that the product condition is satisfied for each row and column. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code has successfully selected 10 positions from the grid that satisfy the condition that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. The selected positions are:\n\n- (0, 0)\n- (0, 3)\n- (0, 4)\n- (1, 1)\n- (1, 2)\n- (1, 4)\n- (2, 0)\n- (2, 1)\n- (2, 2)\n- (2, 3)\n\nThese positions ensure that the product of the selected numbers in each row and column is positive. \n\nNow, let's provide the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<0 0, 0 3, 0 4, 1 1, 1 2, 1 4, 2 0, 2 1, 2 2, 2 3>>>"
