  "question": "Given a 4*4 grid where each cell contains a number (between -4 to 8), you must select 6 different numbers from these cells. The product of each row and column of the selected number must be greater than 0. The numbers in the same row are separated by ',', and the coordinate system uses the top-left cell as the coordinate (1,1), with the horizontal coordinate under the top-left cell increasing and the vertical coordinate to the right of the top-left cell increasing.\nUsing the number 1 in the top-rightmost square (0,3) as the first selected number\n-1, 8, 4, 1\n3, 4, 6, 1\n-4, 1, -1, 4\n-1, 2, 4, -2\n\nReturn your answer with the format <<<list of selected number positions>>>, where each position is given as row column (0-based indices). For example, <<<0 3, 1 0, 2 4>>> means numbers selected are at positions (0,3), (1,0), and (2,4).",

    "To solve this problem, we need to select 6 different numbers from the given 4x4 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number at position (0,3) is already selected.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**: \n   - The grid is:\n     ```\n     -1, 8, 4, 1\n     3, 4, 6, 1\n     -4, 1, -1, 4\n     -1, 2, 4, -2\n     ```\n   - The number at position (0,3) is 1, which is already selected.\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - We need to select 6 numbers in total.\n   - The product of selected numbers in each row and column must be greater than 0.\n   - The product being greater than 0 implies that the product must be positive.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Since the product must be positive, we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers.\n   - We will start by selecting the number at (0,3) and then choose additional numbers while ensuring the product condition is met.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - We will iterate over possible combinations of numbers and check if they satisfy the conditions.\n   - We will use Python to automate the checking process.\n\nLet's write the code to find a valid selection of numbers.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [-1, 8, 4, 1],\n    [3, 4, 6, 1],\n    [-4, 1, -1, 4],\n    [-1, 2, 4, -2]\n]\n\n# Pre-select the number at (0, 3)\nselected_positions = [(0, 3)]\n\n# Function to check if the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive\ndef is_valid_selection(positions):\n    row_products = [1] * 4\n    col_products = [1] * 4\n    \n    for r, c in positions:\n        row_products[r] *= grid[r][c]\n        col_products[c] *= grid[r][c]\n    \n    return all(p > 0 for p in row_products) and all(p > 0 for p in col_products)\n\n# Generate all possible combinations of 5 additional positions\nall_positions = [(r, c) for r in range(4) for c in range(4) if (r, c) != (0, 3)]\nfor additional_positions in combinations(all_positions, 5):\n    current_selection = selected_positions + list(additional_positions)\n    if is_valid_selection(current_selection):\n        print(current_selection)\n        break\n```\n\nThis code will find a valid selection of 6 numbers, including the pre-selected number at (0,3), that satisfies the condition of having a positive product in each row and column. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code has successfully found a valid selection of numbers that satisfy the given conditions. The selected positions are:\n\n- (0, 3): 1\n- (0, 1): 8\n- (0, 2): 4\n- (1, 0): 3\n- (1, 1): 4\n- (1, 2): 6\n\nThese positions ensure that the product of the selected numbers in each row and column is greater than 0.\n\n<<<0 3, 0 1, 0 2, 1 0, 1 1, 1 2>>>"
