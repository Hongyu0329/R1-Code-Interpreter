  "question": "Given a 2*2 grid where each cell contains a number (between 1 to 3), you must select 3 different numbers from these cells. The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column should be less than or equal to 4. The numbers in the same row are separated by ',', and the coordinate system uses the top-left cell as the coordinate (1,1), with the horizontal coordinate under the top-left cell increasing and the vertical coordinate to the right of the top-left cell increasing.\nUsing the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) as the first selected number\n1, 2\n3, 3\n\nReturn your answer with the format <<<list of selected number positions>>>, where each position is given as row column (0-based indices). For example, <<<0 3, 1 0, 2 4>>> means numbers selected are at positions (0,3), (1,0), and (2,4).",

    "To solve this problem, we need to select three different numbers from the given 2x2 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) is already selected.\n\nThe grid is as follows:\n\n```\n1, 2\n3, 3\n```\n\nThe coordinates for each cell are:\n- (0,0): 1\n- (0,1): 2 (already selected)\n- (1,0): 3\n- (1,1): 3\n\nWe need to select two more numbers from the remaining cells (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1) such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4.\n\nLet's analyze the possible selections:\n\n1. If we select the number at (0,0) which is 1:\n   - Row 0 sum: 1 + 2 = 3 (valid)\n   - Column 0 sum: 1 (valid)\n   - We need to select one more number from row 1.\n\n2. If we select the number at (1,0) which is 3:\n   - Row 1 sum: 3 (valid)\n   - Column 0 sum: 1 + 3 = 4 (valid)\n   - We need to select one more number from row 0.\n\n3. If we select the number at (1,1) which is 3:\n   - Row 1 sum: 3 (valid)\n   - Column 1 sum: 2 + 3 = 5 (invalid, exceeds 4)\n\nFrom the above analysis, selecting the number at (1,1) is not valid because it causes the column sum to exceed 4. Therefore, the valid selections are (0,0) and (1,0).\n\nLet's verify this by writing a small script to check the conditions:\n\n```python\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [1, 2],\n    [3, 3]\n]\n\n# Pre-selected number\nselected_positions = [(0, 1)]  # (0,1) is already selected\n\n# Function to check if the selection is valid\ndef is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n    row_sums = [0, 0]\n    col_sums = [0, 0]\n    \n    for r, c in selected_positions:\n        row_sums[r] += grid[r][c]\n        col_sums[c] += grid[r][c]\n    \n    return all(s <= 4 for s in row_sums) and all(s <= 4 for s in col_sums)\n\n# Try selecting two more numbers\nfor r1 in range(2):\n    for c1 in range(2):\n        if (r1, c1) in selected_positions:\n            continue\n        for r2 in range(2):\n            for c2 in range(2):\n                if (r2, c2) in selected_positions or (r2, c2) == (r1, c1):\n                    continue\n                # Check if this selection is valid\n                if is_valid_selection(selected_positions + [(r1, c1), (r2, c2)]):\n                    print(f\"Valid selection: {selected_positions + [(r1, c1), (r2, c2)]}\")\n\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to find the valid selections.",
    "The code output indicates two valid selections, but they are essentially the same set of positions, just listed in a different order. The valid selection is:\n\n- (0, 1): 2 (pre-selected)\n- (0, 0): 1\n- (1, 0): 3\n\nThis selection satisfies the condition that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 1, 0 0, 1 0>>>"
