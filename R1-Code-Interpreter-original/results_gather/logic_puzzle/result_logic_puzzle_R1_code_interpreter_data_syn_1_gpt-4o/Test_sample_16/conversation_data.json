  "question": "Given a 3*3 grid where each cell contains a number (between 1 to 4), you must select 4 different numbers from these cells. The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column should be less than or equal to 4. The numbers in the same row are separated by ',', and the coordinate system uses the top-left cell as the coordinate (1,1), with the horizontal coordinate under the top-left cell increasing and the vertical coordinate to the right of the top-left cell increasing.\nUsing the number 1 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) as the first selected number\n3, 3, 1\n4, 3, 2\n4, 4, 3\n\nReturn your answer with the format <<<list of selected number positions>>>, where each position is given as row column (0-based indices). For example, <<<0 3, 1 0, 2 4>>> means numbers selected are at positions (0,3), (1,0), and (2,4).",

    "To solve this problem, we need to select four different numbers from the given 3x3 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 1 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) is already selected.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Grid Representation**: \n   ```\n   3, 3, 1\n   4, 3, 2\n   4, 4, 3\n   ```\n\n2. **Selected Number**: The number 1 at position (0,2) is already selected.\n\n3. **Constraints**:\n   - We need to select a total of 4 different numbers.\n   - The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column should be less than or equal to 4.\n\n4. **Objective**: Find the positions of the remaining 3 numbers that satisfy the constraints.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the grid and the constraints. We will use a brute-force approach to check all possible combinations of selecting 3 additional numbers from the grid, ensuring that the sum constraints are satisfied.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [3, 3, 1],\n    [4, 3, 2],\n    [4, 4, 3]\n]\n\n# Pre-selected position\nselected_positions = [(0, 2)]\n\n# Function to check if the sum constraints are satisfied\ndef is_valid_selection(positions):\n    row_sums = [0, 0, 0]\n    col_sums = [0, 0, 0]\n    \n    for r, c in positions:\n        row_sums[r] += grid[r][c]\n        col_sums[c] += grid[r][c]\n    \n    return all(s <= 4 for s in row_sums) and all(s <= 4 for s in col_sums)\n\n# Generate all possible combinations of 3 additional positions\nall_positions = [(r, c) for r in range(3) for c in range(3) if (r, c) != (0, 2)]\ncombinations = itertools.combinations(all_positions, 3)\n\n# Check each combination\nfor combo in combinations:\n    positions = selected_positions + list(combo)\n    if is_valid_selection(positions):\n        print(positions)\n        break\n```\n\nThe code will output the positions of the selected numbers that satisfy the constraints. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code has successfully found a valid combination of positions that satisfy the constraints. Let's interpret the output:\n\n- The selected positions are: (0, 2), (0, 0), (1, 1), and (2, 2).\n- These positions correspond to the numbers: 1, 3, 3, and 3, respectively.\n- The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 2, 0 0, 1 1, 2 2>>>"
