  "question": "Given a 6*6 grid where each cell contains a number (between -12 to 12), you must select 12 different numbers from these cells. The product of each row and column of the selected number must be greater than 0.

    "To solve this problem, we need to select 12 different numbers from the given 6x6 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number -12 at position (0,5) is already selected.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial Selection**: We start with the number -12 at position (0,5).\n\n2. **Product Constraint**: For each row and column, the product of the selected numbers must be greater than 0. This means:\n   - The product of selected numbers in each row and column must be positive.\n   - This implies that the number of negative numbers selected in each row and column must be even.\n\n3. **Selection Strategy**:\n   - We need to select 12 numbers in total, including the initial selection.\n   - We need to ensure that the number of negative numbers in each row and column is even.\n   - We should aim to balance the selection of positive and negative numbers to satisfy the product constraint.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - We will iterate over the grid and try to select numbers while keeping track of the number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n   - We will ensure that the total number of selected numbers is 12 and that the product constraint is satisfied.\n\nLet's implement this strategy in Python to find a valid selection of numbers.\n\n```python\ngrid = [\n    [-10, -10, 11, 3, -11, -12],\n    [5, 2, 8, -1, 1, -4],\n    [-12, 11, 11, 10, 8, 10],\n    [7, -8, -9, -5, 12, 2],\n    [9, 12, 5, 7, 11, 2],\n    [-8, 9, -6, 1, 5, -9]\n]\n\n# Initial selection\nselected_positions = [(0, 5)]\nselected_numbers = [-12]\n\n# Function to check if the current selection is valid\ndef is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n    row_count = [0] * 6\n    col_count = [0] * 6\n    row_neg_count = [0] * 6\n    col_neg_count = [0] * 6\n    \n    for r, c in selected_positions:\n        row_count[r] += 1\n        col_count[c] += 1\n        if grid[r][c] < 0:\n            row_neg_count[r] += 1\n            col_neg_count[c] += 1\n    \n    for i in range(6):\n        if row_count[i] > 0 and row_neg_count[i] % 2 != 0:\n            return False\n        if col_count[i] > 0 and col_neg_count[i] % 2 != 0:\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# Try to select 12 numbers\nfor r in range(6):\n    for c in range(6):\n        if (r, c) not in selected_positions:\n            selected_positions.append((r, c))\n            selected_numbers.append(grid[r][c])\n            if len(selected_positions) == 12 and is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n                break\n            if len(selected_positions) > 12 or not is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n                selected_positions.pop()\n                selected_numbers.pop()\n    if len(selected_positions) == 12:\n        break\n\nprint(selected_positions)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to select 12 numbers from the grid while ensuring that the product constraint is satisfied for each row and column.
