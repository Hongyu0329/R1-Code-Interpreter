    "To solve this problem, we need to select 9 different numbers from the given 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number -1 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number.\n\nThe grid is as follows:\n```\n-5, 7, -7, 6, -1\n-2, 2, 8, 6, -3\n3, 4, 4, 3, 8\n-8, -2, 5, 8, 2\n-2, 6, 8, 2, -1\n```\n\nThe constraints imply that for each row and column of the selected numbers, the product must be positive. This means that each row and column must have an even number of negative numbers or no negative numbers at all.\n\nLet's start by selecting the number -1 at position (0,4) and then try to find a combination of 8 other numbers that satisfy the conditions.\n\n### Strategy:\n1. Start with the given number -1 at position (0,4).\n2. Select numbers such that each row and column of the selected numbers has an even number of negative numbers.\n3. Ensure that the total number of selected numbers is 9.\n\n### Approach:\n- We will iterate over possible combinations of numbers and check if they satisfy the conditions.\n- We will use a brute-force approach to try different combinations and check the product conditions.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find a valid combination of numbers.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [-5, 7, -7, 6, -1],\n    [-2, 2, 8, 6, -3],\n    [3, 4, 4, 3, 8],\n    [-8, -2, 5, 8, 2],\n    [-2, 6, 8, 2, -1]\n]\n\n# Pre-select the given number\nselected_positions = [(0, 4)]\n\n# Function to check if a selection is valid\ndef is_valid_selection(positions):\n    row_count = [0] * 5\n    col_count = [0] * 5\n    for r, c in positions:\n        row_count[r] += 1\n        col_count[c] += 1\n    \n    # Check if each row and column has an even number of negative numbers\n    for r in range(5):\n        if row_count[r] % 2 != 0:\n            return False\n    for c in range(5):\n        if col_count[c] % 2 != 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Try to find a valid combination\nall_positions = [(r, c) for r in range(5) for c in range(5) if (r, c) != (0, 4)]\nfor combo in combinations(all_positions, 8):\n    current_selection = selected_positions + list(combo)\n    if is_valid_selection(current_selection):\n        print(current_selection)\n        break\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to find a valid selection of 9 numbers, including the pre-selected number at (0,4), that satisfies the conditions. Let's execute this code to find the solution."
