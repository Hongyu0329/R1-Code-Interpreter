    "To solve this problem, we need to select 6 different numbers from the given 4x4 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 8 in the top-rightmost square (0,3) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**: We have a 4x4 grid with numbers ranging from -4 to 8. The grid is as follows:\n   ```\n   1, 3, -3, 8\n   8, 7, 8, -3\n   2, 2, -4, -1\n   8, 2, 2, 4\n   ```\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - We must select 6 different numbers.\n   - The product of the selected numbers in each row and column must be greater than 0.\n   - The number 8 at position (0,3) is already selected.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Since the product must be greater than 0, we need to ensure that the number of negative numbers in any row or column is even (including zero).\n   - We need to carefully select numbers to satisfy these conditions.\n\n4. **Initial Selection**:\n   - Start with the given number 8 at position (0,3).\n\n5. **Selection Process**:\n   - We will try to select numbers such that the product of each row and column remains positive.\n   - We will use a combination of positive numbers and ensure that any negative numbers are paired to maintain a positive product.\n\nLet's implement a solution to find such a selection:\n\n```python\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [1, 3, -3, 8],\n    [8, 7, 8, -3],\n    [2, 2, -4, -1],\n    [8, 2, 2, 4]\n]\n\n# Start with the given number at position (0,3)\nselected_positions = [(0, 3)]\n\n# Function to check if the current selection is valid\ndef is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n    # Check row and column products\n    row_products = [1] * 4\n    col_products = [1] * 4\n    for r, c in selected_positions:\n        row_products[r] *= grid[r][c]\n        col_products[c] *= grid[r][c]\n    return all(p > 0 for p in row_products) and all(p > 0 for p in col_products)\n\n# Try to select 5 more numbers\nfor r in range(4):\n    for c in range(4):\n        if (r, c) not in selected_positions:\n            selected_positions.append((r, c))\n            if len(selected_positions) == 6 and is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n                print(selected_positions)\n                break\n            if len(selected_positions) < 6:\n                continue\n            selected_positions.pop()\n    if len(selected_positions) == 6:\n        break\n```\n\nThe code will attempt to find a valid selection of 6 numbers, including the given number at (0,3), such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. Let's execute the code to find the solution."
