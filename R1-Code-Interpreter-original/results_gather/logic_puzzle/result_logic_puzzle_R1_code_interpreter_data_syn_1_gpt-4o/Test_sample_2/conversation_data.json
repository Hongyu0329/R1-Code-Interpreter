    "To solve this problem, we need to select three different numbers from the given 2x2 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 1 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) is already selected.\n\nThe grid is as follows:\n```\n3, 1\n2, 3\n```\n\nThe coordinates for the grid are:\n- (0,0) = 3\n- (0,1) = 1 (already selected)\n- (1,0) = 2\n- (1,1) = 3\n\nWe need to select two more numbers from the remaining cells: (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1).\n\nLet's analyze the possible selections:\n1. We have already selected the number 1 at (0,1).\n2. We need to select two more numbers from the remaining cells: (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1).\n\nLet's try selecting numbers and check the sum conditions:\n- If we select (0,0) = 3 and (1,0) = 2, the sums are:\n  - Row 0: 3 + 1 = 4 (valid)\n  - Row 1: 2 (valid)\n  - Column 0: 3 + 2 = 5 (invalid, exceeds 4)\n  - Column 1: 1 (valid)\n\n- If we select (0,0) = 3 and (1,1) = 3, the sums are:\n  - Row 0: 3 + 1 = 4 (valid)\n  - Row 1: 3 (valid)\n  - Column 0: 3 (valid)\n  - Column 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (valid)\n\n- If we select (1,0) = 2 and (1,1) = 3, the sums are:\n  - Row 0: 1 (valid)\n  - Row 1: 2 + 3 = 5 (invalid, exceeds 4)\n  - Column 0: 2 (valid)\n  - Column 1: 1 + 3 = 4 (valid)\n\nThe only valid selection is (0,0) = 3 and (1,1) = 3, along with the already selected (0,1) = 1.\n\nLet's confirm this with a Python script to ensure the conditions are met.\n\n```python\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [3, 1],\n    [2, 3]\n]\n\n# Pre-selected number\nselected_positions = [(0, 1)]  # (0,1) is already selected\n\n# Possible positions to select from\npossible_positions = [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1)]\n\n# Check all combinations of selecting two more numbers\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Function to check if the selection is valid\ndef is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n    # Calculate sums for rows and columns\n    row_sums = [0, 0]\n    col_sums = [0, 0]\n    \n    for r, c in selected_positions:\n        row_sums[r] += grid[r][c]\n        col_sums[c] += grid[r][c]\n    \n    # Check if all sums are <= 4\n    return all(s <= 4 for s in row_sums + col_sums)\n\n# Try all combinations of two more selections\nfor pos1, pos2 in combinations(possible_positions, 2):\n    current_selection = selected_positions + [pos1, pos2]\n    if is_valid_selection(current_selection):\n        # Convert to the required format\n        result = ', '.join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in current_selection)\n        print(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n        break\n```\n\nThe code will check all possible combinations of selecting two more numbers and verify if the sum conditions are met. The valid selection will be printed in the required format.",
    "The code executed successfully and found a valid selection of numbers from the grid that satisfies the given conditions. The selected positions are:\n\n- (0,1) = 1 (pre-selected)\n- (0,0) = 3\n- (1,1) = 3\n\nThese selections ensure that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 1, 0 0, 1 1>>>"
