    "To solve this problem, we need to select 9 different numbers from the given 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number -2 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**: We have a 5x5 grid with numbers ranging from -7 to 8. We need to select 9 numbers such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is positive.\n\n2. **Constraints**: \n   - We must use the number -2 at position (0,4).\n   - The product of numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers must be positive.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Since the product must be positive, we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers.\n   - We need to carefully choose numbers to ensure that the product condition is satisfied.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - Start by selecting the given number -2 at position (0,4).\n   - Choose additional numbers ensuring that the product of numbers in each row and column remains positive.\n\nLet's implement a solution using Python to find a valid selection of numbers.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [2, -2, -5, -7, -2],\n    [7, 2, -7, 8, -1],\n    [4, -5, -6, 5, 6],\n    [7, -6, 2, 8, 4],\n    [-1, 8, 4, -4, 5]\n]\n\n# Initial selected position\nselected_positions = [(0, 4)]\n\n# Function to check if the product of numbers in each row and column is positive\ndef is_valid_selection(positions):\n    row_products = [1] * 5\n    col_products = [1] * 5\n    for r, c in positions:\n        row_products[r] *= grid[r][c]\n        col_products[c] *= grid[r][c]\n    return all(p > 0 for p in row_products) and all(p > 0 for p in col_products)\n\n# Try to find a valid selection of 9 numbers\nfor positions in itertools.combinations([(r, c) for r in range(5) for c in range(5) if (r, c) != (0, 4)], 8):\n    positions = selected_positions + list(positions)\n    if is_valid_selection(positions):\n        print(positions)\n        break\n```\n\nThe code will find a valid selection of 9 numbers, including the given number at position (0,4), such that the product of numbers in each row and column is positive. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code has successfully found a valid selection of 9 numbers from the grid, including the given number at position (0,4), such that the product of numbers in each row and column is positive.
