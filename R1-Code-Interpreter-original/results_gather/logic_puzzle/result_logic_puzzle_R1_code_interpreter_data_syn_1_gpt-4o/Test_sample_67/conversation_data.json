    "To solve this problem, we need to select 10 different numbers from the given 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Grid Representation**: We have a 5x5 grid with numbers ranging from -7 to 10.\n2. **Selection Criteria**: We need to select 10 numbers such that:\n   - The product of selected numbers in each row is greater than 0.\n   - The product of selected numbers in each column is greater than 0.\n3. **Initial Selection**: The number at position (0,4) is already selected.\n\n**Approach**:\n- Start with the given number at (0,4).\n- We need to ensure that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive. This means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n- We will iterate through the grid and select numbers while keeping track of the number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n- We will ensure that the total number of selected numbers is 10.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the positions of the selected numbers.\n\n```python\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [4, 7, -7, 6, 2],\n    [-6, -3, 3, 10, 2],\n    [9, 4, 10, 5, 4],\n    [-4, 4, 8, 5, 7],\n    [8, 1, 10, -2, 10]\n]\n\n# Initialize the selected positions with the given number\nselected_positions = [(0, 4)]\n\n# Function to check if adding a number keeps the product positive\ndef is_valid_selection(selected_positions, new_position):\n    row_count = [0] * 5\n    col_count = [0] * 5\n    for r, c in selected_positions:\n        if grid[r][c] < 0:\n            row_count[r] += 1\n            col_count[c] += 1\n    r, c = new_position\n    if grid[r][c] < 0:\n        row_count[r] += 1\n        col_count[c] += 1\n    # Check if the number of negative numbers in each row and column is even\n    for i in range(5):\n        if row_count[i] % 2 != 0 or col_count[i] % 2 != 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Select numbers\nfor r in range(5):\n    for c in range(5):\n        if (r, c) != (0, 4) and len(selected_positions) < 10:\n            if is_valid_selection(selected_positions, (r, c)):\n                selected_positions.append((r, c))\n\n# Print the selected positions\nprint(selected_positions)\n```\n\nThis code will help us determine the positions of the selected numbers that satisfy the given conditions. Let's execute it to find the solution.",
    "The code has successfully selected 10 positions from the grid, ensuring that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive. Let's verify the selection:\n\n1. **Selected Positions**: \n   - (0, 4), (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3)\n   - (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4)\n   - (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)\n\n2. **Verification**:\n   - **Row 0**: Selected numbers are 2, 4, 7, 6. Product = 2 * 4 * 7 * 6 = 336 (positive).\n   - **Row 1**: Selected numbers are 3, 10, 2. Product = 3 * 10 * 2 = 60 (positive).\n   - **Row 2**: Selected numbers are 9, 4, 10. Product = 9 * 4 * 10 = 360 (positive).\n   - **Columns**:\n     - **Column 0**: Selected numbers are 4, 9. Product = 4 * 9 = 36 (positive).\n     - **Column 1**: Selected numbers are 7, 4. Product = 7 * 4 = 28 (positive).\n     - **Column 2**: Selected numbers are -7, 3, 10. Product = -7 * 3 * 10 = -210 (negative).\n     - **Column 3**: Selected numbers are 6, 10.
