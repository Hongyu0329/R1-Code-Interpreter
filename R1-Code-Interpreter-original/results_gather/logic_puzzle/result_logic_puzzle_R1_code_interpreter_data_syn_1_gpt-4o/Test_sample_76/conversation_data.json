    "To solve this problem, we need to select 10 different numbers from the given 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**: We have a 5x5 grid with numbers ranging from -9 to 10. We need to select 10 numbers, ensuring that the product of numbers in each row and column is positive.\n\n2. **Constraints**: \n   - The product of numbers in each row and column must be greater than 0. This implies that each row and column must have an even number of negative numbers or no negative numbers at all.\n   - We must select exactly 10 numbers, and they must be distinct.\n\n3. **Initial Selection**: We start with the number 2 at position (0,4).\n\n4. **Strategy**:\n   - We need to ensure that the product of numbers in each row and column is positive.\n   - We can start by selecting numbers that are positive or ensure that the number of negative numbers in each row and column is even.\n\n5. **Implementation**:\n   - We will iterate over the grid and select numbers while keeping track of the number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n   - We will ensure that the total number of selected numbers is 10.\n\nLet's implement this strategy using Python code to find a valid selection of numbers.\n\n```python\ngrid = [\n    [-8, 10, -8, -3, 2],\n    [4, 10, 5, 2, 9],\n    [-5, -4, 5, 9, -2],\n    [1, 1, 5, -4, -9],\n    [-9, -5, 1, 10, 3]\n]\n\n# Start with the given number\nselected_positions = [(0, 4)]\nselected_numbers = [2]\n\n# Function to check if the product of numbers in a list is positive\ndef is_product_positive(numbers):\n    negative_count = sum(1 for num in numbers if num < 0)\n    return negative_count % 2 == 0\n\n# Try to select numbers ensuring the product of each row and column is positive\nfor i in range(5):\n    for j in range(5):\n        if len(selected_positions) == 10:\n            break\n        if (i, j) not in selected_positions:\n            # Check if adding this number keeps the product positive\n            row_numbers = [grid[i][col] for col in range(5) if (i, col) in selected_positions or col == j]\n            col_numbers = [grid[row][j] for row in range(5) if (row, j) in selected_positions or row == i]\n            if is_product_positive(row_numbers) and is_product_positive(col_numbers):\n                selected_positions.append((i, j))\n                selected_numbers.append(grid[i][j])\n\n# Output the selected positions\nprint(', '.join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in selected_positions))\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to select 10 numbers from the grid while ensuring that the product of numbers in each row and column is positive.

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Given a 5*5 grid where each cell contains a number (between -9 to 10), you must select 10 different numbers from these cells. The product of each row and column of the selected number must be greater than 0. The numbers in the same row are separated by ',', and the coordinate system uses the top-left cell as the coordinate (1,1), with the horizontal coordinate under the top-left cell increasing and the vertical coordinate to the right of the top-left cell increasing.\nUsing the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) as the first selected number\n-8, 10, -8, -3, 2\n4, 10, 5, 2, 9\n-5, -4, 5, 9, -2\n1, 1, 5, -4, -9\n-9, -5, 1, 10, 3\n\nReturn your answer with the format <<<list of selected number positions>>>, where each position is given as row column (0-based indices). For example, <<<0 3, 1 0, 2 4>>> means numbers selected are at positions (0,3), (1,0), and (2,4).",
