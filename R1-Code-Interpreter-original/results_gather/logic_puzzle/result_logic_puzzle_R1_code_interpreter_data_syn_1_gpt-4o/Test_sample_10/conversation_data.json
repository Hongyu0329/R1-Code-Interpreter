    "To solve this problem, we need to select three different numbers from the given 2x2 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) is already selected.\n\nThe grid is as follows:\n```\n1, 2\n3, 1\n```\n\nThe coordinates for the grid are:\n- (0,0) = 1\n- (0,1) = 2\n- (1,0) = 3\n- (1,1) = 1\n\nWe need to select two more numbers from the grid, ensuring that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and column is less than or equal to 4.\n\nLet's analyze the possible selections:\n\n1. We have already selected the number 2 at position (0,1).\n2. We need to select two more numbers from the remaining positions: (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1).\n\nLet's consider the constraints:\n- Row 0: The sum of selected numbers should be ≤ 4.\n- Row 1: The sum of selected numbers should be ≤ 4.\n- Column 0: The sum of selected numbers should be ≤ 4.\n- Column 1: The sum of selected numbers should be ≤ 4.\n\nNow, let's try to find a valid combination by selecting two more numbers:\n\n- If we select the number at (0,0) which is 1, the sum for Row 0 becomes 1 + 2 = 3, which is valid.\n- If we select the number at (1,0) which is 3, the sum for Column 0 becomes 1 + 3 = 4, which is valid.\n- The sum for Row 1 becomes 3, which is valid.\n- The sum for Column 1 becomes 2, which is valid.\n\nThus, selecting numbers at positions (0,1), (0,0), and (1,0) satisfies all the constraints.\n\nLet's verify this using a Python script to ensure the solution is correct.\n\n```python\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [1, 2],\n    [3, 1]\n]\n\n# Pre-selected number position\nselected_positions = [(0, 1)]\n\n# Function to check if the selection is valid\ndef is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n    row_sums = [0, 0]\n    col_sums = [0, 0]\n    \n    for r, c in selected_positions:\n        row_sums[r] += grid[r][c]\n        col_sums[c] += grid[r][c]\n    \n    return all(s <= 4 for s in row_sums) and all(s <= 4 for s in col_sums)\n\n# Try selecting two more numbers\nfor r1 in range(2):\n    for c1 in range(2):\n        if (r1, c1) not in selected_positions:\n            for r2 in range(2):\n                for c2 in range(2):\n                    if (r2, c2) not in selected_positions and (r2, c2) != (r1, c1):\n                        new_selection = selected_positions + [(r1, c1), (r2, c2)]\n                        if is_valid_selection(new_selection):\n                            print(new_selection)\n                            break\n```\n\nThe code will output the valid selection of positions. Let's execute it to confirm our solution.",
    "The code output provides multiple valid selections of positions that satisfy the constraints. Let's analyze the results:\n\n1. [(0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 0)]\n2. [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, 0)]\n3. [(0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]\n4. [(0, 1), (1, 1), (0, 0)]\n5. [(0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 0)]\n\nAll these selections are valid as they satisfy the condition that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and column is less than or equal to 4. \n\nSince the problem requires us to return the positions of the selected numbers, we can choose any of these valid selections. Let's choose the first one for simplicity.\n\n<<<0 1, 0 0, 1 0>>>"
