  "question": "Given a 3*3 grid where each cell contains a number (between 1 to 4), you must select 4 different numbers from these cells. The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column should be less than or equal to 4. The numbers in the same row are separated by ',', and the coordinate system uses the top-left cell as the coordinate (1,1), with the horizontal coordinate under the top-left cell increasing and the vertical coordinate to the right of the top-left cell increasing.\nUsing the number 1 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) as the first selected number\n4, 4, 1\n3, 2, 1\n2, 2, 4\n\nReturn your answer with the format <<<list of selected number positions>>>, where each position is given as row column (0-based indices). For example, <<<0 3, 1 0, 2 4>>> means numbers selected are at positions (0,3), (1,0), and (2,4).",

    "To solve this problem, we need to select 4 different numbers from the given 3x3 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 1 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) is already selected.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Grid Representation**: \n   ```\n   4, 4, 1\n   3, 2, 1\n   2, 2, 4\n   ```\n\n2. **Selected Number**: \n   - The number 1 at position (0,2) is already selected.\n\n3. **Constraints**:\n   - We need to select 3 more numbers such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4.\n   - The selected numbers must be different.\n\n4. **Approach**:\n   - Start with the given selected number (1 at position (0,2)).\n   - Try to select numbers from the grid that satisfy the constraints.\n   - Ensure that the sum of selected numbers in each row and column is â‰¤ 4.\n\nLet's implement a solution using Python to find the positions of the selected numbers.\n\n```python\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [4, 4, 1],\n    [3, 2, 1],\n    [2, 2, 4]\n]\n\n# Start with the given selected number\nselected_positions = [(0, 2)]\nselected_numbers = [grid[0][2]]\n\n# Function to check if adding a number at a position is valid\ndef is_valid_selection(r, c, selected_positions, selected_numbers):\n    # Check if the number is already selected\n    if grid[r][c] in selected_numbers:\n        return False\n    \n    # Calculate the sum for the row and column\n    row_sum = sum(grid[r][j] for i, j in selected_positions if i == r) + grid[r][c]\n    col_sum = sum(grid[i][c] for i, j in selected_positions if j == c) + grid[r][c]\n    \n    # Check if the sum is less than or equal to 4\n    return row_sum <= 4 and col_sum <= 4\n\n# Try to select 3 more numbers\nfor r in range(3):\n    for c in range(3):\n        if (r, c) not in selected_positions and is_valid_selection(r, c, selected_positions, selected_numbers):\n            selected_positions.append((r, c))\n            selected_numbers.append(grid[r][c])\n            if len(selected_positions) == 4:\n                break\n    if len(selected_positions) == 4:\n        break\n\n# Print the selected positions\nprint(selected_positions)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to find the positions of the selected numbers that satisfy the given constraints. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and returned the positions of the selected numbers. Based on the output, the selected positions are:\n\n- (0, 2): The number 1, which was pre-selected.\n- (1, 0): The number 3.\n- (2, 1): The number 2.\n\nThese selections ensure that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4, and all selected numbers are different.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 2, 1 0, 2 1>>>"
