  "question": "Given a 3*3 grid where each cell contains a number (between 1 to 4), you must select 4 different numbers from these cells. The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column should be less than or equal to 4. The numbers in the same row are separated by ',', and the coordinate system uses the top-left cell as the coordinate (1,1), with the horizontal coordinate under the top-left cell increasing and the vertical coordinate to the right of the top-left cell increasing.\nUsing the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) as the first selected number\n1, 1, 2\n3, 4, 3\n4, 4, 3\n\nReturn your answer with the format <<<list of selected number positions>>>, where each position is given as row column (0-based indices). For example, <<<0 3, 1 0, 2 4>>> means numbers selected are at positions (0,3), (1,0), and (2,4).",

    "To solve this problem, we need to select 4 different numbers from the given 3x3 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) is already selected.\n\nHere's the grid for reference:\n\n```\n1, 1, 2\n3, 4, 3\n4, 4, 3\n```\n\nThe selected number 2 is at position (0,2). We need to select 3 more numbers from the grid, ensuring that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and column does not exceed 4.\n\nLet's analyze the grid:\n\n- Row 0: [1, 1, 2]\n- Row 1: [3, 4, 3]\n- Row 2: [4, 4, 3]\n\n- Column 0: [1, 3, 4]\n- Column 1: [1, 4, 4]\n- Column 2: [2, 3, 3]\n\nSince we have already selected the number 2 at position (0,2), the sum for row 0 is currently 2, and the sum for column 2 is also 2. We need to select numbers such that the sum in each row and column remains ≤ 4.\n\nLet's try to find a combination of numbers that satisfies these conditions. We will use a brute-force approach to check possible combinations.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [1, 1, 2],\n    [3, 4, 3],\n    [4, 4, 3]\n]\n\n# Pre-selected number position\npre_selected = (0, 2)\n\n# All possible positions except the pre-selected one\npositions = [(i, j) for i in range(3) for j in range(3) if (i, j) != pre_selected]\n\n# Function to check if a selection is valid\ndef is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n    row_sums = [0, 0, 0]\n    col_sums = [0, 0, 0]\n    \n    # Include the pre-selected number\n    row_sums[pre_selected[0]] += grid[pre_selected[0]][pre_selected[1]]\n    col_sums[pre_selected[1]] += grid[pre_selected[0]][pre_selected[1]]\n    \n    # Calculate sums for the selected positions\n    for pos in selected_positions:\n        row_sums[pos[0]] += grid[pos[0]][pos[1]]\n        col_sums[pos[1]] += grid[pos[0]][pos[1]]\n    \n    # Check if all sums are <= 4\n    return all(s <= 4 for s in row_sums) and all(s <= 4 for s in col_sums)\n\n# Try all combinations of 3 positions\nfor selected_positions in combinations(positions, 3):\n    if is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n        # Include the pre-selected position in the result\n        result = [pre_selected] + list(selected_positions)\n        # Format the result as required\n        formatted_result = ', '.join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in result)\n        print(f\"<<<{formatted_result}>>>\")\n        break\n```\n\nThis code will check all combinations of 3 positions from the grid (excluding the pre-selected position) and determine if they satisfy the condition of having row and column sums ≤ 4. Once a valid combination is found, it will print the result in the required format.",
    "The code has successfully found a valid combination of positions that satisfy the given conditions. Let's break down the result:\n\n- The pre-selected number is at position (0, 2) with the value 2.\n- The additional selected positions are:\n  - (0, 0) with the value 1\n  - (0, 1) with the value 1\n  - (1, 0) with the value 3\n\nLet's verify the sums:\n\n- Row 0: 1 (at 0,0) + 1 (at 0,1) + 2 (at 0,2) = 4\n- Row 1: 3 (at 1,0) = 3\n- Row 2: No numbers selected, sum = 0\n\n- Column 0: 1 (at 0,0) + 3 (at 1,0) = 4\n- Column 1: 1 (at 0,1) = 1\n- Column 2: 2 (at 0,2) = 2\n\nAll row and column sums are ≤ 4, which satisfies the problem's conditions.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 2, 0 0, 0 1, 1 0>>>"
