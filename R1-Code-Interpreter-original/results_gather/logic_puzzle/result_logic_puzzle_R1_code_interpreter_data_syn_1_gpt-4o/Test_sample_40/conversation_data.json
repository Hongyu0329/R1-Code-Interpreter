    "To solve this problem, we need to select 6 different numbers from the given 4x4 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number at position (0,3) is -1 and must be included in our selection.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Grid Representation**: The grid is represented as follows:\n   ```\n   -4, 5, 7, -1\n   2, -4, -2, -5\n   6, 6, -4, 4\n   -1, 2, 1, -1\n   ```\n\n2. **Initial Selection**: We start with the number at position (0,3), which is -1.\n\n3. **Constraints**: We need to select 5 more numbers such that:\n   - The product of selected numbers in each row is greater than 0.\n   - The product of selected numbers in each column is greater than 0.\n\n4. **Strategy**:\n   - We need to ensure that the product of numbers in each row and column is positive. This means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n   - We will try to select numbers such that the constraints are satisfied.\n\n5. **Implementation**:\n   - We will iterate over possible combinations of numbers and check if they satisfy the constraints.\n   - We will use Python to automate the checking process.\n\nLet's implement the solution in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [-4, 5, 7, -1],\n    [2, -4, -2, -5],\n    [6, 6, -4, 4],\n    [-1, 2, 1, -1]\n]\n\n# Predefined selection\ninitial_selection = [(0, 3)]\n\n# Function to calculate product of selected numbers in a row or column\ndef product_of_selected(selected, indices, is_row=True):\n    product = 1\n    for idx in indices:\n        if is_row:\n            product *= grid[idx][selected[idx]]\n        else:\n            product *= grid[selected[idx]][idx]\n    return product\n\n# Check if a selection is valid\ndef is_valid_selection(selection):\n    # Check rows\n    for i in range(4):\n        row_indices = [j for j in range(4) if (i, j) in selection]\n        if len(row_indices) > 0 and product_of_selected(row_indices, row_indices) <= 0:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check columns\n    for j in range(4):\n        col_indices = [i for i in range(4) if (i, j) in selection]\n        if len(col_indices) > 0 and product_of_selected(col_indices, col_indices, is_row=False) <= 0:\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# Generate all possible selections of 5 more numbers\nall_positions = [(i, j) for i in range(4) for j in range(4) if (i, j) != (0, 3)]\nfor additional_selection in combinations(all_positions, 5):\n    selection = initial_selection + list(additional_selection)\n    if is_valid_selection(selection):\n        print(selection)\n        break\n```\n\nThis code will find a valid selection of 6 numbers, including the initial number at (0,3), that satisfies the constraints. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The error indicates that there is an issue with the indexing in the `product_of_selected` function.
