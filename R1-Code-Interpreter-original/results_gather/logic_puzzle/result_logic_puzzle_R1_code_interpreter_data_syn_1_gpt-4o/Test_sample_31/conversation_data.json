  "question": "Given a 3*3 grid where each cell contains a number (between 1 to 4), you must select 4 different numbers from these cells. The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column should be less than or equal to 4. The numbers in the same row are separated by ',', and the coordinate system uses the top-left cell as the coordinate (1,1), with the horizontal coordinate under the top-left cell increasing and the vertical coordinate to the right of the top-left cell increasing.\nUsing the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) as the first selected number\n2, 1, 2\n3, 1, 3\n4, 2, 2\n\nReturn your answer with the format <<<list of selected number positions>>>, where each position is given as row column (0-based indices). For example, <<<0 3, 1 0, 2 4>>> means numbers selected are at positions (0,3), (1,0), and (2,4).",

    "To solve this problem, we need to select 4 different numbers from the given 3x3 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) is already selected.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have a 3x3 grid:\n   ```\n   2, 1, 2\n   3, 1, 3\n   4, 2, 2\n   ```\n\n2. The first selected number is at position (0,2) with a value of 2.\n\n3. We need to select 3 more numbers such that:\n   - The sum of selected numbers in each row is ≤ 4.\n   - The sum of selected numbers in each column is ≤ 4.\n   - All selected numbers are different.\n\n4. We need to ensure that the selected numbers are different, which means we cannot select the same number twice.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the grid and the constraints:\n\n- The grid has numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4.\n- We have already selected the number 2 at position (0,2).\n- We need to select numbers such that the sum in each row and column is ≤ 4.\n\nNow, let's try to find a combination of positions that satisfy these conditions. We can use a brute-force approach to try different combinations and check if they meet the criteria.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [2, 1, 2],\n    [3, 1, 3],\n    [4, 2, 2]\n]\n\n# The first selected number is at position (0, 2)\nselected_positions = [(0, 2)]\nselected_numbers = {grid[0][2]}\n\n# Function to check if the selection is valid\ndef is_valid_selection(positions):\n    row_sums = [0] * 3\n    col_sums = [0] * 3\n    numbers = set()\n    \n    for r, c in positions:\n        number = grid[r][c]\n        if number in numbers:\n            return False\n        numbers.add(number)\n        row_sums[r] += number\n        col_sums[c] += number\n    \n    return all(s <= 4 for s in row_sums) and all(s <= 4 for s in col_sums)\n\n# Try all combinations of 3 additional positions\nfor additional_positions in itertools.combinations([(r, c) for r in range(3) for c in range(3) if (r, c) != (0, 2)], 3):\n    positions = selected_positions + list(additional_positions)\n    if is_valid_selection(positions):\n        print(positions)\n        break\n```\n\nThe code will find a valid combination of positions that satisfy the constraints. Let's execute it to see the result."
