  "question": "Given a 6*6 grid where each cell contains a number (between -11 to 12), you must select 12 different numbers from these cells. The product of each row and column of the selected number must be greater than 0.

    "To solve this problem, we need to select 12 different numbers from the given 6x6 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number at position (0,5) is already selected.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial Selection**: We start with the number at position (0,5), which is 1. This number is positive, so it doesn't affect the product negatively.\n\n2. **Product Constraint**: For the product of numbers in each row and column to be greater than 0, we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column, or all numbers should be positive.\n\n3. **Selection Strategy**: \n   - We need to carefully select numbers such that each row and column with selected numbers has an even number of negative numbers.\n   - We should aim to select numbers that are positive or, if necessary, balance the negatives.\n\n4. **Implementation**: We will use a brute-force approach to try different combinations of numbers and check if they satisfy the conditions.\n\nLet's write a Python script to implement this logic and find a valid selection of numbers.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# The given grid\ngrid = [\n    [5, 1, 10, 11, 1, 1],\n    [7, 9, -1, 12, -9, 8],\n    [3, 10, 1, -1, -11, 1],\n    [3, -10, -4, -9, 3, 6],\n    [3, -2, 3, -10, 2, 3],\n    [-9, -3, 8, 4, 6, 6]\n]\n\n# Initial selected position\ninitial_position = (0, 5)\n\n# Function to check if a selection is valid\ndef is_valid_selection(selection):\n    # Check row and column products\n    row_neg_count = [0] * 6\n    col_neg_count = [0] * 6\n    \n    for r, c in selection:\n        if grid[r][c] < 0:\n            row_neg_count[r] += 1\n            col_neg_count[c] += 1\n    \n    # Check if all rows and columns have even negative counts\n    for count in row_neg_count + col_neg_count:\n        if count % 2 != 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Generate all possible selections of 12 numbers including the initial position\nall_positions = [(r, c) for r in range(6) for c in range(6)]\nall_positions.remove(initial_position)\n\n# Try all combinations\nfor selection in itertools.combinations(all_positions, 11):\n    full_selection = [initial_position] + list(selection)\n    if is_valid_selection(full_selection):\n        # Convert to the required format\n        result = ', '.join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in full_selection)\n        print(result)\n        break\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to find a valid selection of 12 numbers from the grid, starting with the number at position (0,5). It checks each combination to ensure that the product of numbers in each row and column is positive. Once a valid selection is found, it prints the positions in the required format.",
    "The code has successfully found a valid selection of numbers from the grid that satisfies the given conditions. The output provides the positions of the selected numbers in the required format.\n\nThe selected positions are:\n- Row 0: (0,5), (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4)\n- Row 1: (1,0), (1,1), (1,3), (1,5)\n- Row 2: (2,0), (2,1)\n\nThis selection ensures that the product of numbers in each row and column is greater than 0, as required.\n\n<<<0 5, 0 0, 0 1, 0 2, 0 3, 0 4, 1 0, 1 1, 1 3, 1 5, 2 0, 2 1>>>"
