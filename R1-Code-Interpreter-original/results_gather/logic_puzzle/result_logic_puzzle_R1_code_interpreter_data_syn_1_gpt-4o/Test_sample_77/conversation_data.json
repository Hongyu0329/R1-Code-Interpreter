    "To solve this problem, we need to select 10 different numbers from the given 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 5 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Constraints**:\n   - We need to select 10 numbers.\n   - The product of numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers must be greater than 0.\n   - The number at position (0,4) is already selected.\n\n2. **Grid Analysis**:\n   - The grid is:\n     ```\n     10, 8, 3, -9, 5\n     -2, 5, 7, 10, 2\n     9, 6, 4, -4, 9\n     4, 4, -6, 4, 1\n     8, -9, -9, 10, 4\n     ```\n   - We need to ensure that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Start with the given number at (0,4).\n   - Select numbers such that each row and column has an even number of negative numbers or no negative numbers at all.\n   - Ensure that the total number of selected numbers is 10.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - We will use a brute-force approach to try different combinations and check the conditions.\n   - We will write a Python script to automate this process.\n\nLet's implement the solution using Python code:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [10, 8, 3, -9, 5],\n    [-2, 5, 7, 10, 2],\n    [9, 6, 4, -4, 9],\n    [4, 4, -6, 4, 1],\n    [8, -9, -9, 10, 4]\n]\n\n# Pre-select the given number\nselected_positions = [(0, 4)]\n\n# Function to check if the product of numbers in each row and column is positive\ndef is_valid_selection(positions):\n    row_products = [1] * 5\n    col_products = [1] * 5\n    for r, c in positions:\n        row_products[r] *= grid[r][c]\n        col_products[c] *= grid[r][c]\n    return all(p > 0 for p in row_products) and all(p > 0 for p in col_products)\n\n# Generate all possible combinations of 9 additional positions\nall_positions = [(r, c) for r in range(5) for c in range(5) if (r, c) != (0, 4)]\nfor additional_positions in itertools.combinations(all_positions, 9):\n    current_selection = selected_positions + list(additional_positions)\n    if is_valid_selection(current_selection):\n        print(current_selection)\n        break\n```\n\nThis code will find a valid selection of 10 numbers, including the pre-selected number at (0,4), such that the product of numbers in each row and column is positive. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
