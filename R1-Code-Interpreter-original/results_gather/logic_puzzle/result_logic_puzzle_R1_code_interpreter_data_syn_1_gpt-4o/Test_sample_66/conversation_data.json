  "question": "Given a 5*5 grid where each cell contains a number (between -10 to 9), you must select 10 different numbers from these cells. The product of each row and column of the selected number must be greater than 0. The numbers in the same row are separated by ',', and the coordinate system uses the top-left cell as the coordinate (1,1), with the horizontal coordinate under the top-left cell increasing and the vertical coordinate to the right of the top-left cell increasing.\nUsing the number 8 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) as the first selected number\n6, -8, -3, 9, 8\n4, 8, 9, 3, -8\n9, 4, 5, 2, 1\n-4, -2, -4, 2, 7\n1, -3, 9, 1, -10\n\nReturn your answer with the format <<<list of selected number positions>>>, where each position is given as row column (0-based indices).

    "To solve this problem, we need to select 10 different numbers from the given 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 8 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is already selected.\n\nHere's the grid for reference:\n\n```\n6, -8, -3, 9, 8\n4, 8, 9, 3, -8\n9, 4, 5, 2, 1\n-4, -2, -4, 2, 7\n1, -3, 9, 1, -10\n```\n\n### Reasoning Process\n\n1. **Initial Selection**: We start with the number 8 at position (0,4).\n\n2. **Constraints**: \n   - We need to select 10 numbers in total.\n   - The product of selected numbers in each row and column must be greater than 0.\n   - This implies that each row and column with selected numbers must have an even number of negative numbers or no negative numbers at all.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - We will try to select numbers such that the product of each row and column remains positive.\n   - We will ensure that the number of negative numbers in each row and column is even.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - We will iterate over the grid and select numbers while keeping track of the number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n   - We will ensure that the total number of selected numbers is 10.\n\nLet's implement this strategy using Python code to find a valid selection of numbers.\n\n```python\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [6, -8, -3, 9, 8],\n    [4, 8, 9, 3, -8],\n    [9, 4, 5, 2, 1],\n    [-4, -2, -4, 2, 7],\n    [1, -3, 9, 1, -10]\n]\n\n# Initialize the selected positions with the given number\nselected_positions = [(0, 4)]\n\n# Function to check if the product of selected numbers in a row or column is positive\ndef is_product_positive(selected_positions, grid):\n    row_count = [0] * 5\n    col_count = [0] * 5\n    for r, c in selected_positions:\n        if grid[r][c] < 0:\n            row_count[r] += 1\n            col_count[c] += 1\n    # Check if all rows and columns have an even number of negative numbers\n    return all(count % 2 == 0 for count in row_count) and all(count % 2 == 0 for count in col_count)\n\n# Try to select 9 more numbers\nfor r in range(5):\n    for c in range(5):\n        if (r, c) not in selected_positions:\n            selected_positions.append((r, c))\n            if len(selected_positions) == 10 and is_product_positive(selected_positions, grid):\n                break\n            if len(selected_positions) > 10 or not is_product_positive(selected_positions, grid):\n                selected_positions.pop()\n    if len(selected_positions) == 10:\n        break\n\n# Print the selected positions\nprint(selected_positions)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to find a valid selection of 10 numbers from the grid, ensuring that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code successfully selected 10 positions from the grid, ensuring that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive.
