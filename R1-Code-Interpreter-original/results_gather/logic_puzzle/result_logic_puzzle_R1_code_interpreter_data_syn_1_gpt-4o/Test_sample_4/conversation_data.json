    "To solve this problem, we need to select three different numbers from the given 2x2 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) is already selected.\n\nThe grid is as follows:\n```\n3, 2\n1, 2\n```\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have already selected the number 2 at position (0,1).\n2. We need to select two more numbers from the remaining cells: (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1).\n3. The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column should be less than or equal to 4.\n\nLet's evaluate the possible selections:\n\n- If we select the number at (0,0) which is 3, the sum of the first row becomes 3 + 2 = 5, which exceeds 4. So, we cannot select (0,0).\n- If we select the number at (1,0) which is 1, the sum of the second row becomes 1 + 2 = 3, which is valid.\n- If we select the number at (1,1) which is 2, the sum of the second row becomes 2 + 2 = 4, which is valid.\n\nNow, let's check the column sums:\n\n- For column 0, if we select (1,0), the sum becomes 3 + 1 = 4, which is valid.\n- For column 1, we already have 2 at (0,1), and if we select (1,1), the sum becomes 2 + 2 = 4, which is valid.\n\nThus, the valid selections are:\n- (0,1) with value 2\n- (1,0) with value 1\n- (1,1) with value 2\n\nThese selections satisfy the condition that the sum in each row and column is less than or equal to 4.\n\nLet's format the answer as required:\n\n<<<0 1, 1 0, 1 1>>>"
