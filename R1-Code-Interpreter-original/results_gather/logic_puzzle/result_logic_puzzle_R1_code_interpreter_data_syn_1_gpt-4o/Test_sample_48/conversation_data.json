    "To solve this problem, we need to select 9 different numbers from the given 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 5 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number.\n\nThe constraints imply that the product of numbers in each row and column must be positive, which means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers. Since we are selecting 9 numbers, we can have either 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 negative numbers in total.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the grid and selecting numbers that satisfy these conditions:\n\n```\nGrid:\n-7,  1,  1,  6,  5\n 7,  1,  3,  8,  8\n 7, -1, -2, -5,  1\n 7, -1,  6, -7,  2\n 3, -3,  5, -8,  7\n```\n\n1. We start with the number 5 at position (0,4).\n2. We need to select 8 more numbers such that the product of each row and column is positive.\n\nLet's try to select numbers manually and check if they satisfy the conditions:\n\n- Select (0,4) = 5\n- Select (0,3) = 6\n- Select (0,1) = 1\n- Select (1,0) = 7\n- Select (1,2) = 3\n- Select (2,0) = 7\n- Select (2,4) = 1\n- Select (3,2) = 6\n- Select (4,4) = 7\n\nNow, let's check the product of each row and column:\n\n- Row 0: 5, 6, 1 -> Product = 30 (positive)\n- Row 1: 7, 3 -> Product = 21 (positive)\n- Row 2: 7, 1 -> Product = 7 (positive)\n- Row 3: 6 -> Product = 6 (positive)\n- Row 4: 7 -> Product = 7 (positive)\n\n- Column 0: 7, 7 -> Product = 49 (positive)\n- Column 1: 1 -> Product = 1 (positive)\n- Column 2: 3, 6 -> Product = 18 (positive)\n- Column 3: 6 -> Product = 6 (positive)\n- Column 4: 5, 1, 7 -> Product = 35 (positive)\n\nAll products are positive, so this selection satisfies the conditions.\n\nLet's format the selected positions:\n\n- (0,4), (0,3), (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,4), (3,2), (4,4)\n\nNow, let's return the final answer:\n\n<<<0 4, 0 3, 0 1, 1 0, 1 2, 2 0, 2 4, 3 2, 4 4>>>"
