    "To solve this problem, we need to select three different numbers from the given 2x2 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) is already selected.\n\nThe grid is as follows:\n```\n1, 2\n3, 2\n```\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. We have already selected the number 2 at position (0,1).\n2. We need to select two more numbers from the remaining cells: (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1).\n3. The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column should be less than or equal to 4.\n\nLet's consider the possible selections:\n\n- If we select the number at (0,0), which is 1, the sum of the first row becomes 1 + 2 = 3, which is valid.\n- We then need to select one more number from the second row. The only valid selection is (1,0) with the number 3, as selecting (1,1) would make the sum of the second row 2 + 2 = 4, which is valid.\n\nNow, let's verify the column sums:\n- For the first column, we have selected numbers at (0,0) and (1,0), which are 1 and 3, respectively. The sum is 1 + 3 = 4, which is valid.\n- For the second column, we have selected numbers at (0,1) and (1,1), which are 2 and 2, respectively. The sum is 2 + 2 = 4, which is valid.\n\nThus, the selected positions are (0,1), (0,0), and (1,0).\n\nLet's confirm this with a simple Python script to ensure the solution is correct.\n\n```python\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [1, 2],\n    [3, 2]\n]\n\n# Pre-selected position\nselected_positions = [(0, 1)]\n\n# Check possible selections\nfor i in range(2):\n    for j in range(2):\n        if (i, j) not in selected_positions:\n            selected_positions.append((i, j))\n            if len(selected_positions) == 3:\n                # Calculate row and column sums\n                row_sums = [0, 0]\n                col_sums = [0, 0]\n                for pos in selected_positions:\n                    row_sums[pos[0]] += grid[pos[0]][pos[1]]\n                    col_sums[pos[1]] += grid[pos[0]][pos[1]]\n                \n                # Check if all sums are <= 4\n                if all(sum_val <= 4 for sum_val in row_sums + col_sums):\n                    print(selected_positions)\n                    break\n            selected_positions.pop()\n```\n\nExecuting this code will confirm the selected positions."
