  "question": "Given a 3*3 grid where each cell contains a number (between 1 to 4), you must select 4 different numbers from these cells. The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column should be less than or equal to 4. The numbers in the same row are separated by ',', and the coordinate system uses the top-left cell as the coordinate (1,1), with the horizontal coordinate under the top-left cell increasing and the vertical coordinate to the right of the top-left cell increasing.\nUsing the number 4 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) as the first selected number\n1, 3, 4\n3, 3, 3\n2, 2, 2\n\nReturn your answer with the format <<<list of selected number positions>>>, where each position is given as row column (0-based indices). For example, <<<0 3, 1 0, 2 4>>> means numbers selected are at positions (0,3), (1,0), and (2,4).",

    "To solve this problem, we need to select 4 different numbers from the given 3x3 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 4 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) is already selected.\n\nThe grid is as follows:\n```\n1, 3, 4\n3, 3, 3\n2, 2, 2\n```\n\nThe selected number 4 is at position (0,2). We need to select 3 more numbers from the grid, ensuring that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and column is less than or equal to 4.\n\nLet's analyze the grid:\n- Row 0: [1, 3, 4]\n- Row 1: [3, 3, 3]\n- Row 2: [2, 2, 2]\n\nSince we have already selected 4 from (0,2), the sum of the selected numbers in row 0 is already 4, so we cannot select any more numbers from row 0.\n\nNow, let's consider the remaining rows and columns:\n- Row 1: We can select one number that is less than or equal to 1 to keep the sum ≤ 4.\n- Row 2: We can select one number that is less than or equal to 2 to keep the sum ≤ 4.\n\nFor the columns:\n- Column 0: We can select one number that is less than or equal to 2 to keep the sum ≤ 4.\n- Column 1: We can select one number that is less than or equal to 1 to keep the sum ≤ 4.\n- Column 2: Already has 4, so no more selections.\n\nLet's try to find a combination that satisfies these conditions.

    "\nThe User asks a question, and you solve it. \nYou first generate the reasoning and thinking process and then provide the User with the final answer.\nDuring the thinking process, **you can generate python code** for efficient searching, optimization, and computing with the format of starting the python block with ```python. \n**A code query must involve only a single script that uses 'print' function for the output.**. \nOnce the code script is complete, stop the generation. Then, the code interpreter platform will execute the code and return the execution output and error.\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response.\nOtherwise, you can continue your reasoning process and possibly generate more code query to solve the problem.\n\n    Given a 3*3 grid where each cell contains a number (between 1 to 4), you must select 4 different numbers from these cells. The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column should be less than or equal to 4. The numbers in the same row are separated by ',', and the coordinate system uses the top-left cell as the coordinate (1,1), with the horizontal coordinate under the top-left cell increasing and the vertical coordinate to the right of the top-left cell increasing.\nUsing the number 4 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) as the first selected number\n1, 3, 4\n3, 3, 3\n2, 2, 2\n\nReturn your answer with the format <<<list of selected number positions>>>, where each position is given as row column (0-based indices). For example, <<<0 3, 1 0, 2 4>>> means numbers selected are at positions (0,3), (1,0), and (2,4).",
