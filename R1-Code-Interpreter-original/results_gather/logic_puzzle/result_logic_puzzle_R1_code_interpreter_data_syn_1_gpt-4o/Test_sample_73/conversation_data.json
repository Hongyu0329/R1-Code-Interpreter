  "question": "Given a 5*5 grid where each cell contains a number (between -9 to 10), you must select 10 different numbers from these cells. The product of each row and column of the selected number must be greater than 0.

    "To solve this problem, we need to select 10 different numbers from the 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number -6 at position (0,4) is already selected.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial Selection**: We start with the number -6 at position (0,4).\n\n2. **Constraints**: \n   - We need to select 9 more numbers.\n   - The product of selected numbers in each row and column must be greater than 0. This implies that the product must be positive, which means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - We will iterate through the grid and try to select numbers such that the conditions are satisfied.\n   - We need to ensure that the number of negative numbers in each row and column is even.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - We will use a brute-force approach to try different combinations of numbers and check if they satisfy the conditions.\n   - We will use Python to implement this logic and find a valid selection of numbers.\n\nLet's implement the code to find a valid selection of numbers:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# The grid\ngrid = [\n    [-8, 2, -9, 9, -6],\n    [4, 2, -2, 7, 7],\n    [-7, 6, 8, -4, -5],\n    [10, -1, -7, 4, 1],\n    [-8, -9, 3, 7, 10]\n]\n\n# Initial selection\nselected_positions = [(0, 4)]\n\n# Function to check if the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive\ndef is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n    row_count = [0] * 5\n    col_count = [0] * 5\n    for r, c in selected_positions:\n        if grid[r][c] < 0:\n            row_count[r] += 1\n            col_count[c] += 1\n    # Check if each row and column has an even number of negative numbers\n    for count in row_count + col_count:\n        if count % 2 != 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Try to find a valid selection\nfor positions in itertools.combinations([(r, c) for r in range(5) for c in range(5) if (r, c) != (0, 4)], 9):\n    selected_positions = [(0, 4)] + list(positions)\n    if is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n        break\n\n# Output the selected positions\nprint(', '.join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in selected_positions))\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to find a valid selection of 10 numbers from the grid, starting with the number -6 at position (0,4), and ensuring that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive. Let's execute this code to find the solution.",
    "The code has successfully found a valid selection of numbers from the grid. The selected positions are:\n\n- (0, 4): -6\n- (0, 0): -8\n- (0, 1): 2\n- (0, 3): 9\n- (1, 0): 4\n- (1, 1): 2\n- (1, 3): 7\n- (1, 4): 7\n- (2, 0): -7\n- (2, 4): -5\n\nThese positions ensure that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive. \n\nThe final answer is:\n\n<<<0 4, 0 0, 0 1, 0 3, 1 0, 1 1, 1 3, 1 4, 2 0, 2 4>>>"
