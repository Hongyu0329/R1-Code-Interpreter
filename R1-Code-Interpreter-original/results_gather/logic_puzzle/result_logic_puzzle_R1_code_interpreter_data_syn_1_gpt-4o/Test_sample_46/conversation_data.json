    "To solve this problem, we need to select 6 different numbers from the given 4x4 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number at position (0,3) is already selected.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**: \n   - The grid is:\n     ```\n     -1,  4, -3,  1\n     -1,  3,  3, -4\n      6,  8, -2,  7\n     -2,  5,  7, -3\n     ```\n   - We need to select 6 numbers, and one of them is already selected at position (0,3) with the value 1.\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - The product of selected numbers in each row and column must be greater than 0.\n   - This implies that the product must be positive, which can be achieved by having an even number of negative numbers or all positive numbers in each row and column.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Start with the selected number at (0,3).\n   - Choose additional numbers ensuring that the product of numbers in each row and column remains positive.\n   - We need to carefully select numbers to maintain the balance of positive and negative numbers.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - We will use a brute-force approach to try different combinations and check the conditions.\n   - We will write a Python script to automate this process and find a valid combination.\n\nLet's implement the code to find a valid selection of numbers.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [-1,  4, -3,  1],\n    [-1,  3,  3, -4],\n    [ 6,  8, -2,  7],\n    [-2,  5,  7, -3]\n]\n\n# Pre-select the number at (0,3)\nselected_positions = [(0, 3)]\n\n# Function to calculate product of selected numbers in a row or column\ndef product_of_selected(selected, indices, is_row=True):\n    product = 1\n    for idx in indices:\n        if is_row:\n            product *= grid[selected[idx][0]][selected[idx][1]]\n        else:\n            product *= grid[selected[idx][1]][selected[idx][0]]\n    return product\n\n# Check if the selection is valid\ndef is_valid_selection(selected):\n    # Check each row\n    for row in range(4):\n        row_indices = [i for i, (r, c) in enumerate(selected) if r == row]\n        if len(row_indices) > 0 and product_of_selected(selected, row_indices) <= 0:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check each column\n    for col in range(4):\n        col_indices = [i for i, (r, c) in enumerate(selected) if c == col]\n        if len(col_indices) > 0 and product_of_selected(selected, col_indices, is_row=False) <= 0:\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# Try all combinations of 5 additional numbers\nall_positions = [(r, c) for r in range(4) for c in range(4) if (r, c) != (0, 3)]\nfor additional_positions in combinations(all_positions, 5):\n    selected = selected_positions + list(additional_positions)\n    if is_valid_selection(selected):\n        # Convert to the required format\n        result = ', '.join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in selected)\n        print(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\n        break\n```\n\nThis code will try different combinations of numbers and check if they satisfy the conditions. Once a valid combination is found, it will print the result in the required format.",
    "The code executed successfully and found a valid selection of numbers that satisfy the given conditions. The selected positions are:\n\n- (0, 3): 1\n- (0, 0): -1\n- (0, 2): -3\n- (2, 0): 6\n- (3, 0): -2\n- (3, 3): -3\n\nThese selections ensure that the product of numbers in each row and column is greater than 0.
