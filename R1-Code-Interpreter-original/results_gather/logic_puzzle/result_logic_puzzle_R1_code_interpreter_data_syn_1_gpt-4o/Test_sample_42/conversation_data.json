    "To solve this problem, we need to select 6 different numbers from the given 4x4 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number at position (0,3) is already selected.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Grid Analysis**: We have a 4x4 grid with numbers ranging from -5 to 8. The grid is as follows:\n   ```\n   8, 4, 5, 1\n   1, -4, -1, 4\n   -5, -3, 7, 6\n   4, 1, 7, 5\n   ```\n\n2. **Initial Selection**: The number at position (0,3) is 1, which is already selected.\n\n3. **Objective**: We need to select 5 more numbers such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0.\n\n4. **Constraints**:\n   - The product of numbers in each row and column must be positive.\n   - We need to select exactly 6 numbers.\n\n5. **Strategy**:\n   - Start with the given number at (0,3).\n   - Select numbers ensuring that the product of numbers in each row and column remains positive.\n   - Consider the sign of numbers and their positions to ensure the product is positive.\n\nLet's implement a solution using Python to find the positions of the selected numbers.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [8, 4, 5, 1],\n    [1, -4, -1, 4],\n    [-5, -3, 7, 6],\n    [4, 1, 7, 5]\n]\n\n# Initial selected position\nselected_positions = [(0, 3)]\n\n# Function to check if the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive\ndef is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n    # Check rows\n    for i in range(4):\n        row_product = 1\n        for j in range(4):\n            if (i, j) in selected_positions:\n                row_product *= grid[i][j]\n        if row_product <= 0:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check columns\n    for j in range(4):\n        col_product = 1\n        for i in range(4):\n            if (i, j) in selected_positions:\n                col_product *= grid[i][j]\n        if col_product <= 0:\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# Try to find a valid selection\nfor positions in itertools.combinations([(i, j) for i in range(4) for j in range(4) if (i, j) != (0, 3)], 5):\n    current_selection = selected_positions + list(positions)\n    if is_valid_selection(current_selection):\n        print(current_selection)\n        break\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to find a valid selection of 6 numbers, including the given number at (0,3), such that the product of numbers in each row and column is positive. Let's execute the code to find the solution.",
    "The code has successfully found a valid selection of numbers from the grid that satisfies the condition of having a positive product for each row and column. The selected positions are:\n\n- (0, 3): 1\n- (0, 0): 8\n- (0, 1): 4\n- (0, 2): 5\n- (1, 0): 1\n- (1, 3): 4\n\nThese positions ensure that the product of numbers in each row and column is greater than 0.\n\n<<<0 3, 0 0, 0 1, 0 2, 1 0, 1 3>>>"
