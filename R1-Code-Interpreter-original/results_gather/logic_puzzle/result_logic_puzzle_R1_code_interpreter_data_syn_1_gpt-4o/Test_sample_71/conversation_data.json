  "question": "Given a 5*5 grid where each cell contains a number (between -9 to 10), you must select 10 different numbers from these cells. The product of each row and column of the selected number must be greater than 0.

    "To solve this problem, we need to select 10 different numbers from the given 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 7 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Grid Representation**: We have a 5x5 grid with numbers ranging from -9 to 10. We need to select 10 numbers from this grid.\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - The product of selected numbers in each row and column must be greater than 0.\n   - We must use the number 7 at position (0,4).\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - We need to ensure that the product of numbers in each row and column is positive. This means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n   - We will start by selecting the number 7 at position (0,4) and then carefully choose other numbers to satisfy the constraints.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - We will iterate over the grid and try to select numbers such that the constraints are satisfied.\n   - We will use a backtracking approach to explore possible selections and check if they meet the criteria.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find a valid selection of numbers.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [-8, 5, -9, 6, 7],\n    [10, -7, 3, 9, 9],\n    [-2, 7, -5, 10, 1],\n    [4, 9, 6, -5, 1],\n    [7, 9, 3, 7, 5]\n]\n\n# Initial selected position\nselected_positions = [(0, 4)]\n\n# Function to check if the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive\ndef is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n    row_products = [1] * 5\n    col_products = [1] * 5\n    for r, c in selected_positions:\n        row_products[r] *= grid[r][c]\n        col_products[c] *= grid[r][c]\n    return all(p > 0 for p in row_products) and all(p > 0 for p in col_products)\n\n# Try to find a valid selection of 10 numbers\ndef find_selection():\n    # Generate all possible positions in the grid\n    all_positions = [(r, c) for r in range(5) for c in range(5)]\n    # Remove the initial selected position\n    all_positions.remove((0, 4))\n    \n    # Try all combinations of 9 additional positions\n    for additional_positions in itertools.combinations(all_positions, 9):\n        current_selection = selected_positions + list(additional_positions)\n        if is_valid_selection(current_selection):\n            return current_selection\n    return None\n\n# Find a valid selection\nvalid_selection = find_selection()\n\n# Format the output\nif valid_selection:\n    result = ', '.join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in valid_selection)\n    print(f\"<<<{result}>>>\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No valid selection found.\")\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to find a valid selection of 10 numbers from the grid that satisfies the given constraints. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code has successfully found a valid selection of 10 numbers from the grid that satisfies the constraints. The output is a list of positions in the format specified, indicating the selected numbers' positions in the grid.\n\nThe selected positions are:\n- (0, 4): 7\n- (0, 0): -8\n- (0, 1): 5\n- (0, 2): -9\n- (0, 3): 6\n- (1, 0): 10\n- (1, 2): 3\n- (1, 3): 9\n- (2, 0): -2\n- (2, 2): -5\n\nThese positions ensure that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is greater than 0, satisfying the problem's constraints.\n\n<<<0 4, 0 0, 0 1, 0 2, 0 3, 1 0, 1 2, 1 3, 2 0, 2 2>>>"
