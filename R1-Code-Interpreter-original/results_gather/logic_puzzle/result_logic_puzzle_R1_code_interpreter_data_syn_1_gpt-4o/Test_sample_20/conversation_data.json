  "question": "Given a 3*3 grid where each cell contains a number (between 1 to 4), you must select 4 different numbers from these cells. The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column should be less than or equal to 4. The numbers in the same row are separated by ',', and the coordinate system uses the top-left cell as the coordinate (1,1), with the horizontal coordinate under the top-left cell increasing and the vertical coordinate to the right of the top-left cell increasing.\nUsing the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) as the first selected number\n3, 1, 2\n2, 4, 4\n3, 2, 1\n\nReturn your answer with the format <<<list of selected number positions>>>, where each position is given as row column (0-based indices). For example, <<<0 3, 1 0, 2 4>>> means numbers selected are at positions (0,3), (1,0), and (2,4).",

    "To solve this problem, we need to select four different numbers from the given 3x3 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 2 in the top-rightmost square (0,2) is already selected.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Grid Representation**: \n   ```\n   3, 1, 2\n   2, 4, 4\n   3, 2, 1\n   ```\n\n2. **Selected Number**: \n   - The number 2 at position (0,2) is already selected.\n\n3. **Constraints**:\n   - We need to select 3 more numbers such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4.\n   - The selected numbers must be different.\n\n4. **Approach**:\n   - Start with the selected number at (0,2).\n   - Try to select numbers from the grid while ensuring the constraints are met.\n   - Use a brute-force approach to try different combinations and check if they satisfy the conditions.\n\nLet's implement this logic in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [3, 1, 2],\n    [2, 4, 4],\n    [3, 2, 1]\n]\n\n# Pre-selected number\nselected_positions = [(0, 2)]\nselected_numbers = [grid[0][2]]\n\n# All possible positions except the pre-selected one\nall_positions = [(i, j) for i in range(3) for j in range(3) if (i, j) != (0, 2)]\n\n# Function to check if the selection is valid\ndef is_valid_selection(positions):\n    # Check if all numbers are different\n    numbers = [grid[i][j] for i, j in positions]\n    if len(set(numbers)) != len(numbers):\n        return False\n    \n    # Check row and column sums\n    row_sums = [0] * 3\n    col_sums = [0] * 3\n    for i, j in positions:\n        row_sums[i] += grid[i][j]\n        col_sums[j] += grid[i][j]\n    \n    if any(s > 4 for s in row_sums) or any(s > 4 for s in col_sums):\n        return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# Try all combinations of 3 positions from the remaining positions\nfor combination in itertools.combinations(all_positions, 3):\n    # Add the pre-selected position\n    current_selection = selected_positions + list(combination)\n    if is_valid_selection(current_selection):\n        # If valid, print the positions\n        print(current_selection)\n        break\n```\n\nThis code will find a valid selection of positions that satisfy the given constraints. Let's execute it to see the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and found a valid selection of positions that satisfy the constraints. The selected positions are:\n\n- (0, 2): The pre-selected number 2.\n- (1, 1): The number 4.\n- (2, 0): The number 3.\n- (2, 2): The number 1.\n\nThese positions ensure that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4, and all selected numbers are different.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 2, 1 1, 2 0, 2 2>>>"
