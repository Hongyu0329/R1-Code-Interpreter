    "To solve this problem, we need to select 10 different numbers from the given 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 5 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Grid Representation**: We have a 5x5 grid with numbers ranging from -9 to 9. We need to select 10 numbers from this grid.\n\n2. **Constraints**:\n   - The product of the selected numbers in each row and column must be greater than 0.\n   - We must select exactly 10 numbers.\n   - The number at position (0,4) is already selected.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - We need to ensure that the product of numbers in each row and column is positive. This means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n   - We can start by selecting the number at (0,4) and then carefully choose other numbers to satisfy the constraints.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - We will iterate over possible combinations of numbers and check if they satisfy the constraints.\n   - We will use Python to automate the checking process.\n\nLet's implement the solution using Python:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [9, 7, 4, 5, 5],\n    [-7, 4, -3, -4, 5],\n    [7, 1, 3, 2, 8],\n    [4, 9, 2, 1, 6],\n    [-4, 6, -9, 7, 3]\n]\n\n# Pre-select the number at (0,4)\nselected_positions = [(0, 4)]\n\n# Function to calculate the product of selected numbers in a row or column\ndef product_of_selected(selected, indices, is_row=True):\n    product = 1\n    for idx in indices:\n        if is_row:\n            product *= grid[selected[idx][0]][selected[idx][1]]\n        else:\n            product *= grid[selected[idx][1]][selected[idx][0]]\n    return product\n\n# Check if the selected positions satisfy the constraints\ndef is_valid_selection(selected):\n    # Check each row\n    for row in range(5):\n        row_indices = [i for i, (r, c) in enumerate(selected) if r == row]\n        if len(row_indices) > 0 and product_of_selected(selected, row_indices) <= 0:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check each column\n    for col in range(5):\n        col_indices = [i for i, (r, c) in enumerate(selected) if c == col]\n        if len(col_indices) > 0 and product_of_selected(selected, col_indices, is_row=False) <= 0:\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# Try to find a valid selection\nfor comb in combinations([(r, c) for r in range(5) for c in range(5) if (r, c) != (0, 4)], 9):\n    selected = selected_positions + list(comb)\n    if is_valid_selection(selected):\n        print(selected)\n        break\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to find a valid selection of 10 numbers, including the pre-selected number at (0,4), that satisfies the constraints. The output will be the positions of the selected numbers.",
    "The code has successfully found a valid selection of 10 numbers from the grid that satisfies the constraints. The selected positions are:\n\n- (0, 4)\n- (0, 0)\n- (0, 1)\n- (0, 2)\n- (0, 3)\n- (1, 0)\n- (1, 1)\n- (1, 2)\n- (2, 1)\n- (2, 4)\n\nThese positions ensure that the product of the selected numbers in each row and column is greater than 0.\n\n<<<0 4, 0 0, 0 1, 0 2, 0 3, 1 0, 1 1, 1 2, 2 1, 2 4>>>"
