    "To solve this problem, we need to select 12 different numbers from the given 6x6 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 1 in the top-rightmost square (0,5) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial Selection**: We start with the number at position (0,5), which is 1.\n\n2. **Constraints**: \n   - We need to select 12 numbers in total.\n   - The product of selected numbers in each row and column must be greater than 0. This implies that each row and column must have an even number of negative numbers or no negative numbers at all.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - We will iterate through the grid and select numbers while keeping track of the number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n   - We will ensure that the product condition is satisfied as we select numbers.\n\n4. **Implementation**:\n   - We will use a greedy approach to select numbers, starting from the given number and ensuring the product condition is met.\n   - We will keep track of selected positions and ensure no position is selected more than once.\n\nLet's implement this strategy in Python to find the solution.\n\n```python\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [1, -5, -7, 1, -2, 1],\n    [-9, 3, -4, -3, 9, 6],\n    [2, 12, -1, -9, 5, 11],\n    [10, 11, 11, 10, 2, 12],\n    [2, 9, 4, 6, 3, 7],\n    [1, -5, 5, 6, 1, 1]\n]\n\n# Initialize the selected positions with the given starting point\nselected_positions = [(0, 5)]\n\n# Function to check if the current selection is valid\ndef is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n    row_neg_count = [0] * 6\n    col_neg_count = [0] * 6\n    \n    for r, c in selected_positions:\n        if grid[r][c] < 0:\n            row_neg_count[r] += 1\n            col_neg_count[c] += 1\n    \n    for count in row_neg_count + col_neg_count:\n        if count % 2 != 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Try to select 12 numbers\nfor r in range(6):\n    for c in range(6):\n        if (r, c) not in selected_positions:\n            selected_positions.append((r, c))\n            if len(selected_positions) == 12 and is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n                break\n            if len(selected_positions) > 12 or not is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n                selected_positions.pop()\n    if len(selected_positions) == 12:\n        break\n\n# Print the selected positions\nprint(selected_positions)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to select 12 numbers from the grid while ensuring the product condition is met for each row and column. Let's execute this code to find the solution.",
    "The code executed successfully and provided a list of selected positions that satisfy the given conditions. The selected positions are:\n\n- (0, 5)\n- (0, 0)\n- (0, 3)\n- (1, 1)\n- (1, 4)\n- (1, 5)\n- (2, 0)\n- (2, 1)\n- (2, 4)\n- (2, 5)\n- (3, 0)\n- (3, 1)\n\nThese positions ensure that the product of the selected numbers in each row and column is greater than 0, and the total number of selected numbers is 12.\n\n<<<0 5, 0 0, 0 3, 1 1, 1 4, 1 5, 2 0, 2 1, 2 4, 2 5, 3 0, 3 1>>>"
