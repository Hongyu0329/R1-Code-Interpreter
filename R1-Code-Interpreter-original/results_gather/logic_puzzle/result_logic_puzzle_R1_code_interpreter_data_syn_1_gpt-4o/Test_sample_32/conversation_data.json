    "To solve this problem, we need to select 6 different numbers from the given 4x4 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 4 in the top-rightmost square (0,3) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Grid Representation**: We have a 4x4 grid with the following numbers:\n   ```\n   -4, 8, 4, 4\n   4, -5, 4, -2\n   -1, 6, 2, 8\n   5, -3, 6, 3\n   ```\n\n2. **Initial Selection**: The number at position (0,3) is already selected, which is 4.\n\n3. **Selection Criteria**: We need to select 5 more numbers such that:\n   - The product of selected numbers in each row is greater than 0.\n   - The product of selected numbers in each column is greater than 0.\n\n4. **Strategy**:\n   - We need to ensure that the product of numbers in each row and column is positive. This means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n   - We will start by selecting numbers that are positive or zero to simplify the process.\n\n5. **Implementation**:\n   - We will iterate over the grid and try to select numbers that satisfy the conditions.\n   - We will use a brute-force approach to try different combinations and check if they meet the criteria.\n\nLet's implement this in Python to find a valid selection of numbers.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [-4, 8, 4, 4],\n    [4, -5, 4, -2],\n    [-1, 6, 2, 8],\n    [5, -3, 6, 3]\n]\n\n# Initial selected position\ninitial_position = (0, 3)\n\n# Function to check if the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive\ndef is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n    # Initialize row and column products\n    row_products = [1] * 4\n    col_products = [1] * 4\n    \n    # Calculate the product for each row and column\n    for r, c in selected_positions:\n        row_products[r] *= grid[r][c]\n        col_products[c] *= grid[r][c]\n    \n    # Check if all products are positive\n    return all(p > 0 for p in row_products) and all(p > 0 for p in col_products)\n\n# Generate all possible combinations of 5 additional positions\nall_positions = [(r, c) for r in range(4) for c in range(4) if (r, c) != initial_position]\ncombinations = itertools.combinations(all_positions, 5)\n\n# Find a valid combination\nfor combo in combinations:\n    selected_positions = [initial_position] + list(combo)\n    if is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n        # Format the output as required\n        result = ', '.join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in selected_positions)\n        print(result)\n        break\n```\n\nThis code will find a valid selection of 6 numbers from the grid that satisfies the given conditions. Let's execute it to get the result.",
    "The code executed successfully and found a valid selection of numbers from the grid. The selected positions are:\n\n- (0, 3)\n- (0, 1)\n- (0, 2)\n- (1, 0)\n- (1, 2)\n- (2, 1)\n\nThese positions ensure that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is greater than 0.\n\n<<<0 3, 0 1, 0 2, 1 0, 1 2, 2 1>>>"
