  "question": "Given a 2*2 grid where each cell contains a number (between 1 to 3), you must select 3 different numbers from these cells. The sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column should be less than or equal to 4. The numbers in the same row are separated by ',', and the coordinate system uses the top-left cell as the coordinate (1,1), with the horizontal coordinate under the top-left cell increasing and the vertical coordinate to the right of the top-left cell increasing.\nUsing the number 1 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) as the first selected number\n3, 1\n3, 2\n\nReturn your answer with the format <<<list of selected number positions>>>, where each position is given as row column (0-based indices). For example, <<<0 3, 1 0, 2 4>>> means numbers selected are at positions (0,3), (1,0), and (2,4).",

    "To solve this problem, we need to select three different numbers from the given 2x2 grid such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4. We are given that the number 1 in the top-rightmost square (0,1) is already selected.\n\nThe grid is as follows:\n```\n3, 1\n3, 2\n```\n\nThe coordinates for the grid are:\n- (0,0) = 3\n- (0,1) = 1 (already selected)\n- (1,0) = 3\n- (1,1) = 2\n\nWe need to select two more numbers from the remaining three numbers (3, 3, 2) such that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4.\n\nLet's analyze the possible selections:\n\n1. If we select the number at (0,0) which is 3:\n   - Row 0 sum: 3 + 1 = 4 (valid)\n   - Column 0 sum: 3 (valid)\n   - We need to select one more number from the second row.\n\n2. If we select the number at (1,1) which is 2:\n   - Row 1 sum: 2 (valid)\n   - Column 1 sum: 1 + 2 = 3 (valid)\n\nThus, selecting numbers at (0,0) and (1,1) satisfies all conditions.\n\nLet's verify this with a small Python script to ensure the conditions are met.\n\n```python\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [3, 1],\n    [3, 2]\n]\n\n# Selected positions\nselected_positions = [(0, 1), (0, 0), (1, 1)]\n\n# Calculate sums for rows and columns\nrow_sums = [0, 0]\ncol_sums = [0, 0]\n\nfor r, c in selected_positions:\n    row_sums[r] += grid[r][c]\n    col_sums[c] += grid[r][c]\n\n# Check if all sums are <= 4\nvalid = all(s <= 4 for s in row_sums + col_sums)\n\nprint(selected_positions if valid else \"No valid selection\")\n```\n\nNow, let's execute the code to verify the solution.",
    "The code executed successfully, and the output indicates that the selected positions are valid. The selected numbers are at positions (0,1), (0,0), and (1,1), which satisfy the condition that the sum of the selected numbers in each row and each column is less than or equal to 4.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n<<<0 1, 0 0, 1 1>>>"
