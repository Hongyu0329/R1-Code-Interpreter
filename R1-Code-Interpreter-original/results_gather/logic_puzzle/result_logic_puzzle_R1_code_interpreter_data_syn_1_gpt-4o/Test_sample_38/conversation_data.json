    "To solve this problem, we need to select 6 different numbers from the given 4x4 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number at position (0,3) is already selected, which is -1.\n\nThe grid is as follows:\n```\n3, -4, 3, -1\n8, -4, -2, 1\n7, 4, -4, 2\n5, 4, 5, 3\n```\n\nThe selected numbers must satisfy the condition that the product of numbers in each row and column is greater than 0. This means that for each row and column containing selected numbers, the product must be positive. Since we have a negative number (-1) already selected, we need to ensure that the product of the selected numbers in each row and column is positive, which implies an even number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n\nLet's start by selecting numbers and checking the conditions:\n\n1. We have already selected (0,3) which is -1.\n2. We need to select 5 more numbers.\n\nTo ensure the product is positive, we can select numbers such that:\n- Each row and column with selected numbers has an even number of negative numbers.\n\nLet's write a Python script to help us find a valid selection of numbers.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [3, -4, 3, -1],\n    [8, -4, -2, 1],\n    [7, 4, -4, 2],\n    [5, 4, 5, 3]\n]\n\n# Pre-select the given number\nselected_positions = [(0, 3)]\n\n# Function to check if the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive\ndef is_valid_selection(selected_positions):\n    row_count = [0] * 4\n    col_count = [0] * 4\n    row_neg_count = [0] * 4\n    col_neg_count = [0] * 4\n    \n    for r, c in selected_positions:\n        row_count[r] += 1\n        col_count[c] += 1\n        if grid[r][c] < 0:\n            row_neg_count[r] += 1\n            col_neg_count[c] += 1\n    \n    for i in range(4):\n        if row_count[i] > 0 and row_neg_count[i] % 2 != 0:\n            return False\n        if col_count[i] > 0 and col_neg_count[i] % 2 != 0:\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# Try all combinations of 5 more positions\nall_positions = [(r, c) for r in range(4) for c in range(4) if (r, c) != (0, 3)]\nfor combination in itertools.combinations(all_positions, 5):\n    selected = selected_positions + list(combination)\n    if is_valid_selection(selected):\n        print(selected)\n        break\n```\n\nThis script will try all combinations of 5 additional positions and check if the selection satisfies the condition of having a positive product in each row and column. Let's execute the code to find a valid selection."
