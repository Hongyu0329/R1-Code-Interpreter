    "To solve this problem, we need to select 10 different numbers from the given 5x5 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 1 in the top-rightmost square (0,4) is the first selected number.\n\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Initial Selection**: We start with the number 1 at position (0,4).\n\n2. **Product Constraint**: For each row and column, the product of the selected numbers must be greater than 0. This means:\n   - The product must be positive.\n   - We need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column, or all numbers must be positive.\n\n3. **Selection Strategy**:\n   - We need to select 10 numbers in total.\n   - We need to ensure that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive.\n   - We need to carefully choose numbers to satisfy the constraints.\n\n4. **Grid Analysis**:\n   - We have 5 rows and 5 columns, and we need to select 10 numbers.\n   - We need to ensure that each row and column has at least one selected number.\n\n5. **Implementation**:\n   - We will start by selecting the given number and then try to select numbers in a way that satisfies the constraints.\n\nLet's implement a strategy to select the numbers:\n\n```python\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [-4, -1, -2, 5, 1],\n    [4, -7, 6, 5, -3],\n    [-6, 10, 9, 3, 10],\n    [3, -9, -8, 3, 7],\n    [5, 5, 6, 8, -3]\n]\n\n# Start with the given number\nselected_positions = [(0, 4)]\n\n# Function to check if the product of selected numbers in a row or column is positive\ndef is_product_positive(selected_positions, grid):\n    # Check rows\n    for i in range(5):\n        product = 1\n        for j in range(5):\n            if (i, j) in selected_positions:\n                product *= grid[i][j]\n        if product <= 0:\n            return False\n    \n    # Check columns\n    for j in range(5):\n        product = 1\n        for i in range(5):\n            if (i, j) in selected_positions:\n                product *= grid[i][j]\n        if product <= 0:\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# Try to select numbers to satisfy the constraints\ndef select_numbers(grid, selected_positions):\n    # We need to select 10 numbers in total\n    while len(selected_positions) < 10:\n        for i in range(5):\n            for j in range(5):\n                if (i, j) not in selected_positions:\n                    selected_positions.append((i, j))\n                    if is_product_positive(selected_positions, grid):\n                        if len(selected_positions) == 10:\n                            return selected_positions\n                    else:\n                        selected_positions.pop()\n    return selected_positions\n\n# Get the selected positions\nselected_positions = select_numbers(grid, selected_positions)\n\n# Print the selected positions\nprint(selected_positions)\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to select 10 numbers from the grid while ensuring that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive. Let's execute the code to see the result.",
    "The code has successfully selected 10 positions from the grid that satisfy the condition that the product of selected numbers in each row and column is positive. Let's format the output as requested:\n\nThe selected positions are:\n- (0, 4): 1\n- (0, 3): 5\n- (1, 0): 4\n- (1, 2): 6\n- (1, 3): 5\n- (2, 1): 10\n- (2, 2): 9\n- (2, 3): 3\n- (2, 4): 10\n- (3, 0): 3\n\nThese selections ensure that the product of numbers in each row and column is positive.\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer in the required format:\n\n<<<0 4, 0 3, 1 0, 1 2, 1 3, 2 1, 2 2, 2 3, 2 4, 3 0>>>"
