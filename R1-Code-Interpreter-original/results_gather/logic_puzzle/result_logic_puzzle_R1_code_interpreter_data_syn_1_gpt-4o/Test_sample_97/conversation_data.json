    "To solve this problem, we need to select 16 different numbers from the given 7x7 grid such that the product of each row and column of the selected numbers is greater than 0. We are given that the number 7 in the top-rightmost square (0,6) is the first selected number.\n\nThe key points to consider are:\n1. We need to select 16 numbers, including the given number at (0,6).\n2. The product of numbers in each row and column of the selected numbers must be positive, which means we need an even number of negative numbers in each row and column.\n3. We need to ensure that the selected numbers are spread across the grid to meet the row and column product conditions.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the grid and selecting numbers that satisfy these conditions. We will use a combination of positive and negative numbers to ensure the product condition is met.\n\nHere's the grid for reference:\n```\n10, -10, -5, -13, -7, 5, 7\n13, 14, 3, 3, 3, -9, 6\n2, -10, -9, 5, -3, 12, -13\n-3, 14, 12, 9, 11, 6, 5\n10, 1, 13, 9, 8, 6, 3\n8, 2, -4, 8, 12, 8, 4\n13, 1, 14, -2, 1, -13, 1\n```\n\nWe will start by selecting the number at (0,6) and then choose additional numbers to satisfy the conditions. We will use a systematic approach to ensure that the product conditions are met.\n\nLet's write a Python script to help us select the numbers and check the conditions:\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\n# Define the grid\ngrid = [\n    [10, -10, -5, -13, -7, 5, 7],\n    [13, 14, 3, 3, 3, -9, 6],\n    [2, -10, -9, 5, -3, 12, -13],\n    [-3, 14, 12, 9, 11, 6, 5],\n    [10, 1, 13, 9, 8, 6, 3],\n    [8, 2, -4, 8, 12, 8, 4],\n    [13, 1, 14, -2, 1, -13, 1]\n]\n\n# Initial selected position\nselected_positions = [(0, 6)]\n\n# Function to check if the product of numbers in a list is positive\ndef is_product_positive(numbers):\n    product = 1\n    for num in numbers:\n        product *= num\n    return product > 0\n\n# Function to check if the current selection satisfies the conditions\ndef check_selection(selected_positions):\n    # Check row products\n    for row in range(7):\n        row_numbers = [grid[row][col] for col in range(7) if (row, col) in selected_positions]\n        if len(row_numbers) > 0 and not is_product_positive(row_numbers):\n            return False\n    \n    # Check column products\n    for col in range(7):\n        col_numbers = [grid[row][col] for row in range(7) if (row, col) in selected_positions]\n        if len(col_numbers) > 0 and not is_product_positive(col_numbers):\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# Try to select 16 numbers\ndef select_numbers():\n    # Start with the initial position\n    positions = [(r, c) for r in range(7) for c in range(7)]\n    positions.remove((0, 6))\n    \n    # Try all combinations of 15 additional positions\n    for additional_positions in itertools.combinations(positions, 15):\n        current_selection = selected_positions + list(additional_positions)\n        if check_selection(current_selection):\n            return current_selection\n\n# Get the selected positions\nselected_positions = select_numbers()\n\n# Print the selected positions\nprint(', '.join(f\"{r} {c}\" for r, c in selected_positions))\n```\n\nThis script will attempt to find a valid selection of 16 numbers that satisfy the conditions.
