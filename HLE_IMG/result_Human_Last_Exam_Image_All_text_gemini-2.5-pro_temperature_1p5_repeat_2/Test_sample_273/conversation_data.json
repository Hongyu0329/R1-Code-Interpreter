    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Chiral Centers**\nFirst, we need to identify all the carbon atoms that are chiral centers. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. In the given molecule, there are three such centers. For clarity, let's number the carbon atoms according to IUPAC nomenclature.\n\n1.  **Find the principal functional group:** The molecule contains a hydroxyl (-OH) group and an amino (-NH2) group. According to IUPAC priority rules, the alcohol (-OH) is the principal functional group.\n2.  **Find the longest carbon chain containing the principal group:** The longest carbon chain that includes the carbon atom bearing the -OH group is a pentane chain.\n3.  **Number the chain:** We number the chain from the end that gives the carbon with the -OH group the lowest possible number.\n    *   Let's trace the longest chain: The structure is `CH3-CH(OH)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2NH2`.\n    *   The longest chain containing the `CH(OH)` group is 5 carbons long. The correct IUPAC name is **4-(aminomethyl)-3-ethylpentan-2-ol**.\n    *   Numbering starts from the methyl group on the left:\n        *   **C1**: The `CH3` group attached to C2.\n        *   **C2**: The carbon atom bonded to the `-OH` group. This is a chiral center.\n        *   **C3**: The carbon atom bonded to the ethyl group. This is a chiral center.\n        *   **C4**: The carbon atom bonded to a methyl group and an aminomethyl group (`-CH2NH2`). This is a chiral center.\n        *   **C5**: Not part of the main chain, but part of the ethyl group or aminomethyl group.\n\nSo, the chiral centers are C2, C3, and C4. We will determine the configuration (R or S) for each of them.\n\n**Step 2: Assign Priorities to Groups on Each Chiral Center (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog Rules)**\n\nThe priority of a group is determined by the atomic number of the atom directly bonded to the chiral center. Higher atomic number gets higher priority. If there's a tie, we look at the atoms attached to the tied atoms.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Configuration of Each Chiral Center**\n\n**Analysis of C2:**\n*   **Groups attached to C2:** `-OH`, `-C3H(Et)(C4)`, `-CH3` (this is C1), `-H`.\n*   **Priorities:**\n    1.  `-OH` (Oxygen, Z=8) - **Priority 1**\n    2.  `-C3H(Et)(C4)` (Carbon bonded to two other carbons and a hydrogen) - **Priority 2**\n    3.  `-CH3` (Carbon bonded to three hydrogens) - **Priority 3**\n    4.  `-H` (Hydrogen, Z=1) - **Priority 4**\n*   **Spatial Orientation:** The drawing shows both `-OH` (Priority 1) and `-CH3` (Priority 3) on dashed bonds (pointing away from the viewer). For a tetrahedral carbon, this implies that the other two bonds (`-C3` and `-H`) are on wedged bonds (pointing towards the viewer). The lowest priority group, `-H` (Priority 4), is on a wedge.\n*   **Determination:**\n    1.  Trace the path from priority 1 to 2 to 3: `OH -> C3 -> CH3`.\n    2.  Visualize this: `-OH` is back-left, `-C3` is front-right, `-CH3` is back-right. The path from 1 -> 2 -> 3 is **clockwise**.\n    3.  Since the lowest priority group (`-H`) is pointing towards the viewer (wedge), we must reverse the configuration.\n    4.  Clockwise (R) becomes Counter-clockwise (S).  *Correction*: Let's re-visualize. From the front, 1 (back) -> 2 (front) -> 3 (back). A more robust method is a swap. Swap H(4, wedge) and OH(1, dash). New arrangement: H(4, dash), OH(1, wedge), C3(2, wedge), CH3(3, dash). Now trace 1->2->3. From OH(1, wedge) to C3(2, wedge) to CH3(3, dash) is a **clockwise** path (R). Since we did one swap, the original configuration is also **R**.\n*   **Configuration of C2 is R.**\n\n**Analysis of C3:**\n*   **Groups attached to C3:** `-C2H(OH)CH3`, `-C4H(CH3)(CH2NH2)`, `-CH2CH3` (ethyl), `-H`.\n*   **Priorities:**\n    1.  `-C2H(OH)CH3` (Carbon bonded to a carbon which is bonded to Oxygen) - **Priority 1**\n    2.  `-C4H(CH3)(CH2NH2)` (Carbon bonded to a carbon which is bonded to Nitrogen) - **Priority 2** (O has higher priority than N).\n    3.  `-CH2CH3` (ethyl group) - **Priority 3**\n    4.  `-H` - **Priority 4**\n*   **Spatial Orientation:** The ethyl group (`-CH2CH3`, Priority 3) is on a wedged bond (solid). In a standard zigzag representation, if one substituent is on a wedge, the implicit hydrogen is on a dash. So, `-H` (Priority 4) is pointing away.\n*   **Determination:**\n    1.  Since the lowest priority group (`-H`) is pointing away, we can directly determine the configuration.\n    2.  Trace the path from priority 1 to 2 to 3: `C2 -> C4 -> Ethyl`.\n    3.  This path goes from left to right to up/front. This is a **counter-clockwise** direction.\n*   **Configuration of C3 is S.**\n\n**Analysis of C4:**\n*   **Groups attached to C4:** `-CH2NH2`, `-C3H(Et)(C2)`, `-CH3`, `-H`.\n*   **Priorities:**\n    1.  `-CH2NH2` (Carbon bonded to Nitrogen) - **Priority 1**\n    2.  `-C3H(Et)(C2)` (Carbon bonded to two other carbons) - **Priority 2**\n    3.  `-CH3` (Carbon bonded to three hydrogens) - **Priority 3**\n    4.  `-H` - **Priority 4**\n*   **Spatial Orientation:** The `-CH2NH2` group (Priority 1) is on a wedge (pointing out), and the `-CH3` group (Priority 3) is on a dash (pointing back). This implies the `-C3` bond and the `-H` bond are in the plane of the drawing.\n*   **Determination:**\n    1.  The lowest priority group (`-H`) is in the plane. We can use a swap method for accuracy.\n    2.  Swap `-H` (4, plane) with `-CH3` (3, dash).\n    3.  New orientation: `-H` is on a dash, `-CH3` is in the plane. `-CH2NH2` is still on a wedge, and `-C3` is in the plane.\n    4.  Now that `-H` is pointing away, trace the new path 1 -> 2 -> 3: `-CH2NH2 -> C3 -> CH3`.\n    5.  This path from front (wedge) to left (plane) to up (plane) is **counter-clockwise**. So the configuration of the swapped molecule is S.\n    6.  Since we performed one swap, the configuration of the original molecule is the opposite.\n*   **Configuration of C4 is R.**\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe absolute configurations of the chiral centers are:\n*   C2 is **R**\n*   C3 is **S**\n*   C4 is **R**\n\nTherefore, the full stereochemical description of the molecule is (2R, 3S, 4R).\n\n<<(2R, 3S, 4R)>>>"
