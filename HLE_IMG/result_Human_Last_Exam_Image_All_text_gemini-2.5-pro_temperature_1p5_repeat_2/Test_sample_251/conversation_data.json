    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the ECG Calibration:** The top-left corner of the ECG strip indicates the standard calibration settings: a paper speed of **25 mm/sec** and an amplitude of **1 cm/mV**. For measuring time intervals, the paper speed is the crucial value.\n\n2.  **Calculate Time per Grid Square:** The ECG paper is a grid. We can calculate the time duration represented by each square based on the paper speed.\n    *   The grid has small squares of 1 mm and large squares of 5 mm.\n    *   Time for one small square (1 mm) = 1 mm / 25 mm/sec = **0.04 seconds**.\n    *   Time for one large square (5 mm) = 5 mm / 25 mm/sec = 5 * 0.04 seconds = **0.2 seconds**.\n\n3.  **Identify the R-R Interval:** The R-R interval is the time elapsed between two consecutive R-waves (the tall, sharp peaks of the QRS complex).\n\n4.  **Locate the Longest R-R Interval:** Scan the entire rhythm strip visually to find the widest gap between two consecutive R-waves. Most of the rhythm is relatively fast and regular. However, on the fourth line of the tracing (the line containing the timestamp \"0:06:08\"), there is a very noticeable pause or long interval in the middle of the line. This is visually the longest R-R interval in the entire recording.\n\n5.  **Measure the Longest Interval:** Let's measure the distance between the peak of the R-wave just before the pause and the peak of the R-wave just after the pause on this fourth line.\n    *   The peak of the R-wave before the pause aligns almost perfectly with a thick vertical grid line.\n    *   We then count the number of large squares until the peak of the next R-wave.\n    *   Counting from the first R-wave's peak, we find there are exactly **7 large squares** until the peak of the next R-wave, which also aligns neatly with a thick vertical grid line.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Duration in Seconds:** Now, we convert the measurement from large squares into seconds.\n    *   Duration = (Number of large squares) × (Time per large square)\n    *   Duration = 7 × 0.2 seconds\n    *   Duration = **1.4 seconds**\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Confirm Paper Speed:** Always verify the paper speed printed on the ECG (25 mm/sec in this case) as it's fundamental to the calculation.\n*   **Precise Measurement:** For accurate measurement, identify the very peak of the R-wave. In this strip, the peaks align well with the grid, simplifying the measurement.\n*   **Thorough Scanning:** It is important to look over the entire strip to ensure that the visually identified interval is indeed the longest. In this case, the pause is exceptionally long compared to the baseline rhythm, making it easy to identify.\n\nThe longest R-R interval is measured to be 7 large squares, which corresponds to a duration of 1.4 seconds.\n\n<<<1.4>>>"
