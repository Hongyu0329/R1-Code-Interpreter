    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scientific name of the animal in the image.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual characteristics of the animal.**\nThe image shows a small insect. We need to carefully observe its features to identify it.\n*   **Coloration:** The insect has a striking pattern of black and bright orange/red. This type of coloration is known as aposematism, which often warns predators that the insect is distasteful or toxic.\n*   **Body Parts:**\n    *   **Head:** The head is predominantly black with some small orange markings near the prominent compound eyes.\n    *   **Antennae:** There are two long, black antennae.\n    *   **Thorax:** The section behind the head (the pronotum) has a distinct orange band across it.\n    *   **Abdomen/Wings:** The wings covering the abdomen are mostly black with orange-red margins. Although we see the insect from the side, this pattern is consistent with the \"X\" or \"V\" shape seen on the back of this species when viewed from above.\n    *   **Legs:** The insect has six black legs.\n*   **Body Shape:** The overall shape is a slightly flattened oval, which is typical for a \"true bug\".\n\n**Step 2: Identify the general type of animal.**\nBased on the characteristics above (six legs, antennae, distinct body segments), it is an insect. The presence of what appears to be partially hardened forewings (hemelytra) and piercing-sucking mouthparts (not clearly visible but inferred from the bug type) places it in the order Hemiptera, the true bugs.\n\n**Step 3: Narrow down the identification.**\nThe specific combination of features, especially the black and orange warning coloration and the pattern on the pronotum and wings, strongly suggests a species within the Lygaeidae family, commonly known as seed bugs. This specific pattern is highly characteristic of the Small Milkweed Bug.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the identification.**\n*   **Common Name:** Small Milkweed Bug.\n*   **Scientific Name:** *Lygaeus kalmii*.\n*   **Comparison:** The visual details in the image align perfectly with descriptions and photos of *Lygaeus kalmii*. It has the black head, the orange band on the pronotum, and the orange-bordered wings.\n*   **Habitat/Context:** Small Milkweed Bugs are famous for feeding on milkweed plants, but adults also frequently visit other flowers for nectar. The yellow flower in the image appears to be a goldenrod (*Solidago*), a common nectar source for many insects, including *Lygaeus kalmii*, in late summer and fall. This context supports the identification.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the identification and provide the scientific name.**\nThe analysis of the insect's morphology, coloration, and context confirms that it is a Small Milkweed Bug. The question asks for the scientific name.\n\nThe scientific name is composed of the genus and species. For the Small Milkweed Bug, this is *Lygaeus kalmii*.\n\n<<<Lygaeus kalmii>>>"
