    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Sheet Music:**\n    *   **Clef and Time Signature:** The music is written in the treble clef with a 4/4 time signature.\n    *   **Tempo:** A tempo marking at the top left indicates \"MOD.\" (Moderato) and a metronome marking of a quarter note = 120. This suggests a medium, walking tempo.\n    *   **Notation Style:** This is a \"lead sheet.\" It provides the main melody line and chord symbols (e.g., C, E7, F, G7) above the staff. This format is common for jazz, pop, and other genres where improvisation or chordal accompaniment is expected.\n    *   **Structure:** The piece uses standard musical road map instructions like repeats, a *Dal Segno* sign (the S-like symbol 𝄋), and instructions \"TO GO OUT - TAKE D.S. TO CODA,\" indicating a jump to a final section (Coda).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Musical Content (Melody and Harmony):**\n    *   **Melody:** The melody is highly syncopated, featuring many eighth notes. The first four measures, in the key of C Major, are: G-G-E-G | F#-G-A-B | C-B-A-G | A-G-F#-G.\n    *   **Harmony:** The chord progression is sophisticated. The first line is C | E7 | F | F#° G7 |. This progression, particularly the V7/vi chord (E7, the dominant of A minor) followed by the subdominant (F), and the use of a passing diminished chord (F#°), is characteristic of certain jazz and Latin-American styles.\n\n3.  **Identify the Song:**\n    *   The melodic contour and the specific chord progression in the first few bars are highly distinctive. A search for a song in C Major with the melody G-G-E-G and the chord progression C - E7 - F - G7 quickly leads to one famous piece.\n    *   This opening theme is the unmistakable signature of the song **\"Tico-Tico no Fubá.\"**\n\n4.  **Determine the Musical Style and Origin:**\n    *   **Title:** \"Tico-Tico no Fubá\" was composed by the Brazilian musician Zequinha de Abreu in 1917. The title translates to \"Sparrow in the Cornmeal.\"\n    *   **Musical Style:** The song is a prime example of the **Choro** style. Choro is an instrumental Brazilian popular music genre that originated in 19th-century Rio de Janeiro. It is known for its fast, syncopated rhythms, complex harmonies, and emphasis on virtuosity and improvisation. While often played in a Samba or general \"Latin Jazz\" style, its core identity is Choro.\n    *   **Country of Origin:** As the song was written by a Brazilian composer and is a cornerstone of the Choro genre, its country of origin is **Brazil**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n*   **Title:** Tico-Tico no Fubá\n*   **Musical Style:** Choro\n*   **Country of Origin:** Brazil\n\n<<<Title: Tico-Tico no Fubá\nMusical Style: Choro\nCountry of Origin: Brazil>>>"
