    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the Question's Textual Clues**\n    *   The question describes an \"illusion.\" This means what is perceived is different from what is physically present.\n    *   It is compared to the \"Necker Cube's bistable ambiguity.\" The Necker Cube is a visual illusion where a 2D drawing of a cube can be perceived in two different 3D orientations. This clue suggests the phenomenon in question involves an ambiguous stimulus that the brain can interpret in more than one way.\n    *   It is described as a \"surprisingly common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability.\" This implies it's a fundamental process of our sensory system that happens automatically.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the Image's Content**\n    *   The image contains two graphs that represent a sound stimulus over time. The horizontal axis in both is time.\n    *   **Top Graph (Spectrogram):** This graph shows the frequency components of a sound over time.\n        *   On the left, there is a single, solid horizontal line, representing a pure tone of a constant frequency.\n        *   In the middle, this line is interrupted. Instead, there is a vertical band of blue color, which represents a burst of noise containing a wide range of frequencies.\n        *   On the right, after the noise, there are *two* distinct horizontal lines, indicating that the sound now consists of two different pure tones played simultaneously.\n    *   **Bottom Graph (Waveform):** This graph shows the amplitude of the sound wave over time.\n        *   On the left, the waveform is a regular sine wave, consistent with a single pure tone.\n        *   In the middle, the waveform becomes complex and random-looking, consistent with noise.\n        *   On the right, the waveform is periodic but complex (not a simple sine wave), which is what you get when you add two sine waves of different frequencies together.\n\n*   **Step 3: Synthesize the Clues to Identify the Phenomenon**\n    *   The graphs depict a physical stimulus where a tone stops, is replaced by noise, and then a different sound (two tones) begins.\n    *   The illusion described occurs when a person listens to this stimulus. The brain tends to perceive the initial tone as *continuing uninterrupted through the noise*. The noise is perceived as a separate auditory event that is merely masking the ongoing tone.\n    *   This \"filling-in\" of the missing sound is the \"unconscious perceptual ability.\" The brain assumes continuity because in the natural world, a continuous sound is often temporarily masked by a sudden, louder noise.\n    *   The bistable ambiguity lies in the two possible perceptions: 1) The tone stops and is replaced by noise, or 2) The tone continues \"behind\" the noise. Our brain strongly favors the second interpretation.\n    *   This perceptual phenomenon, where a sound is perceived as continuous even when interrupted by another sound, is known as the **Continuity Illusion** or the **Auditory Continuity Illusion**. It is a classic example of auditory scene analysis and temporal induction.\n\n*   **Step 4: Final Conclusion**\n    *   The combination of the visual representation of the auditory stimulus (a tone interrupted by noise) and the description of the resulting perceptual experience (ambiguity, filling-in) points directly to the well-documented psychoacoustic effect called the Continuity Illusion.\n\n<<<Continuity Illusion>>>"
