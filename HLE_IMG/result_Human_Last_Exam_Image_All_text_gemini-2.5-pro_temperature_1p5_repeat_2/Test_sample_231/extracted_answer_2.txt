The final compound C is an anionic species. Its structure features the trioxatriangulenium core. Attached to the three symmetrical positions on the outer edge of this core are one diethylamino group (-NEt₂) and two phenoxide groups (-O⁻). The core itself retains its delocalized positive charge, leading to an overall charge of -1 for the molecule.
