    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the country based on the Google Trends chart.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the request and the provided data.**\nThe goal is to identify a country based on the Google Trends data for three historic events. The key information is that these are recurring events, specific to one country, and a historian would recognize them. The chart shows relative search interest over time, from December 2019 to mid-2023. We need to analyze the timing of the peaks for each of the three colored lines.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the pattern of the yellow line.**\n*   The yellow line shows a distinct, sharp peak once every year.\n*   The timing of this peak is consistently in late May. The last peak on the chart, which is the highest point (100), occurs right around the date marker \"May 28, 2023\".\n*   This pattern strongly suggests an annual holiday or commemoration in late May. In the context of national historic events, **Memorial Day** in the United States is celebrated on the last Monday of May, fitting this pattern perfectly.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the pattern of the red line.**\n*   The red line shows a very strong peak every year in late January or early February. It is often the most prominent peak of the year, apart from the unusually high yellow peak in 2023.\n*   This timing points to a major annual event at the beginning of the year. In the United States, **Martin Luther King Jr. Day** is a federal holiday observed on the third Monday of January. Additionally, **Black History Month** begins on February 1st. Both are significant historical commemorations that would generate high search interest during this period. The red line likely represents one or both of these.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the pattern of the blue line.**\n*   The blue line shows a smaller, but clear and consistent, peak every year in mid-to-late June.\n*   This points to an annual commemoration in June. In the United States, **Juneteenth** is celebrated on June 19th to commemorate the end of slavery. It became a federal holiday in 2021, which aligns with its consistent and visible presence in search trends during this period.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the findings and confirm the country.**\n*   We have identified three major American historical commemorations that align perfectly with the timing of the annual peaks shown on the graph:\n    *   **Yellow Line:** Memorial Day (late May)\n    *   **Red Line:** Martin Luther King Jr. Day / Black History Month (late January / early February)\n    *   **Blue Line:** Juneteenth (mid-June)\n*   These three events are unique to the history and culture of the United States. A historian, particularly one familiar with U.S. history, would recognize this specific combination of annual observances.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe pattern of annual search interest spikes corresponds directly to major historical commemorations in the United States: Memorial Day, Martin Luther King Jr. Day/Black History Month, and Juneteenth. Therefore, the country is the United States.\n\n<<<United States>>>"
