*   **Product A:** A is the result of a Michael addition. The intermediate ketone, 1-(3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-2-yl)-2-acetylpyrrolidine, is formed by decarboxylation of the mixed anhydride C. The enolate of this ketone then adds to methyl propiolate. The structure of A is methyl (E)-4-(2-(1-(3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-2-yl)pyrrolidin-2-yl)-2-oxoethyl)but-2-enoate.

*   **Product B:** B is formed via a Michael addition of the starting material to methyl propiolate, followed by an intramolecular cyclization that eliminates methanol to form a new five-membered anhydride ring fused to the proline ring.

*   **Product C:** C is the mixed anhydride formed by the reaction of the carboxylic acid group of the starting material with acetic anhydride.
