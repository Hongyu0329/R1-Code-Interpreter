    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sorting algorithm to determine its worst-case time complexity.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Algorithm's Logic**\n\nThe algorithm is defined by the recursive function `sort(a, n)`. Let's break down its operation for `n > 1`:\n\n1.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: The first step is to recursively call the `sort` function on the first `n-1` elements of the array `a` (i.e., the subarray `a[0...n-2]`). After this call, we can assume that these `n-1` elements are sorted amongst themselves.\n2.  `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]`: The algorithm then compares the last element (`a[n-1]`) with the second-to-last element (`a[n-2]`). Since the first `n-1` elements are sorted, `a[n-2]` is the largest among them.\n3.  `swap(a[n-1], a[n - 2])`: If the last element is smaller than the largest element of the sorted prefix, they are swapped. This action moves a smaller element into the prefix `a[0...n-2]`, which breaks the sorted order of that prefix.\n4.  `sort(a, n - 1)`: To fix the newly unsorted prefix, the algorithm calls `sort(a, n - 1)` *again*. This second call is conditional and only happens if the swap occurred.\n\nThis process can be seen as a variation of Bubble Sort. It correctly places the largest element of the subarray `a[0...n-1]` at index `n-1`. However, the way it handles an out-of-place element is highly inefficientâ€”by completely re-sorting the prefix instead of just bubbling the new element down.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Recurrence Relation for Time Complexity**\n\nLet `T(n)` be the time complexity of the function `sort(a, n)`. We need to analyze the worst-case scenario.\n\n*   **Base Case:** If `n <= 1`, the function does nothing and returns. The time taken is constant, `T(1) = O(1)`.\n*   **Recursive Step (n > 1):** The function performs:\n    *   One recursive call: `sort(a, n - 1)`. This takes `T(n-1)` time.\n    *   A constant number of operations: one comparison and possibly one swap. Let's denote this as `O(1)`.\n    *   A potential second recursive call: `sort(a, n - 1)`. This also takes `T(n-1)` time.\n\nThe worst case occurs when the `if` condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` is always true, forcing the second recursive call to be executed at every step of the recursion.\n\nSo, the worst-case recurrence relation is:\n`T(n) = T(n - 1) + O(1) + T(n - 1)`\n`T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c` (where `c` is a constant)\n\n**Step 3: Solve the Recurrence Relation**\n\nWe need to solve `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`. We can do this by expansion:\n\n*   `T(n) = 2 * T(n-1) + c`\n*   `T(n) = 2 * [2 * T(n-2) + c] + c = 4 * T(n-2) + 2c + c`\n*   `T(n) = 4 * [2 * T(n-3) + c] + 3c = 8 * T(n-3) + 4c + 2c + c`\n*   ...after `k` steps...\n*   `T(n) = 2^k * T(n-k) + c * (2^(k-1) + 2^(k-2) + ... + 1)`\n\nThe sum in the parenthesis is a geometric series equal to `(2^k - 1)`. So:\n`T(n) = 2^k * T(n-k) + c * (2^k - 1)`\n\nWe continue until we reach the base case, `T(1)`. This happens when `n-k = 1`, or `k = n-1`.\nSubstituting `k = n-1`:\n`T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)`\n\nSince `T(1)` is a constant, let's call it `c'`.\n`T(n) = 2^(n-1) * c' + c * 2^(n-1) - c`\n`T(n) = (c' + c) * 2^(n-1) - c`\n\nIn big O notation, the constant factors and lower-order terms are ignored. The dominant term is `2^(n-1)`, which is proportional to `2^n`.\nTherefore, `T(n) = O(2^n)`.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Worst-Case Input**\n\nThe worst-case scenario occurs when the condition `a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]` is met as often as possible. Consider a reverse-sorted array, e.g., `a = [n, n-1, n-2, ..., 1]`.\n\n*   `sort(a, n)`:\n    1.  `sort(a, n-1)` is called on `[n, n-1, ..., 2]`. After this completes, the array becomes `[2, 3, ..., n, 1]`. The prefix `a[0...n-2]` is now sorted.\n    2.  The condition `if a[n-1] < a[n-2]` becomes `if 1 < n`, which is true.\n    3.  A swap occurs, and the array becomes `[2, 3, ..., 1, n]`.\n    4.  The second call `sort(a, n-1)` is triggered on a subarray that is again \"badly\" sorted, ensuring the recursion continues in a worst-case fashion.\n\nThis confirms that a reverse-sorted array serves as a worst-case input, leading to the `O(2^n)` complexity.\n\n**Careful Points Checklist:**\n1.  **Analyze the base case:** The recursion terminates when `n <= 1`. This is correct.\n2.  **Analyze the recursive step:** Identify all operations, including the conditional recursive call.\n3.  **Determine the worst-case condition:** The worst case happens when the second recursive call is always made. This requires the `if` condition to be true.\n4.  **Formulate the recurrence relation:** Based on the worst case, the relation is `T(n) = 2T(n-1) + c`.\n5.  **Solve the recurrence relation:** Expansion or other methods show the solution is exponential.\n6.  **Verify the answer choice:** Match the derived complexity `O(2^n)` with the given options.\n\nConclusion: The time complexity in the worst case is exponential.\n\n<<<E>>>"
