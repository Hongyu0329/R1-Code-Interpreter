    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n**Analysis of the Question and Careful Points:**\n\n1.  **Objective:** The goal is to calculate the percentage reduction in Car Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) by comparing the \"Proposed\" scenario (Table 2) to the \"Baseline\" scenario (Table 1).\n\n2.  **Understanding VMT:** VMT stands for Vehicle Miles Traveled. It is the total mileage driven by vehicles. We need to calculate the VMT specifically for cars. The car category is split into \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\". For VMT calculation, we need to sum the miles traveled by both types of car trips.\n\n3.  **Key Information vs. Distractors:** The tables provide mode share percentages for trips within specific distance categories. The key data points are:\n    *   The \"share of total trips\" for each distance bracket (e.g., 48% of all trips are 0-3 miles long).\n    *   The \"mode share\" for car trips within each distance bracket (e.g., in the baseline, 25% of 0-3 mile trips are by 'car, 1 occupant').\n    *   The \"Average trip distance\" for each bracket (e.g., trips in the 0-3 mile bracket average 1 mile).\n    *   A potential distractor is the \"Average Carpool Occupancy\". This data is needed to calculate Person Miles Traveled (PMT), but not Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT). Since a carpool trip is still a single vehicle trip, we do not need to use the occupancy number.\n\n4.  **Calculation Strategy:** We cannot calculate the absolute total VMT without knowing the total number of trips in the system. However, we can calculate a proportional VMT for each scenario, which can be interpreted as the average VMT per trip across the entire system. The percentage reduction calculated from these proportional values will be accurate. The formula for the proportional VMT is a weighted sum:\n    `Proportional VMT = Σ [(Share of Total Trips in category) × (Average Trip Distance) × (Share of Car Trips in category)]`\n\n---\n\n**Step-by-Step Calculation:**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Proportional Car VMT for the Baseline Scenario (Table 1)**\n\nWe calculate the VMT contribution from each distance category and sum them up. The share of car trips is the sum of \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\".\n\n*   **0-3 miles:**\n    `0.48 (trip share) × 1 (avg dist) × (0.25 + 0.28) (car share) = 0.48 × 1 × 0.53 = 0.2544`\n*   **3-5 miles:**\n    `0.22 (trip share) × 4 (avg dist) × (0.38 + 0.43) (car share) = 0.88 × 0.81 = 0.7128`\n*   **5-10 miles:**\n    `0.14 (trip share) × 7.5 (avg dist) × (0.40 + 0.45) (car share) = 1.05 × 0.85 = 0.8925`\n*   **10+ miles:**\n    `0.16 (trip share) × 20 (avg dist) × (0.42 + 0.47) (car share) = 3.2 × 0.89 = 2.8480`\n\n*   **Total Baseline Proportional VMT:**\n    `VMT_Baseline = 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = 4.7077`\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Proportional Car VMT for the Proposed Scenario (Table 2)**\n\nWe repeat the same calculation using the mode share data from Table 2.\n\n*   **0-3 miles:**\n    `0.48 (trip share) × 1 (avg dist) × (0.01 + 0.02) (car share) = 0.48 × 1 × 0.03 = 0.0144`\n*   **3-5 miles:**\n    `0.22 (trip share) × 4 (avg dist) × (0.08 + 0.19) (car share) = 0.88 × 0.27 = 0.2376`\n*   **5-10 miles:**\n    `0.14 (trip share) × 7.5 (avg dist) × (0.14 + 0.27) (car share) = 1.05 × 0.41 = 0.4305`\n*   **10+ miles:**\n    `0.16 (trip share) × 20 (avg dist) × (0.16 + 0.33) (car share) = 3.2 × 0.49 = 1.5680`\n\n*   **Total Proposed Proportional VMT:**\n    `VMT_Proposed = 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = 2.2505`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Percentage Reduction**\n\nUse the standard formula for percentage change.\n\n*   **VMT Reduction:** `VMT_Baseline - VMT_Proposed = 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572`\n*   **Percentage Reduction:** `(VMT Reduction / VMT_Baseline) × 100%`\n*   **Percentage Reduction:** `(2.4572 / 4.7077) × 100% ≈ 52.195%`\n\nRounding to one decimal place gives 52.2%.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
