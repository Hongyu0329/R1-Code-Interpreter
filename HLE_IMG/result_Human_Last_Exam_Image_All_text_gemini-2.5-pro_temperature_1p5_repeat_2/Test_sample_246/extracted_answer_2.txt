Yes, there is clear evidence of insect activity. The prominent white, fuzzy sphere on the twig is an insect-induced growth called a wool sower gall. This gall is created by a cynipid wasp. The female wasp lays her eggs by injecting them directly into the woody tissue of the oak twig. The gall then forms around the site of the eggs, serving as a protective nursery where the larvae will hatch, feed, and develop. Therefore, the insect lays its eggs inside the oak twig.
