    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to identify the black organism.\n\n**Step 1: Initial Observation of the Scene**\nThe photograph shows a close-up of organisms growing on what appears to be a tree trunk or decaying wood. The most prominent organisms are the whitish-tan, shelf-like bracket fungi. There is also a patch of bright green moss visible towards the top left. The question specifically asks to identify the \"black organism\".\n\n**Step 2: Locating the Black Organism**\nThe large bracket fungi themselves are not black, but mostly white, beige, and tan. The moss is green. The substrate is dark brown/black. However, looking closely at the top surfaces of the shelf fungi, particularly in the center of the main image and in the detailed crop images, we can see numerous tiny, black, bristle-like structures. These are the \"black organisms\" the question refers to.\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the Morphology of the Black Organism**\nThese structures are very small and look like tiny hairs or pins sticking out of the surface of the larger fungus. Each structure consists of a very thin, dark stalk (called a seta) and a tiny, often rounded head. This pin-like morphology is characteristic of a specific type of fungus.\n\n**Step 4: Identifying the Relationship and the Organism**\nThese tiny black structures are a separate organism from the larger shelf fungus they are growing on. This is a case of mycoparasitism, where one fungus lives as a parasite on another fungus. The host fungus is likely a species of polypore, such as *Trichaptum biforme* (Violet-toothed Polypore), which is a very common host for this parasite. The small black parasite is a type of mold. Based on its distinct pin-like shape and its parasitic nature on other fungi, it is identified as a fungus in the genus *Hirsutella*. *Hirsutella* species are the asexual forms (anamorphs) of fungi in the cordyceps family, like *Ophiocordyceps*.\n\n**Step 5: Conclusion**\nThe black organism is a mycoparasitic fungus that grows on the larger bracket fungus. Its scientific name is *Hirsutella*. It is sometimes colloquially known as \"hairy pin mold\".\n\n<<<Hirsutella>>>"
