Product A (C14H20N2O3): The primary [3+2] cycloadduct (P1) which has been subsequently acetylated on the enamine Î²-carbon.
Product B (C12H14N2O3): The primary [3+2] cycloadduct (P1) which has undergone two oxidations: aromatization of the newly formed ring and oxidation of a ring CH2 group to a carbonyl (lactam).
Product C (C11H16N2O3): The primary [3+2] cycloadduct (P1) in which the methyl ester is converted to a carboxylic acid, and the pyrroline nitrogen in the substituent is oxidized to an N-oxide.
