    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the biological sexes of the insects in each pair.\n\n**General Principles for Sexing Bees and Wasps (Hymenoptera):**\n\nTo determine the sex of the insects, we look for sexually dimorphic characteristics, which are consistent physical differences between males and females of the same species. Key features include:\n*   **Antennae:** Males often have longer antennae with more segments (typically 13) than females (typically 12). In some species, male antennae are also distinctly shaped (e.g., curled).\n*   **Abdomen:** Females have 6 visible abdominal segments and a stinger (a modified ovipositor, or egg-laying tube) at the tip, which can make the abdomen appear pointed. Males have 7 visible segments and lack a stinger, often having a blunter abdominal tip or visible claspers.\n*   **Face:** In many bee and some wasp species, males have yellow or white markings on their face (clypeus), whereas females have a dark face.\n*   **Pollen-Collecting Hairs (Scopae):** The prompt states these are from taxa \"without scopae on their legs\". This suggests we might be looking at wasps, cleptoparasitic (cuckoo) bees, or bees that carry pollen internally or on their abdomen. Female bees that do collect pollen typically have dense brushes of hair (scopae) for this purpose, which males lack.\n\n**Analysis of Pair A:**\n\n*   **Identification:** These appear to be cuckoo bees of the genus *Coelioxys*. These bees are cleptoparasites, meaning they lay their eggs in the nests of other bees (like leafcutter bees). The females do not collect pollen to provision nests, so they lack scopae, fitting the question's description.\n*   **Insect A (Left):** This individual has a distinctly pointed and tapered abdomen, ending in a sharp point. This is the characteristic abdomen of a female *Coelioxys*, which she uses to pierce the host's nest cell wall to lay her egg.\n*   **Insect A (Right):** This individual has a much blunter abdominal tip that ends in several spines or projections. This is the characteristic abdomen of a male *Coelioxys*.\n*   **Conclusion for Pair A:** Left is Female, Right is Male (F, M). This corresponds to option **4**.\n\n**Analysis of Pair B:**\n\n*   **Identification:** These are paper wasps, likely of the genus *Polistes*. Wasps are carnivorous and do not collect pollen, so they lack scopae, fitting the question's description. They do, however, feed on nectar.\n*   **Insect B (Left):** The most telling feature is the antennae, which are clearly curled or hooked at the tips. This is a classic characteristic of male paper wasps.\n*   **Insect B (Right):** The antennae on this wasp are straight, not curled. This is characteristic of a female paper wasp. Additionally, the abdomen tapers to a point where the stinger would be.\n*   **Conclusion for Pair B:** Left is Male, Right is Female (M, F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n**Analysis of Pair C:**\n\n*   **Identification:** These bees belong to the group known as \"long-horned bees\" (tribe Eucerini), likely the genus *Melissodes*. The sexual dimorphism in this group is very pronounced. *Note: Female long-horned bees actually do have prominent scopae on their hind legs, which contradicts the prompt's premise. However, the other physical characteristics are so clear that we can confidently determine the sexes despite this discrepancy in the prompt's description.*\n*   **Insect C (Left):** This bee has exceptionally long antennae, much longer than its head, which is the defining feature of males in this group (hence the name \"long-horned bees\"). Its face (clypeus) is also yellowish-white, another common male trait.\n*   **Insect C (Right):** This bee has much shorter antennae, typical for a female of this group. Its face is dark. Its body is robust, which is also typical for a female who would be carrying pollen and developing eggs.\n*   **Conclusion for Pair C:** Left is Male, Right is Female (M, F). This corresponds to option **3**.\n\n**Final Answer Summary:**\n\n*   **Pair A:** Female, Male (F, M) -> Option **4**\n*   **Pair B:** Male, Female (M, F) -> Option **3**\n*   **Pair C:** Male, Female (M, F) -> Option **3**\n\nThe sequence of indices for A, B, and C is 4, 3, 3.\n\n<<<4, 3, 3>>>"
