    "*   **Step 1: Identify the class of compound.** The given structure is a complex molecule containing multiple rings and nitrogen atoms. The presence of nitrogen atoms within heterocyclic rings, especially in a molecule of natural origin, strongly suggests it is an alkaloid.\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the ring system.** The molecule is tetracyclic, meaning it consists of four fused rings. All four rings are six-membered. Two nitrogen atoms are present, integrated into the ring system. This specific arrangement of two fused six-membered rings sharing a nitrogen atom is known as a quinolizidine moiety. The overall structure is composed of two such quinolizidine systems fused together. This skeleton is characteristic of lupin alkaloids.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify key functional groups.** There is a carbonyl group (C=O) present. This carbonyl group is part of an amide functional group that is cyclic, which is known as a lactam. Since the lactam is within a six-membered ring, it is a δ-lactam.\n\n*   **Step 4: Compare the structure with known lupin alkaloids.**\n    *   The parent compound of this family without the carbonyl group is **sparteine**. Sparteine has the same four-ring nitrogen-containing skeleton but is fully saturated (no C=O group).\n    *   The structure shown, with the sparteine skeleton and a carbonyl group at the C-2 position (using the standard numbering for this class of alkaloids), is known as **lupanine**.\n    *   Other related alkaloids like matrine have a different ring fusion pattern (they contain a γ-lactam instead of a δ-lactam). Anagyrine and cytisine also have different structures (anagyrine is aromatic in one ring, cytisine is tricyclic).\n\n*   **Step 5: Consider the stereochemistry.** The use of wedged and dashed bonds indicates a specific stereoisomer. The depicted stereochemistry corresponds to the most common natural isomer of lupanine, often referred to as (-)-lupanine.\n\n*   **Step 6: Conclude the name.** Based on the characteristic tetracyclic quinolizidine skeleton and the presence of a lactam group at the specific position, the compound is identified by its common name, lupanine.\n\n<<<Lupanine>>>"
