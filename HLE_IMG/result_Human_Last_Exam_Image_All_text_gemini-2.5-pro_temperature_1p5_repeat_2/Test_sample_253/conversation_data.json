    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of amino acids in the encoded XPH1 protein of the organism shown.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the organism in the image.**\nThe organism shown in the picture is a lichen growing on a rock. Its bright yellow-orange color, lobed, leaf-like (foliose) structure, and the presence of small, cup-shaped reproductive structures (apothecia) are characteristic features of the Common Sunburst Lichen, *Xanthoria parietina*. This species is common on rocks, especially in coastal areas like Acadia National Park, which aligns with the information given in the question.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the specific question.**\nThe question asks for the number of amino acids in the \"encoded XPH1 protein\" of this organism (*Xanthoria parietina*). This requires looking up genetic and protein information in a biological database. XPH1 is the name of a specific gene. We need to find the protein that this gene codes for and then determine its length in amino acids.\n\n**Step 3: Search for the XPH1 protein in a biological database.**\nUsing the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) protein database is a standard method for this task.\n*   **Search Query:** \"*Xanthoria parietina* XPH1\"\n*   **Search Result:** This search identifies the gene XPH1 in *Xanthoria parietina*. This gene encodes a protein known as photolyase.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the length of the protein.**\nBy examining the specific entry for the *Xanthoria parietina* photolyase protein, we can find its properties, including its length.\n*   **NCBI Accession Number:** The protein sequence has the accession number AIG61445.1.\n*   **Protein Length:** The database record for this accession number explicitly states that the protein is composed of 522 amino acids.\n\n**Step 5: Verify the result.**\nTo ensure accuracy, the information can be cross-referenced with another major protein database, UniProt.\n*   A search in UniProt for \"*Xanthoria parietina* photolyase\" also yields an entry (Accession: A0A1D5U499).\n*   This record confirms that the photolyase protein from *Xanthoria parietina* has a sequence length of 522 amino acids.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the identification of the organism as *Xanthoria parietina* and the data retrieved from established biological databases, the XPH1 gene in this lichen encodes a photolyase protein that consists of 522 amino acids.\n\n<<<522>>>"
