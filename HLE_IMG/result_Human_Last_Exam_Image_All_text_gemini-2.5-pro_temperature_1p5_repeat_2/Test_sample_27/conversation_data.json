    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the artist of the painting:\n\n1.  **Examine the painting for a signature.** The most direct way to identify an artist is to find their signature on the artwork. Looking at the full image, a signature is visible in the bottom right corner.\n2.  **Use the cropped images for a closer look.** One of the provided crops specifically isolates the bottom right corner, making the signature easier to read.\n3.  **Decipher the signature and accompanying text.** The signature appears to read \"marquet\". Below the signature, it says \"Puteaux 38\".\n4.  **Interpret the text.** \"marquet\" is the artist's surname. \"Puteaux\" is a location, a commune in the western suburbs of Paris, France. \"'38\" indicates the year the painting was made, which is 1938.\n5.  **Identify the artist.** Based on the signature \"marquet\" and the style of the painting (a landscape, likely watercolor, with a Fauvist influence), the artist is Albert Marquet. He was a prominent French painter (1875-1947) known for his landscape paintings and cityscapes, often featuring water.\n6.  **Confirm the finding.** A search for works by Albert Marquet from around 1938 reveals paintings with similar styles and signatures. This specific artwork is often titled \"Bord de Mer à Puteaux\" or \"La Seine à Puteaux,\" confirming the location and date seen in the signature area.\n7.  **State the full name.** The question asks for the artist's full name. The artist's full name is Albert Marquet.\n\n<<<Albert Marquet>>>"
