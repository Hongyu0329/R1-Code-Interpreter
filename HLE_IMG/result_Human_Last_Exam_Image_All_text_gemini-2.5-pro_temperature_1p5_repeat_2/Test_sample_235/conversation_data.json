    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the erasure poem to determine its metric pattern.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the words of the poem.**\nThe poem is an erasure or collage poem created by selecting and arranging words on a background image. The highlighted words are:\n\"rules\"\n\"and\"\n\"lines,\"\n\"an intricate spider's web\"\n\"work\"\n\nThese words can be read together as a single phrase or sentence: \"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\".\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the primary text of the poem.**\nLet's count the syllables in this phrase:\n*   **rules**: 1 syllable\n*   **and**: 1 syllable\n*   **lines**: 1 syllable\n*   **an**: 1 syllable\n*   **in-tri-cate**: 3 syllables\n*   **spi-der's**: 2 syllables\n*   **web**: 1 syllable\n*   **work**: 1 syllable\nThe total syllable count for the explicitly added words is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 11 syllables.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the answer choices based on the primary text.**\n*   A. **free verse:** Poetry with no regular meter or rhyme. This is a possibility, as the rhythm seems irregular.\n*   B. **iambic pentameter:** Requires 10 syllables in an unstressed-stressed pattern. Our poem has 11 syllables, so this is incorrect.\n*   C. **alexandrine:** A line of 12 syllables. Our poem has 11, so this is incorrect.\n*   D. **sapphic:** A Sapphic stanza has three 11-syllable lines and one 5-syllable line. While our poem has 11 syllables, matching a single Sapphic line, the stress pattern does not conform to the strict Sapphic meter (trochee, trochee, dactyl, trochee, trochee).\n*   E. **loose iambic trimeter:** A line with three iambic feet, typically 6 syllables. Our poem has 11, so this is incorrect.\n*   F. **american sentence:** A single sentence containing exactly 17 syllables. Our poem has 11, so this seems incorrect based on the primary text alone.\n\n**Step 4: Consider the full context of the artwork.**\nErasure and collage art often incorporate elements from the original source page. Notice the title and page number at the top of the image:\n*   \"THE FIRST STEP\"\n*   \"35\"\n\nLet's see what happens to the syllable count if these elements are intentionally included as part of the poem, a common technique in this art form.\n\n**Step 5: Recalculate the syllables including the header text.**\n*   **The First Step**: \"The\" (1) + \"First\" (1) + \"Step\" (1) = 3 syllables.\n*   **35** (read as \"thirty-five\"): \"thir-ty\" (2) + \"five\" (1) = 3 syllables.\n*   **Primary poem text**: 11 syllables.\n\n**Total syllable count = 3 + 3 + 11 = 17 syllables.**\n\n**Step 6: Re-evaluate the answer choices with the new count.**\nWith a total of 17 syllables, the poem perfectly matches the definition of an **American Sentence**. This poetic form, created by Allen Ginsberg, is a complete sentence that is exactly 17 syllables long, akin to a Western version of a haiku.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe arrangement seems deliberate. The probability that the additional text from the page header would bring the syllable count to exactly 17 by chance is extremely low. Therefore, it is highly likely that the artist intended for the entire composition—including the title and page number—to form a 17-syllable American Sentence. The resulting phrase, \"The First Step thirty-five rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work,\" fits the syllable requirement precisely.\n\n<<<F>>>"
