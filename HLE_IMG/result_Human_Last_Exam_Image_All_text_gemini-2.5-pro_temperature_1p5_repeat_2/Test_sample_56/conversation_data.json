    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the artist of the painting.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Painting's Style and Content**\nThe image provided is a painting rich in symbolic and dream-like elements. It depicts an interior room that opens up into several different, impossible realities.\n*   **Juxtaposition:** The core of the painting is the juxtaposition of a mundane interior (a room with a fireplace, bookshelves, wooden floors) with extraordinary exterior scenes.\n*   **Surreal Elements:** We can observe several surreal and illogical elements:\n    *   The left side of the room is open to a landscape with a bare tree, a vast glacier or ice field, and a hot air balloon.\n    *   One doorway on the right leads to an ocean whose waves are flowing directly into the room and onto the floor. A large steamship is visible in the distance.\n    *   Another doorway reveals a bust of a person with green leaves for hair, looking into the room from a nighttime city scene.\n    *   Books are burning in the fireplace and on the floor in front of it.\n    *   A mirror above the fireplace reflects a plain blue sky, which doesn't match the other visible scenes.\n*   **Artistic Technique:** The painting is executed in a highly detailed, precise, and realistic manner, which makes the fantastical subject matter even more striking. This technique is a hallmark of certain schools of Surrealism.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Art Movement**\nThe combination of ordinary objects in an irrational context, the dream-like atmosphere, and the meticulous rendering are all characteristic of the **Surrealism** movement. The style is not abstract but representational, focusing on creating a \"super-reality.\" It has similarities to the work of artists like René Magritte and Salvador Dalí, but also a unique narrative quality.\n\n**Step 3: Search and Identification**\nBased on the distinctive style and elements, a search for \"surrealist painting room with ocean and burning books\" or a reverse image search can be performed. Such a search quickly identifies the painting.\n*   **Painting Title:** The work is most commonly known as \"Bibliodam\" or \"The Burning of the Books\". On the artist's official website, it is titled \"New-York, New-York\".\n*   **Artist Identification:** The painting is a well-known work by the Polish surrealist painter **Jacek Yerka**.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Artist**\nJacek Yerka (born in 1952) is famous for his fantastical paintings that draw inspiration from his childhood memories, dreams, and the Polish countryside. His style is often called \"4-siders\" because his paintings can sometimes be viewed from four different directions. The artwork in question is a perfect example of his signature style: blending familiar, domestic settings with impossible, detailed landscapes to create a mysterious and thought-provoking world.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBy analyzing the painting's surrealist style, its specific combination of fantastical elements, and confirming this through art historical knowledge and search tools, we can confidently name the artist.\n\n<<<Jacek Yerka>>>"
