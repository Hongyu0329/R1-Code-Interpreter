    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Image:** The image provided is a black-and-white photograph of a circular relief sculpture (a tondo or roundel) set within a larger, ornate frame. The sculpture is a low relief, also known as *rilievo schiacciato*.\n\n2.  **Identify the Subject Matter:** The scene depicts a religious ceremony. A figure in priestly vestments is administering a wafer (the Host) to a kneeling figure. Other figures are kneeling in prayer, awaiting their turn. This scene represents the Christian sacrament of the Eucharist, or Holy Communion.\n\n3.  **Examine the Inscription:** At the bottom of the roundel, there is a cartouche with a visible inscription. The text appears to read \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AUTEL\". This is Old French for \"Sacrament of the Altar,\" which directly corresponds to the scene of the Eucharist being depicted. This inscription is a very strong clue.\n\n4.  **Determine the Artistic Style:** The style of the figures, with their classical features, flowing drapery, and naturalistic poses, is characteristic of the Early Italian Renaissance, specifically the Florentine school of the 15th century. The refinement and grace of the composition point to a master sculptor of that period.\n\n5.  **Synthesize Clues and Research:** Combining the key elements—a 15th-century Florentine relief sculpture, a roundel depicting the Eucharist, and the specific French inscription \"Sacrament of the Altar\"—allows for a targeted search. Research confirms that this is a well-known work. It is a detail from the predella (the base panel) of the **Tabernacle of the Sacrament** (also known as the Peretola Tabernacle or the Altarpiece of the Eucharist).\n\n6.  **Identify the Author:** Art historical sources universally attribute this marble tabernacle to the Florentine sculptor **Luca della Robbia**. He created it between 1441 and 1443 for the Chapel of Saint Luke in the hospital of Santa Maria Nuova in Florence. It is now housed in the church of Santa Maria in Peretola, near Florence.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Medium:** The original is carved from marble, not glazed terracotta for which Luca della Robbia is also famous.\n*   **Inscription Language:** The use of French (\"L'AUTEL\" instead of the Italian \"L'ALTARE\") on a Florentine work is unusual and has been debated by scholars, but the attribution to Luca della Robbia is not in doubt.\n*   **Artwork Detail:** The question asks about a \"detail of the Altarpiece,\" and this roundel is indeed a component of the larger marble altarpiece structure (a tabernacle).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the iconographic, stylistic, and inscriptional evidence, the author of this relief sculpture is the celebrated Italian Renaissance artist Luca della Robbia.\n\n<<<Luca della Robbia>>>"
