    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the puzzle:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue and the image.**\n*   **The Clue:** \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n*   **The Image:** The image shows a younger man with a beard receiving a trophy from an older, white-haired man. The setting appears to be an awards ceremony.\n*   **Identification:** The younger man is identifiable as Nikita Kucherov, a professional ice hockey player. The older man is Gary Bettman, the commissioner of the National Hockey League (NHL). The event is the 2019 NHL Awards, which took place on June 19, 2019, in Las Vegas (the date in the clue is off by one day, which is common in such puzzles). Kucherov won multiple major awards that night, including the Hart Memorial Trophy (MVP), Ted Lindsay Award (most outstanding player), and Art Ross Trophy (top scorer). He is a hockey player.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue.**\n*   **The Clue:** \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n*   **Interpretation:** This clue points to a historical practice or object that has become obsolete because it involved toxic mercury salts.\n*   **Key Connection:** The most famous historical use of mercury salts that led to toxicity is in the felt-making process for hats. Mercury(II) nitrate was used to treat fur, a process called \"carroting.\" The mercury exposure caused neurological damage in hat makers, leading to a condition called erethism, popularly known as \"Mad Hatter's disease.\" This directly connects mercury salt toxicity to the making of hats and to the figure of the \"hatter.\"\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the clues to find \"X Y\".**\n*   We are looking for a two-word term (\"X Y\") that connects the hockey player in the picture with the historical use of mercury in hat making.\n*   The connection from the first clue (Nikita Kucherov, a hockey player) is the term **\"hat trick\"**. A hat trick in hockey is when a single player scores three goals in one game. As the league's top scorer, Kucherov is a prime representative of this achievement.\n*   Now we test \"Hat Trick\" against the second clue using a pun or a second meaning.\n*   The clue states \"Another X Y...\". So, we are looking for another meaning of \"hat trick.\" We can interpret this phrase literally as a \"trick\" (a technique or process) for making \"hats.\"\n*   This interpretation fits perfectly: The old \"trick\" for making \"hats\" (the felting process using mercury nitrate) has \"almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n\n**Step 4: Final Verification.**\n*   **X Y = Hat Trick.**\n*   **Clue 1:** \"Hat Trick is pictured...\" This works metaphorically. A person famous for performing hat tricks (Nikita Kucherov) is pictured.\n*   **Clue 2:** \"Another hat trick...\" This refers to the pun \"a trick for making hats.\" This historical \"trick\" used mercury and is now obsolete due to its toxicity.\n*   All parts of the puzzle are resolved by this single answer, which respects the \"X Y\" two-word format.\n\n<<<Hat trick>>>"
