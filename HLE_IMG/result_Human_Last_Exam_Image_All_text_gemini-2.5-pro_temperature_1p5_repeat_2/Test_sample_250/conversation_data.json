    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the Key and Time Signature**\n    *   The key signature shows no sharps or flats, which would typically indicate C major or A minor. However, the first chord is F minor (F-), and the piece resolves to F minor and F major chords throughout, suggesting the piece is in the key of F minor. This is common in jazz lead sheets, where the key signature of C major is used as a default.\n    *   The time signature is 4/4, indicated by the 'C' symbol (common time).\n\n*   **Step 2: Analyze the Melody**\n    *   The first measure starts on the note C, the fifth of the F minor chord, and outlines the chord. The melody is: C (half note), C (quarter note), G (quarter note).\n    *   The second measure has the notes Bb, F, and C.\n    *   The third measure has the notes Ab, Eb, and Bb.\n    *   This melodic contour is distinctive and can be used for identification.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyze the Chord Progression**\n    *   The chord progression is the most defining characteristic of this piece. Let's look at the \"A\" section (the first section).\n    *   The progression begins: | F- | E-7b5 | Eb-6 | Dbmaj7 G7 |\n    *   This progression features a chromatic descent in the root of the first three chords (F -> E -> Eb). This is a highly recognizable and famous chord sequence in the jazz repertoire.\n    *   The bridge, or \"B\" section, begins after the second ending. The progression is: | D-7b5 | G7 | C7 | F7 | Bb-7 | Eb7 | Ab | G C7 |. This sequence of ii-V-I progressions moving through different key centers is typical for a jazz standard bridge and confirms the structure.\n\n*   **Step 4: Identify the Tune and Composer**\n    *   Based on the unique chromatic descending chord progression in the A-section (F-, E-7b5, Eb-6...) and the recognizable melody, the piece is identified as the jazz standard \"Nica's Dream\".\n    *   \"Nica's Dream\" was composed by the influential hard bop pianist and composer Horace Silver. It was first recorded by the Jazz Messengers in 1956 for the album *The Jazz Messengers*.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n    *   The analysis of the melody and, most definitively, the chord progression, confirms the identity of the song.\n\n<<<Title: Nica's Dream, Composer: Horace Silver>>>"
