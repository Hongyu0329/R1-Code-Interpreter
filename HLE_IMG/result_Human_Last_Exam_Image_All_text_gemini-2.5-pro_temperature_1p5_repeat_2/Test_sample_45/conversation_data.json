    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling.\n\n**Step 1: Understand Rotational Symmetry**\nRotational symmetry means that a shape or pattern looks the same after being rotated by a certain angle around a central point. The \"order\" of rotational symmetry (or n-fold rotational symmetry) is the number of times the pattern looks identical during a full 360-degree rotation. The minimum angle of rotation is 360/n degrees. To determine the rotational symmetry of the tiling, we must find the highest order of rotation possible for any point within the pattern.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Geometric Shapes in the Tiling**\nThe tiling is composed of several distinct polygons:\n*   Dark blue regular hexagons.\n*   Light yellow squares.\n*   Orange rhombuses.\n*   Light yellow irregular pentagons (five-sided polygons).\n\n**Step 3: Search for Potential Centers of Rotation**\nWe can check for rotational symmetry by choosing potential centers and seeing if the pattern maps onto itself when rotated. Good candidates for centers of rotation are the geometric centers of the polygons and the vertices where multiple polygons meet.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Center of a Dark Blue Hexagon**\n1.  Locate a dark blue hexagon in the pattern.\n2.  Consider its center as a potential point of rotation.\n3.  A regular hexagon has 6-fold rotational symmetry by itself (it looks the same after rotations of 60°, 120°, 180°, etc.).\n4.  Now, we must check if the surrounding pattern also respects this symmetry. The hexagon is surrounded by a ring of six identical light yellow pentagons.\n5.  If we rotate the entire pattern by 60° (360°/6) around the center of the hexagon, the hexagon maps onto itself. Each of the six surrounding pentagons also moves into the position of the next pentagon, preserving the pattern.\n6.  Looking further out, the arrangement of squares and rhombuses around this central cluster also aligns perfectly after a 60° rotation.\n7.  Since the entire tiling pattern remains unchanged after a rotation of 60° about this point, it possesses **6-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze Other Potential Centers (for completeness)**\n*   **Center of a Yellow Square:** If we take the center of a yellow square, we can see it is surrounded by four orange rhombuses. This arrangement has **4-fold rotational symmetry** (invariant under 90° rotations).\n*   **Vertex where three Rhombuses meet:** Locate a point where the wider-angled corners of three orange rhombuses meet. Rotating by 120° (360°/3) around this point causes each rhombus to map onto the next one. This indicates a point of **3-fold rotational symmetry**.\n*   **Center of a Rhombus:** The center of any orange rhombus is a point of **2-fold rotational symmetry** (invariant under a 180° rotation).\n\n**Step 6: Conclude the Overall Rotational Symmetry**\nThe tiling exhibits multiple orders of rotational symmetry (2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold) at different locations. When asked for \"the\" rotational symmetry of a periodic tiling, the question refers to the highest order of rotational symmetry present in its symmetry group. In this pattern, the highest order of rotation we found is 6.\n\nTherefore, the rotational symmetry of the tiling is 6-fold.\n\n<<<6-fold rotational symmetry>>>"
