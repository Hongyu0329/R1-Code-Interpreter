    "This is a multi-step organic synthesis problem. We need to identify the structure and name of each intermediate to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Formation of Intermediate-1**\n\n*   **Reactants:** Benzene and propanoyl chloride.\n*   **Reagents:** AlCl₃ (Aluminum chloride), a Lewis acid.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a classic **Friedel-Crafts acylation** reaction.\n*   **Mechanism:** The AlCl₃ activates the propanoyl chloride to form an electrophilic acylium ion ([CH₃CH₂C=O]⁺). The nucleophilic benzene ring attacks this electrophile in an electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) reaction.\n*   **Intermediate-1:** The product is 1-phenylpropan-1-one, also known as propiophenone.\n    *   Structure: A benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group, which is in turn attached to an ethyl group (C₆H₅COCH₂CH₃).\n\n**Step 2: Formation of Intermediate-2**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-1 (1-phenylpropan-1-one).\n*   **Reagents:** Br₂/FeBr₃.\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is an **electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination)** on the substituted benzene ring.\n*   **Analysis of Directing Effects:** The substituent on the ring is an acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃). The carbonyl group is electron-withdrawing and acts as a **deactivator and a meta-director**. Therefore, the incoming bromine atom will be directed to the meta-position (position 3) relative to the acyl group.\n*   **Intermediate-2:** The product is 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n    *   Structure: A propiophenone molecule with a bromine atom at the meta position on the phenyl ring.\n\n**Step 3: Formation of Intermediate-3**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-2 (1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one).\n*   **Reagents:** H₂/Pd (Catalytic Hydrogenation).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a **reduction** reaction.\n*   **Analysis of Selectivity:** H₂ gas with a palladium catalyst is a common reagent for the reduction of ketones to secondary alcohols. Under these mild conditions, the aromatic ring and the aryl-halide bond (C-Br) are not reduced.\n*   **Intermediate-3:** The ketone's carbonyl group (C=O) is reduced to a secondary alcohol group (-CH(OH)-). The product is 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-ol.\n    *   Structure: The C=O group of Intermediate-2 is converted to a CH-OH group.\n\n**Step 4: Formation of the Final Product**\n\n*   **Reactant:** Intermediate-3 (1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-ol).\n*   **Reagents:** NBS (N-Bromosuccinimide), (PhCO₂)₂ (benzoyl peroxide, a radical initiator), and CCl₄ (solvent).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This set of reagents is specific for **free-radical bromination at a benzylic position**.\n*   **Analysis of Reactivity:** The benzylic position is the carbon atom directly attached to the benzene ring. In Intermediate-3, this is the carbon atom that also bears the hydroxyl group (the C1 of the propyl chain). This position is highly susceptible to radical halogenation because the resulting benzylic radical is resonance-stabilized by the aromatic ring. The hydrogen atom on this benzylic carbon will be replaced by a bromine atom.\n*   **Final Product:** Starting from 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-ol, the benzylic hydrogen is substituted with bromine. The final product is **1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-ol**.\n    *   Structure: A propyl alcohol chain where the carbon at position 1 is bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH), a bromine atom (-Br), an ethyl group (-CH₂CH₃), and a 3-bromophenyl group.\n\n<<<1-bromo-1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-ol>>>"
