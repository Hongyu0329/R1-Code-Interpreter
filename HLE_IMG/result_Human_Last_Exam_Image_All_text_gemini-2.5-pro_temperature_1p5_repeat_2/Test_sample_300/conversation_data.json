    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each artwork to determine its author.\n\n**1. Artwork in the Top-Left Corner:**\n*   **Subject:** Three women dressed in the traditional attire of an ethnic minority group. The distinctive flat, layered headdress points towards the Yi people of Southwest China.\n*   **Style:** This is a Chinese figure painting using ink and color on paper (设色纸本). The artist employs a realistic and detailed technique (工笔, gongbi), especially in the rendering of the faces and intricate patterns of the clothing, while also incorporating expressive ink wash for the cloaks.\n*   **Signature/Seal:** A signature and a red seal are visible in the upper right.\n*   **Analysis:** The subject matter and the specific style of blending meticulous detail with atmospheric ink wash are characteristic of **Chen Yuzhong (陈玉众)**, an artist renowned for his paintings of Yi people. This specific work is likely his \"Songs of the Yi People\" (彝乡之歌) or a similar piece from the same series.\n\n**2. Artwork in the Top-Middle Corner:**\n*   **Subject:** A landscape featuring houses nestled among trees.\n*   **Style:** The style is abstract, using strong black ink lines to outline the forms of the houses and expressive, calligraphic strokes for the foliage. This method of deconstructing and reassembling a landscape into geometric lines and shapes is a hallmark of the artist.\n*   **Analysis:** This style, which synthesizes traditional Chinese aesthetics with Western modernism, is the unmistakable signature of **Wu Guanzhong (吴冠中)**. He frequently painted Jiangnan (south of the Yangtze River) water towns and rural landscapes in this manner.\n\n**3. Artwork in the Top-Right Corner:**\n*   **Subject:** A work of Chinese calligraphy.\n*   **Style:** It is written in a very dynamic and fluid Cursive Script (草书, caoshu). The brushwork is powerful and energetic, with significant variation in ink tone (wet vs. dry) and speed.\n*   **Signature/Seal:** Red seals are visible. The overall style is highly recognizable.\n*   **Analysis:** This powerful and expressive calligraphic style is characteristic of **Shen Peng (沈鹏)**, one of the most celebrated contemporary calligraphers in China, known for his mastery of cursive and running scripts.\n\n**4. Artwork in the Middle-Left Corner:**\n*   **Subject:** Another piece of Chinese calligraphy.\n*   **Style:** This is executed in Running-Cursive Script (行草书, xingcaoshu). The characters are elegant, well-structured, and possess a scholarly grace. The artist's unique character structure, often described as slender and internally taut, is famous.\n*   **Signature/Seal:** The signature \"启功\" (Qi Gong) is visible on the far left.\n*   **Analysis:** The distinctive \"Qi style\" (启体) makes this work immediately identifiable as being by **Qi Gong (启功)**, a preeminent 20th-century artist, calligrapher, and connoisseur.\n\n**5. Artwork in the Middle-Center:**\n*   **Subject:** A highly realistic portrait of a young woman with short hair in a white t-shirt, holding a paintbrush and notepad.\n*   **Style:** This is an oil painting on canvas. The style is a form of Neoclassicism, displaying exceptional skill in capturing realism, light, and personality, influenced by European academic portraiture.\n*   **Analysis:** This is one of the most famous and influential works of contemporary Chinese oil painting, titled \"Youth\" (青春). Its author is the renowned master of realistic painting, **Jin Shangyi (靳尚谊)**.\n\n**6. Artwork in the Middle-Right Corner:**\n*   **Subject:** A stylized portrait of a woman in traditional costume with a large headdress, surrounded by birds (sparrows) and foliage.\n*   **Style:** This painting combines Chinese ink with bold colors. The figure is defined by strong outlines, and the composition has a flat, decorative quality, blending Eastern and Western artistic sensibilities (specifically, influences of Fauvism and Expressionism).\n*   **Analysis:** The elongated features, the use of white pigment for outlining, and the overall lyrical and modern interpretation of a classical theme are trademarks of **Lin Fengmian (林风眠)**, a key pioneer of modern Chinese art.\n\n**7. Artwork in the Bottom-Left Corner:**\n*   **Subject:** A rustic courtyard scene, with loofah gourds hanging from a trellis, laundry on a line, and chickens in a basket.\n*   **Style:** This work uses heavy, bright colors and simplified, geometric forms to create a vibrant and rhythmic composition. The focus is on the interplay of color blocks and patterns rather than realistic detail. The signature \"吴冠中\" is visible on the right.\n*   **Analysis:** This style, celebrating the beauty of form and color in everyday rural life, is another facet of **Wu Guanzhong's (吴冠中)** artistic exploration. He is the author of this painting as well as the one in the top-middle.\n\n**8. Artwork in the Bottom-Middle Corner:**\n*   **Subject:** A grand landscape depicting a river gorge (reminiscent of the Yangtze's Three Gorges) with cliffs shrouded in mist and a fleet of boats with red sails.\n*   **Style:** This is a monumental ink and color landscape (山水画). The artist builds up the mountain forms with dense, layered ink washes and textured brushstrokes to create a profound sense of mass, depth, and light.\n*   **Analysis:** This powerful and dramatic landscape style, often featuring iconic Chinese scenery, is the signature of **Li Keran (李可染)**, a master of 20th-century Chinese landscape painting.\n\n**9. Artwork in the Bottom-Right Corner:**\n*   **Subject:** A single spiny lobster.\n*   **Style:** This ink wash painting is executed with remarkable simplicity and vitality. A few deft, wet brushstrokes capture the segmented body, while finer lines depict the legs and long antennae, imbuing the creature with a sense of life and movement. A red seal is in the top-right.\n*   **Analysis:** The mastery of the brush to capture the \"spirit resonance\" (气韵生动) of small creatures, especially shrimp and crustaceans, is the most celebrated achievement of **Qi Baishi (齐白石)**, one of the world's most famous modern artists.\n\nBased on the analysis, the authors of the nine works from left to right, top to bottom are:\n\n1.  Chen Yuzhong\n2.  Wu Guanzhong\n3.  Shen Peng\n4.  Qi Gong\n5.  Jin Shangyi\n6.  Lin Fengmian\n7.  Wu Guanzhong\n8.  Li Keran\n9.  Qi Baishi\n\n<<<Chen Yuzhong, Wu Guanzhong, Shen Peng, Qi Gong, Jin Shangyi, Lin Fengmian, Wu Guanzhong, Li Keran, Qi Baishi>>>"
