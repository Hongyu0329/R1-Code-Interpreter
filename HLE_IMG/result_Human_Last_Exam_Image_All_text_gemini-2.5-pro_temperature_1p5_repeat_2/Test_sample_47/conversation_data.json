    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the value of the current I.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the circuit diagram and identify the topology.**\n\nFirst, we need to correctly interpret the circuit diagram. The circuit consists of a 41 V DC source and five resistors. Let's identify the nodes (junctions) and how the components are connected.\n*   Let's label the horizontal wires (nodes) from top to bottom.\n    *   **Node 1:** The top wire, connected to the positive terminal of the source. The potential is V₁ = 41 V.\n    *   **Node 2:** The second wire from the top. Let's call its potential V₂.\n    *   **Node 3:** The third wire from the top. Let's call its potential V₃. The current `I` is indicated to be flowing in this wire.\n    *   **Node 4:** The bottom wire, connected to the negative terminal and ground. The potential is V₄ = 0 V.\n\n*   Now, let's identify the connections of the resistors based on a careful examination of the diagram and its crops:\n    *   Resistor R₁ = 76 Ω is connected between Node 1 and Node 2.\n    *   Resistor R₂ = 8 Ω is connected between Node 2 and Node 3.\n    *   Resistor R₃ = 14 Ω is connected between Node 2 and Node 3.\n    *   Resistor R₄ = 11 Ω is connected between Node 2 and Node 4 (ground).\n    *   Resistor R₅ = 29 Ω is connected between Node 3 and Node 4 (ground).\n\n*   The resistors R₂ and R₃ are in parallel, as they are both connected between Node 2 and Node 3. Let's calculate their equivalent resistance:\n    *   R₂₃ = (R₂ * R₃) / (R₂ + R₃) = (8 * 14) / (8 + 14) = 112 / 22 = 56/11 Ω.\n\n*   The current `I` is shown flowing along the wire of Node 3, towards the 29 Ω resistor. This means `I` is the current that passes through the 29 Ω resistor (R₅). Therefore, our goal is to find the current I = I(R₅) = V₃ / R₅.\n\n**Step 2: Choose a suitable analysis method.**\n\nThis circuit is not a simple series-parallel combination. It can be solved using nodal analysis (solving for V₂ and V₃) or mesh analysis. Mesh analysis appears to be slightly more straightforward in this case.\n\n**Step 3: Apply Mesh Analysis.**\n\nLet's define two clockwise mesh currents:\n*   **Mesh A (Left Loop):** The loop goes from Node 1 -> Node 2 -> Node 4 -> Node 1. Let the current be I_A.\n*   **Mesh B (Right Loop):** The loop goes from Node 2 -> Node 3 -> Node 4 -> Node 2. Let the current be I_B.\n\nNow, we apply Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) to each mesh.\n\n*   **KVL for Mesh A:**\n    Starting from the voltage source and going clockwise:\n    +41 V - V(R₁) - V(R₄) = 0\n    The current through R₁ (76 Ω) is I_A.\n    The current through R₄ (11 Ω) is (I_A - I_B), as I_B flows in the opposite direction through this shared resistor.\n    So, 41 - 76 * I_A - 11 * (I_A - I_B) = 0\n    41 - 76*I_A - 11*I_A + 11*I_B = 0\n    87*I_A - 11*I_B = 41  --- (Equation 1)\n\n*   **KVL for Mesh B:**\n    Starting from Node 2 and going clockwise:\n    - V(R₂₃) - V(R₅) - V(R₄) = 0\n    The current through the parallel combination R₂₃ (56/11 Ω) is I_B.\n    The current through R₅ (29 Ω) is I_B.\n    The current through R₄ (11 Ω) is (I_B - I_A).\n    So, - (56/11)*I_B - 29*I_B - 11*(I_B - I_A) = 0\n    - (56/11)*I_B - 29*I_B - 11*I_B + 11*I_A = 0\n    11*I_A - (56/11 + 29 + 11)*I_B = 0\n    11*I_A - (56/11 + 40)*I_B = 0\n    11*I_A - ( (56 + 440)/11 )*I_B = 0\n    11*I_A - (496/11)*I_B = 0\n    Multiply by 11: 121*I_A - 496*I_B = 0\n    I_A = (496/121)*I_B --- (Equation 2)\n\n**Step 4: Solve the system of linear equations.**\n\nNow we substitute the expression for I_A from Equation 2 into Equation 1.\n87 * ( (496/121)*I_B ) - 11*I_B = 41\nI_B * ( (87 * 496 / 121) - 11 ) = 41\nI_B * ( (43152 / 121) - (11 * 121 / 121) ) = 41\nI_B * ( (43152 - 1331) / 121 ) = 41\nI_B * (41821 / 121) = 41\nI_B = 41 * 121 / 41821\nI_B = 4961 / 41821\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final answer.**\n\nThe target current `I` is the current flowing through the 29 Ω resistor (R₅).\nIn our mesh current setup, the current flowing through R₅ is I_B.\nTherefore, I = I_B.\nI = 4961 / 41821 A.\n\nTo get a numerical value, we perform the division:\nI ≈ 0.118629 A\n\nRounding to three significant figures, we get:\nI ≈ 0.119 A\n\nLet's verify the factors to ensure the fraction is in simplest form.\n4961 = 41 * 121 = 41 * 11².\n41821 is not divisible by 11 (since 4-1+8-2+1=10) or 41 (since 41821 = 41*1020 + 1).\nSo the fraction is irreducible.\n\nFinal answer is I = 4961 / 41821 A.\n\n<<<0.119>>>"
