    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the opera from the provided sheet music.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Language and Instrumentation:**\n    *   The instrument names and performance directions are in German. We see \"2 gr. Fl.\" (2 große Flöten - 2 flutes), \"I. Hob.\" (Erste Oboe - 1st Oboe), \"engl. Horn\" (English Horn), \"I. Fag.\" (Erstes Fagott - 1st Bassoon), \"I. Viol.\" (Erste Violine - 1st Violin), \"Br.\" (Bratsche - Viola), and \"Celli\" (Violoncelli).\n    *   Other instructions are also in German: \"(Vorhang)\" means \"(Curtain)\", \"(mit Dämpfer)\" means \"(with mute)\", and \"(die übrigen)\" means \"(the rest)\".\n    *   This strongly indicates the composer is German or Austrian.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Musical Style:**\n    *   **Harmony:** The score is highly chromatic, filled with accidentals (sharps, flats, and naturals) despite having no key signature. This harmonic language is characteristic of the late-Romantic period, particularly the works of composers like Richard Wagner and Richard Strauss.\n    *   **Orchestration:** The orchestration is very rich and detailed. The string section is heavily divided into multiple parts (\"1. Pult\", \"2. Pult\", \"Solo\", \"die übrigen\"). This extensive division is a hallmark of late-Romantic composers who sought a wide palette of orchestral colors. The use of mutes (\"mit Dämpfer\") further refines the sonic texture, creating a subdued and mysterious atmosphere.\n\n3.  **Identify Key Musical Motifs and Context:**\n    *   The question states this is the opening of the *second act* of an opera. The instruction \"(Vorhang)\" confirms that the curtain is intended to rise shortly after the music begins.\n    *   There is a very prominent and distinctive theme played by the \"Solo Br.\" (Solo Viola). This rising, chromatic, and somewhat sinister-sounding theme is a leitmotif.\n    *   The initial passage in the first violins is frantic and descending, setting a turbulent mood.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Clues and Identify the Opera:**\n    *   The combination of a late-Romantic German opera, a highly detailed and specific orchestration, intense chromaticism, and a very famous leitmotif points strongly towards Richard Wagner.\n    *   Checking the works of Wagner, the opening of Act II of his final opera, *Parsifal*, begins with a turbulent orchestral prelude.\n    *   This prelude depicts the magic castle of the evil sorcerer, Klingsor. The theme played by the solo viola in the score is, in fact, the well-known \"Klingsor\" leitmotif.\n    *   A direct comparison of the provided score with the beginning of Act II of *Parsifal* confirms a perfect match in instrumentation, melodic content, harmony, and German performance instructions.\n\nTherefore, the sheet music is the beginning of the prelude to Act II of the opera *Parsifal*.\n\n<<<Parsifal>>>"
