The regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is due to the conformational rigidity of the cyclic N-acetylproline starting material. This rigidity leads to a single, well-defined MÃ¼nchnone intermediate that reacts with high selectivity. In contrast, the flexible, acyclic starting material in Reactions 1 and 2 allows for a scrambling mechanism that equilibrates the reactive groups, as shown by the isotopic labeling results. This scrambling is not possible for the rigid proline derivative, hence its high regioselectivity.
