The four possibilities for describing the reaction in terms of [mπ+nπ] are:
1.  **[6π + 4π] cycloaddition:** One molecule acts as a 6π component and the other acts as a 4π component.
2.  **[8π + 2π] cycloaddition:** One molecule acts as an 8π component and the other acts as a 2π component.
3.  **[4π + 4π] cycloaddition:** Both molecules act as 4π components.
4.  **A tandem sequence of two [4π + 2π] cycloadditions:** An initial intermolecular [4π + 2π] reaction followed by an intramolecular [4π + 2π] reaction.
