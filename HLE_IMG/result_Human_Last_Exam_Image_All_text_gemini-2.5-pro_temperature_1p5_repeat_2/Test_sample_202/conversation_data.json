    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each rock specimen:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Specimen H**\n*   **Observations:** This specimen is reddish-brown and has a very porous, spongy appearance. It is covered in numerous small holes called vesicles. This texture indicates that it formed from a lava that was full of gas bubbles which escaped as the rock cooled and solidified. The overall grain size is very fine (aphanitic), meaning individual crystals are not visible to the naked eye.\n*   **Careful Points:** The key features are the vesicular (holey) texture and the reddish color. The color suggests a composition rich in iron that has been oxidized (rusted). This type of rock is extrusive, meaning it cooled quickly on the Earth's surface from lava.\n*   **Identification:** Based on the high vesicularity, fine-grained texture, and reddish color, this rock is identified as **Scoria**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Specimen I**\n*   **Observations:** This rock is composed of various smaller, angular pieces (clasts) of different colors (gray, white, reddish) that are cemented together in a fine-grained, light-gray matrix. This is known as a pyroclastic or fragmental texture.\n*   **Careful Points:** The rock is not made of interlocking crystals but rather of fragments of other rocks and ash. The angular shape of the fragments suggests they were not transported far before being deposited. This type of rock is formed from the material ejected during a volcanic eruption.\n*   **Identification:** A rock made of consolidated volcanic ash and larger angular fragments (called lapilli) is known as **Tuff** (specifically, a lapilli tuff). A volcanic breccia would typically have larger fragments. Tuff is the most fitting identification.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Specimen J**\n*   **Observations:** This specimen is light-colored (white to light gray) and, like specimen H, is highly vesicular. The vesicles are abundant, making the rock look frothy and lightweight. The grain size is aphanitic (fine-grained).\n*   **Careful Points:** The key characteristics are the light color, the extremely high vesicularity, and the fine-grained texture. Light-colored igneous rocks are typically felsic (rich in silica). The frothy texture is due to a very rapid cooling of a gas-rich, viscous lava.\n*   **Identification:** The combination of these features is characteristic of **Pumice**. Pumice is notable for being so low in density due to the vesicles that it can often float on water.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Specimen K**\n*   **Observations:** This specimen is composed of large, interlocking crystals that are clearly visible to the naked eye. This is a coarse-grained (phaneritic) texture. We can distinguish several different minerals based on color: glassy gray crystals, whitish to pinkish crystals, and dark, flaky or blocky crystals.\n*   **Careful Points:** The coarse-grained, crystalline texture indicates the rock cooled slowly, deep beneath the Earth's surface (an intrusive igneous rock). The mineral composition can be inferred from the colors: the gray, glassy mineral is quartz; the white/pinkish mineral is feldspar; and the dark minerals are likely biotite mica and/or hornblende.\n*   **Identification:** An intrusive, coarse-grained igneous rock containing quartz and feldspar as its main components is identified as **Granite**.\n\n**Summary of Identifications:**\n*   H: Scoria\n*   I: Tuff\n*   J: Pumice\n*   K: Granite\n\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Tuff, J: Pumice, K: Granite>>>"
