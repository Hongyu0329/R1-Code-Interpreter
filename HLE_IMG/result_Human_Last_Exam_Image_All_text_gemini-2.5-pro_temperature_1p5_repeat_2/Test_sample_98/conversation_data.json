    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the visual style of the medallion.** The medallion depicts two busts facing each other. The style is highly stylized and not naturalistic, which distinguishes it from classical Roman or Greek art. The hair of the figures is rendered in a very decorative, patterned manner, with repeating curved locks. The eyes are large and almond-shaped. This abstract and ornamental approach to portraiture is characteristic of a post-Roman, early medieval artistic tradition.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the cultural and historical context.** This artistic style is strongly associated with the art of the Germanic peoples who established kingdoms in Europe after the decline of the Western Roman Empire. Specifically, it aligns with Merovingian art, which flourished in the Frankish kingdoms (modern-day France and parts of Germany) from the 5th to the 8th century. The combination of late Roman forms (like the portrait medallion) with Germanic decorative motifs is a key feature of this period.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify the specific artifact.** This is a well-known archaeological find. It is the \"Medallion of Saint-Leu-d'Esserent,\" discovered in a tomb in the Oise department of France. It is considered a masterpiece of Merovingian goldsmithing.\n\n*   **Step 4: Determine the archaeological dating.** Art historians and archaeologists have extensively studied the medallion and its context. Based on stylistic comparisons with other dated Merovingian objects (such as illuminated manuscripts, fibulae, and buckles) and the archaeological context of the tomb where it was found, the medallion is consistently dated to the middle of the 7th century AD. The figures are sometimes tentatively identified as the Merovingian king Dagobert I (d. 639) and his queen Nanthild, which aligns with this dating.\n\n*   **Step 5: Conclude the century.** Since the medallion is dated to the mid-600s AD, it belongs to the 7th century AD.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Pay close attention to the artistic style. The departure from classical naturalism is the primary clue.\n*   Recognize the patterned, almost geometric treatment of the hair, which is a hallmark of Merovingian and other \"barbarian\" art of the period.\n*   Understand that dating is based on stylistic comparison and archaeological context, not an inscription on the object itself.\n*   The format \"7th century AD\" correctly identifies the period from 601 AD to 700 AD.\n\n<<<7th century AD>>>"
