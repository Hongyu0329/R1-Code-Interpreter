    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Starting Material:**\n    *   The starting material is a bicyclic organic molecule. Based on common organic structures, this appears to be a derivative of a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one, also known as a Vince lactam.\n    *   The structure has the following features:\n        *   A bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene core with a nitrogen atom at position 2 and a carbonyl group at position 3, forming a lactam (cyclic amide).\n        *   A double bond is present between positions C5 and C6.\n        *   A trifluoromethyl group (CF3) is attached to C6.\n        *   The nitrogen atom is protected by a PMB (para-methoxybenzyl) group.\n    *   Let's determine its molecular formula:\n        *   Core skeleton (2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one): C6H5NO.\n        *   CF3 group: CF3.\n        *   PMB group (-CH2-C6H4-OCH3): C8H9O.\n        *   Adding these parts together, we start with the core C6H5NO. We substitute a hydrogen on the C=C with a CF3 group, so we replace one H with CF3. This gives C6H4F3NO for the substituted core. Then we substitute the hydrogen on the nitrogen with the PMB group (C8H9O), which means removing one H and adding C8H9O.\n        *   Total Formula: C(6+1(from CF3)+8) H(5(from core)-1(H on N)-1(H on C6)+9) F3 N O(1(from C=O)+1(from PMB)) = C15H12F3NO2. Let's re-calculate by counting atoms on the presumed structure (2-(p-methoxybenzyl)-6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one):\n            *   Carbons: 6 (in the bicyclic core) + 1 (in CF3) + 8 (in PMB) = 15 C.\n            *   Hydrogens: 1 (at C1) + 1 (at C4) + 1 (at C5) + 2 (at C7) + 9 (in PMB) = 14 H.\n            *   Fluorines: 3 F.\n            *   Nitrogens: 1 N.\n            *   Oxygens: 1 (in carbonyl) + 1 (in PMB ether) = 2 O.\n        *   The molecular formula of the starting material is **C15H14F3NO2**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the first reaction: Formation of Intermediate 1**\n    *   Reagents: CAN (Ceric Ammonium Nitrate) in ACN/H2O.\n    *   Reaction Type: Oxidative deprotection. CAN is a specific reagent used to remove electron-rich protecting groups like PMB from amines and alcohols.\n    *   Transformation: The PMB group (-C8H9O) is cleaved from the nitrogen atom, and a hydrogen atom is added in its place.\n    *   Change in formula: Subtract the PMB group (C8H9O) and add one H. Net change is -C8H8O.\n    *   Formula of Intermediate 1: C15H14F3NO2 - C8H8O = **C7H6F3NO**.\n    *   Structure of Intermediate 1: 6-(Trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n\n3.  **Analyze the second reaction: Formation of Intermediate 2**\n    *   Reagents: Pd/C, H2 (Palladium on carbon with hydrogen gas) in MeOH (methanol).\n    *   Reaction Type: Catalytic hydrogenation.\n    *   Transformation: This reaction reduces carbon-carbon double bonds. The C5=C6 double bond in the bicyclic system will be reduced to a single bond by the addition of two hydrogen atoms (H2). Other functional groups like the lactam (amide) are stable under these conditions.\n    *   Change in formula: Add H2.\n    *   Formula of Intermediate 2: C7H6F3NO + H2 = **C7H8F3NO**.\n    *   Structure of Intermediate 2: 6-(Trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-3-one.\n\n4.  **Analyze the third reaction: Formation of the final Product**\n    *   Reagents: 4 N HCl (hydrochloric acid), 70 Â°C.\n    *   Reaction Type: Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.\n    *   Transformation: The strong acidic and heated conditions will hydrolyze the lactam (cyclic amide). The amide bond (N2-C3) is cleaved. This reaction involves the addition of one molecule of water (H2O). The carbonyl group (C=O) becomes a carboxylic acid (-COOH), and the nitrogen atom becomes an amino group (-NH2). This cleavage opens one of the bridges of the bicyclic system, resulting in a monocyclic (cyclopentane) derivative.\n    *   Change in formula: Add H2O.\n    *   Formula of the final product: C7H8F3NO + H2O = **C7H10F3NO2**.\n    *   Structure of the Product: The product is a substituted cyclopentane containing a carboxylic acid group, an amino group, and a trifluoromethyl group. Specifically, it is a derivative of 4-aminocyclopentane-1-carboxylic acid.\n    *   Careful point: The question asks for the molecular formula. Under the given acidic conditions (4N HCl), the final product would exist as its ammonium salt (R-NH3+ Cl-). However, \"molecular formula\" typically refers to the neutral form of the molecule. The formula of the neutral amino acid is C7H10F3NO2.\n\n**Summary of Formula Changes:**\n*   Starting Material: C15H14F3NO2\n*   Step 1 (Deprotection): -> Intermediate 1 (C7H6F3NO)\n*   Step 2 (Hydrogenation): -> Intermediate 2 (C7H8F3NO)\n*   Step 3 (Hydrolysis): -> Product (**C7H10F3NO2**)\n\nThe final product's molecular formula is C7H10F3NO2.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
