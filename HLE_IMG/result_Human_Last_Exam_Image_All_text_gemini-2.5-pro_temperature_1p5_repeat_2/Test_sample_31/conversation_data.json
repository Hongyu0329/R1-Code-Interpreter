    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Rasmussen invariant of the knot in the picture.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Knot\n1.  **Count the crossings:** First, we examine the knot diagram to determine its crossing number. By carefully counting, we can identify six distinct crossings:\n    *   Three crossings are stacked vertically in the central part of the knot.\n    *   One crossing is on the left side.\n    *   One crossing is on the right side.\n    *   One crossing is at the bottom.\n    This gives a total of 6 crossings.\n\n2.  **Check if the knot is alternating:** An alternating knot is one that has a diagram where the crossings alternate between 'over' and 'under' as one travels along the knot. Let's trace a path along the strand of the knot:\n    *   Start on the strand at the far left, moving upwards. It passes **over** the crossing on the left (let's call it C4).\n    *   Continue along the strand. It goes towards the center and passes **under** the top central crossing (C1).\n    *   It continues downwards, passing **over** the middle central crossing (C2).\n    *   It continues downwards, passing **under** the bottom central crossing (C3).\n    *   The strand then goes towards the right loop and passes **under** the crossing on the right (C5).\n    *   Here we have found two consecutive 'under' crossings (C3 and C5) without an 'over' crossing in between.\n    *   Therefore, this diagram is **not alternating**.\n\n3.  **Identify the specific knot:** The knot has 6 crossings and is non-alternating. In the standard classification of knots (the Rolfsen table), there is only one prime knot with 6 crossings that is non-alternating: the **6₂ knot**. The provided diagram is a common representation of the 6₂ knot.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Rasmussen Invariant (s)\nThe Rasmussen invariant, denoted as `s(K)`, is an integer-valued knot invariant derived from Khovanov homology. For alternating knots, there are simpler formulas to calculate it, but since 6₂ is non-alternating, we cannot use them directly. However, we can use the fundamental properties of the knot and the invariant.\n\n1.  **Recall a key property of the 6₂ knot:** The 6₂ knot is known to be **amphichiral** (or amphicheiral). An amphichiral knot is a knot that is equivalent (isotopic) to its own mirror image. Let's denote the mirror image of a knot K as `mirror(K)`. So, for the 6₂ knot, we have `6₂ ~ mirror(6₂)`.\n\n2.  **Recall a key property of the Rasmussen invariant:** The Rasmussen invariant `s` is a true knot invariant, meaning that if two knots are equivalent, they have the same `s` value. Also, the invariant behaves in a specific way with respect to taking the mirror image: `s(mirror(K)) = -s(K)`.\n\n3.  **Combine these properties to find the answer:**\n    *   Since the 6₂ knot is amphichiral, it is equivalent to its mirror image: `6₂ ~ mirror(6₂)`.\n    *   Because `s` is a knot invariant, equivalent knots must have the same invariant: `s(6₂) = s(mirror(6₂))`.\n    *   Using the property of how the `s` invariant transforms under mirroring, we have: `s(mirror(6₂)) = -s(6₂)`.\n    *   Combining these two equations, we get: `s(6₂) = -s(6₂)`.\n    *   This equation can be rewritten as `2 * s(6₂) = 0`.\n    *   The only integer solution to this equation is `s(6₂) = 0`.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe logical deduction based on the properties of the 6₂ knot and the Rasmussen invariant leads to the result without needing complex computations. The knot is identified as the amphichiral knot 6₂, and for any amphichiral knot, the Rasmussen invariant must be zero.\n\nThe final answer is 0.\n<<<0>>>"
