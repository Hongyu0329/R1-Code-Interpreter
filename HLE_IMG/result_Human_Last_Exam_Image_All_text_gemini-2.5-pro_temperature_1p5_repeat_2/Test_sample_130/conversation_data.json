    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the element from its spectral lines:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Image**\nThe image provided is an **emission spectrum**. This is identifiable by the series of discrete, bright, colored vertical lines against a dark background. Each element, when excited (e.g., by heating or passing an electric current through it), emits light at specific wavelengths. When this light is passed through a prism or diffraction grating, it creates a unique pattern of lines, which acts as a \"fingerprint\" for that element.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Spectral Pattern**\nWe need to carefully observe the colors (which correspond to wavelengths) and the positions of the most prominent lines in the spectrum, moving from right to left (from longer to shorter wavelengths).\n\n*   **Red Region:** On the far right, there is a prominent, bright red line. There are also a few other fainter red lines.\n*   **Yellow-Orange Region:** Moving left, there is a very distinct and bright yellow-orange line. This is one of the most noticeable features of the spectrum.\n*   **Green Region:** There is a bright green line, followed by a slightly less intense cyan (blue-green) line. There appear to be several other fainter lines in this area.\n*   **Blue-Violet Region:** In the blue and violet part of the spectrum on the left, there are several distinct lines, including a strong blue line and a strong violet line.\n\n**Step 3: Compare with Known Spectra of Common Elements**\n\n*   **Hydrogen:** The visible spectrum of hydrogen (the Balmer series) is relatively simple, with four main lines: a red line (H-alpha at 656 nm), a cyan line (H-beta at 486 nm), a blue-violet line (H-gamma at 434 nm), and a violet line (H-delta at 410 nm). The spectrum in the image is much more complex, containing many more lines, especially the bright yellow-orange one, which is absent in hydrogen. Therefore, it is not hydrogen.\n*   **Sodium:** Sodium is famous for its very intense, closely spaced pair of lines in the yellow part of the spectrum (a doublet at ~589 nm). While the image has a yellow line, it also has very strong lines in the red, green, and blue, which are not characteristic of sodium's visible spectrum. Thus, it is not sodium.\n*   **Neon:** Neon is well-known for its use in signs and produces a spectrum dominated by a large number of bright lines in the red and orange regions. The given spectrum has a much more balanced distribution of colors, with strong lines in the green and blue as well. It is not neon.\n*   **Helium:** The emission spectrum for helium is famous and matches the image perfectly. Its prominent visible lines are:\n    *   A bright red line at ~667.8 nm.\n    *   A bright yellow line at ~587.6 nm.\n    *   A bright green line at ~501.6 nm.\n    *   A cyan line at ~492.2 nm.\n    *   A blue-violet line at ~471.3 nm.\n    *   A violet line at ~447.1 nm.\n    This set of lines, in their respective positions and relative brightness, is a definitive fingerprint for Helium. The image provided is a classic representation of the Helium spectrum.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nBased on the comparison, the pattern of spectral lines shown in the image—specifically the prominent red, yellow, green, and blue-violet lines—uniquely corresponds to the element Helium.\n\n<<<Helium>>>"
