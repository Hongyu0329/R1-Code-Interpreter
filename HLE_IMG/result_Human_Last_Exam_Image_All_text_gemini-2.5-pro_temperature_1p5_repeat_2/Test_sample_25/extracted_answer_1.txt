The result should be interpreted as invalid or failed. While the curve technically crosses the threshold before the cut-off cycle, it does not have the characteristic sigmoidal (S-shaped) amplification curve required for a valid positive result. The slow, linear drift suggests the signal is likely due to background noise or non-specific amplification, not true target amplification. Therefore, the result is unreliable and the test should be repeated.
