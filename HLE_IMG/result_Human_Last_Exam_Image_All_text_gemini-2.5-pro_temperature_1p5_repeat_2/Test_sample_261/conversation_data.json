    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to determine the book's title.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual elements in the image fragment.**\nThe image shows a portion of an illustration. The main subject is a unicorn, which appears white or very light blue and has a somewhat ethereal, ghostly, or blurry quality, suggesting it's in motion. It has a prominent golden horn. The unicorn is running through a dark, shadowy area that resembles a forest. To the right, there is a portion of a decorated stone pillar or archway, which is colored in shades of brown and gold. The overall artistic style is illustrative and typical of fantasy fiction.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate a hypothesis based on the elements.**\nThe combination of a unicorn, a dark forest, and a magical fantasy art style points towards a popular fantasy series. The unicorn is a well-known creature in mythology and fantasy literature. A particularly famous scene involving a unicorn in a forest occurs in the Harry Potter series.\n\n**Step 3: Investigate the connection to Harry Potter.**\nIn the first book, *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* (known as *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* in the United States), Harry encounters a unicorn in the Forbidden Forest. This makes it a likely candidate. We need to check the cover art of this book.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the specific cover art.**\nThere are many different editions and covers for the Harry Potter books. The art style in the fragment is very distinctive. It matches the style of Mary GrandPré, the illustrator for the original American editions of the Harry Potter series published by Scholastic.\n\n**Step 5: Verify the fragment's location on the cover.**\nLooking at the full dust jacket illustration for the American edition of *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* by Mary GrandPré, we can confirm the fragment's source. The front cover depicts Harry on his broomstick flying towards the Sorcerer's Stone. The illustration wraps around to the back cover, showing the Forbidden Forest. In the lower left part of the back cover, the very same ghostly unicorn is seen running. The pillar in the fragment is part of the large, ornate archway that frames the entire scene on the book's dust jacket.\n\n**Step 6: State the final answer.**\nBased on the distinctive artwork by Mary GrandPré and the specific scene depicted, the image fragment is from the cover of the American edition of the first Harry Potter book.\n\n<<<Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone>>>"
