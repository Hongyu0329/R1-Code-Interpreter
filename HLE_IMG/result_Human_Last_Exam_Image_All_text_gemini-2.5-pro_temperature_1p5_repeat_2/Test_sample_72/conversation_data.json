    "Step-by-step analysis:\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Conditions**: The reaction starts with hexafluorobenzene (C6F6), an aromatic compound with a 6π-electron system, and cyclobutene (C4H4), an alkene with a 2π-electron system. The reaction is carried out under photochemical conditions (indicated by hν), meaning light provides the energy to initiate the reaction. The problem statement specifies that two photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions occur.\n\n2.  **Analyze Pericyclic Reaction Possibilities**: Pericyclic reactions are concerted reactions that proceed through a cyclic transition state. The main types are cycloadditions, electrocyclic reactions, and sigmatropic rearrangements. Photochemical conditions have specific selection rules (Woodward-Hoffmann rules) that determine which pericyclic reactions are \"allowed\".\n\n3.  **Propose the First Reaction Step**: A common photochemical reaction between an arene (like hexafluorobenzene) and an alkene (like cyclobutene) is a cycloaddition. Specifically, a [2+2] cycloaddition between a π-bond of the benzene ring and the π-bond of the alkene is photochemically allowed. In this case, hexafluorobenzene reacts with cyclobutene in an intermolecular [2+2] cycloaddition.\n    *   **Reaction 1**: C6F6 + C4H4 → [2+2] adduct.\n    *   This reaction forms a four-membered ring, fusing the two molecules. The product is a hexafluoro-bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene. The aromaticity of the hexafluorobenzene is broken, leaving a 1,3-cyclohexadiene ring fused to a cyclobutane ring.\n    *   **Classification of Reaction 1**: This is a **[2+2] cycloaddition**. It is photochemically allowed via a [π2s + π2s] transition state.\n\n4.  **Propose the Second Reaction Step**: The intermediate formed in the first step, hexafluoro-bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene, contains a conjugated 1,3-diene system within its six-membered ring. This 4π-electron system is poised for another pericyclic reaction. Under photochemical conditions, a 4π-electron system can undergo an electrocyclic ring closure.\n    *   **Reaction 2**: Hexafluoro-bicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4,7-triene → Final Product.\n    *   The 4π system of the cyclohexadiene ring undergoes an intramolecular ring closure to form a new σ-bond. This converts the cyclohexadiene moiety into a bicyclo[2.2.0]hexane system, which is a highly strained but known structure. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, a 4π photochemical electrocyclization proceeds in a disrotatory fashion.\n    *   **Classification of Reaction 2**: This is an **electrocyclic reaction**.\n\n5.  **Summary of Reaction Types**: The overall transformation is best described by this sequence of two distinct pericyclic reactions:\n    1.  An intermolecular **[2+2] cycloaddition**.\n    2.  An intramolecular **electrocyclic reaction**.\n\n*Careful Point*: The structure of the final product depicted in the image is chemically inaccurate. It shows a molecule with a degree of unsaturation of 4 (3 rings + 1 double bond), whereas the molecular formula C10H4F6 (from the reactants) requires a degree of unsaturation of 6. The actual product, confirmed by literature, is a tetracyclic diene, which has the correct degree of unsaturation (4 rings + 2 double bonds = 6). Despite the incorrect drawing, the question asks to identify the types of reactions, and the pathway described above is the established mechanism for this transformation.\n\nAnother plausible, but less likely, pathway involves the initial photoisomerization of hexafluorobenzene to Dewar-hexafluorobenzene (an intramolecular [2+2] cycloaddition or a 6π electrocyclic reaction), followed by a [2+2] cycloaddition with cyclobutene. However, the reaction between arenes and alkenes typically proceeds via initial intermolecular addition. The combination of a cycloaddition and an electrocyclic reaction represents two distinct classes of pericyclic reactions.\n\nTherefore, the two types of pericyclic reactions are a [2+2] cycloaddition and an electrocyclic reaction.\n\n<<<[2+2] cycloaddition and electrocyclic reaction>>>"
