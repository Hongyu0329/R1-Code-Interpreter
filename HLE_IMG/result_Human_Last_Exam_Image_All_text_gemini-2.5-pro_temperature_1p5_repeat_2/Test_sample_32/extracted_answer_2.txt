The main difference in the sporophyte is the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, causing the capsule to be immersed among the leaves and stand erect. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* has a longer, distinctly curved (arcuate) seta, which makes the capsule exserted (held above the leaves) and cernuous (nodding).
