    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to distinguish the sporophytes of *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Question**\nThe question asks for the primary, easily observable difference in the sporophyte generation of two specific moss species, *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta*. The term \"at a glance\" implies a macroscopic feature that does not require microscopic examination.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Parts of a Moss Sporophyte**\nA typical moss sporophyte consists of three main parts:\n1.  **Foot:** Anchors the sporophyte to the gametophyte.\n2.  **Seta:** The stalk that elevates the capsule. Its length and shape can be important diagnostic features.\n3.  **Capsule:** The structure at the tip of the seta that produces and releases spores. Its shape, orientation, and position relative to the leaves are key characters.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Sporophyte of *Grimmia montana***\n*   **Seta:** The seta of *Grimmia montana* is very short and, crucially, **straight**.\n*   **Capsule Position:** Because the seta is short and straight, the capsule is **immersed** within the perichaetial leaves (the specialized leaves surrounding the base of the sporophyte) or, at most, barely emergent.\n*   **Capsule Orientation:** The capsule is held **erect**.\n*   The image provided, showing immersed, erect capsules, is characteristic of *Grimmia montana*.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Sporophyte of *Grimmia curviseta***\n*   **Seta:** The name *curviseta* itself provides the main clue: \"curvi\" (curved) + \"seta\" (stalk). The seta of this species is longer than that of *G. montana* and is distinctly **curved or arcuate** (bent in an arch).\n*   **Capsule Position:** Due to the longer, curved seta, the capsule is **exserted**, meaning it is held well above the surrounding leaves.\n*   **Capsule Orientation:** The curve in the seta causes the capsule to be **cernuous** (nodding or drooping).\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the Main Difference**\nBy comparing the two species, the most significant and immediately obvious difference in their sporophytes is the **seta**.\n\n*   ***Grimmia montana*** has a **short, straight seta**, resulting in an **immersed, erect capsule**.\n*   ***Grimmia curviseta*** has a **longer, curved seta**, resulting in an **exserted, nodding capsule**.\n\nThis difference in the length and curvature of the seta, and the resulting position and orientation of the capsule, is the key feature to distinguish the two species \"at a glance\" when they are fertile.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   The distinction relies on the presence of mature sporophytes. Without them, identifying the species based on gametophyte characteristics can be more challenging.\n*   The state of hydration can affect the appearance. The curvature of the seta in *Grimmia curviseta* is often most pronounced when moist. When dry, it may straighten somewhat but usually retains a curve.\n*   The question specifically asks about the sporophyte, so differences in the leaves (gametophyte) are not the primary answer, although they also exist. The sporophytic difference is more striking.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe main difference is the morphology of the seta (the stalk).\n\n<<<The main difference in the sporophyte is the seta (the stalk supporting the capsule). In *Grimmia montana*, the seta is short and straight, causing the capsule to be immersed among the leaves and stand erect. In contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* has a longer, distinctly curved (arcuate) seta, which makes the capsule exserted (held above the leaves) and cernuous (nodding)."
