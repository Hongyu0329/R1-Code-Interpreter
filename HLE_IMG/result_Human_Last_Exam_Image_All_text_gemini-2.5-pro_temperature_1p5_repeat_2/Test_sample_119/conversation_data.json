    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**1. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis:**\n*   The mass spectrum shows the molecular ion peak (M⁺) at m/z = 135.\n*   An odd molecular weight suggests the presence of an odd number of nitrogen atoms (Nitrogen Rule). We'll assume one nitrogen atom.\n*   From the NMR data (see below), we can identify a monosubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₅-), which has a mass of 77.\n*   The remaining mass is 135 - 77 = 58.\n*   This remaining fragment must contain one nitrogen (mass 14) and C/H atoms with a combined mass of 58 - 14 = 44.\n*   A combination of C and H that sums to 44 is C₃H₈ (3*12 + 8*1 = 44).\n*   Therefore, a plausible molecular formula is C₆H₅ + C₃H₈N = **C₉H₁₃N**.\n*   Let's verify the mass: (9 * 12) + (13 * 1) + 14 = 108 + 13 + 14 = 135. This matches the M⁺ peak.\n*   The Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) for C₉H₁₃N is: DBE = C + 1 - H/2 + N/2 = 9 + 1 - 13/2 + 1/2 = 10 - 6.5 + 0.5 = 4. A benzene ring accounts for 4 DBEs, so the side chain must be saturated.\n\n**2. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy Analysis:**\n*   Peaks just above 3000 cm⁻¹ are due to aromatic C-H stretching.\n*   Strong peaks just below 3000 cm⁻¹ are due to aliphatic C-H stretching.\n*   Peaks around 1600 cm⁻¹ and 1450-1500 cm⁻¹ correspond to C=C stretching within an aromatic ring.\n*   Strong peaks in the 690-770 cm⁻¹ range are characteristic of out-of-plane C-H bending for a monosubstituted benzene ring.\n*   There are weak, broad signals around 3300-3400 cm⁻¹, suggestive of an N-H bond, likely from a primary or secondary amine. The absence of a carbonyl (C=O) peak (~1700 cm⁻¹) rules out an amide.\n\n**3. ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Analysis:**\n*   **¹³C NMR signals:** δ 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2. There are 7 unique carbon signals. Since the formula is C₉H₁₃N, some carbons must be chemically equivalent.\n*   **Aromatic region (δ > 100 ppm):**\n    *   Four signals: 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3. This pattern is characteristic of a monosubstituted benzene ring, where the ortho and meta carbons are equivalent, resulting in 4 signals (ipso, ortho, meta, para).\n*   **DEPT-135 Analysis:**\n    *   There is one negative signal, indicating one **CH₂** group.\n    *   There are five positive signals, indicating five **CH** or **CH₃** groups.\n    *   Quaternary carbons (like the ipso-carbon) are invisible in DEPT-135. The signal at δ 145.1 is the only one not accounted for in DEPT-135, so it must be the **quaternary ipso-carbon**.\n    *   Of the five positive signals, we can assign three to the aromatic CH groups (δ 128.5, 127.3, 126.3).\n    *   This leaves two positive signals and one negative signal for the three aliphatic carbons (δ 49.6, 43.5, 19.2).\n    *   The signal at δ 19.2 is typical for a **CH₃** group (positive in DEPT).\n    *   The remaining two signals (δ 49.6, 43.5) must correspond to one **CH** group (positive) and one **CH₂** group (negative).\n*   **Carbon skeleton summary:** The molecule contains a monosubstituted phenyl group attached to a three-carbon chain. The three carbons of the chain are unique and consist of one CH₃, one CH₂, and one CH group. This corresponds to a Ph-CH₂-CH-CH₃ backbone.\n\n**4. ¹H NMR and HSQC Analysis:**\n*   **¹H NMR signals:**\n    *   **δ ~7.2 ppm (multiplet, 5H):** Aromatic protons of a monosubstituted benzene ring (C₆H₅-).\n    *   **δ ~2.8 ppm (complex multiplet, ~2H):** Aliphatic protons.\n    *   **δ ~2.6 ppm (broad singlet, ~1H):** Exchangeable proton, characteristic of an N-H group in a secondary amine or one proton of a primary amine under certain conditions.\n    *   **δ ~1.2 ppm (doublet, ~3H):** Suggests a CH₃ group adjacent to a single proton (a CH group).\n*   **HSQC (connects ¹H to their attached ¹³C):**\n    *   The aromatic protons (~7.2 ppm) correlate with the aromatic carbons (126-129 ppm).\n    *   The protons in the multiplet around **~2.8 ppm** correlate with the carbon at **δ 43.5**. This is the **CH₂** group. The chemical shift is consistent with a benzylic methylene group (Ph-CH₂-).\n    *   A proton signal, likely buried in the multiplet near 3.0 ppm, correlates with the carbon at **δ 49.6**. This is the **CH** group.\n    *   The doublet protons at **~1.2 ppm** correlate with the carbon at **δ 19.2**. This confirms the **CH₃** group.\n*   **Piecing it together:** The HSQC confirms the Ph-CH₂-CH-CH₃ backbone.\n    *   Ph-CH₂ group: Protons at ~2.8 ppm, carbon at 43.5 ppm.\n    *   -CH- group: Proton at ~3.0 ppm, carbon at 49.6 ppm.\n    *   -CH₃ group: Protons at ~1.2 ppm, carbon at 19.2 ppm.\n    *   The amine group (-NH₂) must be attached to the CH carbon to satisfy valency.\n\n**5. Final Structure and IUPAC Name:**\n*   The deduced structure is: Phenyl-CH₂-CH(NH₂)-CH₃.\n*   This is commonly known as amphetamine.\n*   To find the IUPAC name, we identify the longest carbon chain containing the principal functional group (the amine).\n*   The parent chain is a three-carbon chain (propane).\n*   Number the chain to give the amine group the lowest possible number:\n    `Phenyl - C1 - C2(NH₂) - C3(H₃)`\n*   The parent name is **propan-2-amine**.\n*   A phenyl group is a substituent on carbon 1.\n*   The full IUPAC name is **1-phenylpropan-2-amine**.\n\n<<<1-phenylpropan-2-amine>>>"
