    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided sheet music to identify the piece:\n\n1.  **Initial Observations**:\n    *   **Instrumentation**: The piece is for solo piano, as indicated by the grand staff (treble and bass clefs joined by a brace).\n    *   **Tempo**: The tempo is marked as quarter note = 80, which is a moderate speed (Moderato).\n    *   **Key Signature**: There are three sharps (F♯, C♯, G♯), which corresponds to the key of A major or its relative minor, F♯ minor.\n    *   **Time Signature**: The time signature is 4/4 (common time).\n\n2.  **Analysis of the Musical Content**:\n    *   **Measures 1-2**: The piece begins quietly (`p` - piano). The right hand plays a simple, ascending melody in eighth notes: C♯, E, F♯, G♯, A, B, C♯, E. The left hand provides a very sparse accompaniment with a single C♯ note. This opening serves as a short, calm introduction or fanfare.\n    *   **Measure 3**: There is an abrupt and dramatic change. The dynamic shifts suddenly to `f` (forte), and the texture becomes dense and rhythmic. The right hand plays rapid sixteenth-note arpeggios (F♯-A-C♯-E), which outlines an F♯ minor 7th chord. The left hand plays driving, low F♯ octaves. This powerful, rhythmic section strongly contrasts with the lyrical opening. The harmony has clearly shifted to F♯ minor.\n    *   **Measures 4-8**: This high-energy pattern continues, moving through a chord progression. After the F♯ minor section, the harmony moves to what appears to be B minor and then E major. This progression (vi-ii-V in the key of A major) is very common in popular and game music.\n    *   **Overall Structure**: The defining characteristic of this excerpt is the stark contrast between a brief, quiet introductory melody and the sudden explosion into a loud, fast-paced, rhythmically intense main theme.\n\n3.  **Identification**:\n    *   The combination of the introductory fanfare and the subsequent energetic main riff is highly distinctive.\n    *   This musical structure is characteristic of the battle themes from the *Final Fantasy* video game series.\n    *   Specifically, the opening notes and the main rhythmic figure starting in measure 3 are iconic motifs from the main battle theme of the game *Final Fantasy VII*.\n    *   The piece is titled \"Fighting\" or \"Those Who Fight\" (\"更に闘う者達\" - *Sarani Tatakau Monotachi* in Japanese). It was composed by Nobuo Uematsu. The excerpt is from a piano arrangement of this famous battle theme.\n\n<<<Fighting (Those Who Fight) from Final Fantasy VII>>>"
