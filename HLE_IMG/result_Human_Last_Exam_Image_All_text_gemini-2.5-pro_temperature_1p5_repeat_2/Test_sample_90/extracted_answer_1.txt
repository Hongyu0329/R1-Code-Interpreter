The structures of the three products are:
**Product A**: A pyrrolizine derivative formed by the [3+2] cycloaddition of a C-acylated azomethine ylide with methyl propiolate, which may have undergone rearrangement. Its formula is C₁₄H₂₀N₂O₃.
**Product B**: (S)-2,3,8,9-tetrahydro-1H-dipyrrolo[1,2-a:1',2'-d]pyrazine-5,10-dione, a product of extensive rearrangement and oxidation of the initial cycloadduct. Its formula is C₁₂H₁₄N₂O₃.
**Product C**: A tricyclic product resulting from the intramolecular cyclization of the starting material's carboxylic acid and amidine functional groups, followed by acetylation. Its formula is C₁₁H₁₆N₂O₃.
