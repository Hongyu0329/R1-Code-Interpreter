    "An analysis of the problem to determine the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal and the Circuit**\nThe main objective is to find the cutoff frequency at node $a_0$. The circuit consists of an infinite resistive ladder network, an input source at node $c_0$, and a capacitor $C$ connected from node $a_0$ to ground. The circuit configuration at node $a_0$ with capacitor $C$ forms a first-order low-pass filter.\n\n**Step 2: Thevenin Equivalent Circuit**\nThe cutoff frequency of an RC low-pass filter is determined by the resistance and capacitance. In this case, the capacitance is $C$. The resistance is the Thevenin equivalent resistance, $R_{th}$, seen by the capacitor looking back into the ladder network from node $a_0$. The cutoff angular frequency, $\\omega_c$, is given by the formula:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C}$\nTo find $R_{th}$, we must calculate the equivalent resistance between node $a_0$ and ground, while deactivating all independent sources. Deactivating the input voltage source at $c_0$ means connecting node $c_0$ to ground.\n\n**Step 3: Calculating the Thevenin Resistance, $R_{th}$**\nWe will find $R_{th}$ by calculating the resistance between node $a_0$ and ground, with node $c_0$ also grounded. We can use node voltage analysis to solve for this resistance. Let's apply a test voltage $V_{a0}$ at node $a_0$ and find the current $I_{a0}$ drawn from the source. Then $R_{th} = V_{a0} / I_{a0}$.\n\nThe node voltages are denoted as $V_{cn}$ for nodes on the left rail and $V_{dn}$ for nodes on the right rail. The circuit structure from the diagram is:\n*   Vertical resistors connect $c_n$ to $c_{n+1}$ and $d_n$ to $d_{n+1}$.\n*   Horizontal resistors connect $c_n$ to $d_n$ for $n \\ge 1$.\n*   At the input/output end: a resistor connects $a_0$ to $d_1$, and a resistor connects $c_0$ to $c_1$. There is no resistor between $c_0$ and $a_0$.\n\nWe have the following boundary conditions for calculating $R_{th}$:\n*   $V_{c0} = 0$ (input source grounded).\n*   Let the voltage at node $a_0$ be $V_{a0}$.\n*   The node voltages $V_{cn}$ and $V_{dn}$ must go to zero as $n \\to \\infty$.\n\nKirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) at the nodes for $n \\ge 2$:\n*   At node $c_n$: $(V_{cn}-V_{c,n-1}) + (V_{cn}-V_{c,n+1}) + (V_{cn}-V_{dn}) = 0 \\implies V_{c,n-1} + V_{c,n+1} + V_{dn} - 3V_{cn} = 0$\n*   At node $d_n$: $(V_{dn}-V_{d,n-1}) + (V_{dn}-V_{d,n+1}) + (V_{dn}-V_{cn}) = 0 \\implies V_{d,n-1} + V_{d,n+1} + V_{cn} - 3V_{dn} = 0$\n\nThese are a pair of coupled linear difference equations. To solve them, we introduce symmetric ($S_n = V_{cn} + V_{dn}$) and anti-symmetric ($D_n = V_{cn} - V_{dn}$) combinations. The equations for $S_n$ and $D_n$ for $n \\ge 2$ become:\n*   $S_{n-1} - 2S_n + S_{n+1} = 0$\n*   $D_{n-1} - 4D_n + D_{n+1} = 0$\n\nThe solutions that decay as $n \\to \\infty$ are:\n*   $S_n = A$ (a constant)\n*   $D_n = C(2-\\sqrt{3})^n$\nLet $\\lambda = 2-\\sqrt{3}$. So $D_n = C\\lambda^n$.\nFrom these, we can express the node voltages for $n \\ge 1$ as:\n*   $V_{cn} = (S_n + D_n)/2 = (A + C\\lambda^n)/2$\n*   $V_{dn} = (S_n - D_n)/2 = (A - C\\lambda^n)/2$\n\nNow, we apply the KCL at nodes $c_1$ and $d_1$:\n*   KCL at $c_1$: $(V_{c1}-V_{c0}) + (V_{c1}-V_{c2}) + (V_{c1}-V_{d1}) = 0$. Since $V_{c0}=0$, this is $3V_{c1} - V_{c2} - V_{d1} = 0$.\n*   KCL at $d_1$: $(V_{d1}-V_{a0}) + (V_{d1}-V_{d2}) + (V_{d1}-V_{c1}) = 0 \\implies V_{a0} + V_{c1} + V_{d2} - 3V_{d1} = 0$.\n\nSubstitute the general solutions into the KCL at $c_1$:\n$3(A + C\\lambda)/2 - (A + C\\lambda^2)/2 - (A - C\\lambda)/2 = 0 \\implies A + C\\lambda(4-\\lambda) = 0$.\nSince $\\lambda=2-\\sqrt{3}$, we have $4-\\lambda=2+\\sqrt{3}$, so $\\lambda(4-\\lambda)=(2-\\sqrt{3})(2+\\sqrt{3})=1$.\nThis gives the condition $A+C=0$, or $C = -A$.\n\nSubstitute the general solutions and $V_{a0}$ into the KCL at $d_1$:\n$V_{a0} + (A+C\\lambda)/2 + (A-C\\lambda^2)/2 - 3(A-C\\lambda)/2 = 0 \\implies 2V_{a0} - A + C\\lambda(4-\\lambda) = 0$.\nThis simplifies to $2V_{a0} - A + C = 0$.\n\nWe have two equations for the constants $A$ and $C$ and the applied voltage $V_{a0}$:\n1.  $C = -A$\n2.  $2V_{a0} - A + C = 0$\nSubstituting (1) into (2) gives $2V_{a0} - A - A = 0 \\implies 2V_{a0} = 2A \\implies V_{a0} = A$.\nSo, we have $A=V_{a0}$ and $C=-V_{a0}$.\n\nNow we find $R_{th}$. The current $I_{a0}$ entering node $a_0$ is $I_{a0} = (V_{a0} - V_{d1})/r$.\n$R_{th} = \\frac{V_{a0}}{I_{a0}} = \\frac{r V_{a0}}{V_{a0} - V_{d1}} = \\frac{r}{1 - V_{d1}/V_{a0}}$.\nWe calculate $V_{d1}$:\n$V_{d1} = (A - C\\lambda)/2 = (V_{a0} - (-V_{a0})\\lambda)/2 = \\frac{V_{a0}(1+\\lambda)}{2}$.\nSo, $\\frac{V_{d1}}{V_{a0}} = \\frac{1+\\lambda}{2} = \\frac{1+(2-\\sqrt{3})}{2} = \\frac{3-\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\nSubstitute this ratio back into the expression for $R_{th}$:\n$R_{th} = \\frac{r}{1 - \\frac{3-\\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \\frac{r}{\\frac{2 - (3-\\sqrt{3})}{2}} = \\frac{2r}{-1+\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{2r}{\\sqrt{3}-1}$.\nTo simplify, we rationalize the denominator:\n$R_{th} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3}+1)}{(\\sqrt{3}-1)(\\sqrt{3}+1)} = \\frac{2r(\\sqrt{3}+1)}{3-1} = r(\\sqrt{3}+1)$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Cutoff Frequency**\nNow that we have the Thevenin resistance, we can find the cutoff frequency.\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{R_{th}C} = \\frac{1}{r(\\sqrt{3}+1)C}$.\nWe can rationalize this expression as well for a cleaner form:\n$\\omega_c = \\frac{1}{(\\sqrt{3}+1)rC} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\sqrt{3}-1} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{(3-1)rC} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{2rC}$.\n\nThe cutoff frequency at node $a_0$ is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{2rC}$."
