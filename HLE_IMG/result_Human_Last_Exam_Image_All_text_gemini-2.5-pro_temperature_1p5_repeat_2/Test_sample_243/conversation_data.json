    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to answer the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key features of the plant in the image.**\nThe plant shown in the image has several distinct characteristics:\n*   **Leaves:** The leaves are the most prominent feature. They are dark green, have an elongated oval or lance-like shape, and are covered in a striking, intricate network of silvery-white or pale green veins. This pattern is known as reticulate venation.\n*   **Arrangement:** The leaves are clustered towards the ends of the branches, appearing in a whorl-like formation.\n*   **Texture:** The leaves appear leathery and robust, suggesting an evergreen shrub.\n*   **Stems:** The central part where the new leaves emerge shows a slightly purplish hue.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the plant species.**\nBased on the unique leaf venation and growth habit, the plant can be identified as a species within the genus *Daphne*. While there are a few species with similar reticulated leaves, such as *Daphne feddei* (native to mainland China), a particularly strong match is **Daphne pseudomezereum**. This plant is highly prized for its ornamental leaves which perfectly match those in the photograph.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the native habitat of the identified plant.**\nThe question specifically asks for the name of the island to which this plant was endemic. This is a crucial clue that helps distinguish it from similar-looking species with different geographical distributions.\n*   *Daphne feddei* is native to several provinces in mainland China, so it is not endemic to an island.\n*   *Daphne pseudomezereum*, however, is a rare plant with a very restricted natural range. Botanical sources confirm that it is endemic to a single specific island.\n\n**Step 4: Pinpoint the island.**\nResearch on the distribution of *Daphne pseudomezereum* reveals that it is native exclusively to **Jeju Island** (also spelled Cheju Island), a volcanic island belonging to South Korea. It is found specifically in the understory of forests on Mount Halla (Hallasan), the volcano that forms the island. The species is considered endangered due to its rarity and limited habitat.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy identifying the plant as *Daphne pseudomezereum* based on its unique visual characteristics and then researching its specific endemic habitat, we can confidently name the island it originates from.\n\n<<<Jeju Island>>>"
