    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the average inter-burst interval.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the timestamps of synchronized bursts.**\nA synchronized burst is a period of high-density, simultaneous firing across many electrodes. Visually, these appear as dense vertical bands in the raster plot. We need to identify the center time for each of these bursts.\n\n1.  **Burst 1:** The first distinct burst is centered approximately halfway between the 0s and 5s marks. A reasonable estimate for its center is **3.5 s**.\n2.  **Burst 2:** The second burst is clearly centered on the halfway mark between 10s and 20s. Its center is at **15 s**.\n3.  **Burst 3:** The third burst is located between 25s and 30s, appearing slightly closer to 25s. A good estimate for its center is **27 s**.\n4.  **Burst 4:** The fourth burst is located between 35s and 40s. It appears to be centered around **38 s**.\n5.  **Burst 5:** The final burst is centered right on the **50 s** mark at the end of the recording.\n\nThe timestamps of the synchronized bursts are approximately: 3.5 s, 15 s, 27 s, 38 s, and 50 s.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the inter-burst intervals (IBI).**\nThe inter-burst interval is the time difference between the centers of consecutive bursts. With five bursts, we can calculate four intervals.\n\n*   **IBI 1:** Time between Burst 2 and Burst 1 = 15 s - 3.5 s = **11.5 s**\n*   **IBI 2:** Time between Burst 3 and Burst 2 = 27 s - 15 s = **12 s**\n*   **IBI 3:** Time between Burst 4 and Burst 3 = 38 s - 27 s = **11 s**\n*   **IBI 4:** Time between Burst 5 and Burst 4 = 50 s - 38 s = **12 s**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the average inter-burst interval.**\nThe average IBI is the sum of the individual intervals divided by the number of intervals.\n\n*   **Sum of IBIs:** 11.5 s + 12 s + 11 s + 12 s = 46.5 s\n*   **Number of intervals:** 4\n*   **Average IBI:** 46.5 s / 4 = **11.625 s**\n\n**Step 4: Round the average to two significant figures.**\nThe calculated average is 11.625 s. The question requires the answer to be expressed with two significant figures.\n\n*   The first two significant figures are '1' and '1'.\n*   The third digit is '6'. Since this digit is 5 or greater, we round up the second significant figure.\n*   Therefore, 11.625 s rounded to two significant figures is **12 s**.\n\n**Careful points considered:**\n*   **Burst Identification:** The \"center\" of a burst can be subjective. We consistently chose the time of highest spike density within the burst period for accuracy.\n*   **Reading the Scale:** Estimates were made carefully based on the provided time axis ticks (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 s).\n*   **Significant Figures:** The final calculation was correctly rounded according to the prompt's requirement for two significant figures.\n\nThe final calculated and correctly rounded average inter-burst interval is 12 s.\n\n<<<12>>>"
