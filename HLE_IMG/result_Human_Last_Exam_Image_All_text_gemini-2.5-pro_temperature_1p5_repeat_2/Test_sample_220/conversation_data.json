    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which crystal lattice pattern represents a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) Structure**\nAn FCC unit cell has atoms at the eight corners of a cube and at the center of each of the six faces. The basis atoms in fractional coordinates are (0, 0, 0), (1/2, 1/2, 0), (1/2, 0, 1/2), and (0, 1/2, 1/2).\n\n**Step 2: Understand the [110] Viewing Direction**\nThe [110] direction points along a face diagonal of the cubic unit cell. When we view a crystal structure along a specific direction, we are essentially looking at the projection of the atomic positions onto a 2D plane perpendicular to that direction.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Theoretical Projection Pattern for FCC along [110]**\nWhen an FCC lattice is projected onto a plane perpendicular to the [110] direction, the resulting 2D pattern is a **centered rectangular lattice**. This means the repeating unit in the projection is a rectangle with atoms at its four corners and one atom at its geometric center. This is a well-known result from crystallography. The sides of this rectangle correspond to the [001] and [1-10] directions of the original cube, and their lengths are in the ratio of `a` to `aâˆš2`, where `a` is the cubic lattice constant.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Each Image**\n\n*   **Image A:** This image shows atoms arranged in simple rectangular layers stacked directly on top of each other. The projection onto the front face would be a simple rectangular grid. This pattern is characteristic of a simple cubic (SC) lattice viewed along a <100> direction, not a centered rectangle.\n*   **Image B:** This image shows atoms at different depths (indicated by the different sphere sizes). Let's focus on the group of larger atoms, which are co-planar. There are five such atoms. Four of them form the vertices of a parallelogram, and the fifth atom is located exactly at the center of this parallelogram (at the intersection of its diagonals). In a 3D perspective drawing, a rectangle viewed at an angle appears as a parallelogram. Therefore, this pattern represents a **centered rectangle** (seen as a centered parallelogram). This matches the theoretical prediction for an FCC lattice viewed along the [110] direction.\n*   **Image C:** The arrangement of atoms in this image shows clear hexagonal and triangular symmetry. This is the characteristic projection pattern of an FCC lattice viewed along the [111] direction (the body diagonal).\n*   **Image D:** This image shows a rectangular grid of atoms, with another set of atoms located in the center of each rectangular cell. This is a clear \"centered rectangular\" pattern. This is characteristic of a body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice viewed along a <100> direction.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Analysis**\nBased on the analysis of the projected patterns:\n*   Image A corresponds to a simple cubic structure.\n*   Image B displays a centered parallelogram (a perspective view of a centered rectangle), which is the signature of an FCC [110] view.\n*   Image C displays a hexagonal pattern, corresponding to an FCC [111] view.\n*   Image D displays a centered square/rectangular pattern, corresponding to a BCC [100] view.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is B.\n\n<<<B>>>"
