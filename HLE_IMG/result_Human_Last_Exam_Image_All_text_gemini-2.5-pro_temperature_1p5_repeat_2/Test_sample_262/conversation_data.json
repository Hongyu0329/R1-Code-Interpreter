    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which of the four complexes are expected to show shorter lifetimes as emitters in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs).\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks to identify which of the four depicted iridium(III) complexes will likely have a shorter operational lifetime in an LEC. Shorter lifetime correlates with lower chemical stability of the emitter complex under device operating conditions.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the General Structure of the Complexes**\nAll four complexes are cationic iridium(III) complexes with the general formula `[Ir(C^N)2(N^N)]+ PF6-`.\n*   **Metal Center:** All complexes have an Iridium(III) (Ir(III)) core.\n*   **Ancillary Ligand (N^N):** All four complexes share the same ancillary ligand, which is 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine (`dtbbpy`). Since this ligand is identical in all four cases, it does not contribute to the difference in their lifetimes.\n*   **Cyclometalating Ligands (C^N):** The key difference between the four complexes lies in the two identical cyclometalating C^N ligands. These are all derivatives of 2-phenylpyridine (ppy), where the phenyl ring is substituted with fluorine atoms. The stability of the complex is highly dependent on the nature and position of these fluorine substituents.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Key Factors Affecting the Stability and Lifetime of Ir(III) Complexes**\nThe operational stability of these phosphorescent emitters is primarily determined by the robustness of the cyclometalating ligands, especially the Iridium-Carbon (Ir-C) bond, which is often the weakest point in the molecule. Two main strategies involving fluorination are used to enhance stability:\n\n1.  **Steric Protection:** Placing a substituent, such as a fluorine atom, at the position *ortho* to the Ir-C bond on the phenyl ring. This sterically shields the bond from attack by other chemical species (e.g., water, oxygen, ions) present in the LEC, preventing reactions that lead to bond cleavage and degradation. This is often referred to as a \"steric lock\".\n2.  **Electronic Stabilization:** Fluorine is a highly electronegative and electron-withdrawing atom. Placing fluorine atoms on the phenyl ring, particularly at the *para* position relative to the Ir-C bond, significantly lowers the energy of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of the complex. A lower HOMO makes the complex more difficult to oxidize, thereby increasing its stability against oxidative degradation pathways, which are common failure modes in LECs.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Each Complex based on these Stability Factors**\nLet's analyze the substitution pattern of the fluorines on the phenyl ring of the C^N ligand for each complex, relative to the Ir-C bond. We will define the carbon atom bonded to Iridium as C1 and the adjacent carbon bonded to the pyridine ring as C2. The other carbons on the phenyl ring are numbered C3 to C6. The key positions for stabilization are the *ortho* position (C6) and the *para* position (C4).\n\n*   **Complex 1:** The fluorine atoms are located at positions C4 and C5.\n    *   *Ortho* (C6) position: No fluorine. -> **No steric protection.**\n    *   *Para* (C4) position: Has a fluorine. -> **Has electronic stabilization.**\n    *   Conclusion: This complex lacks the crucial steric protection at the ortho position, making the Ir-C bond vulnerable.\n\n*   **Complex 2:** The fluorine atoms are located at positions C4 and C6.\n    *   *Ortho* (C6) position: Has a fluorine. -> **Has steric protection.**\n    *   *Para* (C4) position: Has a fluorine. -> **Has electronic stabilization.**\n    *   Conclusion: This complex benefits from both steric and electronic stabilization, suggesting high stability.\n\n*   **Complex 3:** The single fluorine atom is located at position C6.\n    *   *Ortho* (C6) position: Has a fluorine. -> **Has steric protection.**\n    *   *Para* (C4) position: No fluorine. -> **Lacks strong electronic stabilization.**\n    *   Conclusion: While sterically protected, this complex is likely more susceptible to oxidative degradation than those with a para-fluorine substituent due to a relatively higher HOMO energy.\n\n*   **Complex 4:** The fluorine atoms are located at positions C4, C5, and C6.\n    *   *Ortho* (C6) position: Has a fluorine. -> **Has steric protection.**\n    *   *Para* (C4) position: Has a fluorine. -> **Has electronic stabilization.**\n    *   Conclusion: This complex has both key stabilizing features, plus an additional meta-fluorine, making it likely the most stable of the four.\n\n**Step 5: Determine Which Complexes Have Shorter Lifetimes**\nBased on the analysis, we can group the complexes by their expected stability:\n*   **High Stability (Longer Lifetimes):** Complexes [2] and [4] possess both ortho-steric protection and para-electronic stabilization. They are expected to have the longest lifetimes.\n*   **Lower Stability (Shorter Lifetimes):**\n    *   Complex [1] lacks the critical ortho-steric protection, which is a major design flaw leading to instability. It is expected to have a short lifetime.\n    *   Complex [3] has steric protection but lacks the strong electronic stabilization from a para-fluorine atom. This makes it more prone to oxidation than complexes [2] and [4]. Therefore, it is also expected to have a shorter lifetime compared to them.\n\nBoth Complex [1] and Complex [3] are missing at least one of the key stabilizing features that are present in Complexes [2] and [4]. Therefore, both are expected to exhibit shorter operational lifetimes.\n\nFinal Answer: The complexes expected to show shorter lifetimes are [1] and [3].\n\nThis corresponds to answer choice F.\n\n<<<F>>>"
