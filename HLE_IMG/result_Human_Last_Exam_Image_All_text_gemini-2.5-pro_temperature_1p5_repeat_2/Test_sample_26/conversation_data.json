    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of the first movement of Beethoven's \"Pathétique\" Sonata.\n\n1.  **Identify the Piece, Movement, and Key:**\n    *   The piece is Ludwig van Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 8 in C minor, Op. 13, known as the \"Pathétique\".\n    *   The music shown is from the first movement, \"Allegro di molto e con brio\".\n    *   The key signature has three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭). This indicates the key of E♭ major or its relative, C minor. The overall tonality of this movement is C minor. Therefore, the tonic (i) is the C minor chord (C-E♭-G).\n\n2.  **Locate Measure 30:**\n    *   The staff system containing the measure in question begins with the number \"28\".\n    *   Measure 28 is the first measure of the system.\n    *   Measure 29 is the second measure.\n    *   Measure 30 is the third measure, which is circled in the provided image.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Notes in Measure 30:**\n    *   The measure is divided into two main harmonic events, one on each beat of the 2/2 time signature (alla breve).\n    *   **Beat 1:**\n        *   Right Hand (Treble Clef): The sixteenth notes are G, E♮, C, G.\n        *   Left Hand (Bass Clef): A chord with the notes G and E♮ is played.\n        *   Combining the notes from both hands on beat 1 gives us C, E♮, and G.\n    *   **Beat 2:**\n        *   Right Hand (Treble Clef): The sixteenth notes are F♯, D, B♭, F♯.\n        *   Left Hand (Bass Clef): A chord with the notes F♯ and D is played.\n        *   Combining the notes from both hands on beat 2 gives us B♭, D, and F♯.\n\n4.  **Identify the Chords and their Function:**\n    *   **Chord on Beat 1:** The notes C, E♮, and G form a **C major triad**.\n    *   **Chord on Beat 2:** The notes B♭, D, and F♯ form a **B♭ augmented triad**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Roman Numeral:**\n    *   The question asks for a single Roman numeral for the entire measure. In such cases, we typically analyze the harmony on the strong beat(s), as subsequent harmonies are often passing or decorative. The harmony on beat 1 is the most structurally important.\n    *   The chord is C major. We need to determine its function within the key of C minor.\n    *   The tonic chord (i) in C minor is C minor (C-E♭-G).\n    *   The subdominant chord (iv) in C minor is F minor (F-A♭-C).\n    *   The dominant of F minor would be a C major chord (C-E♮-G). This type of chord, which is the dominant of another diatonic chord, is called a **secondary dominant**.\n    *   In this case, the C major chord is functioning as the dominant of the subdominant chord (iv).\n    *   This function is written as **V/iv** (read as \"five of four\").\n    *   The B♭ augmented chord on the second beat acts as a chromatic passing chord, creating tension and leading smoothly into the C minor chord (i) at the beginning of measure 31. The primary, defining harmony of measure 30 is the C major chord.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe main harmony in measure 30 is the C major chord on beat 1. In the key of C minor, this chord functions as the dominant of the subdominant (F minor). Therefore, the correct Roman numeral is V/iv.\n\n<<<V/iv>>>"
