The structure of compound A is 3,7-dimethylocta-1,6-diene. Here is its skeletal structure:
```

```
This might be confusing. Let me represent it better.
```
      CH3
      |
CH2=CH-CH-CH2-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2
```
A skeletal drawing:
A six-carbon chain with a double bond at one end (C1-C2) and another double bond two carbons from the other end (C6-C7 of an octadiene chain). Methyl groups are on C3 and C7.
```
     /
\ /=\

This is also not great. Let's provide the final structure as an image-like description.

The structure has an 8-carbon backbone. Let's number from the terminal double bond.
C1: CH2
C2: CH, double-bonded to C1.
C3: CH, single-bonded to C2 and has a methyl group.
C4: CH2
C5: CH2
C6: CH, double-bonded to C7.
C7: C, has two methyl groups attached.
This is 3,7-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

Let me draw a more standard skeletal formula representation: A CH2=CH group at one end, then a CH with a methyl group pointing up, then a CH2-CH2 linker, then a CH=C(CH3)2 group.
