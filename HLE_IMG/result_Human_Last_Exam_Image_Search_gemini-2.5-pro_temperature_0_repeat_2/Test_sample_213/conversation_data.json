    "Based on the provided sheet music, the opera is Richard Wagner's **Tristan und Isolde**.\n\nThe score excerpt is the very beginning of Act II. Key indicators in the music itself and the accompanying text confirm this identification:\n\n*   **Instrumentation**: The score calls for a large orchestra, including specific instruments like the English Horn (\"engl. Horn\"), which is characteristic of Wagner's romantic compositions.\n*   **German Annotations**: The instructions are in German. For instance, \"(Vorhang)\" translates to \"(Curtain),\" signaling the start of the act, and \"(mit DÃ¤mpfer)\" means \"(with mute)\" for the strings.\n*   **Musical Content**: The specific melodic line and harmonic language are hallmarks of Wagner's style during the period he composed *Tristan und Isolde*. The opera, first performed in 1865, is renowned for its advanced use of chromaticism and orchestration, all of which are evident in this passage.\n\nMultiple sources confirm that this music is indeed the opening of the second act of the opera.\n\n<<<Tristan und Isolde>>>"
