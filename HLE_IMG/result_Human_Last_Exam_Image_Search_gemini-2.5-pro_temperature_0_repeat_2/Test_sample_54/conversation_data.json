    "Based on the provided reaction scheme, the reagents A and B can be identified as follows:\n\n**Reagent A: Hydrazine (H₂N-NH₂) **\n\nThe conversion of compound **1** (a trioxatriangulenium salt) to compound **2** involves the replacement of one of the oxygen atoms in the heterocyclic rings with an N-amino (`-NH₂`) group. This type of transformation, where a pyrylium salt is converted into an N-aminopyridinium salt, is a well-established reaction that uses hydrazine as the nitrogen source.\n\n**Reagent B: n-Propylamine (CH₃CH₂CH₂NH₂) **\n\nThe reaction from compound **2** to compound **3** involves two significant changes:\n1.  One of the remaining pyrylium-like rings (containing oxygen) is converted into an N-propyl-pyridinium ring. This requires a primary amine to introduce the nitrogen and the alkyl group. The presence of an n-propyl group (`-CH₂CH₂CH₃`) on the nitrogen in product **3** indicates that **n-propylamine** was used.\n2.  The N-amino group (`-N-NH₂`) on the first nitrogen ring is converted to an amino group (`-NH`). This is a deamination reaction. While this is often performed as a separate step (for instance, using a reducing agent like zinc in acetic acid or an oxidizing agent like nitrous acid), it is represented here as part of the overall transformation caused by reagent B.\n\nTherefore, n-propylamine is the essential reagent for the formation of the N-propyl ring structure in compound **3**.\n\n<<<A is Hydrazine and B is n-Propylamine>>>"
