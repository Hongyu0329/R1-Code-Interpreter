    "The element with these spectral lines is **Uranium (U)**.\n\nThe image displays a complex emission spectrum with numerous lines spread across the visible light range, from blue to red. This intricate pattern is a characteristic fingerprint of the element uranium.\n\nUranium's spectrum is known for its large number of emission lines. Scientific sources confirm that uranium has prominent spectral lines in the blue, green, yellow, and red regions of the spectrum, which is consistent with the provided image. For instance, a strong emission line for uranium atoms has been identified at 591.5 nm, which falls in the yellow-orange part of the spectrum. The overall visual complexity of the spectrum in the image is a key indicator for heavy elements like uranium.\n\n<<<Uranium>>>"
