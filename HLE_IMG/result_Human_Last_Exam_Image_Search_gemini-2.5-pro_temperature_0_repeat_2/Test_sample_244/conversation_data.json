    "The epiphytic species visible in the image is a type of fungus commonly known as sooty mold. This mold is not a single species but rather a collective term for various ascomycete fungi that grow on plant surfaces.\n\nThe characteristic black, net-like, or thread-like appearance is the mycelium of the fungus. Sooty molds are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic. They derive their nutrients from a sugary substance called honeydew, which is excreted by sap-sucking insects like aphids and scale insects, or from the plant's own sugary exudates.\n\nWhile a definitive identification of the exact genus would require microscopic examination, the growth seen in the image is characteristic of several common sooty mold genera. These include, but are not limited to:\n*   *Capnodium*\n*   *Scorias*\n*   *Cladosporium*\n*   *Alternaria*\n*   *Aethaloderma*\n*   *Euantennaria*\n*   *Trichomerium*\n\nThe presence of sooty mold is often an indicator of an insect infestation on the tree. Although generally harmless to the tree itself as it doesn't draw nutrients from it, a heavy growth can block sunlight and slightly impair photosynthesis.\n\n<<<Sooty mold (various genera including *Capnodium*, *Scorias*, *Cladosporium*)>>>"
