    "The correct Roman numeral for measure 30 of the first movement of Beethoven's \"Path√©tique\" Sonata is V7/iv.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the harmonic analysis:\n*   **Key Signature:** The sonata is in C minor.\n*   **Chord in Measure 30:** The notes played in measure 30 are G, B-natural, D, and F in both the right and left hands. This combination of notes forms a G dominant 7th chord (G7).\n*   **Function in C minor:** In the key of C minor, the tonic chord is C minor. The chord in measure 30, G7, functions as a secondary dominant. Specifically, it is the dominant of F minor.\n*   **Roman Numeral:** The F minor chord is the subdominant (iv) in the key of C minor. Therefore, the G7 chord, which leads to F minor, is analyzed as the \"dominant of the subdominant,\" written as V7/iv. Some analyses might also refer to this as an augmented 6th chord."
