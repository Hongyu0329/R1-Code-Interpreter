    "This piece of music is Frédéric Chopin's Étude Op. 10, No. 4 in C-sharp minor.\n\nThis virtuosic and passionate study was composed in 1830 and is characterized by its very fast tempo and continuous sixteenth-note passages for both hands. It is sometimes nicknamed the \"Torrent\" Etude. The key signature of C-sharp minor, along with the rapid arpeggios and dramatic dynamic shifts seen in the sheet music, are all hallmarks of this famous and challenging piano piece.\n\n<<<Frédéric Chopin - Etude Op. 10, No. 4>>>"
