    "The reaction proceeds through two main steps: a 4π electrocyclic ring opening, followed by a Diels-Alder cycloaddition.\n\n**Step 1: 4π Electrocyclic Ring Opening**\n\nThe starting material is a substituted cyclobutene, likely 2-methoxy-4-methyl-4-methoxycyclobut-1-ene, where the methyl (Me) and methoxy (OMe) groups on the C4 carbon are *trans* to each other. Under thermal conditions (indicated by Δ), a 4π electrocyclic reaction occurs in a conrotatory fashion, meaning the substituents on the breaking bond rotate in the same direction. This process breaks the C3-C4 sigma bond to form a conjugated diene.\n\nThe conrotatory opening of the single enantiomer of the starting cyclobutene can proceed in two ways, leading to two different geometric isomers of the resulting diene, 2-methoxy-4-methoxy-4-methyl-1,3-butadiene:\n*   **Rotation Mode 1:** Leads to the (E)-isomer of the diene.\n*   **Rotation Mode 2:** Leads to the (Z)-isomer of the diene.\n\nElectron-donating groups, such as the methoxy group, generally prefer to rotate outwards during this type of ring opening.\n\n**Step 2: Diels-Alder Cycloaddition**\n\nEach of the two diene isomers then reacts with the dienophile, ethyl acrylate (CH₂=CH-CO₂Et). This is a Diels-Alder reaction, which forms a six-membered ring.\n\n*   **Regiochemistry:** The diene is electron-rich due to the methoxy groups, and the dienophile is electron-poor due to the ethyl ester group (–CO₂Et). The reaction proceeds with a predictable regioselectivity, often referred to as the \"ortho\" product. The C1 of the diene (the CH₂ group) bonds to the C2 of the dienophile, and the C4 of the diene (the C(Me)OMe group) bonds to the C1 of the dienophile (the CHCO₂Et group). This leads to a cyclohexene product where the quaternary center and the ester group are on adjacent carbons.\n\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The problem specifies that the reaction occurs in an *endo* fashion. The endo rule predicts that the electron-withdrawing substituent on the dienophile (the –CO₂Et group) will be oriented *syn* (on the same side) to the \"inside\" substituents of the diene in the transition state.\n\nApplying the endo rule to the two diene isomers gives two different products:\n1.  The reaction of the **(E)-diene** via an endo transition state leads to **Product A**. In this product, the methyl group on the quaternary center is *cis* to the hydrogen on the adjacent carbon bearing the ester group, while the methoxy group is *trans*.\n2.  The reaction of the **(Z)-diene** via an endo transition state leads to **Product B**. In this case, the methoxy group on the quaternary center is *cis* to the hydrogen on the adjacent carbon, and the methyl group is *trans*.\n\nTherefore, the two products formed from the endo Diels-Alder reaction are A and B.\n\n<<<A and B>>>"
