    "The sequence of erasure poems, from which the image is taken, adheres to the **tanka** poetic form.\n\nThe image is a page from the book *A Little White Shadow* by the American poet Mary Ruefle. In this work, Ruefle creates poems by erasing words from a nineteenth-century novel, leaving only select words on each page to form a new poem.\n\nCritics and publishers consistently identify the poetic form used throughout this collection as the tanka. A tanka is a traditional Japanese poetic form consisting of five lines with a specific syllable structure:\n*   **Line 1:** 5 syllables\n*   **Line 2:** 7 syllables\n*   **Line 3:** 5 syllables\n*   **Line 4:** 7 syllables\n*   **Line 5:** 7 syllables\n\nThis five-line structure totals 31 syllables. Traditionally, the first three lines (the *kami-no-ku*) present an image or observation, while the final two lines (the *shimo-no-ku*) offer a reflection or emotional response to that image. While some modern poets adapt the syllable count flexibly, the 5-7-5-7-7 structure is the defining feature of the form.\n\n<<<Tanka>>>"
