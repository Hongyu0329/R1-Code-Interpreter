    "The image illustrates an auditory illusion known as the **perceptual restoration effect**, also called the **auditory continuity illusion**.\n\nThis phenomenon occurs when a sound, such as a tone or speech, is interrupted by a different sound, like a burst of noise. The brain's auditory system automatically \"fills in\" the missing portion of the original sound, leading to the perception that it is continuous and was simply masked by the interrupting noise. The image displays this with a spectrogram (top) and a waveform (bottom), showing a steady tone being physically interrupted by a brief, broader-frequency noise.\n\nThis effect is a powerful example of how the brain uses context and prior knowledge to create a stable and continuous perception of the world from incomplete sensory information. The comparison to the Necker Cube is apt because both are examples of multistable perception, where the brain resolves an ambiguous stimulus into a stable, coherent interpretation. In this case, the auditory system assumes it is more likely that a continuous tone is being temporarily obscured by noise rather than stopping and starting again.\n\n<<<Perceptual restoration effect>>>"
