    "Based on the visible runes and their arrangement, the image depicts the **Gripsholm Runestone**, which has the identifier **Sö 179**.\n\nThis stone is one of the approximately 26 Ingvar runestones, which commemorate those who died during a Viking expedition to the Caspian Sea led by Ingvar the Far-Travelled. The inscription on Sö 179 was raised by a woman named Tóla in memory of her son Harald, who was Ingvar's brother. The text mentions that they \"travelled valiantly far for gold, and in the east gave (food) to the eagle,\" a poetic way of saying they fought in battles, and that they ultimately \"died in the south in Serkland,\" the Old Norse name for the Saracen lands.\n\nDiscovered in the 1820s used as a threshold in the cellar of Gripsholm Castle, the stone was eventually retrieved and can now be seen near the castle entrance.\n\n<<<Sö 179>>>"
