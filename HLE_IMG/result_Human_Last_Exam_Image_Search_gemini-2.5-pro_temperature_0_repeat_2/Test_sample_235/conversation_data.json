    "To determine the metric pattern of the erasure poem, one must first identify the words of the poem and then analyze their syllabic and stress patterns against the definitions of the given options.\n\nThe words of the poem, read from top to bottom, are: \"rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work\".\n\nLet's analyze the provided answer choices:\n*   **A. free verse:** Poetry that does not have a regular meter or rhyme scheme.\n*   **B. iambic pentameter:** A line of verse with five metrical feet, each consisting of one unstressed syllable followed by one stressed syllable (10 syllables total).\n*   **C. alexandrine:** A line of verse with twelve syllables.\n*   **D. sapphic:** A stanzaic form consisting of three 11-syllable lines and a final 5-syllable line.\n*   **E. loose iambic trimeter:** A line with three iambic feet (6 syllables), with some variations allowed.\n*   **F. american sentence:** A poetic form invented by Allen Ginsberg that consists of a single sentence of 17 syllables.\n\nNow, let's count the syllables in the poem to test these patterns. The words can be read as a single phrase: \"Rules and lines, an intricate spider's web work.\"\n\nSyllable count:\n*   rules (1)\n*   and (1)\n*   lines (1)\n*   an (1)\n*   in-tri-cate (3)\n*   spi-der's (2)\n*   web (1)\n*   work (1)\n\nThe total number of syllables is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 11.\n\nThis count immediately rules out iambic pentameter (10 syllables), alexandrine (12 syllables), loose iambic trimeter (around 6 syllables), and sapphic (a multi-line stanza form).\n\nThe poem does not fit the strict 17-syllable rule of an American sentence. Since the poem does not adhere to a regular meter or a specific syllable count per line, it is best described as free verse. The words are arranged for visual and thematic effect rather than to fit a traditional metrical structure.\n\n<<<A>>>"
