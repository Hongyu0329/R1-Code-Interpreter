    "The bryophyte shown in the image belongs to the genus *Ptilidium*.\n\nThis plant is a type of leafy liverwort, not a moss. Its distinctive appearance comes from its leaves, which are deeply divided and have finely fringed or toothed edges, resembling small feathers. The name *Ptilidium* itself is derived from the Greek word for \"small feather,\" which refers to this characteristic. The densely overlapping leaves on short, rounded branches give the plant a feathery or braided look.\n\nThe genus includes three species: *Ptilidium californicum*, *Ptilidium ciliare*, and *Ptilidium pulcherrimum*. These species are typically found in the arctic and subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere, often growing on tree bark, rocks, or soil in coniferous forests. The plants form dense, interwoven mats that can be yellowish-green to reddish-brown in color.\n\n<<<Ptilidium>>>"
