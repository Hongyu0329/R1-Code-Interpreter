    "The main difference in the sporophyte between *Grimmia montana* and *Grimmia curviseta* that helps distinguish both species at a glance is the seta, which is the stalk that supports the capsule.\n\nIn *Grimmia montana*, the seta is **straight** and short. The capsules are ovoid, brown, and held erect.\n\nIn contrast, *Grimmia curviseta* has a distinctly **arcuate or curved** seta. This curvature of the stalk supporting the capsule is a key diagnostic feature for the species.\n\n<<<The main distinguishing feature of the sporophyte is that *Grimmia montana* has a straight seta, while *Grimmia curviseta* has a curved (arcuate) seta.>>>"
