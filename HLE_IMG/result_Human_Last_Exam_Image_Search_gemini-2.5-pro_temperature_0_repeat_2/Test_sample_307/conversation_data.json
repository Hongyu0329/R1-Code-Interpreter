    "To find the ratio of the maximum to the minimum infinity-norm among the nine Wigner 3-j symbols visualized, we must first identify the parameters of each symbol and then calculate their maximum absolute values.\n\n### Identification of the Wigner 3-j Symbols\n\nA search for the source of the image reveals it is Figure 2 from the paper \"Semiclassical structure of the Wigner 9-j symbol\" by M. A. Caprio, M. A. McCoy, and D. J. Rowe (2014). The caption and related presentations by the author specify the parameters for the nine plots. Each plot represents the Wigner 3-j symbol `(j1 j2 j3; m1 m2 m3)` with `j1 = 8` and `j2 = 8`. The nine panels correspond to nine different integer values for `j3` that satisfy the selection rules.\n\nThe mapping from the panel number to the `j3` value is as follows:\n*   **Panel 1:** `j3 = 8`\n*   **Panel 2:** `j3 = 10`\n*   **Panel 3:** `j3 = 4`\n*   **Panel 4:** `j3 = 6`\n*   **Panel 5:** `j3 = 12`\n*   **Panel 6:** `j3 = 14`\n*   **Panel 7:** `j3 = 16`\n*   **Panel 8:** `j3 = 2`\n*   **Panel 9:** `j3 = 0`\n\n### Calculation of the Infinity-Norms\n\nThe infinity-norm of each symbol is its maximum absolute value over all possible magnetic quantum numbers `m1` and `m2`. These values can be computed using specialized software or online calculators.\n\n*   **Maximum Infinity-Norm:** The largest values for the 3-j symbols are often found when one of the `j` parameters is small. Visual inspection shows that Panel 9 (`j3=0`) has the most intense colors. For the symbol `(8 8 0; m1 m2 0)`, the value is non-zero only if `m1 = -m2`, and its absolute value is constant:\n    *   `|(8 8 0; m -m 0)| = 1 / sqrt(2*8 + 1) = 1 / sqrt(17)`\n    *   The maximum norm is therefore `1 / sqrt(17)` ≈ 0.2425.\n\n*   **Minimum Infinity-Norm:** The smallest maximum values often occur for \"stretched\" cases where `j3` is at the limit of the triangle inequality (`j3 = j1 + j2`). Visual inspection shows that Panel 7 (`j3=16`) is the faintest. The infinity-norm for this case corresponds to the value at `m1=m2=m3=0`.\n    *   Using a Wigner 3-j symbol calculator, the value of `(8 8 16; 0 0 0)` is approximately 0.03848.\n\n### Ratio Calculation\n\nThe final step is to compute the ratio of the maximum norm to the minimum norm.\n\n*   **Maximum Norm:** ≈ 0.242536\n*   **Minimum Norm:** ≈ 0.038477\n\n**Ratio** = Maximum Norm / Minimum Norm ≈ 0.242536 / 0.038477 ≈ 6.3034\n\n<<<6.3034>>>"
