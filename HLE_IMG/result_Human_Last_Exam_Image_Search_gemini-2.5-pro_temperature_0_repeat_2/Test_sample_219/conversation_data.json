    "Based on the visual analysis of the provided graph, the synchronized bursts, which appear as dense vertical bands of neural activity, occur at the following approximate timestamps:\n*   Burst 1: 3 s\n*   Burst 2: 17 s\n*   Burst 3: 36 s\n*   Burst 4: 49 s\n\nThe inter-burst intervals (the time between consecutive bursts) are calculated as follows:\n*   Interval 1: 17 s - 3 s = 14 s\n*   Interval 2: 36 s - 17 s = 19 s\n*   Interval 3: 49 s - 36 s = 13 s\n\nThe average inter-burst interval is the mean of these values:\nAverage IBI = (14 + 19 + 13) / 3 = 46 / 3 â‰ˆ 15.33 s\n\nRounding this to two significant figures gives 15 s.\n\n<<<15>>>"
