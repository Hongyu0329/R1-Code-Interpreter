    "The town in the image is Arlington.\n\nThis was determined by identifying key features in the photograph, including the distinctive white grain elevator with a rusty top and an external chute, located next to a railroad crossing. A nearby green building also served as a visual marker.\n\nThe population of Arlington is over 1,000 inhabitants. According to the 2010 census, the population was 1,243. More recent estimates from 2023 and 2025 place the population at approximately 1,315 to 1,437 residents. The town's history is closely tied to the railroad and agriculture, with a grain elevator being one of the first structures built in 1870.\n\n<<<Arlington>>>"
