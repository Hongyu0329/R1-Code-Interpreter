    "The species that definitively indicates this photo was taken on the Atlantic Coast is the common periwinkle, *Littorina littorea*.\n\nSeveral species are visible in the image, including barnacles, and at least two types of snails.\n\n*   **Common Periwinkle (*Littorina littorea*)**: The larger snail with the brownish, faintly striped, conical shell is the common periwinkle. This species is native to the northeastern Atlantic coasts of Europe and was introduced to the Atlantic coast of North America in the 19th century. It is now widespread and abundant on the North American Atlantic coast from Labrador, Canada, to New Jersey, USA, but it is not established on the Pacific Coast. Its presence is therefore a clear indicator of an Atlantic location.\n*   **Atlantic Dog Whelk (*Nucella lapillus*)**: The other whitish, similarly sized snail is likely an Atlantic dog whelk. This species is also native to the North Atlantic, found on the coasts of Europe and North America, but not in the Pacific. The shell shape and color can be highly variable depending on location and environmental factors.\n*   **Northern Rock Barnacle (*Semibalanus balanoides*)**: The numerous barnacles are likely the common northern rock barnacle. This species is found on both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of North America, so its presence is not a distinguishing feature.\n\nBecause *Littorina littorea* is clearly identifiable and its range in North America is restricted to the Atlantic coast, its presence confirms the photograph's origin.\n\n<<<Littorina littorea>>>"
