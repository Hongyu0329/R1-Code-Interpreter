    "The animal depicted in the center of the image is the small milkweed bug. Its scientific name is *Lygaeus kalmii*.\n\nThis insect is a species of seed bug belonging to the family Lygaeidae and is commonly found in Central and North America. Adults are characterized by their orange to red and black coloring, reaching a length of 10 to 12 mm. A key identifying feature is the black heart shape on its back, set within a reddish-orange \"X\" pattern. The head is black with a red spot in the center.\n\nThere are two recognized subspecies: *Lygaeus kalmii angustomarginatus* (the eastern small milkweed bug) and *Lygaeus kalmii kalmii* (the western small milkweed bug). While they are often found on milkweed, where they lay their eggs, they also visit other plants like the goldenrod pictured in the image.\n\n<<<Lygaeus kalmii>>>"
