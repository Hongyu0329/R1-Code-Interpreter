    "To calculate the percentage reduction in Car VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled), we first need to calculate the total Car VMT for both the Baseline and Proposed scenarios. The VMT is calculated by taking a weighted average of the mileage for each trip category.\n\nThe formula for the weighted VMT index is:\n`VMT Index = Σ (Share of total trips * Share of car trips * Average trip distance)` for each distance category.\n\n### 1. Calculate Baseline Car VMT\n\nFirst, we calculate the total share of car trips (1 occupant + more than 2 occupants) for each distance category in the Baseline scenario (Table 1).\n\n*   **0-3 miles:** 25% + 28% = 53%\n*   **3-5 miles:** 38% + 43% = 81%\n*   **5-10 miles:** 40% + 45% = 85%\n*   **10+ miles:** 42% + 47% = 89%\n\nNext, we calculate the VMT index for the Baseline scenario by multiplying the share of total trips, the total share of car trips, and the average trip distance for each segment.\n\n*   **0-3 miles:** 0.48 (share of total trips) * 0.53 (car share) * 1 (avg distance) = 0.2544\n*   **3-5 miles:** 0.22 * 0.81 * 4 = 0.7128\n*   **5-10 miles:** 0.14 * 0.85 * 7.5 = 0.8925\n*   **10+ miles:** 0.16 * 0.89 * 20 = 2.8480\n\n**Total Baseline VMT Index = 0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = 4.7077**\n\n### 2. Calculate Proposed Car VMT\n\nNow, we repeat the process for the Proposed scenario (Table 2). First, we calculate the total share of car trips.\n\n*   **0-3 miles:** 1% + 2% = 3%\n*   **3-5 miles:** 8% + 19% = 27%\n*   **5-10 miles:** 14% + 27% = 41%\n*   **10+ miles:** 16% + 33% = 49%\n\nNext, we calculate the VMT index for the Proposed scenario.\n\n*   **0-3 miles:** 0.48 * 0.03 * 1 = 0.0144\n*   **3-5 miles:** 0.22 * 0.27 * 4 = 0.2376\n*   **5-10 miles:** 0.14 * 0.41 * 7.5 = 0.4305\n*   **10+ miles:** 0.16 * 0.49 * 20 = 1.5680\n\n**Total Proposed VMT Index = 0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = 2.2505**\n\n### 3. Calculate the Percentage Reduction\n\nFinally, we calculate the percentage reduction in Car VMT.\n\n*   **VMT Reduction** = Baseline VMT - Proposed VMT = 4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572\n*   **Percentage Reduction** = (VMT Reduction / Baseline VMT) * 100\n*   **Percentage Reduction** = (2.4572 / 4.7077) * 100 ≈ 52.195%\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the reduction is 52.2%.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
