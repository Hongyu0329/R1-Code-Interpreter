    "The chemical transformation shown is the acid-catalyzed backbone rearrangement of a pentacyclic triterpenoid. The starting material is friedelan-3Î²-ol, and the product is olean-12-ene. This reaction proceeds through a complex series of hydride and methyl shifts.\n\nThe mechanism is initiated by the protonation of the hydroxyl group by the acid catalyst (HCl), followed by the loss of a water molecule to form a secondary carbocation at the C-3 position. This carbocation then undergoes a cascade of rearrangements, known as a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, to form a more stable structure. This \"backbone rearrangement\" involves a sequence of seven shifts of methyl groups and hydrogen atoms, ultimately moving the positive charge through the carbon skeleton to the C-12 position. A final deprotonation from C-13 yields the stable alkene product, olean-12-ene.\n\nTo determine the substituents at the numbered positions in the final product, we must compare the structure of olean-12-ene with the numbered positions in the provided image.\n\n*   **Position 1:** This corresponds to the methyl group at C-4 (specifically, C-23 in standard nomenclature) of the oleanane skeleton. Therefore, the substituent is CH3.\n*   **Position 2:** This corresponds to the methyl group at C-10 (C-25) of the oleanane skeleton. The substituent is CH3.\n*   **Position 3:** This corresponds to the hydrogen atom at C-8 of the oleanane skeleton. The substituent is H.\n*   **Position 4:** This corresponds to the methyl group at C-14 (C-27) of the oleanane skeleton. The substituent is CH3.\n*   **Position 5:** This corresponds to the hydrogen atom at C-18 of the oleanane skeleton. The substituent is H.\n\nTherefore, the substituents at the indicated positions are:\n1 = CH3, 2 = CH3, 3 = H, 4 = CH3, 5 = H\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = CH3, 3 = H, 4 = CH3, 5 = H>>>"
