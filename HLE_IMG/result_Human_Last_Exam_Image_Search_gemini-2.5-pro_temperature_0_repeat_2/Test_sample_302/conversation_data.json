    "The characters on the seal are 万寿无疆 (wàn shòu wú jiāng).\n\nThe seal is read from top to bottom, right to left. The script is a form of traditional Chinese calligraphy known as seal script (篆书, zhuànshū). The four characters are:\n*   **Top right:** 萬 (wàn) - ten thousand\n*   **Bottom right:** 壽 (shòu) - longevity\n*   **Top left:** 無 (wú) - without, limitless\n*   **Bottom left:** 疆 (jiāng) - border, boundary\n\nWhen combined, they form the idiom 萬壽無疆 (wàn shòu wú jiāng), which is a traditional blessing that means \"boundless longevity\" or \"may you live a long life\".\n\nIn simplified Chinese, the phrase is written as 万寿无疆. This phrase has a long history in China and is often found on decorative arts, such as porcelain, intended to wish the owner a long life.\n\n<<<万寿无疆>>>"
