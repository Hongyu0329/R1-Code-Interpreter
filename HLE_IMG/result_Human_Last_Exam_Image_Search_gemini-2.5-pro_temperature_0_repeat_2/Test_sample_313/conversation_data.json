    "The X Y is **Golden Goblet**.\n\nThis is deduced from the two clues provided:\n\n1.  **The Image:** The photograph shows Iranian actor Hamed Behdad receiving the Best Actor award at the 22nd Shanghai International Film Festival (SIFF). The festival took place from June 15 to June 24, 2019, which aligns with the date mentioned in the prompt. The award given at this festival is the prestigious \"Golden Goblet Award\". The man presenting the award is Turkish director Nuri Bilge Ceylan, who was the jury president for the 2019 festival.\n\n2.  **The Mercury Connection:** A \"golden goblet\" can also refer to a gilded drinking cup. Historically, the process of applying gold to metal objects like goblets was often done through a method called fire-gilding or mercury-gilding. This technique involved creating a gold-mercury amalgam that was applied to the object, which was then heated to vaporize the highly toxic mercury, leaving the gold bonded to the surface. Due to the severe health risks and dangers of mercury poisoning for the artisans, this process has been almost entirely abandoned and replaced by safer methods like electroplating.\n\nTherefore, \"Golden Goblet\" is the correct answer as it fits both the description of the film award in the picture and the historical object whose creation involved a now-disused toxic mercury process.\n\n<<<Golden Goblet>>>"
