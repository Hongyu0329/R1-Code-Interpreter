    "The knot depicted in the image is known in knot theory as the 9₄₂ knot. The Jones polynomial, denoted as V(t), for this knot is:\n\nt⁻¹² - t⁻¹¹ + t⁻¹⁰ - t⁻⁹ + t⁻⁸ - t⁻⁷ + t⁻⁶\n\nIt is noteworthy that the 9₄₂ knot is one of the first examples of a non-amphichiral knot, meaning it is not equivalent to its mirror image, for which the standard Jones polynomial and other similar polynomial invariants fail to detect this property.\n\n<<<t⁻¹² - t⁻¹¹ + t⁻¹⁰ - t⁻⁹ + t⁻⁸ - t⁻⁷ + t⁻⁶>>>"
