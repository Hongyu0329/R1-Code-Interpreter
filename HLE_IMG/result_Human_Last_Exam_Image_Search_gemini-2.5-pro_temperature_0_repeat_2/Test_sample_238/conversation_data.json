    "The black organism in the photo is a slime mold named ***Comatricha nigra***.\n\nAlthough they resemble fungi, slime molds are not true fungi but belong to the kingdom Protozoa. They are amoeba-like organisms that feed on bacteria, yeasts, and other microbes found on decaying organic matter.\n\nThe organism in the image displays the characteristic features of *Comatricha nigra*: long, black, hair-like stalks that are two to six times the length of the spore-containing head, known as a sporangium. As it matures, the sporangium undergoes a color transformation, starting as translucent white, then changing to pink or red, and finally becoming black. The various stages of this color change can sometimes be seen within a single colony. This species is common and widespread, typically found on decaying wood, which is the habitat of the larger bracket fungus it is growing on in the photo.\n\n<<<Comatricha nigra>>>"
