    "### 4th Century B.C.\n\nArchaeologists attribute the gold medallion, which depicts two Scythian men, to the 4th century B.C. This artifact was discovered in the Kul-Oba kurgan, a Scythian royal burial mound near Kerch in Crimea.\n\nThe Kul-Oba kurgan, excavated in 1830, yielded a significant number of precious objects that showcase a blend of Greek and Scythian artistic styles. The tomb itself is believed to have been constructed between 400 and 350 B.C. The artifacts unearthed, including the medallion, are now housed in the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg.\n\nThe medallion features a distinctive Scythian artistic motif of two figures with their foreheads and noses pressed together, creating the illusion of a single, frontal face with two bodies. This particular style, along with other items found in the burial, firmly places the object within the artistic and cultural context of the Scythians during the 4th century B.C. The figures are depicted sharing a drinking horn, a ritual of sworn brotherhood described by the ancient Greek historian Herodotus.\n\n<<<4th Century B.C.>>>"
