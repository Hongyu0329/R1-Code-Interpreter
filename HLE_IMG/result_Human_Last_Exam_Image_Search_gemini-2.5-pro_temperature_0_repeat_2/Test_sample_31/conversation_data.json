    "The knot in the picture is the 9_42 knot. Its Rasmussen invariant, often denoted as s(K), is 0.\n\nThe Rasmussen invariant is a modern knot invariant derived from Khovanov homology. It provides valuable information about the knot's properties, including a lower bound for its slice genus. For alternating knots, the Rasmussen invariant is equal to the knot's signature. However, 9_42 is a non-alternating knot.\n\nThe knot 9_42 is notable in knot theory because its chirality (whether it is distinct from its mirror image) is not detected by many common polynomial invariants, such as the Jones, HOMFLY, and Kauffman polynomials. However, its chirality can be established using other methods, such as generalized knot invariants from Chern-Simons theory. The signature of the 9_42 knot is 2, which also confirms its chirality.\n\n<<<0>>>"
