    "The product advertised with the slogan \"Women are winning the War - of Freedom\" was Tampax.\n\nThis 1942 advertisement promoted internal sanitary protection, a revolutionary product at the time. It allowed women who were newly recruited into factory work and other essential roles to continue their duties without interruption during their periods. This was framed as helping them overcome a limitation, thereby empowering them and aiding the war effort.\n\nWhile the name \"Tampax\" itself is not French-derived, the advertisement in question was part of a broader campaign that included various products aimed at women, and sometimes different brands used similar patriotic themes. Another prominent brand for women at the time with a French name was the cosmetics company Bourjois, which also ran advertisements encouraging women to maintain their morale and appearance as part of their patriotic duty. However, the specific ad featuring the \"Women are winning the War - of Freedom\" headline was for Tampax.\n\n<<<Tampax>>>"
