    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the provided spectroscopic data to determine the structure and IUPAC name of the unknown compound.\n\n### 1. Mass Spectrometry (MS)\n*   The mass spectrum shows a molecular ion peak (M⁺) at **m/z = 135**.\n*   According to the **Nitrogen Rule**, a compound with an odd molecular weight typically contains an odd number of nitrogen atoms. This suggests the presence of at least one nitrogen atom.\n\n### 2. Elemental Formula and Degree of Unsaturation\n*   Assuming one nitrogen atom (mass ≈ 14), the remaining mass is 135 - 14 = 121.\n*   Dividing the remaining mass by the mass of carbon (12) gives 121 / 12 ≈ 10. Let's test the formula C₉H₁₃N.\n*   Mass of C₉H₁₃N = (9 × 12.01) + (13 × 1.01) + (1 × 14.01) = 108.09 + 13.13 + 14.01 = 135.23. This matches the molecular ion peak.\n*   The **Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)** is calculated as: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2) + (N/2) = 9 + 1 - (13/2) + (1/2) = 10 - 6 = 4.\n*   A DoU of 4 is characteristic of a benzene ring.\n\n### 3. Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy\n*   **~3400-3300 cm⁻¹:** Two sharp peaks are visible, which is a classic indicator of a **primary amine (-NH₂) group** (N-H symmetric and asymmetric stretching).\n*   **~3100-3000 cm⁻¹:** Peaks corresponding to sp² C-H stretching, confirming the presence of an **aromatic ring**.\n*   **<3000 cm⁻¹:** Peaks corresponding to sp³ C-H stretching, indicating an **aliphatic** portion of the molecule.\n*   **~1600-1450 cm⁻¹:** Peaks for C=C stretching within the aromatic ring.\n\n### 4. ¹³C NMR and DEPT-135 Spectroscopy\n*   **¹³C Chemical Shifts (ppm):** 145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3, 49.6, 43.5, 19.2.\n*   There are a total of 7 carbon signals for a molecule with 9 carbons, implying some symmetry.\n*   **Aromatic Region (100-150 ppm):** Four signals (145.1, 128.5, 127.3, 126.3) are present, which is consistent with a **monosubstituted benzene ring** (one quaternary ipso-carbon and three pairs of equivalent ortho/meta carbons, plus the para carbon). The signal at 145.1 ppm is the ipso-carbon.\n*   **Aliphatic Region (<100 ppm):** Three signals (49.6, 43.5, 19.2) correspond to the three carbons of the propyl side chain.\n*   **DEPT-135:** This experiment distinguishes carbon types.\n    *   Positive signals: CH, CH₃\n    *   Negative signals: CH₂\n    *   Absent signals: Quaternary C\n*   The data indicates **one negative signal (one CH₂ group)** and **five positive signals**.\n*   The five positive signals consist of the three CH groups from the benzene ring and two aliphatic carbons, which must be CH and/or CH₃ groups.\n*   Therefore, the C₃ side chain is composed of one **CH₂** group, one **CH** group, and one **CH₃** group.\n\n### 5. ¹H NMR and HSQC Spectroscopy\n*   **¹H NMR Signals:**\n    *   **~7.2 ppm (multiplet, 5H):** Confirms the **monosubstituted phenyl group (C₆H₅-)**.\n    *   **~3.1 ppm (multiplet, 1H):** A single proton in the aliphatic chain.\n    *   **~2.8 ppm (multiplet, 2H):** Two protons in the aliphatic chain.\n    *   **~1.2 ppm (doublet, 3H):** A methyl group coupled to a single proton.\n*   **HSQC Analysis:** This 2D spectrum correlates protons with the carbons they are directly attached to.\n    *   The ¹H signal at **1.2 ppm** correlates with the ¹³C signal at **19.2 ppm**. This assigns the upfield carbon as the **CH₃** group.\n    *   The ¹H signal at **2.8 ppm (2H)** correlates with the ¹³C signal at **43.5 ppm**. This identifies the **CH₂** group.\n    *   The ¹H signal at **3.1 ppm (1H)** correlates with the ¹³C signal at **49.6 ppm**. This identifies the **CH** group.\n\n### 6. Structure Elucidation and IUPAC Name\nBased on the fragments identified: a phenyl group (C₆H₅-), a primary amine (-NH₂), and a propyl chain with CH, CH₂, and CH₃ units. We can assemble the structure.\n\nThe data points to a `C₆H₅-CH₂-CH-CH₃` skeleton with an -NH₂ group. The question is the location of the amine.\n\n*   **Structure A: 1-Phenylpropan-2-amine** (Amphetamine)\n    `C₆H₅-CH₂(a)-CH(b)(NH₂)-CH₃(c)`\n    *   The benzylic carbon (a) is a CH₂ group. Its chemical shift is 43.5 ppm.\n    *   The carbon attached to the nitrogen (b) is a CH group. Its chemical shift is 49.6 ppm.\n    *   The methyl carbon (c) is at 19.2 ppm.\n    *   This assignment is chemically sound. The carbon attached to the electronegative nitrogen (CH) is the most downfield of the aliphatic carbons. The benzylic CH₂ is next, followed by the methyl group.\n\n*   **Structure B: 2-Phenylpropan-1-amine**\n    `C₆H₅-CH(a)(CH₃(c))-CH₂(b)-NH₂`\n    *   The benzylic carbon (a) is a CH group.\n    *   The carbon attached to the nitrogen (b) is a CH₂ group.\n    *   This contradicts the HSQC data, which assigned the CH group to the carbon at 49.6 ppm and the CH₂ group to the carbon at 43.5 ppm.\n\nAll evidence consistently points to the structure being 1-phenylpropan-2-amine.\n\n**Final Structure:**\n```\n      NH₂\n      |\nC₆H₅-CH₂-CH-CH₃\n```\n\n**IUPAC Name:** 1-Phenylpropan-2-amine\n\n<<<1-Phenylpropan-2-amine>>>"
