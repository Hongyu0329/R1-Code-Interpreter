    "This is the crystal structure of a Ube2S-ubiquitin conjugate. The image corresponds to the Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 5BNB.\n\n**Details about the protein:**\n\n*   **UBE2S (Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 S):** This enzyme plays a crucial role in protein ubiquitination, a process that attaches ubiquitin proteins to other proteins. Specifically, UBE2S is known to catalyze the formation of 'Lys-11'-linked polyubiquitin chains.\n*   **Function:** It is an essential component of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), which is a ubiquitin ligase that regulates the progression of the cell cycle through mitosis. By working with the APC/C, UBE2S helps tag mitotic regulators for degradation by the proteasome.\n*   **Structure:** The image shows a covalent complex between Ube2S (in dark blue) and a ubiquitin molecule (in light blue). This represents an intermediate step in the ubiquitination reaction where the ubiquitin is thioester-bound to the active site cysteine of UBE2S. The structure shown is important for understanding the specific interactions that allow for the formation of Lys-11 linkages.\n\nIn summary, the image displays the Ube2S enzyme in a complex with ubiquitin, providing a snapshot of the mechanism by which it functions in the cell cycle.\n\n<<<Ube2S-ubiquitin conjugate>>>"
