    "The figure leaving the chariot is the sorceress Medea, a princess from the mythical land of Colchis.\n\nThis South Italian red-figure vase depicts the dramatic climax of the tragedy *Medea* by the ancient Greek playwright Euripides. In a fit of vengeful fury against her unfaithful husband, Jason, Medea has murdered their two children. The scene captures her escape from Corinth.\n\nMedea is shown in the chariot, identifiable by her ornate, Eastern-style clothing, including a distinctive headdress and patterned sleeves, which signify her foreign origins. She is actively driving the chariot, which, according to the myth, was a golden chariot sent by her grandfather, the sun god Helios, and was often depicted as being drawn by winged dragons or serpents. The figure lying on the ground beneath the chariot is one of her murdered sons. The entire composition illustrates Medea's dramatic and divinely-aided departure after her horrific acts of revenge.\n\nVase paintings of this scene were popular in the Greek colonies of Southern Italy, where there was a great appreciation for Athenian drama.\n\n<<<Medea>>>"
