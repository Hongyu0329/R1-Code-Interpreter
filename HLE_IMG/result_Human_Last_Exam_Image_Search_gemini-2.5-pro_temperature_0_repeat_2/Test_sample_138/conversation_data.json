    "Based on the visual evidence and biological characteristics of the insects shown, the sexes for each pair are determined as follows:\n\n*   **Pair A:** The insect on the left is a *Coelioxys* bee, identifiable by its sharply pointed, conical abdomen, which is a characteristic feature of females of this genus. The insect on the right is a *Triepeolus* cuckoo bee. While sex determination can be difficult without microscopic examination, the overall robust body shape and the appearance of a silvery patch at the end of the abdomen (pygidial plate) are indicative of a female. Therefore, this pair is Female, Female.\n*   **Pair B:** These are *Polistes* paper wasps. The individual on the left exhibits classic male characteristics: long antennae with curled tips and a predominantly yellow face. The wasp on the right has shorter, straight antennae and more black markings on its face, which are typical features of a female. Therefore, this pair is Male, Female.\n*   **Pair C:** The bee on the left is a long-horned bee, likely from the genus *Melissodes*. The exceptionally long antennae and yellow facial markings are definitive traits of a male. The bee on the right is a leafcutter bee (*Megachile*). Female leafcutter bees fit the prompt's description of lacking scopae (pollen-collecting hairs) on their legs, as they instead have an abdominal scopa for pollen transport. The bee's robust build and short antennae are consistent with it being a female. Therefore, this pair is Male, Female.\n\nThe resulting indices for pairs A, B, and C are 2, 3, and 3.\n\n2, 3, 3"
