    "Based on the recurring annual peaks in the Google Trends graph, the country in question is the **United States**. The three historic events correspond to significant American historical commemorations.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the evidence from the graph:\n\n*   **The Red Line:** This line shows consistent, sharp peaks in early December of each year. This corresponds to **Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day**, which is observed annually in the U.S. on December 7th to remember the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor.\n*   **The Yellow Line:** This line has its highest recurring peaks at the end of May each year. This timing aligns with **Memorial Day**, a U.S. federal holiday observed on the last Monday of May to honor military personnel who died in service. The prominent, anomalous peak in late August 2021, marked with a \"Note,\" corresponds to the U.S. troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, which concluded on August 30, 2021. This major news event likely triggered searches for related military topics.\n*   **The Blue Line:** This line shows smaller, but consistent, annual peaks in early June. This corresponds with the anniversary of **D-Day**, the Allied invasion of Normandy on June 6, 1944. While a multinational effort, D-Day is a profoundly significant event in U.S. history, and its anniversary is widely commemorated.\n\nThe combination of these three specific annual commemorations—Memorial Day, Pearl Harbor Day, and D-Day—is unique to the historical consciousness and calendar of the United States.\n\n<<<United States>>>"
