    "The reaction scheme involves three sequential transformations to arrive at the final product. To determine the molecular formula of the product, each step will be analyzed to track the changes in the atomic composition.\n\n**Step 1: Deprotection of the starting material**\n\nThe initial reaction involves treating the starting material, 2-(4-methoxybenzyl)-6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one, with ceric ammonium nitrate (CAN) in a mixture of acetonitrile (ACN) and water. CAN is a common reagent used for the oxidative deprotection of para-methoxybenzyl (PMB) ethers and amines. In this step, the PMB group (C8H9O) is cleaved from the nitrogen atom and replaced with a hydrogen atom, yielding Intermediate 1.\n\n*   **Starting Material Formula:** C15H14F3NO2\n*   **Change:** - C8H9O (PMB group) + H\n*   **Intermediate 1 Formula:** C7H6F3NO\n\n**Step 2: Hydrogenation of Intermediate 1**\n\nIntermediate 1 is then subjected to catalytic hydrogenation with hydrogen gas (H2) and palladium on carbon (Pd/C) in methanol (MeOH). This reaction reduces the carbon-carbon double bond within the bicyclic ring system. Two hydrogen atoms are added across the double bond, saturating the ring and forming Intermediate 2.\n\n*   **Intermediate 1 Formula:** C7H6F3NO\n*   **Change:** + H2\n*   **Intermediate 2 Formula:** C7H8F3NO\n\n**Step 3: Hydrolysis of Intermediate 2**\n\nThe final step is the hydrolysis of Intermediate 2, which is a cyclic amide (lactam), using 4 N hydrochloric acid (HCl) at 70 Â°C. Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis cleaves the amide bond in the lactam ring. This reaction consumes one molecule of water (H2O), opening the ring to form a product containing both an amino group and a carboxylic acid group.\n\n*   **Intermediate 2 Formula:** C7H8F3NO\n*   **Change:** + H2O\n*   **Final Product Formula:** C7H10F3NO2\n\nThe final product is an amino acid derivative, specifically a substituted aminocyclopentanecarboxylic acid. The molecular formula is derived by adding the atoms of water to the formula of Intermediate 2.\n\nTherefore, the molecular formula of the final product is C7H10F3NO2.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
