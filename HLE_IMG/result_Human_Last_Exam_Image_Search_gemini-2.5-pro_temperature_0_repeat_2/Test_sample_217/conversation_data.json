    "The cuneiform sign shown in the image is Ã‰ (or E2), which means \"house\" or \"temple\" in Sumerian.\n\nThis pictographic representation dates back to the third millennium BCE. An image on a wall plaque from Ur, dated to 2500 BCE, shows a nearly identical symbol for a temple. The sign pictorially represents the layout of a building. Over millennia, this sign, like others, evolved from a more literal picture into a more abstract collection of wedge-shaped marks.\n\nOf the choices provided:\n*   **Tool:** This is a general category, but specific signs for tools do not match the image.\n*   **Guard:** The cuneiform sign for guard, `ennuÅ‹`, is different.\n*   **Bread:** The sign for bread, `ninda` (ð’ƒ»), is also different, though it can have a triangular shape in some forms.\n*   **Deity:** The sign for a deity, `dingir` (ð’€­), is a star-shaped symbol.\n*   **Beard:** The sign for beard, `suâ‚†`, does not resemble the image provided.\n\nThe sign in the image clearly corresponds to the early pictograph for \"house\" or \"temple.\"\n\n<<<D>>>"
