    "The book that has the presented fragment on its cover is \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,\" the first book in the Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling. The artwork is from the original United States edition, illustrated by Mary GrandPr√©.\n\nThe image fragment shows a white unicorn with a golden horn, which is a detail found on the right side of the full cover illustration. The cover art depicts several elements from the story, including Harry Potter on his broomstick, Hogwarts castle, and the unicorn in the Forbidden Forest. A commemorative coin by the New Zealand Mint also features this specific cover art, describing a \"galloping unicorn running towards a forest.\"\n\n<<<Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone>>>"
