    "Based on the visual evidence in the image, this photo was taken at **Richmond Beach Saltwater Park** in the city of **Shoreline, Washington**.\n\nSeveral key features in the image point to this specific location:\n*   **Beach and Bonfire:** The image shows a beach at sunset with a bonfire. Richmond Beach Saltwater Park is located on the Puget Sound and has designated fire pits for public use.\n*   **Topography and View:** The photograph is taken from an elevated viewpoint, looking down at the shoreline. This is consistent with the park's geography, which includes a bluff with walking trails above the beach.\n*   **Chain-Link Fence:** A prominent feature in the foreground is a black chain-link fence. This park has a fence that runs along the railroad tracks which are situated between the beach and the main park area/bluff. Access to the beach is via a pedestrian overpass. The perspective of the photo suggests it was taken from this elevated area near the fence, looking down onto the beach.\n\nWhile other parks in the Seattle area, like Golden Gardens, also allow beach bonfires, the specific combination of the bluff, the view, and the chain-link fence directly overlooking the beach strongly indicates that the location is Richmond Beach Saltwater Park in Shoreline.\n\n<<<Shoreline, Washington>>>"
