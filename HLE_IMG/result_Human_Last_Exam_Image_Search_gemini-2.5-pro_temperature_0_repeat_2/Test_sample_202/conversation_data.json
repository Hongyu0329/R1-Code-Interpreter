    "Based on the visual characteristics of the rock specimens and the information gathered, here is the identification of each rock:\n\n*   **H: Scoria** This rock is reddish-brown and has a highly vesicular (bubbly) texture. Scoria is a type of volcanic rock that is formed when gas-rich lava is ejected from a volcano. Its color can be black or reddish-brown.\n\n*   **I: Breccia** This specimen is composed of angular fragments of other rocks cemented together. A sedimentary rock made of angular fragments is called a breccia. If the fragments were rounded, it would be a conglomerate.\n\n*   **J: Pumice** This is a light-colored, vesicular volcanic rock. Pumice is created when super-heated, highly pressurized rock is rapidly ejected from a volcano. It is very porous and has a low density, sometimes even floating on water.\n\n*   **K: Pegmatite** This rock is characterized by its very large, interlocking crystals. Pegmatite is an igneous rock that forms from the slow crystallization of magma, which allows large crystals to grow. It is often composed of minerals like feldspar, quartz, and mica.\n\n<<<H: Scoria, I: Breccia, J: Pumice, K: Pegmatite>>>"
