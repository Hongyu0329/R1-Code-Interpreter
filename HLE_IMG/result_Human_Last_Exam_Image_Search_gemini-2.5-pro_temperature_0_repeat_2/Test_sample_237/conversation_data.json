    "Yes, there is an animal in the image. It is a longhorn beetle. Based on its appearance, it is most likely the Red-brown Longhorn Beetle, and its scientific name is *Stictoleptura rubra*.\n\nThis beetle is a member of the family Cerambycidae. The image appears to show a male of the species, which is characterized by a black head and pronotum (the segment behind the head) and brownish or pale ochre wing covers (elytra). Females of this species typically have a uniformly reddish-brown or reddish-orange body, including the pronotum and elytra.\n\n*Stictoleptura rubra* can reach a length of 10 to 20 millimeters. The larvae of this beetle develop in the dead wood and stumps of coniferous trees like pine, fir, and spruce. The adults are often seen during the summer months visiting flowers to feed on nectar and pollen. This species is found throughout Europe, Russia, and North Africa.\n\nAnother similar species is the Red-shouldered Pine Borer (*Stictoleptura canadensis*), which is found in North America. However, the beetle in the image strongly resembles the male *Stictoleptura rubra*.\n\n<<<*Stictoleptura rubra*>>>"
