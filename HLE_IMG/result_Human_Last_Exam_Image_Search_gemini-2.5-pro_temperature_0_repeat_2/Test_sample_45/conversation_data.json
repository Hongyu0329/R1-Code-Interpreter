    "The tiling in the image exhibits several rotational symmetries. By analyzing the pattern, we can identify different points around which the tiling can be rotated to appear unchanged.\n\nThe most prominent feature is the dark blue hexagon. The tiling has a **6-fold rotational symmetry** around the center of each of these hexagons. This means that if you rotate the entire pattern by 60 degrees (or any multiple of 60) around the center of a hexagon, it will look identical to the original. The presence of 6-fold rotational symmetry is the highest order of rotation in this pattern.\n\nIn addition to the 6-fold rotation, the tiling also possesses other rotational symmetries:\n*   **3-fold rotational symmetry:** These points are located at the vertices where three of the larger yellowish \"starfish\" arms meet, between three hexagons. Rotating the pattern by 120 degrees around these points leaves it unchanged.\n*   **2-fold rotational symmetry:** There are two types of centers for 2-fold rotation (a 180-degree turn). One is at the center of each yellowish square, and the other is at the midpoint of the edges shared by two hexagons.\n\nThe overall rotational symmetry of a tiling is typically defined by the highest order of rotation it possesses. For this tiling, that is 6-fold symmetry. This type of pattern is classified under the wallpaper group p6m, which is characterized by having centers of 6-fold, 3-fold, and 2-fold rotation, as well as reflection symmetries.\n\n<<<6-fold>>>"
