    "The plant in the image is *Psychotria kirkii*, commonly known as Kirk's Laurel.\n\nThis species is not endemic to a single island. Instead, it is native to a wide range of countries in tropical and southern Africa. Its distribution includes the Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda, Sudan, southern Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. While some species of the *Psychotria* genus are endemic to islands like Madagascar or the Galapagos, *Psychotria kirkii* is widespread across the African mainland. It typically grows in various types of woodland, thickets, and grasslands, often near rocks or on termite mounds.\n\n<<<Africa>>>"
