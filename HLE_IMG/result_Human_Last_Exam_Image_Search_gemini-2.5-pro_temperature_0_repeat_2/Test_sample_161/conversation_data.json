    "The reaction shown involves two main steps. The first is a Friedel-Crafts acylation, and the second is the formation of a substituted imidazole ring.\n\n1.  **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n    *   Butylbenzene reacts with 2-bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of aluminum chloride (AlCl₃), a Lewis acid catalyst.\n    *   This reaction attaches the bromoacetyl group to the benzene ring. The butyl group directs the new substituent to the *para* position due to steric hindrance at the *ortho* positions.\n    *   The product of this step is 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, which is an α-bromoketone.\n\n2.  **Step 2: Imidazole Synthesis**\n    *   The α-bromoketone, 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, reacts with an unknown reactant to form a complex imidazole derivative.\n    *   The product is *tert*-butyl (2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazol-1-yl)carbamate.\n    *   This type of reaction, forming a 2-aminoimidazole from an α-haloketone, typically involves a guanidine derivative.\n    *   Let's analyze the atoms required from the unknown reactant to form the product. The α-bromoketone provides the carbon backbone that becomes positions 4 and 5 of the imidazole ring. The unknown reactant must therefore provide the nitrogen at position 1 (N1), the carbon at position 2 (C2), the nitrogen at position 3 (N3), and the substituents attached to them.\n    *   The product has a 2-amino group (-NH₂) and a 1-(N-tert-butoxycarbonylamino) group (-NH-Boc).\n    *   This specific arrangement points to the use of a substituted aminoguanidine. The reaction of α-haloketones with aminoguanidine is a known method for synthesizing 1,2-diaminoimidazoles.\n    *   The required reactant is **N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)aminoguanidine**. Its structure is (CH₃)₃C-O-C(=O)-NH-NH-C(=NH)-NH₂. In this reaction, the terminal nitrogen of the hydrazine moiety attacks the ketone, and subsequent cyclization with the guanidine portion forms the 2-amino-1-(N-Boc-amino)imidazole ring system.\n\nTherefore, the name of the required reactant is N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)aminoguanidine.\n\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)aminoguanidine>>>"
