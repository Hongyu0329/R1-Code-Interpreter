    "To determine the longest R-R interval from the provided ECG rhythm strip, one must analyze the grid on which the heart's electrical activity is traced.\n\n**ECG Paper Analysis:**\n*   **Speed:** The ECG paper speed is noted as 25 mm/sec.\n*   **Grid:** The paper is divided into small and large squares.\n    *   Each small square is 1 mm and represents 0.04 seconds (1 mm / 25 mm/sec).\n    *   Each large square is 5 mm and represents 0.2 seconds (5 mm / 25 mm/sec).\n\n**Measurement of the Longest R-R Interval:**\n1.  Visually scanning the entire rhythm strip reveals the most significant pause, or the longest interval between two consecutive R-waves (the highest peaks of the QRS complex), occurs on the fourth line of the tracing.\n2.  To measure this interval, we count the number of squares between the peak of the R-wave just before the pause and the peak of the R-wave immediately following it.\n3.  The interval covers 8 full large squares and approximately one additional small square.\n4.  The calculation is as follows:\n    *   8 large squares = 8 * 0.2 seconds = 1.6 seconds.\n    *   1 small square = 1 * 0.04 seconds = 0.04 seconds.\n    *   Total time = 1.6 seconds + 0.04 seconds = 1.64 seconds.\n\nAlternatively, counting the total number of small squares (8 large squares * 5 small squares/large square + 1 small square = 41 small squares) and multiplying by the time per small square gives the same result (41 * 0.04 seconds = 1.64 seconds).\n\n<<<1.64>>>"
