    "The transformation involves two distinct photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions that occur in sequence.\n\n1.  **[4π] Electrocyclization:** The first reaction is the photochemical valence isomerization of hexafluorobenzene to hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene (bicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene). This process can be classified as a 4π-electron electrocyclic ring-closing reaction. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, 4nπ electrocyclic reactions (where n=1) are photochemically allowed.\n\n2.  **[2+2] Cycloaddition:** The second step is the reaction between the intermediate, hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene, and cyclobutene. This is a photochemical cycloaddition between the double bond of cyclobutene and one of the double bonds of the hexafluoro-Dewar-benzene. This reaction involves two π-electron systems (one from each molecule) combining to form a four-membered ring, and is therefore classified as a [2+2] cycloaddition. Such reactions are also photochemically allowed under the Woodward-Hoffmann rules.\n\nTherefore, the two pericyclic reactions involved are a **[4π] electrocyclization** and a **[2+2] cycloaddition**.\n\n<<<[4π] electrocyclization and [2+2] cycloaddition>>>"
