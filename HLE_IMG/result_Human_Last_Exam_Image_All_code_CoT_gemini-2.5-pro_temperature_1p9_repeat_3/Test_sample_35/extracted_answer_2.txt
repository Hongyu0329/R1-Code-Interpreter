The protein S100B binds to the extracellular V-domain of the Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts (RAGE). Due to its lack of disease specificity—being implicated in multiple neurological and cardiovascular diseases—it is better suited as an adjunct marker to assess general neuroinflammation rather than as a specific prognostic marker for a single disorder.
