    "This series of images (L, M, N) depicts the process of **septal breakdown and subsequent cytoplasmic movement** in a filamentous organism, likely a fungus.\n\nHere is a step-by-step description of the process shown:\n\n1.  **Image L:** This panel shows two healthy, adjacent cells in a filament separated by a cross-wall, known as a septum (indicated by the arrowhead).\n2.  **Image M:** The septum begins to break down. This is visible as a bulge forming at the septum (arrowhead), caused by the turgor pressure from one cell pushing against the weakening wall of the other.\n3.  **Image N:** The breakdown is complete. The septum has dissolved, allowing the cytoplasm and its contents from the lower cell to flow into the upper cell. The lower cell appears plasmolyzed or empty, while the upper cell remains full.\n\nThis process can occur for various reasons in filamentous fungi, such as response to injury (allowing the organism to salvage cytoplasm from damaged compartments) or during certain life cycle stages involving cell fusion.\n\nSince no calculation or coding is required to answer the question, I will provide the answer directly in the requested format.\n\n<<<The process shown is the breakdown of a septum between two cells in a filament, leading to the fusion of their cytoplasm.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
