    "The plant in the image is a type of leafy liverwort. I can identify it by its very distinct morphology. The leaves are densely packed and arranged in three rows along the stem. This specific arrangement causes the shoots to have a characteristic braided, cord-like, or screw-like appearance. This unique growth form is a hallmark of the genus *Herbertus*.\n\nHere is a Python script to provide the answer.\n\n```python\ndef get_plant_genus():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies and returns the scientific genus of the plant shown in the image.\n  The plant is a bryophyte, specifically a leafy liverwort, recognized by its distinctive\n  braided or screw-like appearance due to the tight, spiral arrangement of its leaves.\n  \"\"\"\n  genus_name = \"Herbertus\"\n  print(genus_name)\n\nget_plant_genus()\n```\n<<<Herbertus>>>"
