    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the substituents at the indicated positions.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reaction type and key features.**\nThe reaction shown is the acid-catalyzed dehydration of a tetracyclic triterpenoid alcohol. The conditions (catalytic HCl, 110 Â°C) are typical for an E1 elimination, which proceeds via a carbocation intermediate. The prompt explicitly states that the reaction involves a number of [1,2] shifts. This points to a carbocation rearrangement, specifically the well-known Wagner-Meerwein \"backbone rearrangement\" common in steroid and terpenoid chemistry. This rearrangement involves a cascade of [1,2]-hydride and [1,2]-methyl shifts along the fused ring system.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the starting material's structure and the migrating groups.**\nThe starting material is a tetracyclic triterpene with a C3-hydroxyl group and a standard saturated side chain. We need to identify the substituents at the key ring junction positions that will participate in the rearrangement. Based on the standard structure of dammarane-type triterpenes and the provided drawing:\n*   At the C-4 position, there is a gem-dimethyl group. As we will see, these are typically not involved in the main backbone rearrangement.\n*   At the C-10 position (A/B ring junction), there is a **CH3** group (usually beta-oriented).\n*   At the C-9 position (B/C ring junction), there is an **H** atom (usually alpha-oriented).\n*   At the C-8 position (B/C ring junction), there is a **CH3** group (usually beta-oriented).\n*   At the C-13 position (C/D ring junction), the drawing shows an **H** atom (alpha-oriented).\n*   At the C-14 position (C/D ring junction), there is a **CH3** group (usually beta-oriented).\n\n**Step 3: Trace the sequence of [1,2] shifts in the backbone rearrangement.**\nThe rearrangement is a cascade (\"zipper\") reaction where a positive charge migrates along the backbone, and substituents shift into the newly formed cationic center. While the initiation at C-3 is complex, the subsequent cascade of shifts follows a well-established pattern. Let's trace the movement of the groups:\n\n1.  A carbocation is formed (e.g., at C-5 or C-10) which initiates the cascade.\n2.  The **CH3** group from C-10 migrates to the adjacent position (C-5), leaving a carbocation at C-10.\n3.  The **H** atom from C-9 migrates to the C-10 carbocation, transferring the positive charge to C-9.\n4.  The **CH3** group from C-8 migrates to the C-9 carbocation, transferring the positive charge to C-8.\n5.  The **H** atom from C-13 migrates to the C-8 carbocation, transferring the positive charge to C-13.\n6.  The **CH3** group from C-14 migrates to the C-13 carbocation, transferring the positive charge to C-14.\n\nThe cascade typically terminates when a stable tertiary carbocation is formed, which then undergoes elimination (loss of a proton) to form a stable alkene.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the identity of the new substituent at each key position.**\nBased on the shifts described in Step 3, let's see what substituent ends up at each of the original positions:\n*   The original C-5 position now bears the **CH3** group that migrated from C-10.\n*   The original C-10 position now bears the **H** atom that migrated from C-9.\n*   The original C-8 position now bears the **H** atom that migrated from C-13.\n*   The original C-13 position now bears the **CH3** group that migrated from C-14.\n*   The gem-dimethyl group at C-4 is unaffected.\n\n**Step 5: Map the numbered positions in the product to the carbon skeleton and determine the final substituents.**\nWe map the numbered labels in the product structure to the corresponding carbons in the reactant skeleton. The overall shape of the rings helps in this mapping.\n\n*   **Position 1:** Located on the carbon with a gem-dimethyl group, which corresponds to C-4 of the reactant. This group did not migrate.\n    *   **1 = CH3**\n*   **Position 2:** Located at the A/B ring junction, corresponding to C-10. After the rearrangement, this position is occupied by an H atom (from C-9).\n    *   **2 = H**\n*   **Position 3:** Located at the A/B ring junction, corresponding to C-5. After the rearrangement, this position is occupied by a CH3 group (from C-10).\n    *   **3 = CH3**\n*   **Position 4:** Located at the B/C ring junction, corresponding to C-8. After the rearrangement, this position is occupied by an H atom (from C-13).\n    *   **4 = H**\n*   **Position 5:** Located at the C/D ring junction, corresponding to C-13. After the rearrangement, this position is occupied by a CH3 group (from C-14).\n    *   **5 = CH3**\n\nFinal Answer Formulation:\nCombining these findings, we get:\n1 = CH3\n2 = H\n3 = CH3\n4 = H\n5 = CH3\n\n<<<1 = CH3, 2 = H, 3 = CH3, 4 = H, 5 = CH3>>>"
