The protein S100B exhibits a strong affinity for the V-domain (variable immunoglobulin-like domain) of the RAGE receptor, as depicted in the diagram where S100B directly contacts this specific extracellular domain.

S100B could be used as a **prognostic marker** rather than solely an adjunct marker. The reasoning is that the downstream effects of S100B binding to RAGE directly drive the pathology of neurological disorders. As shown in the pathway, increased S100B activity leads to apoptosis (via the JNK/JUN pathway) and promotes neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and neurodegeneration (via the NF-ÎºB pathway). Since the concentration of S100B directly correlates with the severity of these pathological processes, its level can predict the future course and outcome of the disease, which is the definition of a prognostic marker.
