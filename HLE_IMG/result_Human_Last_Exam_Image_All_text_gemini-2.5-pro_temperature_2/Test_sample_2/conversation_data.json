    "An analysis of the provided sorting algorithm to determine its worst-case time complexity.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Algorithm's Structure:**\n    The function `sort(a, n)` is a recursive function. Let's break down its actions when called for a given array `a` and size `n`.\n    -   `if n > 1:`: The base case for the recursion is when `n <= 1`. An array of size 1 or 0 is already considered sorted.\n    -   `sort(a, n - 1)`: The first step is a recursive call to sort the subarray consisting of the first `n-1` elements (i.e., `a[0]` to `a[n-2]`).\n    -   `if a[n - 1] < a[n - 2]:`: After the first `n-1` elements are sorted, the element `a[n-2]` is the largest among them. This line compares the `n`-th element (`a[n-1]`) with the largest element of the sorted prefix.\n    -   `swap(a[n-1], a[n - 2])`: If the `n`-th element is smaller, it's swapped with `a[n-2]`. This places the larger of the two elements at the end of the `n`-element subarray, but it may disrupt the sorted order of the `n-1` element prefix. For example, if the prefix was `[1, 5]` and the `n`-th element was `2`, after the swap the prefix becomes `[1, 2]`, which is still sorted. But if the prefix was `[3, 4]` and the `n`-th element was `2`, after swapping `2` and `4`, the prefix becomes `[3, 2]`, which is now unsorted.\n    -   `sort(a, n - 1)`: Because the previous swap might have unsorted the prefix of `n-1` elements, this second recursive call is made to sort that prefix again.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Recurrence Relation:**\n    Let `T(n)` be the time taken by the `sort` function for an input of size `n`.\n    -   The base case is `T(1)`, which takes a constant amount of time, `O(1)`.\n    -   For `n > 1`, the time taken is the sum of the times of its sub-operations:\n        -   The first call `sort(a, n - 1)` takes `T(n - 1)`.\n        -   The comparison `if a[n-1] < a[n-2]` and the potential `swap` take constant time, `O(1)`.\n        -   The second call `sort(a, n - 1)` takes `T(n - 1)`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Worst-Case Scenario:**\n    The worst case occurs when the algorithm performs the maximum amount of work. This happens when the `if` condition (`a[n-1] < a[n-2]`) is always true after the first recursive call, which triggers the second `sort(a, n - 1)` call at every level of recursion. An example of an input that causes this behavior is a reverse-sorted array (e.g., `[n, n-1, ..., 2, 1]`).\n\n    In the worst case, the recurrence relation becomes:\n    `T(n) = T(n - 1) + O(1) + T(n - 1)`\n    `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c` (where `c` is a constant)\n\n4.  **Solve the Recurrence Relation:**\n    We can solve `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c` using the expansion method:\n    -   `T(n) = 2 * T(n - 1) + c`\n    -   `T(n) = 2 * (2 * T(n - 2) + c) + c = 2^2 * T(n - 2) + 2c + c`\n    -   `T(n) = 2^2 * (2 * T(n - 3) + c) + 2c + c = 2^3 * T(n - 3) + 4c + 2c + c`\n    -   `...`\n    -   `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * T(1) + c * (2^(n-2) + 2^(n-3) + ... + 2^1 + 2^0)`\n\n    The sum `2^0 + 2^1 + ... + 2^(n-2)` is a geometric series which equals `2^(n-1) - 1`.\n    Since `T(1)` is a constant, let's call it `c'`.\n    -   `T(n) = 2^(n-1) * c' + c * (2^(n-1) - 1)`\n    -   `T(n) = c' * 2^(n-1) + c * 2^(n-1) - c`\n    -   `T(n) = (c' + c) * 2^(n-1) - c`\n\n    The dominant term in this expression is `2^(n-1)`. In Big O notation, this is `O(2^n)`.\n\n5.  **Termination:**\n    The algorithm always terminates because the recursive calls are made with a smaller size `n-1`, which will eventually reach the base case `n <= 1`. So, option F is incorrect.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    The worst-case time complexity of this sorting algorithm is exponential. Comparing our result `O(2^n)` with the given choices:\n    A. O(n) - Incorrect. This is the best-case complexity.\n    B. O(n log n) - Incorrect.\n    C. O(n^2) - Incorrect.\n    D. O(n^3) - Incorrect.\n    E. O(2^n) - Correct.\n    F. does not terminate - Incorrect.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{E}$."
