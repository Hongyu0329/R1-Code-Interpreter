    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the piece of music from the provided sheet music.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Initial Observations:**\n    *   **Instrumentation:** The music is written on a grand staff (treble and bass clefs), which is standard for piano music.\n    *   **Time Signature:** The piece is in 4/4 time (common time), indicated by the 'C' symbol.\n    *   **Tempo:** The tempo marking is Quarter Note = 80, which is a moderate, walking pace (Andante).\n    *   **Key Signature:** The initial key signature has two sharps (F# and C#). This suggests either D major or B minor. The first chord played by the left hand is a B minor triad (B-D-F#), and the first melodic note is B, strongly indicating the key is B minor.\n    *   **Dynamics:** There is a wide range of dynamics. It starts quietly (*p* - piano), then abruptly becomes loud (*f* - forte) in measure 3. It later shifts to *mp* (mezzo-piano) and *mf* (mezzo-forte), indicating significant expressive contrast.\n\n2.  **Structural and Thematic Analysis:**\n    *   **Measures 1-2:** The piece begins with a calm, simple, and slightly melancholic melody in the right hand over arpeggiated chords in the left hand.\n    *   **Measure 3:** There is a sudden and dramatic shift. The dynamic becomes forte, and the texture becomes dense with rapid sixteenth-note movement in both hands. The right hand plays a powerful, syncopated chordal melody, while the left hand plays driving, broken sixteenth-note chords. This sharp contrast suggests a theme associated with action or conflict.\n    *   **Measures 4-6:** The sixteenth-note pattern continues, but the harmony modulates, introducing accidentals like G# and D#, creating tension.\n    *   **Measure 7:** This measure features a very fast, virtuosic run in the right hand over sustained chords, a common feature in technically demanding piano pieces.\n    *   **Measures 8-10:** The music returns to the powerful, chord-driven sixteenth-note theme from measure 3, but now with even denser chords in the left hand, amplifying the intensity.\n    *   **Measure 11:** The measure begins with dotted rhythms and then transitions into an extremely fast arpeggiated figure (a glissando-like effect) that sweeps up the keyboard.\n\n3.  **Identification:**\n    *   The style—highly virtuosic, rhythmically driving, full of dramatic contrasts, and harmonically rooted in late Romanticism but with a modern flair—is very characteristic of advanced arrangements of video game music, particularly from epic role-playing games.\n    *   The main theme starting at measure 3 is extremely recognizable. The specific rhythmic and melodic contour of the right-hand chords against the driving left-hand bass is the iconic opening riff of the boss battle theme from the video game **Final Fantasy VII**.\n    *   The original Japanese title is \"さらに闘う者たち\" (*Sarani Tatakau Monotachi*). The official English title for this theme is **\"Those Who Fight Further\"** or sometimes translated as **\"Still More Fighting\"**. The piece was composed by the legendary video game composer **Nobuo Uematsu**. The sheet music presented here is from a piano arrangement of this famous battle theme.\n\n<<<Those Who Fight Further (also known as Still More Fighting) from Final Fantasy VII>>>"
