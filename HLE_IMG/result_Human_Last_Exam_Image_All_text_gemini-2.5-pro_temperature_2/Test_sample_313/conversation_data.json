    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the answer.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue and the image.**\n*   The first clue is: \"X Y is pictured at an event on June 20, 2019.\"\n*   The image shows two men at what appears to be an awards ceremony. The man on the right, with a beard, is receiving a trophy from the older man on the left.\n*   By searching for major awards events on or around June 19-20, 2019, specifically in sports, we can identify the event as the 2019 NHL Awards.\n*   The man receiving the award is Nikita Kucherov, a star player for the Tampa Bay Lightning. He won the Hart Memorial Trophy (MVP) and the Ted Lindsay Award at this event. The man presenting is NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman.\n*   A key piece of information here is Nikita Kucherov's team: the Tampa Bay **Lightning**. This will be crucial later.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue.**\n*   The second clue is: \"Another X Y has almost ceased to be used due to the toxicity of mercury salts.\"\n*   This clue points to a historical object or process that involved mercury and is now obsolete.\n*   The most prominent example of this is the **daguerreotype**, an early form of photograph invented by Louis Daguerre. The process involved developing the image on a silver plate using hot mercury vapor, which is highly toxic. This process has been almost completely replaced by modern photography. The name can be treated as two words: \"Daguerre\" and \"type\".\n\n**Step 3: Combine the clues to identify \"X Y\".**\n*   Our hypothesis from Step 2 is that \"X Y\" is **Daguerre type**.\n*   Let's check if this fits Clue 1. How is a \"Daguerre type\" pictured at the event?\n*   This is a puzzle with a clever, indirect link.\n    1.  A daguerreotype is a **type** of photograph. The image provided is, itself, a photograph. So in a literal sense, a \"type\" of image is \"pictured\".\n    2.  The critical connection comes from the person identified in the photo. Nikita Kucherov plays for the Tampa Bay **Lightning**. Lightning is a powerful flash of light. The creation of a photograph, including a daguerreotype, is fundamentally dependent on **light**.\n*   Therefore, the player from the \"Lightning\" team in the photograph serves as a pun or a direct thematic link to the \"Daguerre type,\" which is a light-based process.\n\n**Step 4: Final conclusion.**\n*   The first clue points to an image featuring the Tampa Bay **Lightning** player Nikita Kucherov.\n*   The second clue describes the **Daguerre type** photographic process, which used toxic mercury.\n*   The word \"Lightning\" provides the connection between the two clues.\n*   Thus, the answer \"X Y\" is **Daguerre type**.\n\n<<<Daguerre type>>>"
