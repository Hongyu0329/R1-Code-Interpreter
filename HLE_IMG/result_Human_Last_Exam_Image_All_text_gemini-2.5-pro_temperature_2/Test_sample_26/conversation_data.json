    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the harmony in measure 30 of Beethoven's \"Pathetique\" sonata, first movement.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Measure and Key Signature:**\n    *   The question asks for the analysis of measure 30. Looking at the sheet music, we can locate measure 28 at the start of the second system. Counting forward, the third measure of this system is measure 30. This measure is circled in the provided image.\n    *   The key signature at the beginning of the staff shows three flats (B♭, E♭, A♭). This indicates the key of C minor or its relative major, E♭ major. The context of the \"Pathetique\" sonata's first movement confirms the home key is C minor.\n\n2.  **Identify the Notes in Measure 30:**\n    *   **Left Hand (Bass Clef):** The left hand plays a G octave (G2 and G3) for the entire measure. This establishes G as the root of the harmony.\n    *   **Right Hand (Treble Clef):** The right hand plays a series of arpeggiated 32nd notes and a final eighth-note chord.\n        *   Beat 1: E♮ - G - D - G\n        *   Beat 2: F♯ - A - D - A\n        *   Beat 3: G - B♮ - D - B♮\n        *   Beat 4: A G-D dyad (an octave higher).\n    *   The notes E♮, F♯, and A in the first two beats are non-chord tones (passing tones or appoggiaturas) that create tension and lead towards the main harmony. The structurally important notes, particularly on the strong parts of the beats, are G, B♮, and D.\n\n3.  **Determine the Chord:**\n    *   Combining the notes from both hands, the essential harmonic structure is built on the notes G (bass), B♮, and D.\n    *   These three notes (G, B♮, D) form a G major triad. The B is natural, which is a crucial detail.\n\n4.  **Relate the Chord to the Key (Roman Numeral Analysis):**\n    *   The home key is C minor.\n    *   The scale of C minor is: C, D, E♭, F, G, A♭, B♭ (natural minor).\n    *   The dominant (the fifth scale degree) is G.\n    *   In minor keys, it is standard practice to raise the seventh scale degree to create a leading tone that resolves more strongly to the tonic. The raised 7th of C minor is B♮ (instead of B♭).\n    *   This alteration turns the diatonic minor dominant chord (G-B♭-D, a minor triad) into a major dominant chord (G-B♮-D, a major triad).\n    *   The Roman numeral for the dominant chord is V. Because it is a major triad, it is written as a capital Roman numeral: V. The chord in measure 30 is in root position, as the bass note is G.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Key Signature vs. Accidentals:** It is critical to note the B-natural (B♮) accidental in the right hand. The key signature indicates B-flat, but the accidental overrides it for this measure, making the chord a major triad.\n*   **Non-Chord Tones:** Don't get distracted by the rapid passing notes (like E♮, F♯, and A). Focus on the underlying harmony defined by the bass note and the stable, structurally important notes in the melody/arpeggiation.\n*   **Dominant Function in Minor Keys:** Remember that the use of a major dominant (V) chord in a minor key is the common-practice standard and is fundamental to creating tonal tension and resolution.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe notes in measure 30 spell a G major chord. In the key of C minor, the G major chord functions as the dominant. Therefore, the correct Roman numeral is V.\n\n<<<V>>>"
