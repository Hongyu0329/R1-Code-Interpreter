    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the element from its spectral lines.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the image**\nThe image provided is an emission spectrum. When atoms of an element are energized (for example, by heating them in a flame or passing an electric current through a gas), their electrons jump to higher energy levels. When they fall back to their original energy levels, they emit light. This light is not a continuous rainbow but consists of a series of discrete, bright lines at specific wavelengths (colors). The pattern of these lines is unique for each element, serving as its \"fingerprint\".\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the key features of the spectrum**\nTo identify the element, we need to carefully observe the pattern of the spectral lines, paying attention to their color (which corresponds to wavelength) and their relative brightness and spacing.\n*   **Wavelength Range:** The spectrum covers the visible light range, from violet/blue on the left to red on the right.\n*   **Most Prominent Feature:** The most striking and easily identifiable feature in this spectrum is a very bright, closely spaced pair of lines in the yellow-orange region. This feature is known as a doublet.\n*   **Other Features:** There are numerous other lines across the spectrum:\n    *   Several lines in the green region.\n    *   Several lines in the blue and violet regions.\n    *   A few lines in the red region.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the observed spectrum with known elemental spectra**\nNow, let's compare these features to the well-known spectra of some common elements.\n*   **Hydrogen:** The visible spectrum of hydrogen (the Balmer series) is very simple, consisting of only four prominent lines: one red, one blue-green, and two in the violet region. The spectrum in the image is much more complex, so it cannot be hydrogen.\n*   **Helium:** Helium has several bright lines, including a prominent yellow line (but it's a single line, not a doublet) and lines in the red, green, and blue regions. The pattern does not match the one shown.\n*   **Sodium:** Sodium is famous for producing an intensely bright yellow doublet (two lines very close together) at wavelengths of approximately 589.0 nm and 589.6 nm. This perfectly matches the most prominent feature observed in the image. Furthermore, the complete emission spectrum of sodium includes other, fainter lines in the green, blue, and red regions, which are also consistent with the provided image.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the identification**\nThe presence of the strong, characteristic yellow doublet is a definitive identifier for the element sodium. The other lines in the green, blue, and red parts of the spectrum confirm this identification. Therefore, the spectrum shown belongs to sodium.\n\n<<<Sodium>>>"
