    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the image to determine the book title:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Visual Elements:** The image shows a partial illustration from a book cover. The central figure is a ghostly, translucent unicorn with a visible horn, seemingly galloping. The unicorn is set against a dark, possibly forest-like background. On the right edge of the image, there is a portion of a yellowish, stone-like pillar or border.\n\n2.  **Identify the Artistic Style:** The art style, with its slightly whimsical and magical feel, is highly characteristic of the illustrations by Mary GrandPr√©, who created the cover and chapter art for the original US editions of the *Harry Potter* series.\n\n3.  **Connect the Image to a Specific Story:** The presence of a unicorn is a key plot point in the first book of the Harry Potter series. In the story, Harry Potter encounters a slain unicorn in the Forbidden Forest, a victim of Lord Voldemort who is drinking its blood to survive. This scene is a memorable and important part of the first book.\n\n4.  **Locate the Image on the Book Cover:** By examining the full cover art for the US edition of the first Harry Potter book, titled *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*, we can confirm the source of the fragment. The main cover features Harry looking into the Mirror of Erised, all framed by a decorative stone archway. The image of the unicorn is located on the far left side of the front cover, running in the background behind one of the framing pillars. The fragment provided is an exact match for this section of the cover art.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the unique illustration style and the specific subject matter that ties directly to the plot, the fragment is unequivocally from the cover of the first book in the Harry Potter series. The specific artwork is from the US edition.\n\n<<<Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"
