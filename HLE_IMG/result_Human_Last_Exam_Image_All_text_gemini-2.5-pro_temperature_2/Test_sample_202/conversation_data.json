    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the rock specimens.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\nThe goal is to identify the four rock specimens labeled H, I, J, and K by observing their key characteristics such as texture, color, and composition.\n\n1.  **Analyze Specimen H:**\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Texture.** The rock has a highly porous and bubbly appearance. This texture is called vesicular. It forms when gases trapped in lava escape as the rock cools and solidifies at the surface.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Color.** The rock is reddish-brown. The red color is often due to the oxidation of iron within the minerals.\n    *   **Conclusion:** A reddish, highly vesicular extrusive igneous rock is identified as **Scoria**.\n\n2.  **Analyze Specimen J:**\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Texture.** Similar to specimen H, this rock is also highly vesicular and looks lightweight. The holes, or vesicles, are numerous and small, giving it a frothy appearance.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Color.** The rock is very light-colored, ranging from white to light gray.\n    *   **Conclusion:** A light-colored, frothy, vesicular extrusive igneous rock is identified as **Pumice**. The light color indicates a felsic (silica-rich) composition, which distinguishes it from the more mafic (iron and magnesium-rich) scoria.\n\n3.  **Analyze Specimen I:**\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Texture and Composition.** This rock is composed of various fragments (clasts) cemented together in a fine-grained matrix. We can see smaller rock and mineral pieces of different colors (reddish, gray) and sizes. This is a clastic texture.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Origin.** Given the angularity of the fragments and the likely association with other volcanic rocks in this group, this is a pyroclastic rock. It formed from the accumulation of ash and larger fragments (known as lapilli) ejected during an explosive volcanic eruption.\n    *   **Conclusion:** A rock made of consolidated volcanic ash and lapilli is identified as **Tuff** (or more specifically, lapilli tuff).\n\n4.  **Analyze Specimen K:**\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Texture.** This rock is composed of large, interlocking mineral crystals that are easily visible to the naked eye. This coarse-grained texture is called phaneritic. A phaneritic texture indicates the rock cooled very slowly, deep underground.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Color and Mineralogy.** We can see different colored crystals: light-colored ones (likely quartz - grayish and glassy, and feldspar - white/pinkish) and some dark-colored ones (like biotite or hornblende). The overall light color indicates a felsic composition.\n    *   **Conclusion:** A coarse-grained (phaneritic), felsic (light-colored) intrusive igneous rock is identified as **Granite**.\n\n**Summary of Identifications:**\n*   **H:** Scoria (a type of volcanic rock)\n*   **I:** Tuff (a type of pyroclastic rock)\n*   **J:** Pumice (a type of volcanic rock)\n*   **K:** Granite (a type of intrusive igneous rock)\n\n<<<\nH: Scoria\nI: Tuff\nJ: Pumice\nK: Granite\n>>>"
