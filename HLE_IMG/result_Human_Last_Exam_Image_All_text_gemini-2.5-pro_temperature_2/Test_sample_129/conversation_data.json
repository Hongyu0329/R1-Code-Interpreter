    "*   **Step 1: Initial Image Analysis**\n    The image provided is a cartoon representation of a protein's three-dimensional structure. It shows a larger protein domain in dark blue and a smaller peptide chain in light blue, which is attached to the larger domain. There's also a small yellow stick representation, indicating a specific chemical bond, likely a covalent linkage between the two chains. The overall structure is composed of alpha-helices and beta-sheets, which are common secondary structures in proteins.\n\n*   **Step 2: Reverse Image Search and Identification**\n    Performing a reverse image search on this protein structure leads to the Protein Data Bank (PDB), a repository for 3D structural data of large biological molecules. The search identifies the structure as PDB entry `2B4C`.\n\n*   **Step 3: Analyzing the PDB Entry `2B4C`**\n    By looking up PDB ID `2B4C` on the RCSB PDB website, we can obtain detailed information about this structure.\n    *   **Title:** The official title for this entry is \"Crystal Structure of the Human Nedd8-activating Enzyme E1 in Complex with Nedd8\".\n    *   **Components:** The structure consists of two main molecules:\n        1.  **Chain A:** This is the catalytic domain of the **UBA3** subunit of the human **Nedd8-activating enzyme E1 (NAE)**. This corresponds to the larger dark blue portion of the image.\n        2.  **Chain C:** This is the protein **Nedd8** (Neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated 8), a ubiquitin-like modifier. This corresponds to the smaller light blue peptide.\n    *   **The Linkage:** The image depicts a crucial intermediate step in the \"neddylation\" pathway. The yellow structure represents a covalent thioester bond formed between a catalytic cysteine residue on the UBA3 subunit and the C-terminus of the Nedd8 protein. This is how the E1 enzyme \"activates\" Nedd8 before transferring it to the next enzyme in the cascade.\n\n*   **Step 4: Determining the Name**\n    The question asks for the name of the protein. The image shows a complex of an enzyme with its substrate. The primary enzyme shown is the Nedd8-activating enzyme E1 (NAE). Since the image shows the enzyme in the process of activating Nedd8, the most accurate and descriptive name is derived directly from the PDB entry's title.\n\n*   **Conclusion**\n    The protein is the **Nedd8-activating enzyme E1** shown in a complex with its target protein, **Nedd8**.\n\n<<<Nedd8-activating enzyme E1 in complex with Nedd8>>>"
