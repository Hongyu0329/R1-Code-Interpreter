    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the author of the artwork detail.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Visuals:** The image provided is a black and white photograph of a round, sculpted relief (a tondo) set within a decorative, rectangular frame. The scene within the tondo is religious. We see a priest giving communion (the Eucharist) to several kneeling figures, including at least one child and several adults who appear to be monks. The setting is indoors, with an altar and a candlestick visible on the left.\n2.  **Identify the Style and Medium:** The style of the figures is characteristic of the Italian Renaissance (c. 15th century). The forms are naturalistic, the compositions are balanced, and the figures have a sense of grace and calmness. The smooth, slightly reflective surface, even in black and white, suggests the medium is glazed terracotta (terracotta invetriata), a technique famously perfected and popularized during this period.\n3.  **Examine the Inscription:** At the bottom of the tondo, there is a scroll-like banner (cartouche) with a visible inscription. The text reads \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\". This is an archaic Italian/French phrase that translates to \"Sacrament of the Altar\", confirming the subject matter is the Eucharist.\n4.  **Synthesize the Clues:** We are looking for an Italian Renaissance artist known for:\n    *   Creating glazed terracotta reliefs.\n    *   Working in a classical, serene style.\n    *   Depicting religious subjects like the sacraments.\n    *   Creating tondos for altarpieces.\n\n5.  **Identify the Artist:** These characteristics strongly point to the workshop of the della Robbia family in Florence. The founder of the workshop, **Luca della Robbia** (c. 1399/1400â€“1482), is the most famous pioneer of this technique. His work is known for its elegant simplicity, clear compositions, and gentle, humanistic depiction of religious figures, which perfectly matches the style seen in the image.\n6.  **Confirm the Specific Artwork:** A search for \"Luca della Robbia Sacrament of the Altar\" or \"Luca della Robbia tondo Eucharist\" confirms this identification. The artwork is a predella panel from the **Tabernacle of the Sacrament** (Tabernacolo del Sacramento), created by Luca della Robbia around 1441-1443. It was originally made for the Church of Santa Maria in Peretola, Florence.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n\n*   **Distinguishing between della Robbia family members:** While Luca's nephew Andrea and grand-nephew Giovanni also ran the workshop, Luca's early work is generally considered more classical and restrained, as seen here. Later works by the family often become more colorful and crowded.\n*   **The Inscription:** The inscription \"SACRAMENTI DE L'AVTEL\" is a crucial and specific identifier that helps pinpoint the exact artwork.\n*   **The Medium:** Recognizing the likely medium as glazed terracotta is a key step that significantly narrows down the possible artists.\n*   **Context:** Understanding that this is a \"detail of the Altarpiece\" is important. It is a predella, which is the platform or step on which an altarpiece is set, often decorated with small scenes.\n\nBased on the style, medium, inscription, and historical records, the author is unequivocally identified.\n\n<<<Luca della Robbia>>>"
