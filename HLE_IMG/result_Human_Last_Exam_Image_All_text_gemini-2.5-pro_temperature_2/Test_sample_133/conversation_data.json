    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the mass spectrum to identify the unknown compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Base Peak and its Isotopic Cluster**\n*   The **base peak** is the most intense peak in the spectrum, which is defined as 100% relative intensity. From the table, the peak at **m/z = 225** has an intensity of 100%.\n*   We examine the peaks immediately following the base peak to identify any isotopic patterns. We see significant peaks at m/z = 227 (I = 66.7%) and m/z = 229 (I = 22.2%).\n*   Let's calculate the intensity ratios for this cluster (m/z 225, 227, 229):\n    *   I(225) : I(227) : I(229) = 100 : 66.7 : 22.2\n*   This pattern is highly characteristic of a fragment containing **two chlorine atoms**. The natural abundance of chlorine isotopes is ~75.8% for ³⁵Cl and ~24.2% for ³⁷Cl, giving a ³⁵Cl:³⁷Cl ratio of approximately 3:1.\n    *   For a fragment with two chlorines (Cl₂), the theoretical intensity ratio of the isotopic peaks M', M'+2, and M'+4 is approximately (3/4)² : 2(3/4)(1/4) : (1/4)² which simplifies to 9:6:1.\n    *   Normalized to 100 for the M' peak, this is approximately 100 : 67 : 11.\n*   Our observed ratio of 100 : 66.7 : 22.2 is an excellent match for the M' and M'+2 peaks (100:67). The M'+4 peak at m/z 229 is slightly more intense than predicted, which could be due to a small contribution from another fragment at the same m/z. However, the evidence strongly supports that the base peak at m/z 225 is part of a fragment containing two chlorine atoms, specifically [R-³⁵Cl₂]⁺.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Molecular Ion and Molecular Formula**\n*   The base peak at m/z 225 is a fragment ion, as it has an odd mass. It is likely formed by the cleavage of a single bond from the even-mass molecular ion, which typically involves the loss of a radical.\n*   A very common fragmentation pathway for halogenated compounds is the loss of a halogen radical (e.g., Cl•). Let's assume the fragment at m/z 225 was formed by the loss of one chlorine atom from the molecular ion (M⁺˙).\n*   If this is correct, the molecular ion must have contained **three chlorine atoms** (the two in the fragment plus the one that was lost).\n*   The nominal mass of the molecular ion (containing only the lightest isotopes, i.e., ³⁵Cl) would be the mass of the fragment plus the mass of the lost chlorine atom:\n    *   Nominal Mass (M) = Mass([R-³⁵Cl₂]⁺) + Mass(³⁵Cl) = 225 + 35 = 260 amu.\n*   We now check the high-mass region of the spectrum for a cluster corresponding to a molecular ion with three chlorine atoms and a nominal mass of 260.\n    *   A molecule with three chlorines (Cl₃) should show an isotopic cluster at M, M+2, M+4, and M+6 with a theoretical intensity ratio of approximately 27:27:9:1 (or normalized, 100:98:33:4).\n    *   Looking at the table, we find peaks at: m/z 260 (I=34.8%), m/z 262 (I=29.0%), m/z 264 (I=12.9%), and m/z 266 (I=3.22%).\n    *   The observed ratio is approximately 35:29:13:3. This is a very reasonable match for the theoretical Cl₃ pattern. The peaks at M (260) and M+2 (262) are of similar, high intensity, and the M+4 (264) and M+6 (266) peaks follow with decreasing intensity, as expected.\n    *   The presence of a peak at m/z 258 (I=17.4%) is likely due to the loss of H₂ from the molecular ion at m/z 260, a common process in aromatic compounds.\n*   We can now deduce the empirical formula of the non-halogenated part of the molecule. The molecular formula is RCl₃, and the nominal mass is 260. The fragment [RCl₂]⁺ has a mass of 225.\n    *   Mass(R) = Mass([RCl₂]⁺) - Mass(Cl₂) = 225 - (2 × 35) = 225 - 70 = 155 amu.\n*   Now we need to find a chemically plausible formula for R that has a mass of 155. R can contain C, H, and possibly O or N. Let's try some combinations:\n    *   C₁₂H₁₁: 12 × 12 + 11 × 1 = 144 + 11 = 155. (Possible)\n    *   **C₁₁H₇O**: 11 × 12 + 7 × 1 + 16 × 1 = 132 + 7 + 16 = 155. (Possible and structurally common)\n\n**Step 3: Propose a Structure and IUPAC Name**\n*   The formula C₁₁H₇OCl₃ is a very strong candidate. A common chemical scaffold for a C₁₁HₓO moiety is **methoxynaphthalene** (C₁₁H₁₀O). If this scaffold is trichlorinated, three hydrogen atoms are replaced by three chlorine atoms, leading to the molecular formula **C₁₁H₇Cl₃O**.\n*   This proposed structure is fully consistent with all our deductions:\n    1.  **Formula:** C₁₁H₇Cl₃O\n    2.  **Nominal Molecular Weight:** 260 amu.\n    3.  **Key Fragmentation:** Loss of a chlorine radical (Cl•) from the molecular ion [C₁₁H₇OCl₃]⁺˙ (m/z 260) to form the very stable, resonance-delocalized base peak fragment [C₁₁H₇OCl₂]⁺ (m/z 225).\n*   The compound is an isomer of trichloromethoxynaphthalene. The mass spectrum alone does not allow for the unambiguous determination of the substitution pattern of the chlorine atoms and the methoxy group on the naphthalene ring. However, we can provide a valid IUPAC name for one such possible isomer.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe unknown compound is an isomer of trichloromethoxynaphthalene, with the molecular formula C₁₁H₇Cl₃O. An example of a systematic IUPAC name for such a compound is **1,2,4-Trichloro-5-methoxynaphthalene**.\n\n<<<1,2,4-trichloro-5-methoxynaphthalene>>>"
