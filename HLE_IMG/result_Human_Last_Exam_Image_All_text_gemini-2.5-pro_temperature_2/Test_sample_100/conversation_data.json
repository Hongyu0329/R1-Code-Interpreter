    "**Step-by-step Analysis of the Reaction Sequence**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Analysis of the Starting Material**\n    *   The starting material is a bicyclic lactam. The core structure is a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one.\n    *   It has two substituents:\n        *   A p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) group on the nitrogen atom. The formula of the PMB group is -CH2-C6H4-OCH3.\n        *   A trifluoromethyl (CF3) group on the carbon-carbon double bond.\n    *   To determine the molecular formula of the starting material, we will count the atoms:\n        *   The bicyclic aza-enone core skeleton: C1(CH), N2(N), C3(C=O), C4(CH), C5(C-), C6(CH), C7(CH2). This part contains 6 Carbons, 5 Hydrogens, 1 Nitrogen, and 1 Oxygen (C6H5NO).\n        *   The PMB group (-C8H9O): 1 carbon in CH2, 6 carbons in the benzene ring, 1 carbon in the OCH3 group (total 8 C). 2 hydrogens in CH2, 4 hydrogens on the benzene ring, 3 hydrogens in the OCH3 group (total 9 H). 1 oxygen in the OCH3 group (1 O).\n        *   The trifluoromethyl group (-CF3): 1 Carbon, 3 Fluorine.\n    *   Total Molecular Formula of the Starting Material:\n        *   C: 6 (core) + 8 (PMB) + 1 (CF3) = 15\n        *   H: 5 (core) + 9 (PMB) = 14\n        *   F: 3\n        *   N: 1\n        *   O: 1 (core) + 1 (PMB) = 2\n        *   Formula: C15H14F3NO2\n\n2.  **Step 2: Formation of Intermediate 1**\n    *   **Reaction:** The starting material is treated with CAN (ceric ammonium nitrate) in ACN/H2O.\n    *   **Analysis:** CAN is a strong oxidizing agent commonly used for the deprotection of PMB ethers and amines. It cleaves the bond between the nitrogen and the benzylic carbon of the PMB group.\n    *   **Transformation:** The PMB group (-C8H9O) is removed, and a hydrogen atom is added to the nitrogen. The PMB group is oxidized to p-methoxybenzaldehyde.\n    *   **Change in Molecular Formula:** We remove the atoms of the PMB group (C8H9O) and add one hydrogen atom.\n        *   Net change: -C8, -H9, -O, +H  => -C8, -H8, -O\n    *   **Molecular Formula of Intermediate 1:**\n        *   From C15H14F3NO2:\n        *   C: 15 - 8 = 7\n        *   H: 14 - 8 = 6\n        *   F: 3\n        *   N: 1\n        *   O: 2 - 1 = 1\n        *   Formula of Intermediate 1: **C7H6F3NO**\n\n3.  **Step 3: Formation of Intermediate 2**\n    *   **Reaction:** Intermediate 1 is treated with H2 gas and a Palladium on Carbon catalyst (Pd/C) in methanol (MeOH).\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. This reaction typically reduces carbon-carbon double bonds (C=C). The C=O of the lactam and the C-F bonds are stable under these conditions.\n    *   **Transformation:** The C=C double bond in the bicyclic ring system is reduced to a C-C single bond by the addition of one molecule of hydrogen (H2).\n    *   **Change in Molecular Formula:** We add two hydrogen atoms (+H2).\n    *   **Molecular Formula of Intermediate 2:**\n        *   From C7H6F3NO:\n        *   C: 7\n        *   H: 6 + 2 = 8\n        *   F: 3\n        *   N: 1\n        *   O: 1\n        *   Formula of Intermediate 2: **C7H8F3NO**\n\n4.  **Step 4: Formation of the Final Product**\n    *   **Reaction:** Intermediate 2 is heated in 4 N HCl at 70 Â°C.\n    *   **Analysis:** These are conditions for the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of an amide. Intermediate 2 is a lactam (a cyclic amide). The hydrolysis reaction will break the amide bond (the N-C=O bond).\n    *   **Transformation:** The amide bond is cleaved by the addition of one molecule of water (H2O). This opens the bicyclic ring system to form an amino acid. The nitrogen atom becomes an amino group (-NH2) and the carbonyl carbon becomes a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).\n    *   **Change in Molecular Formula:** We add the atoms of one water molecule (+H2O).\n    *   **Molecular Formula of the Final Product:**\n        *   From C7H8F3NO:\n        *   C: 7\n        *   H: 8 + 2 = 10\n        *   F: 3\n        *   N: 1\n        *   O: 1 + 1 = 2\n        *   Formula of the Product: **C7H10F3NO2**\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition**\nThe final product is the result of the hydrolysis of Intermediate 2 (C7H8F3NO). The hydrolysis reaction consumes one molecule of water.\nTherefore, the molecular formula of the final product is C7H(8+2)F3NO(1+1), which simplifies to C7H10F3NO2.\n\n<<<C7H10F3NO2>>>"
