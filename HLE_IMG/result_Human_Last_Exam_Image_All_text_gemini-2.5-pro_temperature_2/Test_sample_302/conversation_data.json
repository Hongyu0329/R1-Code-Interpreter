    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the characters on the seal.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Script and Reading Direction:** The characters on the seal are carved in an ancient style called Seal Script (篆書, zhuànshū). A seal is used to make an impression, so the characters on the stone are a mirror image of how they will appear when stamped. The traditional reading order for a four-character Chinese text like this is from top to bottom, right to left.\n\n2.  **Mentally Flip the Image:** To read the seal's content, we must mentally flip the image horizontally to see the characters as they would appear in an impression.\n\n3.  **Identify Characters One by One (in reading order):**\n    *   **Top-Right Character (Top-left on the seal itself):** This character is `學` (xué). The seal script form clearly shows the components of the ancient character: a roof covering two hands teaching a child.\n    *   **Bottom-Right Character (Bottom-left on the seal itself):** This character is `海` (hǎi). The left part is the \"water\" radical (氵) and the right part is the phonetic component `每`. Both are rendered in the style of seal script.\n    *   **Top-Left Character (Top-right on the seal itself):** This character is `無` (wú). The seal script version is a complex, symmetrical character often representing a person dancing, which later evolved to mean \"without\" or \"nothing\".\n    *   **Bottom-Left Character (Bottom-right on the seal itself):** This character is `涯` (yá). The left part is the \"water\" radical (氵), and the right part is the phonetic component `厓`. The structure matches the seal script for `涯`.\n\n4.  **Combine the Characters:** Reading the characters in the correct order (top-right, bottom-right, top-left, bottom-left of the impression) gives us the phrase: `學海無涯`.\n\n5.  **Translate to Simplified Chinese:** The traditional phrase `學海無涯` is converted to simplified Chinese characters:\n    *   `學` becomes `学`\n    *   `海` remains `海`\n    *   `無` becomes `无`\n    *   `涯` remains `涯`\n    The resulting phrase is `学海无涯` (xué hǎi wú yá), which is a famous idiom meaning \"The sea of learning knows no bounds.\"\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Mirrored Characters:** It is essential to remember that seals are carved in reverse. The most common mistake is trying to read the characters directly from the seal stone.\n*   **Reading Order:** For square seals with four characters, the standard reading direction is from the right column (top to bottom) to the left column (top to bottom).\n*   **Seal Script:** The characters are in an archaic script. Direct comparison with modern characters can be misleading. Knowledge of or reference to seal script dictionaries is necessary for accurate identification.\n*   **Context:** Identifying parts of a common phrase (like `学海...`) can provide strong context clues to help decipher the remaining, more difficult characters.\n\n<<<学海无涯>>>"
