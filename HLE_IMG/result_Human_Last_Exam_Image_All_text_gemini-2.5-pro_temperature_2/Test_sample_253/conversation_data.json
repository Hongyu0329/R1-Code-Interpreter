    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of amino acids in the encoded XPH1 protein of the organism shown.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the organism in the image.**\n*   The image displays a vibrant yellow organism with a leafy, lobed structure (a foliose thallus) growing on a rock.\n*   There are also small, cup-like structures visible, which are apothecia (fruiting bodies).\n*   This morphology is characteristic of a lichen. The specific color and form are strong indicators of the species *Xanthoria parietina*, commonly known as the yellow wall lichen or maritime sunburst lichen.\n*   The information that the photo was taken in Acadia National Park, a coastal location, further supports this identification, as *Xanthoria parietina* is very common in such habitats.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the protein in question.**\n*   The question asks for the number of amino acids in the \"encoded XPH1 protein\".\n*   \"XPH1\" is a gene name. For the organism *Xanthoria parietina*, XPH1 stands for ***X*anthoria *p*arietina *h*otolyase *1***. Photolyases are enzymes that repair DNA damage from ultraviolet (UV) light, which is critical for an organism that grows exposed to the sun.\n\n**Step 3: Find the protein information in a biological database.**\n*   To find the length of a specific protein, we must consult a scientific protein database like UniProt (Universal Protein Resource), which is a comprehensive, high-quality, and freely accessible resource for protein sequence and functional information.\n*   A search is performed in UniProt for the XPH1 protein from the organism *Xanthoria parietina*.\n\n**Step 4: Retrieve the specific data from the database entry.**\n*   The search leads to the UniProt entry with the accession number **Q9HF73**.\n*   This entry corresponds to the \"Class 2 photolyase\" from *Xanthoria parietina*, and confirms the gene name is *xph1*.\n*   The database entry provides detailed information about the protein, including its length.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the final answer.**\n*   According to the UniProt entry Q9HF73, the length of the XPH1 protein sequence is explicitly stated. The protein consists of 582 amino acids.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Accurate Identification:** The initial identification of the lichen is crucial. The distinctive color, foliose form, presence of apothecia, and habitat information all point reliably to *Xanthoria parietina*.\n*   **Protein Name:** Understanding that \"XPH1\" is a specific gene identifier is key to a successful database search.\n*   **Data Source Reliability:** Using a curated and authoritative database like UniProt ensures the accuracy of the information retrieved.\n*   **Data Extraction:** One must locate the correct field within the database entry, which is the sequence length, representing the total number of amino acids.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently determine the size of the protein.\n\n<<<582>>>"
