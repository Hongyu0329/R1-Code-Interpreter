1. The music modulates to the key of **E minor**.
2. The original key is C# minor. Its relative major is E major (the mediant, III). The music modulates to E minor, which is the **parallel minor of the relative major**, or the **minor mediant (iii)**. This is a common and expressive modulation that maintains a close relationship to the home key while shifting the mood.
3. The chord on the first beat of measure 11 is an E minor triad. Since it is a minor triad built on the mediant (the 3rd scale degree) of the home key C# minor, its correct Roman numeral marking is **iii**.
