The regioselectivity in Reaction 3 is a result of the structural constraints imposed by the proline ring. The starting material, N-acetylproline, forms a bicyclic münchnone intermediate. As established by the isotopic labeling experiment in Reaction 2, the münchnone derived from the acyclic N-acetyl-N-methyl-alanine is in rapid equilibrium with a rearranged isomer (automerization), leading to a scrambled product. This scrambling is believed to proceed via an acyclic acylamino ketene intermediate. In Reaction 3, the α-substituent and the N-substituent of the amino acid are locked together in the rigid five-membered pyrrolidine ring. This structural constraint prevents the formation or subsequent rearrangement of the acylamino ketene intermediate, thereby inhibiting the scrambling pathway. Consequently, only a single, configurationally stable münchnone is formed. This single intermediate then undergoes the intrinsically regioselective [3+2] cycloaddition (the selectivity of which is demonstrated in Reaction 1) to yield a single product, Product B, with no evidence of the other potential isomers that would arise from scrambling.
