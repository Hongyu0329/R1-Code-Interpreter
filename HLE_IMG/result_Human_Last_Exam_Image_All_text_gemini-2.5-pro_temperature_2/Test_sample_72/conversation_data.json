    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the given chemical transformation to identify the pericyclic reactions involved.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Reactants and Reaction Conditions**\n*   **Reactant 1:** Hexafluorobenzene (C₆F₆). This is a substituted aromatic compound. Aromatic compounds like benzene can undergo photochemical rearrangements.\n*   **Reactant 2:** The second reactant is a four-membered ring with one double bond and a molecular formula of C₄H₄. This structure corresponds to cyclobutadiene, which is an anti-aromatic and highly reactive species.\n*   **Reaction Conditions:** The reaction is carried out under photochemical conditions, indicated by `hv` (light energy). This signifies that the reactions must follow the selection rules for photochemical pericyclic reactions (Woodward-Hoffmann rules).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the First Pericyclic Reaction**\nThe problem states that two photochemical pericyclic reactions occur. A common photochemical reaction of benzene and its derivatives is the valence isomerization to Dewar benzene. In this case, hexafluorobenzene isomerizes to hexafluoro Dewar benzene (hexafluorobicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene).\n\n*   **Reaction:** Hexafluorobenzene → Hexafluoro Dewar benzene.\n*   **Analysis:** This transformation involves the conversion of three π-bonds into one π-bond and two σ-bonds within a cyclic system. The three π-bonds of benzene constitute a 6π-electron system. The ring closure is therefore a **6π-electron electrocyclic reaction**.\n*   **Woodward-Hoffmann Rules for Electrocyclization:** For a system with (4n+2) π-electrons (where n=1, so 6π electrons), a photochemical reaction is allowed if it proceeds via a *disrotatory* pathway.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 1:** The first pericyclic reaction is a **6π-electron electrocyclic reaction**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Second Pericyclic Reaction**\nThe second reaction is an intermolecular reaction between the product of the first step (hexafluoro Dewar benzene) and the second reactant (cyclobutadiene).\n\n*   **Reactants for Step 2:** Hexafluoro Dewar benzene and cyclobutadiene.\n    *   Hexafluoro Dewar benzene has two isolated C=C double bonds (each is a 2π-electron system).\n    *   Cyclobutadiene has two C=C double bonds in a conjugated system (a 4π-electron system).\n*   **Reaction Type:** The addition of two molecules to form a cyclic adduct is a cycloaddition reaction. Several cycloadditions are possible, but we must consider which are photochemically allowed.\n*   **Woodward-Hoffmann Rules for Cycloaddition:**\n    *   [4+2] Cycloaddition (Diels-Alder): Total 6π electrons. Photochemically allowed only if one component reacts antarafacially ([π⁴s + π²a] or [π⁴a + π²s]), which is often sterically hindered. The suprafacial-suprafacial pathway ([π⁴s + π²s]) is photochemically forbidden.\n    *   [2+2] Cycloaddition: Total 4π electrons. The suprafacial-suprafacial pathway ([π²s + π²s]) is photochemically allowed. This is a very common photochemical reaction between two alkene-like systems.\n*   **Analysis:** The most plausible photochemical reaction between hexafluoro Dewar benzene and cyclobutadiene is a [2+2] cycloaddition. This would occur between one of the double bonds of hexafluoro Dewar benzene and one of the double bonds of cyclobutadiene.\n*   **Conclusion for Reaction 2:** The second pericyclic reaction is a **[2+2] cycloaddition**.\n\n**Step 4: Summary of the Transformation**\nThe overall transformation can be described as a two-step sequence:\n1.  **Electrocyclic Reaction:** Hexafluorobenzene undergoes a photochemical 6π-electron electrocyclization to form hexafluoro Dewar benzene.\n2.  **Cycloaddition Reaction:** The intermediate, hexafluoro Dewar benzene, then undergoes a photochemical [2+2] cycloaddition with cyclobutadiene to form the final product.\n\nBoth steps are well-established, photochemically allowed pericyclic reactions. Therefore, the two types of reactions involved are an electrocyclic reaction and a cycloaddition.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe question asks for the kinds of pericyclic reactions involved. Based on the analysis, the two reactions are:\n1.  A 6π-electron electrocyclic reaction.\n2.  A [2+2] cycloaddition.\n\nBoth reaction types need to be stated.\n\n<<<A 6π-electron electrocyclic reaction and a [2+2] cycloaddition>>>"
