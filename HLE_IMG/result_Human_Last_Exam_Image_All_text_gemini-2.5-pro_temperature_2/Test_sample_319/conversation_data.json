    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and the provided image to determine the name of the phenomenon.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Visual Information:** The image displays two related graphs.\n    *   **Top Graph (Spectrogram):** This graph shows the frequency content of a sound over time. We can observe a strong, thin horizontal line, which represents a pure tone of a constant frequency. This line is interrupted in the middle. Exactly at the point of interruption, there is a thick vertical band, which represents a sound containing a wide range of frequencies, such as a burst of white noise, static, or a cough. After the vertical band, the pure tone resumes. This graph shows the *physical* stimulus: a tone is played, it stops, a noise is played, and then the tone starts again.\n    *   **Bottom Graph (Waveform):** This shows the amplitude of the sound wave over time. It starts as a regular, smooth, periodic wave (a sine wave), corresponding to the pure tone. In the middle section, the waveform becomes irregular and complex, corresponding to the noise burst. Afterward, it returns to being a smooth, periodic sine wave. This confirms the physical structure of the sound event depicted in the spectrogram.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Textual Clues:**\n    *   **\"...an illusion...\"**: This is the most crucial clue. It means that what a person *perceives* when listening to this sound is different from the physical reality shown in the graphs.\n    *   **\"...similar to the Necker Cube's bistable ambiguity...\"**: The Necker Cube is a visual illusion where a 2D drawing can be perceived as a 3D cube in two different orientations. The brain flips between these two stable interpretations. This comparison suggests that the auditory phenomenon in question involves the brain interpreting incomplete or ambiguous sensory data and settling on a coherent perception.\n    *   **\"...reveals a surprisingly common, though usually unconscious, perceptual ability.\"**: This indicates that the phenomenon is not a rare trick but a fundamental part of how our perceptual system works, often without our awareness. It's a mechanism that helps us make sense of a complex world.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Clues to Identify the Phenomenon:**\n    *   We have a physical sound where a tone is interrupted by noise.\n    *   We are told this creates an illusion where perception differs from reality.\n    *   The brain's role is to resolve this situation, similar to how it resolves the Necker Cube's ambiguity.\n    *   When people listen to this stimulus, the common perception is that the tone continues *uninterrupted* through the noise. The brain \"fills in\" the missing part of the tone, assuming that the louder noise simply masked it.\n    *   This \"filling in\" of a missing sound segment is a prime example of a common, unconscious perceptual ability. It allows us to perceive continuous sounds (like speech or music) in noisy environments where parts of the sound might be momentarily obscured.\n\n4.  **Name the Phenomenon:** This auditory illusion, where a sound is perceived as continuing through an interval of masking noise, is known as the **Auditory Continuity Illusion**. When the sound being restored is a part of speech, it is more specifically called the **Phonemic Restoration Effect**, but the broader term covering tones and other sounds is the Auditory Continuity Illusion.\n\n<<<Auditory Continuity Illusion>>>"
