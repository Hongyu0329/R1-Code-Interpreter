    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Target Crystal Structure and Orientation:** The question asks to identify the crystal lattice pattern for a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure when viewed along the [110] crystallographic direction.\n\n2.  **Analyze the FCC Structure:**\n    *   An FCC unit cell has atoms at the eight corners of a cube and at the center of each of the six faces.\n    *   The atomic positions in a conventional unit cell (with lattice constant 'a') are:\n        *   Corners: (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1), (1,1,1) (in units of 'a').\n        *   Face centers: (1/2,1/2,0), (1/2,0,1/2), (0,1/2,1/2), and their equivalents in adjacent cells.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Viewing Direction [110]:**\n    *   \"Viewing along the [110] direction\" means we are projecting the 3D atomic positions onto a 2D plane that is perpendicular to the [110] vector. This plane is the (110) plane.\n    *   The position of atoms along the viewing direction (their \"depth\") depends on the projection of their position vector **r** = (x,y,z) onto the viewing vector **v** = [110]. This depth is proportional to **r** ⋅ **v** = x+y.\n\n4.  **Determine the Projected Pattern:**\n    *   Let's classify atoms based on their depth. We will have distinct layers of atoms perpendicular to the [110] direction.\n    *   **Layer A:** This layer includes atoms where (x+y) is an integer. For the FCC structure, this includes all the corner atoms and the face-center atoms on the (001) and (110) type planes (e.g., at (0,0,0) and (1/2, 1/2, 0)). When these atoms are projected onto the (110) plane, they form a simple rectangular lattice. The sides of this rectangle are 'a' and 'a√2'.\n    *   **Layer B:** This layer includes atoms where (x+y) is a half-integer (integer + 1/2). In an FCC lattice, these are the face-centered atoms on the (101) and (011) type planes (e.g., at (1/2, 0, 1/2) and (0, 1/2, 1/2)). When this layer of atoms is projected onto the same (110) plane, the atoms fall exactly in the center of the rectangles formed by the atoms of Layer A.\n    *   **Conclusion of Theory:** The combined projection of both layers results in a **centered rectangular lattice**. The final pattern shows a grid of rectangles, with an atom at each corner and another atom in the center of each rectangle.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Given Images:** Now, we must examine each image to see which one matches the \"centered rectangular lattice\" pattern.\n\n    *   **Image A:** This image shows atoms arranged in a simple rectangular grid. There are atoms at the corners of the rectangles, but no atoms in their centers. This pattern is characteristic of a simple cubic (SC) lattice viewed along [110]. It is not a centered rectangle.\n\n    *   **Image B:** The atoms in this image are arranged in a staggered fashion. This does not form a simple or centered rectangular lattice. This pattern is more characteristic of a body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n    *   **Image C:** The atoms in this image form a pattern with six-fold rotational symmetry (hexagonal). This is characteristic of a cubic lattice viewed along the [111] direction (for both FCC and BCC). It is clearly not a rectangular pattern.\n\n    *   **Image D:** Let's inspect this pattern closely.\n        *   We can identify a clear rectangular grid formed by some of the atoms. For instance, consider a rectangle with corners at approximately (1, 6), (3, 6), (1, 8.7), and (3, 8.7).\n        *   The center of this rectangle would be at x = (1+3)/2 = 2 and y = (6+8.7)/2 = 7.35.\n        *   Looking at the image, there is indeed an atom located at approximately (2, 7.3), which is the center of the rectangle.\n        *   This \"corner-and-center\" pattern repeats throughout the image. For example, the rectangle with corners (3, 6), (5, 6), (3, 8.7), (5, 8.7) has a center atom at (4, 7.3).\n        *   Therefore, Image D clearly shows a centered rectangular lattice.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion:** Based on the theoretical prediction and the analysis of the images, Image D correctly represents the pattern of an FCC crystal structure when viewed along the [110] direction.\n\n<<<D>>>"
