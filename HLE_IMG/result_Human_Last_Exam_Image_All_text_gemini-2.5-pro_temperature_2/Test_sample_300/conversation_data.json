The characters are fluid, connected, and have a unique, highly recognizable structure.\n    *   **Artist Identification:** This distinctive calligraphic style is known as \"Mao Style\" (毛体) and belongs to **Mao Zedong (毛泽东)**. The text is from a poem by Du Fu.\n\n4.  **Artwork 4 (Middle Row, Left):**\n    *   **Style Analysis:** This is another work of calligraphy, showing the same energetic and distinctive cursive script as the previous one.

The work exhibits meticulous attention to detail, light, and form, which is a hallmark of the Chinese school of Neoclassicism.\n    *   **Artist Identification:** This is a famous and iconic work titled \"Youth\" (or \"The Young Singer\", 《青年女歌手》) by **Jin Shangyi (靳尚谊)**, a leading figure in modern Chinese realist oil painting.\n\n6.  **Artwork 6 (Middle Row, Right):**\n    *   **Style Analysis:** This painting depicts a woman from an ethnic minority group. The style is a unique synthesis of Chinese ink and brush techniques with Western use of color and form. The figure has a stylized, melancholic elegance, and the composition is bold.\n    *   **Artist Identification:** This distinct style belongs to **Lin Fengmian (林風眠)**, a master who pioneered the blending of Chinese and Western art. His depictions of ladies are among his most celebrated subjects.\n\n7.  **Artwork 7 (Bottom Row, Left):**\n    *   **Style Analysis:** This is a colorful painting of a rural scene, featuring hanging gourds and laundry.

He painted many variations on this theme of a village courtyard.\n\n8.  **Artwork 8 (Bottom Row, Middle):**\n    *   **Style Analysis:** This is a traditional landscape (shan shui) painting showing a dramatic cliff and boats on a river.

Each segment of the body and the long antennae are drawn with confident, calligraphic lines that give the creature a sense of life and movement.\n    *   **Artist Identification:** The ability to capture the essence of small creatures, especially shrimps and prawns, with such simplicity and vitality is the unrivaled specialty of **Qi Baishi (齐白石)**, one of the most famous modern Chinese artists.\n\n<<<Shi Guoliang, Wu Guanzhong, Mao Zedong, Mao Zedong, Jin Shangyi, Lin Fengmian, Wu Guanzhong, Li Keran, Qi Baishi>>>"
