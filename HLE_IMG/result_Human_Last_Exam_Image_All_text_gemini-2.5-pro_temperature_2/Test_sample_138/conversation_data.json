    "Step-by-step analysis:\n\nThe goal is to determine the sex of each insect in the three paired images (A, B, C). We need to rely on the principles of sexual dimorphism in Hymenoptera (bees and wasps), paying attention to features like antennae, abdominal shape, and markings. The initial information states that these are pollinators from taxa without scopae (pollen-carrying hairs) on their legs.\n\n**Analysis of Pair A:**\n*   **Identification:** These bees belong to the genus *Coelioxys*, commonly known as cuckoo leafcutter bees. They are cleptoparasites, meaning they lay their eggs in the nests of other bees (typically *Megachile* leafcutter bees). As they do not collect pollen to provision their own nests, females lack scopae. This fits the description in the question.\n*   **Insect A (left):** This individual has a sharply pointed abdomen that tapers to a cone-like tip. This is a characteristic feature of a female *Coelioxys*. She uses this pointed abdomen to pierce the host's nest cell wall to lay her egg.\n*   **Insect A (right):** This individual's abdomen is not pointed. Instead, the tip is blunt and features several short spines or prongs. This multi-spined abdominal tip is characteristic of a male *Coelioxys*.\n*   **Conclusion for A:** Left is Female, Right is Male. This corresponds to option 4 (F, M).\n\n**Analysis of Pair B:**\n*   **Identification:** These insects are paper wasps, likely of the genus *Polistes*. Wasps do not have scopae for pollen collection, fitting the question's premise. Both males and females visit flowers for nectar.\n*   **Insect B (left):** This wasp has relatively short, straight antennae. Its abdomen tapers to a distinct point, which conceals the stinger. This is characteristic of a female.\n*   **Insect B (right):** This wasp has noticeably longer antennae that are distinctly curled at the tips. This is a classic sexual dimorphism in many wasps, and curled antennae are a hallmark of males. Additionally, the tip of its abdomen appears more rounded or blunt compared to the female.\n*   **Conclusion for B:** Left is Female, Right is Male. This corresponds to option 4 (F, M).\n\n**Analysis of Pair C:**\n*   **Identification:** These bees appear to be from the tribe Eucerini, known as long-horned bees. Females in this group *do* typically have large scopae on their hind legs, which seems to contradict the prompt. However, males lack scopae, and it's possible the prompt is meant to apply broadly to the collection or focuses on the absence of scopae in the specific individuals shown (e.g., the male). The most reliable features for sexing these bees are the antennae.\n*   **Insect C (left):** This bee possesses extremely long antennae, which is the defining characteristic of male long-horned bees. These long antennae are used to detect females.\n*   **Insect C (right):** This bee has much shorter antennae, which are typical for a female of this tribe. Her body is robust, and the coloration with bright yellow abdominal bands is common in females of certain species within this group (e.g., *Melissodes bimaculata*).\n*   **Conclusion for C:** Left is Male, Right is Female. This corresponds to option 3 (M, F).\n\n**Final Answer Compilation:**\n*   For pair A, the sexes are (Female, Male), which is index **4**.\n*   For pair B, the sexes are (Female, Male), which is index **4**.\n*   For pair C, the sexes are (Male, Female), which is index **3**.\n\nThe final answer, formatted as requested, is the sequence of indices for A, B, and C.\n\n<<<4, 4, 3>>>"
