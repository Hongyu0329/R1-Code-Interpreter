The products A, B, and C have the following proposed structures based on the reaction analysis:

*   **Product A (C₁₄H₂₀N₂O₃):** Structure cannot be unambiguously determined from the given data, likely a product of further reaction or a 1:2 adduct.
*   **Product B (C₁₂H₁₄N₂O₃):** A pyrrolizinone derivative formed via [3+2] cycloaddition of an azomethine ylide (from the starting material and Ac₂O) with methyl propiolate, followed by decarboxylation and oxidation. Its structure is methyl 5-methyl-6-oxo-2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-pyrrolizine-7-carboxylate, with a (3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-5-yl) group attached to the pyrrolizine nitrogen. (A representative structure is provided in the detailed analysis).
*   **Product C (C₁₁H₁₆N₂O₃):** The N-acetylation product of the enamine tautomer of the starting material. Its structure is 1-(1-acetyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-2-yl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid.
