    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to identify the title and composer of the provided jazz standard:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Key and Time Signature**\n*   The key signature has one flat (B♭), which indicates the key of F major or its relative minor, D minor.\n*   The time signature is 4/4, also known as common time.\n*   The piece begins and ends on an F chord (specifically F minor or F), suggesting that F is the tonic center. The prevalence of F minor chords (F-) throughout confirms the key is likely F minor.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Chord Progression**\n*   The first four bars feature a very distinctive chromatic chord progression:\n    *   Bar 1: F- (F minor)\n    *   Bar 2: E-♭5 (E half-diminished 7th, or Eø7)\n    *   Bar 3: E♭-6 (E-flat minor 6th)\n    *   Bar 4: D♭maj7 (D-flat major 7th)\n*   This progression, where the root of the chord descends chromatically (F -> E -> E♭ -> D♭), is a famous musical device known as a \"line cliché\". It is the defining characteristic of a specific, well-known jazz standard.\n*   The rest of the progression follows standard jazz harmony. For instance, the A section continues with a G7 to C7 progression, which is a ii-V progression leading back to the tonic, F minor. The B section (bridge) starts with a D-7♭5, which is the ii chord in the key of C minor (the dominant of F minor), another common harmonic move.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Melody**\n*   The melody in the first four bars mirrors the descending harmony:\n    *   Bar 1: The notes are A and G.\n    *   Bar 2: The notes are F and E.\n    *   Bar 3: The notes are E♭ and D.\n    *   Bar 4: The note is D♭.\n*   This stepwise descending melodic line, perfectly aligned with the descending chromatic chords, strongly reinforces the identity of the tune.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Tune**\n*   The unique chromatic progression and accompanying descending melody in the first four bars are the unmistakable hallmark of the jazz standard **\"Yesterdays\"**.\n*   This piece is one of the most famous examples of the descending chromatic line cliché in the jazz repertoire.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Composer**\n*   The composer of \"Yesterdays\" is **Jerome Kern**. The song was written in 1933 for the musical *Roberta*, with lyrics by Otto Harbach.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Handwritten Score:** The score is handwritten, so some notation might be slightly ambiguous (e.g., the F- chord in the first bar with an A natural note implies an F minor-major 7th sound, a common jazz coloration).\n*   **Harmonic Variations:** Jazz musicians often reharmonize standards. The bridge in this particular lead sheet (D-7♭5 | G7 | C7 | F7...) is a slight but common variation on the original harmony, but it still functions to lead back to the final A section, and its initial D-7b5 | G7 sequence is a strong clue.\n*   **Uniqueness of the Progression:** The opening four bars are so distinctive that they are almost sufficient on their own to identify the piece as \"Yesterdays\".\n\nBy combining these analytical steps, the identity of the piece is conclusively determined.\n\n<<<Title: Yesterdays, Composer: Jerome Kern>>>"
