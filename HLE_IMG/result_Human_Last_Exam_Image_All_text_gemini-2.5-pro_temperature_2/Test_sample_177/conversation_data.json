    "**Analysis of the Question and Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Objective:** The goal is to determine the percentage reduction in Car Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) when switching from the Baseline (Table 1) to the Proposed (Table 2) transportation plan.\n\n2.  **Formula for Percentage Reduction:** The standard formula is:\n    `((Original Value - New Value) / Original Value) * 100%`\n    In this case: `((Baseline Car VMT - Proposed Car VMT) / Baseline Car VMT) * 100%`\n\n3.  **Definition of Car VMT:** VMT stands for Vehicle Miles Traveled. It measures the total distance traveled by vehicles.\n    *   **Key Point:** It is *not* Person Miles Traveled (PMT). Therefore, the number of occupants in a car does not affect its VMT. A car trip of 10 miles contributes 10 miles to the VMT, whether it has 1 occupant or 3.\n    *   **Implication:** The \"Average Carpool Occupancy\" data (2.8 and 3) is extraneous information and should be ignored for this calculation.\n    *   **Car Modes:** We must include all car trips. This means summing the VMT from both \"car, 1 occupant\" and \"car, with more than 2 occupants\".\n\n4.  **Calculation Structure:**\n    *   The data is broken down into four trip distance categories. We must calculate the total VMT for each scenario (Baseline and Proposed) by summing the VMT contributed by each of these four categories.\n    *   The tables use percentages, not absolute numbers. We can calculate a relative VMT figure (e.g., the average VMT per 100 total trips). The total number of trips assumed will cancel out when we calculate the percentage reduction, so we can work directly with the percentages as proportions.\n    *   **Formula for a single segment's VMT contribution:**\n        `VMT_segment = (Share of total trips in segment) * (Total car mode share in segment) * (Average trip distance for segment)`\n\n**Step-by-step Calculation**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total Baseline Car VMT (as a relative value)**\n\n*   **0-3 miles segment:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 48% (0.48)\n    *   Total car share: 25% + 28% = 53% (0.53)\n    *   Average distance: 1 mile\n    *   VMT contribution: `0.48 * 0.53 * 1 = 0.2544`\n*   **3-5 miles segment:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 22% (0.22)\n    *   Total car share: 38% + 43% = 81% (0.81)\n    *   Average distance: 4 miles\n    *   VMT contribution: `0.22 * 0.81 * 4 = 0.7128`\n*   **5-10 miles segment:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 14% (0.14)\n    *   Total car share: 40% + 45% = 85% (0.85)\n    *   Average distance: 7.5 miles\n    *   VMT contribution: `0.14 * 0.85 * 7.5 = 0.8925`\n*   **10+ miles segment:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 16% (0.16)\n    *   Total car share: 42% + 47% = 89% (0.89)\n    *   Average distance: 20 miles\n    *   VMT contribution: `0.16 * 0.89 * 20 = 2.8480`\n*   **Total Baseline Car VMT:**\n    `0.2544 + 0.7128 + 0.8925 + 2.8480 = 4.7077`\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the total Proposed Car VMT (as a relative value)**\n\n*   **0-3 miles segment:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 48% (0.48)\n    *   Total car share: 1% + 2% = 3% (0.03)\n    *   Average distance: 1 mile\n    *   VMT contribution: `0.48 * 0.03 * 1 = 0.0144`\n*   **3-5 miles segment:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 22% (0.22)\n    *   Total car share: 8% + 19% = 27% (0.27)\n    *   Average distance: 4 miles\n    *   VMT contribution: `0.22 * 0.27 * 4 = 0.2376`\n*   **5-10 miles segment:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 14% (0.14)\n    *   Total car share: 14% + 27% = 41% (0.41)\n    *   Average distance: 7.5 miles\n    *   VMT contribution: `0.14 * 0.41 * 7.5 = 0.4305`\n*   **10+ miles segment:**\n    *   Share of total trips: 16% (0.16)\n    *   Total car share: 16% + 33% = 49% (0.49)\n    *   Average distance: 20 miles\n    *   VMT contribution: `0.16 * 0.49 * 20 = 1.5680`\n*   **Total Proposed Car VMT:**\n    `0.0144 + 0.2376 + 0.4305 + 1.5680 = 2.2505`\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Percentage Reduction in Car VMT**\n\n*   **Baseline VMT:** 4.7077\n*   **Proposed VMT:** 2.2505\n*   **Reduction Amount:** `4.7077 - 2.2505 = 2.4572`\n*   **Percentage Reduction:** `(2.4572 / 4.7077) * 100% = 52.195%`\n\nRounding to one decimal place, the reduction is 52.2%.\n\n<<<52.2>>>"
