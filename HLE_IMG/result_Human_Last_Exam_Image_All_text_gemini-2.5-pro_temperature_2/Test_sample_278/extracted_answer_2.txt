Based on the microscopic image, the organism is classified as a dimorphic **fungus**. The morphology is characterized by the presence of both **budding yeasts** (small, oval cells) and **pseudohyphae** (chains of elongated yeast cells with constrictions at the septa). This combination of features is highly characteristic of the genus **Candida**.
