    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Step 1: Friedel-Crafts Acylation**\n    *   **Reactants:** Benzene (C₆H₆) and propanoyl chloride (CH₃CH₂COCl).\n    *   **Reagent:** AlCl₃ (Aluminum chloride), a Lewis acid catalyst.\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a classic Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction. The AlCl₃ activates the propanoyl chloride by coordinating to the chlorine atom, facilitating the formation of an electrophilic acylium ion (CH₃CH₂C⁺=O). The nucleophilic benzene ring then attacks this acylium ion in an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction.\n    *   **Intermediate-1:** The product is propiophenone, also known as 1-phenylpropan-1-one. Its structure is a phenyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon of a propanoyl group (C₆H₅-CO-CH₂CH₃).\n\n2.  **Step 2: Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (Bromination)**\n    *   **Reactant:** Intermediate-1 (Propiophenone).\n    *   **Reagents:** Br₂ (Bromine) and FeBr₃ (Iron(III) bromide), a Lewis acid catalyst.\n    *   **Reaction:** This is an electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination) on the phenyl ring of propiophenone. The acyl group (-COCH₂CH₃) attached to the ring is an electron-withdrawing group and acts as a deactivator and a *meta*-director. This means the incoming electrophile (the \"Br⁺\" generated from Br₂/FeBr₃) will be directed to the position *meta* to the acyl group.\n    *   **Intermediate-2:** The product is 3'-bromopropiophenone, or using IUPAC nomenclature, 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one. A bromine atom is attached to the phenyl ring at position 3 (the meta position).\n\n3.  **Step 3: Catalytic Hydrogenation (Reduction)**\n    *   **Reactant:** Intermediate-2 (1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one).\n    *   **Reagents:** H₂ (Hydrogen gas) and Pd (Palladium), a metal catalyst.\n    *   **Reaction:** This is a catalytic hydrogenation reaction. H₂/Pd is a common reducing agent for ketones and aldehydes, converting the carbonyl group (C=O) into an alcohol group (-CHOH). Under these typical conditions, the aryl bromide bond is stable and will not be reduced (a reaction known as hydrogenolysis, which usually requires harsher conditions).\n    *   **Intermediate-3:** The ketone group is reduced to a secondary alcohol. The product is 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-ol.\n\n4.  **Step 4: Oxidation with NBS**\n    *   **Reactant:** Intermediate-3 (1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-ol).\n    *   **Reagents:** NBS (N-Bromosuccinimide), (PhCO₂)₂ (benzoyl peroxide, a radical initiator), and CCl₄ (carbon tetrachloride, a non-polar solvent).\n    *   **Reaction:** These reagents are characteristic of a free-radical reaction. NBS in the presence of a radical initiator typically brominates at allylic or benzylic positions. Here, the reactant is a secondary *benzylic* alcohol (the -OH group is on a carbon directly attached to the benzene ring). The benzylic hydrogen (the H on the same carbon as the OH group) is readily abstracted by a bromine radical. This forms a benzylic radical, which then reacts with NBS to form a geminal bromoalcohol (a compound with a -Br and an -OH on the same carbon). This intermediate is unstable and rapidly eliminates HBr to form a stable ketone. The overall process is the oxidation of the secondary alcohol back to a ketone.\n    *   **Final Product:** The alcohol group of Intermediate-3, 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-ol, is oxidized back to a ketone group. This reforms the carbonyl group, resulting in 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one, which is identical to Intermediate-2.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe sequence of reactions produces 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one.\n*   **Intermediate-1:** Propiophenone\n*   **Intermediate-2:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one\n*   **Intermediate-3:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-ol\n*   **Final Product:** 1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one\n\n<<<1-(3-bromophenyl)propan-1-one>>>"
