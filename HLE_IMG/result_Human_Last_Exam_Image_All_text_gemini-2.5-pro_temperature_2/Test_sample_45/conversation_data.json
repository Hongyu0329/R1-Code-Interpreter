    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the rotational symmetry of the tiling:\n\n**1. Understand the Question:**\nThe goal is to determine the rotational symmetry of the provided tiling pattern. Rotational symmetry of order 'n' (or n-fold symmetry) means that if the pattern is rotated around a central point by an angle of 360/n degrees, it will look identical to the original pattern. The question asks for \"the\" rotational symmetry, which conventionally refers to the highest order of symmetry present in the pattern.\n\n**2. Identify the Shapes and Motifs:**\nThe tiling is composed of three types of polygons:\n*   Blue hexagons\n*   Light-yellow squares\n*   Orange rhombuses\n\nThese shapes are arranged in a repeating, periodic pattern.\n\n**3. Locate Potential Centers of Rotation:**\nTo find the rotational symmetry, we need to identify points in the tiling that can serve as centers of rotation. Good candidates for these centers are the centers of the polygons themselves or the vertices where multiple polygons meet.\n\n**4. Test for Different Orders of Rotational Symmetry:**\n\n*   **Test Point 1: Center of a blue hexagon.**\n    *   **Observation:** Each blue hexagon is surrounded by six identical arrangements. Each arrangement consists of a yellow square attached to a side of the hexagon, and an orange rhombus located at the corner of the hexagon.\n    *   **Analysis:** If we place a rotation center at the very middle of a blue hexagon and rotate the entire tiling by 360° / 6 = 60°, each of these six surrounding arrangements will move into the position of its neighbor. The entire tiling will look exactly the same after this rotation.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This confirms that the tiling has **6-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\n*   **Test Point 2: Center of a yellow square.**\n    *   **Observation:** Each yellow square is surrounded by four orange rhombuses and four blue hexagons at its corners.\n    *   **Analysis:** Rotating the pattern by 360° / 4 = 90° around the center of a square maps the square, and its entire surroundings, onto itself.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The tiling also has centers of **4-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\n*   **Test Point 3: Vertices where shapes meet.**\n    *   **Observation:** There are points where the corners of two hexagons and one rhombus meet. There are also points where the corners of two squares and two rhombuses meet.\n    *   **Analysis:** At the vertices where two hexagons and one rhombus meet, a rotation of 360° / 3 = 120° maps the pattern onto itself, indicating **3-fold rotational symmetry**. At the vertices where two squares and two rhombuses meet, a rotation of 360° / 2 = 180° maps the pattern onto itself, indicating **2-fold rotational symmetry**.\n\n**5. Determine the Final Answer:**\nThe tiling pattern possesses centers of 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold rotational symmetry. When describing the symmetry of a periodic tiling, the highest order of rotation present is used to classify it. In this case, the highest order is 6.\n\nTherefore, the rotational symmetry of the tiling is 6-fold.\n\n<<<6-fold rotational symmetry>>>"
