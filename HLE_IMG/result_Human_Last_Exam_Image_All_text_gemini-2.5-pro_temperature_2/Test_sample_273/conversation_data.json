    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the absolute configuration of the molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the chiral centers and the drawing convention.**\n\n1.  A chiral center (or stereocenter) is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. In the given molecule, there are three such centers along the main carbon backbone. Let's label them C2, C3, and C4 from left to right for the purpose of this analysis.\n2.  The drawing uses a wedge-and-dash notation on a zig-zag backbone.\n    *   **Solid wedges** represent bonds coming out of the plane of the paper (towards the viewer).\n    *   **Dashed wedges** represent bonds going into the plane of the paper (away from the viewer).\n    *   **Plain lines** represent bonds lying in the plane of the paper. This includes the C-C bonds of the zig-zag backbone and any implied C-H bonds unless otherwise specified.\n3.  Each chiral carbon is tetrahedral. The configuration is determined by assigning priorities to the four substituents and observing their spatial arrangement.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the configuration of the leftmost chiral center (C2).**\n\n1.  **Identify substituents:** This carbon (C2) is bonded to:\n    *   An -OH group (hydroxyl), shown with a **wedge** (towards viewer).\n    *   A -CH3 group (methyl), shown with a **dash** (away from viewer).\n    *   The rest of the carbon chain (C3), shown with a **plain line** (in plane).\n    *   A hydrogen atom (-H), which is not explicitly drawn but is implied to complete the tetrahedron. Since one substituent is wedged, one is dashed, and one is in the plane, the hydrogen atom must also be **in the plane**.\n2.  **Assign priorities (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules):**\n    *   Priority is based on the atomic number of the atom directly attached to the chiral center. Higher atomic number gets higher priority.\n    *   1: -OH (Oxygen, Z=8)\n    *   2: -C3(-CH(C2H5)-...) (Carbon, bonded to other carbons)\n    *   3: -CH3 (Carbon, bonded only to hydrogens)\n    *   4: -H (Hydrogen, Z=1)\n3.  **Determine R/S configuration:** The lowest priority group (-H, priority 4) lies in the plane of the paper. In this situation, we can use the following method:\n    *   Trace the path from priority 1 → 2 → 3. In this case, it goes from the wedged -OH (front) to the in-plane -C3 (right) to the dashed -CH3 (back). This traces a **clockwise (CW)** path.\n    *   Use the right-hand rule for a group in the plane. Point your right thumb along the vector of the lowest priority group (-H, which points to the left in the plane). Your fingers curl in a **counter-clockwise (CCW)** direction.\n    *   Compare the two directions. The path direction (CW) is opposite to the thumb-rule direction (CCW). When they are opposite, the configuration is **S**.\n    *   Therefore, the leftmost chiral center is **(S)**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the configuration of the middle chiral center (C3).**\n\n1.  **Identify substituents:** This carbon (C3) is bonded to:\n    *   A -CH2CH3 group (ethyl), shown with a **wedge** (towards viewer).\n    *   The C2 group, shown with a **plain line** (in plane).\n    *   The C4 group, shown with a **plain line** (in plane).\n    *   A hydrogen atom (-H). Since two bonds are in the plane and one is wedged, the H atom must be on a **dashed** bond (away from viewer) to satisfy tetrahedral geometry.\n2.  **Assign priorities:**\n    *   1: -C2 group (-CH(OH)CH3). The carbon is bonded to O, C, H. The oxygen gives it the highest priority among the carbon-based groups.\n    *   2: -C4 group (-CH(CH3)CH2NH2). The carbon is bonded to C, C, H.\n    *   3: -CH2CH3 group (ethyl). The carbon is bonded to C, H, H.\n    *   4: -H (hydrogen).\n3.  **Determine R/S configuration:** The lowest priority group (-H, priority 4) is pointing away from the viewer (dashed). This is the simplest case.\n    *   Trace the path from priority 1 → 2 → 3. The path goes from the C2 group (left) to the C4 group (right) to the ethyl group (front). This traces a **counter-clockwise (CCW)** path.\n    *   When the lowest priority group is away, a CCW path corresponds to the **S** configuration.\n    *   Therefore, the middle chiral center is **(S)**.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the configuration of the rightmost chiral center (C4).**\n\n1.  **Identify substituents:** This carbon (C4) is bonded to:\n    *   A -CH2NH2 group (aminomethyl), shown with a **wedge** (towards viewer).\n    *   A -CH3 group (methyl), shown with a **dash** (away from viewer).\n    *   The C3 group, shown with a **plain line** (in plane).\n    *   A hydrogen atom (-H), which must be **in the plane**.\n2.  **Assign priorities:**\n    *   1: -CH2NH2 (The carbon is attached to Nitrogen, Z=7).\n    *   2: -C3 group (Carbon attached to other carbons).\n    *   3: -CH3 (Carbon attached only to hydrogens).\n    *   4: -H (hydrogen).\n3.  **Determine R/S configuration:** The lowest priority group (-H, priority 4) is in the plane.\n    *   Trace the path from priority 1 → 2 → 3. It goes from the wedged -CH2NH2 (front) to the in-plane -C3 (left) to the dashed -CH3 (back). This path is **counter-clockwise (CCW)**. (Visualize moving from in front of you, to your left, then to behind you).\n    *   Use the right-hand rule. Point your right thumb along the vector of the lowest priority group (-H, which points up in the plane). Your fingers curl in a **counter-clockwise (CCW)** direction.\n    *   Compare the two directions. The path direction (CCW) is the same as the thumb-rule direction (CCW). When they are the same, the configuration is **R**.\n    *   Therefore, the rightmost chiral center is **(R)**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nCombining the results for the three chiral centers from left to right, the absolute configuration of the molecule is (2S, 3S, 4R).\n\n<<< (2S, 3S, 4R) >>>"
