    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Understanding the Graph:** The graph is a raster plot. The x-axis represents time in seconds (s), and the y-axis represents the electrode number (from 0 to 128). Each black dot indicates a neuronal firing event (a \"spike\") recorded at a specific electrode at a specific time.\n*   **Identifying Synchronized Bursts:** A \"synchronized burst\" is a period of intense, nearly simultaneous firing across a large number of neurons (electrodes). Visually, these correspond to dense vertical bands of dots that stand out from the background firing activity.\n*   **Estimating Timestamps:** The x-axis has major ticks every 10 seconds. We must visually estimate the time of each burst. A consistent method, such as using the onset (start) time of each burst, is crucial for accurate interval calculation.\n*   **Calculating Inter-Burst Interval (IBI):** The IBI is the time difference between consecutive bursts. If we identify N bursts, we can calculate N-1 intervals.\n*   **Calculating the Average:** The average IBI is the sum of all individual IBIs divided by the number of intervals.\n*   **Significant Figures:** The final answer must be reported to two significant figures, which requires proper rounding rules.\n\n---\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Identify the timestamps of synchronized bursts**\n\nFirst, we visually scan the raster plot to locate the dense, vertical bands that represent synchronized bursts. We can identify five major bursts in the 50-second recording period. We will estimate the onset time for each of these bursts.\n\n*   **Burst 1:** The first clear burst starts at approximately **t₁ = 2 s**.\n*   **Burst 2:** The second burst starts at approximately **t₂ = 14 s**.\n*   **Burst 3:** The third burst starts at approximately **t₃ = 24 s**.\n*   **Burst 4:** The fourth burst starts at approximately **t₄ = 35 s**.\n*   **Burst 5:** The fifth and final major burst in this recording starts at approximately **t₅ = 48 s**.\n\nThe identified timestamps for the synchronized bursts are approximately 2 s, 14 s, 24 s, 35 s, and 48 s.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the individual inter-burst intervals (IBIs)**\n\nNext, we calculate the time difference between the onsets of consecutive bursts. This gives us four inter-burst intervals.\n\n*   **IBI₁** (between Burst 2 and Burst 1) = t₂ - t₁ = 14 s - 2 s = **12 s**\n*   **IBI₂** (between Burst 3 and Burst 2) = t₃ - t₂ = 24 s - 14 s = **10 s**\n*   **IBI₃** (between Burst 4 and Burst 3) = t₄ - t₃ = 35 s - 24 s = **11 s**\n*   **IBI₄** (between Burst 5 and Burst 4) = t₅ - t₄ = 48 s - 35 s = **13 s**\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the average inter-burst interval**\n\nNow, we compute the average of the four calculated IBIs.\n\n*   Sum of all IBIs = 12 s + 10 s + 11 s + 13 s = 46 s\n*   Number of intervals = 4\n*   Average IBI = (Sum of all IBIs) / (Number of intervals) = 46 s / 4 = **11.5 s**\n\n**Step 4: Round the answer to two significant figures**\n\nThe question specifies that the final answer must be given to two significant figures.\n\n*   The calculated average is 11.5. This number has three significant figures (1, 1, 5).\n*   To round to two significant figures, we examine the third digit. Since the third digit is 5, we round up the preceding digit.\n*   Therefore, 11.5 rounded to two significant figures is 12.\n\nThe average inter-burst interval is 12 s.\n\n<<<12>>>"
