    "*   **Step 1: Analyze the Image and Question.**\n    The image presents a line drawing of an ancient cuneiform sign. The question asks for the meaning of this specific sign as it appeared in the third millennium BCE. This historical context is important because cuneiform signs evolved over time, changing in both form and sometimes meaning. The style shown is pictographic and archaic, consistent with the specified period.\n\n*   **Step 2: Identify the Cuneiform Sign.**\n    The sign depicted is a well-known Sumerian cuneiform sign. Its form is clearly a pictograph. The rectangular base with internal lines represents the floor plan of a building, and the triangular structure on top likely represents the roof or entrance. This is the archaic form of the sign **Ã‰**.\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the Meaning of the Sign.**\n    In the Sumerian language, the sign **Ã‰** means \"house\" or \"temple.\" It is one of the most fundamental words and signs in the Mesopotamian writing system. It was used both as a logogram (a sign representing a whole word, in this case, \"house\") and as a determinative placed before the names of temples to indicate that the name referred to a building (e.g., Ã‰.KUR, \"House of the Mountain,\" the name of a famous temple in Nippur).\n\n*   **Step 4: Evaluate the Answer Choices.**\n    *   **A. Tool:** Incorrect. Signs for tools (e.g., plow, pickaxe) had different pictographic origins and forms.\n    *   **B. Guard:** Incorrect. This sign does not represent a person or a profession like a guard.\n    *   **C. Bread:** Incorrect. The sign for bread (Sumerian: ninda, sign: GAR) typically looks like a food bowl.\n    *   **D. Home:** Correct. \"Home\" is a synonym for \"house,\" which is the direct meaning of the sign Ã‰.\n    *   **E. Deity:** Incorrect. The sign for a deity (Sumerian: dingir, sign: ð’€­) is a star symbol.\n    *   **F. Beard:** Incorrect. The sign for beard (Sumerian: suâ‚†) has a different form, often representing facial hair.\n\n*   **Step 5: Conclude.**\n    The cuneiform sign shown is the archaic form of Ã‰, which means \"house\" or \"temple.\" Therefore, the best answer choice is \"Home.\"\n\n<<<D>>>"
